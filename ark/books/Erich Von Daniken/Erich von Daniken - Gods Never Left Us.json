In the introduction Istated, “Writing this book requires courage—reading it no less so. Because itshypotheses and evidence do not fit into the laboriously constructed mosaic ofestablished conventional wisdom, scholars will put it on the list of those bookswhich it is advisable not to talk about.” Meanwhile, 50 years have passed. Myintroduction from that time still stands today. The Gods Never Left Us is mostdefinitely not a compendium of my previous works. In only very few sections do Ihave to cross-refer to my previous books, but only so that the reader is notleft hanging.That extraterrestrials visited Earth millennia ago and influenced our forebearscan be proved. But—and this is the ultimate test of our knowledge—ETs are stillat work today. And that concerns us all. Why do they do what they do? What doesan extraterrestrial species gain from observing us rather like we observe ants?What have the aliens actually wanted in the millennia to the present day? Can’tthey leave us in peace? And why do we make it so difficult for ourselves toaccept the existence of extraterrestrials?That is what this book is about. To create the right mood for the main subject,I will start with a strange short story. The following science fiction story maydemonstrate how extra-terrestrials influenced humanity since their existence.Very warmly yours,Erich von Däniken"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1THE GODS NEVER LEFT US“Apparitions don’t exist!” Roger Favre growled defiantly. He refused tenaciouslyto accept the impossible when quite obviously something strange was going on.Something was no longer quite right. Was his mind playing games with him? Hiseyes? The first signs of Alzheimer’s? Were the usual complaints beginning toaffect his 70-year-old body? Roger no longer felt quite sure of himself, but wasunwilling to discuss it with anybody. Perhaps a bit less alcohol? Stop smoking?Or should he do what all the know-it-alls were recommending: more exercise? Andgive himself a heart attack?Roger Favre sat in the same armchair in which he had been watching televisionfor years. It was heavy, made of dark leather, with a slight bulge to supporthis neck and wide armrests on both sides. Roger smoked, skimmed through thedaily paper, and waited for Madelaine to call him when dinner was ready. This iswhat had happened every evening since his retirement and nothing seemed capableof shaking this routine until, well, until something was no longer quite right.Until these strange lights started appearing.Among his acquaintances, Roger was seen as an even-tempered kind of person. Somecalled him boring, others humorless, but all valued his knowledge of hissubject. Roger had worked for decades as a geometry teacher in the town’s highschool. In French-speaking areas, high school teachers were called “professor.”Monsieur le Professeur. If there were questions about measurements or volume,and that happened frequently in the city of Geneva, his former students werehappy to consult him. Roger had a 46-year-old son who worked for the last 14years as a physicist at the Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléair (CERN).This son had the same first name as his father. That is why Roger’s wife calledhim “mon petit Roger.” My little Roger. Roger senior had become a triplegrandfather through Roger junior. The family had done well, and he should havebeen able to enjoy his existence as a pensioner without any worries. If onlythere hadn’t been the fluttering and intrusive lights that materialized atirregular intervals at foot-level by his television armchair. Roger’s wife’sname was Madelaine, but he called her “Didi,” his term of endearment, becauseMadelaine, so he thought, made her sound like a maid and a servant. And everyfew years, Roger fell prey to some whim. Madelaine called it “his obsessions.”They came and went like the seasons or the sudden urges of pregnant woman for aparticular food. On one occasion, he had planted 30 palm shoots in his garden ina fit of enthusiasm so that it would make him feel as if he were in the SouthPacific. The unexpectedly freezing winter turned his South Pacific into Alaska.Another time, he held forth that every responsible paterfamilias had to ensurethat he had a power generator in the house. He acquired a diesel engine and dugan illegal pit in the cellar, which he sealed with asphalt. When the powerfailed in the whole district, the police moved in. His tank was against the law,they yelled, and was polluting the ground water. It had to be pumped outimmediately. The whole house stank of diesel for weeks. Another episode worthmentioning was the one with the tunnel. He needed an escape tunnel to savehimself and his loved ones below ground in the event of a disaster, Rogerasserted with a deadly serious face. He dug valiantly with crowbars, pickaxes,and shovels for 12 weeks and even employed helpers whom he remuneratedgenerously for their silence. Then the groundwater came flooding into thecellar. Not all of a sudden, but rising day after day. Ever since then, Didi haddismissively called the cellar “Loch Ness.”People thought of Roger as kind and helpful, just a bit eccentric. Sometimes.And now the business with the odd lights on the floor. Was he beginning totallyto lose the plot?For two weeks, there had been these strange goings-on. Roger had bought thedaily paper at the kiosk, drank a couple of beers in the Bar du Léman, and whenhe got home, greeted Didi in the kitchen. Like every evening, he had thrownhimself into his ancient leather armchair and waited for Didi’s call to dinner.As he was leafing through the paper, he was suddenly irritated by a flickeringlight by his left foot. It was probably some reflection from outside, and thenit disappeared as quickly as it had come.Then it reappeared. Twice. Three times. Where did the light come from? Rogerwent to the window, his eyes searched the street up and down for a carheadlight, a reflective piece of material, children playing with flashlights,anything that had not been there on previous evenings. He registered no changes;furthermore, it was the middle of March and the sun had sunk below the horizon.Irritated, Roger returned to his armchair. Was he seeing things that did notexist? Was it his brain? Were his eyes playing tricks on him? He stared at hisshoes. At that moment, it happened again. A knot of colors formed above the tipof his left foot and arranged itself into a rectangle. Roger pulled his shoeaway; the colors remained, floating about 30 centimeters above the floor. Rogerpushed his shoe back into them. The rectangle of light remained unchanged. Rogerwent to the wall and turned up all the light switches. The lights in the livingroom shone brightly. Roger knelt down and felt the carpet, pushing with bothhands. The funny light had meanwhile collapsed, just like when a screen isswitched off.Roger went to the kitchen and asked Didi for a flashlight. Didi always knewwhere everything was. “Are you looking for something in Loch Ness?” she askedmischievously. “Nonsense,” he lied, “I dropped a tablet on the floor.” Rogerexamined the walls with a flashlight centimeter by centimeter. Somewhere therehad to be something reflective. A microscopic piece of glass? A small glassmarble? A picture frame? The metal wrist strap of a watch? A key? A shiny caseof some kind? A coin? A disk? Was he going mad? “Keep calm,” he said to reassurehimself. “I’ll solve this problem with scientific rigor.”After dinner, he was back in his ancient leather armchair. Roger was actuallyhoping that the apparition would return. Someone on television was justexplaining that the “world wide web” owed its origins to CERN. A certainMonsieur Tim Berners-Lee had developed the “www” in 1989 as a by-product so thatscientists could quickly share their research results. Roger thought aboutphoning Roger junior to tell him about the ghosts in his house. But Roger neededevidence if he was to impress his physicist son. Something concrete. But therewasn’t anything. The advertising had come up on the television. Some company waspresenting its latest camera. Camera? Roger went to see Didi. She was sitting inthe next room laughing about some daft comedy series.“Didi,” Roger interrupted her, “do you know where my old photographic equipmentis? You know, the black Nikon bags?”Didi turned down the volume. “What do you want in the middle of the night withyour cameras? Everything is digital today. You can’t even find the films forthem anymore.”“Does that mean you got rid of them?”“I wanted to some years ago. But then I hung the little case in the closet atthe top of the stairs. The stairs to Loch Ness.”“Thank you,” Roger exclaimed. “Perhaps we might be able to sell this oldequipment.”Two camera bodies with several lenses were lying in the bag. Exceptionalquality. Trigger, settings, self-timer, everything was working as well as ever.The only thing that was missing was film.The next day Roger went to the camera shop in the Rue du Mont-Blanc.“Tell me, Jean-Claude, do these old types of film still exist? They were calledKodak?”“We have them here. This is Geneva—you won’t believe the ancient cameras thatsome UN delegates still like to use.”The two of them sat down over a coffee in the back room. They had known oneanother since school. Roger wanted to know how a motion-activated camera works.How does a camera only take a picture when something moves?“You know these plugs, don’t you? They send out a weak beam and as soon assomething moves in the room the beam is broken and the signal is triggered. Thelight goes on.“Can such a system also be rigged up with a camera? I point the lens at acertain spot and set the self-timer. When the light in the room changes, is thepicture taken?”The next day Roger fixed his Nikon to a stool. It had been loaded with a highlysensitive 400 ASA film and connected up to the motion-sensitive plug. Puzzled,Didi enquired, “What obsession is this? We have neither cockroaches nor bugs inour living room.”“I want to find something out,” Roger spluttered, and that was indeed true. “Mycamera is connected to a motion detector which measures the light in the room.”“To what end?” Didi narrowed her eyes.“I sometimes have problems. Things appear too bright or too dark. Perhaps I needto go and see an optician. This setup here measures brightness.”Didi shook her head. Leave him be, she thought; this obsession will pass likeall the others.For two days, nothing happened. No apparition in the house. Whenever Roger satin his armchair, he unplugged the motion detector and disarmed the camera. Heplaced them on the chair next to him. It was maddening. No lights taunted him.Then, finally, on the evening of March 28, the flickering started again. Rogergrabbed the Nikon, put it to his eye, and pressed the shutter release 36 times.It was not possible to use the flash because it would have drowned out the lighton the floor. Three days later he held the color photos in his hands andrejoiced. Incredible! Unbelievable! The pictures clearly and unambiguouslyshowed a spot, which grew into a ball of lights. Then a cube formed and finallya colorful rectangle with stripes. While he was taking the photos, Roger hadbeen quick-thinking enough to push his shoe into the picture. It too wasrecognizable in three pictures in which the rectangle of light was positionedover the tip of the shoe.“Roger,” Roger asked his son on the phone, “can you spare a minute to see yourold dad?”“A bit difficult at the moment. We have more than 60 colleagues from all overthe world here. You can’t imagine the shop talk. And then there are swarms ofintrusive journalists.”“The papers are full of stuff about some elementary particle. What are youlooking for?”“The Higgs boson. Oh Dad! The story is too long to tell over the phone. Butyou’re quick on the uptake. In 1964, the British physicist Peter Higgs developeda theory according to which initially massless particles suddenly acquire massagainst the background of the so-called ‘Higgs field.’ These strange particlesexplain a whole lot, if we can find them.”“How far have you got?”“We first started up our particle accelerator last December, then again inFebruary of this year, and currently we are starting the third phase. It alllooks very promising. But don’t ask about the quantities of energy we need!Almost impossible for the man in the street to comprehend....”Roger senior knew that. The Large Electron-Positron Collider (LEP) had beenbrought on stream at CERN as long ago as 1989. When fully operational, thismonster gobbled up 100 GeV (gigaelectron volts), the energy used by 10 cities.Now the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) was running, the largest particleaccelerator in the world. Roger knew about it from the papers. The acceleratorring had a circumference of about 27 kilometers. It was located directly underthe French and Swiss border areas near Geneva, which was about 60 metersunderground only a few kilometers away from Roger’s house. In this ring—actuallya circular tube—9,300 gigantic magnets ensured that the elementary particles,which were accelerated to near the speed of light, did not crash into the wall,but kept to the middle of the tube at incredible speeds. CERN was financed by 21states and each participant sent their best physicists to Geneva. The publicrarely found out what was actually happening at CERN. Not for any reasons ofsecrecy, CERN was happy to communicate, but because of the complexity of thesubject. Particle physics was not popular and not something that could beexplained in a few words.“And when do you expect a breakthrough?” Roger senior enquired of Roger junior.“That’s not so easy to predict. Actually, we are hoping for something in thenext few weeks, but anything is possible: a revolution in particle physics or adisaster. You’ll hear about it on all channels if we have a successfulbreakthrough.”“Just one more quick question, son, before you go,” Roger said. “I’ve heard somestupid rumors. Is what you do actually dangerous? I read recently that somephysicists had warned that you could produce a mini black hole that couldswallow up the whole world. After all, the popular media often refer to thisHiggs thing as the ‘God particle.’”“Dad, you really don’t need to worry about anything. I and many other of mycolleagues know the calculations. Nowhere can a black hole come about. Thatwould require a million times the energy we have now. When all the fuss here isover, I look forward to coming home for a meal. Bye! Love to Mum! I’ll be intouch!”Roger put his cell phone aside and looked thoughtfully at his 36 color photos.He picked up one photo after the other. And his suspicion kept growing. Was therectangle of light in his living room connected with the experiments conductedwith the Large Hadron Collider? Was something uncanny manifesting in his housethat might be of burning interest to the physicists at CERN? Troubled, Rogerwanted to phone his son again but thought better of it. He needed more evidence,better photos. Pictures from another angle.So Roger obtained a batch of very fast Kodak film, everything Jean-Claude had instock. The living room turned into a hunting ground. Roger no longer sat in hisancient leather armchair, but propelled himself across the carpet on a smallchair with wheels he had acquired from a home for the elderly. He had his cameraround his neck as if he were out stalking. Both cameras were loaded, and he hadfour different lenses available.Didi became concerned. “Can you really not explain to me what all this is about?You’re behaving like normal, but I know your eyes and your impulses.”Roger took her to one side and attempted to explain to her something about theHiggs particle. He showed her the 36 pictures.Didi looked nervous. Uncertain, she said, “And there is nothing that willexplode? You don’t have any chemicals in the house?”“No, my darling. Not even a Bengal Match.”Didi stared at the floor, then back to the 36 pictures lying spread all over thesmall table.“We have to inform our son,” she said defiantly.“Already done!” Roger affirmed. “The physicists at CERN are all busy with thisextraordinary experiment. They are looking for the non-existent elementaryparticle. As soon as the flurry of activity is over, your little Roger will comefor dinner.”In the next two weeks, the rectangular light appeared at various times of theday. Roger took photos from all angles: from the front, both sides, the back,and from on top with and without the lights on in the room. What on Earth...? Itcouldn’t be a Higgs particle. As far as he knew, the particle disappeared asfast as it appeared. It decayed into other elementary particles—transformeditself. Roger had read up on it. As a result, he had learned that this Higgsboson corresponds to a quantum excitation of the Higgs field—whatever thatwas—at any rate, not something that remained stationary in the air and alloweditself to be photographed from all sides. But still: the light field existed.Roger could prove it as clear as day with 234 pictures. Roger junior would be infor a surprise. Full of excitement, Roger waited for the call from his son.May had come. Mild weather on Lake Geneva. The icy tips of the French Alpssparkled in the distance. On the southern slope of a hill 800 meters distantfrom the runway of Geneva airport sat two generations of the Favre family undera wide sun shade. Roger had cracked open the first bottle of champagne.“We’ve done it,” Roger junior reported proudly and nodded with a laugh. “Dad,none of this must get out. We’ve discovered the Higgs particle. Definitively andfor all eternity. It’s incredible. Old Peter Higgs was also there. He cried withhappiness; we all held hands and danced around in a circle. A unique moment!Twenty-six particle physicists behaving like children. But we decided only to gopublic with it in a few weeks. Our results have to be documented squeaky clean.So that journalist can also communicate them.”“Congratulations! You’re wonderful!” Didi raised her glass to her son. “Are weabout to become the parents of a Nobel Prize winner?”“Mum, you’re letting your imagination run away with you. We are a largeinternational team. The honor is due to Peter Higgs. He calculated the particlein advance.”The three of them fell silent. Roger turned to his son.“Do you have time to listen to an unusual story?”“From you, yes!” Roger junior laughed and raised his glass again.An hour later, he knew everything. He had looked through the photos again andagain. He had trekked with his Dad into the living room, had sat down in theancient leather armchair precisely at the moment that the apparition reappeared.Now Roger junior had become an eye-witness—an experience that embedded itself inhis brain cells in precisely the same way as the discovery of the Higgs boson.The men debated how to proceed. The physicist Roger said to the geometryprofessor Roger, “This is too crazy for me to get anywhere officially in CERN. Iknow two really good guys, both particle physicists like myself and both up fora joke. With your permission, Mum, Dad, I’ll invite them here. Saturdayperhaps?”The one physicist was a man called Zwicky from the Swiss canton of Glarus, andthe other, who looked like a gym teacher, was from Clermont-Ferrand in Franceand called Durand. They had a good sense of humor and started by telling jokesfrom the academic world.After the jokes, things turned serious. Roger told his colleagues about theevents in his Dad’s house. He showed them the pictures and, champagne glasses inhand, they all went into the living room where, as if by command, the coloredfield lit up. It had rarely been gone in the last few days and had, indeed,grown a little, rather like someone zooming in on an image. Mr. Zwicky andMonsieur Durand admired the colorful patterns from all sides. They wanted to besure that they were not seeing a reflection of some kind. They placed newspaperaround the light patterns so that any reflection, no matter from which angle,was impossible. Then the deliberations started. Theories, speculation, and madideas were discussed and discarded again. Mr. Zwicky said that he hadparticularly noticed the irregular colors. The thing was displaying a differentpattern from the front than the back. The back part was not a copy, not thefront side shining through. “Perhaps the whole thing is a hologram.Three-dimensions, and we’re only seeing two sides. Like the first and last pageof a book. But the part in between is missing.”The men decided to conducts some experiments. They would bring some highlysensitive detectors to try and detect the source, the origin of the light.Two days later, the living room was turning into a laboratory. Small boxes wereattached to metal racks bought in a DIY store. Lasers shone in a variety ofcolors from one rack to another. They touched the mysterious rectangle of light30 centimeters above the ground. The set-up of the experiment was changedseveral times. Four hours later, Monsieur Durand was exasperated and close togiving up. “That thing is not shining from anywhere. It does not have asource—somewhere behind the wall, on the ceiling or from outside. The colorimage is being created directly at the site where it is flickering right now.”The clearly brilliant Mr. Zwicky from Glarus thought they should try and findthe “message.” There was a message there, wherever it might come from, and thekey was to make it visible. The three physicists connected a laptop to severalof the devices. An invisible laser beam—this, too, was something Roger had notcome across before—scanned the very thin lines at the side of the square. Thelateral side of a piece of paper, as it were.Suddenly complete silence fell. Breathlessly, they all stared at the screen.Binary code began to form in five blocks:00110001 00110010 00110001 00110110 00110010 00110001 00110001 0011100000110001 00110010 00110010 00110010 00110010 00110001 00110001 0011100000110000 00110001 00110000 00111000 00110010 00110001 00110001 0011100100110000 00110001 00110001 00110100 00110010 00110001 00110001 0011100100110000 00110101 00110000 00110101 00110010 00110001 00110001 00111001“Where have these numbers come from?” Roger junior whispered in astonishment.“Or is someone winding us up? Are we in something like the TV program ‘HiddenCamera’?”“Shush!” Mr. Zwicky said, annoyed. “I’m just trying to make the code readable!Here—look!”1216211812222118010821190114211905052119All of them stared at the small laptop screen. Thoughtfully Mr. Zwickyexplained, “It makes sense: The first two lines of numbers end with “2118,” thenext three with “2119.” So they’re calendar dates written in the American style.That is, first the month, then the day, and finally the year. Here in Europewe’d write it like this:16 December 2118 (l2.l6.2118)22 December 21188 January 211914 January 21195 May 2119”“Yes and...? Who...?”“No idea.” Zwicky and Durand looked at one another perplexed. Then they allgathered around the table. The dates pointed to the future. Today’s date was May5, 2012. The first date on the screen was December 16, 2118, seven months and100 years in the future. What was going on here? Again and again the group ofmen checked whether they were not falling for an outright prank. Maybe theircolleagues from CERN thought something up to hoax them.The next idea came from Roger junior: “Is there any possibility of responding onthe same frequency? When someone sends me a message, I can send a response....”“In theory, yes,” said Durand pensively. “What should we tell the sender?”Mr. Zwicky had already started. He typed the date, “May 5, 2012,” on thekeyboard and followed it up with “Who are you?” He wrote all of this in Englishand in binary code because the group of physicists assumed that this was thelanguage everyone would understand.With these keystrokes darkness descended. Not just the screen on the laptop, butthe strange light box 30 centimeters above the floor as well. It seemed as iftheir message had arrived somewhere. Nothing further happened for the rest ofthe evening. Peter Zwicky—by now they were all on first-name terms—tried to senda further two messages. But the link had gone. Were they all caught in a commondream? Victims of unknown mind control? Reality seemed to have gone out thewindow. Objectively, Peter noted that everything was real and could turn out tobe important. It appeared that their unknown partners somewhere out there hadpossibilities at their disposal, which they were lacking.“And that means that there is no explanation other than that the strangers arecoming from the future. They’ll be back in contact—if they want to.”The group continued their discussions into the early hours of the morning.Roger, the geometry professor, insisted that nothing could come out of thefuture. Nothing whatsoever. And that included messages. Period. Jacques Durandreferred to the Swedish physicist Max Tegmark. In scientific journals, he hadpostulated parallel worlds, universes existing alongside ours without usnoticing. “Little Roger” referred to the work of the mathematician Kurt Goedel,who had said decades ago that Einstein’s general theory of relativity allowedfor tears in space and time. And messages? How was that supposed to work?“Imagine a very finely meshed net on a tennis racquet,” Zwicky explained. “Whenthe tennis ball hits the racquet it makes an indentation. The space becomescurved. Now imagine a tiny but extremely heavy ball in place of the tennis ball.It will curve the net to such an extent that it closes into a sphere whichcompletely surrounds the tiny ball. The microscopic but very heavy ball would bethe time machine. It could leave the sphere in any place. That, by the way,results from Einstein’s general theory of relativity—but you know that. Theincomprehensible part is that the time machine lands in a different dimensionwhen it leaves the sphere because there are an infinite number of dimensionsaround the space. Pictorially, there are a trillion other spaces next to thespace in which we happen to be at this moment only a fraction of ananomillimeter away from us.... Quantum physics makes the most impossible thingspossible.”“Mumbo jumbo as well?” someone asked.“Quantum physics is like mumbo jumbo,” Mr. Zwicky remarked calmly. “According tothe tachyon theory of our revered colleague Gerald Feinberg, cause and effectcan even be reversed....”As morning arrived, the men took a taxi home. The apparition did not returnuntil the day after.Peter had connected the laptop to the printer. A very clear 3D image glinted onthe screen. Everyone could recognize the slightly bent banana shape of LakeGeneva from above. And around it was the city of Geneva, only much bigger thanin 2012. An expanse of houses intersected by wide roads surrounded both sides ofthe lake. On the left, it extended as far as today’s Swiss city of Lausanne, onthe right side opposite, as far as the spa town of Evian in France. And abovethe picture there fluttered the unmistakable blue flag of the UN.“I don’t believe it!” Jacques remarked derisively. “Simply impossible! If thatimage comes from the future there would still have to be a UN in 106 years’ timeand its flag would also have remained the same as today. That can’t be!”“What could we ask them?” Peter Zwicky interjected thoughtfully. They agreed onthe sentence “Please identify yourselves.”The response came by return: “We are the descendants. We are experimenting withbridging. According to the old Christian calendar, today is May 7, 2119.”“Ha! Insane!” Peter scoffed ironically. They say they’re in 2119—just likethat!”“Slowly I’m beginning to believe in the impossible,” Roger remarked. “Just thinkof the benefit we can obtain from knowledge out of the future. They’re more thana hundred years ahead of us! Their knowledge will reduce the time needed for ourresearch....”“...and our research budgets...”Until then, the only proper smoker among the four physicists has been Rogersenior. Now everyone was puffing nervously on their cigarettes. It was clear toall of them: They had to inform their colleagues and bosses. The discovery ofthe “Higgs bosons” was small beer in comparison to a dialogue with the future.The consequences were unthinkable!Together they agreed to ask their partners in the future a question: “AlbertEinstein calculated gravitational waves and postulated that these waves wouldcause the curvature of space. Has this theory been proven?”There was no response. The connection was broken off from the other side. Thescreen remained dark. That is why neither Roger junior nor senior, neither PeterZwicky nor Jacques Durand, informed their colleagues. Peter said what all ofthem were thinking. No knowledge was allowed to reach the past from the future.It would change the future.The men agreed to give up the research laboratory in Roger’s living room anddismantle the devices, lasers, and racks in the living room. But then the screenlit up again. Eight people with faces of almost supernatural beauty revealedthemselves. Each one had the same large eyes, the same regular slightly smilinglips. Each one was wearing a kind of dark blue overall and each one waved withslow, graceful movements. On the lower edge of the screen the words appearedwith a mercurial luminescence: THE FUTURE HAPPENS REGARDLESS. Thinking quickly,Peter started the printer. The pictures appeared in color and with razorsharpness. After two minutes the connection terminated.The photocopies made by Roger Favre went through several hands. And the world nolonger made sense to the small number of initiates of 2012. Those were ourdescendants? All of them very beautiful? Graceful, gentle, no distinctionbetween the sexes? Furthermore, they emitted something alien. Our descendants,extraterrestrials?"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2CONTRADICTIONS?Just a few words by way of introduction:Many millennia ago, when our ancestors were living in the Stone Age, a giantmother spaceship was circling our planet. Smaller shuttles went down to Earth.The group of ETs acted like ethnologists. They studied some tribes, diligentlylearned the languages, gave human beings tips and instructions for a regulatedfuture, and finally took leave again with the promise to return in the fardistant future. This became the starting point for religions on Earth. Ourancestors had classed the strangers as “gods.”These thoughts are not speculation, no kind of hypothesis, or any other kind oftheory—they can be proven. Everyone who takes the trouble to study the materialreaches the same conclusion. Those who want to, know about it.The consequences of that prehistoric visit affect all of us: our religions,political systems, ideologies, what we are as “human beings,” and our present asmuch as our future. As an insider, as an “old hand” and author of 40 books onthe subject, I am just as familiar with the unanswered questions as the criticsare. For the latter, the contradictions appear obvious, problematic, andinsurmountable. For those in the know, everything has its compelling logic,including those things that appear to be impossible.Are there extraterrestrials at all? What do they look like? Why do they looklike human beings? What technology enabled them to bridge the light years? Whatdid they actually want here? Why, given the billions of available planets, didthey come just here to Earth? And why did they do so precisely at this point inthe course of earthly evolution? Why did they leave their home? What do the ETsgain from contact with us? Do they want to exploit us? Why don’t they killhumanity off? And why don’t they reveal themselves to the general public? Whyplay games of hide-and-seek?These are all justified questions. And to each one—without exception!—there is alogical answer. In the meantime, the ETs have started influencing human beingsagain. I contend that the extraterrestrials were not only here millennia ago,they are here again. They are now and have been for decades. Earth is beingobserved, studied, and analyzed, and there is contact between the ETs andindividual groups of people. Totally insane?“I am certain about this: sometimes totally unfamiliar objects pass soundlesslythrough our airspace, displaying flight characteristics which we cannot imitatewith the technical means at our disposal.”1 [notes.html#ch02note1]—Denis Letty, French Air Force Major General and recipient of the Order of theLegion of Honor“I was a first lieutenant at the Malmstrom air force base in Montana, U.S.A. on24 March 1967.

Itwasn’t an apparition but an enormous solid body whose distinctive leading edgewas lined with spotlights and which was crossing the skies across Arizona.

We mightnot like it; we might want to scream, curse, repress it, refuse to acknowledgeit, complain about it, whine, or let our jaw drop; we are no longer alone.Science and rational people will probably look for alternatives, for “logical”explanations in order to categorize the impossible. This is of no use; we are nolonger alone. Every one of the witnesses quoted above is a person aware of theirresponsibilities and each one knows why they said something.Why did these men do what they did? They want to protect humankind from a shock.They want to introduce the new findings gradually to society. And some of thesecourageous personalities know more than they are saying because they have haddialogue with the extraterrestrials and have asked them about their reasons.They wanted to know why the aliens have not assailed us despite their technicalsuperiority, why they did not reveal themselves over a sold-out football match,and why they have any understanding for us humans. After all, we don’t displayany understanding for a colony of ants.I do not intend to discuss (again!) the general question as to whether or notthere is extraterrestrial life at all. Every reasonable person knows we are notalone in the universe. Furthermore, it may be swarming with unimagined lifeforms, but also with life forms similar to humans. This idea arises from the“panspermia” theory of the Swedish Nobel Prize winner Svante Arrhenius(1859–1927). I have already written about it.12 [notes.html#ch02note12] AndEarth-like planets? Not too hot and not too cold? NASA calculates that there are4.5 billion such worlds in our Milky Way alone. (Extrapolations frommeasurements of the Kepler space telescope expand to 17 billion Earth-likeplanets.)What do the aliens want here? How do they know about our world at all? We aretheir scions. The gods created human beings in their image.Sudden, unannounced contact between ETs and our society would be a disasterprimarily for us, but possibly also for the aliens. A science author writingunder the pseudonym Claudio Stella says in this respect, “If the probableconsequences of contact are war between states, if it therefore leads to deathand destruction, there is a lot to be said for not establishing contact.”13[notes.html#ch02note13]Why should the ETs be bothered at all about what happens on Earth? What concernof theirs are wars between humans, human feelings, behavior, politics, andreligions? The counter-question is, what benefit would extraterrestrials havefrom a broken Earth, from billions of dead, from destroyed industries?The answer is our raw materials! Ha! An extraterrestrial species would not mineits minerals, ores, and gold on an inhabited planet. Raw materials are availablefor free, without war and death, on the uninhabited planets of every solarsystem, in ours, on the moon, Mars, and not to mention the asteroid belt betweenMars and Jupiter. There—on the mini planet Ceres, for example—the raw materialsare available in pure form. Robots can mine them without the presence ofdisruptive life forms, without horrible thunderclouds, and without payment. Whyshould ETs go in for a war on Earth, make themselves hated, and have to dealwith acts of sabotage even after a victory, when it can be done much moresimply? The extraterrestrials were never concerned with raw materials. Everysolar system is full of them.Why, then, is there no direct contact with us? Steady on. There are, in fact,connections with individual groups on Earth; I will get to that. But what isabsent is the global presence, the impressive, awe-inspiring public appearance.With whom should the ETs sit down? With the despot of an underdeveloped statewho only thinks of their own advantage and does not understand anything aboutscience and technology? With the corrupt rulers of developing countries? Whatwould be the benefit of such contact for the ETs? No contact, then, with fools,but with the leaders of a progressive, technological society. On Earth with theAmericans? The Russians? The French or Chinese? Every nation contacted wouldimmediately try to draw some benefit for itself from the information obtainedfrom the extraterrestrials. It would want to gain an advantage over the others.This is the breeding ground of jealousy about the technical superiority of theother and fear of possible subjugation. So should the extraterrestrials revealthemselves to all nations at the same time? Circle around the globe in hugespaceships and appear over golf courses and Olympic stadiums? Plug themselvesinto the global TV network?Our reaction would be terrible.The Pope would announce that the ETs were the Devil’s spawn, the Antichrist, andwe Christians must never listen to them. The aliens have come to exploit us, toenslave and destroy us, as had already been proclaimed by the Apostle John inhis Apocalypse. Things would be no better with the Grand Mufti in Islam or theChief Rabbi in Jerusalem. The visit of the extraterrestrials would cause all theprinces of the different religions to lose their power. A careless word from anET, for example, that God did not have a son or that there was no original sinand thus no reason for Christ to have died on the Cross, would transform thebelief in Christianity into a madhouse.An extraterrestrial explains in a TV interview that Mohammed, the founder ofIslam, did not write a single word of the Koran himself. He had been uneducatedand illiterate and all the verses of the Koran had been invented by scholars ata later time. As a consequence, millions of devout Muslims would be lost. A lifeof prayer, suffering, and hard work for a lie? Life would have lost its meaning.In Jerusalem, an extraterrestrial with a friendly smile explains to his Jewishinterviewer that the God of the Torah who spoke to Moses, who had descended tothe holy mountain in fire and brimstone, had only been an extraterrestrial, oneof their ancestors who had visited Earth thousands of years ago. Yahweh an ET? Areligion, exceptionally well sold for thousands of years, nothing butintellectual nonsense? Based on a misunderstanding of technically illiterateforebears? That cannot be serious! The God of the Old Testament anextraterrestrial? The Jewish community misled for over 5,000 years?In a debate with the participation of ETs, an anthropologist insists thatevolution was a secure part of the scientific worldview. But the ET on the panelexplains, “Evolution, yes—but there’s more. Earth never was a closed system. Ourforebears intervened in the human genome on several occasions.” For theDarwinists on Earth, and this really applies to the whole of the academic world,a scientifically well-founded building collapses. Are none of the things truethat we human beings have acquired through hard and thorough work? The physicistcomments that Albert Einstein had calculated as clear as daylight that nothingwas faster than the speed of light. Faster was impossible because when the speedof light is reached mass becomes infinite. But the amiable ET next to him withhis constant smile contradicts him with a gentle, resonant voice: “Einstein wasright, but only in your physical system. There are systems in which Einstein’sphysics no longer applies. How do you imagine we got here? With liquidpropellant rocket power?”As reasonable beings, centuries ahead of Earth technology, the ETs will notintervene in our lives without gentle preparation. Preparation? How?On October 13, 1917, the aliens demonstrated their presence before 75,000earthlings in the small Portuguese village of Fatima, disguised as a religiousapparition. At the time, they delivered a message addressed to the “highestrepresentative of the Earth” with the request to publish this message in 1960—43years after the show in the firmament. The message ended up in the Vatican. Allpopes to the present day have refused to make the content of the so-called“third secret of Fatima” accessible to the public, although the message wasactually supposed to come from the (alleged) Mother of God, who is likely toknow what she can expect of her highest religious representative on Earth.Subsequently false messages were published and falsehoods produced by Vaticancircles. I have scrupulously exposed the whole tissue of lies in my book TheGods Were Astronauts.14 [notes.html#ch02note14] Either way, visitors can stilladmire the marvelous stained-glass window depicting the so-called “Miracle ofthe Sun of Fatima” in the magnificent Basilica of Fatima. (See Image 1 of thecolor insert.)The popes refuse to make the message of Fatima publicly accessible. Period.Would it not be high time for the extraterrestrials to protest and intervene?Clearly that has not happened, not in 1960 nor later. Why not? Because the ETsknow our politics, our religions, our whole social system and, furthermore, donot have the slightest interest in throwing Earth into turmoil. That starts withsimple self-interest. A broken planet with millions of angry, disappointedpeople is of no use to them at all. So they continued to show patience withthese fractious beings and gentle preparation for the official contact. Thepopes, of course, know about this. Since 1960 (at the latest) each one of themknows the truth. Each one of them knows about that contact on October 13, 1917.And each one of them knows that the truth is inexorably approaching. Day forday, year for year. It comes as no surprise to me at all that His Holiness PopeJohn XXIII (1958–1963), who read the message of Fatima in 1960, died of griefand sorrow. The next pontiff, Pope John Paul V (1963–1978), traveled the worldand likely informed all the princes of the different religions about the ETs andthe inexorably approaching “Judgment Day of Knowledge.” And here it fits themold perfectly that the next pope, John Paul I, could no longer bear the untruthand went to pieces. Even before his election, the future pope had detaileddiscussions with the nun Lucia—the same Sister Lucia who was the former girl ofFatima. The pope’s brother, Edoardo Luciani, reported that after theconversation with Sister Lucia, his brother (the future pope) had been“completely devastated.15 [notes.html#ch02note15] He exercised his difficultoffice a mere 33 days. There was subsequently speculation that the pope had beenmurdered, presumably because he had found out about some corrupt dealings in theVatican’s banking business.16 [notes.html#ch02note16] And what if things werecompletely different? After all, the pope knew the truth about Fatima fromSister Lucia. He knew that it had not been the Mother of God who had beenrevealed there but an extraterrestrial. Did he discuss this fact with highdignitaries? Did he intend to publish it? Was this his death sentence? The factremains: John Paul I was in office a miserly 33 days. The next pope, John PaulII, exercised his office from 1978 to 2005. He is seen as the Apostle whotraveled the world. In each country that he visited he first kissed the ground.A symbolic act? Or did he want to symbolize that this land still belongs to usEarth citizens? Finally, there was Benedict XVI, the first German pope (inoffice from 2005 to 2013). On February 28, 2013, he retired from his office,which was a unique event in the 1,900-year history of the papacy. The highestChurch dignitary, the successor to the Throne of St. Peter, couldn’t be botheredanymore. Oh yes, their Holinesses know what is going on. And science?There is just a very small group that is in the know and it has undertaken notto go public. Why, for God’s sake? Why all this stupid secrecy?Imagine an individual astrophysicist was contacted by an extraterrestrialsomehow. What is the man supposed to do now? Call a scientific conference andinform his colleagues? They would declare him to be insane. And if he couldprove his contact? Perhaps through a gift from the ETs that convinces all thosepresent? Now the responsibility of the scientific community kicks in. Everyastrophysicist and every astronomer is a highly educated person. Each one ofthem knows our social system, knows about religion and politics. Each one canimagine the reaction of people. It is clear immediately to each one of thescientists present that humanity is not yet ready for this explosive message.They impose self-censorship on themselves. And this can be proved.Each year, a SETI conference takes place somewhere in the world under theauspices of the International Academy of Astronautics (the IAA). SETI stands for“Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.” As long ago as the 1989 SETIconference, the scientists involved decided to introduce self-censorship thatwould apply to all astronomers and astrophysicists: the “Declaration ofPrinciples Concerning Activities Following the Detection of ExtraterrestrialIntelligence.”17 [notes.html#ch02note17] This declaration sets out howscientists must act in the face of an extraterrestrial intelligence. 1. Any individual, public or private research institution, or governmental agency that believes it has detected a signal from or other evidence of extraterrestrial life (author’s italics) should seek to verify that the most plausible explanation for the evidence is the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence...before making any public announcement. 2. Prior to making any public announcement that evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence has been detected, the discoverer should promptly inform all other observers or research organizations that are parties to this declaration.... Parties to this declaration should not make any public announcement of this information. 3. Should credible evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence be discovered, an international committee of scientists and other experts should be established.Understood? Even a scientist, be they ever so high in their profession and,indeed, be able to present concrete evidence for their contact with an ET, maynot go public with it. First, everything has to wend its sluggish way throughthe commissions. There, the decision is taken as to whether people are ready foran extraterrestrial message. But what if a scientist goes off script? Doesn’tcare one jot about the declaration? They might call a press conference—and thatwould be end of them. Their own colleagues will stab them in the back. They willhave broken the supreme command: Thou shalt not go public. And the media willnot take what they say seriously. Just as they do not take seriously thestatements of the personalities quoted on pages 31-34.All nations with the technological capability engage in astronomy. They not onlyobserve the heavens but also search for signals from ETs. Whole forests ofparabolic antennas are pointed at the sky. Sensors have been fired into spaceand robots landed on the surface of Mars. As I am typing these lines, the spaceprobe DAWN is orbiting the planet Ceres in the asteroid belt and is supplyingsensational pictures. Pictures, by the way, that also show a mountain withstrange white and black stripes and a large rectangle on the ground. It couldnot be clearer that these are not natural phenomena. Astronomers are desperatelyseeking a natural explanation for them, but they might equally be traces ofmining. At some point, a group of ETs mined raw materials on Ceres. This thoughtis not allowed to be presented in public—at least not by any serious astronomer.And in general, these are very clever and thoroughly honest people. Should thehighly important, astronomical authority of this world be ambushed and told thatall its endeavors in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence had beensuperfluous? The billions spent on parabolic antennas, spacecraft, and robotshad been wasted taxpayers’ money? Its scientific research down the drain—becausethe ETs were already here? Here! In the solar system and even on Earth? Howshould a brilliant astrophysicist like Stephen Hawking, who is looking forextraterrestrial life together with the billionaire Yuri Milner, react? Hawkingand Milner started a hundred-million-dollar program in April 2016, to search forlife in space. A huge sum spent for no purpose? I can imagine that StephenHawking has no wish to know anything about UFOs or any ETs on Earth—until he iscontacted personally.Slowly even skeptics must realize that, not just the public in general, butscience as well, must be protected from the appearance of ETs. Science requirescensorship as much as the trusting mass of the people. How, then, to proceeddespite the evident facts? Claudio Stella, the thorough thinker about contactwith ETs, proposes a long preparatory period: “If the adjustment takes place ina distanced, critical, deliberate, and slow way, then there need be less fear ofa cultural shock extending as far as the loss of our own cultural orientationand the resulting terrible consequences....”18 [notes.html#ch02note18]According to his analysis, it would be wise on the part of the ETs to use apreparatory period in advance of the great event:Because such processes can take an irrational course, it may be advisable forthe ETs to prepare the earth mentally, culturally, politically, andorganizationally for their arrival through direct advance notification. Variousforms of advance notice could be used for such a careful, hardly shocking firstcontact. A technical artifact which can clearly be ascribed to anextraterrestrial civilization might appear, for example, to preparehumankind....19 [notes.html#ch02note19]We are in the middle of this preparatory process and very few citizens of theEarth have any inkling of it. Mental and cultural adjustment? For decades thescience-fiction films coming out of Hollywood have become ever moresophisticated, technically ever more perfect. Millions of people follow the StarWars series with huge enthusiasm. Since 2009, the History Channel has broadcastthe series Ancient Aliens. This show focuses on the visits of extraterrestrialsover the millennia. Originally there were to be five episodes; there are now150. Ancient Aliens has the highest viewing figures in the history of theHistory Channel.A political adjustment? How is this supposed to work on a planet on whichreligious wars are fought? On which dictators rule their countries and are notinterested in any modernization? Every despot, and be he ever so cunning,registers the technical changes in the world. TV programs are broadcast viasatellites. Travelers report on their experiences in other countries. TheInternet is flourishing everywhere. A country cannot be closed off. Even themost stupid of dictators wants to partake in modern achievements. Since theindustry in his own country is incapable of producing a refrigerator or cellphone, he has to acquire technical products from abroad, including arms. Theinvoices for his imported goods have to be settled with an internationalcurrency. His own national currency is of no interest whatsoever to anyonebecause nothing can be bought with it. The dictator has no alternative otherthan to fit in with international practices sooner or later. He will be takeninto the UN family and has to comply with the relevant agreements. Finally, UNrepresentatives visit his kingdom and citizens from his country travel abroad.If he continues to keep his state isolated, the homemade revolution becomesinevitable. The zeitgeist overcomes every dictatorship.Most industrialized nations foster democracy and their representatives nevertire of recommending this form of government to everyone else. However, apopular democracy as it is practiced in Switzerland, for example, is notfeasible internationally. In a democracy the majority wins and the minorityacquiesces to this dictate without dispute or, indeed, war. But this requires,before anything else, that all voters are rational. Reading and writing are theminimum requirements, and public education must have progressed to the levelthat the voting citizens can factually weigh up the pros and cons of a debate.Thanks to the media, the masses can be easily influenced. Does that meanclearing the way for the oligarchs? For the owners of these magical channels?Democracies have inbuilt rules to contain the power of the super-rich. Theserules work, more or less.What would happen if an ET allied themselves with a rich family and persuadedthese super capitalists to publicize an embassy of the extraterrestrials throughthe media controlled by the rich family? There might even be an arrangement. Therich person is given some unique technical know-how by the ET, which he couldpatent and manufacture in his industries, making the family even richer. Andwhat is the benefit for the ET?They have broken the rules that their species agreed with another group. Otherrich people—or also the military or states!—could attack the exposed oligarch,scorn his product, call him internationally to order. His freedom to travel andthat of his staff could be restricted, his accounts frozen, and so on. Thesuper-rich family would also have to fit in. It, more than others, knows theinternational conventions, and it too wants to be a respected member of humansociety. The ET would have no benefit from going it alone. Intergalactic rulesmight even apply in the universe, something like a “Milky Way UN,” whichprohibits individual ETs from taking up contact with individuals on anotherplanet. Perhaps the ET would risk being excluded from their community. Theycould be isolated and cut off from their technical bases.If everything is so complicated, with whom are the extraterrestrials supposed toestablish contact? Apparently their technological superiority may not be used—adestroyed planet is of no use to them and they can find raw materials for freein the solar system. An agreement may not be concluded with just a single nationbecause the nation concerned would immediately have an advantage over theothers. Single persons may not be given an advantage and, even if such a personreceived exclusive and valuable information, they would not be taken seriouslyby public opinion. With whom, for all the world, are the ETs supposed tocommunicate? Who is left?Intelligent people who have the competence to convene a body committed tosilence. Thanks to its awareness of its responsibility, such a group would besuitable for judging the consequences of a contact. Precisely, this variant iscurrently happening.The ETs are supposed to prepare humanity “mentally, culturally, politically andorganizationally”20 [notes.html#ch02note20] for their visit? But they have tostart somewhere. This has been happening since Fatima in 1917. For decades theyhave shown themselves intermittently. The earthlings called it UFOs. Reasonablepeople shrugged their shoulders and at best laughed about it. But the number ofoccasions grew. Stupid and clever books about UFOs were published, andintellectual giants and simple workers were among the people affected. The UFOliterature grew into millions. Then there were encounters of the third andfourth kind—ETs conversed with humans and even invited them into theirspaceships. There are authenticated reports about that.21[notes.html#ch02note21] This was followed by the kidnapping of individualpeople. Down-to-earth scientists cried indignantly, “Stop this nonsense!”“Intolerable!” But the nonsense only lasted until it was scientifically verifiedbecause the ETs had given some of their victims implants. They could besurgically removed and physically and chemically analyzed.22[notes.html#ch02note22], 23 [notes.html#ch02note23], 24 [notes.html#ch02note24]There was scientific verification at least for those who were seriouslyinterested in knowing. Year after year, ever bigger international UFOconferences were convened, attended by thousands including an increasing numberof scientists. For decades, I tended to see myself as an opponent of the UFOcommunity. Too much nonsense was being peddled. Then, after meeting somewonderful people, including some extraordinary personalities, I gradually had torevise my opinion. That is what I wrote in the first chapter of my last bookabout five UFO cases that definitively cannot be proved wrong. I knew all theeye-witnesses personally.25 [notes.html#ch02note25] And when someone has delvedso deeply into the subject, has taken the opposing arguments of the skepticsinto account, then someone like me can no longer keep silent. We are called uponto show the courage of our convictions.But how, in what form, did the first extraterrestrials contact individualscientists? Did they appear to them like angels in a dream? Storm into theirbedrooms at night like goblins? Did they disguise themselves as speaking dogs orclever parrots?After the ETs had quietly and secretly kidnapped individual earthlings, samplesof sperm and ovum were taken from them.26 [notes.html#ch02note26] Humanextraterrestrials were created. That is the people about whom Canada’sex-defense minister said, “Some of the extraterrestrials look like us and couldwalk down the street without anyone noticing.”27 [notes.html#ch02note27] Thecomprehensive knowledge of these “ambassadors” impressed every scientist who hadbeen contacted to such an extent that they—to use a colloquial expression—couldhave been knocked over with a feather. These brilliant people who were takeninto the confidence of the aliens are aware of their responsibility towardhumanity. Inevitably secret groups formed; that is how it works in humansociety. And of course the group of people contacted wanted something in returnfrom the ETs. We simply cannot change our spots; the group accordingly tried tonegotiate. That might have gone something like this: We accept your presence,and we will protect your anonymity until the majority of people can digest theexistence of extraterrestrials without panicking. How about, in return, showingus some tiny aspect of your phenomenal technology? In a next step it iscontractually agreed that the acquired knowledge may only be used for thebenefit of humanity as a whole—an agreement that both parties must comply with.Earth people are aware of the terrible reaction of their fellow humans if theETs were to appear over sold-out football stadiums. The extraterrestrialsequally so and, furthermore, a destroyed planet and freaked-out humanity wouldbe of no use to them. In the worst case of a breach of the agreement, theextraterrestrials could still use the threat of their arms. So within a shortperiod of time, an earthly UFO has been built in a super-secret facility, whichcould just as well fly to the stars as its extraterrestrial model. How did Dr.Benjamin Robert Rich, the director of the Lockheed Skunk Works, in which thestealth bomber was developed, put it? “We already have the possibility of flyingto the stars.... Whatever you can imagine, we know how it works. We have thetechnology to bring ET home. No, it will not require a lifetime to do it. Weknow how it works. We could have the opportunity to fly to the stars.”28[notes.html#ch02note28] The U.S. astronaut Edgar Mitchell is of the sameopinion: “Not all UFOs are in fact extraterrestrial in origin. Some of them areour own development...but we are by no means at the technological level of thosewho visit us.”29 [notes.html#ch02note29]Why does every American government class dramatic UFO sightings, unmistakableover-flights of its own territory reported by pilots, as harmless? Is it simplywhat the skeptics claim? That no one, neither a U.S. defense secretary nor anyreasonable scientist takes the subject seriously? UFOs and everything associatedwith them are baloney, total nonsense, a figment of the imagination? And thepeople with their objective warnings are misled and should not be takenseriously? Sorry! The problem is the reverse. The skeptics and the “reasonablepeople” who want to stand with both feet on the ground are uninformed. They donot know what is going on. Every person, without exception, whom I quoted at thebeginning of this chapter, was originally a skeptic. None of them consideredUFOs to be an extraterrestrial reality before then. All of them stood on theground of alleged reason until they were initiated. And it requires effort toget to this information—it does not just drop into a person’s lap. After all, weare still dealing with well-guarded secrets intended to prevent humanity fromgoing mad. Meanwhile, however, UFOs have been recorded by all military systems.There is a wealth of outstanding radar and visual data, clear statements fromfighter pilots and air force generals internationally. And none of thesewitnesses are a sandwich short of a picnic; none of them are crackpots. None ofthem are irresponsible. Yet the U.S. government does not see the slightestdanger to national security?30 [notes.html#ch02note30] When, however, a foreignaircraft, which could be shot down immediately, crosses the U.S. border,national security is invoked without ado. There could not be a clearerindication of the existence of a secret agreement than the downright absurdlyindifferent behavior of the U.S. authorities with regard to UFOs. Woe betide anyRussian aircraft or foreign submarine violating American sovereign territory.All hell immediately breaks loose, including in the media. Yet UFOs do not existeven though hundreds of them have been documented and nailed down bothelectronically and visually.Because the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing, theauthorities tie themselves up in exquisite knots. The announcement is made thatUFOs do not exist, yet the U.S. Department of Transportation published a memofor pilots on February 9, 2012, titled “Section 8. Unidentified Flying Objects(UFO) Reports.” It tells pilots where they should report UFO sightings,specifically to “Bigelow Aerospace Advanced Space Studies (BAASS)” and providesa telephone number and email address.Long before that, the Ministry of Defense (MoD) informed its staff of thefollowing on June 24, 1965: “Our policy is to downplay the subject of UFOs andto avoid attaching undue attention or publicity to it.”31[notes.html#ch02note31]As long ago as 1953, when UFO sightings were slowly coming into fashion, theCIA, the U.S. secret service, issued the following guidelines in the RobertsonPanel Report:All authorities in the secret service network are encouraged to influence themass media for the purpose of debunking and infiltrate civilian UFO researchgroups...UFO reports should be made implausible and ridiculous...public interestin UFO events should be expressly undermined...and secret service agents shouldensure that the facts are withheld from leading researchers through targeteddisinformation.”32 [notes.html#ch02note32]There is no other word for this than “conspiracy.” By the authorities. Period.And the present shows how the instructions of the CIA were followed and carriedout worldwide. Anyone who wants to be taken seriously thinks UFOs are nonsense.Presumably, the ETs would prefer to negotiate with a world government that isresponsible for the whole of humanity. But such a body does not exist on Earth.(Although some groups are working hard to achieve it.) That leaves the UN. Inthis case, the discussion would have to be with UN delegates and at some pointthe UN General Assembly would have to be involved. That, presumably, is thelong-term goal. At the present time, however, pure suicide. ETs before the UNand the eggs would be broken. Total panic.The ETs could simply ignore our concerns and interfere when and where theywanted. They could impose their legal order on us and totally disregardparliaments and the UN. That would be dictatorship with the consequences alreadydiscussed. The same applies to a kind of protectorate. Claudio Stella considersit feasible that the Earth could become the protectorate of an intergalacticcommunity.33 [notes.html#ch02note33] That would be impossible without thepolitical will of the Earth community (UN); it would ultimately be no differentto an ET dictatorship. But now the aliens want something from us (I will get tothat). The Earth, or we human beings, must possess something that is of interestto the others. With a dictatorship out of the running, that only leavesnegotiation. But negotiations do not work anywhere in the universe without alegal basis. The aliens know their law and we know ours, as do countries allaround the world. They all have laws of their own, but there is also thesuperior law of the world community. A consensus will have to be found.Ultimately, it will come down to human beings expecting a lot more from thealiens than the ETs expect from us.How does communication faster than the speed of light work? How aboutinterstellar space travel without our primitive liquid fuel rockets? How haveyou come to grips in your development with environmental problems? Energyproblems? How did the different races actually arise? How many species are thereout there? What was there before the Big Bang? What is God? How can we extremelyextend our life? Are there also criminals in your world? How do you deal withthem? Do you use transportation to move about? How does it work? And your socialsystem? Capitalism? Communism? Socialism? Democracy?

What kind of clothing do you wear? How is it made? What kind of metal orother alloys do you have? Where are they used? Are there wars in the universe?Why? Who against whom?Our curiosity is unending. At some point, we will be faced with the choice ofbeing galactically involved or subsisting as an underdeveloped planet, cut offfrom the rest of the Milky Way, possibly to self-destruction and a new start.Just think: A presence of the ETs visible to all citizens of Earth robs manyglobal players of their power. Religions, cardinals, popes, mullahs, chiefrabbis, and so on belong just as much to the losers as national governments.“Politicians must come to grips with the question of losing their power from oneday to the next if they have to hand over their power to a worldorganization.... The elites will lose their prerogatives,” writes ClaudioStella.34 [notes.html#ch02note34]Why? Won’t people simply adapt? If only. And irrespective of the leadingpolitical and financial groups, there are myriads of religious communities onEarth. The so-called “prophets,” the self-styled “Apostles” of Jesus, the“elect,” the saints, and, not to mention, the hypocrites, will never admit thatthey have for decades led their believers in a merry dance. The lay person hasno idea how many churches there are in total and that each one of them claims tobe the only true one. The following incomplete list of existing religiouscommunities should give us food for thought: * Church of Constantinople (Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople). * Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania (Archdiocese of Albania). * Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Alexandria and All Africa (Patriarchate of Alexandria). * Church of America (Archdiocese of America). * Church of Bulgaria (Patriarchate von Bulgaria; Bulgarian Orthodox Church). * Autocephalous Church of All Georgia (Patriarchate of Georgia; Georgian Apostolic Orthodox Church). * Autocephalous Orthodox Church of All Greece (Archdiocese of Greece; Greek Orthodox Church). * Autocephalous Orthodox Church of Jerusalem and All Palestine (Patriarchate of Jerusalem). * Autocephalous Orthodox Church of All Poland (Archdiocese of Poland; Polish Orthodox Church). * Autocephalous Orthodox Church of Antioch and All the East (Patriarchate von Antioch; Rum Orthodox Church). * Church of Romania (Patriarchate of Romania; Romanian Orthodox Church). * Church of Moscow and All Russia (Patriarchate of Moscow und All Russia; Russian Orthodox Church). * Church of Cyprus (Archdiocese of Cyprus; Cypriot Orthodox Church). * Macedonian Orthodox Church. * Orthodox Church of Bessarabia. * Montenegrin Orthodox Church. * Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church. * Turkish Orthodox Patriarchate. * French Orthodox Church. * Abkhazian Orthodox Church. * Croatian Orthodox Church. * Moldovan Orthodox Church. * Belarusian Orthodox Church. * Pomorian Old Orthodox Church. * Orthodox Old Rite Church. * Russian Orthodox Old Rite Church. * Russian Old Orthodox Church. * Coptic Orthodox Church (Egypt). * British Orthodox Church: This church, founded by Raymond Ferrete in 1866, calls upon the tradition of the Celtic Church existing until the Synod of Cashel of 1172. * Roman Catholic Church (also Catholic Church). * Philippine Independent Church or Aglipayan Church after its founder Gregorio Aglipay, independent of the Roman Catholic Church since 1902. * Holy Cross Old Catholic Diocese of Minnesota (Bishop James Judd). * Old Catholic Diocese of Napa, until 2010 Old Catholic Church in California (Bishop Robert Fuentes). * Old Catholic Diocese of New England (Bishop Rosemary Ananis). * Old Catholic Diocese of Washington, D.C.

Then there is theworld community of Muslims with its respective subdivisions: Shi’ites, Sunnis,Wahhabites, Salafists, and so on. And each religious community is firmlyconvinced that it possesses the one “true” religion—the single, immutable truth,very often directly inspired by God or at least a Holy Spirit. For these people,it is simply incomprehensible that their faith is suddenly no longer correct.Millions of high priests, sect leaders, the “blessed,” the “illuminated,” orotherwise-inspired people would never be able to cope with the new facts. All ofthem will admonish their followers not to listen to the extraterrestrials underany circumstances, curse them, and fight them “in the name of God.”For how much longer will the ETs watch earthly egoism before they act? When willthey have had enough? When will their patience be exhausted, the limits of theirempathy be reached? Have they set a deadline for their scientific contactpersons on Earth? For so long we will leave you in peace, but there will come atime when enough is enough? And then? Will they simply disappear without a tracefor the next few thousand years or will there be the complete divine shock forhumanity? Which values are more important for the ETs?In the past, and I know quite a lot about this, the extraterrestrials neverrevealed themselves to huge crowds of people. They always showed themselves tobiblical figures such as Moses and his brother Aaron, the Patriarch Abraham,wise Solomon, or the Prophet Ezekiel in small groups, at least according to what“Holy Scripture” says. They did indeed subsequently take Enoch, latermisunderstood as a “prophet,” into their spaceship and instructed him inlanguage and science, but they did not cause a shock to any crowds. On the otherhand, they struck mercilessly, rampaged terribly if an experiment went wrong.Cities such as Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed with the same brutality as,ultimately, the whole of humanity through a deliberately caused flood.Deliberate? The Flood was not a natural event?Stories of the Flood are a universal fact in religions and myths. Be it theBible, the Sumerian Gilgamesh epic, the “Epic of Creation,” the “Enuma Elish” ofthe Babylonians, the Book of Mormon, the Kogi in Columbia, the Hopi in Arizona,the Maya in Central America, or the Dogon in Africa, a “God” always warns humanbeings of the Flood. All of them knew of the coming deluge far in advance. Andnot just only two weeks in advance like today’s weather forcast. The moment intime was set long before, the countdown has started. Without exception, alladherents were instructed to build a specific, watertight ship. Logically, noneof the gods acted “omnipotently,” none gave human beings a boat as a gift. Noneof the “heavenly beings” who had come down to Earth possessed the omnipotence toproduce a ship just like that in the blink of an eye or by snapping theirfingers. Every ship that was built required technology. Shipbuilding istechnology. And each of the pseudo gods described the coming Flood as apunishment. The human spawn of the time was meant to be destroyed. Clearly agenetic program had gone wrong. That, at least, is what many traditions say.According to the Book of Enoch, Chapter 106-13, “A great destruction will comeover the whole earth, a deluge...great punishment will come over the earth andthe earth will be cleaned of all dirt.... That is why I will bring a deluge tothe earth...”35 [notes.html#ch02note35]What decision will the ETs take today? In the past, they left us unmistakablesigns, enticed us to follow the trail. These signs do exist; those who want tohave recognized them.36 [notes.html#ch02note36], 37 [notes.html#ch02note37], 38[notes.html#ch02note38] Created thousands of years ago, they are neverthelessaddressed to a technologically and scientifically oriented society of the futurewhich had to stumble across them. Millions of enlightened Earth inhabitants havemeanwhile understood this. And, as planned, the message from the past haspromptly added up. But science, whose real task should actually be to furtherknowledge, indignantly turns its back. Nothing to do with me! It does not wantto acknowledge that it was deliberately led astray. And afterward it isdifficult to admit to having been used as a “useful idiot.” In psychology, it iscalled repression. And the media, always concerned for its alleged integrity, isnot allowed to report objectively about something that millions of people areconcerned with. We have created a two-class society. A small group of people inthe know is opposed by a mighty majority of those who don’t know and do not wantto know in their lovely idyllic world. But for how much longer?Does every intelligent species out there actually have to engage in spacetravel? Do they have to do it because it is dictated by their insatiablecuriosity? Because they need raw materials? Because their home planet, theirhome sun is exploding, burning up? Because their galaxy is being swallowed up bya black hole? Or is colliding with another galaxy? That is also relevant for us.According to NASA calculations, the so-called “Smith’s Cloud” will collide withour Milky Way in 30 million years. There will be gigantic fireworks of destroyedcelestial bodies, and two million new stars will be created. The Smith’s Cloudconsists primarily of hydrogen gas, currently still about 8,000 light yearsdistant from the Earth. But it is approaching us at a speed of 240 kilometersper second. If our astronomers are able to calculate what will happen in 30million years, then extraterrestrial astrophysicists can do the same. They, too,will know how long before they crash and will seek out new habitats before then.Space travel is a must for every society. Others think differently.In a lengthier article in the specialist journal IBIS, astronomer William Hoesekargues that ETs wouldn’t engage in space travel.39 [notes.html#ch02note39] Howso? Hoesek argues that the raw materials on every planet will run out at somepoint. But people are made such that they do not plan for the long term—meaningfor centuries and longer. Be it the state or private companies, neither investswith centuries in mind because they need short-term results for theirshareholders or voters. If humans were to send a spaceship on the search for rawmaterials, the people left at home would have no idea whether the crew of thespaceship had been successful or would return empty-handed. And no human societywould spend perhaps a billion dollars on such an uncertain venture. People livefor the short term and want to see quick results. Furthermore, the constructionof a gigantic generational spaceship would not only swallow up vast amounts ofmoney but also raw materials—precisely those materials that are becoming scarceon the home planet. Logically, such valuable raw materials could not besquandered on an immensely expensive space adventure, the results of which—ifany—would not become apparent for centuries. The same “earthly” logic alsoapplies, William Hoesek says, to extrasolar civilizations. The results of hisanalysis are correspondingly sobering: 1. In order to obtain help from another civilization, we would have to know “the others” and at least be in radio contact with them. 2. The civilization on that distant planet would have to be more technically advanced than us. 3. That civilization would have to be in a position to receive and understand our messages. 4. It would have to make available the raw materials we seek. 5. It would have to be willing to share its technology and raw materials with us. 6. We would have to be capable of understanding its tools and instructions. 7. The ETs out there would also know that their raw materials would be exhausted at some point. Hence they would be unlikely to give raw materials to other civilizations.40 [notes.html#ch02note40]That might all make sense from an economic perspective; it is, nevertheless,incorrect. After all, no gigantic spaceship is needed to seek and mine rawmaterials in space. We never have to go to far distant locations. We have massesof raw materials in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Distant suns,too, are orbited by more than one planet and meteorites fly through all ofspace. Neither are generational spaceships required to discover the geologicalcomposition of distant planets. Thanks to spectral analysis, we can already dothat with our super telescopes. Furthermore, innumerable probes can be sent outthat radio back their findings to the home planet. Then, earthly lifespansshould never be transposed to alien civilizations. The space-traveling ETs willknow ways to extend life. Finally, space travel at interstellar distances willnot be undertaken with our outdated liquid propellant rockets in any case. Quitedifferent possibilities will exist in the future—and thus different times. Dr.Hoesek’s views are based on false assumptions.The ETs have left traces in the past. Lots of them. They are described inancient sacred writings as well as in the landscape. The completely straightlines that have been inscribed across the earth for thousands of years were notcreated by our Stone Age forebears because they had nothing better to do, butthey followed orders from the ETs only to establish their sacred sites inspecific locations.41 [notes.html#ch02note41] The stone circles of Stonehenge donot happen to indicate the distances between the planets of our solar system.Their astronomical teachers were those “gods.” Similarly, the columns of menhirsin Brittany, France, which always reveal the same distances or precisely halfthereof, and which are full of Pythagorean triangles, are not inspired by anywhim of nature. Our Stone Age blokes received their geometrical orders directlyfrom the ETs. Long before Pythagoras.And today? We human beings should be prepared for a peaceful arrival of theextraterrestrials. Where are the signs, other than Fatima, the UFOs, films,books, and TV series? They lie in the open landscape, yet our blind intellectualworld, including the “rational” media, has long since managed to ridicule thesesigns, to discredit everything.Crop circles? Every Tom, Dick, and Harry knows about the fakes! After all, thethoroughly earthly artists are revealed in magazines and on television. Clearlyrecognizable, they demonstrate their skill in creating magnificent pictures inthe landscape. What else is there to be said about it? Why waste time and moneyto confirm simple fakes?The whole weird business started in Australia in the area surrounding Tully inQueensland. In the autumn of 1966, farmer George Pedley discovered six circlesin a corn field. They were classed as the product of small tornadoes. Othersdescribed them as a “UFO nest.” Then the phenomenon began to spread like a virusto other countries: Canada, Italy, Mexico, the United States, and, of course,the country where there has always been weird events, England. Reasonable andunreasonable theories were advanced. They were the tracks of tornadoes, ofrutting pigs or other animals. Ants or termites were responsible for the circlesand, in general, they were damage from hail. Next on the list were unknown forcefields active below the surface of the earth. I read somewhere that certainanimals would run in circles when in heat, and I also read about the assumptionthat the riddle could be explained quite reasonably through mushrooms. Then itwas the turn of hot air balloons, which had gone down in impossible locations,and of course we must not forget the footpads of UFOs. The next theory tookrecourse to solar wind as a solution or lightning strikes with an electricaldischarge to subterranean water courses. Moles or a collection of worms weremade responsible, and high frequency signals were supposedly at fault for thesymbols in the fields. The physicist Dr. Terence Maeden (University of Oxfordand Dalhousie University Halifax, Canada) connected these impossible events with“atmospheric physics,” “plasma vortices,” and “electromagnetic fields.”42[notes.html#ch02note42]None of this was sufficient for profound thinkers because every explanation hadconvincing counter arguments. Did the world-famous psychologist C.G. Jung notwrite about strange lights and celestial phenomena that would appear as themessengers of great, collective changes in thinking?43 [notes.html#ch02note43]Even about “psychic forces” and “events which would be incomprehensible topeople?” Could it therefore be that these symbols “might have their origin inthe imagination of individuals or the imagination fed by collective dreams andvisions?”44 [notes.html#ch02note44] Or did the community of human beings notgenerate a “collective, cultural impulse which released sufficient energy tocause a wave of unusual events?”45 [notes.html#ch02note45]Over the years, all explanations, be they ever so reasonable and factual, fadedaway because the drawings on the ground simply refused to cooperate. Iforiginally the pictures appeared in grain fields, they now suddenly grew infields of barley, rapeseed, and even maize. If in the beginning they were simplecircles, increasing numbers of ellipses and wonderful, partially interlacedworks of art began to be created. The pictures are their own proof. None of thisfit any longer with ants, termites, mushrooms, worms, tornadoes, rutting beasts,lightning strikes, or plasma vortices. The pictures displayed intelligence, sofakers had to come to the rescue! Some wise guys were making fools of all of usand having a good laugh about the human ability to make things up. The first to“out” themselves were the British pensioners “Doug and Dave.” In front of thecamera, they stated that they had faked all the crop circles to make the subjectridiculous. Their revelations soon turned out to be a huge bluff. Several mightyshapes appeared in various places where the busy pensioners could never havebeen. That included the picture of August 8, 2008, in Milk Hill, Wiltshire. Itconsists of 44 circles of various sizes, interlaced at the center with variousadditional representations. Or the geometrical shape of the “hypercube,” createdon July 17, 2010, in Fosbury Camp, Wiltshire. Here, there is not a singlecircle, but only symmetrical lines forming a massive hexagon with a cube in thecenter. When the busy pensioners Doug and Dave could not be held liable, otherfakers had to do.At some point (I can no longer remember when), a young man announced on a Germantelevision program that he and his group had faked all the symbols. Cockily hedrew attention to one detail that people had to be aware of: All the circles,lines, and so on always bordered on a tractor track or beaten path. A pure lie.Hundreds of circles and lines are not connected at any point with a track,however insignificant it might be. A picture like the so-called “magnetic fieldformation” not far from the Avebury stone circle is so complex that not even acompany of soldiers could have faked it overnight.On March 4, 2015, a complex formation appeared in a maize field near Icara,Santa Marta (Brazil); on January 4 of the same year, a group of interlinkingcircles appeared near Guadalajara, Mexico, also in a maize field. On May 8,2015, there were formations in Fangshan district near Beijing, China. From Juneto September of the same year, there were further extraordinary formations invarious locations in Italy.46 [notes.html#ch02note46] Even Germany, skepticalabout crop circles, marveled on July 16, 2015, about a shape in a grain field.It was near Fürstenfeldbruck in Bavaria. And, hard as it is to believe, apicture near Fürstenfeldbruck was even printed in the major German magazinesFocus and Spiegel—without a mocking commentary!Meanwhile, the riddle of the crop circles has spread to about 50 countries.Sophisticated teams of fakers must be at work worldwide. The logicalconclusion—or are we being deliberately misled, as with the UFOs? The editors ofthe 150part History Channel TV series Ancient Aliens wanted to find out. Theysent their clever commentator Giorgio Tsoukalos to England. He was to commissiontwo well-known fakers to make a copy of an already existing crop circle. So“Russel and John,” as the two were called, stuck their poles into the ground,laid out trails, fixed ropes, and seized their “stalk stompers.” (That is whatthe small boards are called which are used to flatten the grain.) The boardshave a rope attached to both ends. This rope is put over the shoulder and thenthe board is pressed down on the grain and lifted again by the rope for the nextstep.In fact, Russel and John managed to produce quite a reasonable copy of theoriginal within 210 minutes. Drones flew over both pictures. Only a fewdifferences could be discerned from the air. But what did a closer inspectionreveal?In the meantime, a team from the University of Michigan had started toinvestigate the phenomenon scientifically. The physicist Dr. Eltjo Haselhoffdemonstrated the differences between “real” and “fake” in front of the camera.The typical signs of a real crop circle are the following: the blossoms are notdamaged or broken, in contrast to the fake made with the “stalk stomper.” Thesame applies to the way the stalks are bent. With the “stomping method” they arebroken or at least lacerated. Not so with the mysterious shapes that did notinvolve any human activity. Curiously, all so-called “apical nodes” display anextension of 172 percent in comparison to the compressed stalks in the fakecircles. The second and third node on the stalk has veritably burst from theinside. This points to a short discharge of energy that must have occurred inthe stalk. Dr. Haselhoff demonstrated it in front of the camera: Various stalkswere taken from the crop circle and put under the microscope. The stalks in themiddle showed longer, burst nodes than those on the periphery of the circle.“The differences are like between a horse and an elephant,” the physicistexplained.47 [notes.html#ch02note47] The burst nodes are longest in the centerand grow smaller toward the outside. The stalks can be shown to have burstbecause of electromagnetic energy. It is the trigger of the phenomenon.48[notes.html#ch02note48] Giorgio Tsoukalos, the commentator of the TV program,said, “I find it strange and discouraging that a phenomenon like the cropcircles is not being investigated in depth by science. The circles are dismissedfrom the beginning as fakes although there is undeniable evidence that they aregenuine.”He is right. As long ago as 1990, a Centre for Crop Circle Studies was set up inEngland—where else?—to investigate the riddle in a squeaky clean scientific way.In the foreword to the book The Crop Circle Enigma, the archaeologist MichaelGreen wrote, “Meanwhile the phenomena are revealed to us in astonishingdiversity, in mighty proportions and in downright awe-inspiring beauty....Various strange circumstances accompany the appearance of the circles. Theyinclude, above all, high frequency signals which appear to be subject tospecific laws.”49 [notes.html#ch02note49] And Professor Archie Roy, honorarymember of the School of Physics and Astronomy of the University of Glasgow and anumber of other recognized astronomical institutes, speaks of an “immenseriddle” facing physics. The old gentleman knows his history of science. He says,“The whole history of scientific discovery consists of the outsider beingdeclared to be mad by the so-called specialist world—in order finally to triumphafter all the contempt and be elected a genius.”50 [notes.html#ch02note50]The TV program Ancient Aliens also showed irrefutable film clips that are quiteshocking. The observer sees white circles or spheres floating in the air above afield, including over a track, and a tractor driving along. Within seconds, anamazing picture is created under the shining spheres. As if on command, thestalks lie flat and form into a wonderful and complex work of art. The BritishCentre for Crop Circle Studies has meanwhile published such films and lets theevidence speak for itself.51 [notes.html#ch02note51] Thus, 145 of such circleswere created within 16 minutes near the Stone Age complex of Stonehenge. Andrecently, perfect microscopic balls made of a melted material have beendiscovered in these curious formations. The first were found by accident atMartinson Farm in Midala (Saskatchewan), Canada, after the earth had been siftedthere. Meanwhile, they have also been captured in sieves at other locations.Ralph Noyes, an ex-civil servant in the British air ministry, who later becamean under-secretary of state, noted a development in the riddle of thesepictures: It is no longer correct to refer to crop circles.52[notes.html#ch02note52] The depictions are growing in size, diversity, andcomplexity. If in the 1970s and 1980s they were still circles with a diameter of10 to 20 meters, today’s formations extend for hundreds of meters and oftenconsist of more than a hundred individual parts, which combine into an awesomelybeautiful “pictogram.” (See Images 2–10 in the color insert.) Fakers, and bethey ever so sophisticated, can no longer keep up. Neither could a company ofsoldiers of the British Army. Sites at which pictures appeared in previous yearsare kept under observation with automatic cameras. Groups of volunteers supportthe nightly checks. The wise guys are out of the picture, even if there is stillthe occasional stray one. On the other hand, researchers with a scientificbackground are growing increasingly baffled and are searching for a commonfactor. John Mitchell says, “The impression is growing that there is a specificreference to something.”53 [notes.html#ch02note53] But what? What is theintention of the “circle builders”? The Master of Science and former astronomerat the Royal Greenwich Observatory, George Wingfield, asserts that we aredealing with some kind of non-human intelligence. “The messages speak of anextension of human consciousness.”54 [notes.html#ch02note54] The archaeologistMichael Green said, “I am convinced that the source is intelligent in nature andthat they are gradually revealing their ideas in accordance with a plan.”55[notes.html#ch02note55] Meanwhile, Terry Wilson from England has published aremarkable story about the crop circles. The phenomenon is documented worldwidewith precise dates and locations, and it is also shown that strange formationswere already documented in the 16th and 17th centuries.56[notes.html#ch02note56]Who is this intelligence supposed to be? Does this “unknown” power have no otherpossibility than to make itself noticed through “pictures in the fields”? Whynot direct communication through our media? Why no awesomely beautiful picturesin the night sky? Or interference on our television screens that graduallyreveals itself as a pictogram? Counter question: Why don’t UFOs show themselvesover a sold-out football stadium even though that would be technically possible?I assume all these things would be possible but “the others” want it like thisright now. People are intended to marvel and talk, write and marvel. Slowly weare to be made aware of the other dimension without ambush, without violence,and without dictatorship, yet visible for everyone. Whereby other researchers(including myself) have noticed that many of the grandiose formations areemerging out of the ground near Stone Age complexes, such as Stonehenge, AveburyRing, Silbury Hill, or the “White Horse” at Uffington, all of them in England.(I heard that the same is true of pictograms in Australia and Mexico. And in theUnited States, the pictures are created near Indian burial mounds.) How is thepast connected with this?Our early history is more mysterious than how we learned it in school. There wewere told that our ancestors, only just descended from the apes, had vegetatedin caves, groomed the lice out of their fur, occasionally hunted a mammoth orother animal, and in general chewed on berries and roots. May well be. Butanother group of Stone Age families behaved in a highly intellectual way. Theirastronomical and geometrical achievements prove it. Furthermore, our diligentarchaeologists are moving the Stone Age architectural marvels ever further intothe past. Current dating is no longer correct.Around 18,400 years ago, the Mediterranean sea level lay 35 meters lower than itis today. This is shown by a cave system with painted walls that lies 35 metersbelow the water. It is situated at Cap Morgiou (east of Marseille, France).Ruins have meanwhile been found under water in all the world’s oceans.57[notes.html#ch02note57] The sea level has risen worldwide. If we thought thatthe first building phase of the stone circle of Stonehenge occurred in 2,800 BC,the complex is meanwhile (at least) 2,000 years older. The Great Pyramid inEgypt is the first planned high-rise building in antiquity, it used to be said,built in 2,500 BC. Yet the circular complex of Göbekli Tepe in Turkey is 8,000years older.58 [notes.html#ch02note58] The approximately 400 rock paintings inthe Chauvet Cave (near Vallon-Pont-d`Arc, France) were dated to about 20,000 BCafter their discovery. The latest C14 analyses produce a definitive age of37,000 years. And even in Germany, which, due to its recent history wants toavoid anything to do with nationalism, ever more prehistoric riddles areappearing that are all somehow connected with the starry sky. About 7,000 yearsago, there existed in what is today Lower Bavaria several circular complexeswith a diameter of between 50 and 180 meters. Without exception, they have anastronomical orientation and frequently several of these stone or wood circlesare lined up like pearls on a string. The same applies to Lower Austria, Poland,and Hungary.59 [notes.html#ch02note59], 60 [notes.html#ch02note60] The circularpalisade of Goseck in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, has a circumference of 75 meters,and like all the others, it is a so-called “sun temple.” That is, astronomical,and its age is at least 5,000 BC.61 [notes.html#ch02note61] Near Künzing inBavaria, the “Stone Age blokes” jammed 2,000 oak tree trunks into the ground.The same applies to innumerable dolmens and menhirs.Astronomy played a central role in the heads of the “stoneagers.” And we modernpeople only have super-clever answers as to the why. They were “light-pointerinstruments,” “playing fields,” and “secret locations for male rituals,” up toand including the most naïve of all answers: they had been calendars.62[notes.html#ch02note62] The Stone Age complexes show the intelligence of theirplanners. These clever architects will also have noticed in nature when thefirst insects appeared, when the buds opened, or the fruits ripened in theautumn. A small scratch on their cave wall was sufficient to register when thesun rose increasingly earlier or later. A wooden stick in the ground wassufficient to determine when the shadows were longest and shortest. Determiningthe equinox did not need a gigantic calendar complex. Dragging monolithsweighing several tons about and grinding them down to build a calendar was asnecessary as a hole in the head. Furthermore, the command from the high priest,“Spring has come, the seed needs to be sown” would have been no use whatsoeverif winter in the relevant year lasted longer than normal and there was anothersnowfall in the middle of April. It is time to think of something smarter thandifferent versions of a calendar.Our ancestors followed their celestial cult for one reason alone: because of thegods. It was the gods who had descended from the heavens, their lights moved inthe night sky, and their disciples had instructed human beings in various fieldsof knowledge. Our Stone Age artists were meant to build astronomically alignedbuildings. Their descendants—us!—should take notice, become puzzled, and seekcauses. That is precisely what is happening now. We have no alternative becausethe creature in our heads causing us disquiet has a name: curiosity. Nointelligence in the universe can do anything about curiosity—otherwise it wouldnot be intelligence. So who are these beings racing about in UFOs who havecaused magnificent art works to be created in the landscape? And who couldclearly destroy us at any time, and did so in the past, but today observe themadness on planet Earth pretty dispassionately? Who are these types whomanipulated us thousands of years ago and who even today give us a demonstrationof technologies which can, for example, quite simply disable intercontinentalmissiles with nuclear warheads? That happened on March 24, 1967, at the site ofthe Oscar Flight Launch Control Facility in Montana.63 [notes.html#ch02note63]None of the launch-ready missiles could be prepared for launch any longer. Andthis happened although each silo was located more than a kilometer from the nextand each one had an independent power supply. Who is playing with us? Why do wehave to put up with it? Are ETs really on Earth? Why could they do with us whatthey want—but are clearly refraining from doing so?"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3WHO ARE THEY? WHO ARE WE?Where does life on our planet come from? I understood it when I was in highschool. Life arose in the so-called “primordial soup” as proved by the famousexperiments of Stanley Miller (1930–2007) and Harold Urey (1893–1981). In 1953,Miller, still a student at the University of California in Berkeley, started anexperiment that had been suggested to him by his professor, Harold Urey. Millerand Urey introduced methane, water vapor, ammonia, carbon dioxide, and variousminerals that existed billions of years ago on Earth into a sterile glass flask.Electrical sparks were fired into the experiment, and a week later, the firstresults were evident. Organic compounds were created, as well as amino acids,all of them the building blocks of life. The period in which a nutrient solutionfor primitive life could form out of the primordial soup is set by science atabout 1.2 billion years. (A few million years either way are neither here northere.) The Miller experiments were repeated several times under differentconditions with varying results.1 [notes.html#ch03note1] It has generally beenassumed since Stanley Miller that life has arisen by itself, and all the more soas Stanley Miller received the backing of outstanding thinkers. The chemistJacques Monod, former director of research in cell biology at the PasteurInstitute in Paris, wrote, “The old bond has broken; human beings finally knowthat they are alone in the indifferent expanses of the universe from which theyemerged by accident.”2 [notes.html#ch03note2] And Professor Manfred Eigen,equally a Nobel Prize winner like his French colleague Jacques Monod, predictedas long ago as 1975, “It will be possible to reproduce every living creatureartificially out of its natural genetic material, that is by other than naturalmeans.”3 [notes.html#ch03note3] He was right. Today life forms are created by“non-natural means.” It is, however, done from the natural genetic material. Thephysicist Jeremy England goes even further. He is convinced that every group ofatoms would organize itself without external cause—that is, without lightning orelectromagnetic waves. That would turn life into a logical sequence of physicallaws. Coincidence would be out of the window and the universe should be teemingwith life, because all matter consists of “groups of atoms” and they organizethemselves, according to Jeremy England. Yet Jacques Monod contradicts thisfascinating thought. He postulated, after all, that human beings were “alone inthe expanses of the universe from which they emerged by accident.”4[notes.html#ch03note4]All in all, this is a picture that satisfied most scientists. It is the currentorthodox view, multiplied a million times and set in concrete in all textbooks.Yet it is controversial: Atoms combine to form molecules. But collections ofmolecules are not life that propagates. In the long chain of chemical evolutionthe cell is the first, simplest life form. For that to arise, all theingredients have to be present: amino acids, nucleic acids (formed from chainsof nucleotides), and the basic building blocks adenine, guanine, cytosine, andthymine. These form the famous double-stranded structure of DNA(deoxyribonucleic acid), the double helix, and so on. (I don’t want to bore myreaders by writing a chapter about the chemical building blocks.)The fact remains that in the first cell, which arose in the primordial soup, thecomplex molecular chain had to combine in the correctly matching way. A randomcollection of molecules, which happen to stick together, is not enough to form acell. Neither is it any help to make the reciprocal magnetic effects that happento exist on Earth responsible. A lock consists of a lock and a key. And the keyhas to fit into the lock. Only specific bases fit into the sequence of thedouble helix (DNA). Other basic building blocks cannot dock. And that raises thequestion: Why does it only work like this and not in any other way? Is thereanother program right from the beginning behind DNA or the innumerable otherbuilding blocks of life? Quite clearly they can only bond in a specific way.Specified by what or perhaps whom? Does something like “spirit in matter” exist,as the physicist Jean Charon put it?5 [notes.html#ch03note5] Does what happenson Earth happen in the same way on other earth-like planets? And on Jupiter-likeplanets a different program is running that in turn only works there?Chemical evolution, as I have just touched on it, is a firm part of ourscientific thinking. Yet science is something living. Ways of looking at thingsother than what happens to be the dominant diktat force us to ask new questions.And there are indeed a number of clouds on the horizon.The doubts already began to surface 44 years ago. At that time, themathematician James Coppedege asked himself what the probability was that thechains of molecules would dock in the right position. After all, nothinghappened in an orderly or, indeed, peaceful way in the primordial soup. It wasfizzing, burning, and boiling. Toxic vapors dissolved everything again thatmight have come together. Mr. Coppedege played the following game: Our alphabetconsists of 26 letters. If we wrote them on small cards, put them in a drum, andthoroughly mixed them up, the chance of fishing out the A would lie at 1:26. Theword evolution consists of nine letters in a specific order. The probability offishing these nine letters out of the drum in the correct sequence lies at1:5,429,503,678,976.Mr. Coppedege carried the game to extremes. He took the three words evolution isimpossible as the subject of his calculations. The words consist of 21 lettersand two spaces between the words. The chance of drawing the right letters in theright sequence out of the drum lies at 1:8,433,900,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.Now Mr. Coppedege proposed a machine that could draw a trillion letters out ofthe machine each second. In order to compose the words evolution is impossible,this utopian machine would have to rattle along for 26,000,000,000,000,000,000years.6 [notes.html#ch03note6]That is all nonsense, the critics replied. Chemical evolution was not governedby the principle of chance but by necessary forms. Jacques Monod’s chance andnecessity.7 [notes.html#ch03note7] Millions of molecules were swirling about inthe primordial soup and would have to find themselves precisely where lock andkey fitted together. This, in the opinion of the Nobel Prize winner JacquesMonod, happens of necessity. Today we say “without any alternative.” Yet thepermanent production of amino acids into enzymes and ultimately into proteinscontradicts not only one, but two concrete laws of physics: the law of massaction and the law of entropy. Immense quantities of water opposed themicroscopic amino acid particles. Here it should not be forgotten that aminoacids are not living things; they cannot reproduce like cells, for example. Nowthe smallest “living” unit consists of at least 239 protein molecules. But aprotein molecule itself is made up of 20 different amino acids and complexenzymes. To bring this confusing subject to a conclusion, the primordial soup,the “primordial atmosphere” in which this chemical game was played out, has noconnection whatsoever with our atmosphere we breathe today. That primordial soupconsisted primarily of methane and ammonia. Oxygen would have acted in thisatmosphere like poison. If the first cells had been created in a methane-ammoniaatmosphere, they would have been immediately killed off again by the addition ofoxygen. Furthermore, all reactions leading to the formation of proteins arereversible. Chemicals forming by chance can dissolve again just as quickly. Ithas been proposed that the proteins did not form in the chaos of the primordialsoup, but on the edges of craters: it was hot there; the proteins would havebeen destroyed.The technical debate about chemical evolution rages unabated.8[notes.html#ch03note8], 9 [notes.html#ch03note9], 10 [notes.html#ch03note10] Ihave only briefly indicated the contradictions. In 1973, Francis Crick andLeslie Orgel, co-discoverers of the double helix structure of DNA, published anexplosive article in the scientific journal Icarus entitled “DirectedPanspermia.”11 [notes.html#ch03note11] In it, they postulate that an unknownalien intelligence had ensured that life in the universe would arise everywhereaccording to the same blueprint. The aliens had sent out a spaceship withvarious microorganisms.A payload of 1,000 kg might be made up of 10 samples each containing 1016microorganisms, or 100 samples each of 1015 microorganisms. It would not benecessary to accelerate the spaceship to extremely high velocities, since itstime of arrival would not be important. The radius of our galaxy is about 105light years, so we could infect most planets in the galaxy within 108 yr bymeans of a spaceship traveling at only one-thousandth of the velocity of light.Several thousand stars are within a hundred light years of the Earth and couldbe reached within as little as a million years by a spaceship traveling at only60,000 mph, or within 10,000 yr if a speed of one-hundredth of that of lightwere possible.12 [notes.html#ch03note12]Crick and Orgel thus shift the origin of life to a distant world. But there thesame problems had to be overcome as with us. This problem preoccupied theSwedish physicist and Nobel Prize winner Savante Arrhenius (1859–1927) as longas 80 years ago. Somewhere, he writes, life must have started, and he postulatesthat life was eternal, thereby avoiding the question about its origin.13[notes.html#ch03note13] Of course, even a circular line had to start somewhere,but as soon as the circle was closed the question as to its beginning no longerarose. It could no longer be answered. Behind the start, some kind of“creation,” or what the religions describe as “God,” had to be assumed.Why can the start of the circle not have been the Earth? Because it simply doesnot work chronologically. This has been clearly shown by the astrophysicists SirFred Hoyle, the mathematics genius Chandra Wickramasinghe, and the Nobel Prizewinner Francis Crick. Their works are full of mathematical equations that alllead to the same conclusion: life did not arise on Earth because the time forits development with the myriad coincidences needed for the creation of themolecular chains was in no instance enough.14 [notes.html#ch03note14], 15[notes.html#ch03note15], 16 [notes.html#ch03note16], 17 [notes.html#ch03note17]In the summer of 1980, a scientific congress at the Hebrew University inJerusalem concerned itself with the question: Did Adam come from space?18[notes.html#ch03note18] This is Professor Wolmann on the subject:We know from chemical analyses that the fundamental building blocks of life arechemical compounds with monster molecules. Each of these molecules consists ofseveral hundred thousand to millions of atoms. We call these chemical substancespolymers.... We think that the basic substances from which nature created thefirst polymers did not come from earth but from space.These arguments should actually be enough: Life did not start with us. Onecompetent crown witness is still missing: Professor Bruno Vollmert (1920–2002).Vollmert was professor of molecular chemistry at the University of Karlsruhe. Heconcerned himself intensively both with chemical and Darwinian evolution. At theend of his many years of research, he admitted:DNA and thus life could not arise by itself...but since, on the other hand, lifehas always clearly been there, so that also pieces of DNA (genes) can beanalyzed and recreated at any time in the laboratory, it must either always haveexisted (which is not the case) or it owes its existence to intelligent,purposeful planning, is the result of planned design....19[notes.html#ch03note19]Vollmert displayed moral courage. He accused his colleagues of “ideologicalmotives” and slew them with precise calculations:The probability of realizing one of ten assumed intermediate stages, to be onthe safe side, of the growth curve of DNA through statistical copolymerizationon the path to a new class of living creature is 1:10 to the power of 4,000. Theonly honest interpretation of this probability is that Darwin’s theory of theorigin of species and life as such through mutation and selection was and is abig misapprehension.20 [notes.html#ch03note20]Chandra Wickramasinghe, holder of several doctorates, is currently the directorof the Buckingham Centre for Astrobiology of the University of Buckingham inEngland. He is considered to be a mathematical genius and has received honorsworldwide in the field of mathematics. At a congress in Sindelfingen town hallin the spring of 2015, he analyzed the impossibility of chemical evolution infront of an audience of 3,000 people.21 [notes.html#ch03note21] He told mepersonally at dinner, “You can forget the story with the primordial soup. It wasa good thought—but total nonsense.”With such an accumulation of scholarly statements, all of them made by topscientists, we have to ask ourselves: Why does the old doctrine still apply? Whyare students in high schools and universities not taught the two differentopinions? The motive is what it has always been: ideology. The one group deniesboth god and extraterrestrials. In its eyes, we human beings are the only onesin the universe. The faithful in all religions have been taught that we are thecrown of creation, students of science that we are the pinnacle of evolution. Inboth cases, be it religion or science, there is only one valid insight: we arethe greatest. A being like God has, in any case, been abolished for a long time.It never fit in with human self-importance.Chemical evolution did not take place on Earth. Period. The building blocks oflife came from outside. Who sent them? Are those legendary “forefathers” thesame who visited the Earth thousands of years ago? Or the descendants of those“forefathers”? The same who show themselves through UFOs? Who kidnap individualpeople and create marvelous pictures in the corn and wheat fields? And if it isthem, what is it all about? What do “they” get out of it? And what aboutDarwinian evolution? Darwin’s evolutionary theory is the credo of anthropology.In scientific circles, it is downright sacrilegious not to believe in it.Everyone who doubts Darwin’s theory is an ignorant bore who can be ignored. Yethardly a year passes without another press conference at which even more recentdiscoveries about the human race are announced. The fossil concerned is thendeemed to be the most recent prehistoric human being—until the next event ofthis kind.All life-forms develop from genes. What actually is such a gene? Professor BedaStadler, geneticist at the University of Bern, explains it:Genes can be described as precisely defined sections of DNA which represent theblueprint for RNA molecules from which proteins are created.... All genestogether are called the genome.... In higher living organisms, the genome existsin several strings which are packaged separately and are called chromosomes. Allchromosomes in turn are packaged in the cell nucleus. In human beings the wholeset of chromosomes in each nucleated cell consists of 46 chromosomes, whereby 23come from the mother and 23 from the father.22 [notes.html#ch03note22]Clear?The genetic code is the key to every life form. Anyone who knows this code canmanipulate any living creature as they like by changing the basic sequence inthe DNA spiral. The whole thing started in 1973, when the biologists StanleyCohen and Herbert Boyer succeeded for the first time in implanting a foreigngene into a bacterium. Today it is commonplace. Every geneticist knows how it isdone. At the time of our grandfathers, it was still “grafting”: certaincharacteristics of a plant are transferred to another one. Such things areeveryday occurrences for biologists and no one gets excited about them. Ingenetics, the procedure is different: The nucleus of a cell is stripped out, andthe chemical building blocks in the DNA string (the double helix) are moved toanother location in the string and reintroduced into the cell. But beforehandthe geneticist must know where he want to change what and what the result shouldbe. The cell nucleus can also be removed and implanted in the cell of anotherliving organism. That procedure is called “cloning” and is always done withcells of the same animal species. Dolly the sheep was created in this way in1997, a 100-percent copy of the donor animal. Dolly has long since given birthto healthy offspring. Then, in the spring of 2008, the British governmentpermitted the creation of hybrid creatures, so-called “chimeras.” Here thenucleus is taken from the cells of different living organisms, a cow and a humanbeing, for example, and the human cell nucleus injected into the empty cell ofthe cow. A short electrical impulse stimulates the cell to divide and the cowcell multiplies with the genetic information of the human being. Insane? Naturehas done this for millions of years. Without human intervention. A so-called“retrovirus” such as the AIDS virus penetrates a cell, copies its own geneticinformation, and multiplies. The Australian geneticist Andrew Pask from theUniversity of Melbourne implanted the genome of a Tasmanian tiger into a mouseembryo and got the cells to multiply.23 [notes.html#ch03note23] Similarexperiments are being undertaken worldwide. The aim is genetic modification,superficially the “improvement of human beings.” Defects such as Alzheimer’s ormultiple sclerosis are to be eradicated through such “therapeutic cloning.”As long ago as 1987, Japanese geneticists developed a so-called “supersequencer,” which daily decoded a million “letters” of DNA. That was just thebeginning. The U.S. geneticist Craig Venter wanted to reveal the “transparenthuman being,” that is, the complete human genome. He has meanwhile succeeded indoing so—with some complications. In his most recent bombshell, Craig Venterannounced that his scientific team had developed a miniature life form. In otherwords, a living “thing.” Made by human beings. Uncanny! The life form consistsof 531,560 letters of DNA and is designated “Syn3.0.” Although this syntheticthing is alive, Craig Venter does not know why, either.24[notes.html#ch03note24] More than 480 genes were implanted, others were removed.Until a few months ago (I write these words in the summer of 2016), suchartificial modifications to the human genome were considered to be a highlycomplex laboratory act. Swapping individual genes could take months and,furthermore, was very expensive. Meanwhile everything has become simple. KathyNiakan, geneticist at the London Francis Crick Institute, the Frenchmicrobiologists Emmanuelle Charpentier, and Jennifer Dudna developed a newmethod of modifying the genome with pinpoint accuracy. The procedure is calledCRISPR-CAS9 technique. What is almost like a molecular pair of scissors made ofthe protein CAS9 is used which, similar to a virus, cuts through the DNA stringat precisely the desired place.25 [notes.html#ch03note25] It is a surgicalprocedure on the genome—“genome editing.” “CRISPR works like child’s play,” theGerman news magazine Der Spiegel quotes the German geneticist Rudolf Jaenisch.26[notes.html#ch03note26]People who have no idea about what happens inside a cell rant about geneticallymodified food and warn with a wagging finger against everything connected withgenetics. They don’t know that the enzymes in quite ordinary washing powderswere cooked up in the genetic kitchen. Just like lecithin, which occurs inhundreds of foodstuffs. It comes from genetically modified soybeans. The sameapplies to the glucose syrup that is added to all kinds of drinks. To makeglucose syrup, an enzyme is required “which today comes almost exclusively fromgenetically modified organisms.”27 [notes.html#ch03note27]And now we have the CRISPR-CAS9 technique. With this genetic weapon, thetargeted control of evolution becomes a fact—any time, be it in the past or thefuture. Animals, humans, and anything else growing on Earth can be modifiedquickly and easily. Presumably the ETs have mastered not just the CRISPRprocedure but even more sophisticated methods of artificially mutating lifeforms. Did they do that? Can rifts or completely paradoxical modifications beshown in biological evolution that cannot be explained by natural means? WasCharles Darwin with his Origin of the Species28 [notes.html#ch03note28]fundamentally right—but not always? After all, he couldn’t at his time knowabout the genetic code, much less about artificial mutations.There are indeed living creatures on our blue planet whose existence raises hugequestions. For example, 4,000 meters down in the deep ocean where luminousmonsters developed in absolute darkness, including a creature called a pistolshrimp, which does away with its opponents using boiling hot water. Or theischnochiton, a primitive sea animal that has a carapace made of eightsuperimposed plates. On the upper plate there are hundreds of tiny eyes hiddenin small hollows. In this way, the animal can see everything in itssurroundings. Each tiny eye has its own sensory organ. A total contradiction toevolution. Even more fantastical, there are species of beetles with weapons thatcould not have arisen by natural means. One is of a very special kind: thebombardier beetle. They frighten or kill their enemies with a highly toxicsecretion that sprays out from a combustion chamber in the abdomen at around 100degrees Celsius. This secretion consists of the chemicals hydroquinone andhydrogen peroxide with the addition of the enzymes catalase and peroxidase. Acatalyst is created that mixes the chemicals into toxic benzoquinone (detonatinggas). This detonating gas explodes and sprays at its target out of the body ofthe bombardier beetle. It does so at a temperature of 100 degrees Celsius.29[notes.html#ch03note29], 30 [notes.html#ch03note30] In the whole process, thechemicals involved enter the combustion chamber through a very thin valve. Aftereach explosion, the chamber is closed with a flap, which opens again for thenext explosion. Two tiny reflectors—one on each side—enable the bombardierbeetle to shoot round corners. It kills not just small attackers but also toads,which are a hundred times bigger.How is this weapon in the body of the beetle supposed to have developed slowly?The wall of the combustion chamber consists of a resistant coating of proteinsand chitin. The toxic mixture shoots out of a controllable spray gland in theabdomen. The reflectors can guide the poisonous jet around corners. How are thechemical components supposed to have developed in the body, slowly fromgeneration to generation? Did the combustion chamber already exist or was itcreated later on? The controllable jet? The reflectors? Did everything developat the same time? Willy-nilly in a beetle family? And the combustion chamberwith its two valves? It must already have been present when the chemicaldeveloped—however that may have happened. Otherwise the beetle itself would haveexploded when the chemicals mixed. Evolution cut short. And the tiny flap thatopens rapidly before each deadly shot and immediately closes again? And thenthere is still the beetle’s brain. Coupled with its sensory organs, thechemicals have to be instructed to mix now, at lightning speed when an enemyappears. And the firing gland must be pointed at the opponent like a gun barrel.Then the command to fire.All a bit hard to swallow. Through which commands, which “spirit,” are theindividual parts of this weapon supposed to have come together? Did the beetletell its body, “I need a combustion chamber, a jet, a gun flap that opens andcloses at lightning speed? Two external reflectors made of very durablematerial?” After all, they not only have to stand the acids but also 100 degreetemperatures. A slow development extending over generations does not work here.Now I am not of the opinion that some “gods” somewhere had interfered with thebeetle genome and created the beetle’s weapons, but I think it is conceivablethat the beetle was imported from an alien world. Even if it was not in acompletely finished state, then at least its genome, similar to snakes or ratsthat get to remote islands on ships.The beetle is tiny, the whale huge. Every school student learns that whales aremammals and originally lived on the land. That also applies to other marinemammals. So at some point in its development, the original whale must haveplopped into the water. Perhaps it also waddled in unhurriedly because it becametoo hot outside. Then it loses its feet, forms flippers, mates under water, andalso suckles its young in the wet element. Where have the hydraulics of theextendable underwater nipples come from? They must have been there from thebeginning, otherwise the juvenile would have perished immediately after birth.And in general the question applies: If all of this was of benefit to the lifeform concerned—survival of the fittest—why did others of the same species not dothe same?There is no dispute: Mutation (changes) constantly takes place within a species.I read somewhere that there are said to be a thousand different species ofspiders. All of them are related to one another, and have a common spiderancestor. And the latter in turn has descended from I know not what miniaturemonster. But a spider will not turn into a cow, not after hundreds of millionsof years. The first vertebrates are said to have emerged from worm species. Andat some point a living clump of cells mutated into a crab. This now has to mateto continue the evolutionary chain. With whom should he mate? Did the randommutation that created the crab affect a whole horde? We mammals are said to haveoriginated from bony fish. The fish mutated and the swim bladder could no longerobtain oxygen from the water but from the air. The lung was born. From these“coelacanths” it was only a small step to the first amphibian. Great! And whatdid this amphibian get up to in its endless solitude? It developed into acrawler, a mammal, and so on. They now laid their eggs on dry land. At somepoint the first reptile developed, which could, however, no longer pair with itsrelative, the amphibians. New fellow creatures of the same species with the samenumber of chromosomes were required and they were—what a surprise!—suddenlyavailable.What is the origin of these changes? The genes are responsible, they are themost important data medium, “but they are only a small link in the complex andfascinating chains of life.”31 [notes.html#ch03note31] There is no dispute thatwe are the closest relatives to the apes. Until a few years ago, it was saidthat our genes were 99 percent identical with those of the great apes. We hadthe same ancestors, the same skeleton, and the same protein structure. In thenon-stop series of thousands and thousands of mutations over millions of years,quite a few things have changed from the ancestor of the apes to us—only theproteins haven’t. Comparatively, the differences between the protein forms oftwo frogs are 50 times greater than those between chimpanzees and humans.Professor Alan C. Wilson and his colleague Mary-Claire King, both biochemistsfrom the University of California who showed these divergences in the proteinsof frogs, say, “There must be a hitherto undiscovered and much more effectiveevolutionary motor than we know of so far.”32 [notes.html#ch03note32]Now Dr. Marie-Laure Yaspo from the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Geneticsin Berlin has informed the public that the differences between humans andchimpanzees were, after all, greater than thought. I quote:So far it has been assumed that humans and chimpanzees only differed slightly intheir genome. But now a team of scientists from Germany, China, Japan, Korea andTaiwan has discovered in a direct comparison of the chimpanzee chromosome 22 andits human equivalent, chromosome 21, that in the human genome there were almost68,000 insertions or deletions. [Author’s italics] While most of these changeshave no or only a slight influence on the function of the coded proteins, theresearchers nevertheless found in 20 percent of them significant structuraldifferences. If these differences are extrapolated to the whole genome, apes andhumans could differ in several thousand genes—which would better explain thedifferences between both species.33 [notes.html#ch03note33]The scientific findings are dynamite—and no one seems to notice. Theevolutionary distance between humans and mice is said to be 60 million years.Between chimpanzees and humans it is perhaps two or three million. Now, believeit or not, 68,000 longer differing segments were found in the genome betweenhumans and chimpanzees. “Yet this means that the amino acid sequence of the 231discovered coded proteins in humans and apes varies by 83 percent.”34[notes.html#ch03note34] (Author’s italics) Why, who, or what caused thisgigantic mutation? We are not talking about 50 or 100 random mutations in thegenome, but 68,000. They were not inserted or deleted at random bynature—whatever that may be. The differences are targeted.What are we? Fundamentally a product of evolution. But why are we so differentfrom our genetically related apes? The primate researcher Frans de Waal fromEmory University in Atlanta thinks that language differentiates us fundamentallyfrom the apes because human survival depends on it.35 [notes.html#ch03note35]According to this logic, we would not exist without language. No, say otherscientists. It was our social behavior that constituted our humanity, as if atroop of gorillas, a school of dolphins, or a pride of lions did not possess anysocial behavior.“We are bastards,” Professor David Reich from the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology in Cambridge tells us.36 [notes.html#ch03note36] The lines of humansand chimpanzees had already been divided the far side of Eden, then the twospecies had subsequently exchanged genes between one another again. “Afterpre-humans had already lived for hundreds of thousands of years as an ownspecies, they suddenly started engaging in sexual intercourse with theirknuckle-walking relatives again.”37 [notes.html#ch03note37]Nothing is impossible, but why would an upright, walking hominid suddenly spurna fellow member of his species and have sex with a fur-covered ape? Furthermore,the product of such love would be a genetically retrograde step. The bastardwould not have better genes, quite apart from the question as to whether thechromosomes of human and chimpanzee would be compatible in the first place.The heretical thoughts I put forward are not in principle directed againstevolution. We are quite simply offshoots of apes and all dumb cows are relatedto one another. A “primordial mother spider” probably exists somewhere and allinsects, the stinging and the harmless ones, are descended from a stickyconglomerate of cells. But I have good reason to reject the extraordinaryamalgamation of species with the inexpressibly complex changes of the molecularchain. Scholars such as the Nobel Prize winner Sir Francis Crick, theastrophysicist Chandra Wickramasinghe, or Bruno Vollmert, professor of molecularchemistry, are neither amateurs nor idiots. Professor Olivier Mühlemann,University of Bern, a brilliant representative of biochemistry, writes, “How didlife arise? Plausible answers to this question, which is of such key importancefor the way we see ourselves and our worldview, have been supplied in the last200 years above all by the sciences—with Charles Darwin leading the way with hissimple and elegant evolutionary theory which has been confirmed x-thousandfold.It explains coherently how today’s diversity of living creatures developed outof common, identical primordial cells.” (Author’s italics)38[notes.html#ch03note38] There is not the slightest doubt for the learnedprofessor, neither about chemical nor Darwinian evolution (...confirmedx-thousandfold...it explains coherently...).But why, then, does Professor Vollmert (and others) say the precise opposite?“(The cell)...owes its existence to intelligent, purposeful planning...Darwin’stheory about the origin of species...was and is a great misapprehension.”39[notes.html#ch03note39] (Author’s italics)All professors are upright, highly intelligent scholars and yet they reachcompletely different views. And this is multiplied a hundred times because thereare at least a hundred book titles by thoroughly honest scientists againstevolution. Important intellects among them, such as Dr. Thomas Nagel, currentlyprofessor of philosophy at the University of California, and those at Berkleyand Princeton. Professor Nagel uncovered a number of fundamental contradictionsthat argue against current evolutionary theory.40 [notes.html#ch03note40] Sincethen he has been under fire from his colleagues. Why, oh why, do scientists, whooften went to the same schools, fight one another so vehemently?The catchword is always ideology. The pro-Darwin faction is reviled asmaterialists, the opposing school dismissed as creationists who still believe ina god. Yet god means nothing at all to many who hold views against evolution.Opinions are entrenched and judgments have been made. Such behavior in scienceis no different to religion or ideology. The one side doesn’t even bother toread the books of the other side. Each group insists that it is right. And eachgroup looks with pity on the other which “simply refuses to see sense.” Thepioneer Craig Venter believed he had decoded the human genome, made the“transparent human being” visible. Then clever geneticists found that there isno generally valid genome. For genes do not just work by themselves. They arealways active in association with hundreds of other genes. The idea that genesare lined up on a string like pearls is deceptive. “All the genetic materialcontains overlapping information,” confirms Dr. Roderic Guigo from the Centrefor Genome Regulation in Barcelona.41 [notes.html#ch03note41]And these busy researchers keep coming across things that are impossible, thingsthat can be proved but should not exist. Such “impossible things” appearbriefly, cause irritation, and are immediately dumped back in the chamber offorgetfulness. What kind of things?In 1960, several stone tools were found near Hueyatlaco, 120 kilometerssoutheast of Mexico City. They were dated by four different methods: 1) uraniumdating, 2) fission track dating, 3) tephra hydration, and 4) mineral weathering.All methods produced an age of about 250,000 years. Impossible for theevolutionists. There could not be any human tools 250,000 years ago. MichaelCremo and Richard Thomson, both scientists, wrote in their thoroughly researchedbook Forbidden Archaeology:...the problem lies much deeper than Hueyatlaco. It concerns the manipulation ofscientific thinking through the suppression of puzzling data. Data which callthe currently prevailing way of thinking into question.... Our work inHueyatlaco was rejected by most archaeologists because it contradicts thetheory. Their argumentation is circular. Homo sapiens sapiens developed inEurasia about 30–50,000 years ago. Hence it is impossible that there are toolswhich are 250,000 years old which can be traced back to Homo sapiens sapienssince Homo sapiens sapiens did not arise until about 30,000 years ago, etc. Sucha way of thinking produces self-satisfied scientists but lousy science!42[notes.html#ch03note42]Cremo and Thompson, the latter a mathematician at Cornell University in Ithaca,New York, give several well-documented examples from the Pliocene (5.3 to 2.5million years ago) and the Miocene, which lies up to 23 million years in thepast. They are always bones, objects which have no business in the periodconcerned, but clearly exist.43 [notes.html#ch03note43] At Bruniquel Cave insouthern France, there is also a stone circle with a diameter of about sixmeters. It was dated by archaeologists from the University of Bordeaux to176,000 years. Definitively and unalterably. So someone acted purposefully176,000 years ago. Neanderthals? And why? Things become even more confusing:Bones were found in a cave in the Altai Mountains (the borderland of Mongoliaand Siberia) and analyzed at the Max Planck Institute for EvolutionaryAnthropology in Leipzig: “The clearly human bones from the Denisova Cave do notmatch the human genome. The genome of the Denisova human differs more than twiceas much from the one of Homo sapiens than the one from Neanderthals.”44[notes.html#ch03note44]These are by no means isolated cases, but hundreds of contradictory findingsthat the one side chucks in the wastepaper bin with irritation.As long as 40 years ago45 [notes.html#ch03note45] and thereafter I introduced athought to the discussion, which is today becoming more and more realistic:specific, artificial, external mutation. The Christian world is generallyfamiliar with the “virgin birth.” Mary, the mother of Jesus, is said to haveconceived immaculately from the “Holy Spirit.” The story is not, of course,true, as I have also shown.46 [notes.html#ch03note46] But where does this ideaof artificial insemination come from? In the Old Testament, such miracles aredescribed in several places. The infertile women Sarah (Gen. 18:10–14) andRebecca (Gen. 25:21–26), and in Samuel (1 Sam. 2–5), and so on, all experiencedthe happiness of having been visited by some heavenly beings just likeMelchizedek, the king of Salem. But this “seed from heaven” was actuallysomething quite normal in the ancient Orient. Every ruler had to be of “divinedescent,” otherwise he wasn’t worth a great deal. The Egyptian god Amun-Re matedwith the mothers of the heirs to the throne. Alexander the Great (356–323 BC) issaid to have been conceived through a lightning bolt. The Assyrian kingAshurbanipal (668–622) was a son of the goddess Ishtar. Allegedly. Anyhow, hefounded a magnificent library of clay tablets. The Akkadian king Hammurabi(1728–1686 BC) also belonged to the heavenly births. His mother was madepregnant by the sun god. Hammurabi is known for the oldest written code of law:Hammurabi’s Code. Religious figures such as Buddha or Zarathustra were alsobegot through a “divine ray” in the body of their virgin mothers, just like thefounder of the Tibetan empire, Gesar, or the first emperors of China. The sameapplies to the original rulers of the Incas and Aztecs. The motif is ancientand, we might say, international. In the Babylonian Gilgamesh epic, which goesback to Sumer, Gilgamesh, king of the city of Uruk, was created by the godsShamash and Hadad: “Thus the great gods created Gilgamesh: eleven cubits high hewas...two thirds god, one third man.”47 [notes.html#ch03note47]It really becomes fantastical with the mutations practiced by the so-called godson hybrid beings, the chimeras which are said to have existed at least in thetales of the ancient chroniclers:They also begat human beings with two wings; furthermore, human beings withgoat’s legs and horns on their heads; and still others with horses’ hooves, andothers in the shape of a horse at the rear and a human shape at the front...theyalso made bulls with human heads...as well as other monsters...48[notes.html#ch03note48]This is how the Church Father Eusebius described it, who has entered churchhistory as the Bishop of Caesarea and as a chronicler (died 339 AD). Eusebiusquotes extensively from the works of the Egyptian historian Manetho. He in turnis mentioned in the Greek historian Plutarch as a contemporary of the firstPtolomaean king (304–282 BC). And what do Manetho/Eusebius say? That there hadbeen hybrid creatures of horse and human? The centaur says hello! Bulls withhuman heads? Didn’t one of those live in the labyrinth on Crete?For us rationally thinking people, there are only two alternatives with regardto hybrid creatures: all of it ignorant fantasy, or genetic design. Logically,chimeras cannot have arisen naturally. The numbers of chromosomes of themonsters do not fit with one another. If they existed at any time, then only byartificial mutation of the DNA string. Who mastered this technique thousands ofyears ago?One can take the view that all these handed-down stories of heavenly births,divine kings, or hybrid creatures were a product of our ancestors’ imagination.They wished for something like that. But that is too easy. The oldest writingscome from Sumer, cuneiform writing, and a little later from Egypt, thehieroglyphs. The first scribes, who, with some kind of stylus, produced thickeror thinner lines on their clay tablets, were no science fiction writers. Writingwas deemed to be a high art. Only a few mastered it. Yet in our time, we assumethat these original scribes had entrusted fantasy tales to their clay tablets. Isuggest that the rulers or high priests of the time would never have permittedsuch an abuse. The truth was communicated. Why on Earth, then, did they write,“Thus the great gods created Gilgamesh: eleven cubits high he was...two thirdsgod, one third man.”49 [notes.html#ch03note49]In our time, there have been new translations from a completely new perspectiveand they produce a totally different picture from before. I have alreadyreferred to the translation by Dr. Hermann Burgard.50 [notes.html#ch03note50]Dr. Burgard is a specialist in Sumerian characters. He knows every root word,every cross connection, every interpretation, and every previous work on thesubject by his colleagues from the school of Sumerology. Now he has tackled thetexts of the high priestess Enheduanna. She scribbled cuneiform on many tables4,300 years ago. Dr. Burgard accuses his colleagues of sticking with themisapprehensions of decades. On the basis of these ancient texts, Burgard provesthe former existence of a space station in orbit. This space habitat was reachedfrom Earth “with a smaller machine.” That in turn docked in a landing bay which“closed like a trap.”51 [notes.html#ch03note51], 52 [notes.html#ch03note52] Theprevious translations, undertaken by honorable scholars, are shown to beerroneous because they start from false premises. Thinking in a differentzeitgeist. In that far distant past of humanity, Dr. Burgard says, it was notsome heaven full of bliss which was sung about, not some meteorologicalphenomenon or natural disaster which was described. At no time was it aboutdiffuse religions or psychological nonsense but hard reality.The same—that is how I interpret it—applies to the texts about “heavenly births”and hybrid beings. Even if an extraterrestrial birth might have been imputed tomany a king or religious leader after the event, some of these geneticallymodified forms did actually exist. They were intended to guide humanity—themasses—in a new direction. These mutations were created without exception by thealleged “gods,” the ETs. Why for heaven’s sake? And how can it be proved?The proof has to be provided by the geneticists, and it should not even be thatdifficult. But where is the recognized expert with sufficient courage to gopublic? As soon as even just one artificial mutation can be proved in the past,the same rules apply as do with regard to the SETI censorship. With suchevidence, it is not just the existence of ETs that is proved, but also theirinfluence on human society. In any event, I can confirm that thesethousands-of-years-old traditions repeatedly report about human beings who wereconceived by artificial insemination. There is a clear statement of this in theLamech scroll, one of the Dead Sea Scrolls. (I have already reported severaltimes about it.) There we can learn that the seed of Noah was placed in the lapof Bat Enosh, Noah’s mother, by the “heavenly watchers.”53[notes.html#ch03note53] Now, and everyone knows it, we are all supposed to bethe descendants of Noah. Never mind what name the guy might have been given inother cultures.This means that all of humanity carries extraterrestrial genes within it. Whatwas that about the 68,000 differences between the human and chimpanzee genome?“Yet this means that the amino acid sequence of the 231 discovered codedproteins in humans and apes varies by 83 percent.54 [notes.html#ch03note54]We are indeed products of evolution—but not only. Why, however, must an81-year-old writer who is not a geneticist point out these connections in oursociety? Because I am familiar with the connections from the traditions handeddown in humanity—that is, what others are lacking. Also, some experts know verywell what I know but are not allowed to write about it because of theirprofessional ethics.The mother of all questions remains: Why? What will extraterrestrials gain fromproducing intelligent human beings from an ape species; repeatedly makingoutstanding leaders over the millennia; showing themselves in the form of UFOs,or, indeed, creating magnificent pictures in our fields? None of that makes anysense. Where is the context?Have you ever thought about ants? There are about 13,000 (thirteen thousand!)different species and worldwide presumably billions of the little creatures.There are safari ants, which do not build any nests but march about. There aremyrmicinae, formicines, black and red ants, forest ants, bigger and smalleranimals. There are said to be carpenter ants or weaver ants, which build theirnests from leaves. There are ant hills in trees and leafcutter ants, which breakdown leaves and carry them into the nest. Mainly in the Amazon, there are evenmixed colonies that engage in a regular slave trade and make the ants theycapture work for them. Then there are varieties such as the white and redtermites. All of them live in perfectly organized states with queens, soldiers,scouts, and workers.Normally, ant colonies are organized by castes. Each group is responsible for adifferent task, such as construction, food, parental care, or protection of thestructure. The females actually establish the nests. They lay thousands of eggs;the rest of the colony serves to protect and bring up the young. The termites,particularly the dampwood termites and Rhinotermitidiae, are very inventive.Their structures consist of a maze of passages that lead toward the inside tothe “royal chamber” and toward the outside to proper covered “access roads.”Ventilation in the building is perfect, neither too hot nor too cold. There are“fermenting chambers,” “mushroom cultures,” and even proper “guest rooms,” forcertain types of ants keep beetles as guests. They feed them and benefit fromtheir secretions. Ant colonies engage in proper warfare against one another.Then scouts are sent out, and they spy and inform on one another. Treacherousattacks are commonplace. Foreign queens are disrespectfully cut into pieces, andworkers are forced to work as slaves in the nest. This and many other thingsprove that there is a lot of experience in each ant state, but also memory andthe ability to identify and communicate.Do ants know who or what humans are?Stand before an ant hill and let the little creatures run up and down you. Theants will still not be aware of what a human is. This is how our memory, ourtechnology, our consciousness works. The little animals can stare into our carheadlights, hear the noise of our civilization, register our exhaust gases. Theywill still not recognize us. Gently place the animal into a glass, photograph iton your kitchen table, and then carry the ant back to its hill. The littlecreature will now run about excitedly calling out, “I was kidnapped by anextra-ant intelligence.” But all its fellow ants will of course know that thereis no extra-ant intelligence. The kidnapped animal is shunned, suffers fromdepression, and can no longer be happy. No one believes it. Even its closestfriends turn away. “What were you thinking?” they complain. “Do you think you’resomething special? Even if there is some extra-ant intelligence out there, whywould they choose you in particular? They would have contacted our scouts or ourqueen directly....”Can you see the scale of this? We humans could learn ant language in a specialtraining program and teach them to consume other foods than they do at present.It would also be within our power to end ant wars. After all, each war leads tothe torture and dismemberment of ants; suffering, exclusion, the destruction ofnests, refugees who no longer have a home and fear for their life. Why don’t wehumans stop the ant wars? How can we watch such terrible slaughter without doingsomething?Because we don’t care a jot about what happens in ant colonies.And the extraterrestrials in relationship to us? Quite clearly they do care ajot what happens with us. They do observe our wars, although they have the meansto stop them at any time. (Have you forgotten the disabled intercontinentalmissiles of March 24, 1967, at the Flight Launch Control Facility in Montana?)The ETs do not interfere in our politics, although they often smell to highheaven. They don’t kidnap or punish dictators, or reveal themselves on publicscreens or above football stadiums. Indeed, they don’t enslave humanity. So whatdo they want? Why the interest in us?The whole of the universe is inconceivably large. At least for humanunderstanding. Just as astrophysics posits a Big Bang (or several big bangs) inthe beginning, so philosophy (or religion) likes to see an “original God” at thestart. Plus and minus. Ying and Yang. The Big Bang creates matter, the “originalGod” spirit or information. With regard to the “Big Bang,” we do not yet knowwith certainty whether the universe is expanding forever or whether it will atsome point collapse again. Information, on the other hand, strives forinfinitude until the whole universe is filled with information (intelligence).Every nook and cranny of space is to become “divine.” The exchange ofinformation is to take place through all dimensions, periods, and parallelworlds. That requires the spread of intelligence. It has to infiltrate matterwith “spirit.” This process takes place through the multiplication ofintelligent beings. No intelligence exists without curiosity. It is the triggerof proliferation. That is why the original extraterrestrial intelligence makessure that life can arise everywhere. That is how the universe is infected withthe building blocks of life—the bewildering chains of molecules that only fittogether like a key into a lock.Life, and thus evolution, arises on every suitable planet. From this, the mostfantastic forms can in turn grow: crocodiles, grasshoppers, dinosaurs,elephants, and birds. But evolution also knows mandatory forms. Only specieswith the right instruments increase intelligence. Thus for creatures living inthe water, it is impossible to invent electricity or the computer. Or metals canonly be mixed with heat and turned into alloys. Furthermore, chains of moleculescan only be made visible under an electron microscope—an impossible discoveryfor snakes or crocodiles. Evolution is full of mandatory developments. They arealready contained in the building blocks of life. The development into apes wasno accident; there was no alternative.Now advanced extraterrestrial intelligences will probably have knowledge of moresophisticated astronomical processes than we do. They will know which suns areorbited by which planets, know which planets are in the habitable zone. Onlynow, after evolution has been at work for millions of years, are spaceships sentout. Not randomly, but to the specific places where life must have developed.When the aliens came to our earth we already had millions of species, includingour ancestors, the apes. The ETs caught a number of them, changed the basesequence in the DNA molecule, and implanted the mutated cell into the womb of afemale chimpanzee. A fetus might also have been grown in vitro (in the testtube) as a test-tube baby. After the gestation period, the female gave birth toa baby with the same skeleton, the same skull, the same physique, the sameimmunoreactions—but with additional hereditary factors that chimpanzees did nothave. Curiosity, the capacity for language = information exchange. There was asense of culture, such as for sculpture, music, painting, religion, and the mostimportant of all, technology. From today’s perspective, it made sense to screenthe first humans from the environment and place them in a “Garden of Eden.”After all, the first humans—let’s call them Adam and Eve—did not master anylanguage. From their ancestors they only knew grunts and sibilants. The languageof the first generation of humans was the language of the gods. This assumptionis today still reflected in the tradition of the Tower of Babel: “And the wholeearth was of one language, and of one speech.” (Genesis 11:1)The day came when “the gods” left for other solar systems to create furtherintelligence there. On their departure the following might have happened: Thefirst humans knelt before the aliens. The latter said, “We are no gods. We areof the same flesh and blood as you. Never create an image of God because God isintangible and undefinable.” The continuation of this imagined conversation canbe read in Moses: “Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, andsubdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of theair, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.” (Genesis 1:28)The instruction was clear: Intelligent life was to multiply and rule overnon-intelligent life forms. But there was one crucial commandment that the firsthumans must never break: They must no longer engage in sexual intercourse withtheir non-intelligent fellow members of the species. This would have beengenetically regressive. But it happened immediately. Someone carried on with anon-mutated fellow member of the species. This entered human memory as “originalsin.” The calamity started. When the “gods” returned centuries later, “itrepented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at hisheart.” (Genesis 6:6–8) The Flood was decided, the experiment was abandoned, anda new one was started. The father of humanity after the Flood was calledNoah—other cultures called him by different names. And he in turn was a figurebegotten by the “watchers in the sky.” Since Noah, we humans are no longerpurely Earth beings. Changed genes are a part of our genome.Humanity grew, spread over the earth, developed various languages and cultures.The constant disputes between the groups led each tribe to develop its ownweapons and better methods of defense. War may not be the father of all things,but the source of quite a lot of technology.Why were there wars in the first place? Could the ETs not have prevented them?The exchange of information among humans means that it was almost inevitablethat different opinions formed. The independence of mind, the pride of humanbeings led them to believe that only their own view was the correct one. The“gods” could have dissipated the tension and thus presumably created a peaceful,totally boring society. This, in turn, would have failed through laziness. In alife without tension, people seek to increase pleasure. This means their greycells aren’t exercised a great deal. We can invent something—but don’t have to.I presume that this is what lies behind the long-term plan of the ETs. What isthe first question in religious instruction?“Why are we on Earth?”“We are on Earth to serve God and one day get to heaven.”In today’s context the answer would be “We are on Earth to develop technologiesand spread intelligence throughout the universe.”Why such complications? After all, the ETs already master the technologies andcould spread them throughout space. They don’t need humans for that.Imagine that the ethnologists of a highly technological society visit a tribe ofStone Age humans. Are they supposed to instruct them how to build a car? Writingdoes not yet exist in the minds of the “stoneagers.” Mathematics and all otherarithmetical functions are unknown to them. The establishment of the firstschool would be just the starting shot for the development of society. There areneither steel works nor a battery factory for power. No sign of wheels, tires,compressed air, gearboxes, cogwheels, suspensions, brakes, filters, steering,spark plugs—let alone oils and fuel.The ethnologists will not even attempt to teach the indigenous people how tobuild a car. The development into an industrialized state can only proceed instages. That also applies to the universe. In space, millennia are notimportant. Imagine, further, that some intelligent species out there wants toknow whether there are other intelligent beings within a distance of 800,000light years. Do they broadcast radio signals on all imaginable frequencies? Getin touch! But radio signals are tied to the speed of light, which is about300,000 kilometers per second. So do the astrophysicists of the intelligentspecies wait 1,600,000 years for a response? (800,000 years there and 800,000years back.) And all of this purely in the hope that an answer might cometrundling back. It might be, after all, that there is no other intelligencewithin a radius of 800,000 light years or one which does not want to respond.There is no way around it. In order to exchange messages and experiences in thevast distances of the universe, an information network has to be built throughtime and space. This is underway. We are meant to be part of it. The developmentinto an industrialized society took thousands of years. Great-great-greatgrandfathers found a way to mix metals into various alloys. Others tinkeredaround with plastics; others had great fun with lightning and thought upelectricity. Off-road vehicles, tanks, aircraft, the atom bomb, and nuclearenergy were developed. Industrialized nations arose, which today would certainlybe in a position to construct giant spaceships. There are still knowledge gaps.Which rockets are the most effective? Does the “warp drive” from science-fictionfilms exist? How is speed faster than light possible? The curvature of space? Do“worm holes” exist? Could spaceships fly through them? Even if these impossiblescenarios were possible, even if ETs jumped around the universe at a speedfaster than light, this does not change anything in the development of thecosmic information network. Societies have to be built in space and time, whichare capable of all these “impossible scenarios.”That is why we are being given help from outside. Thanks to their knowledge, weare already in a position to build smaller UFOs. What did Benjamin Robert Rich,the director of the secret Lockheed Skunk Works department, say? “We alreadyhave the possibility of flying to the stars....”55 [notes.html#ch03note55] Andthe U.S. astronaut Ed Mitchell? “Not all UFOs are in fact extraterrestrial inorigin. Some of them are our own development...but we are by no means at thetechnological level of those who visit us.”56 [notes.html#ch03note56] The ETsobserving us neither want to kill us nor plunge the planet into panic. We arelike them: created via chemical evolution to the Darwinian. As it is laid downin Holy Scripture, “And God said, Let us make man in our image, after ourlikeness...So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created hehim; male and female created he them.” (Genesis 1:26–27) Whereby only linguistsknow that the Hebrew word Elohim, used in the Bible for God, in truth is aplural term. The gods. Humanity has been watched over for thousands of years tothe present day, including specific, artificial mutations of some leadingfigures. Even today—you haven’t forgotten, have you?—some ETs live among us:“Some of the extraterrestrials look like us and could walk down the streetwithout anyone noticing,” proclaimed Theodor Hellyer, ex-defense minister ofCanada.“Actually quite a respectable model,” says the opinion of one of my academicfriends. “But that’s all it is: a model. Everything dealt with here could alsobe explained differently without the intervention of ETs.”Correct. We humans can dissect everything. After all, it is a scientific maximfirst to try the most obvious reasonable answer. And for that we do not needETs. Yet the judgment as to what is the “most obvious possible” answer is aquestion of the zeitgeist.Are UFOs a fact or not? Even with hundreds of thousands of erroneous reports,there remain a sufficient number of properly scientifically documented cases.Are pictures really created in corn and other fields that were not made byfakers and grow within minutes?Is there a group of a hundred scientists who legitimately show that neitherchemical nor Darwinian evolution was possible without outside influence?Scientists who want nothing to do with “Creationism” or a belief in God?Do we possess traditions that are thousands of years old and tell about humansand animals created by “the gods”? (Gilgamesh: Two-thirds god, one-third man.The Lamech Scroll with Noah`s ancestry.)There is more. Hundreds of cultures from antiquity to the time of the conquerorstell of the same independently of one another. All of them were visited by“gods,” instructed by “gods,” and there was artificial insemination.This claim I intend to document in the next chapter.All photos courtesy of Erich von Daniken, Beatenberg, Switzerland.Image [../images/f0122-01.jpg]Smeathes Plantation, near Ogbourne, Down Gallop, Wiltshire, UK.

Why do Stone Age cultures thatlived thousands of kilometers distant from one another and had no contact reportrelated stories? Where do the conspicuous common elements originate? The veryinfluential French classicist and ancient historian Professor Pierre Grimal(1912–1996) defined myth as “chronologically disordered history.”2[notes.html#ch04note2] At their core, the original events had been preserved butfrequently not in the correct causal context and, furthermore, in a wrong time.Somewhere out there in indefinable space, “chaos” ruled. The world had not yetbeen created. Many of the oldest traditions start with this idea. Our ancestorscould not imagine the origin of the universe. Are we better informed today?Someone created order in this chaos. Who? Where does this someone come from? TheGreek poet Homer has Gaia arise and she in turn gives birth to Uranus—the starryheavens.3 [notes.html#ch04note3] The Old Testament places chaos at thebeginning. Then God enters stage right and creates order. He creates light, thenwater, land, vegetation, then the creatures of the sea, birds, and finally“cattle, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth” (Genesis 1:24), and onthe sixth day, as the crowning glory of Creation, the human being.How, actually, did the scribes of thousands of years ago know about theobligatory course of biological evolution? Human beings were not simply placedthere as finished creatures. Before them there had to live other creatures,before them in turn sea creatures. That was only possible if land and water werefirst separated and an energy source—the sun—shone in the sky. The sequence iscorrect.In Greek mythology, things are more confusing. The starry heavens—Uranus—producethe 12 Titans, male and female giants with immense strength. Their names areOceanus, Coeus, Crius, Hyperion, Iapetus, Cronus, Theia, Rhea, Themis,Mnemosyne, Phoebe, und Tethys. They begat children and those in turn children.Thus were created Helios, the Sun god, and Selene, the Moon goddess. Cronusbegat Poseidon and Zeus. There was war in the universe and on Earth. Zeus foughtagainst the dragon-like monster Typhon. Zeus finished the beast off with alightning bolt. How else?This Zeus (Latin for “Jupiter”) is described by Homer as the father of all godsand humans. He gives earthly kings their power. Zeus is also the designer of arobot called Talos. This Talos circled the island of Crete several times a dayand shot down anything that had no business on the island.4[notes.html#ch04note4] Zeus is also the father of Apollo, and he, in turn, isthe teacher of young humanity. Apollo’s main place of residence on Earth wasDelphi, the location of the schools of wisdom and the Oracle. Delphi lies at thecenter of an incredible geometrical network that already existed in antiquityand was set up by gods of some kind.5 [notes.html#ch04note5] Apollo, of course,possessed a heavenly chariot. He used it to fly each year to the “Land of theHyperboreans which lay behind the north wind,” but also over the ship Argo withits crew the “Argonauts.”6 [notes.html#ch04note6]All human fantasy? Fire-breathing dragons? Fights in space? Flying machines?Robots?Another of Zeus’s sons was called Ares (Latin for “Mars”). He was a war-likebeing who was always in the company of Phobos and Deimos (fear and terror).Phobos and Deimos are still the current names of the two moons of Mars withtheir impossible orbits. They are definitively the strangest moons in our solarsystem. They orbit Mars in almost circular trajectories over the equator andthey do so faster than Mars below them is rotating. Our astronomers say the twobodies are fragments from space that were once captured by Mars. This view hassome snags. Both moons of Mars rotate in almost the same plane over the equatorof Mars. One fragment might do that by chance, two is stretching things. In ourtime, several satellites have approached the moons of Mars and provided somequite good pictures. They are potato-like fragments with various craters fromstrikes. At a distance of 165 miles, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter alsophotographed a strange, monolith-like object with a clear, rectangular shadow.Buzz Aldrin, the second man on the moon, said, “There`s a monolith there, a veryunusual structure on this little potato-shaped object that goes around Mars onceevery seven hours.” Next to the craters, parallel stripes have also beenphotographed on the surface. That is why the attempt was made to fly past Phobosand Deimos at a lower level. But no satellite from Earth reached its target. Ourearthly probes went “blind” before they could transmit their images to Earth.Now we have two “potatoes with craters” but we know as little about the innerlife of these small celestial bodies as we do about their orbit. In the autumnof 1972, the then-most famous Soviet astronomer, Iosif Shklovsky, at theSternberg Institute in Moscow, told me, “I suspect that the two moons of Marsare hollow. Their orbits are not natural.” Furthermore, the craters raiseadditional questions. It is generally known that debris from space strikesplanets that do not have a protective atmosphere in which at least the smallerlumps would burn up. But why on such midgets like Phobos and Deimos? God knowsthe two don’t possess the gravity of planets or larger moons. It is difficult toavoid the impression that at one time an incredible barrage of rocks flewthrough our solar system. From where? What was the cause? Star wars like the onefought by Zeus (and others!)? And was Ares, the son of Zeus, who created theMartian moons Phobos and Deimos, not a god of war?Aphrodite (Latin for “Venus”) and Hermes (Latin for “Mercury”) were children ofZeus. People ascribed fantastical stories to them, yet the origin of all thesemyths remains shrouded in obscurity. The root of the Greek word myein (myth)contains the meaning of “mysterious.” What Homer wrote about the gods was, inhis time, already the result of a very long development. The gods weresuperhuman in the eyes of people, and yet they were similar to human beings.They lived in a kind of non-earthly state. They did not eat human food butambrosia, the heavenly food, and drank nectar, the heavenly drink.The gods were imagined to be omniscient and omnipotent and yet there are thingsthey don’t know about what is happening in their immediate surroundings. Theywere also similar to humans in their form, just more beautiful and of more nobleappearance.... They either reveal themselves to humans in their true shape orthey transform themselves into human beings....7 [notes.html#ch04note7]So far the gods possess exceptional characteristics: * They come from space. * They are superhuman but of human form. * They are technically far advanced of us: flying machines, robots, lightning weapons, Martian moons. * They do not eat terrestrial food. * Their shape is more beautiful than ours. They can transform themselves.And where do humans come from? In almost all the traditions, they were createdby heavenly beings. Greek myth reports that Prometheus, a son of the TitanIapetus, had descended from heaven to Earth. The word Prometheus means“forethinker.” This Prometheus possessed the knowledge of the gods and he alsoknew how the seed of heaven could be transplanted to Earth. So he took clay onEarth, wet it, and created a form out of it in the image of the gods.”8[notes.html#ch04note8] Prometheus took the good characteristics of the animalsand enclosed them in the human breast.Animal characteristics are said to have been transferred to humans? Does therenot resonate a primordial memory of an artificial mutation? Changes to the basesequence in the DNA molecule?The first humans, so Greek mythology tells us, did not understand anything abouttheir surroundings. They walked about like phantoms; they knew neither art nortechnology. “Then Prometheus attended to these creatures: he taught them toobserve the rising and setting of the celestial bodies, invented the art ofcounting for them, writing...but also shipbuilding...and taught human beingswith regard to all other circumstances of life...”9 [notes.html#ch04note9]Prometheus also instructed human beings in astronomy, metallurgy, and all kindsof sciences.Other authors, some of them unknown, reported the same about thatincomprehensible period. Diodorus of Sicily (Diodorus Siculus), for example, thehistorian from the first century before Christ, traveled the world for 30 yearsand visited all the libraries of antiquity. His historical work comprises 40volumes. In the second volume, he writes that the first humans had literallylearned everything from the gods, be it astronomy, metallurgy, road or housebuilding, the art of writing, the healing arts, and whatever else. All of thismust have happened in a very early time because it was the gods who taught humanbeings “not to eat one another.”10 [notes.html#ch04note10] When were ourancestors still cannibals?Prometheus is also the one who brought fire to human beings. To do so he took along stalk of giant fennel, held it against the passing chariot of the Sun, andin this way set the fennel alight. And soon the first fires were burningbrightly on Earth. The supreme god, Zeus, saw this as treachery. He had poorPrometheus chained to a cliff of Mount Caucasus. In Christian/Jewish mythology,Lucifer starts a fight “in heaven” and resists the command of God with hisarmies. Lucifer is cast out of heaven and brings fire to Earth. “Lux fare” isLatin for “making fire.”Are all of them just silly stories? Myths? A hundred and forty years ago, thehighly respected philologist Professor A. Wollheim, who had studied the ancienttraditions that had been handed down, wrote, “Anyone who sees myths as justnonsensical tales and nice allegories has no idea of their importance. The mythis something quite different: it is the most sublime expression of the mostsublime truths. Furthermore, it is also the primordial history of humanity.11[notes.html#ch04note11] (Author’s italics)Polynesia lies a long, long way from Greece. We understand it to mean theapproximately 50 million square kilometers of Oceania from Hawaii in the northto New Zealand in the southwest, and Easter Island in the southeast. All of itis Polynesia—dreamily called the “South Seas” in popular parlance. This islandworld is awash with ancient traditions which—how could it be any otherway—basically communicate the same content as in Greece. The creation story ofthe Maori in New Zealand tells about the creator god: “Io breathed in infinitespace. The universe was in darkness. There was no glimmer from ‘below,’ ofclarity, of light...”12 [notes.html#ch04note12]Like everywhere else, Io began to make light, create water and earth, thenanimals, and finally the first pair of humans. They were images of thecosmological primeval gods, created in their image. The inhabitants of theMarquesas Islands do not know anything different. They lie south of the equator,1,600 kilometers northeast of Tahiti. (Politically, the Marquesas Islands belongto French Polynesia.)“In the beginning the cosmos was in high heaven. Tanaoa lived in heaven...therewas no voice, there was no music. Nothing living moved. There was no day, therewas no night. There was only blackness, black darkness...”13[notes.html#ch04note13]On the island of Samoa, the primeval god, who of course came from the cosmos,was called Tagaloa. Like everywhere else in Polynesia, the emptiness of theuniverse is first described. There is only ‘chaos,’ no light, no earth, no land,no sea, nothing on which something could grow. He had come from the infinitudeof space, the great ‘Tagaloa.’ He had set lights over the earth, one for theday, another for the night. He had created land and water. Then he sowed theseed and created fish as well as animals on land. There are, so the tradition ofthe native inhabitants of Samoa says, nine different heavens and all of them areinhabited. Tagaloa appointed rulers over the different heavens, but alsomessengers between the heavens:Then Tagaloa, the creator, spoke to Tagaloa-le-fuli, “come here, I appoint youchief of the heavens.” Then Tagaloa, the creator, spoke to Tagalossavali, themessenger: “Come here, you shall be messenger between all the heavens. Startingwith the eighth heaven to the first heaven. They shall all gather in the ninthheaven where Tagaloa-lefuli rules.”14 [notes.html#ch04note14]We learn that many stars are inhabited, but that is also what it says in manyother original traditions. (I will come back to that.)In the creation story of Hawaii, there are even three creator gods: Kane, Ku,and Lono. Each has different characteristics, but without exception they allcame from space.And the wandering stars and the inhospitable stars, and the wandering stars ofKane, innumerable are the stars, the large stars, the small stars, the red starsof Kane. Oh infinite cosmos. The large moon of Kane, the large sun of Kane,turning, moving in the immensity of the cosmos...and they created the humanbeing in the image of Kane.15 [notes.html#ch04note15]Not one of these myths reached Polynesia through the white conquerors. It wasnot the Christian priests who taught the native inhabitants their knowledge. Alltraditions existed before. Jesus or other figures of Christian belief do notexist in the wide space of the Polynesian creation myth. Neither do any figuresfrom the Old Testament such as Abraham or Moses. The ancient stories were toldfor x generations before there was contact with whites. And everywhere thestories begin with the endless cosmos. A god or some gods move in the blacknessof the universe. There was neither above nor below, neither light nor shadow.The gods spent a very long time in this blackness until they were finallytouched by the light of a sun. The path of the gods to Earth is described inmore detail in the traditions of Kiribati. Kiribati is the collective name for agroup of islands that stretch north and south of the equator. The islands belongboth to Micronesia and Polynesia. Thirty-five years ago, I spent several days inthe astonishingly well stocked library of “Bairiki,” a village on the mainisland of Kiribati. There I studied the legends literally on site.At the beginning, a long, long time ago, there was the god Nareau. No one knowsfrom whence he came, who his parents were, because Nareau flew alone andsleeping through space. In sleep, he heard his name being called three times,but the caller was “nobody.” Nareau awoke and looked around. There was nothingbut emptiness, but when he looked down he saw a large object. It was TeBomatemaki—meaning “Earth and Sky together.” Nareau’s curiosity led him todescend and carefully set foot on Te Bomatemaki. There were no living creaturesthere, no animals, no humans. Just him, the creator. Four times hecircumnavigated the world he had found from north to south, east to west, and hewas alone. Finally Nareau dug a hole in Te Bomatemaki, filled it with water andsand, mixed both into rock and ordered the rock to give birth to NareauTekikiteia. Thus on instruction of the Creator, Nareau Tekikiteia was created,meaning “Nareau the Wise.”Nareau the Creator now ruled over Te-Bomatemaki, while Nareau the Wise was inthe earth. Then Nareau the Wise created the first beings endowed with reason.“And when the work was done, Nareau the Creator said, ‘Enough! It is done! I gonever to return!’ And no one knows where he has been since then.”16[notes.html#ch04note16], 17 [notes.html#ch04note17]This ancient body of thought can be reasonably reinterpreted from today’sperspective. Someone is flying alone and sleeping through space until he iswoken by a voice who was “nobody.” An astronaut lies in deep sleep. An on-boardmonitoring system registers a solar system with planets. The astronaut is wokenby the computer, a “nobody.” Below him, namely where there is the gravity of acelestial body, he notices a large object. The Earth. Once again in full commandof his faculties, the pilot decides to land on the alien planet. (“Nareaustretched his limbs, he wanted to know what kind of object it was...he descendedand carefully set foot on it.”) Next the astronaut flies around the new planetfrom east to west and from north to south. He finds no sign of life and decidesto plant the seeds of life. (“At that time there were not yet any spirits norany human beings but only mighty Nareau. He went four times around theworld...and determined that there was no life.”)The myth cannot tell by what means Nareau made life flourish. Perhaps theprocesses were too confusing to be understood. (“Nareau dug a hole in the earthand filled it with sand and water. Mixed both into rock...commanded the earth togive birth. Thus Nareau the Wise was created.”)The characterization “the Wise” could stand for “spirit,” “being ensouled,” or“living.” Where previously there was emptiness life now begins to sprout. Nowtwo elements of creation are at work: Nareau the Creator of all existence andNareau the Wise for the start of terrestrial development. (“Nareau the Creatorwas now above Te-Bomatemaki, while Nareau the Wise was in the earth.”)I have noticed a small difference between the principal god of Kiribati and theother super goods. Nareau went, “never to return.” Other divinities—Osiris(Egypt), Quetzalcoatl (Mexico), Gesar (Tibet), Nommo (Mali), and so on—expresslypromised to return.One island chain in the South Pacific is the New Hebrides. The nativeinhabitants of Malekula (one of the islands) tell that a long time ago,Barakulkul had come from heaven with five of his brothers. They did so in acoconut which opened by itself.18 [notes.html#ch04note18] This accords with thestory from the Fiji Islands, for there the first humans emerged from a shiny eggwhich the cloud serpent “Degei” had thrown to earth.19 [notes.html#ch04note19]For the Micronesians, heaven and earth were connected by ropes a long time ago.On one occasion, the brothers Tawaki and Karihi wanted to visit heaven. So theywent to the place where the ropes were hanging down from heaven. One of thebrothers managed by this means to reach the heavenly realms. And one of theHawaiian gods, Lono by name, left Earth in a cloud ship. He did so with theexpress promise to return in the far distant future. The same applies to theyouths Punifanga and Tafalin, both from Samoa, who “were borne up in the smokeof a might fire.”20 [notes.html#ch04note20] This immediately reminds us ofQuetzalcoatl/Kukulkan, the feathered serpent of Central America. Be it the Maya,the Aztecs, or still earlier the Olmecs, all of them were familiar with thefeathered/winged serpent that came from heaven and from which the originalteachers emerged.Professor Johannes Andersen, probably the foremost authority on all myths ofPolynesia, author of a 500-page work on them, notes, “There are innumerablecosmological variants on the origin of the ancestral parents.... The expanses ofspace are mentioned multiple times and the infinitude of the universe.”21[notes.html#ch04note21]Not actually a surprise, one might think, for the South Sea Islands are tinyspecks in the expanses of the Pacific Ocean. The native peoples stared upwardeach night, observed the course of the stars, and were lost in their reveries.But why did they think up the same or, at least, similar creation stories to thepeople in Egypt, Sumer, America, Australia, or China?Psychologists such as C.G. Jung developed the idea of a common archetypalconsciousness. Even if such an archetypal consciousness existed, where did itstart? After all, even this archetypal consciousness had to start in a brain.Through which inspiration, influences, experiences?I keep having to point out in my lectures and books that these archetypalmemories cannot be events from nature. Why not? Stone Age people experiencednatural disasters of all kinds: earthquakes, eclipses of the sun, volcaniceruptions, thunder, and lightning. They gave rise to the first nature religions.But the gods who came from the stars are not comparable because they suppliedinformation. They acted as teachers. They instructed human beings in many fieldsof the sciences and technology. This is told by all historians of antiquity. Noforce of nature takes humans “up to heaven”—into the spaceship—and instructsthem as follows: “Son of human beings, look outside. Do you see that small lightout there? You humans call it the moon, but the moon does not have light of itsown. It draws its light from the sun.”22 [notes.html#ch04note22] Then the personis told about the phases of the moon and about the course of the stars and theEarth around the sun, including leap hours. It can be read up in the Book ofEnoch, chapters 72–75 and so on. And all this happened in the Stone Age becauseEnoch was the seventh patriarch before the Flood.No nature religion will help us further, no lightning, no thunderstorm, and noearthquake. Scientific facts were communicated.Often variants of the same myths were handed down by the same peoples, whichshould not come as a surprise. These traditions were handed down before therewas writing. Stories were probably told through an endless relay from tribe totribe, family to family, until it finally became possible to set them down inwriting. The core nevertheless remained the same.One of the Samoan legends tells about the god Tagaloa: “God Tagaloa lived in theuniverse. He created everything. He was alone, there was no heaven and no land.There was no water, no rock, neither sea nor earth. His original name was‘Tagaloa-fa-atuputupu-nu-u’, which means ‘Origin of Growth.’”23[notes.html#ch04note23]As elsewhere, this primordial god creates the sun, then land, water, fishes,land animals and, as the pinnacle, human beings in the right sequence. This isdescribed in the following way:Then Tagaloa spoke to the rock, and “Lua`o,” a boy, came out. Then Tagaloa spokeagain to the rock, and “Luavai,” a girl, stepped out. Tagaloa brought both ofthem together...then Tagaloa made the spirit, the heart, the will, and thethinking.... Then said Tagaloa, may the spirit, the heart [feelings?], the will,and the thinking come together in human beings. And they combined and humanbeings were intelligent.24 [notes.html#ch04note24]The gods were always involved in the creation of human beings. Yet as far as Iam aware, not a single one of the creation myths reports that human beings haddescended from the apes or that some heavenly being had formed the human beingout of the chimpanzee. Oh yes—there is often talk of liaisons between gods andhumans, but not between humans and apes.Often the people of Polynesia linked their ancient stories with specificgeographical locations. Thus the ancient temple of Te-Mahara on the island ofRaivavae (French Polynesia) is today still deemed to be the location where thegod “Maui” landed after his space flight.25 [notes.html#ch04note25] The nativeinhabitants of Ati Ona, one of the islands of the Marquesas group, say the same.The small mountain Kei Ani is considered to be a sacred place although there isno structure there. The mountain was originally called Mouna-tuatini-etua, whichliterally means “Mountain on which the gods landed.”26 [notes.html#ch04note26]And of course (why should it be any different!) the South Sea islanders erectedtemples in honor of their heavenly teachers. These rectangular structures arecalled marae and they can be seen on many Polynesian islands.The Marae Tooarai on Tahiti is a regular nine-stepped pyramid, the one inRaiatea (French Polynesia) a rectangle made of monoliths. And even on the smallisland of Borabora, which has a circumference of merely 14 kilometers, there areseveral, although smaller maraea. Nowhere did I find sculptures chiseled intothe stone. No depiction of the gods, such as, for example, on the Maya pyramidsin Mexico. Just simple terraces or platforms in memory of and as waiting roomsfor the gods.Image [../images/f0147-01.jpg]The Marae of Arahurahu on Tahiti consists of several terraces.Photo credit: Erich von Daniken, Beatenberg/SchweizImage [../images/f0147-02.jpg]The Marae of Raiatea in French Polynesia, a former landing site of the gods.Photo credit: Erich von Daniken, Beatenberg/SchweizReinhard Habeck, a thoroughly honest researcher and author of many books on thesubject of extraterrestrials refers to a “cowshed of god” in an article for themagazine Ancient Skies (currently Sagenhafte Zeiten).27 [notes.html#ch04note27]This is a circular wooden building constructed by a Dinka tribe in Upper Sudan.Despite having a large diameter of 12 meters, the round house is empty. Itserves as a sacred site in honor of a god called Mayual, who is said to haveascended to heaven from this site.Many peoples honored their gods in places that later became sacred sites. Thisis what happened to a majority of the gigantic temples of antiquity. They aroseeverywhere where the gods were once active. The oldest Maya city of Tikal islocated in what is Guatemala today. But it was only founded because the “rulerof the heavenly family” had once descended here. This is what is inscribed on asmall Mayan plate, the so-called “Leyden Plate,” which is today kept in theMuseum of Leyden in the Netherlands. Another of these ancient locations, 20kilometers east of the Euphrates (south of Baghdad, Iraq) was called Uruk.(Biblical Erech, Greek Orchoi, Roman Orchoe.) Today it is Warka. Uruk existed aslong ago as the fourth century before Christ and is the location where theoldest writings were found, including the Sumerian text “Bilgamesh and Akka.”(Not Gilgamesh.) The cuneiform script tells about a temple built in honor of“An, who has descended from heaven.” The structure was erected “where a cloudspread over the earth...where a start was made from earth...where themagnificence of An started from the earth....”28 [notes.html#ch04note28]The god Enlil and the heavenly goddess Inana originally resided in Uruk. Theymaintained “the bond between heaven and earth.”29 [notes.html#ch04note29] Thegeographical space in which the incomprehensible occurred is a glob on theglobe. Mesopotamia, the home territory of the earlier Chaldeans, the Sumerians,and the Babylonians, is only an hour by plane from Egypt. That is why a brieflink with my book Evidence of the Gods is appropriate here:In the Pyramid Texts of Unas from the Third Dynasty, researchers keepencountering verses (so-called “Utterances”) in which the Pharaoh literallyflies in a heavenly barque:(Utt. 267) “A stairway to heaven has been set up for me so that I can ascend toheaven... and I climbed up on the smoke of the large vessel. I fly high as abird and light as a beetle on the empty throne of your barque, oh Re. And I ampermitted to sit on your seat and thunder across heaven, oh Re. I am permittedto lift off the land in your barque...”(Utt. 434) “You have helped every god who possesses an own barque so that theyset themselves up in the starry heavens...”(Utt. 584): “The doors of the (?)...which are in the firmament were opened forme, the metal doors which are in starry heaven lie open for me...”30[notes.html#ch04note30]There are many of these verses but our confused zeitgeist turns them intowishful thinking. The priests had imagined journeys of the pharaohs after death.This is nothing but scientifically misunderstood nonsense. Our busyEgyptologists are not aware of the links with ancient India. There, too, theleaders of humanity are ferried about in flying vehicles, so-called “vimanas.”The following extracts are a few examples:“‘Faster Matali!’ spoke Indra. ‘Be quick with my heavenly chariot...’ Matalisteered the chariot which gleamed like a sunbeam to the place where Ramaencountered his enemies. Take this heavenly chariot, Matali called out toRama...dressed in heavenly materials, Rama mounted the chariot and threw himselfinto battle such as human eyes had never seen before....”31[notes.html#ch04note31]“While Kalki is still speaking, two chariots descend from heaven, gleaming likethe sun, made of gems of all kinds, moving by themselves, protected byincandescent weapons.”32 [notes.html#ch04note32]“So the king sat down...in the heavenly chariot. They reached the expanse of thefirmament.... The heavenly chariot flew around the earth over the oceans towardsthe city of Avantis where a festival was just being held.... After a shortstopover, the king started again under the eyes of innumerable onlookers whomarveled at the heavenly chariot.”33 [notes.html#ch04note33]And these gods were never squeamish. The terrestrial rulers supplied the“heavenly” beings with gold and diamonds. In return, they were protected.Thereupon Hor-Hut flew up into the firmament in the form of a large sun discwith wings attached... when he saw the enemies from the heavenly heights, hecharged upon them with such might that they neither saw nor heard him. Within ashort period of time, no living head existed any longer. Hor-Hut, shining inmany different colors, returned to the ship of Ra-Harmachis in his shape as alarge, winged sun disc.34 [notes.html#ch04note34]There is no shortage of stories about flying vehicles in antiquity. The busycritics have no idea about this. King Solomon gave his lover, the Queen ofSheba, a flying chariot: “He gave her all the splendors she could wish for...andvehicles with which to drive on land, and a chariot which flew through the airwhich he had made in accordance with the wisdom given him by God.”35[notes.html#ch04note35] (Author’s italics) We even know about the speed ofSolomon’s flying chariot: “The king and all under his command, they flew on thewagon without sickness and suffering, without hunger and thirst, without sweatand exhaustion, covering a distance of three months in one day.”36[notes.html#ch04note36] (Author’s italics)These were facts recorded thousands of years ago. That our busy Egyptologistsand Sumerologists turned this into legend is understandable. The zeitgeist wasnot yet ready for the logical consequences. But meanwhile the links can beshown; exegesis—the interpretation—is no longer isolated to a geographicalregion. Myths are “the most sublime expression of the most sublime truths andmuch more. They are the primordial history of humanity,” according to ProfessorA. Wollheim 140 years ago.37 [notes.html#ch04note37]If we accept as a factor in even just one example that gods equalextraterrestrials, all the creation myths abruptly make sense from Greecethrough Polynesia to the jealous God of the Old Testament. And this simpleinsight also throws a light on certain construction technologies in ancienthistory. Once accepted, illumination passes around the world.Even the soil of Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, was the landing site of the godPerun thousands of years ago. Starokyivska Hill lies in the center of Kiev.Until the ninth century it had a religious building in honor of Perun, who longago “descended from heaven in a pillar of fire” in precisely this place.38[notes.html#ch04note38] Like Zeus in Greece or Odin in Germania, Perun wasdeemed to be the “god of lightning” who drove around the earth in his heavenlychariot. Originally the sacred site for this flying god comprised an area of10,000 m2. This has been shown by archeological investigations in Kiev.39[notes.html#ch04note39] Most of these ancient sacred sites were destroyed withthe advent of Christianity. This happened (almost) worldwide.We are quite well informed about the heavenly beings who came from the cosmos insilver and golden eggs in the pre-Inca period. Both in South and CentralAmerica, priests traveled to the newly discovered lands soon after the firstconquerors. Their job was to bring Christianity to the native peoples. But thebearded and not very pleasantly smelling ecclesiastics also noted what theindigenous inhabitants were telling them about their gods, written down morethan four centuries ago when flying was not yet occupying our minds. There werereports about “golden and silver eggs out of which came the teachers, theheavenly nobles.”40 [notes.html#ch04note40], 41 [notes.html#ch04note41]The Spanish chronicler Pedro Simon writes that a priest from the Chibcha tribehad told him the following about the beginning of all things: “It was night.There was still something of the world. The light was locked up in a large‘something hut’ and emerged from it. This ‘something hut’ is Chiminigagua and itcontained the light within itself so that it would come out. Then things beganto be.”42 [notes.html#ch04note42]The Chibcha are a tribe in the highlands and the valleys of the easternColombian cordillera. Logically they had no understanding of extraterrestrialtechnology. So the spaceship became a “something hut.” No different than distantEaster Island. The primordial gods were venerated as “masters of the universe.”They include Makemake, the inhabitant of the air. His symbol is the egg.43[notes.html#ch04note43] And the same thing exists thousands of kilometers awayin the highlands of Tibet. The so-called “Books of Kandshur and Tandshur” tellclearly about “pearls in the heavens” as well as of “shining glass spheres” fromwhich the gods emerged.44 [notes.html#ch04note44] “Kandshur and Tandshur” arenot actual books but folios in which the sacred texts of Lamaism are recorded.The term Tandshur means “translated teaching” and is a commentary on the“Kandshur.” No one knows their original age.The similarities in the content of sacred books is always intriguing althoughtheir authors could not know anything about one another. So the Inuit say thattheir great-, great-, grandfathers once came to present-day Alaska in “flyinghouses.”45 [notes.html#ch04note45] And the Tungus, a tribe in Siberia, claimtheir first divine couple had descended from heaven “in a silver gondola.” Thatis precisely how it was recorded by the famous polar explorer Fridtjof Nansen inhis book The First Crossing of Greenland.46 [notes.html#ch04note46] The work waspublished in 1891, once again a time when aircraft were unknown.It is the same across the world. In ancient Egypt, Nun was seen as the endlessocean of stars from which the primal god Osiris had once arrived in a “goldenship.”47 [notes.html#ch04note47] Just like the gods, his spouse Isis descendedin a silver barque from Sirius to human beings. Osiris and Isis, the heavenlycouple from Orion and Sirius. It was no different in Nippur, the millennia-oldSumerian city. The place is called Nuffar today and lies about 180 kilometerssoutheast of Baghdad. It once had step pyramids in honor of Enlil and Ninlil.Like in Uruk, tablets made of lapis lazuli (lapis is a blue shiny mineral) werealso found in Nippur, which praised the two gods “because they maintain the bondbetween heaven and earth.”48 [notes.html#ch04note48] Why, then, is theresomething similar in the Finnish national epic Kalevala? God knows the far northhas nothing to do with Baghdad in the south. The Finns refer to a “flame bird,”which brought wisdom from heaven and was also involved in fighting in thefirmament.49 [notes.html#ch04note49]We can leap around the globe. Cultures that have never met, never heard of oneanother, report about similar events which, without exception, took place in adark age when there was not yet any writing. Just being surprised about that isnot enough. We have to draw the conclusions. Human beings experienced thearrival of their primal gods from the cosmos. Once there was writing, theirmemories migrated to clay tablets, palm leaves, and wooden boards. Later theyturned into stone sculptures. The experiences of the venerable ancestors were toremain unforgotten forever. Thus, they grew to become an element of the culturalheritage, the religions, and were celebrated in folk dances or priestly song.The powerful impact of the past, the mystery of the heavenly teachers, was neverto fade from memory. After all, those gods had promised to return one day.Nothing surprises me any longer. The gods were visitors from alien solarsystems. What else? In Exodus the descent of God is described in the followingwords: “And Mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the Lord descendedupon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, andthe whole mount quaked greatly.” (Exodus 19:18)What did we turn that into? Religion. Those who don’t want to know go on abouthow it was only a tropical storm or volcanic eruption—and ignore that thetropical storm or volcanic eruption gave precise instructions. There was a flowof information. God has spoken. The faithful, in turn, see the true and only Godbehind it. As if the being of God, the sublime figure of Creation, would careabout a small ethnic group on a ridiculous world called Earth among trillions ofplanets. Even more insane, as if he would go racing about on this insignificantplanet with a vehicle that descends on a mountain in “smoke and fire” and makesit glow. Whereby the same “God” still issued the instruction before his landingto erect a fence around the mountain to avoid the people being harmed. Allprevious attempts at an explanation, no matter how clever and profound theintention, are on a hiding to nothing. The facts should determine ourinsight—not religious or psychological wishful thinking.What facts? Those of the temples across the world in honor of the gods.Teotihuacan in Mexico, the place “at which the gods conferred,” the place also“at which the gods are buried.”50 [notes.html#ch04note50] “During the period ofnight, when the sun did not yet shine, when there was not yet day, the godsassembled at the place called Teotihuacan.”51 [notes.html#ch04note51] And thisTeotihuacan is not some one-horse town where a few temples are located. All thebuildings on the main street, the “Avenida de los muertes,” form a model of oursolar system, including Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto about which the Stone Ageplanners could not know anything—other than through the gods, the teachers.52[notes.html#ch04note52] Uruk, one of five cities in Mesopotamia founded by thegods, was modeled on a heavenly city on another star.53 [notes.html#ch04note53]“In China, Hangzhou, Marco Polo’s Ling-gan or King-se, was called the ‘heavenlycity.’ They believed their city was an image of the cities of the gods in theheavens,” writes the ethnologist Karl F. Kohlenberg.54 [notes.html#ch04note54]And in Beijing, in the middle of the capital of the Chinese empire, there standsthe Palace of Heavenly Emperors. Just like that? So that atheistic Chinaremembers a “heavenly emperor”?How divorced from the world does theology and comparative religion have to be toavoid bringing the facts in the ancient texts, the sculptures, the rituals, andthe “heavenly cities” under one umbrella? An umbrella, by the way, which coversa multitude of things and provides a meaningful explanation for everything.Rome, the Holy City. Why is it located where it is? The god of war, Mars, oncemade a king’s daughter pregnant. What else? She gave birth to twins, Romulus andRemus. The children were set adrift on the river Tiber in a willow basket(remember Moses in the basket on the Nile) and were ultimately nursed by afemale wolf. Decades later, Romulus had long become king, and the god Jupiterkidnapped Romulus and took him to heaven. From that time on, his divine name was“Quirinus.” And the location of these incomprehensible events was called Rome.55[notes.html#ch04note55]Among the Germanic peoples, the supreme god was called Odin (also Wotan, theangry one). Of course his parents Bos and Bestla came from heaven. In the landof the gods, in Asgard, he sat on a throne and could oversee both the world ofthe gods and the world of humans. His war horse had eight legs and was thefastest means of transport in the firmament. On his shoulders sat the holyravens Huginn and Muninn, who on their wings could see everything that washappening on Earth. What was that in Egypt? Nothing on Earth escaped the falconHorus, a son of Osiris and Isis. The eye of Horus is keeping watch.Thor (Donar the thunderer) was a son of Odin and—as so often—a mixture betweenheaven and earth. Thor’s mother was accordingly the human Jord. Thor’s tool wasa gigantic hammer that hung on a magic belt. The innumerable enemies that Thorslaughtered also included the architect Thyrm. Why did Thor kill Thyrm? Becausethe latter was meant to build the fortress of the gods Asgard, but somethingwent wrong. In the end, many descendants of the gods landed in Valhalla.56[notes.html#ch04note56] And this, in turn, is not located in some arbitrary spoton Earth. Take a map of Germany and draw a line through the present-day citiesof Aachen, Frankfurt, Würzburg, Nuremberg, and Donaustauf. All these points havetheir origin in the Stone Age and can be connected with a dead straight line.After about 300 kilometers as the crow flies, the stretch ends at a hill behindDonaustauf. That is where the temple complex of Valhalla is located.Nowadays tourists drive up to the impressive columned hall by car. The temple inhonor of great Germans was built by King Ludwig I of Bavaria (1786–1868), butaccording to legend, the original Valhalla, the funerary temple of the god Odin,was in the region.Communities, cultures, and peoples are all connected by myth. In the view of theEast African Massai, who are located mostly in the south of Kenya, there oncelived upon earth a young man by the name of Kintu and he fell in love with thedaughter of a heavenly being that had visited Earth. The father permitted Kintuto go to heaven for a time to learn. But when the pair remained in love also inthe heavenly realms, the father sent both of them back to Earth to instructhumans in all matters.57 [notes.html#ch04note57] This is very similar to themyth of the Bantu peoples in today’s South Africa. There the heavenly god Nzamehad descended to Earth to investigate the planet. Here he fell in love with theextremely beautiful human woman Mboja. The pair begat a son and called himBingo. The supreme god was angry about this cross between a celestial andterrestrial being and the two of them were not allowed to return to heaven. Thepair instructed humans in all matters and now we know the origin of the popularexpression “Bingo.” Bingo! The Shilluk tribes in southern Sudan say that thefirst human being, Omara, had originally come from heaven. At that time, humansstill lived like wild animals and killed one another. But Omara weaned them awayfrom the animals and taught them everything they needed to know. Omara had alsofounded the first kingdom on Earth.58 [notes.html#ch04note58]Image [../images/f0159-01.jpg]Valhalla near Donaustauf in Bavaria, Germany.Photo credit: Tourismus Donaustauf/DeutschlandAlways the same: The original teachers always came from the stars. The Nubatribe lives primarily in the middle of Sudan and forms the largest non-Arabgroup. They are a group of more than a million people, which nevertheless speakdifferent languages. All of them have the creation myth in common according towhich the heavenly god Nuba ordered his divine messenger Su to bring grain tohumans. To this end, he was to lower the grain kernels “from heaven to earth ona long bamboo pole. As soon as the kernels had arrived on earth, the messengerof the gods was to beat a drum.”59 [notes.html#ch04note59] (According to otherversions, he lowers it on a long hemp rope.) As soon as the heavenly god heardthe sound of the drum, he intended to pull the bamboo pole up again so thathumans could not use it to climb up to heaven. But the divine messenger wasdriven by curiosity and he opened the sack of grain before he reached Earth. Nowsome of the kernels fell down directly on to the drum. The heavenly god heardthe faint drum beats and thought his messenger had reached Earth. So he quicklypulled the bamboo pole up again. The messenger fell to Earth and with him thesack full of grain, which broke open on the ground. So the divine messengershowed humans the grain and taught them how to make fields and grow cereals.Here the question arises as to the origin of certain foods. Both the Central andSouth American tribes hold the view that maize was brought to Earth by the godsand originally in four colors: yellow, white, red, and black. The same appliesto bananas. There is no knowledge of an “original banana.” Rice too is supposedto be a gift from heaven, the brilliant Indologist Armin Risi reports.60[notes.html#ch04note60]I wrote extensively about the Dogon tribe in the Republic of Mali, in my lastbook.61 [notes.html#ch04note61] Their heavenly teacher was called Nomo and camefrom the constellation of Sirius. This Nomo also told the Dogon about the Siriussystem. He explained to them that Sirius was a dual star (currently Sirius A +B) and that there were still additional celestial bodies in the system (whichare still unknown to our astronomers).South American peoples, including the Inca and Warao tribes, even say thatoriginally humans had lived in heaven and had descended from time to time tohunt here. It was only later that they settled here. But they had sporadicallybeen visited again and taught by their heavenly ancestors. Reports of the samekind can be found among the Kogi Indians in Colombia. They live in the mountainson the Caribbean side of Colombia. Their original heavenly teachers created thefirst humans, instructed them in all matters, and continue to visit them eventoday. It was the same teachers who warned human beings thousands of years agoabout a flood which would be intentionally caused and ordered them to buildships. “And the priests, the older brothers, all descended from heaven....”62[notes.html#ch04note62], 63 [notes.html#ch04note63]That is astonishing for a lateral thinker like myself, for the same story wastold worlds and oceans away from Colombia. The Sumerian King List <WB444>,currently in the British Museum in London, says, “After the flood had passed,the kingdom descended from heaven once more.” And the same is told in theGilgamesh epic, which also originates from Sumer. After the flood, the godsdescended from the heavens.Who would have the sorry courage to ignore this worldwide accumulation ofstatements? In what age are we living? In the 17th century or the age of globalcommunications? The Tootoosh native peoples on the northwest coast of Californianot only report about a Thunderbird, which descended from the heavens andinstructed their ancestors, but they also still represent this Thunderbird ontheir totem poles today. The Hopi in Arizona—this is something my loyal readersare familiar with—know about the heavenly teachers and naturally venerate theseteachers in the form of dolls. “The first world was Tokpela, the endlessuniverse. But right at the beginning, so our elders tell us, there was only thecreator Taiowa. Around him was infinite space. There was neither a beginning noran end, neither time nor form. Just immeasurable emptiness....”64[notes.html#ch04note64] That is how it has been handed down in the Book of theHopi, the collection of myths of this Native American tribe that today lives inArizona. And White Bear, the oldest Hopi, described to the NASA designer JosefBlumrich what originally happened:This is the story of my ancestors and the clans who came to this part of theworld. The continent on which my people lived for a long time sank into the seaand the people had to leave it.... In the first world the deity Taiowa createdhuman beings.... He gave them reason, he gave them knowledge, he gave them allthe things they need for their life. And he gave them the law and the dutiesthey had to fulfill in this part of the world.65 [notes.html#ch04note65]And as a cross-connection for new readers: Naturally the Kayapo on the upperAmazon, 8,000 kilometers distant from the Hopi, know the same thing andcelebrate it in their dances even today. These, then, are not just obscure taleshanded down but verifiable evidence: totem poles, kachina dolls, Kayapo dances,gods who have descended chiseled in stone worldwide, sacred places where thegods were once at work, and so on. We call all of this illustrative material.Bingo!And how do we act? We continue to live in the dulled, sticky mess of thepsychology of religion, which has answers to everything, none of which are true.Two years ago, I spoke at the theological faculty of a Swiss university in thedepartment of comparative religions—a quite ordinary lecture in a quite ordinarylecture hall with 30 quite ordinary students. I spoke about flying vehicles inthe ancient Indian writings, the so-called “vimanas.” When I had finished, thedean of the faculty explained to his students how these texts were to beunderstood. “When a young man today drives through the landscape in his open topcar, his hair flutters in the wind. He has the feeling that he is flying. Thatis what happened thousands of years ago. At that time the offspring of theprosperous rulers drove into the arena in richly decorated chariots, often withpearls, and drawn by four horses. Their long hair fluttered in the wind. Theythought they were flying....”And I thought I was dreaming. In the ancient Indian texts there is cleardifferentiation between chariots with wheels that roll on the ground, and thosewithout wheels that fly over and above the Earth and even to the moon. But inthe theological faculties, even those teaching comparative religion, peoplestill live in the Middle Ages. Nothing new is added. The same applies withregard to the most sacred book of Christianity: the Bible. Theologians persistin proclaiming that the Bible contains the Word of God. The famous Jesuit andprofessor of theology, Karl Rahner, the mentor of whole hosts of young priests,asserts that the story of the Old Testament “came from the God who ultimatelyrevealed himself in Jesus Christ.” The scripture of the Old and New Testamenthad the same originator. The Old Testament was from the beginning “an openprogression towards final salvation steered by God.”66 [notes.html#ch04note66]And the theology professor Jacques Guillet teaches that the stories in the Biblewere “without exception reports about the fulfillment of a Word of God. Thisschema applies in all cases.”67 [notes.html#ch04note67] Aha! In fact, and everytheologian should know this, the Old Testament is a work full of contradictions,written by innumerable authors at various times. And often texts from outsidesources were inserted. (For example, the story of the Flood that comes from mucholder Sumerian writings, or the stirring story of the little boy Moses whofloated down the Nile in a little basket. The same is already reported about theBabylonian ruler Sargon I, a thousand years before Moses.) The Old Testamentglorifies a pseudo god who descends to humans in smoke, fire, noise, and heat.In this context even the vehicle of this “God” is described in detail in thebook of Ezekiel. And since my first work, Chariots of the Gods, a copy of that“heavenly vehicle” has been drawn by a NASA rocket engineer.68[notes.html#ch04note68], 69 [notes.html#ch04note69] We know today what Ezekielwas describing. A similar thing applies to biblical manna or the Ark of theCovenant. Modern knowledge exposes the Ark of the Covenant as a life-threateningtechnical device which, furthermore, “is not of this earth.”70[notes.html#ch04note70]The explanations of our time are without exception sensible, logical, andscientifically comprehensible. But that is of no interest to any theologian.Professor Hermann Oberth (1894–1989), the “father of space travel,” told me someyears ago, “There are scholars who behave like stuffed geese. They no longertake in new knowledge.”The book of the Old Testament prophet Job describes a “leviathan” as follows(Chapter 40):His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron...Outof his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out. Out of his nostrilsgoeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron. His breath kindleth coals, anda flame goeth out of his mouth.... When he raiseth up himself, the mighty areafraid: by reason of breakings, they purify themselves. The sword of him thatlayeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.What is being described here? Jacques Guillet says, “Without exception reportsabout the fulfillment of a Word of God. This schema applies in all cases.”There are in our time increasing numbers of books by authors who can read the“Book of Books” in various languages and who correctly analyze the nonsense thathas been interpreted into the Old Testament. Thus Walter Jörg Langbein,theologian and comrade-in-arms from the beginning, picks apart “Holy Scripture”and uncovers the various original sources that were raided to make the Bible.71[notes.html#ch04note71] His analyses appear to have provoked as little interestas the work of Mauro Biglino, who fluently reads Hebrew and knows all the linksto the Aramaic and Semitic roots.72 [notes.html#ch04note72] In Mauro Biglino itbecomes clear that angels were nothing other than extraterrestrials and thatthere is a crucial difference between angels and cherubim: “While angels arepersons, cherubim are machines!”73 [notes.html#ch04note73] Every Bible reader isleft with the belief that a single great God has been at work in the OldTestament. Nothing of the kind is true. The reference is always to the “Elohim,”the gods in plural. Accordingly the translation regarding the creation of thehuman being is not “And God said, Let us make man in our image, after ourlikeness,” but “...we want to make man in our image...“74[notes.html#ch04note74]A fairy tale? No. It is the concordant primal memory of human beings and thesame is reflected in the tales worldwide.“Long ago there was a time in which all people lived up in heaven...”75[notes.html#ch04note75] So starts one of the creation myths of the Inuit. “Moonspirits” and “heavenly beings” created the first humans and later there was alsosexual contact between the “moon spirits” and Inuit women.The Japanese tribe of the Yamasachi tells of a time “when there were stilldemigods on Earth who commuted between heaven and Earth as they wished.”76[notes.html#ch04note76] Like elsewhere, here too it came to sexual intercoursebetween the “offspring of a heavenly deity” and humans. The product was—whatelse?—half gods, half humans. The Japanese Amewakahiko kings founded theirruling house directly together with heaven: “The origin of our ruling houseextends back into the age of the gods. With Jimmu Tennô, the sequence ofterrestrial rulers begins.... Now because this land is a land of the gods, ithappens from time to time that gods live as humans among us and unite withhumans...”77 [notes.html#ch04note77] Something similar can be heard in the worldof Egyptian tales. All rulers of the Old Kingdom descended directly from somegod or other.78 [notes.html#ch04note78] And those gods expressly wanted humanswho were similar to them.Kings as sons of the gods? Tibet, China, Greece, and many more say hello. Flyingchariots in ancient India, with Solomon, in the Bible? Already heard the oneabout the flying carpets in the Arabian and Persian tales?79[notes.html#ch04note79] The knowledge of visits by gods and the creation ofhumans is global. Not to recognize this is thoroughly unscientific. And thepsychological variations that keep being wheeled out in explanation of thisfantastical reality are no more than grumpy vanity.The Baltic Latvian people may be more closely related to us than remote KingSolomon. Their principal god was called Dievs. (For the Romans, “gods” = “die.”In French today, still “god” = “dieux.”) Dievs lived in heaven and ruled thereover vast riches. He rode around the heavenly mountain on his flying horse and,at the time of the terrestrial harvest, descended from heaven to earth.80[notes.html#ch04note80] Chinese mythology is familiar with nine heavens, wherebythe supreme heavenly god resided in the constellation of the Great Bear.81[notes.html#ch04note81] The original emperors reached the earth withfire-breathing dragons. In the Tibetan highlands, it is not just the firstruler, Gesar, who came from space but also many other gods.82[notes.html#ch04note82] And how? “Heaven resounded, the earth shook, there wasthe roaring of dragons.” The quote could come from the Old Testament. But itdoesn’t. It comes from Tibetan mythology. Other heavenly beings of Tibet “used arope or ladder to descend.... Many sons of gods descend from the heaven of thegods to the earth of humans. They then become the rulers and kings of humanbeings.”83 [notes.html#ch04note83]Tierra del Fuego, the southern tip of South America, is poles apart from Tibet.Like everywhere else, the primal human being, Kenos, came to Earth to bringorder to it. “Then he flew back to heaven; he now lives among the stars.”84[notes.html#ch04note84] It is no different among the Pawnee people in what isNebraska today. According to their teaching, humans were created by stellarbeings and the heavenly ones had come down to us repeatedly “with fire andsmoke.”85 [notes.html#ch04note85] (Food for thought: There are 11,000 kilometersas the crow flies between Tierra del Fuego in South America and the great plainsof the USA.)We lack perspective. Every scientist, however hard working, has to specialize.There is no alternative. Knowledge has become too extensive. The paradox here?Specialization is precisely the reason why the connections fail to be seen. Itis impossible for an Egyptologist to know the Indian writings of theMahabharata. All the texts from the field of ancient India are not even known tothe specialists in Indology. There are simply too many. If even the Indologistsdon’t have a complete overview, how, then, is the Egyptologist supposed to learnabout the gigantic body of Indian literature alongside his own specialism? Ofcourse! Super computers could show the links—to the extent that the texts werepreviously scanned in and the right program existed. Personally I need sixmonths to battle my way even superficially through the Mahabharata andspecifically the “Drona Parva” (part of the Mahabharata).86[notes.html#ch04note86] Scholars who make this effort just once in their livesknow for all eternity that the ancient gods can only be a reference to spacetravelers from distant worlds. Among those knowledgeable about the ancientIndian texts, any discussion about alien space travelers thousands of years agoonly provokes a weary smile. Of course they were here. Anyone who still disputesthis does not know the comprehensive textual material. The “Drona Parva”describes space ships in the firmament, then terrible “heavenly” weapons incomparison to which every tropical storm, every earthquake, every volcaniceruption is a mere hiccup. There was clear differentiation between “cities inthe firmament”—we would describe them as “generational spaceships” today—andsmaller space shuttles. Whereby, and this is worth noting, the men whotranslated these texts from Sanskrit into English lived in the last century,except one.87 [notes.html#ch04note87] Therefore they couldn’t have the faintestidea about mother spaceships, aircraft, space shuttles, etc. The translation ofverse 50 in the “Drona Parva” says specifically, “The three cities came togetherin the firmament.” It was translated in 1888!88 [notes.html#ch04note88] Weaponssystems are described that burn everything through “concentrated heat rays,”others are activated through the eyes of the pilot. Then there are hypnoticweapons or weapons that produce illusions in the firmament. Weapons that canmake mountain chains explode and others that could tear open the whole planet ifthey were deployed. The “Drona Parva” describes aerial battles between differentarmed flying machines, which can change their position in the firmament atlightning speed. This is where we need a short quote from my book Habe Ich MichGeirrt?Scorched by the heat of the weapons, the world staggered in heat. Elephants wereburned and stumbled about...The water boiled, all the fishes died...The treesfell by the dozen...Horses and war chariots burned up...It was a nightmarishsight. The dead bodies were mutilated from the terrible heat; they no longerlooked human. Never before has there been such a gruesome weapon, never beforehave we heard of such a weapon....89 [notes.html#ch04note89]The hair of the warriors and their fingernails and toenails fell out from theeffect of this weapon. All life paled because it was overlaid with the “deadlybreath” of the god. And far from where the weapon was deployed, even the unbornchildren died in their mother’s wombs.We Westerners have no idea. We bask in the feeling of being the greatest,indeed, the pinnacle of evolution. We don’t care about the ancient traditions ofcultures. And the weapons systems in the thousand-year-old texts of the “DronaParva” have long been adequately explained. They were “tropical storms.”90[notes.html#ch04note90] Since when do tropical storms cause the effectsdescribed? And since when are tropical storms also responsible for deadlyradiation that kills unborn children in their mother’s wombs? And in any case,how did people thousands of years ago know anything at all about deadlyradiation? We are resting on the completely false laurels of ourself-aggrandizement. The flying chariots of thousands of years ago? Nothing but“meaningless chatter” and “foolish fantasies,” so said Professor Hermann Jacobi160 years ago.91 [notes.html#ch04note91]One hundred and sixty years in the past! Yet the views of yesteryear, at thetime probably carefully considered by highly intelligent professors with greatintegrity, have at no time since then been questioned, at least not by therelevant scientists. There is no “new school.” The old knowledge is gumming upthe brains. And books like the present one or those of my outstanding colleaguesdon’t count. Why? I said so in the Introduction: Because its hypotheses andevidence do not fit into the laboriously constructed mosaic of establishedconventional wisdom, scholars will put it on the list of those utopian bookswhich it is advisable not to talk about.What to do? Provide enlightenment and let the zeitgeist do its work.The Bantu tribe in Cameroon tells of its oldest patriarch that he flew down totheir tribal homeland in a large hollowed-out tree. “Everything we can see wasmade by Mubei. First he made the earth...then the grass steppes... then put theanimals on them.... Nyoenduma made a great rock rain. Whereupon it opened withgreat thunder and brought forth the first two humans.”92 [notes.html#ch04note92]Humans created by some “heavenly beings”? This is also told by the small tribeof the Abasi in West Africa. Abasi brought the people living in heaven directlyto Earth. “He created all things. All things above, all things below. He createdthe water and the forest and the rivers and the springs and the animals. Hecreated all the things that are there in the whole world, but he did not createthe human beings...because they lived aloft with Abasi in his heavenly city.”93[notes.html#ch04note93]A “heavenly city” was also inhabited by the King of Salem, a priest of thesupreme God of the Jews.94 [notes.html#ch04note94] Or the Tibetan son of heaven,Gesar. He originally lived in a flying city that shone in the firmament and“possessed roofs of heavenly iron which resisted every lightning bolt.”95[notes.html#ch04note95] Or the Arab historian Nashwan Ibn Said, who died around1195, and who told about “a city of metal,” which had in the past appeared outof nothingness. The whole town had stood on “silver, gleaming pillars” and waterhad been guided through the facilities in metal channels.96[notes.html#ch04note96] Or Hadhad, father of Bilqis (Queen of Sheba). Hisresidence was “a flying palace made of metal and towers.”97[notes.html#ch04note97] Or, as already mentioned, the “three cities in thefirmament” in the ancient Indian “Drona Parva.”98 [notes.html#ch04note98] Or“cities in the heavens which gleamed like crystals,” described in the Book ofEnoch.99 [notes.html#ch04note99] Or...or...there are many such examples.Heavenly cities are simply a part of the traditions of peoples. Be it the mostforgotten tribe somewhere in Africa, be it in the highlands of Tibet, or be itin the profound books of the ancient Jews.Humans had to be able to speak before they learned to write. The first languagewas dictated by the gods. That is what several historians of antiquity say.100[notes.html#ch04note100], 101 [notes.html#ch04note101], 102[notes.html#ch04note102] “Human beings are only human through language; but inorder to invent language they already had to be human.”103[notes.html#ch04note103] The quote comes from the statesman and scholar Wilhelmvon Humboldt (1787–1835). A bush is a bush and not a moon. The sun is anilluminated sphere in the firmament and not a water course. Human beings arehuman beings and neither crocodile nor bird. In order to understand one another,the first humans had to mean the same thing. Only then does writing becomepossible. Moses was given the tablets of the law—if we believe the OldTestament—from his “God” on Mount Sinai. The Sumerians were given writing by thegod An.104 [notes.html#ch04note104] It is no different in Tibet, India, orChina. “We recall the fact that originally all letters and pictograms andcharacters were deemed without exception to be sacred by all peoples and wereonly comprehensible to the priests. According to that view, writing also camefrom the stars,”105 [notes.html#ch04note105] as Karl Kohlenberg, with histhorough knowledge of myths, confirms. Then, in about 1,600 BC this Hammurabi(1728–1686) appears, who—how could it be otherwise—was born in heaven. Hismother was made pregnant by the sun god. Naturally, Hammurabi became the King ofBabylon and as such he left a splendid body of law: the Code of Hammurabi. Thetext had been chiseled into an over two-meter high stone pillar, which wasexcavated at the start of the 20th century in Susa, what today is Shush in Iraq.In his laws, Hammurabi explicitly refers to “divine revelation.”106[notes.html#ch04note106] We should be able to assume that the legislator willnot start his imposing work with a whopping lie. But a lot is possible amongpoliticians. In 280 paragraphs, the people now know about the law, but alsoabout the financial system, the rules of inheritance, or of marriage. The Codeof Hammurabi deals with several categories of people. There were those who werefree, semi-free, and slaves. But within this class system, all people wereequal. The free people had to adhere to the rules between one another, as didthe semi-free people and slaves. Some examples:If a man breaks into a house, he shall be buried, after he has been killed, infront of the site of the break-in.... If a robber is not caught, the city andthe Elder shall replace for the person robbed everything they have lost.... If aman steels the underage son of another, he shall be killed.... If someone takesa wife but does not conclude a contract with her, then this woman is not hisspouse.... If a man hires an ox for threshing, payment shall be one measure ofgrain. If a donkey is hired for threshing, payment shall be a half measure ofgrain....Hardly a detail that Hammurabi has forgotten. His code regulates divorce,illness, property, inheritance law, the payment of day laborers, and much more,indeed, even the taking of hostages. At the end of his work, Hammurabi had thewords chiseled into the pillar: “...In the days to come and for all time, letthe king who rules this land observe the words of justice I have written on mymonument.”Many legislators from other cultures did indeed use Hammurabi’s code as a modelin the course of human history. Today, his original stone pillar is kept inParis in the Louvre.It seems that those gods, the heavenly ones from another solar system, haverepeatedly involved themselves in human development. And today? Where do westand? Clearly they are involving themselves again. What future will thatproduce?"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5WHAT NEXT?At the end of the 1960s, a book was published that changed the world: The Limitsto Growth.1 [notes.html#ch05note1] Published under the umbrella of the Club ofRome, an affiliation of various scientists, the title became a number-onebest-seller in all industrialized nations. The then UN Secretary-General, U.Thant, wrote an introduction uniquely in the history of the UN:I do not wish to seem overdramatic, but I can only conclude from the informationthat is available to me as Secretary-General, that the Members of the UnitedNations have perhaps ten years left in which to subordinate their ancientquarrels and launch a global partnership to curb the arms race, to improve thehuman environment, to defuse the population explosion, and to supply therequired momentum to development efforts. If such a global partnership is notforged within the next decade, then I very much fear that the problems I havementioned will have reached such staggering proportions that they will be beyondour capacity to control.Ten years after the publication of the book, our civilization would be in such amiserable state that the problems would be beyond our capacity to control. Howdid the UN Secretary-General come to make such a devastating statement? Hereferred to the thoroughly honest scientists of the Club of Rome, who hadcalculated the models of the future. These models were based on the dataavailable at the time. They were all correct, but there was one factor that wasvery difficult to calculate: human inventiveness, intelligence, and creativity.Thus, The Limits to Growth became the first fear-inducing title. Everyreasonable person had to be concerned about the state of the earth. Despiteknowing about the gaps in their models, the authors wrote, “Given the manyapproximations and limitations of the world model, there is no point in dwellingglumly on the series of catastrophes it tends to generate.” What catastropheswould be generated?...there will be a hopeless shortage of land even before the year 2000 ifpopulation growth continues as today......with the current increase in consumption, most of the most importantnon-renewable raw materials today will be extremely expensive in 100 years, evenwith the most optimistic assumptions of newly discovered reserves, technicalprogress and the use of suitable replacement materials......such systemic behavior clearly tends towards exceeding the limits to growthand then collapsing...2 [notes.html#ch05note2]After the well-founded warnings of the Club of Rome, humans had forest declinehammered into them. First the forests, then humans was one headline. Then barkbeetles would eat our trees and finally acid rain would do the rest.With all these scenarios, I ask myself why we are still alive at all. After all,we have reached 2016 and are swimming in crude oil. The biological time bomb hasnot exploded. Yet the apocalyptic horror show continues to be promoted. Nomatter whether we have a rainy or a hot summer, human beings are at fault ineither case. Billions of dollars turn into thin air in questionable funds.Silently (angrily?), the shaken populace pays up. After all, it wants to stopclimate change. As if carbon dioxide had caused climate change in any past. Tobe clear: Thousands of years ago, our earth suffered repeated climate change.Quite clearly verifiable. But at that time, there were neither industrialchimneys nor car emissions, yet there was still climate change. How about othercauses for the climate change we are currently suffering? In The Limits toGrowth the scientists note, “Carbon dioxide dissolves very easily in water.”3[notes.html#ch05note3] Completely forgotten?Who actually has an interest in placing all of humanity in a state of fear? Totell people things that are not actually true? And even if just a few models arewrong, why is the world press not up in arms about it? Is the world to beprepared to hope for some kind of savior? What has happened to the intelligenceof Homo sapiens sapiens, which increasingly floods world politics and increasingnumbers of universities with scientific nonsense like the so-called “gendermodel”? Gender? Everyone has heard about it but few know what it is actuallyabout. The word gender is used to designate the psychological sex of a person incontrast to their biological sex. Is there such a thing as a “psychologicalsex”? Yes. A man can feel themselves to be a woman and vice versa. The conceptof “gender” was invented as long ago as 1985 at the UN World Conference on Womenin Nairobi and framed in 1995 at the UN World Conference on Women in Beijing.Within the framework of equality between men and women, some women demanded aprogram to implement gender equality. Meanwhile, gender has grown into a properworld strategy. “Gender mainstreaming” is even one of the goals of the EuropeanUnion. But a few fundamentally correct thoughts have turned into a feministworld dictate. There are hardly any scientists left who have the moral courageto stand up against gender. One exception is the German Professor UlrichKutschera of the Universities of Kassel and Stanford. In an interview with theGerman news magazine Focus, Kutschera described gender as an “irrationaldoctrine.”4 [notes.html#ch05note4] With gender all scientific facts of biologywere denied. “The gender mainstreaming ideology comes from a radical feministsect-like esotericism of the 1990s. It is devoid of any scientific basis.”5[notes.html#ch05note5] The combative professor underpinned his analysis againstgender with an outstanding factual book.6 [notes.html#ch05note6]What is supposed to be so wrong about gender? We are all made the same. Thereare only unisex people any longer. The biological sex no longer counts foranything. Boys should actually be ashamed to have been born with a penis. Theoriginal idea for this nonsense comes from the American professor John Money(1921–2006). He already said in 1955 that all babies were born as gender-neutralunisex beings. In an experiment, he had one of two identical twin brothers,David and Brian Reimer, surgically reassigned as a woman. Although this perverseexperiment was a total failure, it is still propagated by the gender supportersas evidence of the unisex idea. Brian committed suicide at the age of 36, Davidtwo years later.Today, gender is taught at many universities. It is the same as evolutionarytheory: Anyone who does not adhere to “gender” is excluded from the community ofreasonable people. God as a male figure is no longer allowed. A court inPortland, Oregon has granted a person genderlessness. Jamie Shupe, born as amale, wanted to be neither a man nor a woman, neither mister nor ms., but MXShupe. “Jamie Shupe is now MX Shupe, and MX Shupe is waiting for a new ID cardin which it will not say male or female but ‘nonbinary’” writes the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel.7 [notes.html#ch05note7] I suppose next there won’t be any“rapist” or “stay-at-home.” (Translator’s note: Both are masculine nouns inGerman.) Either, after all, we are all gender-neutral.“These Romans are crazy,” was a catchphrase in Asterix. These people are crazy,we should say. And although millions of earth citizens worldwide, including nodoubt many scientists, are of the same opinion as myself, hardly any of it getsout. What is wrong with our media? With our sharp and alert journalists? Havethey all gone to sleep or is there a higher power somewhere that suppresses anycritical questioning?The problem lies in the poison that is ideologies. They have the same effect asdictatorial religions. And anyone who in a given geographical area thinksdifferently from what happens to be the ruling religion will be denigrated.Anything that is not left-wing thought is “populism,” “misanthropic,” and“regressive” for the Left. And anything that is not right-wing thought is a“betrayal of the nation,” “hypocritical,” and “mendacious” for the Right. Nodecent right-winger will attend an event of a left-wing politician and viceversa. The “dogmatists” reign supreme. Everyone wants to be “rational” and bewith other rational people. Irrationality means exposing oneself to ridicule—andno one wants that. Now, and this is a truism, every newspaper, every magazine,every TV station has an owner. It may be a rich family, an individual person, apolitical grouping, a trade union, or the state. Everything belongs to someone.Each owner wants to belong to the rational people in their trade. If ajournalist wanted to put something “irrational” into their paper, they wouldn’tget it past their editor. If they did, they would soon be out of a job. We don’thave to conjure up conspiracy theories to recognize this behavior of people.What is lacking is moral courage and anyone who has it is excluded. The sameapplies with regard to the puppet theatre of the so-called “broadcastingcouncils.” What was that about the extraterrestrials from the future in thefirst chapter? All of them beautiful people with sparkling white teeth, softkissable lips, and a delicate body. But no distinction between men and womencould be identified.In May 2016, 160 people came to a meeting at the Harvard Medical School inBoston for an exchange of views, which was originally meant to be kept secret.They discussed the question of the artificial human genome. Will we be able toproduce humans with specific characteristics in the future? The question isethically highly controversial because when humans can create specific humansthey are playing at being god. And they will do so; at some point, just like theETs have done.On June 28, 2016, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission,gave a remarkable speech to the European Parliament. It was about the departureof Great Britain from the European Union—so-called BREXIT. Juncker showed hisconcern and said, “Make no mistake, those who are watching us from afar areconcerned. I have met and listened to several leaders from other planets. Theyare very worried because they are wondering about the course the European Unionwill take. So we must reassure Europeans and those who are watching us fromfurther away....”The media interpreted Juncker’s words “several leaders from other planets” as atranslation error or slip of the tongue. Not so. Juncker gave his speech inFrench. The words pays (country) and planète (planet) are very different.Furthermore, the explanation of a slip of the tongue does not fit into thecontext of the text. (I speak French and do not need a translator.) Junckercontinued, “...et ceux qui nous observe de plus loin,” which means “and thosewho observe us from further away.” Now, Mr. Juncker should be given the benefitof the doubt that he was tired and annoyed by some hecklers. The question mustnevertheless be permitted: Is he aware of contact with extraterrestrials? Is itreally due to tiredness that his brain no longer kept things apart? And whatmakes me personally sit up and pay attention: The whole passage was removed fromthe official text of the Juncker speech. Censorship. But why in the world wouldextraterrestrials be worried about the cohesion of Europe? Why would theyremotely care about that? We can speculate. Presumably the ETs want to concludetheir treaties with a united Earth. Europe is one piece of the puzzle. We mustall be the same.Irrespective of such curiosities, humans are moving in an irreversible directionprescribed by computer technology and the inevitable arrival of artificialintelligence (AI).The meanwhile retired Professor Edward Fredkin (physicist, Boston University,MIT, and CALTECH) is convinced that the electrons whizzing around the atomicnucleus constantly exchanging information with other electrons are based onsomething like binary code. The whole universe, says Fredkin, is ruled by someprogram, just like in the model of god as a universal computer or god as amathematical formula. “What is life?” asks Fredkin. “What is consciousness, whatis thinking, memory, and those things?” Fredkin recognizes in our DNA, which ispassed on from generation to generation, nothing other than digitally encodedinformation.8 [notes.html#ch05note8] From the beginning, this informationcontains the answer to our development as a life form. Whether DNA turns into aplant (which one?) or an animal (which one?) is determined from the beginning.“The electron is nothing other than a part of the answer.” Somewhere out there,Fredkin says, there exists a “machine-like thing”9 [notes.html#ch05note9] thatcontrols the laws of the universe.This “machine-like thing” controls the extraterrestrials and they in turncontrol us. For years, brain researchers have repeatedly tried to pin down themiracle of God. Where does the power of faith come from? It should be possibleto show it in our grey cells, after all. Scientific experiments in a newdiscipline, neurotheology, have shown God is located in the brain. “Those whoare willing to engage in inner contemplation manage it. Those who lack faithwill not be helped by a magnetic field either.”10 [notes.html#ch05note10] Thedesire for something divine produces sublime feelings in the brain. Yet God as abeing cannot be found. “Looking for God in the brain is like opening up thetelevision to find the newsreader.”11 [notes.html#ch05note11] The fact that thebrain can produce an “elevated feeling” of God does not mean that “God as abeing” can be found. Electrons speeding around the atomic nucleus and exchangingtheir information with other electrons are not measurable. And placing a wholebrain under a scanning electron microscope is not technically feasible. But inorder to experience the “elevated feeling” of being in connection with somebeing of “God” requires the desire to experience just such a feeling. What camefirst, the chicken or the egg? Where does the desire come from? Our brain is,after all, a product of DNA and the latter of the cell. This, in turn, consistsof millions of atoms and the extraordinary electrons orbit each atom. The DNA iswhere the information is stored, which provides the data for the development ofthat precise form of life. This information exists before any life form evenbegins to grow.The 21st century will be the century of the technology of consciousness. No onecan dispute the evolution of computers; after all, they are becoming ever moresophisticated with each generation. Computers will grow into units that programthemselves. One of the leading lights in the computer industry, Dr. RaymondKurzweil, is convinced that by 2045 at the latest, artificial intelligence willmake humans superfluous. He calls that “singularity.” The artificialintelligence of the future would behave in such a way toward humans that wewould not even notice how intelligent computers are. Humans would not be able tonotice it in any case because they simply lack the intelligence. We would be toostupid for that.Some prospect! If the future of human beings no longer consists of anything butartificial intelligence, why then are humans necessary at all? And whyextraterrestrials? And why is it necessary for the human species to beinfluenced by extraterrestrials today if we will no longer exist in the year XYZanyway? Will there perhaps be superfast computers communicating with oneanother, and doing so faster than the speed of light and from star to starwithout us knowing about it? Is artificial intelligence perhaps developing alanguage that is incomprehensible to us? Or will artificial intelligence in thefuture take human form again for some reason to multiply more easily?In Greek mythology, Pandora was the first woman. The father of the gods, Zeus,gave her a box with the command to give the box to human beings, but the boxmust not be opened under any circumstances. Zeus of course knew that humancuriosity would lead to Pandora’s box being opened. We have long opened the box.This is the opinion of the Japanese billionaire and cybernetics pioneerYoshiyuki Sankai. In an interview with the newspaper Die Welt, he asserted,“Development is already very advanced; learning, artificial intelligence isalready in military use in a very advanced form...combat robots on four legs canclimb up mountains, can carry biological and chemical weapons and select theirtargets autonomously...”12 [notes.html#ch05note12] Yoshiyuki Sankai notes withsome resignation that we humans were the sole living beings who could overridenatural selection. Correction, dear Mr. Yoshiyuki Sankai. Extraterrestrials havebeen doing that for a long time.How did we conceive of the idea of artificial intelligence in the first place?The idea has been stalking through science-fiction literature since timeimmemorial, but it became official on April 17, 1990. That is when the AmericanDr. Marvin Lee Minsky (1927–2016), professor at the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology, received the prize of the Science and Technology Foundation ofJapan. He received it expressly for his concept of artificial intelligence. Theprize was presented to him in the National Theater of Tokyo in the presence ofthe Japanese imperial couple. Marvin Minsky had started studying studied theabilities of our brain as a young man and had raised the question: If the brainis a kind of machine, and if consciousness only arises because electrons andneurons are whizzing about causing an effect, then it should be possible tobring about the same effect artificially. Here crucial differences between abrain and a computer very quickly became apparent. Our brain functions becauseabout a hundred billion neurons exchange messengers between one another andcreate a cognitive system through these connections, the so-called synapses.Because each nerve cell can pass on hundreds of contacts, a neural network iscreated in the human brain of up to 100 billion connections. The crucial factorhere is that these neurons function as a network while with a computer thecommands are executed consecutively. This is the critical difference. The stepsin the computer were programmed beforehand. Be it by humans or computers, AI, isirrelevant. The computer performs “calculations,” even if at lightning speed.The brain, in contrast, has the “complete overview.” How does that work? Whenour eyes see a mountain landscape or our grandmother, they know in an instantwhat it is. Our brain does not have to “do the calculation.” We can also drive acar, pay attention to everything on the road, speak with our passenger, listento music, analyze an unpleasant smell, admire the mountain landscape, and thinkabout sex. We can do all of these things and a lot more simultaneously.In his brochure “Auf dem weg zu intelligenten Systemen” (“On the Way toIntelligent Systems”), Professor Rolf Pfeifer of the Department of Informaticsof the University of Zürich points to a paradox. A chess master, Dr. Pfeifersays, can remember about 50,000 moves that they can call up in seconds. The morea chess master knows, the faster the identification of moves. In a computerprogram, in contrast, the time for finding a specific move increases the morepossible moves are entered. “Human memory behaves in exactly the oppositeway.... The more it knows, the faster it can find specific information.”13[notes.html#ch05note13] The phenomenon was known as the “expert paradox.” Then,in March 2016, the British neuroscientist Denis Hassabis programmed aself-learning computer with the software AlphaGo. The game “Go” is considered tobe incredibly complex. Thirty million moves were entered. And lo and behold, thecomputer beat the best Go player, the South Korean Lee Sedol. A total of fivegames were played. AlphaGo won four of them. Beforehand, the computer with itsprogram had played innumerable times against itself and in doing so constantlyreprogrammed and improved itself. That is called a learning artificialintelligence. Will we humans therefore soon be duped by AI? And are the ETs outthere who influence our history and observe us nothing other than artificialintelligence?It cannot be ruled out. Yet our brain is much more sophisticated than theprogram AlphaGo because each human being is unique—but each artificialintelligence is not. Excuse me? The human brain is constantly programmed frombirth. That can be shown with an example.Before birth, every infant lay in the pleasant warmth of the womb. Let us callwhat they experienced there “pleasure.” No sooner born, and the baby begins tocry. It feels the opposite of “pleasure,” that is, “unpleasure.” The infantwants food, they scream. Equivalent to “unpleasure.” The breast or bottle isgiven—equals “pleasure.” The infant gripes, is tired, wants company; thiscorresponds to the feeling of “unpleasure.” Then familiar faces appear, thechild hears blah...blah... blah, they are stroked, have their nappieschanged—equals “pleasure.” A few years later, the child is taught what they areand are not allowed to do. The child has their own first experiences. They fallover, cut, or burn themselves. All of it “unpleasure.” The parents teach themwhich of the neighbors are nice and which ones aren’t. Pleasure/unpleasure. Afew more years later. The child has started going to school. Every time theyunderstand something or are praised, they register as “pleasure.” Theopposite—bad pupil—as “unpleasure.” Puberty follows. The first discoveriesrelating to their own body. The fervor of love, the rage of jealousy. Harmony,the happiness of togetherness, disappointment, the pain of separation, and soon. Everything is stored in the brain as “pleasure” and “unpleasure.”Now these experiences relate to all of us. So are we all the same after all?Ten people of the same age sit in the same cinema, breath the same air, see thesame film. Among the 10 there is a couple in love, holding hands. Someone elseis restless; something is bothering him. Another is constantly comparing theaction with another film in her mind. One person likes the actors, another findsthem silly. One is afraid of the end, the other cannot wait for it. The dialogueis terrible, one complains. The other person feels himself as the mainprotagonist in a heroic scene, and so on, ad infinitum.The same applies to every human action. Twenty people experience the camp fire,smell the scent of the wood, see the thunderstorm coming, but each one registersthe course of events differently, connects it with different memories. Fiftythousand people in a football stadium, 300 in church, 1,000 at a politicalevent. All of them experience something in common: the stadium, the teams, theuniting political or religious idea. Despite the many commonalities, each onehas different thoughts, emotions, memories. About a hundred billion neuronsexchange messengers in the human brain and create an extraordinary cognitivesystem through their synapses. But because every nerve cell is known to pass onhundreds of contacts, the neural network comprises 100 trillion connections.That number is not nearly enough. All people experience their sensesdifferently. The taste of charcoal, rosemary, nutmeg, or the feeling of alover’s skin is absorbed differently by each person. Stroking, pressure on apart of the body, a kick in the groin, or fist in the face are all different.Every human eye sees different things. The ears of a musician hear differentdetails from mine. This makes each person unique; scientifically easy to prove.Eight billion people live on the globe, but not one has the same fingerprint astheir neighbor. The same is true of the genetic code. Each person isdistinctive. And this also makes clear that the constant attempts of cleverpolitical men to make us all the same will forever remain an illusion.If we were all identical, no extraterrestrial intelligence would bother with us.Because each one would be the same as their neighbor, contact with a singlehuman being would be sufficient. “Humanity” would not be of interest. But now weare units that multiply with pleasure. Sex means the greatest pleasure. Then wecollect information for a lifetime and pass it on through electrons. The ETs outthere are dependent on our diversity.Artificial intelligence can program itself, can learn to solve highly complexmathematical tasks in fractions of a second. But it has no emotion. We may nowdesign robots that start to cry when they see something sad. Or others thatstroke patients. I can easily imagine kissing and copulating robots that looklike humans, act like humans, and smell like them. But they have no “spirit.”“There will never be spirit born from software. And that is not a question oftechnical development but an a priori impossibility,” says David Gelernter,professor of computer science at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.14[notes.html#ch05note14] “Our spirit is not static, it changes constantly. Notjust in the course of our life but even during a day.”15 [notes.html#ch05note15]That is what comprises the uniqueness of each person. It is not just a matter ofthoughts that a computer may be able to “reproduce”; it is a matter of thememories, feelings, emotions, words, and sounds that together comprise the“spirit.” This “spirit” cannot be confined. Information can be. Have theextraterrestrials somewhere stored a piece of information for us, ready to becalled up? Where would we have to look?All large organizations have stores of their knowledge. Examples? In the SecondWorld War, the Swiss blasted tunnels and large chambers into their mountains.Subterranean barracks and hospitals were built. Ammunition depots, sleepingquarters, ventilation shafts, and whole cable car systems were anchored in thegranite. Today many of these caverns, which could resist a nuclear attack, havebeen rented to companies on a long-term basis. That is where the knowledge ofthe company concerned is stored.All the world’s seeds are stored in Norway’s Spitsbergen: about one million seedsamples from potatoes, rice, wheat, grasses, and maize to every conceivableflower and crop plant. The facility, called Doomsday Seed Vault, lies in theArctic and guarantees secure cooling even in the event of a power failure.The Mormon Church, with its headquarters in Salt Lake City, has for decadesregistered all available data of humanity. About four billion records such asfirst and last names, genealogical information, and family history of bothsexes, and so on are stored in the so-called “Granite Mountain Records Vault.”The Mormon Church does not seek to keep its register secret. Everyone can findout about their family history there.The Church of Scientology operates a vast bunker system under the desert of NewMexico between Santa Fe and Amarillo, New Mexico, the Trementina Base. Itcontains 140 tons of books, writings, and steel tablets, as well as more than2,000 titanium capsules with computer data. The point on the ground in thedesert under which the mighty archive is stored is marked on the surface by asymbol that can only be seen from the air: two intersecting circles with adiamond in the center of each. Just like the pictures in the cornfields.Documents of all kinds have been stored for centuries under the walls of theVatican in Rome: the Archivo Segreto Vaticano, the secret Vatican archive.Alongside ancient writings from various countries, the records of theproceedings in the witch-hunts as well as of Papal policy during the Nazi periodare stored here. And, of course, documents about the contact withextraterrestrials. Fatima says hello!Where are the archives of the ETs? Are there any kind of extraterrestriallegacies on Earth? Enoch, who was instructed by the ETs thousands of years ago,told his son before his departure into space, “And now, my son Methuselah...Ihave revealed everything to you and given you the books which concern all thesethings. Preserve, my son Methuselah, the books from your father’s hand and givethem to the coming generations of this world.” (Book of Enoch, Chapter 81:10.Now the Arab historian Ahmad Al-Makrizi (c. 1300 AD), who cites ancient Egyptiansources in his work Hitat, assures us that the Great Pyramid had been builtbefore the Flood. By whom? By the same Enoch! And this Mr. Al-Makrizi is notmaking things up because he fastidiously lists all Enoch’s forebears up to thepatriarch Adam. He also writes that the pyramid contained “books about allsecret sciences. Furthermore, the treasures of the stars...a mightyquantity....”16 [notes.html#ch05note16]In fact, ever more shafts and chambers have been located in and under the GreatPyramid in recent years using the most modern measuring techniques. None ofthese chambers can be entered. The chimneys leading to them are too narrow tocrawl through. (Which throws a clear light on the planning engineers of thetime, who did not exist at the time of Cheops.) I for my part would not besurprised if books from Enoch with the messages from the ETs were found in thechambers.I have reported previously about Göbekli Tepe in southeastern Turkey, which isthought to be 11,500 years old.17 [notes.html#ch05note17] I know from a reliablesource that the place is at least 10 times bigger than generally published.Further excavations are deliberately not being undertaken. After all, somethingunexpected might come to light.A similar thing applies with regard to Gunung Padang. It lies in Java, 50kilometers southwest of the city of Cianjur and is said to be at least 14,000years old. C14 dating of human bones found within the site even produced an ageof 20,000 years.18 [notes.html#ch05note18] No matter which age is correct, oneway or another Gunung Padang would be older than the Great Pyramid near Cairo—atleast according to the dating of Egyptology.Gunung Padang lies 890 meters above sea level and consists of several hills withterraces, including some of the hard plutonic rock andesite (hardness 8according to the Mohn scale). Then there are walls of many thousands of basaltcolumns.Image [../images/f0196-01.jpg]Image [../images/f0197-01.jpg]Image [../images/f0197-02.jpg]Image [../images/f0198-01.jpg]Photos on pages 186–188: The misunderstood basalt structures of Nan Madol on thetiny island of Pohnpei (Caroline Islands).Photo credits: Erich von Daniken, Beatenberg/SchweizImage [../images/f0199-01.jpg]Image [../images/f0199-02.jpg]Image [../images/f0200-01.jpg]Image [../images/f0200-02.jpg]Image [../images/f0201-01.jpg]Image [../images/f0201-02.jpg]Photos on page 189–191: Basalt columns at the Gunung Padang site, Java.Photo credits: Ramon Zurcher, Archiv EvD, Beatenberg/SchweizImage [../images/f0202-01.jpg]Basalt path at the Gunung Padang site, Java.Photo credit: Ramon Zurcher, Archiv EvD, Beatenberg/SchweizThe site is reminiscent of Nan Madol on the island of Pohnpei in the CarolineIslands (Micronesia). Here too more than 100,000 basalt columns were used forbuilding and no one to the present day knows by whom and for what purpose.19[notes.html#ch05note19] In Gunung Padang, there are a number of curiosities.Magnetic irregularities are registered and in certain spots the compass keepsspinning. Measurements using geoelectrics and georadar show spaces deep belowthe site. Gunung Padang means “Mountain of Light” in the local language, and theplace has been a sacred heavenly site for the indigenous peoples for thousandsof years. Who knows what messages will appear beneath it? “The whole thing is atime capsule,” write the authors Vantari and Mumford in the magazine Nexus.20[notes.html#ch05note20]Time capsules from the ETs, prepared thousands of years ago for us people of thepresent time? Why bother if they are here anyway and could inform us at firsthand? With their messages from the past, they could prove to us eternal doubtersand disbelievers: It was us who founded your civilization. We brought about thepositive mutations in your evolution. We controlled development. Carefully—butsteadily.It is possible that writings will be discovered in an ancient structure thatexplain everything. It is possible also that the “time capsule” has beenorbiting our Earth since Odin’s time and is only waiting to be collected by thespace-faring generation. It is possible, furthermore, that a “von Neumann probe”has been orbiting in our solar system for thousands of years. What are “vonNeumann probes”?Johann von Neumann (1903–1957) was a brilliant mathematician. He developed theidea of a miniature robot that can keep replicating itself. It works like this:In the search for a suitable planet, a small probe is sent into space. As soonas the machine has found an inhabited planet, it remains orbiting in therespective solar system but at the same time produces a copy of itself. Thecopy, in turn, continues its flight. When another inhabited planet is found, theprocess repeats itself. The probes reproduce themselves like cells. The timecomes when there are millions of “von Neumann probes” flying around a galaxy.All of them collect data that they send home—wherever that may be. Are suchextraterrestrial probes flying around our locality as well? On November 6, 1991,the astronomer Jim Scotti from Arizona`s Kitt Peak Observatory discovered asmall object in our solar system. It was given the designation “1991 VG.” It wasthought to be a mini asteroid and large telescopes were pointed at it. But thestrange object out there reflected the sunlight in different colors. It had tobe something artificial, probably a burnt-out rocket stage. Precise calculationsof its trajectory produced the result that the alien object had already passednear the Earth in 1958 and 1972. In other words, before we started traveling inspace. The Australian astronomer Duncan Steel asked the question as long ago as1995 whether this might be an alien “von Neumann probe.” We will receive ananswer at the earliest in the summer of 2017 when the thing will go racing pastus again.We will very soon be able to document the visit of extraterrestrials alsowithout probes and time capsules. Increasing numbers of curious formations keepappearing on the surface of Mars that do not quite fit into the picture of anatural explanation. Enthusiasts who spend months sifting through the officialNASA pictures from Mars have found pyramid-like structures as well asrectangular obelisks reaching into the sky and triangular blocks with the sameside lengths. In addition, the riddles surrounding the moons of Mars, Phobos andDeimos, have still not been solved. The NASA probe DAWN, which flew past themini planet Ceres in the asteroid belt, provided curious images of apyramid-like mountain with black and white scratches, shiny white spots, andrectangular and square formations. As with all information that could turn ourworldview on its head, such evidence disappears very quickly from screens. TheNASA photos are publicly accessible but revealing pictures keep dematerializinginto a hole of non-existence.An old guard is at work on Earth that is attempting to sweep all discoveriesabout ETs in our solar system under the carpet and make them appear ridiculous.A pointless exercise, my friends from the other side! Despite diligentcensorship, such knowledge can no longer be stopped. The messages cannot beignored. Pandora’s box can no longer be closed.The British astrobiologist Professor Milton Wainwright from the universities ofSheffield and Buckingham has discovered organic substances from space at aheight of 40 kilometers. The particles definitively do not exist on Earth. “Theorganisms must come from space,” he told the British newspaper The Daily Mail.21[notes.html#ch05note21] “We found evidence that the DNA is not from Earth. Ifour organisms came from Earth, they must be contaminated with DNA from earth andthey are not.”Really such a report from the kitchen of a thoroughly honest scientist shouldhave gone around the world as a sensation. It was rapidly stifled.Mr. Nick Pope worked for the British defense ministry for 21 years. There he wasresponsible both for the secret UFO files and those that were subsequentlyreleased for public access. I have known Nick for many years and value not justhis British humor but also his serious analyses. It is to him that I owe sightof the files of the British defense ministry entitled “Global Strategic TrendsOut to 2045.” The document is 172 pages long and alongside the military futurealso deals with other aspects.22 [notes.html#ch05note22] Nick Pope says, “Asthings stand at present, computer knowledge doubles every three years. In 2023,certain computers will catch up with the human brain, and in 2045, they could be100,000 times more effective.... Could true artificial intelligence be possibleone day soon, with science fiction become science fact?”23[notes.html#ch05note23]We human beings have grown up on our world. The evolutionists are right, but notcompletely. The Earth was never a closed system. Throughout its developmentalhistory, there were always specific artificial mutations. It can be shown in thehuman genome—it can be shown in our traditions. Now a study group at the ETHZürich (Zurich University of Science and Technology) has found that data can befed into the DNA and subsequently read without error. Stored for all eternity.There is no point in trying to deflect humanity from the path of knowledge. Theevidence that human beings have been influenced by extraterrestrials throughouthistory to the present day is becoming more compelling by the day. In the longerterm, the anti ET lobby doesn’t stand a chance in any case. The message alsoresides in the DNA. In each of us. And it is passed on from one generation tothe next. We would do well to come to terms with the presence of ETs.
