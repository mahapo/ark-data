[{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" 1 Foreword This is a book I had to write from the heart. I've been carrying it around inside me for ten years, ever since my fi rst visit to Lourdes, that vast caravanserai where hope, despair and commercialism thrive side by side. I was haunted by the images and dirges I had seen and hea rd there. While I was following the trail of my astronaut god s through the five continents, I made a point of visiting every accessible visionary shrine. How alike they all were in essence! It became increasingly clear to me that th e phenomenon of visions is something that concerns us all. I did not forget my space- travelling gods, but there are some books that ripen like autumn fruit. What are the people who seem to be predisposed to h ave visions really like? Are they psychologically unbalanced religious fanat ics? Are their 'miracles' simply an attempt to ingratiat e them- selves with the Christian churches, especially the Roman Catholic Church, tha t accept their wonders as 'genuine'? Did the dogmas of the Catholic Church, which also p lay a vital role in visions, originate by divine inspiration? Are we really supposed to believe that God's word, the last Court of Appeal when authoritative Christian judgments are-delivered, is inspired by the Holy Ghost? Are the multifarious miracles which undoubtedly hap pen at places of pilgrimage delusions or self-delusions? Is there a broad basis of medical and scientific fa ct behind these miracles which makes them credible and explicable? While mountains of documentary material were piling up, while I was making special journeys to places of pilgrimage while I was rummag ing in many of the world's great libraries, a deluge of questions assailed me. As I am not by nature the sort of person who can believe, in the good old-fashioned way, but want to know what can be explained by our god-given reason without appealing to an anonymous and much- abused Holy Ghost, I set to work. I set to work as a curious labourer in God's vineyard, as someone who considers God too exalted an arbiter to be constantly invoking him in support of his arguments. After studying visions for years, I think I can say fairly safely that this is the first compendium of its kind. Consequently some questions remain open to discussion, but I hope that in the future competent scholars and ec clesiastical courts, too, will accept my researches into the cause and effect of the vast and complicated field of miracles and visions to rectify frankly and honestly the fal se conceptions that are still in circulation."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" 2 I should like to thank Dr. Robert Kehl, Zurich, mos t sincerely for many suggestions and for his special help when he acted as guest aut hor for one section.

Visions arise in intelligent brains. Every intelligent brain has the prerequisites for c reating visions. The impulse for producing visions is of extraterres trial origin. *** To establish my hypothesis of the visit of extrater restrial beings to our globe I drew a great deal of information from mythology. This stor e of knowledge from the old chronicles is fascinating because it preserved for mankind Facts with implications whose meaning and significance the writer could not recognize in his time. As far as contacts between terrestrial and extraterrestrial b eings are concerned, mythology is a treasure trove with more than a little importance. *** Extraterrestrials visited this and other solar syst ems, and on the planets that seemed suitable, they left behind scions 'in their own ima ge'. Certain groups of these descendants have an advantage over us: they tamed, developed, and trained the 'brain, the monster' better than we have done. These prefer red students or overripe intelligences are sending energetic thought impulse s to us, the brothers and sisters of the same heritage. These impulses are intended to s timulate and enlarge our consciousness. *** A few 'chosen people' -I do not mean religious pers onalities - have always found access to the wonderful unconscious, from which the y evoked visionary great discoveries."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 4 Chapter One - Visions - Do They Exist? Unfortunately I have never witnessed a vision. Not one of the 12,000 saints has ever said so much as 'Good day' to me, but since I was f irst at Lourdes ten years ago I have realized that the phenomenon of visions is somethin g that concerns us all. I saw people in ecstasy, I heard their doleful plaints, a nd observed endless suffering. I was disgusted by the exploitation of credulous creature s. I saw no miracles. 125 years ago a fourteen-year-old girl saw visions at Lourdes: to day five million pilgrims visit her shrine year after year. 'Lourdes' stands as an exam ple for hundreds and thousands of places of pilgrimage where miracles are 'performed' under much the same conditions. How can we explain this mystery, the 'perception of divine grace in man', to use the Catholic vocabulary? It always begins with individuals or small groups o f people having a vision of members of the Holy Family - in the Christian west mainly Mary, mother of Jesus, one of the archangels, or even Jesus Christ or God the Father in person. The apparitions seen in visions are not neutral. Those who appear do not come as mere observers, all smiles and blessings - they tell men what they may and what they must do and what they are strictly forbidden to do. All personified visions assert that they are envoys from heaven and divine messengers with t he power to save, redeem and even to destroy mankind. They interfere with religi ous and political affairs, they infiltrate and dominate the brains of mass assembli es. I went on pursuing my astronaut gods, but I could n ot forget the deep impression Lourdes made on me. I collected 'official' publicat ions and pamphlets about visions of the sort offered for sale at the pilgrimage shrines which spring up where visions have been seen. In every case arid in every place indivi dual visionaries or small groups of them unleash an unending sequence of processions, w hether the Church has already recognized the 'miracle', forbidden it or merely to lerated it in silence. 'The Church gives its blessing to what it cannot prevent' (Kurt Tucholsky). The human longing to believe in miracles is always stronger than any pro hibition. A few years ago a representative public opinion pol l was held in West Germany and Berlin. 53 per cent of the people questioned believ ed in miracles and visions, 36 per cent did not and 11 per cent did not know. I assume that those results were not solely representative of Western Germany and the inhabitan ts who were questioned. There are countries, especially Catholic ones, where the percentage of those who believe in miracles is much higher. In what primitive soil does this belief flourish? W hat obviously timeless force makes it thrive? Independently of space and time and cult ure? Untouched by the kind and quality of the different religions? In order to understand the phenomenon at all, you h ave to get to know the 'visionaries', places and circumstances involved. So at the beginn ing of this account I am giving detailed sketches of some astonishing cases of visi ons which have all the essential characteristics of such miracles."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 5 The event which made Montichiari, five miles south of Brescia, Italy, an attraction took place in the spring of 1947. A young nurse called Pierina Gilli saw a beautiful lady in a violet dress floating in the air in the hospital Chapel The stranger was weeping . Three swords stuck out of her breast but not a drop of blood flowed. The mysterio us apparition said in a mournful voice: 'Prayer, sacrifice, penance.' The pious Miss Pierina was perplexed. Was it a ghos t? Were her eyes and her reason deceiving her? Or had she, the simple Pierina, had a 'genuine' vision? At first she kept the extraordinary experience to herself. On 13th July, 1947, the miracle was repeated. This time the beautiful unknown was dressed in white and there were no horrible swords, but she was adorned with three roses, one white, one red and one yellow, which aga in protruded from her breast. Pierina was frightened and asked: 'Who are you?' Th e lady smiled and answered: 'I am the mother of Jesus and the mother of all .... E very year I want 13th July to be observed in honour of the \"mysterious rose\" (Rosa M ystica) .... ' (1) Slowly the vision faded. The miraculous apparition was repeated on 22nd Octo ber, and on 16th and 22nd November, 1947, in the village church. On these occ asions the strange lady answered a number of Pierina's questions. The last of these encounters was especially dramatic because the stranger solemnly promised to reappear at noon on 8th December in the village church. The news of Pierina's strange experiences had long ago spread beyond Montichiari until the whole of Lombardy knew about them. So it was not really surprising that on 8th December several thousand people travelled ther e, filling the church to bursting point and blocking the streets. It took quite an ef fort to drag the main character in the drama, Pierina Gilli, through the wall of humanity into the church. She knelt down in the middle of the nave on the spot where she had on three occasions met the beautiful lady, whom the people had long since christened the 'Blessed Virgin'. She began to say the rosary together with the crowded congregati on of believers and curiosity- seekers. Suddenly she cried out: 'Oh, the Madonna!' There was dead silence. No one could see anything, or rather, some people were not quite sure whether they could make something out or not. At all events, everyone fixed their eyes on Pierina so as not to miss the c onversation between their countrywoman and the Blessed Virgin. Information wa s passed on to the expectant crowd outside the church in brief hasty whispers. Pierina saw the Blessed Virgin, so the story goes, on a high snow-white staircase, once again adorned with white, yellow and red roses . With an otherworldly smile the lady proclaimed: 'I am the Immaculate Conception. I am Mary of Grace, mother of my divine son Jesus Christ.' As she descended the white staircase, she said to P ierina:"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 6 'Now that I have come to Montichiari I wish to be c alled \"the mysterious rose\".' When she reached the bottom step, she promised: 'Whoever prays on this tile and weeps tears of repentance will find a sure ladder to heav en and receive grace and protection through my maternal heart.' For nineteen long years nothing happened. As so often happens, Pierina was mocked by some and already referred to as a saint by others. After 8th December, 1947, the church of the vision was the goal of believers in miracles and people in search of a cur e, for a series of miracles took place here in Montichiari, there is no doubt about that. Pierina spent 'white Sunday' of 17th April, 1966, i n the neighbouring village of Fontanelle, which is only about two miles from Mont ichiari. While Pierina was sitting on the steps that led to a small spring, to her com plete surprise the 'mysterious rose' hovered over the surface of the water. She ordered Pierina to kiss the steps three times from top to bottom and told her to set up a crucifi x to the left of the bottom step. The vision said that anyone who was sick should pray to the Lord Jesus for their sins to be forgiven and kiss the crucifix before taking water from the spring to drink. Pierina carried out her orders. At about 11.40 on 13th May, 1966, when about twenty people were praying with her near the spring, the 'mysterious rose' appeared aga in and voiced this specific wish: 'I wish a spacious basin to be made here so that the s ick can immerse themselves in it.' Pierina, now on intimate terms, asked the rose-bedi zened lady: 'What shall we call the spring?' The lady answered: 'The spring of grace.' Pierina continued: 'What do you want to happen here at Fontanelle?' 'Works of chari ty for sick people who come here.' [2] With that the Blessed Virgin vanished. The sick can be cured at this spring at Fontanelle! The message went round the countryside like wildfire: bring the sick here! Mir aculous cures actually took place. The afternoon of 8th June, 1966. More than 100 peop le knelt in prayer at the spring. Pierina arrived soon after three o'clock. She told the visitors to say the rosary with her. A few moments later she interrupted the prayer and cried: 'Look up at the sky!' In addition to Pierina, some of the faithful also s aw the Blessed Virgin floating over a cornfield, six metres above the spring. Once again the lady was wearing her three roses and requested them to make hosts from the ears of corn. She instructed them that the se hosts should be taken to Rome and on 13th October to Fatima. When she had given t his; instruction, the lady was about to depart when Pierina entreated her to stay a little longer. The Blessed Virgin turned round to her chosen vessel, Pierina, who rel ayed to her the wishes and questions of believers, priests and sick people. The afternoon of 6th August, 1966. Over 200 people were praying at the spring. Pierina arrived at 14. 30 and once again asked ever yone to say the rosary. During the fourth mystery of the rosary Pierina cried: 'Our de ar lady is here!'"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 7 Prayers and conversation died away. Everyone listen ed as Pierina conversed with a being who was invisible to them. Asked for more det ailed instructions about the home-made hosts, the 'mysterious rose' said that so me of the corn should be sent to her 'beloved son, Pope Paul', so that it should be blessed in his presence. Bread rolls were to be baked with the remaining corn and distri buted in Fontanelle in memory of her corning. Since then people have hoped and prayed in Fontanel le and Montichiari. Every day and every night. As in many places where visions ha ve taken place. Taken by and large, that is a classical example of a vision. A person unknown before the miraculous event sees 'something'. Confused and perplexed by the experience, he or she spreads the news and summons the faithful to the spot. Are they specially qualified people? Are they more devout than the ave rage? Are they religious bigots? Are they extroverts? Do they want to get into the l imelight? In an attempt to answer these questions, I collecte d 'visions' for ten whole years. When I began I had no idea what an incredible mass of printed matter would accumulate. I have been selective, choosing charact eristic cases to stand for countless others, so that I can offer explanations of the phe nomena on the basis of this extensive sample. When I say that the estimated number of visions in the Christian world alone is over 40,000 (!) you can imagine how varied the material is. Riding a bold steeplechase through history down to the present day I am going to present the reader with documented cases of visions. Not until the vast ter rain has been cleared of undergrowth will it be possible to show what conclu sions can be drawn, and what explanations can be offered or are theoretically co nceivable. *** Every year on 16th August in Iborra, Spain, the fai thful pray to a blood-soaked cloth. This relic (*) has been the object of religious ven eration since the year 1010. At that time the Right Reverend Bernard Olivier is supposed to have been assailed by doubts when during the mass the tintinnabulum (bell used in the mass) rang to transform the red wine into Christ's blood. From th at moment, so the story goes, the blood mysteriously increased in volume, and it seem ed to the faithful as if it flowed from the cloth of the Lord over the altar steps dow n to the floor of the chapel. Imagination went so far that some determined women mopped up the blood from the floor with cloths, the annals record. The Bishop of Solsona, St. Ermengol, heard of the happening and told the Pope. Pope Sergius IV (1 009-1012) allowed public veneration of the strange relic, the bloodstained c loth of Iborra. ---- [*] A relic may be the remains of a saint or a sain t's possessions, also one of the instruments of martyrdom. ----"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 8 It is not always holy figures that provoke visions, their trappings can do it, too. Iborra is not an exceptional case. *** The pious Monsieur Thierry, Rector of Paris Univers ity, was murdered in Pirlemont, Brabant, in 1073. The brutal murderers threw his co rpse into a muddy pond. For a long time the inhabitants vainly searched all over the village for the victim, when suddenly a 'wonderful light', which radiated from t he I body, shone from the pond. In gratitude for this miraculous discovery an artist p ainted a wooden panel of the Blessed Virgin floating over the water. In 1297 the picture was transferred to a recently built chapel. During the consecration ceremonies, so it s ays in the records, the picture was suddenly enveloped in an 'inexplicable blaze of lig ht'. (3) Even though it was not officially recorded, I suspect that here too the Bl essed Virgin- tirelessly active everywhere, performed some other strange feats. Per haps she smiled at the congregation; perhaps she waved her hand in blessin g from the frame. *** On 23rd February, 1239, a small army of Christian w arriors fought against a vastly superior force of Mohammedans on the hill of Codol, three miles from Jativa, near Valencia, Spain. Before the battle six of the Christian leaders were praying before taking Holy Communion. They had just had time to confess their sins, but not to receive the host, because at that very moment the enemy's battle-cry reached the church from nearby Mount Chio. The leaders grabbed their weapons, sinc e prayer would no longer serve. Terrified that the Moslems might destroy the church , the priests hid the altar cloth and host under a pile of stones. The Christian knights were victorious. When the priests took the altar cloth from its hiding place, six blo ody hosts were stuck to it. But there was more to come! The next day the Moslems attacked with heavy reinforcements. The situation seemed hopeless and the Christians ha d to withdraw to the Castle of Chio, which they had captured the day before. The p riests had a brilliant idea. They tied the altar cloth, made sacred by the apparition of the hosts, to a pole and waved it at the enemy from the battlements of the castle. Tr adition relates that the altar cloth sent out rays of light far and wide and that they w ere so luminous that the enemy were blinded and fled. Is that a proof of the primitive power of vision? T hey can sway whole armies and even the battle cry 'Great is Allah!' is no help ag ainst the blood of Christ. No, visions are not always peaceful. If necessary, they can als o spread fear and panic. Any visitor to Spain can see that altar cloth with six red spots in the church at Daroca [4] At some time in the fourteenth century, the exact d ate is unknown, a mower gave himself a fatal wound with his scythe near Trois-Ep is in Upper Alsace, France. In memory of his tragic death the local farmers nailed a crucifix to an oak tree and called the scene of the accident 'A l'homme wort'. On 3rd May, 1491, the blacksmith, Dieter Schore, a sturdy man with no nonsense about him, wa s riding past it when the figure"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 9 of a lady in a white robe and wearing a veil appear ed to him. In one hand she held an icicle, in the other three ears of corn. She told t he bewildered smith that because of the sins and vices of the local people Almighty God wou ld send terrible diseases, heavy rain and frost to punish them if they did not repen t and do penance. But the lady said that the ears of corn were a symbol of blessing and good harvests which God would grant through her intercession. The blacksmith did not attach much importance to th e phantom: he wasn't going to breathe a word of it to the villagers of Niedennors chweiher. But then it happened! He bought a sack of corn in the market, but although h e was helped by some stalwart labourers he could not lift it on to his horse's ba ck, for the sack got heavier and heavier. Then blacksmith Schore, as we can understa nd, bowed to God's power and told the people about his vision. The priests under stood at once and summoned the faithful to form a procession to the spot known as 'A l'homme mori'. The fine lady usually had a firm hand on the pulse of her flock. Anyone who promises farmers a good harvest has won the battle already. Trois-Epis is a well-known place of pilgrimage in A lsace. (5) The Convent of Conception, Chile, belongs to the Tr initarians. In it stands a life-size gilded Cedarwood statue of the Blessed Virgin, whos e hands are not folded in prayer - they look as if they were throwing something! There is a good reason for this. When the city of Concepcion and the chapel in which the Cedarwood statue then stood were attacked by the enemy in 1600, the statu e of the Virgin is supposed to have left the chapel in a mysterious way and appear ed to the hostile Indians in a tree. She scooped up earth and showered the attackers wit h bog clods. It seems quite credible in the chronicles of the event that even v aliant Indians fled in panic at the sight of such a martial wooden lady. Today we canno t prove whether this is fact or charming legend, but it is true that the 'clod-thro wing statue' of Conception is devoutly honoured to this day. (6) I find it worthy of note that frequently visions ar e so far from 'ethereal' that they will even throw mud if they can ensure an effect on thei r, flock. The end justifies the means. *** Tradition tells of 'a terrifying occurrence', dated 3rd December, 1712, in Besancon, a town in the French Jura, today the seat of an archb ishopric. Magopholis describes this vision in his book Neue Galene des Ubematurlichen, Wunderbaren and Gehdmnisvotten, published in Weimar, in 1860. The sun was shining brightly in a cloudless sky whe n, about nine o'clock in the morning, people saw the figure of a man floating in the air, at a height of 'nine lances'. He cried out thrice in a loud voice: 'People! Peopl e! People! mend your ways or your end is nigh!' This happened on a market day and Mag opholis says that it took place 'in the presence of more than 10, 000 people'. After th ese harsh warnings the figure disappeared into a cloud as if it was ascending dir ectly into leaven. An hour later the"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 10 air had grown so dark that it was impossible to mak e out heaven or earth from a radius of twenty miles. In Magopholis's words: Alarm and terror seized all souls; many people died a sudden death. The population held processions and uttered fervent prayers to hea ven. At last, when three days had elapsed the air cleared again; but a terrible wind storm arose, much worse than any of the oldest men in the town could remember, and last ed for about an hour and a halt Then came a fearful cloudburst so that water poured down from heaven as if great barrels were being emptied, and simultaneously ther e was a tremendous earthquake that destroyed the whole city. Over an area fourtee n miles long and six miles wide only one castle, a church tower and in the middle o f the area three houses had been left standing. You can see them standing there on a round hill; you can also see some parts of the city walls and you can see flags and s tandards fluttering in the tower and the castle from the side where the village of Quetz lies. No one can approach them. In the same way no one can say what all this means and no one can behold the scene without the hair of their head standing up, for thi s is a miraculous and terrifying occurrence. The unidentified man from heaven - obviously of Chr istian origin because of his threat (Mend your ways or your end is nigh!) - caus ed great confusion by his appearance at Besancon. Those who are to be kept in fear of the Lord need an unequivocal sign from time to time. Besancon must h ave had an exemplary effect on the whole countryside. *** Since the story of human intelligence has been told there have been visions in all religions and civilizations. They have taken place up to the present day and will always do so. Belonging as I do to the Christian West, brought up in the Roman Catholic doctrine of deliverance and salvation, knowing that this book w ill be read mainly by readers from the Western world, I am primarily concerned with Ch ristian visions. But it is also true, and I would like to say so explicitly, that similar data giving rise to similar questions could be reported from Asiatic, African, Indian and South American regions. If I were to go into all these phenomena (which would be enti rely possible!) the result would be a volume the size of the Manhattan phone book. Howe ver, in order that the reader may have some idea of the ubiquity of visions, I ha ve added a VISION ALMANAC, at the end of the book. It records facts only, but it makes clear to anyone familiar with such phenomena in the Christian sphere that visions are by no means solely a Christian, and are certainly not an exclusively Cat holic, privilege. *** The Jews did not recognize Jesus as the Redeemer an d so His Holy Family did not concern them in the least. Why then does the Old Te stament literally teem with visions? Two angels appeared to Abraham, and also t o Lot before the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrha. Jacob, son of Isaac, who defrau ded his brother Esau of his birthright with a 'mess of potage', had to wrestle with an angel near the ford at Jabbok. Moses witnessed vision after vision. The best known was on Mount Sinai where he"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 11 was commanded by Yahweh to free the people from the ir captivity in Egypt. The story is that for forty years the Israelites follow ed a vision that shone like a pillar of fire by night and a pillar of cloud by day. (7) Even Bileam, who has the reputation of being a fals e prophet and a heretic, experienced a vision of God, and Nebuchadnezzar, wh o certainly has not gone down in history as one of the elect, was surprised by th e vision of a 'writing hand' during a banquet in Babylon. The archangel Raphael (today pa tron saint of chemists) appeared to the heroic Tobiases, father and son, in the apoc ryphal Book of Tobit. In addition to other visions, the Son of Man appeared to the pious David on a cloud in heaven - i.e. at a time when the 'Christian' Son of Man did not e ven exist! Solomon, King of Israel and Judah, to whom we are indebted for the 'judgmen ts of Solomon', which are unfortunately so seldom recognized as such, saw the 'Lord' several times, according to his own account. And we must not forget that vision s already occurred in Paradise. God and various angels appeared to our disobedient ancestors Adam and Eve. (8) This list of biblical visions lays absolutely no cl aim to being complete. According to legend Rome was founded by Romulus and Remus, the twin sons of Mars. Exposed as new-born babies, they were suckled by a she-wolf and brought up by the shepherd Faustidus. One day Romulus, who is reputed to have reigned in Rome from 753-716 B. C. had a vision of Servius Tullius, son of Vulcan, who appeared in 'gleaming flames above his head'. [9] Herodotus, wh o lived in the fourth century B. C., was a widely travelled historian, one of whose majo r works was an account of the Persian wars. He relates that the Persians heard su ch terrible screams in the Temple of Athena Pronoia at Delphi that they fled. There are many stories about voices heard without the persons who caused them being present, 'acoustic' visions, in other words. In the temple of Aesculapius, God of healing, the g od made a daily personal appearance to those seeking cures - as naturally as a medical superintendent at the beds in a modern clinic. The famous lawgiver Numa Pompilius, second king of Rome according to legend, Minos, king of Knossos, son of Zeus and Europa, and Lycurgus, legendary lawgiver of Sparta, all received most of their creative idea s through direct visions of the gods. Aeneas, hero of the Trojan epic cycle, appeared aft er his death to his son Ascanius in full armour, together with his attendants. Caius Ju lius Caesar, born 13th July, 100 B.C., assassinated on 15th March, A.D. 44, appeared to a Thessa-lonian, whom he commissioned to inform his adoptive son Caius Octav ianus of the imminent victory of Philippi. Zoroaster, founder of the ancient Iranian religion, who emerged as a prophet in 600 B.C., received crucial passages of the Avest a (the religious text of his followers) in several visions. Mohammed, circa 570- 623 A.D., founder of Islam and prophet of Allah, the one and only god, felt himsel f called to higher things about 610. In Mecca he preached the revelations which are reco rded in the Koran and partly came to him in visions. Obviously the founders of religions would never hav e managed without visions: they used them as positive authorization from the supern atural. In that way their doctrines became more effective and attractive. Their wise an d clever ideas would have been sublime without calling on visions - yet the nimbus , the halo, released powerful impulses."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 12 *** The holy characters in visions are generally only o bserved and heard by male and female 'visionaries'. The urge to pass on their exp eriences turns them into heralds of the vision and symbols of the miracles that occur n olens volens soon afterwards. Like a snowball the miraculous news rapidly reaches a la rge number of people who seem to have been waiting for exactly this. That was how things began in the village of Fatima in the province of Estremadura in Portugal. From 13th May to October 1917, three shep herd children had visions of Mary as the 'Divine Mother of the Rosary', who cons tantly urged the children to erect a chapel on the scene of the apparition. The childr en related the story of their visions excitedly and enthusiastically. In the summer and a utumn of 1917 they were the main news item in Portugal and further a field. At first the three children alone received communic ations on the 13th of every month, but it did not take long before an endless caravan of pilgrims came to Fatima. On 13th October, 1917, according to reliable reports, there were between 70, 000 and 80, 000 people waiting at the scene of the vision for a mir acle to happen. And it was worth their while, for an event which was not confined to the shepherd children awaited them. It was raining cats and dogs: the conditions for a vision of Mary were wretched. But suddenly the clouds split open, revealing a patch o f clear blue sky. The sun shone brilliantly, but was not blinding. The 'solar mirac le' of Fatima had begun and everything that follows can be found in the records of the great day. The sun started to quiver and oscillate. It made movements to right an d left and finally began to rotate on its axis with tremendous speed like a gigantic C atherine-wheel Cascades of green, red and violet shot out of the star and bathed the landscape in an unreal unearthly light. Ten thousand people saw it and eye-witnesses claime d that the sun stood still for a few minutes as if it wanted to give them a rest. Im mediately afterwards the fantastic movement began again and so did the giant firework display of glowing lights. Observers reported that the spectacle could not be described in words. After another pause the sun dance began a third time, with the sa me magnificent display. The solar miracle lasted for twelve minutes altogether and wa s visible over a radius of twenty- five miles. In spite of government opposition at first, Fatima became the goal of pilgrims. Today it is one of the most important places of pilgrimag e in the world. On the first and last day of the visions, 13th May and 13th October, Fati ma is one great garden of expectation. Thousands and thousands of people hope for a vision, a miracle: but most of all they would like to experience the solar mira cle again. *** Examination of the total of recorded visions shows that in ninety cases out of a hundred children are the receivers and transmitters of transcendental phenomena. Should this objective statement be taken as an indi cation that young people before and during puberty develop special cerebral currents th at facilitate their access to another"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 13 sphere of consciousness (or infraconsciousness)? Or does native curiosity, combined with unbounded childish fantasy, open up special co ntacts with the astral world? Is it possible that visions are 'projected' into a child's brain and then transferred to the brains of other children of the same age by telepat hy, a medium that is no longer disputed by science? Is there any doubt that althou gh visions cannot be photographed or objectively registered by any other apparatus, t hey take place subjectively in the 'limbic system' (10) of out brain, in the archaic b rain tissue? If objective control of visions by outsiders is imp ossible, where do the words, orders, wishes and concrete instructions come from, over an d above the images that appear? How can the absurd idea that a strange lady wants t o be called the 'mysterious rose' get into a child's head? Are the children singled o ut by visions psychologically disposed or psychically susceptible to them? I do n ot think so, because the children who see visions are always described as normal heal thy creatures with all the usual attributes of their age. So we are going to investi gate visions seen by children, children of our time. As an overture to this part of my 'vision' opera I have chosen a case which in my opinion resolves itself into three questions. It ne eds describing in full detail. Sixty-two miles south-west of the Spanish town of S antander in Old Castille lies San Sebastian de Carabandal, Cara-bandal for short, a h amlet with narrow stone streets and about forty houses. Sunday, 18th June, 1961, 16. 30 hrs. Four little gi rls were playing in the market place. They were Conchita and Jacinta, both aged twelve, a nd Mari Cruz, aged eleven. Their surname was Gonzalez, but they were not related, fo r the name Gon-zalez is as common in Spain as Smith, Dupont and Muller are in other countries. The fourth little girl was called Mari Loli Mazon, aged twelve. These children decided to steal apples from their teacher's garden. About eight o'clock at night they were walking down the stony road called Calleja back to the village, with heavily laden skirts and very bad consciences. To fight the uneasy feeling they had in the pit of the stomach t hey picked up stones which they threw at an imaginary 'bad angel' whom they thought they could make out on the left- hand side of the road. (ll) Suddenly Conchita stopped and stared up at the sky. She told the others that she could see 'a very beautiful figure in a bright light'. Th e other three thought it was a new game, but Conchita insisted: 'No. no! Look over the re!' The little girls gazed at the clouds and cried: 'Th e angel!' They were quiet as mice and gaped at the sky for se veral minutes, as motionless as the angel who had appeared. Then the phenomenon vanishe d as quickly as it had appeared."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 14 The little girls ran home and told their story. The news spread like the wind in the superstitious village. Could four healthy, sensible little girls have seen the same 'face' at the same time, people asked themselves. Why should children lie fo r no reason, how could they each give exactly the same description of the event, as they were not expecting anything worse than being punished for stealing apples? Why did they stubbornly repeat their statements without a mistake, and continue to do so in the future? Their account was received with barely suppressed doubt. Children always want to make quite certain. So the four of them ran up the Calleja on the next day, with the rosary tightly held in their fingers. The angel did not show himself. On 20th June they repeated their walk accompanied b y a few curious villagers. As they were returning in disappointment, the children suddenly saw a 'radiant light' in the firmament. No one else observed the phenomenon except them. The next day a larger group was with them in the Ca lleja. This time the angel showed himself spontaneously. Once more the villagers did not notice anything, though some of them photographed the transfigured faces of the children. The mocking ceased. A certain awe of the supernatur al and conversation with the angel. To put it more precisely: they to the childr en on 22, 23, 24 and 25th June at the same spot. According to the children it was always the same angel, though he never spoke. The little girls were accompanied by a crowd of sen sationalists at the evening rendezvous on 1st July. The angel appeared and stay ed for two whole hours. Once again the spectacle was confined to the children, b ut those present heard the conversation with the angel. To put it more precise ly: they heard the little girls' questions and answers. On this occasion the angel s poke for the first time, introducing himself as the Archangel Michael. The audience were unanimous in describing the children's strange unnatural attitude. They knelt f or the whole two hours, their heads bent far back, frozen in a rigid posture. On 2nd July, a Sunday, the whole of Carabandal was afoot: swarms of people from neighbouring villages had hastened there. From 15.0 0 hrs onwards the rosary was recited in the church. Towards 18.00 hrs, the proce ssion, including doctors and priests, with the girls at its head, got under way. On the s cene of the vision four posts had been driven into the ground and connected with rope s to form a fence to stop the children from being crushed to death by the crowd. The miracle happened again. Scarcely had the children reached the 'ring' when t he Blessed Virgin showed herself to them, flanked by two angels. One of them Michael, w as familiar to the girls, and they said of the other that he might have been Michael's twin. The children made quite independent statements in which all the facts tally completely. They also contain a description of the Virgin which varied little on ot her occasions. She had long dark brown hair parted in the middle, a longish face wit h a narrow nose and soft lips, a"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 15 snow-white dress with a light blue cloak over it an d she wore a crown with gold stars on it. Her age was between seventeen and eighteen. As in o ther cases, the girls noticed that the figure did not move her feet when she changed p osition - she floated through the air. To the right of the Blessed Virgin they could make out a 'reddish flickering image', from which rose a triangle with an inscription whic h they could not decipher. The angels wore smooth blue robes. They too had narrow faces and dark ('black') eyes. Their fingernails were cut short - the children's o bservation was as accurate as that - and large pinkish-red wings grew from their backs. The village priest Don Valentin questioned the litt le girls. Four statements made quite separately from each other agreed down to the last detail. Peter Ramon Andreu drafted a report of the spectacu lar vision on 2nd July for Bishop Aldazal in Santander. The following is a literal qu otation: It was not possible to bring the children to their senses even with painful cuts, brutal blows and burns. They perceived nothing of the exte rnal world. One could convince oneself of this by suddenly passing a light or othe r object in front of their eyes. There was absolutely no movement of the eyelids or pupils . (12) There were two visions on 27th July. Early in the m orning the angel announced a second appearance for eight o'clock sharp in the ev ening. This news spread like wildfire. According to official estimations over 60 0 people assembled, among them priests and doctors and even a 'spy' from the Worke rs' University of Cordoba, a Dominican father. Archangel Michael arrived punctually and stayed for eighty-five minutes. Eyewitnesses claimed that the children became so ri gid that two men could only lift their small bodies with the greatest difficulty. Va rious attempts to move the heads or arms of the visionaries were unsuccessful. Naturally there were sceptics. Even the church had its reservations. People spoke of hypnosis, hallucinations, prefabricated lies and de ceit, even of promoting business for the benefit of the isolated farming village. Conchita, it seemed obvious, had the strongest pers onality of the four. So it was suspected that she might have influenced her friend s suggestively. To avert this she was taken to Santander to join other children and w ent swimming on the beach with them to cure her cramps. After a week had passed the family came to take Con chita home. Then things really began to happen! One vision after another, visions by the dozen. The interest of much wider circles was aroused. The avalanche of spectat ors that poured into the village acquired frightening proportions. According to an o fficial estimate there were more than 5, 000 people on 18th October."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 16 The weather was most unseasonable for the time of y ear with rainstorms and violent squalls. The field on which the crowd waited patien tly was turned into a quagmire. They stuck it out, because they were expecting a mi racle. Nothing happened. At about 22. 00 hrs a message signed by one of the children and ostensibly dictated by the Mother of God was read out. It called on everyo ne to bring sacrifices and do penance, because otherwise - as always in such mess ages! — mankind would be punished. I do not intend to give a detailed record of the ma ny visions at Carabandal. The literature is available for those who are intereste d. [13] *** What became of the four little girls? After the one great journey of her life - she visited the Pope in Rome - Conchita returned to her village, but soon entered the Order of the 'Calced Carmelites' at Pamplona. Mari Loli and Jacinta were received into a convent near Saragossa. Only Mari Cruz staye d with her parents, whom she helped in the home and on the farm. I find three important points in the logbook of the stormy events at Carabandal: 1. The miracle of the host. It happened on the nigh t of 18th July, 1962. About two a.m. the Archangel Michael is supposed to have appeared in Conchita's room, in which some relatives were also staying. It says in the re cords that the girl suddenly rushed down the stairs with face transfigured, and ran tho ugh the streets before throwing herself to the ground. She lay there rigid, with he r tongue sticking far out of her mouth. Eyewitnesses on the night declared that a sn ow-white fairly thick host suddenly appeared on the girl's tongue and remained visible for about two minutes. Then Conchita swallowed it. This materialization was filmed by one of the spect ators! About forty photos actually show a round white 'object', somewhat resembling a host. Witnesses swore that Conchita had made no movement with her hands or eve n touched her tongue. During this 'communion' she had neither withdrawn her tong ue into her mouth or under her gums: it was also inconceivable that she had concea led something so white in her mouth. Incidentally I find the amateur film taken b y a Mr. Daminas and developed in Barcelona a little miracle in itself. It was night and the only light came from some pocket torches. Isn't it a miracle that the film ex posed at all? 2. During the last vision, on 13th November, 1965, the girl received a message for the Pope from the Mother of God. In January 1966. Conch ita actually travelled to Rome, where she was questioned for more than two hours by the right reverend gentlemen of the Congregation of the Faith, formerly the Holy Of fice, and then by the Pope. (From Rome Conchita went to San Giovanni Rotondo to visit the wonder-working Father Pio.) 3. The really absurd thing about the events at Cara bandal is this: Mari Cruz, the girl, who works in her parents' home, suddenly denied tha t she had ever had a vision!"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 17 What was the reason for this retraction? Under the headline 'No visions have taken place in Carabandal' I read the following text in the 17th March, 1967 edition of the Catholi c newspaper Vaterland, which is published in Lucerne: In an official note dated 17th March, 1967 Bishop P uchol Montis of Santander established the following three points. 1. There has not been a single vision either of the Most Blessed Virgin, the blessed Archangel Michael or any other heavenly figure. 2. No message was transmitted. 3. All the events that took place at Carabandal hav e a natural explanation. One is dumbfounded. There are photographs and tape recordings from Cara bandal. All kinds of investigations were carried out, including a hearin g by the Congregation of the Faith. All the examiners confirmed that the girls' stateme nts coincided down to the smallest detail. Conchita was received by the Pope. It is not denied that 'events' took place, but a na tural explanation has been found for them. It would be desirable if official Church stat ements laid down not only what is not allowed to have happened, but also what is allo wed to have happened. Not least for the sake of the faithful. Nevertheless, it would not surprise me if the statu s of 'Major miracle' were not attributed to the events at Carabandal in a decade or so. The Church is crafty and does not mind waiting. Sho uld that happen one day, Mari Cruz could say (or leave a deposition in her will) that she had to lie and retract on direct orders from heaven in order to 'test the fai thful'. The other three maidens would be prepared as quasi-saints in their convents; they would pronounce the right words at the desired time. Incidentally, inexplicable miraculous cures continu e to take place at Carabandal as they did before. *** It has occurred to me that there is a contradiction even in the visions examined and checked by the Congregation of the Faith. The Bless ed Virgin continually refers to the power conferred on her by God the Father or her son Jesus Christ. If she has this power and the pressing wish to be more widely worsh ipped by the faithful all over the world, why does she always show herself in isolated places and mostly to poor little creatures who can do so little to carry out her wis hes? Without the help of supernatural inspiration, I can think of a better occasion on which to satisfy her wish for publicity."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 18 When on important church holidays the Pope pronounc es the blessing urbi et orbl (the city [Rome] and the world) to a crowd of several hu ndred thousand in St. Peter's square, television stations transmit this highest a ct of ecclesiastical grace to all five continents. The Pope speaks from the church which w as built over St. Peter's tomb. Could there possibly be a more effective scene for visions, if they really come from heaven and always seek out the elect? Is there not an excellent opportunity for granting the fulfilment of Mary's dearest wish? I cannot savour the kernel of the sweet fruit of vi sion. It is bitter. I cannot accept the idea of the Blessed Virgin, of all people, going ca p in hand for more people to revere and pray to her. Is it 'divine' for her to threaten bluntly that her almighty son will destroy mankind if her wishes remain unfulfilled? D oes this kind of behaviour tally with the generally held ideas of God and his son, o f their almighty power and goodness? What goes on here? Do visions need mystery, in the sense of its original meaning, namely, a secret cult that is only accessible to th e initiate and gives them a personal relationship to the godhead who is worshipped? H. U . von Balthasar has some pertinent words to say on the subject: Wherever man honours the rare, precious and holy, h e removes it and sets it apart: he takes the sacred object away from the gaze of the p ublic; he hides it in the cell of a sanctuary, in the half-light of a sacred room; he m akes use of a fabulous legend to snatch it from the humdrum course of normal history ; he surrounds it with mystery ... (14) Mystery is always good value, that much is certain. The most harmless document becomes worth reading as soon as it is stamped Top Secret. The simple man wants to share in the 'secret', he is driven to belong to a circle of initiates, he wants to be 'in'. Mystery religions, secret societies, secret agents etc. have something uncommonly exciting and alluring about them. Sacred secrets ar e a brilliant invention. The 'mysteries' I am going to mention here can be track ed down. *** The events at Heroldsbach are a classical example o f the dictatorial behaviour of the Roman Church. This story could have been invented b y Agatha Christie or Georges Simenon. The village of Heroldsbach is situated in Mittelfranken, Bavaria. 9th October, 1949. The children Marie Hellman, aged 10, Kuni Schleiche r, aged 11, Crete Gugel, aged 11, and Erika Muller, aged 11, were collecting autu mn leaves of different trees for their school botany lesson. On their way home they saw above the treetops radiant handwriting, 'like the sun shining through a green beer bottle', forming the three letters IHS. The writing disappeared. Then 'a white lady who looked like a white nun' appeared, floating above the birch wood. [15] The v ision moved slowly hither and thither."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 19 The sensible children did not lose their heads. To make sure they were not dreaming, they began to count, told each other about noises t hey could hear and ran to the pond on which seven ducks were swimming as usual. No, th ey were not dreaming. The figure of the lady was still floating 'up there' on the hill, higher and higher, until she vanished into the blue sky. The vision lasted for a quarter of an hour. At home no one believed a word of the children's st ory. Their mothers set out to put an end to the phantom by going to see for themselve s. On the hill they observed how the children - 'suddenly' of course - looked fixedl y at the wood. They could perceive the vision again. The mothers could only confirm th at the children were strangely and deeply moved in a way that communicated itself to t hem, too. The records, prepared separately, gave identical descriptions of the phen omenon by the children. 10th October. Kuni Schleicher went to the hill with a girl friend . They were followed by four boys who were teasing them: Andreas Buttner, aged 13, Mi chael Lindenberger, Adolf Messbacher and Heinz Muscha, all aged 12. Then all the children saw the lady only thirty feet away above the treetops and moving slow ly earthwards. 12th October. The little girls saw only a 'white gleam', whereas Michael Lindenberger and his brother Martin claimed to have seen 'a white lady'. 13th October. Antonia Saam (the circle of visionary children was growing) asked the vision: 'What is your wish?' All the children heard the answer: ' The people must pray hard!' The children asked the village priest Gailer to acc ompany them to the hill. The priest refused and informed his religious superiors, the e piscopal administration at Bamberg. 16th October. Herr Kummelmann, sent by the cathedral chapter, was able to observe the children in their visionary ecstasy. In the months and years to come the visions were re peated and the number of those who claimed to have seen them also multiplied. The recorded dates are: 13th January, 1950, 5,9,17 and 18th February, 4,16 and 25th May, 15,16,24,25 and 26th June, 10th July, 7 and 8th October. Visions took place with co nsiderable frequency right down to the last phenomenon on 31st October. Then peace cam e to Heroldsbach. Did it really? We shall see. The figures in the visions were not always the same . Sometimes the Blessed Virgin, with or without the infant Jesus, sometimes promine nt angels, sometimes the Trinity and sometimes even father Joseph were sighted. At C hristmas 1949 the story of Christ's birth is supposed to have unfolded before the children's eyes like a film. What have the representatives of the Holy Ghost mad e out of Heroldsbach? A modern Inquisition. 30.10.1949. The faithful received a warning not to go to the scene of the vision from the Episcopal administration at Bamberg."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 20 10.1.1950. An announcement from the pulpit said tha t the Episcopal examination had produced nothing to justify the assumption of visio ns of supernatural origin.

By Episcopal decree all ecclesiastics were forbidden to participate or coll aborate in religious events if they were connected with visions. 6.3.1950. Archbishop Dr. Kolb summoned the village priest Gailer and forbade him to visit the scene of the vision in the future. 2.10.1950. The Archbishop received a letter from th e Holy Office dated 28th September. It said: Furthermore the Holy Office approved the steps your Excellency (Archbishop of Bamberg) has taken in this matter, and praises the clergy and the members of Catholic Action, who have conscientiously observed the Archb ishop's instructions. The remainder of the faithful who have opposed the deci sion of the ecclesiastical authorities up to the present, are exhorted to comp ly with them ... We also ordain that praying on the hill is tantamount to recognizing th e authenticity of the visions and therefore must cease ... 12.10.1950. The ecclesiastical authorities requeste d that devotions on the hill, which had been taking place for some time without priests being present, should cease. 4.8.1951. Gailer, the grey-haired parish priest, wh o had looked after the parish of Heroldsbach for thirty-eight years and was loved by his parishioners, was transferred with immediate effect because he supported the auth enticity of the visions. Eight years later he returned to his parish as a corpse. 15.8.1951. A new decree by the Holy Office was publ ished. On Wednesday 18th July, 1951, Their Eminences, the Right Reverend Cardinals, who are entrusted with the highest guardianship in matt ers of faith and morals, have decided as follows after examination of the records and documents at a plenary session of the Highest Congregation of the Holy Off ice: It is established that the visions under consideration are not supernatural. T herefore the cult connected with them is forbidden in the above-mentioned place and else- where. Priests who take part in this forbidden cult in future, will be immediate ly suspended from carrying out their priestly duties. On the following Thursday, the 19t h of the same month and year. His Holiness of divine providence, Pope Pius XII, appro ved, ratified and ordered the publication of the decree of Your Eminences present ed to him at the customary audience granted to His Eminence, the Assessor of t he Santum Officium. Given at Rome, at the Palace of the Holy Office, on 25th July 1951. 22.8.1951. After examining them like an inquisitor the acting priest Dr. Schmitt excluded the visionary children from receiving the Holy Sacraments and ordered them not only to stay away from the hill, but also to as sert in future that they had never seen the Blessed Virgin. Out of fear of the Curia the ch ildren stayed away from the hill for five months, but in spite of that they did not rece ive the Sacraments."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 21 15.5.1955. The judgment in a case brought by the Ep iscopal administration ordered the compulsory clearance of the hill (statue of Mar y, small altars etc.). 4 - 6.2.1957. A case was held in the county court o f Forchheim in which Paul Schneider, a retired government servant, was the de fendant. In 1954 he had published a treatise on the subject of Heroldsbach. [16] The Episcopal administration again appeared as plaintiff in this action. Among the wit nesses were some of the visionary children, who were seventeen and eighteen years old by then - 1957. They confirmed the visions they had seen in the years 1949-1952. I should mention that on 8th December, 1949 Herolds bach was the scene of a solar miracle that was observed by 10, 000 people. The pa rish priest Gailer stated in evidence: The sun came towards us, making a loud crackling no ise. I saw a crown of roses five inches wide inside it. Antonia Saam saw the Blessed Virgin and child inside the sun. There were five of us priests up on the hill. I sha ll testify to this as long as I live. Dr. J.B. Walz, Professor of Theology, gave this des cription [17]: It grew lighter and lighter and more dazzling. The sun seemed to become more blinding and bigger and to be coming nearer us. I f elt blinded. I had the overwhelming impression of something quite abnormal and also fel t that something awful was going to happen at any minute. I was terrified ... Then t he sun began to turn very quickly on its own axis and the rotations were so clearly visi ble that it seemed as if a motor was turning the sun's disc at a regular speed. During t his process it took on the most wonderful colours. *** I can give the Holy Office a helping hand with doze ns of cases of visions which are less documented than the one at Heroldsbach and wer e observed by fewer spectators, but have long been recognized as 'genuine'. It obviously depends on the type of report made by the competent ecclesiastical authorities, and such reports are not free of error s, in spite of the charisma of the people composing them. What did the authorities in Bamberg say when they wrote to Rome? Were the visionary children insubordinate bec ause they did not always describe the same vision? Because they had the whol e of the Holy Family parading above the treetops? Or were there messages which di d not synchronize with the holy doctrine at the end of the secret record? As secret s are traditionally better kept in the Sanctum Officium than in the worldly ministries and chanceries, even without a 'top secret' stamp, we shall never know. Rome is right. Although in other cases a tiny back door is always left open so that the verdict can be revised for the good of the Church, the door was slammed tight in the case of Heroldsbach after Pope Pius XII was sanctif ied. Cuius regio, ejus religio! (A man must profess the religion of the prince in whos e state he lives!) A well tried Roman maxim ..."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 22 After studying hundreds of official records of visi ons it becomes quite clear that the Catholic Church claims the exclusive right to recog nize or reject these phenomena, regardless of the fact that the visions have been a nd still are seen by people of all races and religions. But according to its decree ne ither the Blessed Virgin, nor the Lord Jesus Christ, nor the archangels are free to a ppear to anyone they want. Even the visionaries themselves are not allowed to judge of the authenticity of what they have observed. (It is rather like when the Church joins in the discussion about birth control. It is not concerned personally!) The Catholic Church derives its claim to be the sol e authority which can recognize the 'authenticity' of the phenomena, from its teaching mission. For example, if the Blessed Virgin gives a message in a vision that does not co rrespond to the official doctrine the vision is classified and rejected as 'not authentic ', and hushed up or forbidden, as if it had never taken place. But if someone who does not believe in the only tru e faith has a vision, the poor haunted character can only submit to psychiatric tr eatment... or he must become a Catholic as quickly as possible. Rudolf Kramer-Badoni, writer and Catholic asks: 'Sh ould the Church behave like a club and issue statutes that must be accepted by ev ery member when he joins?' The arrogance of the ecclesiastical authorities is painful to behold. Thou art not allowed to have seen anything that is not ordained and approved - thou art not allowed to have heard messages whose content is not officia lly blessed. And then there is the perpetual enlightenment of the charismatic gentleme n by the Holy Ghost, the unassailable chief witness for everything! Here is another quotation from Kramer- Badoni's book Die Last, katholisch zu sein (the Bur den of Being a Catholic): Has the Church the right to call on the Holy Ghost as witness for every legal decision? How then does traditional rubbish continue to accum ulate that must constantly be cleared away (to make room for fresh nonsense)? It would be a terrible omission in a summary of his torical and present-day visions if two world-famous ladies, Katherine of Siena and the Maid of Orleans, were left out. The visions of these maidens occupy a special posit ion over and above the relevant religious phenomena, because both ladies had a prof ound effect on politics that was directly connected with their visions. The maxim of the Jesuit Father Hermann Busenbaum (1600-1668) from his book Medulla theolog iae moralis (Of moral theology) was already valid: 'Cum finis est licitus, etiam media sunt licita': ( 'When the end is allowed, the means are allowed, too'). The Church's strategy is admira ble: it is especially impressive in retrospect. *** In the thirteenth century, Siena, a city in Tuscany , Italy, was at the height of its political power and in the fourteenth century, when Katherine was born, at the peak of"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" 23 its artistic flowering. Siena was the rival of Flor ence, until it was conquered in 1559 and reduced to the provincial centre of the rich fa rming country around. Katherine was born circa 1347, the twenty-third or twenty-fourth child (she had a twin sister) of the master-dyer Benin-casa. At the age o f seventeen she entered the Tertiary Order of the Dominicans, who did not live a communa l conventual life but followed their own rules of Caritas. She lived, so it was sa id, 'entirely in her mystical contemplations'. In the book Katharina von Siena - Politische Briefe [18], which received the imprimatur of the Bishop of Chur on 6. 12. 1943, it says: Circa 1370 she experienced the 'mystical death' in order to receive from her beloved master her mission to the new life of the apostolat e. In 1357 Katherine prided herself on immediate assoc iation with her fiance Jesus Christ with whom she had exchanged hearts and whose stigmata she had received. The story goes that even as a child she was differe nt from other girls. Scarcely had she come to the age of reason when the Lord appeared to her, wearing the papal robes and crowned with a tiara. He stretc hed out his hand towards her in blessing. This image stamped the unity of Christ an d Church indelibly on her heart, from then on she saw in the Pope the epiphany of 'C hrist on earth.... ' When I hear of such a useful start on her pilgrimag e through life, Psalm 4 (German version), occurs to me: 'God leads his saints in a wonderful way', but I should like to change the text to 'The Church leads its saints in a wonderful way!' It was the purely mystical period of her youth, cul minating in the mystical death, the great turning point of her life. For four whole hou rs people thought she was dead. During this time the Lord showed her the holiness o f the saints ... Katherine hastened through Siena in a white wool ro be with a black cloak draped round it. Her visions and ecstasies had been bruite d abroad. She was well known in the town. She had an irresistible influence with he r 'compelling eyes'. Miracle after miracle took place in her presence. The people made pilgrimages to her. From 1374 people testified to 'her coming universal mission', which at first consisted of dictating fiery committed letters -'political le tters' - to kings and queens, popes and bishops (she only learnt to write in the last years of her life). She was a passionate advocate of participation in the Crusades: 'God wants it and I want it.' As we can see, Katherine was no model of Christian humility and modesty. Her activities, which were ostensibly inspired by relig ious motives, had political effects in reality. Pope Gregory XI (1370-1378) lived in exile with the papal government in Avignon. Urged on by the mission given her in a vision, Kath erine wanted to bring the Pope"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 24 back so that he could maintain the unified power of the Church and rule it once again from its spiritual home, i.e. Rome. She enlisted sy mpathy for her ecclesiastical-cum- political mission in the castles of powerful nobles and among everyone she credited with worldly power. She also travelled 'to the bril liant worldly court of the Popes at Avignon ... Katherine was first and always the favo ured mystic ... Only from that starting point is it possible to understand her pol itical missions ...' A dubious bit of whitewashing! For one long year Katherine fought bitterly for the return of the Pope. In 1377 she achieved her goal. Rome was Rome again, the church at the seat of its power. While people constantly and all too clearly emphasi ze her credulous naivety and quote her visions as first-class references for her political commitment, they wrap the political tool Katherine of Siena in so much cotton wool that we completely lose sight of her. It may be that visions cannot be proved; bu t ecclesiastical and political power achieved by them can. That is something we should u nderstand, if we are not 'smitten with blindness' (Genesis 19:11). *** Then there was the no less politically active peasa nt girl Joan of Arc, who became a world star among visionaries. She was born between 1410 and 1412 in the village of Domremy on the Maas in eastern France. Today Domrem y is called 'Domremy-la Pucelle' (la pucelle = the virgin), and has about 2 80 inhabitants, all eager to show tourists the house in which their famous saint was born. The peasant girl from Domremy - known in literature as Jeanne d'Arc, St. Joan or the Maid of Orleans, the central figure of many great d ramas - intervened in major European politics, claiming that she was instructed to do so by visions. At the age of thirteen Joan had her first visions a nd heard voices. Statements by the martial maid at her trial are preserved in the 'Man uscripts of the Royal Library'. [19] 'At the age of thirteen I heard a voice in the gard en of my father at Domremy. It came from the right, from the side near the church and w as accompanied by a great brightness. At first I was afraid, but I soon reali zed that it was the voice of an angel, who has accompanied and instructed me ever since. I t was St. Michael. I also saw St. Katherine (of Siena!) and St. Margaret, who spoke t o me, exhorting me and guiding all my actions. I can easily tell by the voice whet her a saint or an angel is talking to me. Usually but not always it is accompanied by a b right light. Their voices are soft and friendly. The angels appeared to me with natura l heads. I have seen them and I still see them with my own eyes ...' After five years when Joan was looking after the ca ttle, a certain voice said: 'God has pity on the French people and you must go forth to save them. ' When she began to cry, the voice ordered her to go to Vaucouleurs whe re she would find a captain who would lead her to the king without hindrance ..."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 25 'Since that time I have done nothing that was not a consequence of the revelations and visions I have had, and even throughout my actual t rial, I am only saying what I have been inspired to say ...' At the siege of Orleans Joan predicted the capture of the town and also that she should shed blood from her breast. On the following day sh e was wounded by an arrow that went 'six inches deep' into her shoulder. In constant communication with her voices, Joan was summoned to political activities two or three times a week. Towards the end of 1428 the orders were so specific that they charged the young girl to bring help to her co untrymen immediately: she was to end the siege of Orleans by the English. It was all right for the voices to give orders, but it was a difficult political task for a peasant girl, for France was split into two parties . There was the Orleans party under the feeble Dauphin (title of the heir to the French throne), whom Joan crowned King Charles VII in 1422 at Rheims. There was also the B urgundian party under Henry V which was allied with the English. The maid was driven by her permanent visions as if by the Furies. In her peasant rags she easily overcame the courtiers with her ready wi t and forced her way into the presence of the infantile Dauphin, whom she harangu ed at such length that he appointed her 'Chef de Guerre'. At the head of 40,000 warriors Joan forced the Engl ish to withdraw from Orleans. This victory brought the turning point in the Hundr ed Years' War between France and England. Joan's remaining political wish, a reunite d France, Orleans and Burgundy, could have destroyed England, but it was frustrated by the weak king. Once again the valiant maid set forth to do battle, but she was taken prisoner by the Burgundians near Compiegne. 'Her' simpleton of a ki ng left her to her fate. The Burgundians sold their prisoner to the English for a great deal of money. (Saints have their price, tool). They had had such unpleasant ex periences with the maid that they wanted her in their power on pragmatic political gr ounds, regardless of the cost. They knew that France would no longer have a force to dr ive her to unity without Joan (and her visions!). The English regarded their prisoner of war as a magician. For safety's sake they put the maid in an iron cage! The trial began on 21st February, 1431, under the B ishop of Beauvais. The records [20] show that Joan's visions and voices were an es sential part of the evidence. 22nd February, 1431 - a castle at Rouen. The cross-examiner: when did you first hear voices? Joan: I was thirteen years old when a voice from God ran g out to help me to live righteously. The cross-examiner: Did the voices often haunt you?"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 26 Joan: Two or three times a week they said to me: 'Thou s halt leave your village and go to France.' The cross-examiner: What else was revealed to you? Joan: I was told that I should raise the siege of Orlean s ... The vision gave Joan what was clearly a political t ask! When they threatened her with torture on 28th March in order to sentence her as a heretic, she abjured her visions. Joan: Since the Church asserts that my visions and revela tions are unbelievable and cannot be supported, I do not wish to insist on the m. On 2nd April she retracted the recantation that had been wrung from her: The Bishop: Have you heard the voices of St. Katherine and St. Margaret since Thursday? Joan: God told me through the blessed ladies what misera ble treason I had committed when I abjured and recanted in order to save my lif e. On 30th May, 1431, lay executioners set fire to the stake with the tacit approval of the Christian judges. Joan died crying 'Jesus! Jesus!' Twenty years later a court usher stated in evidence that Joan's heart had remained undamaged, although the rest of her body was comple tely destroyed. It is no use puzzling or making far-fetched interpr etations, the figures in Joan's visions wanted to achieve political goals. What kind of int erest could the 'blessed in heaven' have in them? In 1456 the Church saw its chance to lead both a sa int and a national heroine back into the fold. The Church set aside the verdict tha t had brought their co-religionist to the stake. She was beatified in 1894 and canonized in 1920. In the Epilogue to Bernard Shaw's St. Joan it says: The Gentleman: On every thirtieth day of May, being the anniversary of the death of the said most blessed daughter of God, there shall be in every Catholic church to the end of time celebrated a special office in commemor ation of her; and it shall be lawful to dedicate a special chapel to her, and to place h er image on its altar in every such church. And it shall be lawful and laudable for the faithful to kneel and address their prayers through her to the Mercy Seat. Shaw used the official text literally. That is the kind of basic revision the Church subjects itself to, when saints are not only saints , but also active political power factors with whom they can advantageously identify themselves. ***"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 27 I have already mentioned that the Roman Catholic Ch urch claims for itself all the visions designated 'genuine' by its courts. This is usurpatory, for there are other large Christian communities and sects who also base thems elves on the Old and New Testaments. These millions of adherents of differen t Christian religions do not consider themselves a lesser breed of Christians, a s second- or third-raters. They, too, champion the 'authenticity' of visions in their rel igious world. Once again, this obstinacy is contrary to all logic . The messages in visions received by Methodists, Baptists, Jehovah's Witnesses, the N ew Apostles, members of the Greek Orthodox Church etc. work the very same relig ious miracles and proclaim the same values - such as faith, prayer, good behaviour loving one's neighbour, respecting one's fellow-men, the pro scription of criminal act s - that the Roman Catholic doctrine requires. Why then in the devil's name does the dev il, if only Lucifer can appear to them, achieve such typically Christian aims among t he 'others'? *** The prophet Joseph Smith (1805-1844) founded the Ch urch of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints. During the night of 21st September, 182 3, he had a vision [21]: While I was so engrossed in prayer to God, I percei ved a light shining in my room that increased in power until the room was lighter than at noon, upon which an angel appeared beside my bed, standing in the air, for hi s feet did not touch the ground. He was dad in a loose robe of extraordinary whiteness. He was whiter than anything else I have ever seen, nor do I believe that anything te rrestrial could be so exceptionally white and brilliant. His hands were bare and so wer e his arms until just above the wrist. His feet were also unshod, and his legs unti l just above the ankles. His head and throat were also bare. I could see that he wore not hing else besides this robe, for it was open and I could see his breast.... He named me by name and told me he had been sent to me as a messenger from God and that he was called Maroni; God had work for me to do ... He said that a book was preserved writ ten in gold plates which gave an account of the earlier inhabitants of this continen t and their origin; it also contained the fullness of the eternal gospel as proclaimed to those former inhabitants by the Saviour ... After these pronouncements I saw the li ght in the room slowly shrinking around the man who had spoken to me, and this conti nued until the room was dark again, except around him. Then I could suddenly see into heaven as if through a shaft of light and the visitor rose up until he disappear ed entirely and the room was once more as dark as before the vision of heavenly light ... How does the vision in this report differ from the visions approved by the Roman Catholic Church? Joseph Smith had more visions, in which he was shown the gold plates, the text of which he transcribed. In this w ay the Mormon Bible The Book of Mormon came into being in 1830. In 1848 the Christi an Mormon community settled by the Salt Lake of Utah, U.S.A ... after lengthy w anderings in the desert, and founded the Mormon State of Utah with the flourishing settl ement of Salt Lake City as its centre. Today the Mormon Church has over a million and a half members, who are scattered all over the world. Mormons really do liv e according to their Christian laws: they are more than a sect that could be dismissed a s a quantite negligeable."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" 28 Who on earth can credibly explain the 'miracle' exp erienced by Joseph Smith except as an 'inspiration', i.e. a vision? Neither the F.B .I, nor a smart private eye knew the place on the unknown hill where Smith was to find t he gold plates containing the Book of Mormon. No archaeologist had ever dug there . The vision led Smith to the hidden treasure, on the contents of which he was to base his religion. No one knew about it, no one had been there before him so no on e could have led the seventeen- year-old there telepathically. However it is logica l that someone somewhere did know about this hiding place, indeed must have put the p lates there. As this great unknown was not a contemporary of Smith, the impulse to sea rch in this spot must inevitably - how else? - have come from people in the know outsi de our planet, people who at some point in time unknown to us had sojourned on t he earth. For those who emitted the energy for the Smith vision must also have been on the hill at some time. Even they can only induce what they know, and they know more about our race and hidden knowledge than we have been able to discover so far . Smith was an instrument of the extraterrestrials. I should be genuinely grate-ful for any other convincing explanation of this phenomenon. The Book of Mormon, which originated from these vis ions, contains such a wealth of historical events, with facts, names and geographic al data, that it could not have formed part of the knowledge of a seventeen-year-ol d boy. As with all visions, there was 'something' here. Th is 'something' needs investigation. It was definitely not a demonstration by the powers of hell, because the results were positive. That would be, to follow the Church Fathe rs, a con-tram tontrariis (fighting opposites with opposites). *** The Coptic Church is the Christian national Church of Egypt, with over a million believers. It is led by the Patriarch of Alexandria , who has had his seat at Cairo since the eleventh century. On 2nd April, 1968 passers-by observed figures like white doves, which had fluid outlines and slowly met in a mist, above the domes of the old Coptic church in the Cairo suburb of Zeitun. In a ghostlike metamorphosi s the mist assumed the aspect of a human figure. It was so radiant that the spectators were blinded and could only follow the phenomenon with their eyes screwed up. The visi on showed itself at the same place in the same way on other evenings. The Coptic Patriarch Kyrillos VI at once convened a commission of priests, scholars and lay members of the Coptic community. This commi ssion, along with thousands of Cairo citizens - Copts, Moslems, Hindus, Christians of all shades, members of sects - declared that they had seen a 'beautiful lady' radi ating light above the domes of the church. That was six years ago. On the evening of 1 2th April the Egyptian photographer Wagih Rizk Malta, on the hunt for a se nsation, took the first snapshot of a vision of Mary in the sky. On 14th April the Patr iarch produced the photograph at a press conference. It showed a dazzlingly white shap e with an unidentifiable figure against the background of the three domes near the lower edge of the picture above the church roof. Numerous witnesses confirmed havin g seen a 'beautiful female figure', by signing a document to that effect. [22]"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" 29 *** I had been to Lourdes and Fatima. On my journeys ac ross the continents, there was not a single place of pilgrimage in which I had not observed the environment and history of the 'miracle' with critical attention. B ut I had never had the privilege of being the neutral spectator of a 'sudden' vision or of talking to an active male or female visionary. Then reports of the works of 'Mam a Rosa' began to arrive regularly on my desk. 'Mama Rosa' is considered to be a visio nary. Was this a chance to fill in a gap in my knowledge? On 22nd March, 1974 I visited the godforsaken hole of San Damiano. It was not easy to find, for there is no signpost to show the way. I soon realized that signposts are unnecessary here, as everyone you ask knows the far m of the Quattrini family on which 'Mama Rosa' lives and works. (San Damiano lie s south of Piacenza and Piacenza south of Milan. ) Pilgrims from every coun try under the sun find their way here, as a park full of cars of every make, with nu mber plates of every nationality, proves. The monotonous sound of the rosary being recited ca me from a window of the farmhouse: 'Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is w ith thee, blessed art thou among women ...' The pilgrims muttered the responses rhyt hmically. The south wall of the farmstead was covered with vo tive tablets (offerings dedicated to a saint at a pilgrimage shrine): Maria has helpe d! Cured of severe illness! Thanks for all eternity! I am healthy again! Passed my exa mination! None of the languages I know are missing from these ex votos. 'Mama Rosa' m ust indeed be able to work miracles. I had come to the right address. In one part of the yard long rows of red oil lamps flickered on iron shelves. Behind them on a table stood the large plastic bottles wit h 'miraculous water' from San Damiano. It is given away free: nothing is sold at Mama Rosa's. Devotional objects and souvenirs are on sale in the few shops in the v illage. A white statue of the Blessed Virgin sat with invit ing demeanour, a rose in each hand, framed with flowers, behind an iron grille on a sto ne plinth, locked up like a rare animal in the zoo. To the right was a pew, behind i t a 'cloister'. Figures in a plastic tunnel represented the Stations of the Cross. Here and in front of the statue pilgrims knelt on the cement floor, their faces turned to th e grille. A farm woman in a shapeless dress met me. She was a bout fifty years old. Judging by the photographs I have seen, she could be Mama Rosa 's sister. I addressed her: 'Excusa, signora ... I have come a ll the way from Switzerland to ask Mama Rosa a few questions.' 'No, no! That's not pos sible. Mama Rosa has to pray now.' 'It doesn't matter, I'll wait an hour or two or come back in the morning. I'm a writer and I'm interested in visions of the kind Ma ma Rosa ...' In a fury she literally spouted at me: 'Mama Rosa cannot talk to you, she's ill, she's really ill ...' I was persistent For a fraction of a second the idea flas hed into my head of trying a few lira notes, which open the thickest doors elsewhere in I taly. I did not do so; after all I am at a miraculous spot. But - I am getting no further ."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" 30 Before I went there, I knew from publications [23] what was supposed to happen at San Damiano and what made Mama Rosa a magnet for be lievers in miracles. On 29th September, 1961 Mrs. Rosa Quattrini was dou bled up with pain in her bed. She was due to have a hernia operation on the follo wing day. She had already had three children by Caesarean operations. The eldest was studying at the seminary at Piacenza, the little ones were looked after by Aunt Adele. Money was always scarce in the house. On that parti cular day they had scraped together 1, 000 lire to take to the hospital. Aunt Adele was cooking a meagre repast in the kitchen when a young lady knocked at the door. She asked for a generous gift for the Church of Santa Maria della Grazia in San Giova nni Rotondo where miracle- working Father Pio was active. Aunt Adele, to whom money was as 'sacred' as it is to all poor people, asked Rosa what she should say to the suppliant. Rosa spontaneously handed over half the money, the stranger approached the sick woman to thank her and encouraged her to stand up. Finally she pulled Mrs. Quattrini gently out of bed: 'My daughter, you are cured!' The pain seemed to vanish as if by magic. The operation did not take place. The young lady recommended Mrs. Rosa to visit Fathe r Pio. Having recovered in this miraculous way, she travelled to San Giovanni Roton do where Father Pio, to whom long-distance cures were also attributed, advised h er to start caring for the sick, as far as her family duties allowed her. For three years life on the farm at San Damiano fol lowed its usual course. On 16th October, 1964 Mrs. Quattrini was talking to a neighbour in the orchard. Both ladies 'suddenly' - how could it be otherwise? - no ticed a strange little cloud, like a veil of mist, enveloping the branches of the plum t ree. Then the remarkable shape floated over to the pear tree and there a radiantly bright female figure with the two obligatory roses in her, hand and a crown on her he ad showed herself in the cloud, which seemed to solidify. The lady threatened: 'I h ave come to admonish the world to pray, for the Day of Judgment is at hand!' The craf ty Rosa asked: 'How will anybody believe a poor woman like me?' The Madonna answered distinctly: 'Fear not, I shall give a sign. I shall make the pear tree blossom!' T he vision faded. In October the tree still bore a basketful of ripe pears, but -as far as anyone could see - not a single flower bud. And yet the tree blossomed ; not slowly, but - as eyewitnesses claimed to have seen - from one minute to the next. The miracle was repeated on the following day on the damson tree. Since the trees flowered in that autumn, visions ha ve never ceased for Rosa Quattrini. Nearly every Thursday Mama Rosa speaks to the Bless ed Virgin and receives instructions and messages, communications for speci fic persons and threats for those who are not of the right faith. I strolled through the orchard and the courtyard. F rom a window of the farmhouse came the noise of prayer: 'Blessed art thou among w omen and blessed is the fruit of thy womb! Two French priests in full ceremonials kn elt in front of the grille guarding the statue of Mary."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" 31 Mama Rosa does not make things easy for Rome. The m essages ostensibly received from Mary are contradictory, naive often tyrannical and sometimes larded with harsh threats. The records prove that all her loquacious chatter could scarcely arise from contact with any kind of divine inspiration. Nevert heless, miraculous cures take place at San Damiano, so it is said. Hundreds of witnesse s have experienced two solar miracles there. The Church still remains aloof. On 16/17th November , 1970 the Osservatore Romano published an announcement by the Bishop of Piacenza : The ostensible messages, visions and miracles have no connection with the supernatural... Rosa Quattrini has daily and public ly refused to obey her bishop. We hereby formally advise Rosa Quattrini that we are f orced to deny her the sacraments, as well as access to the church ... The Priest Edga rdo Pellacini, former Parish priest of San Damiano, received in his decree of removal from office approved by the Holy See the formal charge not to concern himself furthe r with the so-called 'happenings at San Damiano' ... In addition we warn all other memb ers of the church and responsible persons... both priests and laymen... against sprea ding reports of ostensible visions of the Blessed Virgin and messages from her and organi zing journeys to the spot ... otherwise we are forced to forbid them access to th e Church and the sacraments.

I had been watching h im for hours and he smiled at me. The hypnotic sound of Ave Maria being recited was e verywhere: 'Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. ' I spoke to the Capuchin. I was still hoping to have an interview with Mama Rosa. Perhaps the pious man could help me: he behaved as if he was at home here. 'No, you cannot see Mrs. Quattrini, she has to pray. What pa per do you write for? What did you say your name was? ... No, no one can visit her , she doesn't receive anyone, she is talking to the Madonna.' 'Rome,' I said, 'is very o bviously keeping its distance from San Damiano.' The Capuchin shrugged his shoulders, as if to say: 'Of course, but ...' He meant that that was the normal attitude the chur ch would adopt; when all is said and done they would have to wait - for years or dec ades. In that case what was the ecclesiastical observer d oing here? I had been watching him for hours. From whom or what was he supposed to be protecting the old lady, who he said was talking to Mary? She was closely guarded.. .. When I finally gave up, I heard again the monotonous praying which hung over the co urtyard like an enervating curtain of noise. Without a break. 'Who arose from the dead - who ascended into heaven - who sent us the Holy Ghost ...' For six whole hours it ground out as if unreeled by a prayer wheel. Suddenly I had rather an unkind thought. Was someone in the house playing a tape over and over again?"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" 32 The Capuchin was quite right. People would wait. Fo r years. For decades. For a century. Only then would 'Mama Rosa' from San Damia no do her bit in confirming the one true church by joining the army of the sain ts. I should love to be able to thumb through the list of saints, if there still is such a thing, in one or two hundred years' time. I would probably find 'Mama Rosa's' name perpetuated in it. *** Ecclesiastical scholars such as the historian and h agiographer Walter Nigg [24] are cultivating the ground in which saints can grow and miracles flourish: Saints personify the Christian existence, they are the best teachers of intercourse with God, and they led us directly to the burning bush. There is nothing more vivid and alive than the saints; they are exemplary men who h ave God before their eyes as if they could see him. I have made a summary of characteristic cases of vi sions with the spectrum of their potentialities. Should we agree with Franz Werfel, author of the novel about Lourdes The Song of Bernadette? 'For the believer an explan ation is unnecessary, for the non- believer an explanation is impossible.' Is it reall y? So many visions have been confirmed in Christian co untries alone and so many documented in our century that the reactions and ju dgments of many scholars merely bewilder me. That which is at first incomprehensibl e and indefinable, that which is not measurable or physically recordable, does not e xist. Rationally it can only be a question of mumbo-jumbo and that is something no on e talks about. People should not make it so easy for themselves. After studying mountains of documents, it is absolutely clear to me that subjectively perceived visions have taken place. At the very moment I am writing on 17th April, 1974 someon e is probably having a vision somewhere in the world. The part played by imagination due to religious 'en thusiasm', the effect on what is subjectively experienced of environment, upbringing and outside influences, these are things that call for investigation. The negative po int of view of those who deny everything that is not measurable is no longer cons onant with present-day research. It may be attractive to be witty about phenomena wh ich one does not understand or even try to understand in order to provide small ta lk at parties. The task of proposing new themes, phenomena and problems for research is left to bolder spirits than mine. Inquiry and rationalization can suggest hypothetica l explanations of the phenomena of visions, but one thing we can definitely prove is w hich causes of visions can be excluded. Let us begin with the 'Holy Scriptures'."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" 33 Chapter Two - Who Really Speaks Through The Bible? - Are The Original Texts 'God's Word'? More than a hundred thousand million people in this world call themselves Christians. What is it that ties them to their creed? A common basis is necessary for the purpose. That basis was and is the Bible. The word Bible comes from the Greek: ta hiblia. boo ks. Under the entry 'bible' in the dictionary it says: 'Book of books, Holy Scriptures , the collection of writings which are regarded by the Christian Church as documents o f the divine revelation, God's word, and as binding in faith and life ...' Against their better judgment, the churches proclai m that the Bible is 'God's word'. To the ears and simple heart of the humble Christia n this proclamation from the anointed tongues of theologians sounds as if God in person had inspired the Book of Books and/or dictated it, and as far as the New Tes tament is concerned he is left to believe that the companions of Jesus of Nazareth to ok down his speeches, rules of life and 'prophecies' in shorthand, observed his miracle s at first hand and soon afterwards noted the miraculous events down in a chronicle. Th e Christian then is supposed to accept the Book of Books as a collection of authent ic reports. Professor Hans Conzelmann, Professor of New Testament Studies, Got tingen, admitted that the Christian community really continues to exist becau se the conclusions of critical examinations of the Bible are largely unknown to th em That is not the proper Christian way, but it is true. The Bible is not what it is represented to be and e ven the Holy Ghost is no longer what it was originally supposed to be. I know that my theological critics will raise their eye-brows and say: 'But we know that perfectl y well, you can read it in our theological literature.' They are right. But: the churches, large and small, live among and by the public. They accompany the simple man from the cradle to the gra ve, at important stages of life they make themselves 'indispensable' by their cerem onies, they exercise their power and fill the church coffers in public. So it is qui te unfair to say that all the errors (publicly diffused as the ultimate truth) of religi ous biblical dogma are available (and admitted) in the books of remote theological librar ies. How many of the more than one hundred thousand million Christians ever cross the threshold of one of those libraries? *** Joachim Kahl [l], graduate in theology of Phillips University, Marburg, states: 'The ignorance of most Christians is largely due to the scanty information provided by theologians and ecclesiastical historians, who know two ways of concealing the scandalous facts of their books. They either twist reality into its exact opposite or conceal it.' I call both methods cheating the faith ful."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" 34 The layman has a right to be liberated from erroneo us Christian dogmas that have long since been superseded; he can, since it happen s in the name of the Lord, demand that he be told the truth in an intelligible way in language without complicated and impossible theological gymnastics. In the Constitution of the Council on the Church on 21st November, 1964, in the statement of 28th November, 1965 on the relationshi p with non-Christian religions, as well as in the solemn credo of Pope Paul VI of 30th June, 1968, it was once more expressly laid down: that the Catholic Church alone proclaims the infall ible truth, that the Catholic Church is necessary for salvation , that the Catholic Church alone is the true heir of the divine promise, that the Catholic Church alone is in possession of the spirit of Christ, that the Catholic Church alone is entrusted with th e infallible teaching office, that the Catholic Church alone is in possession of the absolute truth. On 18th November, 1965 the Catholic Church proclaim ed solemnly and most officially in the dogmatic constitution: that God was the originator of the Bible, that all parts of the Bible are sacred that all parts of the Bible were composed under the influence of the Holy Ghost, that everything that the inspired composers of the Bible say must be considered to be written by the Holy Ghost and that what is taught i n the Bible is accurate, true and without error. So that they can defend this exclusive property to the vast community of believers, Theologists, unaffected by the results of their bib lical research, base themselves on the evangelists, the epistles of the apostles and t he miraculous 'original text' of 'the Holy Scriptures. But none of the evangelists was a contemporary of J esus and no contemporary wrote an eyewitness account. Nothing was written down abo ut Tesus and his followers, until after the destruction of Jerusalem by the Roman Emp eror Titus (A.D. 39-81) in the year 70. And if the year 30 is accepted for the dea th of the Son of God, then Mark, the first author of the Bible, wrote his gospel at leas t forty years after the crucifixion of Jesus. Dr. Johannes Lehmann [2], co-translator of a modern edition of the Bible, says on this point: 'The evangelists are interpreters, n ot biographers; they have not illuminated what had grown dark with the passage of generations, but obscured what was still light. They have not written history, but made history. They did not want to report, but to justify.' The 'original text', so frequently, consulted and s o abundant in theological hairsplitting, do not exist at all. What do we poss ess? Transcripts that without exception originated between the, fourth and tenth centuries A.D. And these transcripts, some. 1,500 of them, are transcripts o f transcripts, and not a single transcript agrees with another. Over 80,000 (!) var iations have been counted. There is not a single page of the 'original texts' without c ontradictions. From copy to copy the"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" 35 verses were understood differently by sympathetic a uthors and their functions transformed to suit contemporary needs. The biblical 'original texts' teem with thousands a nd thousands of easily provable and well-known errors. The most prominent of them the C odex Sinaiticus - written in the fourth century A.D., like the Codex Vaticanus - was found in the Sinai Convent it 1844. It contains 16,000 corrections, which are sup posed to go back to seven correctors. Many passages were altered three times and replaced by a fourth 'original text'. Friedrich Delitzsch [3], author of a Hebrew dictionary and a first-rate scholar, established about 3,000 copying mistakes in the 'or iginal text'. This business of the 'original text' is a symptom o f the sublime art of theological description. Every normal mortal connects the conce pt 'original text' with the very first version, an undisputed and undisputable docum ent. What would the Christian layman say if he was told openly from the pulpit th at an original text in this sense did not exist? It is staggering that the fairy tale of the Bible a s 'God's word' has endured so long - there is no comparison in the 7,000 years of human history. But the fact that the 'original texts,' which teem with contradictions an d falsifications, are still publicized as 'God's word' borders on schizophrenia. I know th at 'falsification is a harsh description, for falsification means nothing more o r less than being intentionally misleading. But even the Fathers of the Church of t he first centuries A.D. agreed that, though they might quarrel about the culprits, the ' original texts' were falsified; they still spoke openly of 'interpolations, profanation, destruction, improvement, corruption, erasing' - but that is long ago and the n as now the hair-splitting does not alter the objective fact of falsification. Christian theologians, naturally enough, do not lik e to hear anyone talk about falsifications. They take the forgers under their b lack wings and whisper about 'conscious alterations', they wrap the correctors i n verbal cotton wool and claim that' they acted in the interests of the true word of God - to which they must have had access long after Christ. Dr. Robert Kehl [4], Zurich, writes in connection w ith the falsifications: 'Frequently the same passage has been \"corrected\" in the opposi te sense by another, depending entirely on which dogmatic view had to be defended in the relevant school. At all events, a completely chaotic text and irremediable confusion has already arisen owing to individual \"corrections\", but even more so to de liberate ones.' And the priest Jean Schorrer [5], for many years spiritual adviser to t he Cathedral of Saint-Pierre, Geneva, came to the conclusion that the theory of the total inspiration of the Bible and the idea that God was its author were untenable: this idea c lashed so fiercely with the most elementary knowledge of healthy human reason and is refuted so clearly by the Bible itself, that it could only be defended by ignorant evangelists and a flock devoid of any kind of general culture. *** In some recent editions of the Bible - for example, in the popular edition of the Zurich Bible - it is at least admitted that some passages were added by a later hand. But even"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" 36 this is only a very hesitant indication of the mass ive manipulation to which the biblical texts have been subjected. In the series D ie Religion des modernen Menschen [6], Dr. Robert Kehl gives a sketch of what really happened. I quote: Most believers in the Bible have the naive credo th at the Bible has always existed in the form in which they read it today. They believe that the Bible has always contained all the sections which are found in their personal copy of the Bible. They do not know - and most of them do not want to know — that for a bout 200 years the first Christians had no 'scripture' apart from the Old Te stament, ana that even the Old Testament canon had not been definitely established in the days of the early Christians, that written versions of the New Testam ent only came into being quite slowly, that for a long time no one dreamt of consi dering these New Testament writings as Holy Scripture, that with the passage o f time the custom arose of reading these writings to the Congregations, but that even then no one dreamt of treating them as Holy Scripture with the same status as the Old T estament, that this idea first occurred to people when the different factions in C hristianity were fighting each other and they felt the need to be able to back themselve s up with something binding, that in this way people only began to regard these writi ngs as Holy Scripture about A.D. 200. In other words, there is nothing there about inspir ation by a spirit, not even by the Holy Ghost. 'God's word' sneaks in as if by a secre t ballot in which black and white balls are used. Those are facts. It would be more c onvincing if the world organizations which claim to be guardians of the ultimate and onl y truth did not limit themselves to dealing with historical facts in discussions that a re dialectically perfect, but unintelligible to a layman. What they should do is use a first-class public relations system to bring the facts to the 'common people' in generally intelligible language! Do they lack the courage of their convictions? Are the y worried lest the business basis, the paid-up capital as it were, be taken away from their 'limited company' if it were admitted that the, Bible is not 'God's word', becau se it cannot be so according to the proven way in which it originated? How long are the leaders of the Church going to per sist in the error that the faithful can be kept in a state of Christian humility and in genuousness? How long do they think they can describe contradictions and falsific ations as 'willed by God', 'for the salvation of the faithful' or inspired by the 'Holy Ghost'? If that is the way facts are treated, what has theological scholarship to do wit h knowledge? Nevertheless theology is allotted a special faculty in the unive rsities: it is financed by the taxpayer, who usually calls himself a Christian. I assume tha t straight-forward scientific knowledge is imparted to the theological students i n these faculties. What kind of distortion takes place between academic teaching an d what is preached from the pulpit? Where does the 'brain-washing' take place t hat caused the facts to be forgotten, and the old song of the Bible as the true word of G od rung out once more from the pulpit? *** It all began with the councils, the assemblies of s enior pastors for dealing with important ecclesiastical affairs. A pre-requisite f or the appointment of an official of the church is that he have ('charisma'. i.e. that h e shares the 'divine gift of grace'."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" 37 Hence when councils with such illustrious members m eet, the Holy Ghost is among them, omnipresent and active. The Assemblies of the first five Ecumenical (which means the whole Catholic Church) Councils of the early Christian world set the stand ards for the doctrine and organization of the new religion. The oldest dogmas, which are still valid today, wer e pro-claimed at Nicea (A.D. 325), Constantinople (381), Ephesus (431), Chalcedon (451 ) and again at Constantinople (553). It is worthwhile taking a quick look at how the Councils came into being and what decisions were taken at them - presumably for all eternity. The first Ecumenical Council took place at Nicea. T he Council was convened by the Emperor Constantine (who was not crowned until he w as on his deathbed, because he wanted to use the rapidly expanding Christian relig ion, with its great potentialities, to strengthen the Roman Empire. When, Constantine pick ed out and convened the 318 bishops for the Council, the background was pure po wer politics, religious concerns taking very much of a backseat. Even the charismati c bishops can have been in no doubt about that, for not only did the Emperor pres ide over the Council, he also expressly proclaimed that his will was ecclesiastic al law. The senior pastors accepted him as 'Universal Bishop', even though he was uncro wned, and let him take part in votes on church dogma as a secular prince. Ecclesia stical and earthly interests entered into an astonishing symbiosis even at that early st age! Constantine was completely ignorant of Jesus' teach ing. He was an adherent of the solar cult of Mithras (ancient Iranian god of light ), who was portrayed on coins as the 'invincible sun' and worshipped until far into the Christian era. When he gave his name to the old Greek commercial city of Byzantium and made Constantinople (330) the capital of the Roman Empire, he had a mighty co lumn erected for the ceremonial opening of the metropolis, with the Emperor and the invincible sun on top of it, forgetting all about Christian humility. Clouds of incense floated in the air and candle- lit processions made their tortuous way through the streets in his honour. Far from abolishing slavery in the Christian spirit of lovin g one's neighbour, the Pontifex ordered that slaves caught pilfering food should ha ve molten lead poured down their throats and allowed parents to sell their children in times of need. What were the ecclesiastical-cum-political decision s that this pasha had a hand in? Until Nicea, the doctrine of Arius of Alexandria th at God and Christ were not identical, but only similar, held good. Constantine forced the Council to proclaim that God the Father and Jesus were of the same essence. This absolutely vital amendment became church dogma by imperial decree. That is how Jesus became identical with God. With this as a foundation, the bishops unanimo usly passed the 'Nicene Creed'. The non-Christian Constantine did the Church anothe r enormous service. Until that time, the place where Jesus was buried had remained unknown. Then, in the year of grace 326, the Roman Emperor, led by 'divine inspir ation', discovered the grave of Jesus, who had just become consubstantial with God. (In 330 Constantine had the Church of the Holy Sepulchre built.) However, this wonderful discovery did not stop"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" 38 Constantine from murdering some of his close relati ves during the same year: his son Crispus, his wife Faustina, whom he had plunged int o boiling water, and his, father- in-law Maximian, whom he imprisoned and forced to c ommit suicide. That is the image of the Emperor and Pontifex who s tage-managed the Nicene Creed and who, when the Council was over, told the Christ ian communities in a circular letter that the agreement of the 318 bishops was th e 'Decision of God'. Incidentally, Constantine the Great was canonized b y the Armenian, Greek and Russian Churches. The second Ecumenical Council was at Constantinople . This council was convened by the Emperor Theodosius I (347-395), who was flat teringly nicknamed 'the Great' by the Church. This Roman Emperor did not lag behin d his colleague Constantine in moral qualities. He was a veritable oppressor of th e poor, so history tells us, who swamped the common people with intolerable burdens, which his tax collectors exacted with brutal tortures. With the full rigour of his imperial power, he forbade anyone to give refuge to any of these downtrodden c reatures who might have offended him. If they did so, he had the inhabitant s of whole villages slaughtered. In the year 390 (i.e. almost ten years after the holy council) he had 7,000 rebellious citizens murdered in a frightful bloodbath in the c ircus of the town of Thessalonika - at the same time as the 'Halleluya' (Praise Yah / Y ahweh) came into use in Christian churches. Theodosius proclaimed the Christian doctr ine the state religion (hence 'the Great') and made Ambrosius, Bishop of Milan raze al l heathen sanctuaries to the ground. With his methods Theodosius could well have been the ancestor of the Inquisition. If Jesus preached a joyous message to the poor and oppressed. Theodosius was Antichrist in person. Yet this 'Unholy Ghost' c onvened the second Council at Constantinople. What happened there? The dogma of the Trinity of Father, Son and Holy Gh ost, was introduced into church doctrine by the assembly of senior pastors known by theological experts as the Rump Council. It was turned into the 'Niceno-Constantino politan Creed'. Thus — something for connoisseurs of the finer points of theology -w as introduced the doctrine of the consubstantiality of Father, Son and Holy Ghost. To day the Church still feeds on the dogma of the Trinity that was added in this way. The third Ecumenical Council at Ephesus was convene d by the East Roman Emperor Theodosius II (408-450) and the West Roman Emperor Valentianus III (425-455). These two emperors did not bother their heads about secular or ecclesiastical problems: they were playboys. So they seldom graced the council with their presence. Theodosius II was a weakling who devoted himself wh olly to his hobbies and tyranically levied taxes from his subjects to pay f or his extravagant way of life. The Emperor was lavish in taking 'what was the Emperor' s'. It is small wonder that he was completely under the influence of his power-obsesse d intriguing elder sister Pulcheria (399-453). For some time she acted as resent for he r brother and boasted of being a virgin (which only made her contemporaries laugh) o n every suitable and unsuitable occasion. Her pious protestation sufficed to get he r made a saint, though this did not"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" 39 stop her, after her brother's death, from having hi s able and successful rival Chry- sophus murdered. As for his West Roman imperial col leagues Valentianus, he was under the thumb of his mother Galla Placidia and ul timately assassinated. What happened at Ephesus? The Council declared, that Mary should be worshippe d as the Mother of God. By inclusion in the 'Theodosian', Codex their decision became an imperial law. Thus one thing followed another, and the Holy Ghost was ever present ... The fourth Ecumenical Council at Chalcedon was form ally convened by the Byzantine Emperor Marcianus (396-457), but in reali ty it was run by the virgin Pulcheria, who had married Marcianus after the deat h of Theodosius. She knew far better than the bishops what she wanted. The theolo gian Eduard Schwartz [7] came to the conclusion that Pulcheria convened and pushed t hrough the Council against the will of the various churches, and held the reins of the deliberations firmly in her hands. What happened at Chalcedon? With his Epistola dogmatica (Dogmatic Letter), Pope Leo I initiated the dogmatic formula that Jesus had two natures. The Council pro claimed the doctrine that divine and human nature are unalloyed and inseparably unit ed in the person of Jesus. This double nature still persists today as the 'Chalcedo nian Creed'. Last, but not least, the preservation of the unity of the doctrine was entru sted to the Pope, who could intervene whenever he saw fit. That is how the prim acy of Rome originated. The foundations for future developments were made offic ial. Today the men in the Vatican must still be grateful to the unholy Pulche ria for pushing through the Council of Chalcedon with her intrigues. The fifth Ecumenical Council was again at Constanti nople. It was staged by the East Roman Emperor Justinian I (483-565). He was no mean despot, but in spite of or because of it he fell in with the whims of his wife and co-regent Theodora (497-548). This daughter of a circus attendant deserved well o f her husband, because she saved the throne during the rebellion of Nika (532), when there was an uprising against the tyrran-nical sovereign. After this service, she was able to give her fanatical will full rein and wipe out the rest of heathendom, a project which the senior pastors of the Council warmly encouraged. The bishops of the Fifth Council had virtually no w ork to do. Anything that Justinian had in mind had been achieved long before by imperi al decrees and laws. It is not unironical to find this assembly described in theol ogical literature as the 'Council of Acclamation'. Justinian summoned Pope Vigilius (537-555) - 'Unwort hy representative of his office', who was later quoted by opponents of papal infallib ility to prove their case - to Constantinople. Vigilius and the bishops submitted themselves to the power-political interests of the Emperor, who found a place in the history books because of his pitiless laws against heretics. Henceforth a 'heret ic' was anyone who denied the Christian dogmas. He was subject to savage punishme nts, and even death. An army of"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" 40 Roman officials tracked down dissenters, rounding t hem up in droves and forcing them to accept Christian baptism on Justinian's ord ers. The Byzantine historian Procopius (circa 490-555) w as author of a History of Justinian's Wars against the Persians, Vandals and Goths, and a book about Justinian's buildings (Hagia Sophia!), but he also wrote a pamp hlet against Justinian and his wife Theodora. Procopius, who presumably knew his noble lord well, described Justinian as proud, hypocritical, unrighteous, malicious, cru el and bloodthirsty. Christian interpreters of history like to deviate from Procop ius's description. Naturally! For Justinian was canonized like the Emperors Constanti ne and Theodosius. What happened at the Council? The Greek ecclesiastical writer. Origen (circa 185- 254), a teacher in the catechists' school at Alexandria, was the most important theolo gian in Christian antiquity and the first advocate of a critical examination of the Bib le. With the help of his Platonic training he had to some extent made the scriptures intelligible and spiritualized them by allegorical interpretations. The Council condemn ed his deviations and said his exegeses were unorthodox. What was to be orthodox i n future was exclusively determined by the leaders of the Church, inspired b y the Holy Ghost. When this decision was taken by the Council, persecution was not confined to Origen's numerous followers; the view halloo! to hunt all th e other dissenters was also sounded. (About this time the ring which bishops wear became a symbol of 'marriage' to the Church. A strange union, in my opinion, between man and Holy Ghost.) The Bible is not 'God's word'. Moreover, the dogmas concocted at the first five councils) by an army of princes of the church are n ot inspired by the Holy Ghost - in spite of the participants' supposed charisma. This comes as a severe shock to the average religious layman, because he is usually unp repared for it. What is left? What is the truth about Jesus? Did he exist? Did he bleed to death on the Cross for our sins? Did he really preach what is recorded in the New Testament? And if the texts put into the mouth of Jesus are not by him, where d id the 1,500 copies of the 'original text' originate from? Something must have happened. One single figure out of many who were crucified could not kindle and support suc h a colossal cult of personality. Clever heads were at work. There are thousands of books about Jesus of Nazaret h. Versions of the story of Jesus based on the latest research have recently been pub lished by authors such as Johannes Leh-mann [8], Joel Carmichael [9] and Rudolf Augste in [10]. Naturally these critics of misleading interpretations of Jesus are contradi cted by the theological party, yet when one analyses the prevarications of the group o f authors [11] writing about Augstein's Jesus Menschensohn, one recognizes only the time-honoured technique that Joachim Kahl called 'camouflage'. Christian theologians make the dogma of Jesus - the established religious doctrine with the claim to unconditional validity, the unpro ved proposition [12] - the salient point of the Christian religion. Even that seems un derstandable, if rash, to me, because the hundreds of thousands of pastors of all the Christian churches would lose"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" 41 their jobs and their personal raison d'etre if they could no longer act in the name of Jesus. To be honest they would have to say to the l ittle man in the seventeenth row of the Jesus of Nazareth was not 'God's only begotten son' and that he himself never pretended that he was. In fact, it would be asking a lot to expect such a pronouncement from the pulpit. What then was the re al Jesus like? Rudolf Augstein [13] asks: '... with what right do the Christian churches refer to a Jesus who did not exist in the form they claim, to doctrines which he did not teach to an absolute authority which he did not confer and t o an affiliation with God which he never laid claim to.' These are no novelties to the initiated, but I am a ddressing the ignorant, the laymen, who neither know nor understand theological double- Dutch. Once again, I am taking it on my broad back to translate professorial wisdo m into generally intelligible language - knowing perfectly well what a sound thra shing by Christian specialists awaits me. It is not in my nature simply to believe 'par ordre du mufti'. The wisdom of theologians has been printed in hundr eds of thousands of books which can be found in archives and libraries. So that eve ryone can understand me, I must begin at the beginning. *** For nearly two thousand years now the Christian has been given an unbearable burden to carry on his way through life: he is inflicted w ith original sin from birth and he needs the 'Redeemer' to free himself from it. We all learnt in school and church that God was the beginning and end of everything, alpha and omega, that God was almighty, infinitely good, all-righteous, omniscient, omnipresent and eternal. So far I accept the concept of God without reservat ions. But because he is eternal God is also timeless: he knows no yesterday, today or t omorrow. Eternal and omnipresent God does not need to await the results of his measu res. He does not need to ask how they are going to turn out, for he already knows th e answer. In my Catholic school I listened attentively to the charming story of how God in his goodness made two harmless creatures a present of a stay in Paradise, the home of joy and happiness. Adam and Eve, the chosen ones, lived a carefree-existence. They lacked nothing and they had no desires or longings. There was only one thing that was strictly forbidden them by God the Father. They mus t not eat of the Tree of Knowledge. It was the first case of 'Off limits'! We are nonplussed. Why did the Almighty make this s trict prohibition? Did he enjoy this kindergarten for the first people on earth? Co uld God share the human happiness which Adam and Eve experienced in the Garden of Ede n, since he, the sublime, stood high above mankind? Why did he want to keep 'knowle dge' from his first-created children?"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" 42 Theologians have an answer. God wanted to 'bestow l ove' on them and wished that they should both 'partake' of his kingdom. For heav ens' sake! According to that interpretation. God is supposed to have yearned for love ... and to have felt lonely. In my opinion, those are not feelings that befit God, for he of all people is boundlessly happy in his omnipotence. An intermediate condition - 'A little love might be nice' or 'It's boring, playmates wouldn't be a bad idea' - d oes not exist for an exclusive God. So what was he trying to achieve with his humans in Paradise? Again, theologians have the answer pat. God wanted to lead Adam and Eve into temptation, he wanted to test them. That doesn't wa sh, reverend gentlemen. What kind of low opinion have they of God? 'Temptation and 't esting' would be mere cardsharper's tricks, since he, the omniscient, mus t have known the results of the temptation beforehand. Now suppose we play with the idea that they did not, having free will, eat the apple. What would have happened if they had not recognized their shameful nakedness - and with it the possibility of procreation? Would God have had to create more and more human beings - on the assem bly-line system? People, who, thanks to their free will, would not have striven f or 'knowledge', because they obediently observed God's ban? God obviously had th e 'Fall' in his calculations, because he was omniscient. Otherwise many countries in the world would not be bursting at the seams with overpopulation today. Adam and Eve did not pluck the apple from the bough casually. There was a tempter. the devil or snake. But every created thing conies from God. At least, that's what we've learnt. So that logically the devil (or snake ) is also a product of God. Was our benevolent God so infamous as to create a devil or snake in order to deceive two innocents? And why is God so shocked after the vege tarian meal to find that from then on sin is ineradicable in his world? HE knew i n advance exactly what would happen. Theologists tug at my sleeve. It wasn't like that! Lucifer, the devil, they say, was a renegade in God's kingdom. A renegade in the kingdo m of heaven? If the 'kingdom of heaven' equals bliss (as we are promised), there ca nnot be any opposition, rebels or renegades in it. Either - or. If God's kingdom guar antees the state of perfect happiness, Lucifer, would certainly not have had the idea of d isobeying God. However, if absolute happiness did not exist there, it was beca use God was not almighty .enough to create such a state. Here, too, there is a weak point in the theologians' argument. They are unable either to dismiss the struggle betw een God and Lucifer or to motivate it logically. Before Lucifer approached the inhabit ants of Paradise to tempt them, God must have known that his devilishness would succeed . And the business of Adam and Eve's 'free will' remains a kind of deus ex machina . Even with the interpolation of Lucifer, the snake, Adam and Eve acted at the will and behest of almighty God. To a man who takes the word that was taught him at its face value, the situation presents itself as follows. God did not live in a p erfect heaven, for there was an opposition in it, Lucifer set to work in Paradise a nd egged on Adam and Eve to commit a sin which God knew was about to happen. Th en the apple was eaten. Then came the crowning episode: (omniscient) God was so offended that, beside himself with wrath, he cursed the innocent descendants of t he first married couple for all eternity and branded the stain of 'original sin' on to the family tree as a ghastly heritage. Everyone born since then carries 'origina l sin' with him from the cradle."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" 43 How can miserable mankind be freed of this burden? Only by a redeemer. The Bible says: 'God so loved the world, that he gave his onl y begotten son ...' Not being overcritical, people accepted this son wh o had cropped up so suddenly, although it is difficult to conceive of the one and only God with a family. This son is to be envied, since he has a 'heavenly' father, ful l of love, goodness and solicitude. That is what one would think, but it is not the cas e. .He is handed over to mankind (suffering under the burden of original sin), so th at he can free his brother and sisters from their burden. The son of God has to be nailed to the Cross and bled to death in agony. After the death of his 'only begotten son' G od is appeased again! Surely this ghastly story contains ideas from barbaric pagan cu lts? This dogma of redemption seems to me to be a kind of throwback to primitive religions which forced their servants to propitiate their wrathful Gods with blo od sacrifices. The crucifixion, theologians assure us, is only to be under-stood symbolically. Why is this not made quite clear in religious teaching? My daughter Lela learns - like all previous generations - that Jesus was the only bego tten son of God made flesh, that he suffered every pain (= the oppressing original sins ) as a man. That he died as a man, struggled as a man, with all the attendant torments and miseries. But how can God, who knowingly let his own son be tortured - because Adam and Eve committed a sin that he could easily have prevented through his for e-knowledge - be reconciled by Christ's death with the very men who killed him? (W ith this macabre end to the story original sin should really have been banished from the world. But it is still about.) Theologians, full of ideas and skilled in dialectic s, recently sought a path which would lead out of this dilemma, but it terminated i n a dead end. They now say that God the Father did not so love t he world that he sacrificed his only begotten son, but that Jesus sacrificed himself of his own 'free will' out of love of mankind. Unfortunately this about-turn does not pro duce any significant conclusion. God the Father and God the Son are unalloyed and in separable, according to Christian dogma (the Nicene and Chal-cedonian creeds). So it makes no difference what one or the other does. Either way the sacrifice remains se nseless. Father and Son were (and are) 'one' from the beginning according to current doctrine. Hence both of them knew what was going to happen at any given moment. As th is does not resolve the contradiction, the ecclesiastical teachers thought up an - absolutely final? - interpretation. Jesus wanted to show mankind how th ey should live in order to please God the Father. Does that bring us back to the beginning again, to zero? If the whole of mankind is supposed to become 'pleasing to God', then the Almi ghty would simply have had to plan that our ancestors Adam and Eve should become so, according to his divine will. That would have been quite within his powers, would n't it? Surely the dogmas of original sin and redemption la ck any kind of foundation when considered in the cold light of reason? Even in the interests of the Christian churches, I consider blood sacrifices and redemption by the crucifixion to be dangerous doctr ines.

His date of birth is unknown. His name is not to be found in any register of births, yet the Christian west bases it s calendar on the ostensible (and accepted) year of Jesus' birth. The first time that his name appears is in one of St. Paul's epistles, about the year 50 of the new era. In the Gospels according to St. Matthew and St. Luk e it says Jesus was 'born at Bethlehem'. St. Mark, on the other hand, names Naza reth as the place of birth. Right from the birth of the Redeemer confusion and contra dictions make the Bible adventurous reading. Mary is universally mentioned as his mother. His fa ther, Joseph the carpenter, is not the physical father, for Mary received the sperm by 'immaculate conception' with the co-operation of the Holy Ghost. That is Christian p opular belief, for reason cannot grasp this process of impregnation. So especially i lluminated theologians take great pains to prove what is meant by 'immaculate concept ion'. According to the official biography, the New Testam ent, the trail of the infant Jesus is lost after his birth until he suddenly crops up aga in in the Temple as a twelve-year-old runaway-in heated theological conversation with sch olars. Unfortunately we never know exactly what is true and what is not, what act ually happened and what forgers invented (original texts!). If it is correct, and that is what I am assuming he re, that the twelve-year-old could tie the clever temple scholars up in theological discus sion, the precocious lad must have been drilled in the Old Testament texts in some con temporary school. What kind of school was available to him? We must r ecall the historical background to find the answer. The territory we call the 'Near East' today belonge d at the time we are concerned with to the gigantic Roman Empire. Damascus was conquere d in 64 B.C. by the famous general Pompeius Magnus (106-48), Jerusalem was tak en in 37 and Egypt became a Roman province in 30. What happened in this century to Caius Julius Caesar in the conquered and occupied territories is not hidden in historic mist. Presumably occupying forces have been made of the s ame stuff in all ages. At all events the Romans brought their way of life with th em and propagated their culture in the occupied countries. The Roman soldiers were no saints: they worshipped Apollo (taken over from the Greeks), the god of poetry, mu sic and youth, emptied their beakers to the health of the god Bacchus (Dionysus) , wooed the goddess Fortuna for luck, implored pity from Jupiter, god of lightning, thunder and justice, prayed to Neptune, god of water, for rain, knelt in devotion before Sol, the sun god. Abomination to any orthodox Jew!"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" 45 For more than 400 years - Ezra compiled the text of the Torah as early as 440 B.C. - the Jewish people had lived according to the Mosaic Law, the Pentateuch and the Torah. And the patriarch Moses said in the law: Thou shall have no other gods before me. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above , or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God. (Exodus 20 :4-5) Moses was a monotheist. When the founder of the Jew ish religion had led the Israelites back into Palestine from Egypt circa 123 0 B.C. he had the legendary tablets with the commandments set up on Mount Sinai. Thus t he recognition and worship of a single god was an old tradition, when the Romans practised polytheism among the Jews. The Jews could do nothing about it. With gnashing o f teeth they lived together with the hated heavily armed occupiers, who, I should re mark in passing, neither encouraged nor forced conquered peoples to worship their gods. Very sensibly, they even gave them a measure of self-government. True, the Temple was guarded by Roman soldiers, but it was administered by Jews. In the forecourts money-changers, merchants with their stalls and artisans in their b ooths carried on their business. So at the time of the Roman occupation, the time of Jesus, the Torah - the basic law of the Jewish state since 443 B.C. -was still the reli gious doctrine of the Jews. The Sadducees, representatives of the conservative religious party, were strict guardians, preservers and teachers of the Mosaic la w. One possible school for the infant Jesus could be sought among them ... The Sad ducees' opponents were the Pharisees, the progressives, who admittedly also ke pt the letter of the Mosaic Law, but who accepted angels and resurrection from the d ead in their teaching. As scribes they gained considerable influence of Judaism at th e time of Jesus with their law schools. Here was a second possible answer to the p roblem of Jesus' schooling. 'If we follow the gospels, Jesus did not agree with the Sadducees or the Pharisees. He often made fun of the 'scribes' and the New Testame nt also states that they did not accept the forward young man as one of their kind. But if Jesus had been a graduate of a Sadducees' or Pharisees school, he would have bee n recognized or expelled as a renegade. Nothing of the kind has been handed down: the name of Jesus of Bethlehem or Nazareth does not figure in any writings by the scribes. The disputatious Jesus must have acquired his knowledge somewhere, else. W here? Was there a. third school? There was, but it has not been common knowledge for very long. Until A.D. 68 the extraordinary conservative frater nity of the Essenes lived deliberately isolated from temple Jewry in a monast ic-like habitat that had been rebuilt after an earthquake. It was situated at Chi rbet Qumran in a fissured"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" 46 mountainous region on the Dead Sea. The 'Army of Sa lvation' traced their origin to a 'Teacher of Righteousness' from the time of the Mac cabees, centuries before Christ. The Essenes concluded their 'New Covenant in order to prepare the Messianic king- dom. The oldest reports about this ascetic sect are found in an essay by Philo of Alexandria (25 B.C. - A.D. 50): 'Quod omnis probus liber sit'[14] Palestinian Syria, inhabited by a considerable sect ion of the very numerous people of the Jews, is also not unfruitful in the production of virtues. Certain of them, more than 4,000 in number, are called Essenes; in my view, al though it is not strictly speaking a Greek word, it is connected with the word 'holiness '; these are in fact men who are quite specially devoted to the service of God; .but they do not make animal sacrifices. They find it more advisable to consecrate their tho ughts. ... They amass neither silver, nor gold, and they do not cultivate large tracts of land because they want to get income from them, but limit themselves to providing _for the necessaries of life. Almost alone among men, they live without goods or property ... nevertheless they consider themselves rich because they rate sufficie ncy and a good disposition as a genuine excess ... They reject everything that coul d awake avarice in them. ... They do not possess a single slave, on the contrary they ar e all free and help each other mutually. ... Thousands of examples testify to thei r love of God ... contempt for wealth and honours, aversion from pleasure ... They have a single fund for all, and communal expenses ... and the custom of communal me als ... nowhere else could one find a better practical example of men sharing the same roof, the same way of life and the same table ... The intriguing nature of the Essene community also struck the Jewish historian and general Flavius Josephus (37-97), who mentioned the m in his books The Jewish War and Antiquities of the Jews. In Chapter 7 of Book I I of The Jewish War [15], he gives details of this religious community which I quote l iterally: Among the Jews there are three schools of thought, whose adherents are called Pharisees, Sadducees and Essenes respectively. The Essenes profess a severer discipline: they are Jews by birth and are particul arly attached to each other ... Scorning wedlock, they select other men's children while still Pliable and teachable, and fashion them after their own pattern. Contemptu ous of wealth ... their rule is that novices admitted to the sect must surrender their p roperty to the order ... When adherents arrive from elsewhere, all local resource s are put at their disposal as if they were their own ... In dress and personal appearance they are like children in the care of a stern tutor. Neither garments nor shoes are ch anged till they are dropping to pieces or worn out with age. ... The priest says gr ace before meat ... After breakfast he offers a second prayer ... (only) two things are le ft entirely to them ... personal aid, and charity ... they champion good faith and serve the cause of peace ...

Their spirit was tested to the utmost by the war with the Romans, who racked and t wisted, burnt and broke them, subjecting them to every torture yet invented to ma ke them blaspheme the Lawgiver or eat some forbidden food, but could not make them do either, or ever once fawn on their tormentors or shed a tear....

Some of them claim to forete ll the future ... rarely if ever do their predictions prove wrong ... Flavius Josephus, who wrote these words in A.D. 77, knew all this about the Essenes, because, by his own account, he himself had lived a mong them for three years. It is highly probable that he also knew the written tradi tions and leather scrolls from about 100 B.C. which the community had packed in jars and hidden in nearby caves during a rebellion that threatened them [66]. This theological bomb with a time-fuse of 2,000 yea rs exploded. In 1947 the original documents hidden by the Essenes, now known as 'The Dead Sea Scrolls' [16], were found by accident in caves at Wadi Qumran. Since th en they have had an unshakeable place in theological historical literature. Heinric h Alexander Stoll has told the whole exciting story of the Qumran texts in the book The Caves by the Dead Sea [l7]. This incredibly valuable Manual of Discipline, already s upplied with commentaries by the Essenes (!), found its way half-way round the world , was appraised in universities and monasteries until it came into the good hands of ob jective scholars such as Professor Andre Dupont-Sommer [18] and Professor Millar Burro ws, after all kinds of intrigues and haggling [19]. The translations of the Qumran Scrolls show quite u nequivocally that vital parts of the Gospels originated from the Essene school: that Jes us' style and way of life followed the customs of the Essenes and that parables, such as Jesus used, indeed whole sermons attributed to him, had been taught by the E ssenes long before him. Textual comparisons of the Qumran Scroll and the Ne w Testament would be recognized and confirmed as clearly tallying with o ne another by any normal court of law - not so by Christian theologians. As if there was something reprehensible about the remarks of Jesus of Nazareth or Bethlehem conta ining the spiritual teachings of the ascetic Essene community! But here Jesus' consu bstantiality with God, ordained in Nicea, stands in the way. The Essenes were simpl e members of an order who had their own doctrine long before Christ Jesus an epig one? Impossible. The Christian guardians of the pure teaching of Jesus find that i ntolerable. Albert Schweitzer [20] obviously did not speak clearly enough when he said : 'Modern Christianity must always as a matter of course reckon with the possib ility of abandoning the authenticity of Jesus.' Here are some examples of clear agreements between the teaching of the Essenes and the teaching of Jesus: The Essenes did not baptize. Neither did Jesus. The Essenes denounced the theologians of their time , the Sadducees and Pharisees. So did Jesus. The Essenes preached meekness and humility to pleas e God. So did Jesus. The Essenes warned of an imminent 'Last Judgment wi th fire. So did Jesus. The Essenes said a man must love his neighbour like himself. That was the leitmotiv of all Jesus' speeches. The Essenes spoke of the 'Sons of Light' who fight against the 'powers of darkness'. Who does not know these metaphors from Jesus' sayin gs? The Essenes preached the 'spirit of truth' and prom ised 'eternal life'. Jesus did so, too."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" 48 The Essenes spoke of 'members of the New Covenant' and the 'Holy Ghost'. What did Jesus do? The Essenes had communal meals preceded by saying g race - like Jesus at the Last Supper. The Essenes spoke of the foundation 'that will not be shaken' - Jesus of the rock (Peter) against which the gates of hell shall not prevail. 'Beatitudes' were found in the fourth Qumran cave t hat begin sentence after sentence with the word 'Blessed' - the opening phrase that J esus used in his Sermon on the Mount. The Essenes required every member who had just ente red their community to confess his sins - an iron law of Christianity. With so many proofs (they are no mere indications), the question inevitably arises whether Jesus, too, did not spend a period among th e Essenes, just like the historian Flavius Josephus. For nineteen Christian centuries clever men puzzled over the accounts of Flavius Josephus: no one knew anything about the Essenes. They are not mentioned in the Gospels or the Acts of the Apostle s.

I still remember perfectly the day when I, as a boa rder at the strict Catholic College of Saint-Michel, Fribourg, first heard Jesus' moving s peech of farewell to his Apostles, in which he announced the 'Last Judgment' to them a nd prophesied that the Lord 'shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on t he left' (Matthew 25:33 et seq.).

Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison and ye came unto me. The Prefect of the College exhorted us to live ever y day in such a way that we stood before God with a pure heart at every moment, becau se we had never doubted his word, because we had always believed God's word, wi thout deviating one iota from the scripture. During the sermon I realized that I would definitel y stand on the left side, for I was full of doubts. How is that, I mused? Is the Prefec t right when he says that God will reward the faithful who have no doubts? Will those who can believe without temptation stand on the right hand side of God? Sim ply because they have always believed? True, the Prefect incessantly based himse lf on God's word, but he had never been present at a heavenly selection board or when the faithful were rewarded! The Prefect might be wrong. For all my doubts I was nevertheless convinced at t he time that Jesus, the Son of God, had coined the wonderful moving words. Today I know that this text, too, originated from the so-called 'Testament of Joseph' [21]. I qu ote: I was sold as a slave, but the Lord made me free; I was taken prisoner, but his strong hand helped me; I was tormented with hunger, but th e Lord fed me; I was alone, but God comforted me, I was ill, but the All Highest vi sited me; I was in prison, but the Saviour blessed me. Is further proof needed that Jesus' words were not born of his 'divine spirit'? They were in religious use long before him. (So far none of the many explanations has interpreted his words as archetypal memories from t he unconscious [C.G. Jung] ... but even then they would not be of divine origin.) To me it seems quite certain that Jesus entered the school of the Essenes and had an extremely profound knowledge of their teaching. In that way the man from Nazareth or Bethlehem would have kindled the torch of Christ ianity from traditional religious genius. Would that be so terrible? Only if the cons ubstantiality of Jesus has to remain the basis of Christian doctrine. We look benevolently on the growing crowds of Jesus people as a sign of youth turning towards the faith. We allow musicals like ' Jesus Christ Superstar' to be performed in church. I do not like to experience my God in make-up, dancing, singing and bawling. My belief in divine omnipotence is too big, indeed quite old-fashioned. It is sacrosanct. This unnatural buffoonery would n ot be necessary if the problem of God's word were answered honourably and with brutal frankness according to the latest state of research. Today conviction is more attractive than belief. *** Jesus came into the world as the illegitimate child of the Virgin Mary in an unknown place. Mary was poor, but wanted the boy to have a good education; she knew that the Essenes accepted other people's children while stil t pliable and teachable. Mary took her child to the monastery school on the Dead Sea. To the Essenes the polytheism of"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" 57 the Romans was blasphemy and the fraternization of the Temple Jews with the occupiers a disgrace. The Essenes decided to streng then the Jewish population in their psychological resistance against the occupiers and inoculate them with hate by means of disguised speeches (parables). In the little set tlements on the Sea of Genezareth and as far as Jericho a maquis came into being, a parti san movement which was mainly fired by John the Baptist, who was a fluent experie nced orator. Jesus was a teachable pupil in the desert: he learnt the methods of mass psychology from the preacher John. At the age of thirty Jesus left the Essene communit y and himself went round the country as a preacher. He chose (undoubtedly not in the simple way described in the New Testament) his twelve disciples. The 'Apostles' were by no means innocent babes in the wood, they were ringleaders of the local maq uis: at least four have been identified as 'Zealots', members of the anti-Roman national party, as dagger-men [22] This bodyguard was so perfectly organized, so eloqu ent and possessed by such missionary zeal that Jesus, as their leader, could risk making an appearance in the city. He camouflaged his speeches, which were in fact pol itical, from the Roman soldiers - in case they understood his language or had an inte rpreter with them - with religious sayings. But the Sadducee and Pharisee theologians also understood his exhortations. Jesus made them nervous, because they fraternized w ith the Romans and were dead set against this itinerant preacher spoiling things for them politically. A tacit gentlemen's agreement existed between the Jewish el ite and the Roman officer caste. The local high society kept its sanctuaries and cou ld continue to use the Temple. Agriculture and trade, as well as trafficking in mo ney, functioned in the traditional way. The Romans merely exacted a tribute, a fairly juicy tax. However it may be, the Jewish leadership did not want this comparatively t olerable status quo upset, it suited them very well. Then Jesus and his bodyguard suddenly appeared in t he busiest places in Jerusalem and made rabble-rousing speeches, even if they were in a religious guise. How could they get rid of this troublesome itineran t preacher? It can be assumed that the citizens knew perfectly well that Jesus was an Essene, at any rate one of those who knew how to wrap their ma xims of a life of humility, righteousness and love skilfully round their politi cal maxims. The Romans on the other hand, did not notice what was going on for a long time. They regarded the Essene preacher as a harmless priest, whose speeche s did not affect Roman interests and sovereign rights. Someone some time - perhaps e ven a top man in the Jewish elite - opened the eyes of the occupying power to what wa s going on. From that day on Jesus was shadowed. It is not clear from the Gospels what happened. A c ommunication to the Roman Procurator of Judaea, Pontius Pilate (26-36), must have been enough to have steps taken against him at once. Had the Jewish high prie st Caiaphas (18-36) given the governor a hint? Had he told Pilate what the pious Essene was trying to achieve with his meek-sounding speeches? Had Jesus and his follo wers stormed the Temple - as Joel Carmichael asserts [23]?"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":" 58 In any case it must have been a case of a political denunciation, for the Romans did not interfere with Jewish religious life. But it is established that it was not a matter of a popular uprising, a rebellion or a revolution aga inst the Romans. That would have been recorded in Roman history. The event must have been comparatively unimportant. However it is also established that Je sus and his disciples had to hide quite suddenly. Why? The Gospels describe Jesus as a gentle man who is r eady to help, whose speeches encourage the pure life, who heals the sick and bri ngs the dead to life. Jesus himself knew that his life was in danger. With his companio ns he withdrew to the Mount of Olives with its three peaks, east of the valley of Kidron, near Jerusalem. The risky game was up. Everyone knows the description of the most dramatic happening in world literature. The Romans look for the Nazarenes, assisted by Jews who know the locality well. The disciples, exhausted by the excitement and effo rts of the last few days, fall into a deep sleep in their hiding-place. Jesus alone is un able to rest; he sweats 'blood'. The flickering light of pine torches throws an eerie li ght on the scene. The shouts of soldiers and the clash of weapons. The rebels are s urrounded. Then Judas Iscariot, an .apostle, steps out of the crowd of persecutors, goes up to Jesus and kisses him. (The kiss of Judas later beca me the embodiment of hypocritical treachery.) A terrible moment. Yet we ought to ask ourselves wh at could Judas actually betray? A peaceable man who was loved by the people? A man who only did good? On top of that, Jesus acted quite openly. The people, the the ologians, the Romans, knew him well. The Romans could have arrested or brought him in for questioning on any day of the week. Why did Judas have to prove the identi ty of the master by a kiss? The Gospels say that Judas had told the priest and elders: 'Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he.' Can we conclude from the identifi cation by a kiss that Jesus was masked and wearing a disguise? It becomes obvious in the nocturnal scene. It says in the New Testament that Peter grabbed for his sword and cut off the ear of Malchu s. a slave of the high priest (John 18:10). Did Peter, one of the peaceful brotherhood, possess a sword? Probably the whole company was armed. Jesus was master of the situation. He realized that resistance was useless and said: 'Put up thy sword in thy sheath.' Jesus was arrested and taken away. The apostles escaped into the bushes through the confused mass of bystan ders and soldiers. Only the aggressive Peter tried to find out what was going t o happen to his master. In disguise, he mingled with the Roman soldiers round their camp fire: Then took they him, and led him, and brought him in to the high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off. And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall and were sat down together, Peter sat down among them."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" 59 But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire , and earnestly looked upon him, and said, this man was also with him. And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not. After a little while another saw him, and said, Tho u art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not. And about the space of one hour afte r another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: f or he is a Galilean. And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest ... (Luke 22:54 et seq.) The fact that Peter was able to stay by the camp fi re among the Roman legionaries for at least two hours shows what a cunning fellow he w as. Jesus was brought before two courts, tried, derided , tortured, found guilty and nailed to the cross. Carmichael [24] has convincingly prov ed that crucifixion was a Roman method of execution: Roman soldiers carried out the crucifixion according to a Roman judgment. Theologians assume that it happened about the year 32. The inscription on the cross indicates that Jesus was e xecuted for a political crime ... as 'King of the Jews' (John 19:19-22). *** To fill out this outline I should add that Jesus wa s a sensitive learned man, who was skilled in medicine and a talented orator, besides having para-psychological abilities. No one can doubt his absolute honourableness and hu mble fear of God, in so far as he is rated as a historical personage. As an Essene or someone who knew the rules of their order inside out, he practised the commandmen ts to love one's neighbour, be continent and help others. But since the appearance of the Qumran Scrolls, we know that the defendants of the Essene doctrine were com mitted opponents of the Romans, for all their love of peace. They wanted to drive t he heathen interlopers and their polytheism out of the promised land. Religious and political interests mingled and that was bound to lead to an explosion at some time. Rel igion and politics have never been a good mixture. I do not want to take sides in the discussion about whether Jesus, as Augstein suspects, was 'an apparition synthetically woven into one fro m several figures and currents'. For, to follow Professor Gunther Bornkamm [25]: 'If we were to reduce tradition critically to what can no longer be doubted on hist orical grounds, all we would have left would be a torso which had scarcely anything i n common with the story testified to in the Gospels.' Here I am only concerned with establishing that Jes us was a devout man, but not 'God's only begotten son', a political activist, bu t not a 'Redeemer'. This proved information will give the literally-minded Christia n a severe shock, because doubt is a sin 'against the Holy Ghost'. Hundreds of millions of Christians have been kept at a primitive stage of religion for two thousand years by a doctrinal system based on false premises, although well informed theologians could have 'proclaimed' the truth long ago. Yet they have kept silent. Two thousand years of false instruction - that's what I call tradition."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" 60 *** Brought up as a Roman Catholic, I am dealing with t he figure of Jesus as we all accepted it in the Christian tradition, even if 'un derstandably ... (we) are so caught in our own tradition, that we can scarcely approach th e Gospels and the New Testament in their totality without prejudice.' (Carmichael.) Faith is defined as inner certainty without regard to proof, an instinctive conviction. People appeal to faith, people demand faith from th ose who do not know. Faith means 'trust'. This appeal, in the sense of belief in a h igher power, in the incomprehensibility of 'Be!' and 'Die!', of the beginning and end of al l being, is good, necessary and eternal. This faith has given consolation and help, blessing and profit to men in all ages. But such faith has not the remotest connectio n with religious insistence on being right. With the fanatical orders 'Thou must!', 'Tho u shalt!', 'Thou shalt not!', Christian pastors and exegetes plunged into the great endless war of the faith. With their stubborn insistence on being the only preachers of the one true word of God, they made a claim with most unfortunate effects. On the other hand it is not true as general opponen ts of the faith say, that 'religion' per se has brought suffering and care on mankind with p ersecutions, tortures, tears and blood. If believers, egged on by Zealots, had made no image of God there would never have been any religious wars. For religion in the spirit of faith in a creative and ordering power does .not claim to proclaim the ulti mate truth, nor does it have multi- purpose bits of advice for sore places, or drivelin g adages for all occasions. Even before the Dead Sea Qumran texts, discovered i n 1947, forced Christian theologians to admit new material to the discussion , critical matter-of-fact men, who wanted accurate knowledge, had discovered irresolva ble contradictions in the New Testament. There could be nothing earth-shaking abo ut that, if it were not God's word or Jesus' word that was supposed to be involved. As father and son are consubstantial (second Council of Constantinople) they are omnisci ent, infinitely wise, omnipresent, without error - in short, infallible. These are the qualifications of the inspired authors which determined the standard by which the Holy Scr iptures are to be judged. Is this high standard justified? The Gospel according to St. Matthew begins with the family tree of Jesus, the son of David, the son of Abraham. (1)* Ancestors are enume rated until 'Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary' (16). What purpose does Joseph serve, since he cannot be the father of Jesus? The fact that his wife was suppose d to be pregnant by the Holy Ghost did not satisfy the simple carpenter, who knew perf ectly well the normal way of bringing children into being. 'Then Joseph her husb and, being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily' (19). An angel in a dream saved their married happiness: Jos eph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is con ceived in her is of the Holy Ghost' (20). Joseph accepted the apparition's message. Joseph's ancestry does not really seem to have been as clear as one would have wished and a certain scepticism as to his being the father of Jesus is hinted at in St. Luke: 'And Jesus himself began to be about thirty y ears of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of E li' (Luke 3:23). Luke ascribes"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" 61 seventy-six progenitors to Joseph (Matthew only 42) . There are obviously considerable difficulties in tracing the family tre e down to Joseph. Modern theologians [26] say that the 'immaculate co nception' should not be taken to mean that Joseph had not touched his Mary. Are they twisting the meaning of the words inspired by God, because the whole process is so implausible? Matthew makes it perfectly clear: 'When as his mother Mary was es poused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child of th e Holy Ghost' (1:18). Nothing could be plainer than that. Matthew expressly states that John baptized Jesus a nd how he did it. John knew whom he was dealing with '... He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose' (1 :27). '... but he that cometh after me is mightier than I , whose shoes I am not worthy to bear' (3:11). John addressed Jesus directly: 'I hav e need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?' (3:14). After the baptism the h eavens opened and the spirit of God descended 'like a dove' and a voice from heaven said: 'This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased' (3:17). John recognized the man he had baptized, who was even identified by heaven as the Son of God: nothin g could be clearer. ---- [*] The figures in brackets refer to the verses quo ted from St. Matthew's Gospel. ---- Herod Antipas (4 B.C. to A.D. 40) took John prisone r and even followed his consort's whim when she urged him to have the Baptist beheade d. John suddenly forgot Jesus in prison and sent two disciples to ask him: 'Art t hou he that should come, or do we look for another?' (11, 3). The impression that the Nazarene - with all his concentrated charisma - made on John during the baptismal ceremo ny seemed so lasting that it is difficult to understand his lapse of memory. Let us consult Matthew, the toll collector (9:9) of the Sea of Genezareth, later an apostle and presumably an evangelist! Jesus went ab out 'all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues' (4:23), which housed the schools in tho se days. Synagogues came under priests and scribes. No one could just decide ex ca thedra to teach there: he had to be examined by the scribes and recognized as one of th em. Where did Jesus get the audacity to criticize this guild on which his teach ing activity depended: 'Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter the kingdom of heaven' (5:20). In his Gospel Matthew records speeches of Jesus whi ch raise justifiable doubts about his meekness. One recommendation from the mouth of the Son of God says: '... but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.' (5.22). If all Christians who cursed when they were angry were treated like? that, hell would be one gigantic crematorium."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" 62 In Chapter 5 Matthew quotes counsels that to the be st of my knowledge even the most devout Christians of any age have never followed an d, although they were divine commandments, could not follow: And if thy right ey e offend thee, pluck it out and cast it from thee (30) ... whosoever shall smite th ee on the right cheek, turn to him the other also (39). And if any man will sue thee at la w, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also (40). and whosoever shall compe l thee to go a mile, go with him twain ...' (41). I am always amazed when distorted quotations by the master are put in the appropriate passage of a 'story taken from everyday life' and then believed as 'God's word'. I have not met a single preacher who has tak en these words literally. Jesus repeatedly urges his hearers to speak clearly , they must never be 'lukewarm': 'But let your communication be, Yea, yea: Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil' (8:37). The Nazarene himself certainly does not follow his own advice for he speaks in veiled parables. For exampl e, when Jesus healed a leper by laying his hands on him, he said (8:4): 'See thou t ell no man', but adds in the same breath: '... go thy way, show thyself to the priest .' The original command to keep silence was pointless, because 'great multitudes' ( 8:1) were present at the miraculous cure. Yea-nay? Nea! Jesus asserted that he had not come to summon the r ighteous but the sinners to repentance: 'I will have mercy and not sacrifice.' But according to Matthew, mercy is in short supply, because Jesus threatens even for minor sins: '... the children of the kingdom shall be cast into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth' (8:12). Love one another - love thy neighbour as thyself .. . are the slogans under which the Christian churches have presented their doctrine to the people from the beginning down to today. Why and wherefore does not the Bible reader realize that Jesus simply became a Narcissus who did not follow these categor ical imperatives in his own example-setting person? Jesus says: 'He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughte r more than me is not worthy of me' (10:37). Can all that be reconciled with 'God's word' or is the Son of God in need of love? The citizens of Chorazin, Bethsaida and Capernaum p resumably had not received Jesus and his disciples with due friendliness. As a result the Son of God unceremoniously condemned them to hell until the la st judgment (11:20 et seq.). Matthew, presumably chronicling accurately the deed s of the Son of God, had to write contradictions en masse. Jesus sent out his messeng ers with the exhortation:' ... be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves' (10:16). That's what I call two- faced advice! Then he prophesies that they 'shall be hated by all men for, my name's sake' (10:22), but need not fear death. Why does Jesus notify his companions of such a frightful fate, when soon afterwards he claims with raised voice: ' ... my yoke is easy, and my burden"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" 63 light' (11:30)? Even in those days, close to the os tensible events, it was not easy to reduce 'God's word' to a common denominator. What is the point of a description by Matthew of a disgraceful injustice? 'And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said (22:1): The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a ma rriage for his son (2).' This 'parable' introduces a fine wedding with a fine poi nt. The wedding breakfast was ready, but the guests did not come. Again the king sent out messengers to invite the guests, but they spurned the invitation and even ki lled some of the messengers. Finally the king gave the order: 'Go ye therefore i nto the highways and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage' (9). People from t he street were driven into the hall. 'And when the king came in to see the guests, he sa w there was a man which had not a wedding garment...' (11). Wild with rage the king s aid: 'Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness: th ere shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth' (13). And the point of the parable that J esus formulated? 'For many are called, but few are chosen' (14). Commentaries and recipes for evaluating sermons can twist and turn this example of God's word to their heart' s content. To me as a simple Bible reader it remains an example of hideously asocial b ehaviour, I do not want any hints as to what is 'meant', I can read for myself. Yet another story related by Matthew does not seem to me to be inspired by the divine spirit. I summarize the text, Chapter 25:14-30. In this 'parable' a rich man goes on a journey and before his departure entrusts his money to his servants. On his return they report to him. One, to whom his master had entruste d five talents (= a silver coin worth 6,000 drachmas), had used the time to make te n out of them. Nothing but praise! Another had made four talents out of the two given him to look after. More praise! All of them had increased their capital except one. Thi s man, obviously an anti-capitalist, had buried the talent in his fear. He gave back the one talent he had received. Then his master said: 'Thou wicked and slothful servant, tho u knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strewed (26) . Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my comi ng, I should have received mine own with usury (27). Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents (28). For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be take n away even that which he hath (29). And cast ye the unprofitable servant into out er darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth (30).' This story cannot suit the Jesus People with their ideology, of the anti-capitalist Jesus, but it is the lesson read in church on the 27th Sunday after Trinity. Capitalists of all countries, praise the d ivine word! Multiply your talents! One last puzzle from Matthew (28:16-17). Eleven dis ciples (twelve minus Judas) climb the mountain near Galilee where Jesus had bid den them go. They saw him and worshipped him. 'But some doubted.' Since my Bible studies I can find no answer to the question what they could have doubted when face d with a human being who had been crucified and buried, but now stood before the m as large as life. Did they not believe their eyes. did they think he was a ghost? St. Mark tells some remarkable stories. He states p lainly that Jesus has brothers (3:31- 32) who appeared on the scene with his mother when Jesus was sitting at table with his disciples."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" 64 The presence of the wonder-worker had spread abroad and crowds were gaping curiously in the street. 'When his friends heard of it' (3:21), they went out to lay hold of him, saying: 'He is beside himself.' Did they th ink that Jesus was temporarily sub- normal? (Today psychology could give a plausible re asons for this.) The master did not want to have anything to do with his mother and brethren who were asking for him outside. Dismissing them, he put the rhetorical question: 'Who is my mother, or my brethren?' (33) only to answer it in general ter ms:'... whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is pay brother, and my sister, and my mother!' (34). We cannot find any feeling here of gratitude to the mother who had brought him into the world in ticklish circumstances. John baptized in the Jordan, where people flocked t o him. To all of them he preached: '... the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins' (1:4). We know - it occurs; later in Mark - that Jesus followed this appeal and was baptized. Surely we should ask: the Son of God have sins to forgive? *** Contradictions due to the distance in time and the antiquity of the texts are excusable. But when they succeed each other in the same breath , it takes theological gymnastics to explain them. According to Mark, Jesus says to h is disciples: 'Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God; but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables' (4:11), which is as mu ch as to say: You, my friends, understand my every word, but I have to explain thi ngs to the people in parables. Already in verse 13, he is angry with his disciples because they do not understand a parable: 'Know ye not this parable? and how then wi ll ye know all parables?' It is open to question whether the apostles ever un derstood exactly what Jesus meant. According to Matthew (13:11), Jesus said.'... it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.' He raises the disciples above the others who do not understand hi m, because 'blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear' (16). H ence we must assume that communication in the inner circle was so immediate that the code in which Jesus spoke every day was understood. Not a bit of it! Ev en the learned Peter had to ask: 'Declare unto us this parable' (15: 15). Jesus asks in astonishment: 'Are ye also yet without understanding?' (16). Did they understand ' God's word' or not? Presumably not, for even after the Resurrection, when they cou ld not ask the master for further explanations, John says that the disciples did not understand. Mark relates that John had told Jesus that the disc iples had seen a man casting put devils in the holy name and that they had forbidden him to do so (9:38). Jesus readily answered: 'Forbid him not: for there is no man whic h shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me' (39). This is pu t differently in Matthew. In his gospel, others have prophesied, driven out devils and acted in Jesus' name (7. 22). Then comes the typically demagogic answer: 'And then I w ill profess unto them. I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity' (2 3). Those may be the methods of the maquis - but it is not worthy of God to give pe ople tasks only to deny their existence later. ***"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" 65 It is not made easy for the Christian layman to fin d his way through the thicket of contradictions in the New Testament. It is simpler for informed theologians: they doubtless have a hot line over which they can get i nformation from the highest source. Through their mouths and again through the mouths o f those they teach, children in religion classes and believers in church learn how everything is to be understood and how it may on no account be interpreted. If only th e theologians were united on the subject! But, depending on their membership of a pa rticular church they get in each other's hair, violently, angrily, hotly in favour o f their own angle. And anything that cannot be brought under one head and is completely inexplicable is inflicted on 'those who are without' as a test of faith. How does it go ? 'Let your communication be yea, yea; nay, nay.' In the revelation of the holy word it is said that Jesus is the only begotten son of God, and that he admitted as much at a hearing before th e High Council. In fact the correct translation of Jesus' remark is not: 'I am', but 'T hou sayest so'. It is twist-ing reason not to understand what is meant, namely: I have nev er claimed it, you have attributed it to me! In Mark we also read: 'And Jesus said unt o him, why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God (10:18). J esus clearly points out the he is not God, but of course, he did not know what the decree s of the Councils would soon make out of him. Opposed to the dogmas that Father and Son are 'one' , and the trinity of Father, Son and Holy Ghost, is an honest confession by Jesus: ' But of that day and that hour knowest no man, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father' (Mark 13:32). If they had been 'one', each one of t hem would have been informed of the day and hour of a distant event. The High Priests condemned Jesus - for they found no other reason - because he had 'blasphemed' God. The High Priests asked whether he was Christ, the Son of God. The answer according to Matthew (26:64): 'Thou hast said.' The answer according to Mark (14,62): 'I am.' The answer according to Luke (22:70): 'Ye say that I am.' The contradictions of the evangelists are understan dable, none of them was present at the trial; they are merely reporting rumours. John gives rather more detailed information. Jesus defended himself before the High Council: 'I ever taught in the synagogue, and in th e temple, whither: Jews always, resort: and in secret have I said nothing (18:20). Presumably that was only half the truth, the defence of a rebel. Perhaps the Council also knew about some subversive activity of Jesus, as Matthew hints: 'What I tell y ou in darkness, that speak ye in light, and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon th e housetops' (10:27). Rebels have been convicted in all ages for subversive activity. Perhaps the reason for the accusation is to be sought here? The evangelists come to the unanimous conclusion th at Jesus was arrested without grounds. The High Priests and Council did their bes t to find charges: 'And the chief priest and all the council sought for witness again st Jesus to put him to death: and found none' (Mark 14:55)."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" 66 Until now it has not been explained what damaging i nformation Judas could really have betrayed. He does not report at any stage of t he trial, is not present at any hearing, nor does he appear as a witness for the pr osecution. It does come out that the elders paid him thirty pieces of silver. What for? For the identification of a man who was known all over the town. But had he, and there the affair becomes and remains inexplicable, given concrete grounds for accusation in addition to the kiss of betrayal, the authorities would not have been so helpless. Fu rthermore, Judas would certainly not have turned traitor for thirty pieces of silver . There must have been something else involved that we shall never know about. Judas coul d easily come by money, much more than thirty pieces of silver. Just as the Esse nes had their communal life organized with a central fund, Judas looked after t he money for Jesus' group. No, there must have been something more to it. Sentence and execution remain shrouded in mystery. Jesus was handed over to Pontius Pilate, who consid ered him innocent, but had him crucified in the end. According to St. John, the go vernor defended himself: 'Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him' ( 19:6). The Roman governor had been in the country long enough to know that Jews would not crucify anybody. Crucifixion was a Roman form of execution, so his offer was mea ningless. The Jews obstinately went on: 'We have a law, and b y our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God' (7). Why sh ould the Romans worry about that? Religious disputes did not interest them. Nev ertheless, John asserts: 'When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid' (8). What was he afraid of? He possessed the military and political power and w as in charge of the police force. He said as much to the silent Jesus: 'Knowest thou that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?' (10). So why on ea rth should he be afraid? Pilate ruled so despotically that he was recalled later. I f he had really considered Jesus innocent, he could have released him in spite of th e Jewish protests. Since a crucifixion subsequently took place, he must have h ad political grounds, and as we know political grounds are often left unmentioned. 'God's word' also shows considerable variations whe n it comes to Jesus' last words on the cross. According to Mark (15:34) and Matthew (27:46), he c ried in a loud voice: 'My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me?' According to Luke. 'he cried: 'Father, into thy han ds I commend my spirit.' According to John (19:30), his words were: 'It is f inished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.' The four gospel accounts also differ about the wome n's visits to the tomb of Jesus. Mark (16:1-8) says that Mary Magdalene. Mary the mo ther of James and Salome bought spices to anoint Jesus. On the way they were wondering how they would move the stone from the tomb, when they saw that it was already open and that a young man in a long white garment sat inside. He told them no t to be afraid, for Jesus whom they"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" 67 sought had risen from the dead. They were to tell t he disciples this. But the women fled in a panic, 'neither said they anything to any man; for they were afraid.' John (20:1-2) describes things differently. Accordi ng to him, only Mary Magdalene went to the grave early on the first day of the wee k and found the stone already removed. In a panic she ran to Simon Peter and the other apostles, telling them that they had taken Jesus away to an unknown place. Luke (24:1-6) only mentions 'women' (not mentioned by name), who went to the open tomb and found it empty. While they stood there sad ly, two men in 'shining garments' said to them: 'Why seek ye the living among the dea d? He is not here, but is risen.' Matthew makes the whole scene very dramatic (28:1-9 ). Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James went to the tomb, which was clo sed. Fortunately an earthquake began at that moment and the angel of the. Lord, hi s face like lightning and his robe as white as snow, came down from heaven, moved the stone, sat on it and spoke to the women. He showed them the place where Jesus lay and said that he had risen, and that they were to inform the disciples quickly. The fact that they also met Jesus on the way is no longer connected with the visit to the tomb. Should not the countless collaborators on the Bible at least have taken care to synchronize the central event of the resurrection i n the accounts? If, for some incomprehensible reason, the legendary 'original te xts' of 'God's word' did not contain a unified description they should have been edited for the good of the simple Bible reader who must now ask for all eternity: what real ly happened? The apostles' reaction to the phenomenal events is also most remarkable. They did not believe a word of the story told by the women, amon g whom were the two Mary's and Joanna. 'And their words seemed to them idle tales, and they believed them not' (Luke 24:11). John (20:9) even affirms: 'For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise from the dead.' This is quite incomprehensible . Throughout their four books the evangelists noted down Jesus' pronouncements that h e would die and rise again, yet at the end they knew nothing about it. Even without divine inspiration of the ultimate tru th the account of Jesus' ascent into heaven is also contradictory. According to Matthew (28:16-17), Jesus had summoned the disciples to a mountain near Galilee for the appearance. When they saw him, they worshiped him. 'But some doubted'. Still? Matthew has nothing further to say about an ascent into heaven. Mark (16:19) has only one sentence to cover the imp ortant event: 'So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.' It was as simple as that. Luke (24:50-51) makes Jesus himself lead the discip les 'out as far as Bethany'. While he was blessing them, 'he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.' John (21) has nothing to say about the ascension in to heaven."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" 68 The most important events in Jesus' life (as record ed by 'God's word' - a fact I have devoutly acknowledged in this textual comparison) w ere undoubtedly the resurrection and the ascent into heaven. The evangelists recorde d so many unimportant details that one cannot understand why they did not describe the two central events on which the Christian dogma is based in colourful gripping imag es and genuinely inspired language. If Jesus had ascended into heaven in full view of e verybody, or at least in the circle of his disciples, the news would have spread through t he streets of Jerusalem like a forest fire on the very same day, for the people ha d taken a lively interest in the trial and crucifixion. But not a single Roman or Jewish h istorian noted down a single word about these earth-shaking events! The evangelists s how only the most rudimentary knowledge of them and they were not eyewitnesses. I t is a crux interpretum. *** I am one of many hundreds of millions of 'Christian s', who are dictated to from the cradle and pay taxes for the privilege, but cannot believe in a dictatorial religion. I am not an atheist. I admire the magnificent drama whic h was written around the central figure of Jesus of Nazareth, I admire the products of Christian culture in painting, sculpture and music. I recognize most of the laws a nd rules governing human conduct in the codex of the Christian faith (as they are in essence peculiar to all religions, myths and legends). But I deny the claim of the church into which I was born to be the only one offering salvation, because I - to name only two examples - consider the dogmas and tenets of Buddha and Mohammed to be of no less value. Millions of devout Christians know nothing or too l ittle of the background of the Bible. Consequently, they accept it as the 'Word of God' from generation to generation: they take Jesus for the original preach er of his doctrine. But it has been proved that he adapted essential parts of it from t he Essenes by the Dead Sea. The fact that the Christian doctrines and customs are mostly borrowed from old religions is shown by documentation put at my disposal by Dr. Ro bert Kehl [27]. From it I take the following details, which are but a fraction of the material available. *** The Bible does not contain a single religious or mo ral idea which was not already contained in some form in the holy scriptures of ea rlier or contemporary religions. The immediate soil - not to say armoury and arsenal - for the present-day 'Christian', i.e. Pauline religious, communal and cult life was in particular the Hellenistic mystery cults (for their part largely taken over from the E gyptian and oriental cults). Practically everything that forms present-day Pauli ne Christianity is to be found in the cults of Attis. Dionysus, Mithras and Isis (a). (Th e letters (a) to (i) are referred to separately in the Bibliography.) The central figure of the individual mystery cults was always a saviour corresponding to the Pauline Christos, a 'Son of God', who was de scribed as 'the Lord'. The suffering and death of the 'Son of God' plays a decisive role in these cults, and there is also"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" 69 mention of crucified gods. A god's going down into hell ('... descended into hell') was a widespread idea, just as the ascent into heaven f ormed part of the salvation story in all mystery cults. The Trinity was known too, as it was in ancient Egypt. The sick were healed in the names of Mithras and Dionysus, t he dead woken, the sea calmed, water turned into wine etc. There was also the fest ival of Easter (celebration of the resurrection), in which the resurrection of the god concerned was conceived of in exactly the same way as in later Christianity (resu rrection on the third day, empty tomb, stone rolled away). The doctrine of salvation , which is considered as peculiar to the Christian religion, is found in all its details in the mystery religions. Even the basic Christian dogma of original sin was not really new (Mithras). Baptism with fasting and penitential exercises beforehand w as known in the Hellenistic mystery religions. The holy supper, also called 'Ta ble of the Lord', 'Meal of the blessed\" or 'Meal of the saints', had a great deal in common with the (later) Christian Last Supper. But it is of special significance that according to the mystery religions, too, this meal represented eating the body and drin king the blood of their god (communion). The bread for the supper was partly pr epared in the form of hosts with the sign of the cross. It is demonstrated that this 'Table of the Lord' was also conceived as a bloodless sacramental renewal of the divine sacrifice. Even the words spoken during the tran-substantiation in the presen t-day Catholic Mass are essentially prefigured: 'Say seven times; thou art wine; thou a rt not wine, but the blood of Athena. Thou art wine; thou are not wine, but the blood of Osiris, the bowels of Jao.' The faithful were reborn through this 'meal of the blessed' and, in contrast to the lost, who could expect a miserable fate, were described a s 'redeemed, saved, immortal'. The initiates of the mystery religions became 'chil dren of god' through the meal. God took them into his dwelling; they were united with him. The meal is also to be conceived of as actually sharing a meal with god. The life of the son of god or the founder of the re ligion shows striking similarities to the life of Jesus, not only in the mystery religion s, but also in the Eastern and Far Eastern pre-Christian religions. This begins alread y with the prophecies as 'Redeemer and saviour of mankind' (b). For example, the follo wers of the Zoroastrian religion were also told: 'The world is full of expectation o f him: he is the prophet Mazda.' Generally there is an account of the supernatural b egetting (c) of the saviour god, with the virgin birth being widely known long before Jes us, for example in the case of Buddha and Zoroaster. With Buddha the begetting is supposed to have taken place by the penetration of a divine ray into the womb of the virgin mother. Even more striking is the concordance in the descriptions of the birth of the religion's founder (d). Other founders of religion, besides Jesus, were born in a manger, put in a crib and wrapped in swaddling clothes: in other religions, too, the birthplace was lit by a bright light; in the case of other founders of religions, too, heavenly choirs singing praise appeared: even the adoration of the shepherds was not lacking. After the birth of both Jesus and Krishna (eighth t errestrial apparition of Vishnu, one of the main epiphanies of the divine in Hinduism), the slaying of all newly-born male children was ordered by a jealous king. The present ation of the child in the temple is also attested to. In particular all founders of rel igion were tempted by the devil (e),"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" 70 mostly in the desert where they were fasting. Here too details tally with the Bible, in that the devil first offers food and then worldly d ominion if his victim will submit. When Buddha was baptized, there was an earthquake a nd god proclaimed: 'Immortality is discovered.' (With Jesus ... this i s my beloved son...'). A striking similarity can also be observed in the deaths of di vine figures who are venerated as universal saviours. When Caesar died, there was tal k of a terrible darkness and also of the earth bursting open and the dead returning (f). The resurrection of sons of god who were transformed on this earth, are generally k nown in antiquity well before Jesus. The Risen Apollonius, a contemporary and a k ind of doppelganger of Jesus, appeared to his disciples. The mystery religions an d the Egyptian and Babylonian cultures before them knew both the concept 'I am th e vine' and the pastoral slogan 'I am the good shepherd' (g). The persecution of the a dherents of the mystery religions by the priests of the established religion was just as customary as the persecution of the Christians. The mocking of the suffering of Dio nysus is staggeringly like the mocking of Jesus. Most founders of religions and so ns of gods known to the classical and Far Eastern world before Jesus were miracle wor kers just like Jesus (h). The miracle of the turning of the water into wine has i ts parallel in the Dionysus legend. The sick are healed, old men become sprightly, the hungry are fed, the blind see, cripples walk, the dumb speak. Cures are performed at a distance, as by Jesus. Those who were healed carry their beds, the sea is calmed , 300,00 people are miraculously fed and there are many other instances. Peter sinking in the water (the man of little faith ) appears already in Buddhism. Buddha called himself 'the truth' like Jesus. Zoroa ster also proclaimed that he would 'return with the holy angels'. Lastly Krishna also preached that the world 'could not recognize him' (i). *** In conclusion, a number of texts from the holy scri ptures of other older religions are here compared with passages from the Bible, especia lly the Gospels: Abbreviations: \u0001 C = Christian \u0001 B = Buddhism \u0001 Hi = Hinduism \u0001 M = Mystery religions \u0001 T = Taoism \u0001 Z = Zoroastrianism Bible 1.

According to Puccetti, i f this claim were accepted, most of mankind would be excluded from salvation, because t hey had never had the opportunity to receive 'the joyous message' of Chri st's birth and his teaching. Puccetti[28] says that even if the gospel were gene rally diffused over our planet - which we all know is not true - only an insignifican t part of all intelligent beings in the universe would have heard of it, whereas the cl aim to universality also entails the duty and mission of making the doctrine of salvatio n known to all living beings, of allowing them to share in it. Professor E.L. Mascall [29] says that in the tradit ion of Christian theology the fact has already been emphasized, as the real meaning of sal vation, that the Son of God became one with the species he was going to save. T he Son of God became man in Mascall's analysis so that men could become God's c hildren through him. But we need not be alarmed by the prospect of innumerable incarnations and crucifixions in the universe. For, says the theologian, 'the very f act that the victorious redemption of mankind was finally achieved on our planet by Chris t's resurrection would justify a repetition in other places. In other words, if it i s possible in one case for the mortal and the eternal to unite in one person, why should not it also be possible in several cases?' In continuation of this idea Professor Puccetti com es to the conclusion that a single organic person definitely cannot be more than one o rganic person, however many incorporeal persons he may represent simultaneously ... 'Incorporeal persons can be everywhere at any time, but corporeal persons can o nly be in one place in the universe at the same time.' Puccetti, who, very courageously for a theologian, introduces the latest scientific findings into his religio-philoso phical interpretations, tries to explain the central question 'how could the Son of God beco me man in the universe several times -perhaps in 10 18 places - without simultaneously being more than one organic person? He comes to the conclusion that it is impos sible, but adds, if we take as a basis the above-mentioned figure of possible societ ies of extraterrestrial natural"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" 75 persons in the known galaxies (which make up approx imately one-tenth of all galaxies), and if we assume that the lifetime of Je sus of Nazareth represents the average duration of an incarnation of the Son of Go d, it would take 34 X 10 18 years before the Son of God had spent the time from birth to resurrection on each of the planets in Succession. The life expectation of stars whose planetary syste ms possibly offer the prerequisites for the development of intelligent life is only (1- 5) X 10 10 years in our galaxy. If we also accept this figure for the rest of the known i nter-galactic universe, between 680,000,000 and 3,400,000,000 incarnations would ha ve to take place simultaneously from today until the extinction of life on all thes e stars! If we deduct previous incarnations, the figure is reduced a little, but n ot enough to make any appreciable difference. If God is supposed not only to have assumed the app earance of a single member of a rational corporeal species, but also to have assume d its essence through his Son, whereby he would have transferred his personality t o this species, we would have to infer that there existed simultaneously in the univ erse many organic persons who were 'divine beings' in the Christian sense of the words . The following supposition makes it very clear what that would mean for Christianity. L et us assume that we could establish contact with a society fifty light years away from us and transmit the text of the New Testament to it. In answer we would receive a television picture of their Christ. He turns out to have nine fingers on each h and, four legs, a thick blue skin and long bones. We could then scarcely answer 'Yes, tha t is Christ' for that would be tantamount to saying, 'That is the Son of God as he appears to you!' which would be sheer Docetism. (*) On the other hand we could not deny his divine stat us (assuming he preached his 'Sermon on the Mount', died on the cross for their sins, etc.), for he would have the same right to it as Jesus of Nazareth. What could w e do? We had Jesus of Nazareth and they had their 'X Christ': both were beings ass umed by God, and both species would be included in Christ's 'being man' or 'being X' as separate incarnations of God's word. But if the Son of God happens but once, how can he be simultaneously wholly man and wholly X, i.e. exist as two differen t corporeal persons? Two corporeal persons are not one. A further point is t hat we should have quite as much reason for worshipping the ostensible 'X Christ' as our own Jesus Christ, and Christianity would no longer embrace a Trinity, but a fourfoldness, a 'Quadrinity' as it were. And the following are not my words (although they f orm my opinion, too!), the scholarly theologian Puccetti is saying them, the p rofessor who worries about the existence of Christianity in the future: What Christianity can do is to disregard the probab le existence of intelligent extraterrestrial beings completely.

Essays by Dr. Vyatcheslav Saitsev on 'A Spaceship i n the Himalayas' and 'Angels in Spaceships' in the Soviet periodical Sputnik spurre d me on to travel to Moscow in the summer of 1968. I cannot go along with Saitsev in h is latest speculations. Of course Saitsev appeals to the Gospels. What is t here one cannot prove by them? A little hard work is all that is needed to prove tex tually that Jesus was a warrior, general or king, politician or seeker of the truth, spirit healer, magician or soothsayer, sectarian preacher or - last but not least - the So n of God. It can also be 'proved' that Jesus was an 'astronaut'. What grounds did Saitsev find for his thesis? Matth ew (1:20), who makes 'the angel of the Lord' appear for Joseph? In other words the angel is an astronaut. Or the story of the 'immaculate conception'? In the astronaut version it 'naturally' became artificial insemination. What else? Or the heavens opening and the voice over Jordan at the baptism of Jesus by John (Matthew 3)? What else could that be but a spaceship from which a mega-phone bellows earthwards? or the two 'men in shining garments', who appear in Luke (24)? Astronauts! Or the angel in Matthew (28) with a face 'like ligh tning, and his raiment white as snow'? Another extraterrestrial being in a protecti ve suit! Or Jesus' saying: 'In my Father's house are many ma nsions'? That can only mean the innumerable inhabited planets in the universe. Or Mark's assertion (13) about 'the Son of man comi ng in the clouds with great power and glory'? It's obvious, the Supreme Commander is going to send his son in a spaceship."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" 77 Enough of that. The list could be continued with as many 'proofs' as you want. This is the position I adopt: 1) We must believe the texts of the Gospels if we a re going to infer alleged knowledge from them. For example, we must believe t hat Mary conceived Jesus immaculately, the Spirit of God descended like a do ve and alighted on the Lord, and a voice came out of heaven, a gleaming white angel ap peared at the tomb, Jesus actually did the deeds and spoke the words which were posthumously put into his mouth. Anyone who does not believe the texts literally, anyone who knows how 'God's word' origin ated, cannot accept the accounts as reality. Anyone who tries to deduce an 'astronau t Jesus' from the Gospels is committing the same error as judges who form and pr onounce a verdict of guilty on the basis of forged documents. (As far as the Sovie t citizen Saitsev is concerned, 'belief is a contradicto in adjecto!) 2) What is the astronaut Jesus supposed to have don e on earth? To have brought a religion, Christian or moral precepts? He introduce d nothing new. From a comparison of the gospels and the Qumran scrolls we know that the core of Jesus' teaching stems from the Essene community. His other contributions made no advance. It was not necessary to send out the cosmonaut Jesus in order to threaten men with punishment, to spread panic, to make hell the terminus for non- believers! 3) Interstellar space travellers would have operate d according to a precise programme, but the helpers from the spaceship came too late to save their top man from death. If the astronaut Jesus had been able to count on the h elp of his brothers in the cosmos at the right moment (which he must have known about), he would not have spent his whole life speaking of his unavoidable death. If we imagine that space-travellers would have left their important special messenger i n the lurch, we are really underestimating extraterrestrial beings. 4) Even if the resurrection were adduced as a proof , it would be absurd. Nevertheless, let us assume that the extraterrestrial visitors ha d succeeded in revivifying Jesus' corpse with their special advanced medical skills ( blood banks, transplants etc.). Would they have missed the chance of a public demon stration of their powers over death itself? Only a few people, and they doubted, knew about the miracle of the resurrection. Would not extraterrestrial visitors w ho had achieved such a feat have taken Jesus straight back to Jerusalem to show him and let him preach there? Their impressive achievement would have remained unknown without a demonstration of their superior abilities. Besides, according to the apostles, the medical reawakening had no consequence. The disciples remained behind i n confusion; they did not dare to appear in public. 5) Extraterrestrial intelligences who had mastered space-flight over interstellar distances would not have been so stupid as to visit only one point on the earth in order to introduce one local religious mission. So that t hey could be more effectively active, they would have made for various geographical locat ions, which would have meant a little extra effort, but would have been the only p ossible way to carry out the major operation of founding a religion. Spaceship landing s, observations of spaceships, UFOs or similar oddities have not been registered i n the history books during Jesus'"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" 78 lifetime, either in Jewish territory or other count ries. All the fantastic sightings by religious fanatics of Jesus after his death - Jesus in India, Jesus in Central America - are to be dismissed as fancies, for these 'founders of religions' once again refer to the frequently falsified gospel texts, which first turn ed Jesus into the 'Son of God' and the 'Redeemer'. He was neither. 6) If the astronaut Jesus, who was on a much higher intellectual plane than the people of Judaea, had wanted to refer to the future, he wo uld have had to conceal words and formulas in the parables that were to be handed dow n, formulas and codes which distant generations would understand. And should un derstand! 'Listen, ye sons and daughters,' he might have said, 'when the time is r ipe and your scholars know how to split the smallest particle of matter, the Son of G od will appear from the clouds.' Even scholars will not dispute that planning extraterres trial visitors would have endowed an astronaut Jesus with knowledge of the future develo pment of intelligence of our planet. If there were just one formula, only a shor t one like Einstein's E=mc 2 , in the gospels. I would be on Saitsev's side. 7) If extraterrestrial beings had really sent their man Jesus to Jerusalem to spread religious doctrines with the help of advanced techn ical aids they would have kept the development area under control. But obviously there was no control over Jesus' doctrine. Christianity grew out of Paul's embroider ies and soon took on a ghastly inhuman form. The Romans, as we can chillingly read in the histor y books, were not the only ones to persecute the Christians. Very soon it was the merc iful Christians themselves who slaughtered all non-Christians and deviators from t he one true faith. There is no saint's list of non-Christian martyrs, there would be far t oo many. No, we must forget all about the story of the astro naut Jesus; he did not exist, just as Jesus the Redeemer never existed. *** I should like to make clear four points about the f igure of Jesus as presented by the Church: a) Jesus was not the 'only begotten Son of God,' fo r Almighty God, the 'creator of heaven and earth', has neither sons nor daughters. b) Jesus cannot have fulfilled the function of a 'S aviour', because the concept of 'original sin', which can only be 'wiped out' by bl ood and martyrdom, is irreconcilable with the concept of an almighty and eternal God. c) The deeds, sermons and teachings of Jesus in so far as they have been handed down correctly, are not divinely inspired; they existed long before the time when Jesus is supposed to have lived. d) Jesus was - to mention the most recent explanati on - no astronaut. The idea is even more absurd than all the other things that have bee n claimed in the course of the last 2,000 years."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" 79 Jesus and the Christianity initiated by this presen ce on earth are not of divine origin, just as the Bible does not contain 'God's word' Wit hout this basis, visions cannot be attributed to God the Father, or God the Son or me Blessed Virgin Mary.

However, the fact remains that miracles happen and medically inexplic able cures take place at the sites of Christian visions. Does this mean that neverthel ess such phenomena are proof of 'heavenly powers' at work and evidence of the 'auth enticity' of visions of members of the Christian Hierarchy? After studying a mass of sophistical theological ex planations, one question takes precedence for me. If no genuine apparition has tak en place at what is supposedly the scene of a vision - i.e. of the Blessed Virgin, Jes us or the archangels - or if the personified vision is not identical with the figure s placed on record by the 'visionaries', how can 'miracles' and 'miraculous' cures happen in the name of those who are supposed to have appeared? I sought clarification on the spot. Lourdes, in the French Pyrenees, is the world's bes t known place of pilgrimage. As many as five million pilgrims travel their annually from the four corners of the world. The town is rather like a vast annual fair at which miracles are offered as attractions. The streets of Lourdes seethe with people even at n ight, although the night-life offers nothing more than a striptease of tense expectation s. The miracle business is flourishing; it has been bo oming for 125 years. In the countless shops there are crucifixes of every conce ivable kind and the statue of the Madonna is mass-produced in all sizes, for the offi ce and the front garden. Nor are the rosaries the same for all classes: there are expens ive models for the rich and cheaper ones for the less well-off. Which are likely to be more effective is beyond me. The objects on offer are fanciful and endless: pictures of the saints and clogs, purses, bells and plates, sunglasses, watches and lockets, candle s of all kinds: thick and thin, long and short, violet and pink, straight and artistical ly twisted and adorned with gold writing. On every single one of them - made in Lour des - the Madonna! Her face on the candles will flow away as wax tears; it is more permanent on the clogs and plates. I know a lot of bars all over the world, including the ones in Acapulco which claim to have every conceivable shape and size of bottle on their shelves. But in my opinion no establishment can compete with Lourdes when it come s to shapes. I have never seen such a collection of differently shaped bottles in my life. Pot-bellied and spherical bottles, rectangular and triangular, pocket-sized, litre and gallon bottles, of all colours and all sizes. In contrast to the bottles with deli ghtful contents at the Miracle Bar in Acapulco, none of the bottles contains anything but 'miracle water from Lourdes.' The shopkeepers know how deeply they are indebted t o the place's reputation, know precisely what ensures and raises their turnover."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" 81 They call their shops 'Au Paradis', 'Notre Chere Da me de Noel', 'Au St. Odile', 'Au St. Camille', 'Au St. Pape Paul X', 'Au la Paix du Mond e', 'Au Rosier de Marie' and, unbeatable in its simplicity, 'Au Sante Dame de la Grotte'. Since the girl who saw the Madonna was canonized, everything has been given a name with religious associations. Even the hotels are not given the nor mal names of earthly hostelries: one, for example, is even called Hotel du Vatican. Rome' s masters wear ample robes beneath which such things are easily hidden and not a cardinal in the Holy Office blushes. Disgusted by all this commercialism, I parked my ca r in the holy garage of a holy hotel for an unholy price. Secretly hoping that the inner illumination would come to me in spite of everything, I mingled with the crowd s in front of the basilica. Here at least, in the holy precinct, there were no stalls o r pavement salesmen. You were drugged, enveloped in the smell of candles and ince nse. Familiar, internationally known hymns, mingled with prayers, sounded from ste reophonic loudspeakers. The impression was confusing. What should one look at f irst? Sick people, in identical wheel-chairs, pushed or p ulled by helpers, went past in mile- long queues. The Lord's Prayer. In the big meadow a procession was forming with flags, cross and a statue of the Madonna at its hea d; a priest was saying prayers into a hand-megaphone. A vast production, staged several t imes a day. In rows of ten, the hopeful miracle-believers and c ure-seekers, myself among them, advance at a snail's pace, waiting patiently until they can fill their colourful plastic bottles with holy water from Lourdes at the taps wh ich are set into the wall. Many drink it, catching it in their hands so that they c an apply it to head or feet. Although it is all in the open air, there is a solemn atmospher e as if we are in the nave of a cathedral. All round hundreds and thousands of cand les are burning in a vast dance of lights. The only sounds are praying, whispering and hymn singing. Signs in several languages warn you that you are on holy ground and that anyone who forgets it will be immediately reprimanded by strict guards: they a lso see to it that those in a hurry do not jump the queue. Now I have reached the stream of water: I haven't g ot a bottle. I let it run into my hands, I watch my next-door neighbours. Their faces are marked with pain and rapture, with devotion and worship, with happiness and pride, simply from being here at last, so close to the miracle. Water is collecte d here in gallon and ten-litre bottles. For personal needs? Or do people finance the cost o f a second trip by selling small quantities once they get home? The phalanx of the hopeful advances step by step to the great goal, the grotto. It is eight metres long, six metres high and twelve metre s wide. At a height of about three metres, to the right of the entrance, stands the wh ite marble statue of the Blessed Virgin, on the very spot and supposedly in exactly the same attitude in which she showed herself to the little Bernadette Soubirous [ 1] in eighteen visions between 11th February and 16th July, 1858. The walls are damp an d glistening; the faithful kiss them, kneel on the ground and stare entranced at th e marble statue. They pray and many of them weep aloud. From time to time envelope s are thrown into a metal basket in the rear part of the grotto - petitions t o the Blessed Virgin. No stamps! In the middle of the grotto stands an altar with candles b urning in front of it, hundreds of"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" 82 candles which make the damp air stickily hot. The s ea of flames which I see shining at this moment has been shining incessantly since 1 8th February, 1858. If there is such a thing as an everlasting flame, it is here in the grotto at Lourdes. I was as deeply moved by the devout atmosphere at t he pilgrims' goal as I was disgusted by the eastern bazaar atmosphere in the t own. No one can be so hard-boiled as to be unmoved by what takes place at the water t aps, in the grotto, in the big square and the basilica itself. The countless cares and pa ins that are dragged here, the communal hope that joins the faithful together! The heavy burden of disappointment that many of them will carry on the journey home! I sat on a wall, 100 yards from the grotto. I crouched there for ten hours, until late at night. With the onset of darkness the stream of pilgrims decreased and the shimmer of the candles burning everywhere increased, became one great flame, dazzling one's e yes, heightening the already expectant atmosphere of Lourdes. The weeping of som e unknown fellow-man came steadily from the grotto, even long after midnight when I returned to my holy hotel. What magnet has the immense power to draw millions of pilgrims to this place year after year? The Madonna appeared to the fourteen-year-old sheph erdess Bernadette Soubirous (1844-1879) eighteen times in the grotto and gave h er orders and messages. Bernadette was canonized by Pope Pius XI on 8th Dec ember, 1933. By this act the Church recognized the authenticity of the visions a nd of certain miraculous cures which had been recorded at Lourdes. More effective 'publicity could not have been set in motion by headquarters at Rome. As far as the ar m of the Church reached, pilgrimages and processions (with tickets at reduce d rates) were organized in all dioceses. In 1858 more than 100 cures were recorded, seven of them being recognized as 'miracles' by the Holy Office. (By Catholic definit ion 'miracle' has always meant the 'breaking of the laws of nature'; as this concept i s scientifically dubious today, the Church now interprets a 'miracle' as something 'com pletely inexplicable'.) Since 1866 cures have been constantly publicized in the Journal de la Grotte. Out of thousands of ostensible cures the Church gave the, official title of 'miracle' to sixty- three cases. Dr. Aphoriso Olivieri, for many years President of the Bureau des Constatations Medicales, said in 1969 that even the n an average of thirty cures a year were recorded [2]. However, the Medical Bureau at L ourdes does not possess all the data of genuine or ostensible cures, because it onl y has details of patients who were admitted to the Asylum of Notre Dame or the Hospita l of Our Dear Lady of the Seven Sorrows. Between them 49,036 sick and ailing people were housed there in 1970, and 44,731 in 1971. How does an 'ecclesiastically recognized miracle' e volve? In May 1952 Mrs. Alice Couteault travelled from Poi tiers to Lourdes with an organized pilgrimage. She was thirty-four years old and had been suffering from multiple sclerosis (*) for three years. The journey in the pilgrims' train with many other very sick people was sheer torture for Mrs. C outeault. They prayed, lamented and sang hymns to Mary all the way. Relations and a ttendants looked after the"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" 83 sufferers. The atmosphere of pain and suffering was oppressive, nevertheless the hope they placed in Lourdes was alive and present and co nsoled them all. Mrs. Couteault felt better as soon as she arrived. In the early morning of 15th May Mrs. Couteault, wh o could neither walk nor speak, was taken to the bathing-pool in a wheelchair. When she was immersed she was on the point of fainting: all her limbs twitched. Afte r the bath she felt like a new woman. She was taken back to the Asylum of Notre Dame in t he wheelchair. In the afternoon she went for a short walk alone in the hall: no doc tor would have thought it possible. In the late afternoon she took part in the sacramen tal procession at which all pilgrims were blessed. Suddenly Mrs. Couteault felt as if sh e could speak again, but did not risk it, because she was afraid 'she might utter a hotch-potch of separate words and make herself ridiculous'. The attendants took her b ack. Outside the front door she got out of her wheelchair and walked into the Asylum un assisted. On 16th May Mrs. Couteault presented herself at the medical bureau. Under the direction of the President - it was Dr. Alphoriso Olivieri - various doctors f rom various countries diagnosed the patient's condition. (Any doctor who goes to Lourde s can take part in the examinations.) ---- [*] A chronic progressive disease in which patches of thickening appear throughout the central nervous system, resulting in various fo rms of paralysis. Cause unknown. ---- The certificates and diagnoses of doctors who had t reated Mrs. Couteault before the pilgrimage were read. There were opinions by Dr. Ch auvenet, a surgeon, Dr. Delams- Marsalat, a neurologist, and Professor Beauchant fr om her home town, Poitiers. Laboratory analyses were in the file. The unanimous diagnosis: multiple sclerosis, incurable. On this 16th May the doctors put on reco rd: 'Her gait and posture while walking are normal. There are no muscular contracti ons. The patella reflexes are normal ...' During the following years the patient was examined and re-examined at Lourdes: her cure was medically confirmed. On 10th May 1955, fif teen examining doctors certified that 'all subjective signs of the illness have disa ppeared'. Such cases of cures are communicated to an internat ional committee to which some 10,000 doctors, dentists, medical students and chem ists etc. belong. Another larger group received detailed reports on the history of t he disease and the cure at Lourdes. On 15th August, 1955 Professor Thiebaud of the Univ ersity of Strasbourg, declared: 'Examination of the patient showed no disturbances of functions. In particular she hears and sees well, and articulates correctly when speaking. ...' On 23rd June, 1956 the Commission appointed by Mons ignore Vion, Bishop of Poitiers, met at Poitiers. Following the doctors' o pinion, the Commission pronounced Mrs. Alice Couteault's cure to be 'outside and abov e the laws of nature'."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":" 84 On 16th July, 1956 Monsignore Vion ceremonially ann ounced: 'By virtue of the authority conferred on us in this respect by the Pridentine Council [= inspiration by the Holy Scriptures], with out decis ion being subject to the authority of the Pope, we hereby solemnly declare that the cure of Mrs. Alice Couteault, which took place at Lourdes on 16th May, 1952, is miracul ous and must be acknowledged as a special manifestation of the most blessed Virgin and Mother of God, Mary.' What are we to say about that? It is well known that the Medical Bureau carries ou t very strict and accurate examinations and that there are unbelievers and sce ptics among the doctors. No case of a cure is recorded unless the clinical picture b efore the event is given in medical certificates. The trouble with certificates is that they are rarely of recent date; they often go back years - to the origin and development of the disease. At best they are issued a few weeks before the deci sion to make a pilgrimage to Lourdes. But the question also arises whether docto rs can give an 'infallible' diagnosis, embracing all symptoms. For example, what diagnosti c value has the pronouncement that Mrs. Couteault appeared to be cured on 16th Ma y, 1952? The findings of the Lourdes Medical Bureau could be ascribed a higher d egree of scientific certainty only if the same doctors who certified the spontaneous h ealing process had themselves been observing the patient for a long time before, the miracle. But this strictly scientific method is not feasible with the thousand s of sick people who converge on Lourdes from all over the world. Since the theory of psychosomatic effects developed first by F.G. Alexander in America and later by V. von Weizsacker in Germany, was introduced into medicine, it has been proved in many clinical experiments tha t bodily processes and organic buffering can be directly influenced by psychic sti muli. Muscular performance, cardial activity and the separation of digestive se cretions, etc., can be altered by suggestion (hypnosis). Accurate observations have shown that organic disea ses often develop in critical life situations - indeed, it is beyond doubt that specif ic diseases or organs are subject to specific psychic situations. 'Psychosomatics concer n a subject who forms \"his\" disease himself and is not passively \"attacked\" by it; every disease has its characteristic expression in the living organism's outward manifestation of the psyche.' Diagnoses (Greek: deciding between) establish typic al symptoms of a condition; from them doctors infer therapies which are possible and likely to be successful. Diagnoses do not and cannot always show the cause of a diseas e or ailment, but only such ultimate absolute knowledge can effect a cure with certainty. If doctors could always recognize all the causes of illness, there would so on be no patients left. When the Medical Committee at Lourdes examines the findings before and after a cure, it is comparing two different conditions: wit h the best will in the world it cannot communicate the reasons for the change on the basis of this comparison."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" 85 Does the hope of a cure at Lourdes already pave the way for a miracle? Before a sufferer makes up his mind to make the lab orious journey, questions, doubts and hopes have been spinning through his brain for a long time. Has he not long since acquiesced in his fate? Has he not already visited every doctor who was recommended to him? Without success? Should he risk one last attempt to change his destiny on a pilgrimage? Could a miracle actually b ring him relief from his pains? If the decision to go on the pilgrimage ripens in this struggle between doubt and hope, does not the miraculous cure begin at this moment? Is not a change in his psychological attitude to the disease initiated? Dr. Alphoriso Olivieri [3] says of this possibility , 'that the hypothesis of autosuggestion or heterosuggestion (is) quite impro bable'. He points to Mrs. Couteault, who clearly recognized that she was suffering from an incurable disease, but adds that she had 'boundless confidence in the efficiency of the baths (at Lourdes) from the time of her departure and during her pilgrimage.' There is a big contradiction in these lines! Why an d where-fore can autosuggestion or heterosuggestion be categorically excluded as cause s of the cure, if it is simultaneously admitted that the patient had 'bound less confidence in the efficiency of the baths'? 'Boundless confidence' is an academical ly toned-down circumlocution for 'faith' and 'faith', according to the Church, is pe rsonal conviction, an assumption as opposed to knowledge. Hence 'faith' is a matter of influencing oneself, in other words autosuggestion. Then why explain away a crucial exp lanation of the cause of cures with a cleft tongue? *** The miraculous cure of Gabriel Gargam takes a speci al place in the annals of Lourdes, for Gargam was not a believer and went to Lourdes a gainst his better judgment. So was it a miracle? Dr. Franz L. Schleyer [5], who investigated 232 cur es with the collaboration of medical experts, came to the conclusion that in the case of Gabriel Gargam 'psychogenous mechanisms were obviously set in moti on on the basis of a severe trauma, and that these disorders were finally compl etely eliminated at Lourdes, after the organic consequences of the trauma had been lar gely cured beforehand'. Psychogenous troubles are physically controlled. Du ring his long stay in hospital and afterwards Gargam had inwardly resisted a cure: he was depressed and convinced that he would have to spend the rest of his life in a wh eelchair. He himself had given up the struggle. (This kind of 'flight into sickness' is a significant symptom of our time!) But Gargam's resistance to being cured was already broken when he agreed to be taken to Lourdes. Gradually the motor nervous syste m resumed its functions. The 'shock' of bathing in Lourdes water did the (positi ve) rest: the will to a healthy life was there again. A miracle? The end of an ailment, effected by a means that no doctor can give a prescription for."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":" 86 In the course of his investigations Dr. Schleyer st ated that 'women between the ages of sixteen and forty-five form the majority of sick people at Lourdes'. Out of 232 cases examined, 185 were female. Dr. Schleyer expla ins this as follows: Obviously the sick people at Lourdes consist predom inantly of a quite definite type of young woman, characterized by an abnormal facility for the release of involuntary reactions of the nervous system, with a long histor y of suffering, in the course of which these asthenic women (people of slight build) have had many serious diseases diagnosed -often with little justification. (It is sometimes astonishing how many different diseases a single female patient is suppo sed to have had before her pilgrimage to Lourdes.) At first the Church laid down that the cure of nerv ous-diseases could not be recognized in the category of miraculous cures. Med ical research has thwarted it. Since doctors know that neuroses can unleash organi c diseases, whose causes can be clearly explained by the patient's life and conflic t situations, that neuroses are motivated by the personality of the patient and are mostly inaccessible medically or surgically, miraculous cures are no longer miraculo us. With the progress of medicine genuine miraculous cures will become rarer and rare r. I am reminded of the wise saying of old Seneca that we learnt at school: 'Fel ix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas' - Happy the man who has been able to know t he causes of things! *** Water (especially springs that have appeared sudden ly) plays a legendary role at pilgrim shrines. The Hydrological Institute which m ade a physical and chemical examination of Lourdes' wonder-working water, issue d the following analysis on 8th October, 1964: Water with an almost neutral pH-value (measurement of the concentration of free hydrogenions) Free carbon dioxide content weak Gaseous carbon dioxide nil Water of average hardness (about 14') Slight mineralization, essentially from calcium car bonate Sulphate and chloride contents very low Soluble iron and organic materials content normal No effects from building materials or sewers In other words: absolutely normal drinking water th at cannot have any balneological effect! *** Lourdes is world famous for its miraculous cures, b ut it is not unique. Wherever a 'wonderworking Madonna' is set up at pilgrimage shr ines, miracles of all kinds immediately happen and cures are soon reported.

The orthodox Lourdes historians [6,7,8,9] object th at even that sort of miracle would not convince the sceptics. Jesus raised Lazarus fro m the dead, yet those who were not present did not believe in that unique miracle (Joh n 11:1 et seq.). The fact that scepticism even applied to Jesus himself is quite u nderstandable given the way in which 'God's word' originated. The apostle Thomas was among the sceptics who refus ed to admit that Jesus had risen from the dead: 'Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails and put my fingers into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand int o his side, I will not believe' (John 20:25, et seq.). Jesus appeared and challenged the unbelievers to pl unge their hands into his wounds. If we follow the gospels, the Son of God was determ ined to convince a sceptic. Why should not, in the case of a presumptuous claim to be able to work unverifiable miracles, just one Sceptical, scientifically traine d doctor, a man without faith, but plenty of knowledge, be convinced by an un-equivoca l obvious miracle? *** Miraculous cures have taken place at Fatima, about 100 miles north of Lisbon, since October 1917. Here are only two absurd examples fro m the records: As Miss Cecilia Augusta Goveia Trestes of Torres No vas had been suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, peritonitis and dropsy for years, her family, correctly assessing the situation, had already ordered a coff in for her. Although the doctors could do nothing, Miss Trestes was taken to Fatima on 13th July, 1923. Nothing happened at the miracle shrine. However, on the way home Miss Trestes, who normally had hardly any appetite, became as hun gry as a hunter. She greedily gulped down her attendants' provisions. After half an hour's pause for digestion, the taciturn Cecilia Augusta grew loquacious and even b egan to laugh and sing. A week later she was better [10]. Whether this surprising change was provoked by a ty pe of euphoria well-known in medicine, the sudden subjective sense of well-being of severely ill patients - and all the signs point to it - is not stated in the record s, nor when or where she finally got rid of her ailments. A thirty-year-old man from Camara de Lobos on the i sland of Madeira was a chronic alcoholic. Doctors prophesied that he would certain ly get cirrhosis of the liver with a fatal outcome. The young man went on carefully booz ing his bottle of spirits a day. Then his religious wife took a hand. She mixed a fe w drops of Fatima water with his daily ration of spirits. Wonder of wonders, from th at moment alcohol repelled the former drunkard. He lived to the age of seventy [11 ].

Do women pray more frequently? Or do Eve's daughters contrib ute more (imaginary) illnesses, confirmed by desperate doctors unable to find anyth ing concrete, to the Madonna? Let me make it clear that exceptional cures at the scene of visions are not denied. But let me also make it clear that as members of the Ho ly Family are not the cause of the visions, neither can they be the cause of the mirac ulous cures which indeed happen by virtue of visions. Nevertheless miracles are performed in the name of holy figures. The periodical Children of Fatima [l2] prints regular reports of c ures, confirms the addition of votive tablets or quotes from letters by people who certif y that they have received help from or been cured by praying to and invoking the Christ ian hierarchy. And the bulletins in this periodical do not only contain the names of Ma ry, Jesus, archangels and saints! Frequently letters of thanks are addressed to the d ead visionary children, who promptly grant requests of all kinds, although they have not been beatified or canonized by the Church, in other words, are active without religious approval. The Church not only decides which visions are 'genu ine', it also defines what a 'miracle' is. In 1870 the definition of what should count as a miracle was laid down by the Vatican. A miracle is 'in contradiction to the laws of nature'. Full stop. But this definition is over 100 years old, it has acquired a patina, like many church towers. Man is getting to know more and more about nature's tricks, he is even learning to manipulate the laws of nature at will. So I have a well-founded hope that in 100 years' time there will be nothing left we can call a mirac le. At the time of writing about 1,200 (!) cases for be atification or canonization are under consideration in the Vatican. There are already some 12,000 saints (!). Since Pope Benedict XIV published his work 'On the Beatification and Canonization of God's Servants' in 1738, the rule applies that e ach saint must be shown to have performed at least two miracles after his or her de ath. All those who are now on the waiting list of 1,200 'near-saints' have a very muc h harder time of it than their predecessors. Things that were readily accepted as miracles before are performed today by every competent medical practitioner. It i s no longer so easy to become a saint as it was before. I remember the Latin tag fr om my schooldays: Tempora Mutantur, nos et mutamur in illis (Times change and we change with them). What does the Church do when one of its servants pe rforms miracle after miracle during his lifetime? If he is venerated ... and pra yed to as a saint by the faithful without its supreme blessing? It tolerates the situ ation. In initiated circles it is considered quite certain that Francesco Forgione, who became world-famous under the name of Pater Pio, will be s ummoned into the community of"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" 89 the saints. Pater Pio performed so many miracles du ring his lifetime that he was turned into a (living) saint long before there was any question of canonization. Francesco Forgione was born in Pietrelcina on 25th May, 1887. He died as Pater Pio in the monastery of San Giovanni Rotondo on 23rd Se ptember, 1968, 'almost fifty years to the day when he received the stigmata of O ur Lord' [13]. Deliberately or by chance, little is known about Fr ancesco's youth. He said of himself that he had been a 'maccherone senza sale' (lazy la d). The Capuchins do not speak about the development of their saintly brother, but even during his novitiate rumours reached the outside world that 'strange phenomena' distinguished the young brother, for 'this pale emaciated novice dispenses with food for days on end. ... In Venefro he lived for twenty-one days solely on the Holy Euchar ist.' His weak health made him suffer from sudden attacks of fever which 'constant ly burst the monastery thermometers': the brother in charge of nursing tri ed him with a strong bath thermometer and the mercury rose to 48º (!). Nights in the monastery cell were exciting. 'Horrible monsters appeared from all side s, when he, obeying the holy rule, tried to get some rest.' Pater Pio was staying on his parents' farm to conva lesce. On 20th September, 1915, when his mother called him to lunch, he came out of a hut in the vineyard, 'waving his hands about as if they were burnt'. His mother aske d what had happened and Pio answered that all he could feel were slight prickin g pains. But according to the book which bears the highest ecclesiastical imprimatur, 'Pater Pio had really received invisible stigmata'. The invisible marks later bega n to bleed while he was sitting in the last row of the choir with his fellow brothers. Whe n Pio stepped forward, his hands bled, there were stigmata on his feet and a deep cu t in his right side. 'Pater Pio e un santo' cried the multitude. Pater P io is a saint. Photographs of the stigmata reached the Holy Office . (Today the Office of the Congregation of the Faith, formerly the Holy Inquis ition.) Pater Pio was ordered to undergo medical examination and so still the curios ity of the faithful. Doctors examined him and sealed bandages over the wounds. T hey finally stated that 'this kind of lesion was beyond the comprehension of scie nce'. Pater Pio lost a cup full of blood every day. Every day he wore brown gloves ove r the visible lesions. Apparently Pater Pio possessed all the faculties th at science now sums up under the heading of 'para-psychological phenomena.' He was v isionary and prophet, telekinetist and telepathist, wonder-worker and lon g-distance healer all in one. Pater Pio could not speak a word of English, but he under stood what American children said to him. He knew in advance what the penitent c hildren who were ripe for penance would confess or keep silent from him. He t old one man to his face that he harboured thoughts of killing his wife. In the case of a woman who was faced with a major gynaecological operation, the haemorrhages st opped spontaneously, and Pater Pio prophesied that she would give birth to a son. A year later she brought the boy to him in the monastery. Alberto de Fante, the official chronicler of San Gi ovanni Rotondo, relates that a man prayed for help at Pio's confessional box for his n ephew who was at death's door and"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" 90 had been given up by the doctors. Twenty-four hours later the nephew was well again; an 'undeniable' cure had taken place. A woman wanted to speed up the appointment given he r by the booking-office for three days hence - Pio was always booked up for wee ks ahead - but when she was pushing her way through the crowd and weeping bitte rly, Pater Pio stopped her and told her to go home quickly, for everything would b e all right. When the woman got home, her husband, for whom she had been going to i ntercede, was cured. The number of 'miraculous' reports is large. Once a man left the monastery in the evening after confession and was faced with a cloud burst. He waited, because he did not want to get soaked. Then Pater Pio approached h im and told him not to worry, for he would accompany him. When the stranger reached h is inn, people wondered why he had not got drenched through. The innkeeper unde rstood at once: 'Of course, if Pater Pio was with you ...' But Pater Pio was also able to do magic the opposite way round. One winter morning a female penitent arrived at the monastery in a downpour of rain. Pio touched her on the shoulder and to her astonishment the signora's clothes 'were bone dry in a moment'. Bilocation * was obviously also within Pater Pio's powers. The authoress of the approved account says that the father could 'pass t hrough closed doors' to the great astonishment of the crowd who were waiting for him. In the process he was able 'to mislead insistent inquirers and put off the curious . \"Where were you, father? We were looking for you everywhere!\" Pater Pio chuckled: \"I was walking to and fro in front of you, but you didn't take any notice.\"' The suffering father ('I suffer when I do not suffe r' - Pio on Pio), even conjured up sweet smells in frowsty rooms. Dr. Romanelli though t it unseemly of Pater Pio to use scent, as he imagined he did. A Capuchin explained to him that Pio's blood was impregnated with the 'sweet scent'. When a Dr. Fest a took a piece of linen soaked in Pater Pio's blood to Rome to have it examined in a laboratory, his fellow travellers asked him what it was that smelt so nice. In July 1 930 a living-room in Bologna suddenly smelt of roses and narcissi. A sick girl h ad just returned from San Giovanni Rotondo. ---- [*] Being bodily present at two different places si multaneously. ---- The heavenly aroma lasted for a quarter of an hour and then the sick girl was able to move her paralysed arm again. There can be no doubt about the phenomena of smell, because the number of witnesses has been very large over four decades. In the words of Michael Faraday (1791-1867), there is obviously 'nothing too miraculous to be true'. Pope Benedict XV anticipated all requests for canon ization by saying: 'Pater Pio is truly a man of God.'"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":" 91 Pater Pio bore the stigmata of Christ before the ey es of contemporaries. His famous predecessor, Francis of Assisi (1182-1226), was the first person to be afflicted with officially attested stigmata. And he was canonized two years after his death. His stigmata are legendary; the saint who talked to the birds has long been singing in the choir of angels. Since St. Francis was marked by th e stigmata, about 350 people are supposed to have been similarly afflicted. Not all stigmatics bear genuine signs. For example, Therese Neumann (1898-1962) from Konnersre uth in Oberpfalz, Germany, who hit the headlines.is reputed to have been a fak e. The theologian Dr. Joseph Hanauer [14] suspects that Therese scratched the wo unds on her own body, because she often sent visitors out of her room and then sh owed them the bleeding wounds when they returned. Unofficially it is said that Th erese received the stigmata during Lent 1926, and had visions of the Passion of Our Lo rd on every Friday except for Christian holidays. Reports however of devout people who have borne the marks of the crucifixion on hands, feet and below the heart are announced too o ften and by too many witnesses to be dismissed as nonsense. The 'marks of the Lord Jesus' (Galatians 6:17) are reputed to hurt like the wounds of the crowning with thorns and nailing to the cross; they bleed on Fridays for reference and are incurable by normal treatment. Are we faced with confirmation of an unassailable m iracle? I must admit in advance that no proven explanation of the stigmatic phenome na exists as yet, that is why they are still surrounded by a thick, well-protected occ ult veil. *** The reader should know that in the past cult and re ligious happenings provably arose around people ostensibly possessed by demons. Epile psy (sudden insensibility accompanied by convulsive seizures) was called morb us sanctor, the 'holy disease', because those affected by it often had visions of L ucifer, spirits, gods and angels. 'It is well known that Mohammed, too, suffered from epilep tic attacks and was considered divine by his people for this reason. He himself re counts his stay in Paradise in the Koran.'[15] Professor O. Prokop says that experienc es in epileptic states are mostly of a religious nature and that people subject to them tend to asceticism. (A characteristic of stigmatics!) They are able to induce the demonic attacks by breathing techniques - 'by shifting the balance of the acid bases'. Catalonia, a form of schizophrenia characterized by restlessness and excitement with periodic states of stupor, develops special powers in religiously fixated persons. 'The fascination is all the more effective ... as the sc hizophrenic works on his environment without loss of intelligence.' Professor Prokop and others also mention hysteria a s a genuine ailment of a psychic nature. They attribute to hysterics 'a marked desir e to be honoured, loved, praised and recognized, and also their joy in the ability to at tract people to them by their own charms ... and in this way explain why the religiou s martyrs not only bore their martyrdom but also went to meet it gladly'. In addi tion there is the frequently proved fact that hysterics are virtually insensible to pai n."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" 92 In my opinion the brief description of the clinical pictures gives essential hints about the predisposed state of people who are sought out by stigmata. All three symptoms of illness point to damage or disturbance of the nervo us system. Simple reference books describe a 'stigmatic' as a man with a hypersensiti ve nervous system who tends to react to psychic and other stimuli with disorders ( stigmata.) The parasympatheticus, a part of the vegetative nervous system, acting on st imuli or orders from the brain, makes the eyelids close, tears flow and spittle run , but it also controls the sexual organs, etc. In a state of heightened tension (vagotonia) the or gans looked after by the para- sympathetic nervous system require very small stimu li; organic disorders can arise. Abnormal states of tension (dystonia) of muscles an d vessels are typical of weakened vegetative nervous systems; they are expressed by o rganic troubles ... and in the skin by excess or congestion of the blood (hyperaemia). To round off the brief medical discussion, I should mention hyperaesthesia with it s morbidly increased sensitivity to touch as a result of the most varied diseases of th e nervous system. To sum up. In all the cases of stigmatics known to me spontaneous excitability was as marked as the development of special powers. There can be no doubt that without exception they exercised a - deliberate or involunt ary - fascination on their fellow humans. Did they not also feel a humble joy in 'bei ng honoured, loved, praised and recognized'? Could they deny their ability to draw men to them by their own 'attractions' (= stigmata)? How could they bear pai n except as a result of a specific medical condition? Were not their bodily functions also subject to the orders and stimuli of the nervous system? The sum total of these clinical pictures, in my opi nion, put stigmatics in a stress situation which influences their whole bodies. Prof essor Dr. Hans Selye, Director of the Institute for Experimental Medicine and Surgery in the University of Montreal, the 'father of stress research' describes such stat es: 'Stress is always expressed by a syndrome, i.e. a sum total of alteration, not by a single alteration. An isolated effect on a single part of the body either causes damage o r stimulates higher achievement.' [16] In the present-day state of knowledge it need only be mentioned in passing that every conceivable ramification is bound to the end effect by autosuggestion. *** On 14th October, 1973, I talked to Professor Josef Brudny, rehabilitation expert at New York University, in the Plaza Hotel in New York . 'You cured a young man who had been tied to a wheel chair for years with a broken spine, without an operation. Are you a miracle doct or?' 'There was no question of a miracle.

'What is this machine exactly?' 'It's an electronic apparatus which can be compared to an encephalograph. It registers certain biological processes, e.g. heart beats or b lood-pressure, but also gives the patient signals as soon as a change in the current is registered. For example, if the heart beats more slowly than it should, the patient hears a rhythmic peep-peep through his headphones showing what his heartbeat should ac tually be. The brain reacts at once and orders the heart to beat in the rhythm rec ommended.' 'In other words the brain tells the heart how quick ly it must beat?'"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":" 100 The human organism is like a cybernetic system with its control and regulatory mechanisms, a permanently self-contained cycle of f unctions. The brain orders the muscles to react in such and such a way. It itself obtains its information from sensors of all kinds, through taste, touch, sight, smell, h earing, feeling of pain etc. For example, if the heart starts to beat irregularly, t he brain immediately records a panic situation. There are intensive orders to the heart muscle and it obeys, providing there are no special circumstances to prevent it, such as a blockage of an artery. 'My colleague, Dr. B. Engle of the San Francisco Me dical Centre in the University of California, has succeeded in deliberately, i.e. sug gestively, slowing down or speeding up the heart beats of several patients. The \"guinea -pig\" sits in front of red, green and yellow signals. \"Yellow\" corresponds to the patient 's normal heart rhythm. If the doctor orders a quicker heart beat, the red lamp li ghts up and a simulated quicker heart beat plays through the patient's headphones. The patients experimented on are affected audio visually. They try to follow the ord er of the red lights and the beats in their headphones. In a few seconds the recorded hea rt curve shows a diagram with a quicker heart rhythm than the person should normall y have. In this way it is possible to slow down the pulse, alter blood-pressure, order heat or cold on the surface of the skin ... or even, as in the case of the young paral ytic, successively overcome the paralysis. These are proven medical experiments, no t miracles. This method is known as \"Bio-Feedback\".' Of course we cannot attach the slightest blame to s tigmatics for having no idea of the reasons and origins of the signs, or for their know ing nothing about Bio Feedback, a method which permits direct conclusions. In the case of persons living in a state of religio us ecstasy we do not know how gradual pathological changes in their body cells an d tissues are caused by their psychic fixation on the revered figures they are so keen to resemble. It is quite possible medically that heterosuggestion which is a ctive for years and becomes so natural that it is an unconscious part of existence can finally produce stigmata. Women predominate when it comes to stigmata, as the y did in the case of miraculous cures. Possible motivations have already been menti oned. If religious fanatics, whether men or women, desire the mark of the Lord w ith a devouring ardour - stimulated by visual signs which constantly provide them with images of our wounded Lord on the cross stimulated by acoustic si gnals, which represent the crucified one in prayer and song - at some time the 'beast brain' will obey and give orders to supply the arteries and veins so richly w ith blood that they swell up and finally allow small drops to appear on the epidermi s. Above all the will to suffer and the inner wish to feel the pains of the Redeemer do minates. The prominent English surgeon Richard Sergeant [17] asks 'Is it really necessary to suffer to achieve salvation? ... Does salvation jus tify pain? In the lay hierarchy of the Christian heaven the host of the martyrs takes thir d place after the apostles and the prophets. In other words martyrdom is the only way for the ordinary man to enter the kingdom.'"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":" 101 The will to join the community of the blessed throu gh suffering, pain and asceticism, in brief through martyrdom, is clearly the essence of stigmatics. Those who bear the stigmata have iron wills. Let us leave the religious enclave to demonstrate b y a profane example what an iron will can achieve. ... During the twenties August Di eber, a miner, was buried alive when a gallery collapsed owing to bad weather. He w aited two days and two nights to be rescued. His right thigh and part of his foot we re jammed by blocks of stone. The miner first willed himself not to feel the pain, bu t he sensed that his limbs had grown cold and lost sensation. Then he concentrated the w hole of his will on sending blood to the 'numb' thigh. At first he felt severe pains which he rejected, then he noticed the return of heat and sensation. When he was medically examined, both thigh and foot were found to be well supplied with blood, to the g eneral astonishment of the doctors. Amputation was unnecessary. The miner had discovered a new faculty during the a ccident. By will power and suggestion he could make parts of his body insensit ive to pain (fakirs!), and even send blood to parts of the body chosen by him. He traine d these faculties and became an international variety attraction. It was no novelty for artists to have their bodies pierced with needles and swords on the stage. But by dint of intense concentration thi s man produced the classical stigmata on his skin while the public watched in br eathless excitement. He did this at every performance, and twice on Wednesdays and Sund ays. The variety 'miracle' ended in a nervous breakdown. Smart managers wanted to make the performance hyper-perfect. The artist was to we ep tears of blood, too. As he could not force any blood through the cornea, even with t he greatest effort of will, the mercenary manager had an obscure opthalmalogist com e to his dressing-room before every performance and make tiny perforations in the eyeballs. August Dieber did weep tears of blood on a few occasions, but then hi s nerve gave way. The tears have nothing to do with my subject but the story shows t hat a man possessed of an iron will can force stigmata to appear on his body. Professor H.J. Campbell, a physiologist at London U niversity, has convincingly demonstrated that the brain in men and animals is d evoted to procuring pleasure. The embryo begins its intrauterine growth with a head t hat is comparatively out of proportion. In it the grey matter of the brain make s the body grow according to programmed patterns. The nerve paths which strive t o procure pleasure are already formed at birth. From the baby's first cries the pr ocess of experience with its reactions to feeling pleasure or pain begins. The environment - parents, uncles, aunts, teachers and parsons - continually and rather thoughtlessly nourishes the 'beast brain' co mputer with rules for human behaviour and moral laws. In addition discoveries w hich the sensory organs report to it must be stored in the tiniest cells of the brain . Fixed reactions for future behaviour are programmed from all 'reports' to the brain. You may not do that, you must do that, you may say this but not that, you must and shall b elieve this, it is forbidden to believe that etc. Or experiences such as these: tha t is hot, you are getting burnt, this is"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":" 102 cold, you are freezing, sing for it cheers you up, smell a rose for its scent is pleasant, etc. As the striving to procure pleasure still dominates , even after education, learning and religious teaching, Campbell says that a single ord er was given to the brain computer of our first ancestors: 'Activate pleasure procurem ent!' Campbell uses the concept 'pleasure' in a strictly scientific sense. By it he means the feeling arising from increased stimulation of the pleasure areas which o ccur in the higher brain layers. In such a sense, thought 'can lead to the setting up a nd transformation of preferred paths in the brain and thus give the individual the power to shape his mind with forethought'. What the individual registers and selects as procur ement of pleasure for him-self, he himself determines according to inclination and tas te. The work of Campbell, who worked as guest professor at the Max Planck Institu te of Brain Research at Frankfurt, and the College de France, Paris, provides importan t hints for our theme. From his first vague thoughts the Christian's presu mptuous 'faith' forces him to believe that he is the Lord of Creation, 'chosen' b efore men of other faiths because the Redeemer died for him; that special mercies are res erved for him, because the heaven of the blessed is assured him in return for behavio ur pleasing to God (and the Church); and on top of all this, that there is an infallible judicial tribunal over good and bad, namely the Pope, governing his earthly (Catholic) e xistence. This doctrinaire 'upbringing' goes hand in glove wi th the suggestive visual infiltration of religious doctrine, e.g. by illustrations of the text of the rosary learnt by children, by Christ's stations of the cross, by gifts of sent imental coloured prints of Mary on the occasion of one's first Communion (children of eigh t or nine take part in the Eucharist for the first time). Church interiors present the w hole pomp of a kingdom of heaven 'on earth' with images of Christ on the cross artis tically carved in wood or sculptured in marble, the stigmata generally dripping with blo od in a most realistic way. They display statues and pictures of Mary, with and with out the infant Jesus, Mary kneeling at the cross in Gethsemane or sheltering the head o f the sufferer in her lap. They offer statues and paintings of the saints. Martyrs and pa tron saints lie in state under countless glass cases. And everywhere we see the br illiant graphic emblems of the cross. Visual signals of the 'only true faith' foll ow the faithful everywhere, for it is a pleasure to partake of the holy life. The vast size of the churches, in which man appears so minute, and the reverent atmosphere in small intimate chapels induce complet e repose, relaxation, meditation. Prayers lull those kneeling in the pews. During the mass or high mass fascinating stage management forcibly attracts the attention of the congregation to the mystery of the transubstantiation, the changing of the wine in to the blood of our Lord. The liturgy is the form of divine service, the 'religious reali zation of Christ's work of redemption through the Church'. Acoustic signals, with the ant iphonal singing of priests and congregation, magnified and intensified by the peal of the organ (whose almost exclusive adoption is one of the church's cleverest 'effects'), sensitize the congregation, which is already receptive to the great spectacle. The texts of the hymns literally teem with painful suffering: indeed, they immerse the fa ithful in a feeling of perceiving pain as a pleasure to be sought for, so that thereb y they can come closer to the Redeemer. Naturally they end, mostly in a chorus, w ith a promise of heavenly happiness! It is a pleasure to suffer and participa te in pain."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":" 103 The visual and acoustic signals, as introduced by m odern medicine in Bio Feedback, and the wish to procure pleasure programmed in the human brain demonstrated by Campbell provide illuminating explanations, in my v iew, of the detailed accounts which visionary children (and the few adult visiona ries, too) put on official record. They are 'visions' of pictures and images that have followed them around since they were tiny. Their messages contain texts and vocable s which are really childish simplifications of the theological double-dutch pum ped into them from pulpit and schoolmaster's desk ... because they have frequentl y misunderstood what they heard and learnt, they bowdlerize sermons and catechist t exts. The result is mysterious incomprehensible communication in which supernatura l ideas, soothsayings and prophecies are hopelessly confused. It is not surprising to anyone familiar with the in fantile psyche that it is mostly the youngest of all who are able to enjoy visions. They live in fear of purgatory, 'the place of purification', 'the fire ... for punishing those who have not done penance for their sins' (1 Corinthians 3:15, German version.) Childre n fear the threatened punishment, so they do everything in their power to avoid the t orments of hell. With naive passion and unbridled childish imagination they become infl ated and involved in fantastic ideas and undertakings. There is nothing they long for more than to meet the wondrous figures of the religious world face to fac e. Every day they learn from beautiful legends about favoured people who have me t members of the Holy Family. Parsons and Sunday school teachers have told them t hese legends, and the Church does not lie. (Stories with ghastly contents, as ev ery psychologist knows, can cause anxiety neuroses in children.) Out of the fantasy g rows the enjoyment of forcing miraculous experiences to occur. Then the children 'suddenly' experience, but with full sensory perception, true dreams, which have a surprising content of truth (namely the figures, symbols and words of their religion) ' which appear to lie outside the normal apparition. The objects of the true dreams h ave long before been recorded by the dreaming psyche. Now, in a flash, they become t he \"revelation of the reality of the conscious\".' (Herder.) The striving for pleasure, i n the case of the children their joy in the vision, is fulfilled. It is unfair to dispute the subjective 'truth' of t heir visions. If the Church does not want visions to exist on a large scale, it must change o r exclude the training in readiness to receive experiences, the wish to be confronted with the Holy Family. That is something it will certainly not do, as it can make very good use of the so-called 'genuine' visions in its proselytizing work. Walter Nigg, the hagiographer already mentioned, who wanted to see the return of the sain ts, expresses a pious hope that is equally applicable to the 'necessity' of visions: ' Admittedly they are virtually forgotten nowadays; they are spoken of infrequently or not at all. Yet the silence will not endure, for suddenly they will speak to men again.' The Chu rch, too, has its specific wish for pleasure, for pleasure in miracles. *** In order to increase the procurement of pleasure in the faith, some tricks have been integrated into the Mass. The American Leslie M. Le Cron[19] says that a burning candle is best suited for the stimulation of hetero suggestion (and what else is devotion?). It should be set up in such a way that it is pleasant to watch. 'The nickering flame of a candle has a hypnotic effect.' Campbell proved by experiments"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":" 104 that white, with its many frequencies, provoked int ense feeling, of pleasure. 'Brightness contrasts with the boring monotony of t he surroundings and hence produces pleasure.' Naturally the smart ecclesiastical bigwigs had no a cademic justification when they installed the Lucerna, or eternal lamp, before the altar as a 'sign of the presence of Christ as light of the world' (John 8, 12). But dur ing its 2,000 years of history the Church has shown an infallible instinct, a sixth an d seventh sense for 'effect'. For a long time now, the eternal lamp has not been confin ed to the interior of the Church. Candle stands offer the effective illumination for sale right at the entrance. There is not a single church without countless candles burni ng away before altar and high altar, before pictures of the Madonna and saints. They exc ite the desired raptures. At places of pilgrimage candle orgies create Orphic mysteries which stimulate a state of preparedness for miracles with their sea of ligh t. Torch- and candle-bearing processions are common on high holidays. In the lig ht of present-day psychological knowledge, they effectively stimulate that state of 'being outside one's self in which even miracles still have a chance of being believed . *** I have no intention of entering the boundless terri tory of psychology, but I should like to illuminate one sector which can answer some ques tions - I refer to the psychotherapeutic method of psychodrama. A group of patients act out their conflicts to liberate themselves from their frustrations and neuroses. The therapy effects a healing process. Actually this highly modern concept can be found as early as the Greek philosopher Aristotle (384 B.C.-322 B.C.). Aristotle realized t hat ideas do not work outside, but in, the body as an effective force. His idea of entelec hy (= forming power) which he took over from physics was introduced into his moral phi losophy which survived for centuries. According to it, the mind is matterless energy (= the first forming power). Tragedy, say Aristotle, achieves through catharsis (= purification), the decision between good and bad, a miraculous healing effect? (Psychodrama!). Dr. Ploeger, a university lecturer [20] explains th e process as follows: 'An implicit condition for it among the spectators is their iden tification with the hero, whose actions they accept and find in agreement with thei r own ideals and motives.' (Such identifications exist at all places of pilgrimage — with members of the Holy Family!) Dramatic representation of the conflicts effecting a cure in the Aristotelean sense produces effects much like those obtained by psycho drama as practised in western and eastern countries today. In Chinese philosophy of the fourth and third centu ries B.C. there existed the concept of the Tao, which means something like path or way. Tao was the world's primal cause, which was at the root of all phenomena, but was beyond rational perception. In this philosophy the Yin and Yang (dark and light) s tand for positive and negative values. As Professor Ilza Veith [21] says in his es say 'Psychiatric Thought in Chinese Medicine', the Chinese have never, like other cultu res, imagined their creator as a figure who demanded obedience and devotion. Undistu rbed by a punitive vengeful"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":" 105 god at the beginning of things, the Chinese sought edification and healing in the additive power of likeminded 'souls', in the groupi ng of family and friends. Here, too, the mind of a community which was fixated on an ide a did its work and the cure was accepted as a miracle. Those are examples of the stages of the development on the way to psychodrama with its 'mechanisms of inter-human reference.' [22] Autogene training, which is relevant in this connec tion, also has a solid tradition. The Gottingen neurologist Johannes Heinrich Schultz (18 84-1970) introduced this kind of self-hypnosis, which leads to relaxation through a certain inner attitude, into general use. It has an approximate counterpart in the incub ation or temple sleep of antiquity. Incubation effected divine revelations and the cure of diseases in dreams, (incubare: to lie down in a consecrated place). In classical times incubation leading to relaxation was preceded by bathing. (Lourdes and elsewhere!) 'The actual incubation was carried out peacefully in the abaton, the holy of holies of the temple.\" (What other effect d o churches and altars have?) Dr. Von Schumann[23] says that muscle relaxation and fa lling asleep during incubation (as in autogene training) must be in close correlat ion, for then the suggestible and credulous patients, uncritically wide open for a re ligio-magical cure, can be healed and liberated of their disorders. The person seekin g a cure behaves passively during incubation and 'awaits ... a magical cure from the God Asclepios'. If for example we substitute the name 'Bernadette Soubirous' for the god Asclepios, we think we are reading an account of what goes on at Lourdes. The god Asclepios (Aesculapius) was active in the s anctuary dedicated to him at Epidaurus, a city on the Saronic gulf famous in ant iquity. But he also 'worked' in the temples of Cnidos, Cos, Pergamon, Sikyon, Naupaktos and Athens. He ran many branch sanctuaries in which cures were effected for every kind of thing that cropped up. They were visited by blind, crippled and dumb p eople, by dropsical patients, by those with organic diseases, patients who had tape- worms and those plagued with falling hair. The busy god had to keep on performin g miracles - just like the statues of saints at modern pilgrimage shrines. Rabbi Ben Akib a used to say: It has all been done before. ... The temple of Epidaurus with its inscription 'Enter as a good man, depart as a better one', was a place of pilgrimage by cure-seekers fro m 500 B.C. onwards, the Lourdes of the 'Golden Age' of Greek civilization. In addit ion to the head 'doctor' - Asclepios - 'friendly gods of healing' also worked miracles dur ing the healing sleep. Kurt Pollack [24] writes: 'The miraculous cures mai nly took place in the case of the blind, deaf, crippled, sleepless and other sufferer s, who would be classified today in the great army of neurotics and vegetatively stigma tized. The divine doctor cured many people whom earthly practitioners had not been able to help.... The able members of the Asclepian priesthood became experien ced observers of human nature who knew exactly how to exercise psychic influence on the sick. In a certain sense, whether they knew it or not, they were predecessors of present-day psychotherapists.' Need one comment on this kind of miracle? The Churc h knows its history."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":" 106 The psychotherapeutic effect of music too was well known to the Pythagoreans of the sixth century B.C. (I can hear the laments at Lourd es!) The Syrian philosopher lamblichus tells us: The Pythagoreans used music as a cure; and there we re special melodies against psychic suffering, namely those against depression and anxiety, which were considered the most helpful - others against violen t emotions and passions and against every kind of psychic confusion. In certain kinds o f tones and rhythms, by which the disposition and mood of men is improved and their p sychic state restored to its original state, Pythagoras found the means for paci fying and healing illnesses of body and soul. How similar the two pictures are! The miracles that saints and their adjurants perfor m today were performed by Asclepios and his disciples at Epidaurus with ident ical or similar methods, and without any Christian help! Fortunately because it is demonstrable, those cured in classical temples also felt themselves obliged to express their thanks in a sim ilar way to those cured at the shrines of visions and miracles. They, too, put up votive tablets. In A.D. 165 the Greek writer Pausanias from Magnesia in Asia Minor stood before the ruins of Epidaurus. In the second volume of his descriptions of Greece (Periegeses tes Hellados), he observed: In olden times there were even more inscribed plaqu es within the enclosure of the sanctuary than there are today. Now there are only six left. On them are recorded the names of men and women who were cured by Asclepios, and also the diseases which each of them suffered from, and how they; were cure d. The tablets are written in the Doric language. During excavations at Epidaurus in 1928 these six s tone: tablets were found, with the following messages of thanks: Ambrosia of Athens, one-eyed.

When she walked about the sanctuary, she laughed at some of the car es and thought it impossible that lame and blind people could become healthy when the y had only a dream.

When day broke, he came out cured, with the lance p oint in his hands. Hermodikos of Lampsakos, crippled in body. Asclepio s healed him when he slept in the cure room and ordered him when he came out to b ring the biggest stone he could find to the sanctuary. Then he brought the stone th at now lies in front of the sanctuary. Alketas of Halieis.He was blind and slept in the sa nctuary. When day broke, he came out cured. Arate of Laconia, dropsical.

He had swum out to sea and while diving reached a place from which there was no way out. So his father, as he co uld not find his son anywhere, slept in the cure room of Asclepios.... When he cam e out of the room ... he found the boy on the seventh day. The people who were miraculously cured 500 years B. C. behaved just the same as their counterparts today, and even the miracles wer e of the same quality as today, although the Christian guardians of 'genuine' mirac les are not at all keen to hear that. The god Asclepios does not stand alone as the chief witness for pre-Christian miraculous cures; he is in illustrious company. It is occasionally forgotten that Apollo was not on ly the god of radiant youth, poetry and music, but also the god of medicine and soothsa ying ... and the son of Asclepios. So he had been well trained. Apollo was a venerated god of healing, to whom a temple was erected in the sanctuary of Delphi in th e eighth century B.C. Naturally miracles happened in it. The dumb learnt to speak. Kidney-stones disappeared through the ureter in a mysteriously natural way. S hiny-headed Greeks prayed and hair grew luxuriantly on their pates[25]. (A clever speculator told me that after the invention of knitting needles and the zip fastener, there was only one invention left that could make anyone a millionaire - a genuine ha ir-restorer. Prayers to Asclepios and Apollo cannot be sold as cosmetic miracle worke rs by the most talkative Figaros in the world.) In the great sanctuaries of Thebes, the Egyptian ci ty of the Dead, the god of healing, Amphiraos, was worshipped - in the temple of Ptah a t Memphis votive stones were found on which cured patients extolled their gods. Frequently feet, legs and hands were perpetuated in stone to make their gratitude p ermanent. 376 stone ears were carved next to the image of the Ptah at Memphis [26 ]. A polycliaic for otology (ear therapy) must have been working overtime on miracle s there. *** Group experience is common to all these classical p laces of healing. I see in them predecessors of the psychodrama practised today in the sense in which Dr. Samuel Wamer [27] describes group therapy: Group therapy is often especially helpful, for it i s easier to recognize something mutually, and during the reciprocal relationship on e hand washes the other so to speak. ... This therapy is not only an intellectual experience; it also embraces the emotional life, for personality is formed by emotio nal experiences which are caused by the reaction of the glands and other subsidiary corporeal symptoms. In order to achieve a basic change of personality the therapy m ust make contact with these intensive, repeated and continuing emotional experi ences, so that the emotional spheres of the personality are affected again and u ndergo a tran-formation. This kind of group experience with a deliberate goa l could be sensed at all the places of pilgrimage I visited. The longing for a miracle - as a common emotional experience - released among complete strangers reciprocal rela tionships which extinguished any inhibitions, even against crying and lamenting alou d. People who were normally rather introverted underwent a change of personalit y. They surrendered themselves"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":" 108 completely to the general feeling. Here, at the goa l of their hopes, among the mass of anonymous sufferers a change in their attitude to t heir illness took place. It was now or never! At places of pilgrimage ecstatic emotions are the humus on which the apparently incredible can materialize. *** In this connection I should mention briefly 'animal magnetism' which was practised by the doctor Franz Anton Mesmer (1734-1815). Mesme r looked his patients fixedly in the eyes and then by laying on of hands used the powers radiating from people for suggestive cures. The Catholic Church has canonized thirty-five chirotetes (layers on of hands). The English surgeon James Braid (1795-18 60) realized that there was no occult hocus-pocus about successful healing by this method. He christened it hypnosis (Greek, sleep). Mesmerism became a European scourge , because people who did not possess healing magnetic powers also did a roaring trade in it. We can read in a report [28] published in 1784 the extent to which mass suggestion and mass hypnosis could effect 'miraculous cures': The Marquis of PuisSgur had turned his chateau near Sois-sons into a 'magnetic sanatorium'. A fanatic follower of Mesmer's methods , he used it to house people in search of a cure. The afflux of patients was enormo us: people were bursting out of the castle rooms. What could be done? The Marquis had a bright idea. He magnetized a stately elm tree in the village! 'suffering humanit y from both sides of the Rhine flocked to this magnetic tree as if to a wonder-wor king sacred image'. No comment. But reliquaries, mummified saints and m iracle-working statues of saints are not always necessary to effect miraculous cures . Old elm trees can do it too so long as the cure seekers 'believe' in them. Suggestion and hypnosis (as a form of suggestion) a re always present when miraculous cures take place at pilgrimage shrines, whether the Church admits it or not (and this applies equally to the 'genuine' miracles attested). Suggestion, to define it more accurately, is an influencing of the processes of thought, feeling and will, which 'leads to the uncritical acceptance of convictions, the suggestion of values and patterns of behaviour'. In the case of affective sympathy 'm an involuntarily opens himself to ... phenomenal forms and ideas .... Mass situations, as well as states of heightened excitement of the aftects, have a strengthening eff ect. ... Autosuggestion is self influencing by emotional hope and wishful thinking. ' What can hypnosis do? It can 'easily summon up illusions and hallucinations. Mem ory is released. Most people can be hypnotized if they are inwardly prepared.' These definitions are diagnoses of pilgrims at pilg rimage shrines. What does the Church say about this? It claims that 'the fact of the major miracle in th e Catholic Church (must) be established beyond doubt to the unprejudiced invest igator' [29]. I find this assessment by the Church to be inept, to say the least. If in our age that is so overloaded with neurotic organic diseases and physically harmful st ates of depression, only 100 cures"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":" 109 (even if they are not 'miracles') effected by sugge stion, autosuggestion and mass hypnosis are reported annually from all the places of pilgrimage, the church's media - Madonnas, relics, springs, etc. - fulfil a useful m iraculous purpose. Miraculous cures have been known since time immemor ial. Professor D. Langen [30] writes: Hypnosis as a psychic treatment of disease is extre mely ancient and can be found both in the medicine of the ethnic cultures (shamans) an d in the lofty civilizations of Egypt, Greece and Rome .... The trial was lost in the Midd le Ages. ... Franz Anton Mesmer marked the beginning of a new period that led to th e still valid suggestion theory of hypnosis by way of the theory of fluidum and magnet ismus ani-malis. ... Thought is concentrated on a narrowly defined point so that a relation between a hyper-awake core of consciousness and the remaining lowered sta tes of consciousness arises. While this state is maintained, thought is ordered to dir ect itself to a point or a complex of ideas and remain there. ... Consequently meditation is thought concentrated on a point in a sub-waking state of consciousness. By all the 12,000 saints! Cannot you see that all t he masses at places of pilgrimage concentrate their gaze on a 'point' say a statue of the Madonna? How they fall into a hypnotic trance by autosuggestion? Do you not feel in your bones how the general layer of consciousness sinks and simultaneously dwe lls on the miracle in a hyperactive state? Nearly every pilgrim has fallen into the power of mass suggestion from the start; should one of them remain outside i t, he would be caught in the undertow of the state of consciousness of the other s. 'Human individuals have an immediate effect on the Sensorium commune (common e motions).' [31] These are not Mr. von Daniken's suppositions, but a logical chain of evidence forged by doctors as a result of research .... It is true that the Church also admits 'natural' explanations, but it reserves to itself the recogni tion of 'genuine' miraculous cures performed by visions, with the co-operation of the Holy Family and the halleluya singing choir. Yogananda Paramahamsa [32] was one of the most famo us Yogis of our day. The world-wide Self Realization Fellowship he founded i n 1917 championed thoroughly sensible views which centre round one of the great Yogi's basic utterances: God helps those who help themselves. He has endowed you with will power and concentration, faith, reason and healthy commonsens e so that you can help yourselves in all corporeal and mental suffering. You must app ly all your faculties at the same time as you call on him for help. When you pray or practise healing meditation, always say to yourselves that he needs your own, bu t God-given, powers in order to heal you or others. Yogananda knows psychology's la ws of effect inside out. We can never know in advance when we shall be cured and so should not set any time limits to the process. Faith and not time will dete rmine when the cure is to take place. The end result depends on the correct awakening of the vital force and the conscious and unconscious disposition of the person concerned ."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":" 110 These insights of the Yogi's, to whom consecrated w ater (considered sacramental; it has a little salt mixed with it) is as alien as the joy of marriage still is to a Catholic priest, get to the very essence of miraculous cures , even though they stem from a totally unchristian faith, which is if anything a k nowledge of the vital processes of auto suggestive cures. Yogananda gives his fellowme n a hint about how it is exercised at all the sites of visions and miracles: Do not forget that you must say the healing words w ith the right emphasis, loudly at first and then more and more softly until you are o nly whispering, that close attention and concentration are especially necessary. In this way you lead your thoughts, the truth of which you are deeply convinced of, from th e aural sense into consciousness ... from there into the sub-conscious or automatic-cons cious. He who has the necessary faith will be healed by this method. I have never heard of Yogananda being at Lourdes or Fatima or any other visionary shrine, and I do not imagine he was. Yet his method is the one which is practised there. The crowds of people assemble in big squares , singing chorales in loud voices, saying the rosary or other devout prayers. The clos er they get to the miraculous spot, the lower the volume of the droning chorus. Their a ttention and concentration is directed at the goal. What they wish for is forced 'from the aural sense into consciousness'. From then on they only speak in whi spers and hymns are merely hummed. 'Faith' is wide-awake and concentrated. In most cases this faith in the effect of the metho d of healing satisfies faith in miracles at visionary sites. In fact, the subconscious (or ' automatic conscious') introduces electrochemical functions into the brain. 'When the nerve impulses ... enter the brain, they set off various chemical reactions' (Campbell) . Clinical tests of new drugs have proved time and ag ain that belief in the efficacy of a medicine can effect a cure. People are split into t wo control groups. One is given the new drug, the other a placebo (a harmless imitation of the new medicine, generally 'scented' sugar-coated pills of the same size and c olour). Leslie M. LeCron describes the result: 'It is observed that a large part of th e control group given the placebo reacts in exactly the same way as the group which has take n the real drug. This effect is attributable to suggestion.' That which Yogananda Paramahamsa calls faith, will- power and concentration in connection with the healing effect, the doctor call s exactly what it is: suggestion. Yogi and doctor are far away from the highfalutin Christ ian talk about miracles but they know how 'miracles' happen. *** It is the obstinacy, the partial blindness, I canno t understand. Theologians have still not clearly stated facts about 'miracles' that have been known for over 450 years. Theophratus Bombastus von Hohenheim (1494-1541), kn own as Paracelsus, was the founder of a new science of healing. He emphasized the primacy of the 'soul' (today we would use the word 'psyche') in normal life and illness, and was the first to recognize the previously overlooked pathological co nnections and new types of"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":" 111 illness, such as neuroses and psychoses. In the cen tre he placed man as microcosm. Healing to Paracelsus was the work of the life forc e and the will to live. Quotations from his treatise on Imaginatio [33] shows how mode rn his views were: Man is subject to imagination, and the imagination although invisible and inconceivable works corporeally in a substance. The imagination can cause disease, terrible disease , and it can cause happiness and health. Hence it follows that the imagination is more than nature and governs it. It removes innate qualities so that it knows neither heaven no r earthly nature. Hence it follows that a great deal is impossible fo r the doctor, and the more powerful the imagination, the weaker the effect of the docto r. Consequently many people get well through the belie f of the imagination, but many people get sick also. By such imagining (arises) belief both in the mirac les of the saints and in the medicines... that makes them well and is attributed by them to saints and miracles... although it is all the results of belief in the ima gination. Whether the belief is right or wrong, depends solel y on the strength of the imagination. And even if a false prophet manages to influence pe ople, who consider him blessed or saintly, and credit him with results, because their love and hope is concentrated on their faith, these miracles will happen not through his power, but through the power of those who believe so strongly. The sum total of the advances of scholars such as A ristotle, John Locke, David Hume and Carl Jung provides the explanation of all that was supposed inexplicable. Even if we are not familiar with these pioneers and their p upils, their insights have become part of our everyday existence. *** One 'miracle' was explained to me by the roadside. One spring, while I was driving along the shores of the Bodensee, through the breat htakingly lovely trees in bloom, I remembered my visit to 'Mama Rosa' in San Damiano i n March, and the miracle performed by the 'beautiful lady' of making a pear tree flower in October 1964. I parked by the roadside, explained the facts briefly to a fruit-farmer and asked if he had any experience of such a state of affairs - fru it and blossoms on the tree simultaneously. He nodded and said they called it a 'magic bloom', but did not know how it occurred. Nevertheless I had learnt that the flowering of Mama Rosa's tree in October was not unique, and could not be 'breaking the laws of nature' in the sense of an ecclesiastically acceptable miracle. I sought information from botanist friends."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":" 112 Pear trees and indeed plum trees belong to the fami ly of Rosaceae. The pear tree is one of the deepest rooted species: it needs warm so il, into which the roots penetrate up to a depth of nine feet. The subsoil water shoul d not rise above this height, as pear trees are sensitive to subsoil water. Plum tree flo urish best on medium damp soil, but need a warm climate, like the related pear tree. An annual rainfall of about 600 mm is enough for both trees. In such conditions the fruit ripens with the steady passage of the seasons. It does especially well in a climate l ike that south-west of Milan. This rhythm is sensibly disturbed if an unseasonabl e cold spell occurs, with unusually high rainfall and subsequent warm spells, like the Italian autumn, say. Owing to the cold shock, and the rain - both happened in the Mil an region in September 1964! - the trees behave as if it were spring: owing to the col d and the damp soil the biochemical processes of metabolism begin and flower hormones a re formed. If the trees are then subjected to autumn solar warmth again, we have the botanical and physiological 'miracle' of an autumn bloom on the tree simultaneo usly with fruit. The blossoms 'suddenly' stop and fall equally quickly; they bear no fruit because the bees have long since disappeared. If the coupling of enzymes and hormones in the grow th of plants is still a mystery. Mama Rosa's flowering pear and plum trees are certa inly not a divine miracle, but a clearly explicable process, which the Bodensee fann er simply called 'magic bloom'. Miracles fall to the ground from the tree of knowle dge just as quickly as that! *** 'The sick man is God's gift to us, a direct favour and must be accepted by us as such. He (the sick man!) is an example of God's special f avour because he enables us to put into practice that candour of heart called compassi on ...' [34]. So says Lad-islaus Boros, a Jesuit instructor in divinity at Innsbruck . Anyone who is not yet sick is bound to be made ill by such theological tripe. But this kind of dubious 'soul massage' is inflicted on us from childhood. The unreal conce pt of 'original sin' is on the heels of every Christian, shadowing his every action. It req uires tremendous courage for anyone who has been brought up in this doctrine to liberate himself inwardly from all these threats. One should also mention the theme of the sexual rep ression of Christians. Obviously getting rid of it also forms part of the act of sel f-liberation, but it is not the key to the door to personal freedom and self-responsibility vi s-a-vis moral laws. Sigmund Freud's once revolutionary thesis that everyone and everything was intelligible in terms of the instinctual life has long been overtak en by new scientific insights. 2,000 years of Christian tradition with the refinem ent of its dogmas lie deep in the subconscious. The moving Jesus legend with the suff ering Mary, the suffering Apostles, and the suffering saints is also stored i n the brain-cells of non-practising Christians. But for the practising Christian this brain program ming implies a lasting readiness to believe in miracles and miraculous cures as proof o f God's grace. Before a religious 'Lazarus' has taken part in a pilgrimage to a visio nary shrine, he had been brain-"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":" 113 washed. His family, friends and priests have made i t abundantly clear to him why the pilgrimage is the 'last resort'. Day and night the pain-racked sufferer is preoccupied with the hope of the miracle that has been suggeste d to him. If the children of Fatima or little Bernadette at Lourdes have helped others, why not me, too? On the sickbed - effective pious therapy - hymns to Mary are sung, t he Rosary is recited. The sufferer has no idea that perhaps a self-healing process has already begun, that he himself has set the healing mechanism (Bio Feedback) in motion. The skilful preparatory work done in the sickroom i s enhanced at the visionary shrine by the feelings shared by the anonymous masses who also believe in miracles. One is much more likely to 'perceive' Jesus, Mary and the saints at the goals of the journey than in Christian everyday life or in one's home ch urch. From time to time, cures take place for motivations that we know, just as they do in other countries with quite different conditions and religions. There are several thousand 'faith healers' in Ameri ca, Europe and Asia. Among the dozens of such people I met, I found helpful, often shy, always modest people who followed their calling without religious rites or p retentious ceremonials. Naturally they accept a fee for their work: they are not sain ts and cannot live on air and love. I was Sceptical about the undefined physical and medi cinal powers employed by them. So I arranged to meet the dynamic young faith-heale r Marcus Brogler, who is well- known in Switzerland, my home country, at a restaur ant in Aarau. I teased him and asked if he really believed in his magic. Marcus go t up and stood behind me. 'Sit still I am not going to touch you.' I drank my beer. In les s than a minute I felt as if someone was ironing my spine with a red-hot iron. I turned round. Marcus returned to his seat, ordered another round and asked sarcastically: 'Did you feel the magic?' Alas, we live in a maze of magic and miracles. Like bread fresh from the oven, some of it baked and some of it half- baked, books pour off the presses, books dealing with the mysteriously working powers of telekinesis and telepathy and trying to explain how the miracles are done, books that tell us about the work of faith-surgeons on the Philippines and till the vast field of parapsycholo gy. It would be carrying coals to Newcastle if I were to make a further contribution to these fields. So I am going to stick to the territory I have prescribed for myself - visions. *** Yogananda Paramahamsa, who made such intelligent re marks about suggestive healing, died in Los Angeles on 7th March, 1952. It is said that after three weeks his body showed no signs of decomposition - as is often supposed to be the case after the death of a saintly man. Harry T. Rowe, Director of Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Los Angeles, said in an official report [35]: 'The abse nce of any signs of decomposition on Paramahamsa's body is the most extraordinary case i n all our experience. ... Even twenty days after his death no trace of corporeal d ecay could be observed .... No smell of decomposition could be noticed throughout this p eriod ....' The stuff of which saints are made!"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":" 114 Inge Santner writes in Die Weltwoche [36], Zurich, about a lecture given to the Viennese Catholic Academy by the Viennese psychiatr ist and neurologist, Dr. Gerhard Kaiser, Lecturer in Forensic Medicine at Sa lzburg University. Dr. Kaiser tackled the question of why the bodies o f saints retain their shape decades or centuries after their death. Kurt Tucholsky[37] gives a wonderful account of Lourdes in his Book of the Pyrenees: They have recently exhumed her (Bernadette Soubirou s) for her canonization next year. Her body was well preserved, her left eye, wh ich was directed at the vision, is reputed to have remained open and her tomb to have smelt so strongly of flowers that letters which lay there smelt, too, so it was said at Lourdes .... (Bernadette was not a saint at the time; she did no t become one till 1933.) In the opinion of the Viennese scientist it does no t need a miracle to preserve the fleshly envelope so that it survives the decades or centuries without visible signs of decomposition. Dr. Kaiser examined such cases as th ese: Francis of Sales, who died in 1622, was found 'as i f he was alive' when exhumed in 1632. His body did not turn to dust until 1665 when it emitted an 'extraordinarily sweet smell'. Francis Caracciola died in 1608. His flesh and sine ws were unchanged when he was exhumed in 1628. When an incision was made, blood f lowed from it. Carlos Borromaus, died 1584, proved 'unnaturally su pple' after medical examination in 1608. His corpse still looked exactly the same 2 50 years later, in 1880. St. John of the Cross, who died in 1591, was found covered with pinkish skin when he was dug up in 1859 (!), sweet smelling fluid kept h is body moist. Maria Magdelena de Pazzi, died 1607, did exhibit a blackened face when she was exhumed in 1663, but she still had an 'exceptionall y mild expression'. Bernadette Soubirous, who died in 1879, seemed to b e merely sleeping when she was exhumed; her face was only slightly browned and eve n her clothing had survived the ravages of time undamaged. Astounding, uncanny, miraculous facts? Dr. Gerhard Kaiser says: 'Wherever the course of events can be reconstructed, signs of mir aculous activity must be almost certainly excluded.' These are the scientific facts: Bodily reactions are not uncommon after death. Cess ation of heart beat does not influence all cells simultaneously. Whole groups of cells survive it for several hours. Spermatozoa continue mobile for at least twenty-eig ht hours after the death of the organism. A well-known phenomenon are the (uncanny) sighs given by dead people when they are dressed for their last journey and mo ved in the process. Survivors are"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":" 115 often horrified when they observe changes in positi on caused by heat. Suspended animation? When a pregnant woman dies, the foetus c an be expelled from the body by putrefying gases in the coffin. Suspended animat ion? No, a chemical and physical process. Normally the process of decomposition begins very s oon after the definite signs of death (coldness of the corpse, rigor mortis, cessat ion of heart beat and breathing, reddish blue spots on the skin, a negative curve on the instruments). A bubble-like raising of the skin and formation of gas - often wi th considerable pressure in the corporeal orifices — soon ensues. The process of putrefaction is mainly caused by air . It carries bacteria, and oxygen sets the chemical conversion process in motion. Moi sture and warmth accelerate the decomposition and finally, under ground, worms and insects complete the work of destruction. Ants can lay a skeleton bare in three days! Generally the abdomen dissolves in three or four years, fat in the bones much later. Brain cells and skin on the head last for decades. The protein in the bones las ts for a hundred years or more. Ultimately all that survives of a dead person burie d in a normal grave is the skeleton. Saintly men who have already demonstrated their sin gularity in their lifetime by spectacular deeds, are obviously not buried in norm al graves or tombs. That is the vital premise from which Dr. Kaiser comes to his co nvincing conclusions. The most important prerequisite for the preservatio n of a corpse is keeping bacteria away. If their presence can be stopped or lessened, the process of putrefaction is slowed down considerably. But how can the environme nt be influenced to decrease or prevent the access of destructive bacteria? Dry air and constant strong draughts produce a natu ral mummification which preserves parts of the body with little flesh on th em (ears, nose, fingers, toes). Cold water flowing in the vicinity of the corpse ke eps the temperature down and drives flies and insects away. This preservative bacteria-reducing cold can be inc reased by ice. (Bodies have been recovered from glaciers completely undamaged after many years.) Forensic medicine has histories of corpses found in pitch lakes that were discoloured, but perfectly preserved. Also well known are bog corpses which are preserved by humus acids resistant to putrefaction. Carbon dioxide prevents the coagulati on of the blood. In cases of carbon dioxide poisoning blood can flow from cuts long aft er death. Metal coffins cause the formation of metallic salts , which slow down decomposition for as much as ten years. Salts in the earth (arsen ic from the iron sources), or sea salts in combination with the dry climate accounted for t he hundreds of skulls buried during the Inca period which were found with undama ged flesh and all their hair during excavations in the Lima region. The preserva tion of bodies by treating them with natron, asphalt and cedar products was known i n Egypt from the third century"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":" 116 B.C. (Today it is simpler. We mummify with formalin , a germ-killing medium. In many American Memorial Parks relatives can pull the ir beautifully made-up dead out of compartments and contemplate them in all their l iving beauty. ... Death in Hollywood!) Dr. Kaiser has no doubt that the majority of incorr uptible saints were buried in such conditions. The survival of Rose of Lima's flesh was unquestion ably due to salts. (The nun, who remained undamaged for eighteen months, lay in the same salt-bearing earth in which the Inca skulls were found.) St. Clara of Monte Falco was mummified by dry air a nd found with an 'exceptionally beautiful face'. Her shorn hair hung above her as a relic 'apparently dried out and showing the face of the crucified Christ'. The 'smoked Parson of St. Thomas' in lower Austria was rendered incorruptible by chemicals - tar products. Was it pure chance that saintly people found their burial place in surroundings so favourable to their preservation? There is evidence that suitable methods were used to help preserve the bodies of saints 'in the flesh'. Capuchins in Italy and Moravians laid out the burial chambers of their monasteries in suc h a way that a constant draught of dry air swept through them. Dr. Kaiser's suppositio n that the bodies of many saints were not only embalmed with essences, sweet-smellin g oils, salves and aromas to drive away the smell of death, but also because the preservative effect of 'cosmetics' was known, can be accepted as a certainty. When the bodies of illustrious ecclesiastics turned to dust after being exposed to profane human eyes, it was definitely not a 'sign f rom God', according to Dr. Kaiser. Once the grave was opened, the conditions restraini ng decomposition created at the time of interment were interrupted and ended. For e xample, St. Vincent de Paul crumbled to bits as the result of a sudden influx o f air when his coffin was opened twenty-five years after his burial. 'Rediscovered t ombs of ordinary Etruscans, to whom no one attributed particular saintliness, show ed the same phenomenon. The corpses which rested undamaged on their stone beds, turned into dust during the exploration of the catacombs. A sweet-smelling gold en haze is supposed to have filled the room.' If the wealthy Catholic Church, which is so worried about the inviolability and divine exaltation of its saints, were to set up a research foundation to examine the post- mortem remains of holy bodies on a broader basis, I should think it an excellent idea and a brave gesture. Then perhaps we should have an answer some day to t he Viennese scholar's tricky question: 'Why should God preserve the bodies of pr ecisely those men whose souls he took to himself by the shortest way?' ***"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":" 117 Even Jesus, the Master, did not believe in miracles ... but he knew the effect of suggestion! Mark (5:23 et seq.) tells us that a woman who lay a t the point of death came to him. Jesus' fame as a miraculous healer, preceded him an d prepared the ground for his direct suggestions. He was asked to lay his hands o n her so that she could be cured, for she had suffered from an 'issue of blood' for t welve years. She had spent a lot of money on doctors who had been unable to help her. A s usual the crowd surrounded the master expectantly.

The prerequisite of her readiness to be healed mira culously existed. 'And straight away the fountain of her blood was dr ied up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague.' Jesus knew exactly whence the effect attributed to him came, for he asked who had touched his clothes. 'And he looked around to see her that had done this thing' (32). The miraculous healer explained the mystery of the cure in a very modern and relevant way! 'Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in pe ace and be whole of the plague.' The Nazarene knew nothing about the mechanism of au to, or heterosuggestion, but he had a good idea of their miraculous effects. If pre sent-day faith-healers take the Bible as a textbook, they can find many good hints in it. 'No one really likes suffering. If he does, he is not really suffering but submissively e njoying his pain. Enjoying the blows as absolutely necessary for his psychic expansion. The martyred look of suffering appears to be calm and even shows a sneaking feelin g of gratitude,' says Ernest Bloch [38] and his assertions tally with my observations. *** When I am urged to show more respect for religions, I can assure people with conviction and from the heart that I respect every religion which also respects its followers. But where the ignorance of church members is despis ed and shamelessly exploited, where hocus-pocus goes on with miracles that are no t miracles, where jingling coins are struck from manipulated faith, where religions coerce adherents in this world by threats of punishment in the world to come, in all such cases I cannot respect religions, whatever their nature.

The impulse for producing visions is of extraterres trial origin. Religious visions originate through an ideal that t he visionary has within him and is suggested by his religious environment. Do these theses of mine conceal a mass of contradic tions? It might appear so at first sight. But in order to provide proofs for my theses , I must build on the basis of my theory. Present-day astrophysics puts forward three theorie s of the origin of the universe [1]: the Big Bang theory, the Steady State theory and th e Oscillation theory. None of these three (or other) theories on the origin of the worl d explains where the mysterious original matter of the whole universe comes from an d what was present before it came into being. Nothing originates from nothing. Just as it does not matter for my thesis which of t hese theories may ultimately turn out to be valid, it is also unimportant to me whether t he origin of the universe dates back five, ten or twenty milliard years, or whether matt er is finite or infinite, or whether it constantly renews itself. My question is: what did original matter originate from? In public discussions I have made use of a graphic image to explain my views on this question in simple terms. I suggested that my heare rs imagine a computer with a hundred milliard thought-units (bits in computer ja rgon), a computer that can think, i.e. has a 'personal consciousness' (Professor Mich ie, Edinburgh University). This consciousness is attached to milliards of circuits: it would be destroyed if the computer exploded. Our computer is highly intellige nt and capable of, ultra-rapid combinations. There is nothing it does not know. In spite of its consciousness and omniscience the t hinking computer is not 'happy', for in spite of its tremendous performance there is som ething it cannot think out, reckon out or work out, namely experience. But it wants to amass experience. As it has no rival of anything like the same calibre to obtain e xperience from, it decides to send the hundred milliard bits off its central body out to g et information by exploding itself knowing perfectly well that it would definitely los e its personal consciousness by so doing ... if it had not in its insuperable cleverne ss programmed the future after its self- destruction long beforehand.

From the moment of the explosion to the moment of t he return no bit 'knew' that it was and would now be again a minute part of a large r consciousness. If a single bit with its minimal capacity for thought could ask the question: 'What is the purpose of my breakneck journey?' or 'Who created me, where do I come from?', there would be no answer. Thus the tremendous journey was the begi nning and end of an act, a kind of 'creation' of consciousness multiplied by the fa ctor EXPERIENCE. This bold comparison from the arsenal of science-fi ction is meant as an aid in tracking down the phenomenon which existed before original m atter. Terrible simplificateur! I beg your pardon, but it gets us a little further. All human traditions assure us that 'spirit' (or th e comprehensive synonym 'God') was 'there' before any beginning, i.e. before the origi n of matter. The (original) spirit then decided to become matter, to transform itself. (... and the word was made flesh ...) 'Spirit' is not tangible or measurable with instrum ents. How are we to imagine it? In a gaseous state? This is scarcely possible, gas molec ules are already matter. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that 'spirit', that mysterious unknown IT, transformed itself into a gaseous aggregation during the first stage of its materialization. This assumption no longer smacks of science-fiction , for every astrophysical theory of the origin of the universe begins with the gaseous state of the original matter - with gas molecules, which slowly and steadily combine to form lumps of matter. But if a gaseous state was the proven original state [2] of all matter and the original spirit, that simply means that all existing matter was permeated by the original spirit, a claim that is manifest in all theosophical and esoteric religi ons. Then, to put it crudely, matter would be crystallized sublimated spirit. It makes no difference which kind of matter one thi nks of -lava, rock, plants, animals or men - they ultimately all come from the same ori ginal state. It even makes no difference whether we postulate matter from our pla net, Jupiter, Alpha Centauri or the Andromeda Nebule. Matter is creation per se and its elf the product of creation. Matter has transversed a million fold paths of evol ution. A stone, product of the same origin and the same original state, can ask itself no questions. But life clearly develops from 'dead' matter, there is no longer the slightes t academic doubt about that. Living matter, say a cell, develops over millions of years into complicated organisms. Development and reactions by organisms are governed by brains with their grey mass of mil-hardfold cells: they produce 'personal consc iousness' by chemical and electrical conversions of matter. Intelligence does not appear until after the existence of personal consciousness which can ask questions. (De scartes: 'Cogito, ergo sum' - I think, therefore I am.) So according to the history of evolution, intellige nce is superior to any matter below its state of consciousness. Matter is dominated by it. Intelligence is more closely related to the original spirit than dead matter - i ntelligence can communicate with one another, they can ask questions at a high level: 'W ho created me?

The y may seek for the 'spirit', for the IT, synonym for creator or god, but they do not 'realize' that what they seek is around them and in them. A fanciful idea? I leave it to the scientists to answer that questio n. *** Sir Arthur Eddington (1882-1944), English Astronome r and physicist, Director of the Cambridge Observatory, [3] discovered the pulsation theory of the Cephids. Eddington championed a 'selective subjectivism', of natural laws, in that he assumed that the basic physical laws are essentially determ ined by the structure of the process of knowledge and asserted that the matter of the wo rld is the matter of the spirit. The natural philosopher Bernhard Bavink (1879-1947) , who strove to close the gap between natural science and religion, held the foll owing view [4]: The material organization of the world appears to u s today as perhaps the transient manifestation of an entirely spiritual concept. Max Planck (1858-1947), who opened up new paths to physics with his quantum theory and won the Nobel Prize for physics in 1918, admitted: As a physicist, i.e. as a man who has devoted his l ife to the most matter of fact branch of science, namely, the investigation of matter, I am surely free of any suspicion of fanaticism. And so after my research into the atom I say this to you: there is no such thing as matter per ser All matter originates from and consists of a force which sets the atomic particles in oscillation and concentrate s them into the minute solar system of the atom. But as there is neither an intelligenc e nor an internal force in the whole universe, we must assume a conscious intelligent sp irit behind this force. This spirit is the basic principle of all matter .... Sir James Hopwood Jeans (1877-1946), English mathem atician, physicist and astronomer, who was mainly a pioneer in the fields of thermodynamics, stellar dynamics and cosmogony, was especially famous for h is theory of the origin of the planets.[5] Sir James wrote: Today scholars are fairly unanimous and physicists almost completely unanimous in saying that the whole current of knowledge is movin g in the direction of a non- mechanical kind of reality. The Universe gradually looks more like a great thought than a great machine. If matter is a product of 'spirit' and vice-versa s pirit a product of matter, are spirit and matter of the same nature only in a different state of aggregation? Fifty years ago people used to ask if energy could be converted int o matter. Einstein's formula E = mc<2> gave the world-shattering answer. The hydroge n bomb was a proof that could not be overlooked or unheard. Might we ask today if 'crystallized' spirit can be set free?"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":" 122 The analogical conclusion is obvious. Matter is jus t as much a form of energy as 'crystallized' spirit. Consequently spirit is simul taneously energy and energy simultaneously spirit. Consciousness, defined as un doubtedly related to the 'spirit', must be another (if as yet unknown) form of energy. The Dutch physicist and mathematician Christiaan Hu ygens (1629-1695) is considered as the founder of the 'energy principle' , according to which all the energy in the universe is constant and all forms of energy are convertible into each other. Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894) and Albert Einste in (1879-1955) amplified this basic principle. If we accept consciousness as a fo rm of energy (and all current research supports this conclusion), then the proven energy principle can be applied to it, too. As the totality of all energy must remain constant, this (to me) conclusive line of proof means no more and no less than that consci ousness is immortal! Energy is never lost, cannot disappear, cannot die and cannot dissolve into the void - it is always converted into another form of energy. Converted energy is not what it was before. In deat h consciousness loses its original energetic activity, is no longer 'consciousness', b ut converted energy. (Steam is another state of ice and ice is another state of wa ter. Steam, ice and water are easily changed into one of the other forms, yet their effe cts are quite different from each other). Is the ultima ratio, the last logical consequence t hat ALL is one and ONE is ALL? If that is so - and what contradicts this logic? - mus t it not be possible for the conscious intelligent form of energy to affect the unconsciou s? It is happening all round us at every minute with the help of technology and mechan ics. When the lumberjack fells a tree, he applies his conscious intelligent energy t o make the immovable tree fall. Through his conscious intelligent energy the smith uses other forms of energy (fire, hammer, anvil) to force the iron into a new shape. Conscious intelligent energy uses all the appropria te known ways of converting energy for the specific case. If mechanics and tech nology complete conversion processes as a matter of course without conscious i ntelligence, surely a conscious intelligent form of energy must be capable of causi ng the desired reactions in other forms of energy? The above question is really superfluous because su ch reactions have been constantly produced in the history of humanity and still are t oday. There have always been men who tracked down the secrets which 'the energy-beas t-brain' concealed and then, consciously or unconsciously, astonished their fell owmen by new knowledge and power which they used to help and advance them. But when such knowledge and power are used today to create new religions and 'f reshen up' old ones, I call it the most infamous kind of modern gangsterism, because r uthless game is being played with ignorant people. *** Dr. Albert Freiherr von Schrenck-Notzing (1862-1929 ) is considered to be the founder of parapsychology, which is so popular toda y. He knew perfectly well the"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":" 123 attacks he was exposing himself to when he publishe d his account of apparitions, which developed in the presence of a medium in the form of a cloud-like mass (tele or ectoplast). Dr. Schrenck-Notzing had himself co-ope rated in Rome and Paris in the exposure of charlatans, who feigned materialization s by using concealed aids. He knew all the tricks which self-styled mediums used to lead séance audiences up the garden path. Eva C was the doctor's subject for observation. In 1909 séances were held in the Paris home of the dramatist Alexander Bisson (1848-1912). Several people participated, including doctors, as they did later in Munich and London. Eva C's clothing, as well as the lighting, door locks, composition of the wal ls etc., were constantly checked. Before they began Eva C showed herself in the nude. Madame Bisson gave her a gynaecological examination; her perineum and anus w ere explored. 'Before each séance the author examined the hair, nostrils (air was blown through them), the external ear channels, the oral orifices, teeth, ar mpits, feet, the state of hands and fingernails ... the objection that the medium could have small rolled up pellets somewhere on her person seems to be unfounded.' After these extremely detailed searches the wretche d Eva C was sewn into the dark robe that she had never touched before. 'If one tak es into account the fact that the medium had nothing white on her body (neither blous e nor handkerchief) the grey and white materializations against the black background are convincing.' Schrenck-Notzing made use of a technical innovation of the time: flash photographs with pulverized magnesium. These sometimes nauseati ng photographs are shown as proof in his book Materializations-Phanonemene [6]. What actually happened at these mediumistic séances ? Some examples from the records: 17th May, 1910 ... To the accompaniment of deep res pirations and convulsive muscular efforts a large, streaked, flocculent subs tance formed directly before my eyes and seemed to flow from her mouth, getting big ger and thicker. The substance may have been five to eight centimeters wide and fo rty to fifty centimeters long. I moved my head about fifteen to twenty centimeters n earer to observe more clearly and saw this sluggish moving mass, like a heap of t he finest striped grey veils, slowly sink down. It followed every movement that the medi um made with her head and yet- seemed to separate itself from it .... To our aston ishment we could no longer make out any facial features, for the whole head was envelop ed in a big veil-like cloud from which light-coloured tatters and strips hung down o ver her breasts and down to the knee. This image vanished before our eyes, as when a cloud dissolves, and her face was clearly visible again .... 1st June, 1910 ... D uring the next apparition the light coloured materialization first came out of her lap and right hip .... Her mouth had no connection with the substance; I convinced myself o f this by putting my finger in her mouth .... 2nd September, 1910 ...

Professor Charles Richet (1850-1935) was present at the séance of 5th November, 1910. This French doctor recognized the protective action of the blood in infected experimental animals and discovered anaphylaxy. (*) He won the Nobel Prize for this in 1913. Today the stance began at once with the phenomena . ... In the place where the mass of grey matter had thickened most, we saw a white glea m shot with pink, looking like white chiffon or veiling. At nearly all the Paris séances doctors from every conceivable faculty were present, and also scientists such as Professor Fontenay, who checked the physical data. During the séances in Munich Dr. von Schrenck invited lect urers at the University such as Dr. Specht and Dr. Kafka. During the years Eva C produced outlines of figures and clearly recognizable photographically recorded faces. Sceptical Paris an d London doctors examined the medium thoroughly, even looking under her skin. The y also checked her immediate surroundings, but the phenomena were repeated no ma tter what the conditions. Eva C came from a comfortable home; she had no mone y problems. She never accepted payment and appeared willingly before all kinds of doctors, and even journalists.

Seances were held there under the s trictest scientific conditions. At the séances of 10th May, 1920, four cameras were used, including a stereoscopic camera. One exposure showed 'a small hand on the le ft shoulder', another 'a flickering mass of light'. On 28th May Eva's head was sewn up in a veil and the audience 'realized that the object was forced out of her mou th through the veil'.

The Nobel Prizewinner Charles Richet wrote to Dr. v on Schrenck-Notzing: As far as my former experiments are concerned, I do not wish to retract a word. And I refer to that great and noble scholar William Crook es, who only recently said: 'I take nothing of what I have said back.' Criticism must b e exercised, that is a condition of science. In due course the truth will come to light in all its beauty, but it will not be brought to light by incompetents and ignoramuses, w ho have seen nothing, checked nothing, examined nothing, indeed have not even rea d the record carefully, but rather by the scholars who have really worked and experime nted without cease, who prefer truth to probability .... It is surely not our faul t if the metaphysical field offers so many improbabilities and contradictions. ... To the extent that the documentation of Eva C's cas e is available, it can be objectively stated that the theory of cheating is not tenable, that Eva C complied with the requirements of the scientific boards, that well ov er a hundred people observed and confirmed the materializations. One of Dr. Schenck- Notzing's arguments seems convincing to me. Why should Eva C have exposed her self to the gruesome tests described without getting any material benefits fro m them? There are large numbers of cases of materialization for which validity is c laimed, but Eva C's case has kept its special position to the present day, because none o f the others was so painstakingly recorded and documented. For that reason it constan tly reappears as an example in the scientific literature of parapsychology. There remains the final comment on Eva C's case by Professor Mikuska, University of Genoa: So it is reserved for an occult biology of the futu re to research into the mystery of life, the connection between spirit and matter, soul and body, the living and the lifeless. Already today we are shown that the spirit, the ide a, the will is the driving agent behind teleplastic manifestations and we hope that in the not too distant future it will bring us closer to the great mystery of how the uni verse in its totality, and cosmic processes in the infinity of their development and perfection, originate through creative acts of will by the universal spirit. Materializations of the kind so common with Eva C h ave nothing to do with spiritualism (*) and very little to do with the occ ult, (+) for the phenomenal apparitions were visible, tangible and could be pho tographed. What happened and was checked in the case described is certainly not a unique case. I do not doubt the documentary reports of Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing and his fellow-scientists. Instead I ask a question which was not yet topical at that ti me: what form of energy was involved?"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":" 126 ---- [*] Spiritualism says that reported phenomena ate t raceable to the intervention of the spirit world in this world.

The subconscious as a form of energy (for the production of materializations) is conceivable, eve n though not yet proved. But could converted forms of the energy of dead people perhap s be involved? That supposition is not so absurd as it may seem; if anything it is a logical continuation of the 'energy principle' into virtually virgin territory. If all forms of energy are convertible into one another - one of the few completely accepted and in disputable laws of nature! - the conscious energies of dead people must also be conv ertible. For thousands of years we knew nothing about what h appened to consciousness after death, apart from vague philosophical and religious speculations. (The 'soul' goes up to heaven. Thus immortality was already ascribed to the consciousness = soul!) Modern research is on the point of carefully removi ng the dark cloths which were spread over a supposedly inexplicable mystery, and what it has already brought to light appears to show that the consciousness (ergo, conscious energy) of the dead is by no means 'dead'! Might the conscious energies of dead people have been active during the 'host miracle' at Carabandal on the nigh t of 18th July, 1962, when a host- like object materialized on the tongue of the girl Conchita? What stage has the exploitation of these phenomena reached today? Suspended animation occurs when the breath stops ow ing to paralysis of the breathing centre (asphyxia), in myocardial infarctions, in in juries resulting from accidents (traumas), in poisoning and after convulsions, etc. As Jean-Baptiste Dala-court[7] says, everyone who recovers from suspended animatio n testifies that during their temporary stay in 'the other world' they retained c onsciousness of a quite different kind from their 'living' consciousness. The other w orld is perceived as timeless, as a world of oscillations, harmonies and colours, as a world in which countless consciousnesses communicate with each other, carry on conversations with each other and, although incorporeal and without sensory organ s, can see other people and swap memories with them. Everyone who has come back from the 'other side' has found their abrupt return to the harsh cold facts of mort al life burdensome and repugnant. Everything was so infinitely more beautiful 'over t here'. Doctors say that such descriptions by resuscitated persons are irrelevant and worthless as statements about 'another world', because levels of consciousness continue to function in the brains of those in suspended animat ion and dredge up into their consciousness illusory pictures of a fairy-tale wor ld from the deeper brain levels."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":" 127 If the doctors are right, I find it a terrifying id ea.

But what about the conscious energies of people who have been dead for many long years? *** In 1964 the Swede Friedrich Jurgenson [8] claimed t hat he had succeeded in capturing the voices of people long dead with the help of mic rophones and tapes. This phenomenon fascinated the critical parapsychol ogist Dr. Constantin Raudive, born in Latvia in 1909, who left his home as a youn g man and studied in Paris and Madrid, where his meeting with Ortega y Gasset (188 3-1955) became a decisive experience in his life. (Ortega advocated the anthr opological theory that the 'spirit' forms the core of personality.) Raudive spent four years checking Jurgenson's claim s. He had an absolutely sound- proof recording studio built and worked with magnet ized records which even cut out the minimal background noise of microphones and car tridges. In 1968 Raudive [9] published the results of his experiments, which had all taken place under scientifically controlled conditions. Hundreds of observers confir med the accuracy of his methods, among them figures such as Professor Hans Bender, D irector of the Institut fur Grenzwissenchaften, Freiburg, the physicist Dr. G. Ronicke, Julian Blieber, PhD, Dr. Arnold Reincke, Dr. Hans Naegeli, President of the Swiss Parapsychological Society, Professor Atis Teichmanis, Professor Werner Brunner , a surgeon from Zurich, Professor Alex Schneider, St. Gall, Pro-fessor Walt er H. Uphoff, Boulder, U.S.A., Dr. Jule Eisenbund, Denver, U.S.A., Dr. Wilhelmine C. H ennequin, specialist in an- aesthesia, Dr. R. Fatzer, Wadenswill, Switzerland, etc., etc. Constantin Raudive recorded 72,000 voices! Alex Sch neider, Professor of Physics at the Eidgenossischen Technischen Hochschule, Switzer land, said on the subject: Provisionally physics has no objections to make to the voice phenomena. At all events we shall be waiting tensely for the result of furth er investigations, as they will enlarge our knowledge of electromagnetic radiation. Anyone can hunt down voices in his own home without great expense. This is the rough recipe. You choose a time and a room with as little external noise as possible. Alone or with others you pick up the microphone and call on dead persons (or 'spirits') to announce themselves. The tape should be running. You wait and repeat your appeal to those on the other side in half a minute. You wa it again. You should not keep this up for more than half an hour. You rewind the tape and if you have made contact, y ou hear hastily spoken words in different languages. The scraps of language receive d are babbled so fast that at first you have to take a good deal of trouble to pick wor ds and sentences out of the"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":" 128 confused mixture of your own voice, room noises and interference. Sounds, words and fragments of sentences are often hissed and som etimes only whispered. They are spoken by different voices. You should write down what you pick up, because onl y then can you recognize languages, dialects and logograms. You get the best results if you play identified voices on to a second tape and cut out waiting peri ods, background noise, etc. in the process. I should like to destroy the hope that you can under-stand communications from the voices en clair, as it were. There is a lo t of turbulence in the ether! Aunt Emma's great-great-grandfather follows close on the heels of Nietzsche, and soon after that comes the voice of Caruso or a dead frie nd. A characteristic feature is that no one voice lets another finish what it is saying. They must be a garrulous lot in the other world, too. The following is a practical method of receiving vo ices. You connect the microphone cable of the tape recorder to the radio and choose a setting between two transmitters. The procedure has the disadvantage that voices are overlaid by atmospheric disturbances, but also the advantage that any conce ivable influencing of the microphone by those present is excluded. It has bee n proved that voices from the ether can be captured above all atmospheric noise [ 10]. *** There were no noises during Dr. Raudive's studio ex periments. The academic participants did not say a word. The voices of dead friends and relations were recognized. If a supra-or subconscious form of ener gy released the phenomena it would have happened unconsciously, but it makes no difference, for that, too, would be a proof of the conversion of conscious energy in to the energy form of the technical medium's tape! It is estimated that some 100,000 tape recordings o f voices from the other world have been stored away in different parts of the globe. S o there is plenty of evidence. The open question is how to interpret it. The crux is t hat so far it cannot be said with scientific certainty that the transcendental voices really belong to the dead. It is conceivable that the conscious energy of living per sons (including sub-and supra- consciousness) may directly affect electronic appar atus. It may even be enough for someone somewhere who is taking absolutely no part in the experiment to release unconscious energy which is converted into electrom agnetic oscillations which get recorded on the tape. From my point of view it make s little difference whether the voices of the dead or conscious scraps of conversat ion by contemporaries are taken down magnetically. In either case there is proof of conscious energies which produce effects without having caused them consciously. The hunt for voices from the spirit world continues . In May 1974 Dr. Constantin Raudive [11] wrote: For the first time in the history of post-mortem ex amination we have at our disposal an object which exhibits the characteristic of 'rep eatability' which is to be considered a conclusive proof of the existence of this object.

Facts are the true language of science. *** Obviously the virulent discussion of and research i nto forms of consciousness after death are far from exhausted by questioning people who have experienced suspended animation or the hunt for transcendental voices. Hy pnotists use suggestion to send human 'guinea-pigs' not only back to their youth, b ut also way past their intrauterine existence into a life before birth. Thorwald Dethlefsen [12], a young hypnotist from Mu nich, possesses accurate records of séances in which the hypnotized subject is first returned to the age of a babe in arms and later asked about his existence be fore birth. This hypnotic retrospective covers two or three previous births! When asked the 'guinea-pigs' assured him that they had lived before their subjec tive birth under other names, in other places and often with a different sex. They n amed names and birthdays from these previous lives and, although they did not kno w them, spoke in the languages of the countries in which they had lived two or three births ago. And to give the reader cold shivers, on more than one occasion they descri bed their own deaths. That makes research really spooky. Morey Bernstein [13] used hypnosis to send Mrs. Rut h Simmons back to the ages of four, three, two and one years. Bernstein forced Mr s. Simmons to think even further back -before her birth. Suddenly she began to talk under a different name, as Bridey Murphy, from another life in Ireland about the midd le of the nineteenth century. Everything Ruth Simmons said was recorded on tape, transcribed and checked up on the spot in Ireland by linguistic comparisons (Gael ic), examination of church registers and village records. The descriptions of places and people by Ruth Simmons alias Bridey Murphy tallies exactly with the information gleaned on the spot. Naturally the hypnotized guinea-pig Ruth Simmons had never seen t he old records, nor could she have known of them by telepathy, because no one who could have acted as a 'transmittee' had shown any interest in the dust-co vered documents. Did Ruth Simmons experience all the things describe d in her trance in an 'incarnation' in the last century? It seems inadmissible to accep t that, because it would be overstretching our imagination and demanding too mu ch of our realistic way of looking at things. Yet: 'What everyone considers se ttled is what is most worth investigating,' as the physicist George Christoph L ichtenberg (1742-1799) said. It is the old, old story. People who take a great i nterest in the explanation of such phenomena do not waste their time convincing materi alists who find the only metaphysical reality in material things and reject as nonsense everything that cannot be described by their formulae, masses and weights. Incidentally I feel that materialists are the very people who ought to agree with 'my' Trinity of spirit-matter- energy - after all it concerns the centre of their world picture. I want to keep my hobby-horse on a loose rein and not ride it to deat h, especially as it is given unequivocal support by a man like Werner von Braun [14]:"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":" 130 'Science has established that nothing can vanish wi thout a trace. There is no destruction in nature, only transformation.' In contrast to the religious interpretation (the 's oul' is immortal) I consider it very probable in the physical sense that the conscious e nergy of dead people can make itself felt in our four-dimensional world by conver sion into another form of energy. If energies from the 'other world' can make themselves perceptible among us, the reverse path - from the earth to the 'other world' - must also be practicable. Our state of consciousness is bound to the fourth dimension, the unfolding of time, an attachment that is possibly not applicable in the ' other world'. *** The world-famous French clairvoyant Belline, aged 5 0, lost his only son, aged 20, in a car accident in 1969. For twenty months Belline vai nly tried to establish contact with Michel through his telepathic abilities. But sudden ly he sensed an 'invisible nearness', which he described as a 'third ear' or 'light-heari ng'. Belline was afraid he was the victim of an illusion conjured up by his suffering. He began to tape the conversations he had with Michel: in 1973 they appeared in a book [15] with a foreword by Gabriel Marcel of the Institut de France, as well as the op inions of 90 personalities in the world of art and science, about the experiment. The timelessness of the fourth dimension in the oth er world became clear from the records. 8th April 1971, 8 a.m. Belline: Michel, what is it like 'over there'? Michel: It is another world, a dream which cannot b e expressed in words. Movement, transparency, thoughts. Here neither earthly good n or earthly evil exists. It is a kind of homelessness. a kind of dream in countless dimensio ns and vibrations. ... Here, time as you conceive of it at this moment, becomes a car icature. That's all I can say. If it ever becomes possible to direct conscious ene rgies from here to the 'other world', we should be able to ask those who live there for d ata about past and future. The reason: the 'other worlders' exist in a timeless di mension their state does not seem to be shackled to the passage of time. In terms of physics this possibility is quite feasi ble. Variable states of energy - say elementary particles which can transform themselves into each other: a neutron into a proton, an electron into a neutrino - have quite di fferent 'life spans'. Many of them have such short life spans that they really ought n ot to exist. The life of a positron or sigma particle lasts for a trillionth of a second. How can we really conceive of that? A million times a million times a million = a '10' wi th 18 noughts! A neutral pion 'lives' exactly 10 15 (i.e. ten to the minus fifteenth) seconds and the luckless neutrino has no life span at all in a state of rest (rest mass = 0) . But if such a neutrino is accelerated it 'lives' again."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":" 131 In spite of their absurdly minute life spans, eleme ntary particles conceal up to 10 22 electron volts. They shoot out of the universe thro ugh suns and planets, later to transform themselves into myons and neutrinos - in 100/1,000th of a second. Forty years ago physicists were convinced that they had discovered the smallest particle in the atom. Today they know that there is a subatomic world which is tinier than the atomic nucleus and contains much more ener gy than anything that we can so far conceive of as 'nascent energy'. The concept of time breaks down in this miraculous world. Physicists no longer know where or how they should classify the electron, tha t building stone and atomic envelope. With mathematically proven particles whic h travel faster than light - say, the tachyons, tradyons and luxyons calculated by Ge rald Feinberg - all concepts of time collapse definitively. They behave in exactly the opposite way to our 'normal' elementary particles. Instead of exhibiting infinite mass and with it inf inite energy when they reach the speed of light - as Einstein reckoned they would — these particles lose mass and energy the faster they travel. What is really incon ceivable is that the speed of light is the lowest limit of their velocity - above it they can reach a trillionfold the speed of light. If our concepts of time have already become hazy owing to the prospect of interstellar space travel, they fall into a state o f total confusion when they tackle particles that move faster than light. Every normal person is convinced - and justifiably so until now - that before an effect ex ists there must be a cause. But here everything is upside down. With particles travellin g faster than light, the effect can come first and the cause later. Something is going on, but we do not really know what. Thus, just as physicists in general recognize the e xistence of antimatter, (*) we can also postulate in the distant future an 'antitime' in which a 'counter-time' unfolds opposite to all 'Normal time'. Then there would be - how can I make it intelligible? - no past, present or future. Memories of the future are taking place now, today, at this very moment! The concept of time becomes the subjec tive unfolding of states of consciousness. If we can still speak of consciousne ss in such a context. ... In so far as the conscious energy of the dead exist s outside all ties of time, and terrestrial conscious energy can make contact with it, the mystery of prophesy would be solved. What is still hypothesis could in future not only be proved by the conclusions of technical research, but also realize d in practice. Hypotheses in the sense of 'accepted suppositions' are the prerequisi tes for all development. We only need a little courage to bring them into the conver sation. I've got that courage. ---- [*] Matter from atoms which consist exclusively of antiparticles. incapable of existence in the presence of normal matter. ---- Let us assume that for one reason or another an oth erworldly consciousness is interested in influencing the behaviour of one or s everal people or a group (peoples,"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":" 132 countries, religions, kingdoms). It leaves its time less state, and makes contact with a terrestrial consciousness. The reverse process is a lso conceivable. The conscious energy of an earthly person (who else could it be b ut a prophet?) could in specific situations communicate with the timeless conscious energy of someone from the other world. From the dead colleague and his intact consc ious energy (don't give me that old stuff about the 'soul'!) it could learn what is going to happen in the future. From historical experience the person knows that the eve nt communicated by energy cannot have taken place yet, and therefore is announced (' prophesied') for the future. The paradox is that the event prophesied can never be held up or prevented. No visionary saint is that holy. A man dies. His consciousness (in the form of energ y) reaches a 'timeless state'. In this version he 'sees' his home town swallowed up b y the floods. As this event has not happened in his lifetime, it must take place in the future. A consciousness that becomes timeless after death cannot know when the f uture has laid down the deadline for the catastrophe. Otherworldly consciousnesses ( in spite of their energies) still have links with living children, relatives and friends. They strive to win influence over the conscious energies of the people on the old earth w ith whom they have ties, for they want to warn them of the catastrophe which is pendi ng at some unknown time in the future. The inhabitants of the earth, tied to the daily rou nd, have not trained the cerebral functions that could perceive such phenomena - the impulses radiated from the other world by the conversion of energy (the energy princ iple) do not reach them. The other-worlders have to make their impact through a medium (who has trained the faculties that are capable of reception). In a tran ce (the state which develops paranormal faculties) the medium 'sees', by the act ion of conscious energy, a town swallowed up by the floods, but he does not know wh en it will happen - this is plausible for other-worlders themselves do not know it in their timeless state. So if a medium (prophet, priest, seer) preaches: 'Pray! Pra y fervently, otherwise your town will be swallowed up by floods!' it may be a plausi ble summons, but its contents are a lie, for the town will disappear at some time or ot her in any case. If it were not so, the timeless other-worlders would not have been able to announce the catastrophe. *** Let us consider a different case. By energy convers ion a terrestrial prophet sends his (trained) mental antennae into the other world. He 'sees' events that can only occur in the future, because they have not happened in past history (as known or experienced by the prophet). In other words, the mediumistic vi sionary does not learn what day is to be ticked off in red on the calendar. He has onl y one chance of giving a more precise 'message', namely if he has 'seen' the even t in such detail that he can work out the approximate deadline for it. But there is one t hing that even the cleverest and best trained prophet cannot do: prevent the event he has 'seen'! If it were not programmed for the indefinable future, an otherworldly conscio us energy could not have transmitted it and a terrestrial energy could not h ave 'seen' it. It would be old hat if events which have been in the history books for yea rs were communicated."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":" 133 Does not this physical and metaphysical hypothesis explain quite plausibly why messages received in 'visions' proclaim and warn of coming events, but can never prevent them? Does not that also clarify why prophe tic and visionary messages are often so obscure, 'mysterious' and ambiguous? With their present conscious energy, seers and prophets do perceive future events, but t hey cannot 'evaluate' them - except in the form of obscure predictions and unverifiable prophecies. The last book in the New Testament is The Revelatio n of St. John the Divine. It is the book of a visionary. The prophet sees images of env ironmental pollution, aircraft, helicopters, nuclear explosions, etc. He uses his o wn words to reproduce these visions as he received them in communications from consciou s energies: ... and there followed hail and fire mingled with b lood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, an d all green grass was burnt up ... and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was c ast into the sea ... and the third part of the waters became wormwood (radioactive?) ... an d the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed ... (Chap. 8). And they (the locusts) had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle .... And they had tails like scorpions, and there were sting s in their tails .... And ... I saw the horses ... and them that sat on them, having breast plates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone; and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone ...' (Ch ap. 9). Is it not crystal clear why John wrote his very acc urate descriptions in his own words using his world of ideas? He did not know our moder n technical vocabulary. It is stimulating to learn that the atomic physicist Bern hard Philberth [16] has written a modern interpretation of revelation. The only distu rbing thing about his technological exegesis is that he always appeals to God in a high ly personal fashion for all the prophetic-cum-apocalyptic explanations. That brushe s me up the wrong way. I just don't like it when people offer God, the last and h ighest instance of being, as an explanation for everything, when the goal can also be reached using reason. *** It is much the same with the explanation of somnamb ulist phenomena: the time when they were interpreted plays an important part. The poet Justinus Kerner (1786-1862) was the centre of the Swabian School of Poets. Many of his poems figured in school-books for gener ations, many of them achieved the popularity of folk songs. Justinus Kerner, a do ctor, devoted himself to a special field of research, the supernatural. He kept a diar y of his observations with scientific precision. For many years his special subject was F riederike Hauffe, the wife of a tradesman. He recorded her somnambulist phenomena i n the two-volumed work Die Seherin von Prevorst. I possess the first edition o f 1829, and so do not have to refer to extracts from Kerner's work in scientific publicati ons, which often quote him."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":" 134 Friederike Hauffe came from the village of Prevorst near the Wurttemberg town of Lowenstein, in a mountainous district, whose inhabi tants, says Kerner, were open to sidereal and magnetic influences. Father Hauffe was a gamekeeper. Friederike was brought up 'simply and naturally'. Never spoiled, s he grew up to be a 'blooming, vivacious' child. Whereas her brothers and sisters were bothered by apparitions this peculiarity was not found in Friederike, but she di d develop a power of foretelling the future that was announced to her in dreams. She bec ame the 'wife of a tradesman', had children and led a bourgeois existence, but her emo tional life became so intense that 'she heard and felt everything over the greatest di stances'. She could no longer bear the light. Once when an ecclesiastical relative ope ned the window shutters at midday, she fell into a cramp that lasted for three days. About this time, she felt that a spirit only visibl e to her magnetized her at seven o'clock every evening for seven days in succession. It happened with three fingers which the spirit spread out like rays. (Presumably preparation by and first traces of othe rworldly conscious energies.) Put into a deep sleep by this spiritual magnetism, she stated that 'she could only be kept alive through magnetization'. In this state, K erner relates, she saw behind every person who came near her another person, 'also with a human figure, but floating as in ecstasy'. (A phenomenon that many visionaries descr ibe in the same way.) 'I must confess,' writes the doctor, 'that at the t ime I still shared the views of the world and their lies about her, so that I advised her not to pay any attention to her long lasting sleep-waking state.' On 25th November, 1826 , Kerner took Mrs. Hauffe into his house 'completely wasted away ... and incapable of lying down'. He told her that he did not take any notice of what she said in her sleep, and that the somnambulistic state which had lasted so long to the despair of he r relatives must finally come to a stop."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":" 135 At Mama Rosas San Damiano 'Mama Rosa is obviously successful in her work The south wall of the farm is covered with votive tablets saying 'Mary has helped' The me ssages of thanks are written in all"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":" 136 languages known to me Even without the Church's off icial blessing, Mama Rosa seems to be on good terms with miracles.

After many weeks of medical and psychic treatment K erner asked her while she was in deep sleep whether she felt 'that a repeated and controlled magnetic treatment could still save her. She replied she could not give an answer to that until she had rece ived seven magnetic strokes at seven o'clock the next evening .... (Had another wo rldly conscious energy notified her?) .... The seven magnetic strokes she received had the result that the next morning to her great surprise, for she herself did not know how it happened, she could sit up easily in bed and felt far stronger than after all the remedies tried hitherto.' Kerner introduced a regular magnetic treatment (*) by strokes from the temples down to the epigastrium. Mrs. H was in such a deep somnambulistic life owing to my magnetic treatment that she was never in the waking state even when she see med to be so. Admittedly she was more awake than other men, for it is strange not to call this state, which is actually the most vivid wakefulness, awake, but she was in the s tate of inwardness. There are no dates in the relevant literature about the visionary's inner state. Friederike Hauffe put on record: It often seems to me as if I am outside myself, I f loat above my body and then I also think above my body. But it is by no means an unple asant feeling because I am still conscious of my body. If only my soul was more clos ely attached to the 'nerve spirit' (!), then it would also bind itself closer to the n erves, but the bones of my nerve spirit becomes looser and looser.

I know of no earlier medical-cum-scientific documen tation of a 'case' like the one Dr. Justinus Kerner described in the two volumes which are now nearly 150 years old. As doctor and scientist he first examined the phenomen a of Friederike Hauffe as a clinical picture of illness: he went into her child hood and origins, living conditions and habits. He wanted to get to the heart of the ma tter. The final conclusion he came to after all these efforts was that the state of ma gnetic sleep released special visionary abilities. He examined every case of precognition, which to him verged on the miraculous, with an accuracy and persistence that w ould do credit to' Scotland Yard. Out of dozens of examples I shall describe one of t he cases Kerner recorded: On 25th November, 1826, Friederike Hauffe entered K erner's house in Weinsperg. She did not know the town and had no acquaintances there. The house was on the same level as and not far from the Law Courts. A ce rtain K, who had died in the house some years previously, had managed the affair s of a Mr. F very badly, so that the 'business had gone bankrupt'. Mrs. Hauffe said, in a magnetic sleep: That man F is there again, disturbing me ... what i s he showing me? A page, not quite as long as a folio, covered with figures. The upper right-hand corner is folded slightly, in the left-hand corner there is a figure ....This page lies underneath a lot of documents; no one takes any notice of it. He wants me to tell my doctor and through him to issue a warning .... This page lies in a building that st ands sixty paces from my bed. In it is a large, then a small, room. In the latter a tall m an sits working at a table. He goes out and now he is returning. Beyond this room there is an even larger one with longish chests in it. I see a cupboard that stands at the e ntrance and its door is somewhat open. ... Above on the table there is something mad e of wood ... and on it lie papers; I see them lying in three piles .... In the right-han d pile there is nothing of this man's, but in the other two I feel from him, to be precise in the centre one, a little below half- way down, that page which torments him so. Kerner recognized the high court from the building she described, but took her vision for a dream image. Mostly to pacify his patient, fo r she was constantly plagued by the"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":" 141 story, he went to the judge, who was staggered beca use at the moment described he had actually gone into another room and then return ed to his place. The apparition returned; the data became more and m ore precise. Kerner and the judge examined the 'pile of files' which Mrs. Hauff e had described so vividly. They got the sort of surprise a police inspector would n ot hope for in his wildest dreams. 'We found in an envelope a page just as the visiona ry had described it with figures and words in the hand of that man ... (whom Mrs. Ha uffe had 'seen'). ... This page contained a proof, the only one, that K had kept a secret book, which was not found after his death, in which he had apparently entered a great deal that never came to light....' In a sleep-waking state Friederike Hauffe dictated a letter to the dead man F's wife telling her she was innocent and could face the ban kruptcy confidently. The judge prepared a conclusive official statement of the who le business. Frau Hauffe seemed to be revivified after the long drawn out affair. On 5th August, 1829, the visionary of Prevorst died in exactly the way she had predicted in a magnetic sleep on 2 May. How could that outstanding doctor Justinus Kerner s ense or know about the conclusions of modern psi research 150 years ago? W hat could he know about the conversion of energy/time? For what else appeared t o the visionary but the conscious energy of the dead Mr. F, who wanted to help his wi fe in her imminent bankruptcy? Who else besides Mr. F knew about the bundle of fil es and the letter which played a decisive part in the proceedings? The case described by Kerner is more than clairvoya nce: it is exact knowledge of an event. We can understand why Kerner's account still keeps on appearing in modern scientific literature. It established standards for carrying out experiments and evaluating results. The visionary's message that sh e received all her impressions and visions from a 'nerve spirit' runs like a leitmotiv through all the accounts. I should like to posit boldly that Kerner supplied the first 'pro of of my theory that conscious energies seek the media appropriate to them - and f ind them! *** Mankind cannot complain about a shortage of prophet s and their frightening communications. We must have hindsight to understan d why the prophecies which every now and then have exploded like thunder in hi story always announced disaster. For why should otherworldly conscious energies make contact with terrestrial ones simply to spread happiness and joy? 'Children, it's a wonderful age! Rejoice! Taxes are going to be reduced! In twenty years' time you will still own what you do today! Love each other, for no shadow will fall on your li ves! Disarm, there will never be any more idiotic wars!' The energetic news apparatu s would hardly be set in motion for cheerful messages like that. The 'spirits above' still exclusively transmit, as they have always done, descriptions of imminent catastrophes, world destruction, misery an d famine. A wretched job for a messenger, but who warns anyone about happiness?"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":" 142 What does even a brief glance at the annals of visi onaries 'reveal'? The itinerant Greek priest Peregrinus Proteus at fi rst preached the doctrine of Christianity; then he had doubts and changed his ph ilosophy. He became a cynic, one of those philosophers who cultivated the ideal of f rugality to the point of folly. The convert was not happy. He 'saw' - and as a preacher naturally told everybody - that mankind was on 'the brink of annihilation'. As he d id not want to take part in this mass disaster, he logically burnt himself to death during the Olympic games in 165. The Phrygian prophet Montanus (156) belonged to an early Christian sect which aroused among people a brief-lived hope of the immi nent return of Jesus. In order to be well prepared, the prophet exhorted his follower s to practise rigorous asceticism, for otherwise 'the end of the world was at hand'. In 140 the Roman apostolic father Hermas in his boo k 'The Shepherd' (which formed part of the New Testament for a time) called on Chr istians to do penance as the ultimate salvation 'from the imminent Last Judgment '. Over 400 years ago (1568) the Provencal plague doct or Michael Nostradamus (1503- 1566) posthumously published his book Les Prophetie s [17]. His prophecies, extending down to modern times, which in the opinio n of scholars tally with recorded facts, consist of a non-stop list of wars, pestilen ces and disasters. The fact that most of the events are supposed to have taken place accordi ng to plan is small con solation. If we made ourselves a present of a collected volum e of prophecies it would be as thick as a New York telephone directory, and poring over disasters is no fun - especially if we've got them at home!

After all you'v e never said anything against Christianity. And I never will say anything against Christianity. I have actually had visions of Jesus, but they are not comparable with the state of proph ecy. I have just read in the papers that you are convinc ed of the existence of U.F.O.s. Can you tell me something about that? I can tell you that there's nothing new in my life. I've known about U.F.O.s for many years. People ask me when I first knew anything abo ut them. That's a question I can't answer; as I've known about U.F.O.s since I could w alk. Have you ever thought about why and when you consciously knew you could walk? So U.F.O.s actually exist, in your opinion. Where d o these objects come from? We shall soon find out that they come from an undis covered planet in our solar system. We shall make official contact with the cre ws and learn from them how existing sources of energy can be better and more s imply exploited. The conditions of gravity in our solar system have been calculated. So there is no room for an unknown planet. Besides, space probes h ave traversed the space 'behind the sun' and no new planet has been recorded. That makes no difference. We shall soon discover an unknown planet which is in the vicinity of Jupiter. Jupiter is very far from our sun. That giant planet no longer forms part of the life zone of our solar system. How intelligence supposed to o riginate in such intense cold? Just wait and see! By the way, U.F.O.s are piloted by women. How do we know that? I can feel the vibrations and they're feminine.

At this point Jeane Dixon forbade further tape-reco rdings for two hours and also prohibited publication of that part of the conversa tion. Our talk ended as follows: Do you ever drink alcohol?

Make sure that you report this interview properly! If you misrepresent the things we have just spent such a long time discussing I'll never give another interview again. 'Something' vibrates from our levels of energy, 'so mething' sees images of future events, 'something' vibrates in our brains from ali en otherworldly levels of energy and produces visions. Does that mean that everything th at Jeane Dixon and others prophesied came true? Of course not, but who would be surprised? If you r ealize that the world beyond the (hitherto) physically conceivable is 'timeless', ra diated energies could naturally be picked up by 'receivers', but could scarcely or onl y with difficulty be given a date in time - lucky bull's eyes! The forms of consciousness of otherworlders who see k to make contact with us are either emotional or a logical (because they are out side the terrestrial experience and laws of time) or both. Otherwise they would not war n against ostensible coming events, which have already happened in the 'timeles s state', for there would be nothing they could do to change them. Or: Forms of consciousness of people in this world pene trate into the 'other world' and hope to be able to avert a 'seen' event. But that w ould be a one-sided attempt at communication by terrestrial beings. In that case t he otherworlders would have no connection with warnings of imminent future disaste rs. I much prefer the second assumption; it would obvia te the need to involve people from the other world. For then conscious energies p roduced by our brains would be capable at certain intervals of time of communicati ng with the 'time-reversed' world (tachyons!) and tap otherworldly consciousnesses fo r prophecies. *** I extracted a lot of information from Mythology whe n working on my theory about visits to our globe by extraterrestrial beings. I w as fascinated by the knowledge of the old chroniclers, because it handed down to mankind factual information the"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":" 146 importance and scope of which the writers did not a ppreciate in their own days. As far as contacts between the other world and this one ar e concerned, mythology is an equally valuable source of information. Here are so me examples. The Indo-Germanic Celts were driven across the Rhin e by the Germans and later occupied the British Isles. These insular Celts of the first post-Christian centuries were on familiar terms with fairies, beautiful, mag ic-working, daemonic beings, nature spirits, who constantly went back and forth between the natural and the supernatural world. They astonished the island Celt s by their knowledge of the future and when they visited the earth they inspired great respect because they enticed chosen vessels into their 'kingdom' and then let th em return to earth again. The North Germans were firmly convinced of the exis tence of a 'second I', which they called Fylgja. It accompanied people like an invisi ble shadow. Fylgja belonged to the personal consciousness, but could also become free from it and appear elsewhere. The Scandinavians looked on Fylgja as a familiar guardi an spirit, who, when needed, but especially when danger threatened, could speed into the other world and return with a wealth of information to help earth-dwellers out of their trouble. The Druids, the ancient pagan priests of the Celts, would only recognize as their prophet the man who could produce the Druid's cauld ron, an exquisite and miraculous vessel, which was made out of the 'spirit of the ot her world'. Not even Uri Geller could cook up all the prophecies the Druidic seers brewed in their cauldrons. In the phantom-ridden night of the Samhuin (a pheno menon from the ancient Indian Vedas), even the boundaries between this world and the next are supposed to have fallen. Spooky figures of all kinds are supposed to have materialized from the void. The 'astral body' plays a great part in the occult literature of all ages. This remarkable phenomenon is supposed to be a 'delicate envelope' for the body and soul. The gnostic religion, which makes man's salvation dependent on his knowledge of the secrets of the world, asserts that the astral body penetrates the human body and forms something like a connecting link between the earthly and the 'higher' body. One cannot mention astral bodies without mentioning auras. Aura means air or breath in Greek. Not only has it been a topic of conversat ion since ancient times, but it is reputed to have existed always. And precisely today this generally invisible envelope which surrounds human beings is the subject of para -psychological research. (Indeed we say that such-and-such a poet, scholar and even politician has a 'certain aura' in the sense of charisma!) I do not intend to quote all the periods in which t he undefined aura is supposed to have been definitively discovered. But as a proof t hat serious scholars were interested in this problem, I must mention the scientist and c hemist Carl-Ludwig Freiherr von Reichenbach (1788-1869), who discovered paraffin-wa x and creosote in wood-tar. Reichenbach was convinced of the existence of this invisible original force (which could be made visible), which he called 'Od force' (from the Germanic 'od' = original) - so convinced that he devoted two whole decades of his working life to its discovery. Like Franz Anton Mesmer, Reichenbach believed that the Od force could be"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":" 147 transferred from one person to another. Yet this re markable phenomenon, astral body, aura or Od force, was first confirmed technically b y chance in our own day. In the second half of the forties, the Russian engi neer Semyonov Davidovich Kirlian from Krasnodar on the Kuban noticed that discharges appeared between the body of a patient and the electrodes in the high frequency ra nge of an apparatus for electrotherapeutic treatment. Kirlian was keen to k now whether this state, which was visible to the eye, could also be photographed. He and his wife Valentina undertook the difficult job of developing these photographs. Kirlian photography, which is used everywhere today , exhibits the so-called Kirlian effect. In high frequency alternating current field s which are harmless to man, animals and plants, bodies acquire a luminescence that can be photographed, but are not caused by high temperature. It is also known as 'co ld luminescence'. As a passing example of the phenomenon which Kirlia n photography can make visible, I should mention photos that show a fresh flower with many blossoms and the same flower with some blossoms cut off. In the plac e where the blossoms were their outline still showed up in a photograph taken secon ds after the cut was made and they were no longer there. Countless exposures have been taken all over the world using the Kirlian effect. They show radiations around men 's bodies that are not visible to the naked eye. For example, there is a photo taken after a hand wa s amputated: the outlines of the amputated hand appear on the photographic plate. An d most remarkable of all, a man lay down on a sofa, then stood up and went away, an d a photo taken of the sofa just afterwards shows the outline of the man lying there ! Here an unknown force obviously causes a physical phenomenon. When the te chnique is developed further, mankind will have a brand new principle, for at the moment the photographed aura - or whatever it is - varies considerably in quality, i.e. clarity. I am always shaken to observe how almost daily unin telligible passages from myths and holy scriptures turn out to be realities. Peopl e used to talk about the aura that surrounded certain people - and it exists! It can b e photographed. The way in which the Kirlian effect works has been explained in prin ciple. It is not denied by physicists that every body 'radiates' to a greater or lesser d egree. Kirlian discovered how to photograph the radiations. But how do we answer the 'phenomenal' question of how a no-longer existent object (cut blossom, amputated h and, man who has left the room) continues to radiate for a brief period, i.e. can s till be 'active' in its former position? When all is said and done scholars claim that the b odies are the cause of the radiations. Could it possibly be the other way round? Whither w as the energy radiated? In the physical sense every radiation is 'material' . This applies to light radiation (quanta) and all kinds of corpuscle radiations (par ticle radiations). Radiation energy disintegrates. Disintegrates into what? According t o the energy principle nothing can vanish into the VOID. That is the point at which ev en nuclear physics is baffled. It is impossible to prove the existence of certain atomic particles after their conversion into energy.

Vassilev, Professor of Psychology at Leningrad University, holder of the Order of Lenin, trying to resign? or was he expressing a hope when he said: The discovery of ESP (*) energy will be just as imp ortant as the discovery of atomic energy.' *** This apparent detour via para-psychological phenome na to get to apparitions is not a detour. Visions and apparitions are para-psychologi cal phenomena. There is energy behind every vision. Where does it come from? What causes several milliard atoms to make themselves visible at a specified time in a sp ecified place and demonstrate intelligent behaviour by this action? Why are visio ns always perceived only by a few people? Why do hundreds and thousands of people who are present notice nothing? Why do visions appear to the visionaries for prefer ence at the same place? Are they incapable of changing the venue, once it is establi shed? The visionary is always asked to be at a prescribed place on a certain day at a c ertain time. Are ('divine') visions incapable of appearing exactly where and when it su its them? It can be proved from the small selection of vision s I have described that in several cases the visionaries did not 'see' the complete ap parition spontaneously or suddenly: if anything they were confronted with a 'hazy indef inable greyish-white mass'. They only perceived the visionary image in this 'mass' a fter an intensive effort (autosuggestion!). The Heroldsbacher girls 'saw' on ly a 'white gleam' during the vision of 12th October, 1949 - not until later did it assu me the form of 'a white lady', and then it was visible only to the boys. Mama Rosa of San Damiano also said that at first she saw only a 'hazy figure' which later 'solidifie d' into the Mother of God. (Let me remind you of the Jesuit Athanasius Kircher who con sidered 'mists and vapours' helpful when water-divining in likely spots.) The official records of the visions seen by the chi ldren at Fatima entitle us to conclude that physical events were concerned. The visions al ways announced themselves with 'lightning', whose electric discharges were accompa nied by roaring and cracking noises. The little Lucia said that whenever a visio n disappeared she heard a noise as if a 'firework rocket had exploded in the distance'. ---- [*] ESP = Extrasensory Perception ---- When the Fatima children had their fifth vision on 13th September, 1917, several thousand spectators clearly saw a ball of light flo ating slowly and majestically"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":" 149 heavenwards. On 13th May, 1924 pilgrims observed a 'strange white cloud' above the oak tree where the visions always appeared. They sa id that objects like snowflakes fell from it that dissolved into nothing just above ground-level. Lucia wrote later that the vision of the Blessed Virgin had always approac hed slowly in 'the reflection of a light', and that the children had always seen the M adonna for the first time when the point of light stopped still above the oak. When Lu cia was asked at the official inquiry why she frequently lowered her eyes during the visi ons, instead of looking the Blessed Virgin straight in the face, she answered: 'Because she often blinded me [19].' In the case of Lourdes the idea of the materializat ion of an alien form of energy is literally served up on a silver platter! In the fir st as yet unembellished accounts, Bernadette Soubirous explained that originally she had seen only something indefinite ... something 'like a fluttering white c loth or a flour-sack [20]'; in addition she had heard a muffled noise 'like a gust of wind' in front of the grotto. (Record 'by Doctors Lacrampe, Balencia and Peyrus, dated 27.3.1 858.) Bernadette also gave these details to other personalities [21]. *** Three possibilities occur to me: 1. A vision does not appear suddenly; it must first arrange its atoms into a visible 'image'. (The frequent occurrence of the word 'sudd enly' in the records is explained by the indifference of the visionary's examiners to th e 'preliminary play' [haze, veil, white cloths, etc.]. By insistent questioning they push forward to the goal, the description of the vision. That is how visions 'sud denly' come into being - at least in the official records!) 2. An electromagnetic, probably highly ionized, fie ld comes into being during the appearance of the vision. Air is compressed very ra pidly. This causes sound vibrations of varying volume and strength like a 'dull roaring wind'. Air is sucked out of the grotto as if through an exhaust and compressed. 3. If the apparition collapses, air rushes into the vacuum which is burst open by the spontaneously dissolving magnetic field. That is wh y even passive, spectators hear a 'bang' at many visionary shrines. Even this brief resume allows us to conclude that p hysical laws lie at the root of the unknown causes of visions. Would Almighty God, if h e were informed of these phenomena by trusty messengers, simply bow down to these lapidary laws? The psychiatrist's couch is the place for explainin g and curing accounts of ostensible visions feigned by charlatans, would-be visionaries and religious cranks, or cooked up in the brains of hysterics ripe for the asylum. The causes of visionary phenomena that we can take seriously must lie outside human reason and the functions of the human brain. Ionized air, loud bangs, ball lightning etc. , offer such hard fact that you can break your teeth on them. Who is the great Manitu, the mighty 'spirit' who gaily produces the phenomena?

When the visionaries were followed to the scene of their visions by other people, they were not exclusively a flock of dyed-in-the-wool religious bigots. They often included sceptical sci entists, generally critical journalists and always a number of unbelievers who had not been inoculated with the religious virus. But it is always the devout, the undisputed faithfu l, who insinuate themselves into the mass suggestion of 'holy events' - in a way describ ed by Jacques Hochmann [22], psychiatrist and psychologist at the University Cli nic in Lyons, France, in connection with the psychodrama performance: There is the theoretical model of a 'sociometry' at the centre of which is the social atom. This atom is to be understood as the nucleus which is formed by the attracting and repelling relations in an individual environmen t. These relations consist of a network of interrelational (*) chains, which are ar oused by affective currents. But a homogeneous society of 'social atoms' is only formed at places of pilgrimage such as Lourdes, where the pilgrims are definitely bound to each other by 'affective currents'. ---- [*] From relationalism. The doctrine that relations have an objective existence. ---- It does not exist at places where curiosity and the human mass hope for miracles are thrown together. Apparitions announce themselves to 'visionaries' wh en the latter are in a state of hypnotic compulsion and what I can only call helple ssness. The apparition always safeguards itself by specifying time and place. 'I want you to come here on the 13th of next month, ' the vision ordered the three Fatima children. And the Madonna appeared punctuall y at the promised spot. On 13th July, 1917, 2.30 p.m. was exactly astronomic noon f or the geographical position of Fatima. (Why?) Again the beautiful lady summoned th e children to a meeting on the 13th of the following month at the same place. The flow of information from the vision (transmitter) to the visionaries (receivers) had been set in motion. So far, so good. But why are visions tied to time a nd place? I can only suggest a fantastic possibility which admittedly does not fit very well with the so-called known facts. But I think it is better to put forward a th eory than to lurk in the underground like a coward. In doing so I am quite conscious of the warning that the historian Egon Friedell (1878-1938) wrote in the albums of all tho se who were too bold: These are the real miracles.

Astrophysicists know that solar systems incomparabl y older than ours exist and therefore presumably much older intelligent beings, too. The earliest intelligences began to ask questions in order to extend their kno wledge. Before these intelligent extraterrestrial beings planned space travel, they engaged in astro-physical and astronomical research (as our own experts did befor e they sent the first rockets into the atmosphere).

What am I to do, says Zeus? was the question Friedrich Schiller asked in his poem 'Dividing the Earth'. What are we to do ? was also the question the extraterrestrial beings asked themselves. How were they to realize the goal of their expedition, namely increasing their knowledge, if m illennia would have passed when they returned from their journey into space? If the re was no one left alive at home who could evaluate and benefit from the fruits of t heir voyage? Time and space could only be conquered, said the ex traterrestrial academics, if they arranged for descendants at various times in as man y places in the cosmos as possible -naturally 'in their own image'! So the astronauts were trained and given the mission during the long journey to make for all the planets apparently similar to their home planet and land on them. Having thoroughly explored a planet they had to separate the most advanced form of life and make it intelligent by a deliberate artificial mutation. (*) After what pattern? Obviously 'in their own ima ge'. Thus time was overcome by a fairly simple trick.

So if the earth had bee n visited by extraterrestrial beings say three million years ago, accounts of the event could not have been incorporated into mythology as I claimed in my books. The extrat errestrial beings could not a) have known that our planet was a worthwhile goal, nor b) that hominids had just achieved intelligence on their evolutionary path. Homo Sapiens only became intelligent after the visi t by extraterrestrial beings. If the earth was visited three million years ago, then int elligence has existed exactly since that visit. And if we were first to be visited five hundred thousand years in the future, the point now would first exist then. The temporal assumptions are unreal. Whenever the point Now is fixed, it is in any case identical with the visit of extraterrestrial beings to our planet regardless of where NOW is set in the line of time. We need a great deal more than is available in our present-day state of technology to practise interstellar space travel.

It has long been common knowledge that only 1/10 of our brain is active. What does the dominating remainder of 9/10 do, the remainder which we could have at our disposal? Why did natural selection, evolution and mutation produce a brain with a weight of 1,300 to 1,800 grammes if mankind scarcel y uses it? Furthermore, the 'beast brain' is capable of incalculably more than is dema nded of it in everyday life. Mediums, clairvoyants, telepathists, telekinetists ... and prophets prove it. When they 'grafted' their own genetic characteristi cs on to hominids - a method adopted on a minor scale in plant cultivation and t he breeding of domestic animals - the extraterrestrial cosmonauts also transferred th eir highly developed faculties of extrasensory perception - in 'their own image'.

But how were the communications to be established? Electromagnet ic waves diverge at great distances, because of the resultant inevitable inte rference, but there are no obstacles to thought transference. Present-day researchers have proved this clearly in telepathic experiments when they have sent thought waves from transmitting mediums to receivers through several hundred metres of sea. Re searchers have also shut up receivers in Faradaic cages protected against all k inds of waves by lead plates. The telepathic signals came through unobstructed. Nevertheless language was an insuperable obstacle t o telepathic news transfers of this kind. The bright cosmonaut mutation specialists had foreseen the development of different languages. Made exactly after their patte rn, in 'their image', they knew that the new race with its various species would have en emies and wage wars. So the development of different languages as a kind of sec ret code in the nascent family of races was unavoidable - as a safeguard against thei r enemies. But different moral and ethical concepts would also take shape along with d ifferent languages, and scientific and technical knowledge would be expressed in diffe rent ways. The news radiated by transmitter X would not be understood by receiver Y because of the language barrier. The only way left was that of emotional and visual telepathy! Feelings such as love, trust, hate, danger etc. would be understood everyw here, just as pictures would be understood by common-sense. In fact every genuine vision begins with the receip t of soothing news. 'Peace be with you.' 'Do not be afraid.' Such emotional telepathy is possible and effective between intelligent beings. Words like 'love' and 'peace' w ere not transmitted in any one language: they would not have been universally unde rstood. (Esperanto, which aspires to be a universal language remains in the ghetto of the language laboratory.) So feelings of love and peace were sent out. The emoti onal transmission was strengthened and consolidated by pictures and symbo ls. Pictures are international and intercosmic. The Mona Lisa's smile gives pleasure i n both Paris and Tokyo. Music was used as a third frequency. Vibrations and shock harmonies that clash with one another excite the neurons of the brain and rel ease oscillations, conversions of energy.

Did it not penetrate in to the layers of consciousness in which a common feeling is programmed? In spite of the existing gaps in the chain of evide nce, I take it as accepted fact that the human brain can register finer and more sensitive o scillations than the most delicate apparatus. No measuring apparatus has ever recorded 'love'. But since brilliant scientists have also been smitten by it, they canno t deny that love exists. The conversion of elements is fully accepted in physics and chemistry. Are other principles meant to be valid for the human brain? Professor George Ungar [24] of Baylor Medicine Coll ege, Houston, Texas, has proved by thousands of animal experiments that brai n cells are activated by electrical impulses and form a new matter — memory molecules. He says: 'whether we like it or not, we must take as our starting point today th e fact that in the long run our brain is a storehouse for millions of memory molecules an d also an apparatus for \"playing\" them'. Thought molecules in the brain are circuits by whic h programmed knowledge can be summoned up. They are material. Once made to oscill ate, they influence the micro- parts of the antimaterial world. Emotions cause the same effect in the brain, as the physicist achieves in his syncroton (accelerator fo r imparting high energies to elementary particles) by electron volts. Each of us carries such energy converters inside him in the form of hate, love, joy, sadness, sympathy, envy. In the normal states emotions release normal reactions. The tranc e, a state reached by suggestive or hypnotic means, raises paranormal faculties to a hi gher power. That much is proved, even if the forces that bring it about have not yet been confirmed. The English physicist and chemist, Sir William Croo kes, who was already well known, experimented in his laboratory with the medi um Daniel Douglas Home. Sir William believed that there was a force which made contact with the body by unknown means. During the experiments the medium D. D. Home - lifted by invisible forces - rose several feet above the ground. Sir Wi lliam wrote: This fantastic event ... did not take place once or twice in bad light, but was repeated hundreds of times in every conceivable condition .. .. Once Home even floated out of one window at a height of 70 feet and floated in th rough another. Such distinguished gentlemen as Lord Dunravei Lord Lindsay and Captain Wynne, who were eye- witnesses were prepared to confirm this fact on oat h [25]. A similar event took place in 1938 before 300 spect ators with the English medium Colin Evans as protagonist. This levitation (*) was photographed at various stages. People have speculated and will continue to specula te about the nature of the forces which cause these phenomena. I should not like to p ut any chips down on a roulette wheel which spurts out this kind of energy: there a re too many possibilities and too few chances of winning. Isn't it enough to know tha t the forces are there and can be recorded and proved? The mere fact of their existen ce is quite enough to give us a good idea why figures in visions float in the air a nd seem to be weightless.

Such open questions should be in cluded in present-day research programmes. Let us stick to the premises. Extraterrestrial bein gs visited other solar systems, too, and left behind scions in their image on suitable p lanets. Some groups of their descendants have an advantage over us. They tamed, developed and trained the 'beast brain' earlier than we did. (As they were visited b y the alien astronauts before us in time, they could have an advantage over us of sever al millennia, owing to time displacement.) ---- [*] The floating of the human body in the air, attr ibuted solely to saints, fakirs and mediums. In psychokinesis the levitation of objects is also known. ---- These ultra mature intelligences are transmitting e nergetic thought impulses intended to stimulate and extend consciousness in us their b rothers and sisters of the same origin. I am firmly convinced that this also explai ns the failure of all temporal and ecclesiastical dictators to restrict human consciou sness and direct it in one particular direction for any length of time. I am prepared for the question: why did the super-i ntelligent extraterrestrials leave no apparatus with which they could establish communica tions with those left behind simply by pressing a button? Well, astronauts do not normally take heavy apparat us with them on long journeys, unless they are necessary for the navigation, steer ing etc. of the spaceship. But in this case, they would have to cram in hundreds of transm itting and receiving sets, because they were playing a game of creating intelligence a t many many places in the cosmos. With all their technical abilities, they obviously did not consider us as their exclusive masterpiece, the unique crown of their creation. The next question, then, is why did they not build communication centres themselves? But the 'second' in the world process at which they made us intelligent 'in their image' by mutation, found us hominids unprepared. A vast t echnological infrastructure would have been needed for such a complicated undertaking as the building of interstellar communication centres - factories that could print integrated circuits and produce chemical semi-conductors, etc. None of that existed at hour '0' of the birth of our intelligence. Even on the hypothetical assumption that the alien visitors had brought a suitable transmitting and receiving station with them, they could scarcely have deposited it on the planet earth, which was faced with earthquakes, floods and wars -after all, they weren't stupid! The passage of time alone, together with climatic changes, would have destroyed it. The cables and apparatuses the Americ an astronauts left on the moon have already disintegrated, even though the moon ha s no atmosphere. The extremes of heat and cold alone were enough to do the damage."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":" 158 The extraterrestrial visitors had made no mistakes in their planning! They knew that all mechanically produced and radiated transmission s were tied to the speed of light - they knew that electromagnetic waves could not reac h the receiving sets over vast interstellar distances. So what was the point of a lot of senseless and useless machinery? The visions of genuine visionaries advance mankind along the path of its development with giant strides. It is always surprising to find out the fields in which the advances are made: the spectrum of their potentialities is b road. In this connection I think it is important to realize that every brain is able to re ceive visions in so far as it is trained and ready to receive definite impulses through spec ific fixed points in the environment which influences it - in other words if it is open to communication with extraterrestrial fields of energy. When I say that all persons trained along egocentri c paths are predisposed to visions, there are the (rare) extraordinary cases where the extraterrestrial beings find the 'receivers of the millennium', the geniuses, whose brains seem to be waiting for the impulses with their grey cells vibrating. Leonardo da Vinci was one of these 'receivers of the millennium'! Born 1452, died 1519, he is gen erally known as a painter, architect and sculptor. Few people know that he was equally gifted as a natural scientist and technician. Da Vinci scholars have ma de fantastic discoveries about him in the last few years. As a painter he marked the z enith of the classical style; but as a scientist his works belong to our own age. He was the first technologist in the history of man kind. In his book of patterns of mechanical elements he described problems of hydrau lics, dynamics and static's. He was the first inspector of fortresses under Cesa re Borgia: he drew maps which are the earliest examples of modern cartography. He was asked for advice as 'war engineer' and produ ced plans for diverting the Arno in order to deprive Pisa, which was waging war with Florence, with its main artery of communication. He dissected corpses and wrote a treatise on human anatomy. He investigated the flight of birds and the laws go verning air currents, and drew plans for constructing an aircraft. His sketches contain a doctrine of the original mec hanical forces in nature, a whole cosmology. Through geological observations, he was led to inve stigate the origin of fossils. His biological studies made him the first scientific il lustrator. He realized that there would never be a perpetuum m obile because of the laws of gravity. For Sultan Bayazid II he conceived a bridge over th e Bosphorus - '12,000 ft over the sea, 600 over the land'. Such a bridge has been in service - since 1973."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":" 159 He invented a two-stage rocket which could fly 'mor e than three miles'. He devised a machine-tool for cutting cylindrical b ore holes, of the kind that has long been indispensable for manufacturing ball-bearings. He developed a gyroscopic system, like the one inve nted for blind flying by Speery Rand, but not until 1920. The multi-barrelled machine gun in modern jet-fight ers can be found on da Vinci's drawing paper. Leonardo da Vinci. He lived to the age of 67. He was painter, sculptor and architect. Brilliantly endowed. My notes on his fields of study are far from comple te. Each individual branch of knowledge he mastered wou ld normally have needed years of study; each individual result would have been th e issue of a whole lifetime's work. Surely an enormous, almost inconceivable amount of knowledge, must have been stored in Leonardo's brain? After all, his artistic production and his scientific researches and plans are worlds apart! Genius is not just diligence or the intelligent use of reason. I suspect that genius is mainly the ability to open a highly 'rained brain t o extraterrestrial energies. The extraterrestrial beings know what primordial knowle dge is stored in the grey cells. If they did not know it, they could not make the fuel of genius spark. That's it. The communication medium was and is the 'beast-brai n'. From the conveyor belt of modern research flow scientific proofs that man pos sesses parapsychological faculties which are against 'natural' laws. Only now, on the threshold of the third millennium, are we mentally capable of discovering the brain's unknown potentialities and perhaps of using them usefully and sensibly in future. We a re taking our first hesitant steps towards mutual communication. A few 'initiates' - I am not speaking of religious figures -have always had access to the wonderful unconscious, from which they summoned up great discoveries in visionary form. The Danish physicist Niels Bohr (1885-1962), who laid down the foundations of atomic theory, has described how he finally hit on the idea of his atomic model after years of vain re-search [26]. Neils Bohr dreamt he was sitting on a sun of burnin g gas. Hissing, spitting planets rushed by him and they all seemed to be attached to the sun they were circling by fine threads. Suddenly gas, sun and planets contracted a nd solidified. At this moment, said"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":" 160 Niels Bohr, he awoke. He knew at once that what he had seen in his dream was the atom model. Neils Bohr was canonized for this vision in 1922 - I beg your pardon - awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics! To me this 'dream' has the value of a vision. Hissi ng and spitting before the event, gas which solidifies and forms an image ... I have hear d all that before in another connection. Physicists have their world: they live daily and hourly with their formulae, diagrams and plans. Those are visual signals, which accompany them everywhere they go. Dialogues and discussions with colleagues, assistants and students revolve round their physical problems - acoustic signals wh ich are ever present. The stress of their work causes a 'psycho feedback' which they ca nnot escape. Consequently physicists can only have visions of images from the ir, working world, like Niels Bohr who had been fixated on the search for 'his' atom m odel for years. It appeared to him in a vision. We know whence religious enthusiasts d raw their visual and acoustic signals. In my opinion the physicist's 'dream' was caused by extraterrestrial impulses. They recalled the 'image' programmed in the unconscious - owing to psycho-feedback the atom model was present. Bohr's brain was trained fo r this exceptional case! We must liberate ourselves from the absurd idea that vision s are a religious privilege. That is only true if we accept religion's claim to exclusiv eness. The great men of the intellectual world are not clever enough to make ca pital out of their visions. They suddenly had an idea ... they suddenly 'saw' the so lution of a long-posed question clearly before their eyes ... the unconscious whisp ered something to them and it was an 'inner voice' which spoke to them. They describe the syndrome of many visions simply as a 'brilliant idea'. What sort of a saint would an ecclesiastical organization have made out of Albert Einstein if he had his bril liant ideas suddenly and by inspiration as one of their sheep! The great Niels Bohr was not the only scientist who frankly admitted that ideas that changed the world came to him in dreams. For example, there was the chemist Professor August Kekule' von Stradowitz (1829- 1896) - and what would the world be without his fla sh of genius? - who made vitally important advances in the theoretical bases of orga nic chemistry in the nineteenth century. Kekule discovered the quadrivalence of car bon and said that the truly revolutionary image of the 'closed-chain' structure of benzene (1865) had appeared to him suddenly as if in a dream. This visionary image became the basis of what is now the most important basic material for chemical manu facturing. There was also, to name just one example from our o wn day, the physiologist and pharmacologist Professor Otto Loewi (1873-1961), wh o taught at Graz and emigrated to New York. His fields of research were the physio logy of the metabolism and the physiology and pharmacology of the vegetative nervo us system. Once again we must ask what would have become of mankind without the v isionary dream that helped Loewi to become the first man to demonstrate the ch emical transference of nervous impulses in the nervous system (previously scholars had assumed that the transference was electrical). In 1936 Otto Loewi was awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine (for"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":" 161 his dream). Just imagine our stress-ridden world wi thout a single tranquillizer or any of the neuropsychological medicaments, and you will realize the epoch-making significance of Loewi's vision. When he 'received' it, he was ready for the impulses which, so I believe, extraterrestrial beings transm it when they think X day has come. There is one more comment I want to make. In 1968 I was spellbound and absorbed by The Double Helix, unquestionably a unique book in its description of a scientific disc overy that took place gradually. The book was (and is) all the more stimulating because the author, Harvard Professor James D. Watson, and his colleagues Francis H.C. Cr ick and Maurice H.F. Wilkins, solved one of the greatest mysteries of life: the m ake-up of the DNA molecule which contains all the hereditary information and cell-bu ilding plans of a living creature. In 1962 the team received the Nobel Prize for Medicine . I share the opinion of Nature's critic, who said th at if Watson had not already been awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine he should have got the prize for literature. What I had read in 1968 left me with the unforgetta ble impression of having been within an ace of participating in the growth of a d iscovery myself. Because it all stayed so fresh in my mind, I picked up the book se ven years later and read it again when my years of investigation had spurred me on to track down the phenomenon of visions. Now the sequence of signals that drove the researchers on appeared to me in a new light. Watson related how lightning-like and of ten phantasmagoric hints at possible solutions kept on cropping up, whether he was playing tennis, flirting or spending a pleasant week-end. Unannounced and unwanted (because he was amusing hi mself), a signal relating to the subject of his research would appear in his bra in quite unexpectedly, in situations that were worlds apart from his university laborato ry .... 'I huddled as close to the chimney as possible and dreamed of several DNA chai ns folded up in attractive and scientifically productive ways .... Soon after it h ad struck midnight, I was much happier. How often had Francis and I worried that t he DNA structure might turn out to be quite boring in the end. ... But now, to my s urprise and delight, the solution proved to be extremely interesting. I lay awake for more than two hours, sleepless but happy, and saw a pair of adenin remains whirling ro und before my eyes. Only for brief moments was I afraid that such a good idea co uld be wrong ....' These two quotations from Watson's book were not sp ecially chosen by me: these flashes of summer lightning on the way to the goal form the excitement of the book. From the point of view of my theory of visions, Wat son's detailed account indicates how he and his highly trained intellectual team wer e dominated by a series of encouraging impulses and finally by the idea that s olved the problem, all of which came from an intelligent energy-emitting force. The se men, who thought in formulae and codes, who thought the structures of molecules in images, who speculated in discussion, were suddenly 'ripe' for the summoning up of the discovery from their unconscious by extraterrestrials. Obviously this is still a speculation, but I am firmly convinced that from time immemorial, namely from th e day on which homo sapiens was made intelligent by artificial mutation, knowle dge stored in the brains of selected people has been summoned up. Always on X day."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":" 162 Such impulses, such dreams, have the value of visio ns for me. Physicists and doctors have their own world, they live daily with their im ages, their formulae diagrams, X- rays of organs and nerve structures and with the re actions of sick and healthy people. Those are their visual signals, which follow them e verywhere. Dialogues and discussions circle round their specific problems - acoustic signals which are always present. The continuing stress of their research wo rk produces a 'psycho-feedback' which they cannot escape. Consequently these men ca n only have visions (= dreams) from their own world. They call the inspirations id eas, and if they are not afraid of their colleagues they sometimes speak openly of the dreams they have had. In my view, dreams, as I have proved by certain exa mples, are released by extraterrestrial impulses. 'Images' programmed in t he unconscious are summoned up from it, because the brains were trained for this e xceptional case. We know where religious zealots draw their visual and acoustic si gnals from. The situation seems clear to me. Extraterrestrial i mpulses cause the brain to produce visions. The vision itself is not extraterrestrial; it 'reveals' the image desired by the visionary. An Arabic visionary 'sees' Mohammed or h is youngest daughter Fatima, a Hindu 'sees' Brahma, Vishnu or Shiva, a Red Indian 'sees' Manitu ... and a Catholic 'sees' Jesus, the Blessed Virgin, angels and saints . Every recipient of a vision reproduces the religious world of ideas familiar to him. If the news of a Christian vision becomes public an d is mysterious and attractive enough, it is accepted by the Church (provided it f its into the traditional system); or it is cast out root and branch, if the visionary rejec ts the version which is built up by suitable questioning. At the moment the visionary comes into the sphere o f an extraterrestrial impulse field - as I should like to call it - he becomes a medium . He cannot avoid the impulses which reach his brain. The brain begins to produce figures which are only visible to him. Visions may be immaterial or material (ectopla smic materializations), but they are always real to the visionary. Even though outsi de 'courts' presume to do so, it is impertinent to decide and judge which visions are g enuine and which are not. It is not the Blessed Virgin who gives the order to say the R osary. This order is inspired by the religious trappings with which the Christian vision ary's inner He is decorated. That is also where he gets the images of the beautiful ladi es, archangels and saints which become the objects of his visions. What happens in the brains of the numerous child vi sionaries? 'Something' flashes in the brain (radiated by extra terrestrial impulses). It is repeated. The child feels frightened. He seeks a refuge. A fe eling of peace and security comes over him unawares. He 'sees' mist, fine undulating veils, the air seems to shimmer, somewhere a light shines. These unreal illusory ima ges, in which the child would like to recognize the familiar portraits of Lord Jesus o r Mary, suddenly take shape. Finally he sees the familiar figures in the puzzle picture. He enjoys hearing messages of love and peace from them. A feeling of joy overcomes the child, he would like to nestle against them. A hint is necessary."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":" 163 Children are not specially selected by the extrater restrials. They do not know which receivers are in the energy field of their impulses . Strictly speaking the fact that children so frequently have visions would be pure c hance, were they not ideally prepared for the supernatural by their intensive re ligious upbringing, by their introverted life concentrated on the figures of the church. The childish brain is full of naive belief, crammed full of Christian images, say ings, stories and hymns. When extraterrestrial energies penetrate into minds thus prepared they produce exclusively religious visions. In other words, children are pre disposed by their religious environment. The extraterrestrials do not create th e conditions. In fact, faster than light communications produced oscillations in the sub-or supraconsciousness, and communication with extrater restrial beings was established. The impulses simply produced graphic (mute) represe ntations of peace, love and security, which the childish brain then transferred to the figures of the Holy Family. This takes the following form in the official recor ds of investigations of visions: \u0001 I know with absolute certainty that I had a vision. \u0001 I know that the vision disturbed me at first (fear) and then calmed me (love, peace). \u0001 I felt that the vision was strong and powerful; it was greater and more beautiful than anything I ever saw before. The vision did not actually say anything, but I sen sed its wish and desire to spread peace. (If visions took place in time of war, these feelings of the visionary would always become an appeal for peace - an expression o f the general subconscious!) I mean that all men would become one with the visio n. (Symbol of the extraterrestrial; we were a unity originally.) Visionaries do not realize how their visions take p lace. This realization is deliberately with held from them, because the extraterrestrial i mpulse field could be destroyed by their defensive reactions. For the visionary faced with the phenomenon, the only alternatives are GOOD and BAD. If it is good, it ca n only have been a manifestation of God - transformed into figures such as Jesus, Ma ry, Buddha, Shiva, Mohammed etc. If it is bad the vision can only have been fro m the devil and he has hundreds of terrifying masks and lots of evil words on his lips . In cases where the religious visionary is still Sceptical about identifying the figures he has seen, the Church takes very good care to see that he is left in no doubt. Why do the visionary figures so often want to have a pilgrimage church built on the site where they appear? There may be two reasons. T he visionary was once very happy at the scene of the vision and experienced th e most wonderful moments of his life there. Confused by the sensation, he manages t o give such a wonderful description of what he saw that everybody who would like to share in the promises and future miracles wants to erect a church. And no Church refuses buildings offered by those with money to burn. It is a wonderful experience for the visionary. He keeps on returning to the place where he was so happy ... like lovers who always se ek out their own bench in the park"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":" 164 to recapture their former bliss. Hypothetically we can assume that the extraterrestrial contact partners had picked out the place as partic ularly favourable and wanted to make sure that mutual contact was possible there. I s that why visions appear exclusively in places where there is no interferenc e? It would not occur to anyone to set up radio-astronomic aerials in terrain occupied by heavy industry. *** I am going to be the advocate of my own devil. Why must or should visions have anything at all to do with extraterrestrial beings? Are not visions purely the figments of psychopathic imaginations? Are not even genuine (photographed) visions caused by unknown po wers of the human brain? So why bring in extraterrestrial super beings? As soon as contact exists between visionary and vis ion, every vision spontaneously announces that it is 'extraterrestrial'. In the Christian vocabulary it goes like this. 'I am the mother of the universe.' 'I am the queen of heaven (Cosmos).' 'I am the immaculate conception.' (High-flown descr iption of the original artificial mutation?) The visionary describes transmitted groups of symbo ls in the words at his disposal, using analogous images. The claim made by visions to be of extraterrestrial origin would not be sufficient by itself. For example, when an angel appears to the e ighteen-year-old Joseph Smith, the founder of the Mormon Religion, and says he knows t he secret place where tablets with the history of mankind are hidden, and if it t hen turns out that the tablets are found exactly at the spot described, this means to me that extraterrestrial beings have given Joseph Smith information that could only be k nown to them. (Because they prepared the hiding place on our planet thousands o f years ago!) What was later made out of the vision phenomenon (it was Jesus!), belon gs to the fairy-tale factory in which religions are manufactured. 'Belief, not disb elief, is what is dangerous in our society'. [27] However much these interesting details may arouse o ur interest, we must not lose sight of a central phenomenon, the solar miracle! W hether at San Damiano, Fatima or Heroldsbach, tens of thousands observed - and put i t on record - a gigantic flying wheel with spokes, revolving furiously in the sky. Sometimes this wheel slowed down its revolutions; it moved in front of the sun and p ast it. Who is not reminded of the grandiose space-station in the film 2001 by such de scriptions? Space-stations are like gigantic wheels which turn slowly on a central axis . This creates in the external rooms round their 'equator' the artificial gravity that i s necessary for interstellar journeys. In the centre, at the hub of the wheel, are the energy stations from which the propulsive forces are led to the actual 'wheel' down spoke lik e communication shafts."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":" 165 Is that also a possible explanation of solar miracl es? I do not think it is out of the question. The tens of thousands who witnessed the p henomena are no fools and their descriptions of what they saw tally to such an exte nt that some 'object' must have existed for them to see. Space journeys over interstellar distances last for thousands of years, according to our terrestrial chronology. I consider it plausible tha t extraterrestrial brains akin to ours order 'visionaries' through apparitions to lead lar ge groups of people to a place named by them on a day and at an hour also named by them. At this point of time X the space-station, travelling somewhere among the stars , uses its concentrated energy to transmit the picture of the station. Result: tens o f thousands of receivers on our planet see a gigantic gleaming wheel, flashing all colours of the rainbow, that sails majestically past the sun. Then why is this phenome non not visible from all places illuminated by the sun? Well, the extraterrestrials , by fixing the specific place and specific time, had also chosen the angle from which their signals would be perceivable (via visions). The question remains why the extraterrestrials star ted such a manoeuvre. To me it is conceivable that they wanted to give a clear sign. 'Here we are: we live in a great space-station and you puny men must understand that your intelligence originates from us who are capable of staging such a spectacle .' We earthworms crippled by our upbringing do not rea lize this, but turn the message into a religious miracle. I'll wear sackcloth and a shes if I'm wrong, but I can't see miracles in physical events. Genuine visions have been vitally concerned in open ing up the consciousness of mankind. All founders of religions, who went among men inspired by these phenomena, announced that it was not they themselve s who were speaking, but that 'that which is in me and above me' was speaking thr ough them De facto they often told mankind about new things which were far above the state of knowledge and experience of their time. But, thank heaven, founders of religions and adepts were not the only recipients of visions. There are also the great brains which got their ideas from contacts with extraterrestrial beings. We talk of geniuses. They are the chosen few, those ripe for contact, who are able to convert extraterrestrial i mpulses into thought molecules. The scientifically trained and investigating brain, whi ch grasps symbols and transforms them into knowledge, does not talk about visions. A t some point in the biographies of the great men in human history moments occur in whi ch visions, illuminations or inspirations caused the great turning point or the decisive earth-shattering realization (the idea). The justification of the visions of gre at men is their contribution to mankind. Religions, especially their founders, use visions l ike 'crumbs which fall from their masters' table' (Matthew, 15:27). The visions that are useless from the religious point of view, the visions and illuminations which great men get from the supernatural, are the ones which bring progress.
