I was about 10 years old and listened to ourreligious instructor telling us that once a battle had taken place in Heaven.One day the archangel Lucifer had appeared before the throne of God with hislegion of angels and had declared, 'We are not going to serve you any more!' Atwhich point the Almighty God had ordered the archangel Michael to chuck Luciferout of Heaven, along with all his rebellious followers. Michael duly carried outthis command with his flaming sword. From that day---according to our R.E.teacher---Lucifer had become the Devil and all his followers were burning inHell.That evening, for the first time in my young life, I was really pensive. Wechildren had been told that Heaven was a place of absolute bliss, a place whereall the good people went after they died. A place too where all souls becameintimately one with God. How could conflict occur in such paradisiacal realms?Where absolute joy ruled, where oneness with God was perfect, there could be noopposition, no quarrel. Why, oh why, should Lucifer and all his angels suddenlyrebel against an almighty, all-loving God?My mother, whom I asked for an explanation, was unable to help. With God, shesaid, wearing a troubled expression, everything was possible. That's how it hadto be. Even the impossible.Later, at high school, where we were taught Latin, I understood that the nameLucifer was formed out of the two words lux (light) and ferre (to do, to carry).Lucifer really means Light-maker or Bringer of Light. Of all creatures, was theDevil supposed to be the Bringer of Light? My realisation, based on the Latin,made the whole business even more bewildering.Twenty years later, I had thoroughly studied the Old Testament, as Christianscall the ancient traditions. There I read passages from the Jewish prophetIsaiah (c. 740 BC):How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! How art thou cutdown to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! For thou hast said in thineheart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God:I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation . . . (Isaiah 14, 12-13)1These verses from Isaiah may have been altered during the course of themillennia. But what might he have been thinking about originally? In theso-called 'Revelation' of John (author of the prophecy of the apocalypse) onecan read another clear and definite allusion to battles in Heaven in chapter 12,verse 7:And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon;and the dragon fought and his angels, and prevailed not; neither was their placefound any more in heaven.Curious. The great traditions of other peoples too support the idea that thesebattles in heaven were not entirely made up. In The Egyptian Book of the Dead, acollection of texts that were placed in a grave with a mummified body so thedeceased would know how to behave in the Beyond, we read how Ra, the mighty Sungod, fought against the rebellious children of heaven. The god Ra, we read,never left his 'egg' during the entire battle.2Battles in Heaven? In outer space? Or did our ignorant forefathers merely meanthe battles between good and evil that are fought within humans? Did theyperhaps imagine the atmospheric battle during a thunderstorm and project it onto a battle in outer space? A battle of dark clouds against the Sun? Or did theorigin of this bewildering thinking lie in a solar eclipse, where somethingterrible was trying to eat up the Sun? All these natural explanations do notreally take us any further, as I will demonstrate. If the battle between Luciferand Michael were only to be found in the ancient Jewish sphere, one could easilygloss over it. But it is not the only example, and very old stories only toooften show up astonishing similarities.For thousands of years, Tibetan monasteries preserved texts called dzyan. Someoriginal text, which may or may not still exist, must have been the source ofthe many dzyan fragments that have turned up in Indian temple libraries. We aretalking of hundreds of sheets written in Sanskrit, sandwiched between two piecesof wood. There, one can read that in the 'fourth world age,' the sons wereordered to create likenesses of themselves. A third of the sons refused to carryout the command:The older wheels turned down and up. The spawn of the Mother filled the All.Battles were fought between the creators and the destroyers, and battles aboutSpace . . . Do your calculations, Lanoo, if you wish to obtain the true age ofyour wheel. (author's emphasis)3I discussed parts of Greek mythology in my last book.4 Greek mythology alsobegins with a battle in heaven. The children of Ouranos rebelled against theheavenly order and the creator. Terrible battles ensued and the Zeus, the Fatherof the gods, is only one of the victors. Prometheus was one of those who foughtagainst Zeus, and this took place in 'Heaven,' as Prometheus was the one whostole the fire from Heaven and brought it down to Earth. Prometheus---Lucifer.The Bringer of Light?On the other side of the world, far from Greece, lies New Zealand. Even ahundred years ago, ethnologist John White was asking the old priests of theMaori about their legends. Their legends too begin with a battle in Heaven.5Some of the sons of God rebelled against their father. The leader of these spacewarriors was called Ronga-mai, and after a victorious battle, he allowed himselfto be feted on Earth.His appearance was like a brilliant star, like a flame, like a sun. Wherever helanded, the Earth was churned up, dust clouds obscured one's view, the noisesounded like thunder and, from a distance, like the rushing sound inside a seashell.These accounts cannot just be disposed of by shoving them into thepsychologist's bag. A very ancient memory has been preserved here. In the DronaParva,6 the oldest Indian tradition, the battles in space are described in thesame manner as in old Jewish legends that are not part of the Old Testament.7There too, there is mention of 'holy wheels,' 'in which the cherubim reside.'This is, of course, not just anywhere, but 'in Heaven' and 'among the stars.'Etymologists assure us that one should see all this symbolically.8 These strangestories9 are only myths. Only? Which family tree should we climb up, then, ifall that is to be found in mythology are symbols? And if they are symbols, whatdo the symbols stand for? The term 'symbol' comes from the Greek symballein andmeans 'to throw together.' If myths are only to be perceived symbolically, Iwould really like to know what exactly has been 'thrown together.' An attempt toside with the vagueness of myths will not take us one step further. We havebecome a society that simply accepts and believes the most contradictorytraditions, believing in the way religions would have us believe. But evidentlywe are not prepared to accept a few facts. When I maintain that the Holy Book,and the first books of the Old Testament in particular, bristle withcontradictions and horror stories, and that the God who spoke to Moses couldnever be looked upon as the true God of Creation, people become offended andindignantly demand proof. When I present the evidence, I get publicly clobberedfor my pains. Why? Because we are not supposed to question beliefs and faith. Ofcourse, that only applies to the beliefs of the larger religious groups. If Iattack the beliefs of a smaller group, the rule no longer applies.Mankind has arrived in a new millennium. For myself, I think it is moreresponsible to analyse the old stories and target new goals."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 1: A Different Kind of R.E. Lesson[The_Gods_Were_Astronauts_split_001.html#filepos1634]\"Science is the only remedy against superstition.\"---HENRY T. BUCKLETHERE is no arguing about the fact that human beings doubt and even despair ofGod. Everyone is familiar with the question: how could God let it happen? Itmight refer to the millions of maltreated and murdered Jews in the Second WorldWar, or to the torture victims of all dictator-ships. How could God allowinnocent children to be tortured and killed? How can he permit naturalcatastrophes that bring starvation and suffering to so many peoples? How couldhe allow Christians to be persecuted in his name, allow humans to be slaughteredin dreadful ways, allow Christian zealots to put other Christians, witches orthose allegedly possessed by the Devil, to death by unimaginable, atrociousmethods of torture? The list of questions, about how God could have allowed allthese things, is endless---and the answers, which we swallow along with theincomprehensible, are always the same. God has, so we are talked into believing,reserved a special place in Heaven for those maltreated victims. There, in thatkingdom beyond, they will be well rewarded. God's counsel is incomprehensiblebut wise. Man thinks but God guides. We should not pose questions about the'why,' credulous theologians assure us. God alone knows 'why.'Maybe. But this same God---so the Christian, Jewish and Muslim traditiongoes---is supposed to have created us 'in his own image.' We read this inGenesis and it is valid for the three great world religions:And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let themhave dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and overthe cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepethupon the earth. So God created man in his own image, in the image of God hecreated him; male and female created he them. (Genesis 1, 26-7; author'semphasis)If man is the image or likeness of God, he should also be intelligent. And noone could dispute that what we understand as God must be the highest of allimaginable intelligences. Intelligent life forms just happen to have the habitof asking questions and searching for answers. Intelligent beings do not believein any old nonsense. And if we are not in God's image, we are still left withthe fact that we are intelligent beings, either with or without 'God's image.'Here, by 'intelligence,' I mean culture in the widest possible sense, somethingthat separates us from animals. And there is another thing: God should not onlybe the power of intelligence to the highest degree, but naturally infallible aswell. But the God we meet in the Old Testament is not infallible. After God hascreated man and woman, he saw: 'it was very good' (Genesis 1, 31). That is whatone would expect from divine work. But this same Lord, who created man, shortlyafterwards regrets what he has done:And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved himat his heart. And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from theface of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls ofthe air; for it repenteth me that I have made them. (Genesis 6, 6)Incomprehensible! First this infallible God creates animals and man, discoversthat it is good, and then he repents of his deed. This is divine?A further characteristic that has to be attributed to God is timelessness. Atrue God must stand outside time. He would never have to try out experiments andthen wait to see how they turn out. But this is exactly what happens in the OldTestament, several times. After God had created man, he set them down in theGarden of Eden. There, Adam and Eve were allowed to do anything they likedexcept for one thing: they were not allowed to eat the apple. It is beside thepoint whether the apple stands as a symbol for something else: whether for sinor the first sexual act. A prohibition exists. This timeless God should haveknown from the start that his creations would circumvent thisprohibition---which is exactly what happens, whereupon the deeply offended Godchases our first ancestors out of Paradise. The Christian Church has evenmanaged to top this with further illogical concepts: all the descendants of Adamand Eve are saddled with an ominous 'original sin' that can only be paid off bythe blood sacrifice of God's only son. A truly dreadful thought.I am---and I repeat this in each of my books---a believer in God and aGod-fearing person. I pray too, every day. My poor brain is not capable ofdefining God. Many cleverer people than I have tried to---and still, for me, Godis something quite extraordinary and certainly unique. I am in agreement withthe great world religions: there can only be one God. And that which we call Godmust be infallible, timeless, omnipresent and omnipotent. Those are the veryleast charac-teristics we have to concede to God with deep respect. It willnever be possible to describe God or to nail down the Holy Spirit anywhere on atimeline.Science tells us, at the beginning, hydrogen was all there was, or the Big Bang.And what caused the Big Bang? What was before the Big Bang? This Big Bang, thesuper-clever astro-physicists tell us, happened about 15 thousand million yearsago and lasted a fraction of a second. But we are unable to explain thatfraction of a second. Nothing arises from nothing---even the most intricatemathematical formulas will not overcome that obstacle.Albert Einstein (1879-1955), in addition to the theory of relativity, alsoformulated the lesser-known theory of gravitation. Both explain the macrocosm,our 'greater universe' so to speak. Then along came another genius from thefield of physics, Werner Heisenberg (1901-1976), and developed formulas ofquantum physics, which to this day can only be understood by specialists. Thebehaviour of the microcosm can be explained with the help of quantum physics.What is going on behind those subatomic particles? To be exact, bothconcepts---the gravitation theory and quantum physics---should meet in the BigBang theory. But the mathematical theories that attempt to connect the twoconcepts turn out to be just absurd numbers and formulas that do not make sense.Nothing seems to fit together. A plausible theory that would presumably becalled 'quantum gravitation' does not exist. The breeding chamber of theuniverse has remained locked. Space and time, which supposedly did not existbefore the Big Bang, came into being at the same time as the Big Bang. But whatdid exist before space and time began to be?Space and time came into being simultaneously, as our needle-sharp, analyticalastro-physicists' minds have discovered. Innumerable calculations were carriedout and computers fed with data to arrive at this epoch-making realization.International conferences were organized and deeply meaningful papers were read.Scientists could have arrived at the answer much more easily. Plato's Timaeusdialogue, written about 2,500 years ago, tells us:132So time then came into being with the heavens in order that, having come intobeing together, they should also be dissolved together if ever they aredissolved . . .If we start with the question 'What is God?,' we could equally well ask, 'Who(or what) created God?' There is no end---or better, no beginning. Human beingsmade a father figure out of God, a person who commands and punishes, praises andcriticises. This is certainly not what Creation is about. Theologians argue thatwe should grant this creator being the ability to be able to transform into aperson at any moment, and to take on human form. That may well be. But eventhen, this God-Person should retain its divine attributes. Naturally, I amfamiliar with concepts of God from different religions and philosophicalschools, and in the end, they all boil down to the same thing: whatever God is,'it' should be eternal, timeless, perfect and omni-present. It was AlbertEinstein who coined the phrase, 'God does not play dice.'The one in the Old Testament did. And in several demonstrable cases he did notforesee the future, as can be seen, for example, with regard to the prophet Ezra(Hebrew: succour). Ezra was one of the few prophets who returned to Jerusalemaround 458 BC, after the Babylonian captivity.In the Old Testament there is just one chapter about Ezra, but the apocryphaltexts contain much more about him. There we find Ezra asking God---or hisemissaries---about the signs that would come, and about his own life. The answerwas as follows:I can only tell you about some of the signs you ask about. I am not able to tellyou anything about your future life, as I do not know myself.10 (author'semphasis)Now, Ezra does not belong in the same period as Moses, and it may be that he washaving his conversations with somebody else, only not with God. But the God ofAdam and Eve's times did not seem to know what was going on either. After Evehad served up the apple to her husband, he hid himself in the bushes 'out offear.' But God does not seem to know where Adam is:And the Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou? (Genesis3, 9)Adam assures the Lord that he has heard him, but had hidden himself because hewas 'ashamed.' Then, the Lord wants to know who had told Adam he was naked, andasks whether he has eaten of the tree that was forbidden. Adam replies:The woman who thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.(Genesis 3, 12)According to this version, God was definitely not in the picture. He did notknow where Adam was, and had no idea that Eve had tempted him to eat the apple.People who believe the Bible say that such passages should not be takenliterally, everything should be seen symbolically. Well, all right then, buteven the 'symbolic illogic' does not make sense, as we shall see.After Adam works out how to have sex, Eve bears her sons Cain and Abel. Abelbecomes a shepherd and Cain becomes an arable farmer---two crisis-proof,subsidized professions. The two boys bring sacrifices before the Lord. And whatdoes this infallible God do? He acknow-ledges Abel and his sacrifice with awell-pleased eye, but does not acknowledge Cain and his sacrifice (Genesis 4,4-5).Up to this point neither Cain nor Abel had any experience of double standards.No wonder Cain reacted in a disgruntled way to this partisan God:And the Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth, and why is thy countenancefallen? (Genesis 4, 6)An all-knowing God should have known. But this one does not even prevent Cainfrom killing his innocent brother Abel. He even has to ask:And the Lord said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother?And he says: I know not: am I my brother's keeper? (Genesis 4, 9)Although 'God' ends up punishing Cain, the latter is still destined to becomethe progenitor of a phenomenally large lineage that was to make biblicalhistory. But Cain is not the only murderer in God's eyes, as the much laterMoses carries the same stigma. I will come back to Moses later.The biblical narrative begins to turn decidedly dramatic in chapter 6:And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, anddaughters were born unto them, that the sons of God saw the daughters of menthat they were fair; and they took wives of all which they chose . . .There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sonsof God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, thesame became mighty men which were of old, men of renown. (Genesis 6, 4)I shall not discuss those giants any more, as I have already done so in myprevious book.4 The question of those 'sons of God' has also come up before.9 Ijust do not comprehend how those who believe in the Bible, and who usually quoteall manner of passages from the Holy Book, always seem to ignore these crucialpassages. Yet, it is quite clear that what is spoken of is 'the sons of God.' Ican nowadays only manage a weary smile in the face of the scholarly battles thathave raged for centuries around these words and resulted in thousands ofcontradictory comments. Here, the term 'sons of God' has been translated as'fallen angels;' there, they have been interpreted as 'renegade spirit beings'or as 'Guardians of the Heavens. It's enough to make one tear out one's hair!Three little words have twisted Faith into its opposite. The experts who areable to read Hebrew, however, know exactly what these three words are referringto---'those who descended from above.'In the end, this conflict among theologians about the meaning of the term 'sonsof God' is irrelevant. Whether they are interpreted as 'rebel angels' or'Guardians of Heaven,' God should have known beforehand what they were up to.Evidently he had no idea. And those who would like to make 'spirit beings' outof these 'sons of God' should read on in the Holy Book. These spirit beings havesex with humans. Spirits do not do this.Confusion reigns supreme in the Book of Genesis. The thing that saddens me isthat millions of people believe that this contradictory God spoken of in Genesisis identical with the grandiose Spirit who created the universe. And this is notjust in popular belief---no, even in theological specialist literature, whichtwists and justifies every contradiction with unbelievable sophistry, the God ofthe Old Testament is seen as the universal, only God with all the divineattributes. Famous Jesuit and professor of theology Karl Rahner, who teacheswhole hosts of young priests, assures us that the story of the Old Testament'originates from the God who, in the end, revealed himself in Jesus Christ.'11The text of the Old and New Testaments, according to Rahner, all have the samesource. God 'has made a special covenant' with the people of Israel, which from'time immemorial' has, however, been planned as a mere prologue to the coming ofChrist. Oh, and the Old Testament was planned right from the beginning as an'open movement, steered by God, towards final salvation.'The very inventive and wordy theology professors do concede that the OldTestament has been cobbled together out of diverse texts that originate fromdifferent times and are by various authors. Patriarchal reports originating fromthe dim and distant past had been collected together. They even admit to'artistic licence' from various theological schools, all according to the needsof their time. For example, there is the insinuation that the histories ofIsrael, such as those of the Yahvists or those of the descendants of King David,were only aimed at legitimising Solomon's throne or the take-over of Palestineby Israel. In the face of such claims, there is no need to be surprised thatJews and Christians find it so hard to get on. In spite of all these concessionsand twists of interpretation a kind of abstruse know-all attitude prevails intheological circles, which maintains that the historical narratives in the Bibleare 'without exception reports of the consummation of the Word of God. Thisformula is universally applicable.' The latter statement is according totheology professor Jacques Guillet.11So, how is this supposed to look? The Old Testament is supposed to be 'amovement, directed by God, towards ultimate salvation' (Rahner). This plan is'universally applicable' (Guillet). And so that there may be no doubts at all,the story of the Old Testament and the New Testament originate from a singleGod, who revealed himself in Christ, 'so that the text of the Old and NewTestaments should have the same source' (Rahner). At the same time, many of thepatriarchal reports are supposed to have originated 'in the dim and distantpast' and still be 'without exception, reports of the consummation of God'sWord.'The only remedy for this highbrow theological nonsense is probably education.One should not presume to tell me what I should be seeing. I am able to read.The story of the Deluge and Noah's Ark is generally well known, and I have dealtwith it in previous books. For those of you who are new to my books, I willmerely repeat: what you read about the Deluge in Genesis chapter 6, verse 9,originates from much older, Babylonian and even Sumerian texts.12, 13 Somebodyin the distant past has, therefore, inserted a story into the Book of Books, theHoly Writ, and also invented the name Noah; and all of this originates fromcompletely different sources. And still---according to theology---the OldTestament deals 'without exception with reports of the consummation of the Wordof God' (Jacques Guillet).After the great Flood, and when the Ark landed on top of a mountain, Noah made asacrifice to the Lord, and according to Genesis chapter 8, verse 21: 'And theLord smelled a sweet savour.' This is not very different from what happens inthe Epic of Gilgamesh. Utnapishtim, who has survived the Flood, sacrifices alamb, grain, cedar wood and myrtle on the mountain, 'The gods smelled the odour,and the odour rose pleasantly to the nostrils of the gods. And the godsassembled like flies around the sacrifice.'13Strange gods, who are able to smell frying meat!After this pleasant odour of cooked meat, the God of the Old Testament decidesthat he will 'not again curse the ground any more for man's sake' (Genesis 8,21). And also 'neither will I again smite any more every living thing, as I havedone.' He invites Noah and his sons to be fruitful and to multiply and replenishthe Earth. God also states clearly that all animals should be subject to man:And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth,and upon every fowl of the air, and all that moveth upon the earth, and upon allthe fishes of the sea; into your hands are they delivered. (Genesis 9, 2)Animal lovers will probably never be able to follow comfortably this divinecommand. In the older parallel story from the Epic of Gilgamesh, there areseveral gods who smell the frying meat and gather above the Ark. The gods beginto squabble with each other and harangue the god Enlil who caused the Flood. 'Owisest of gods, O great warrior hero, how could you, taking no counsel, bring onthe Deluge?'13In the end, 'the God of the earth and all lands' climbs 'into the ship,' leadsUtnapishtim together with his wife out of the Ark, lays his hands on them andblesses them. (An additional Flood story with a similar content is described inthe Enuma elish, from the Babylonian 'tutelary poem of the Creation.'14)Whoever it was who was identified as God in these sources, he was definitely notthe Creator of the Universe. The Old Testament and the Epic of Gilgameshdescribe the same events, however, with the decided difference that, in the epicof Gilgamesh an eye-witness is featured who writes the report in the firstperson. Utnapishtim is the survivor of the Flood just like Noah in the Bible,but in the latter, the story is told in the third person.The God of the Old Testament too blesses his protégés and seals an 'eternalcovenant' with them and for all their descendants:And the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. (Genesis 9,15)Really, that is rather a reassuring statement, if it actually came from themouth of God. Earth-dwellers of all times should never have to fear the effectsof a meteorite strike in the sea. As astronomers today are aware, such strikesare quite possible, with terrifyingly destructive conse-quences for allhumankind. But this promise does not actually originate from the Creator of theUniverse, from that incomprehensible intelligence of the first source. Theancient texts in the Gilgamesh epic and in the Old Testament speak of othergods. Gods? Surely, the Old Testament speaks only of one God? I have already hadto destroy this illusion in my previous books. The Hebrew word that stands for'God' in Genesis is 'elohim.'This is a plural word. There is no singular'elohim.'What is meant is 'the gods.' This may be a sobering thought, but itremains the truth.The Jewish, Islamic and Christian world religions are based on the books ofGenesis. Islam treats the old stories of Moses and Solomon (Suleiman) asrespectful traditions. The Torah scholars of the Jewish world religion havealways been not only believers but have also seen their traditions as subjectsof interpretation and research, and their work can be read, for example, in themany midrash volumes. These literary works known as midrashim contain theresearch of many centuries of outstanding Jewish scholars. A midrash is a workof interpretation, a search for meaning.15, 16 It is only the Christian religionthat constructs the 'Word of God' out of the Old Testament texts, 'generallyapplicable and without exception reports of the consummation of a Word of God'(Rahner).Now, no religion just 'appears.' Every religion has a history, a kind ofUr-Religion, as humans were supposed to be able to keep to and live according tothe pronouncements of their forefathers. There is no written evidence of thisearliest religion. It probably took centuries for the various stories to becompressed into a Story. Each of these stories will presumably contain a kernelof truth, but to designate all these stories together as the 'Word of God' comesclose to an insult to the Infinite Power of Creation (provided, of course, thatthe intelligence behind Creation can be insulted by such microscopic creationsas humans). The traditions collected together in the Old Testament do talk ofgods who were active some time and somewhere, but they do not fit under theumbrella of an intelligent original spirit.The God of the Old Testament, in fact, creates several 'eternal covenants' withAbraham (Genesis 13, 15; Genesis 15, 5; Genesis 15, 18). One really divinecovenant would have been sufficient. Again and again, burnt offerings andtribute are demanded. I find it quite inexplicable that a metaphysical Godshould have required them. Then there is the rather unsavoury story of Sodom andGomorrah. It appears like blasphemy to attribute that event to the intelligentcreative power of God.First of all, the biblical God hears that people are committing horrible sins inSodom and Gomorrah. But he does not seem to be certain: 'I will go down now, andsee whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is comeunto me' (Genesis 18, 21). God hasn't a clue. Very sad. Then God informs Abrahamof what he intends to do, and Abraham begins to plead with him. This is divine?Finally, God sends two angels to Sodom to save Lot and his family from thedestruction of the two cities (Genesis 19, 1 ff). To begin with, these angelsintend to spend the night in a public place (why do angels need to sleep?), butLot implores them not to do this and to come and rest in his house. Thisevidently does not suit the lustful mob of Sodom and immediately they surroundLot's house and demand the two angels be handed over to them, 'that we may knowthem.' The pressure must have been great, as Lot offers the lecherous people histwo virgin daughters: 'Do ye to them as is good in your eyes.' The sodomites arenot interested. They begin to charge Lot's house and break down the door. Now,at last, the angels intervene. With some kind of secret weapon they 'smote themen that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great, sothat they wearied themselves to find the door' (Genesis 19, 11 ff). Thesituation comes dramatically to a head. The two angels pressure Lot and hisfamily to leave the city immediately. Lot is still hesitating. The angels becomeforceful. They drag Lot, his wife and two daughters out of the house:Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain;escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed. (Genesis 19, 17)In spite of this urgent appeal, Lot is still complaining. Instead of fleeing tothe hills, he insists on staying in the little town of Zoar because he will feelsafer there. Resigned to his stubbornness, the angels declare:Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither.(Genesis 19, 22)But the Lord---the good Lord?---caused fire and brimstone to rain on Sodom andGomorrah, 'from the Lord out of heaven: and he overthrew those cities, and allthe plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon theground.'Evidently, a rather wayward brood was flourishing in the cities of Sodom andGomorrah. But should the all-knowing God not have known beforehand what wasgoing on? And why the sudden haste, the extreme pressure? Was there a countdownrunning, which neither the angels nor God could stop? What kind of a God wasthis?My little Bible lesson is not intended to do anything more or less than make acertain observation: a god figure is described here who makes mistakes, errs,feels regret, who is capable of bloody acts of destruction and is not timeless.All of these are non-divine attributes that do not go with the perception of abeing that stands above all things. It is also no use demanding a definition ofGod here, because the Old Testament tells the story this way and in no other.Humans are encouraged to believe that these narratives are God's word.Just in passing: the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah was not the onlydestruction of sinful cities. The Indian epic Mahabharata tells the same storywith a few special ingredients:17 with chagrin one reads about a weapon thatcaused the city and its entire surroundings to be burned out completely. Anhorrific sight presented itself: the corpses no longer looked like those ofhuman beings; the burnt bodies had been unrecognizable. All food had becometoxic and never before had human beings seen such a terrible weapon, let aloneheard of it.While the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah is described in two sentences, theaccount in the eighth book of the Mahabharata is more detailed. In both cases, agod was responsible for the dreadful destruction. The God of all religions? I amnot so concerned with understanding the old accounts, sentence by sentence, wordfor word. These are concepts from a very distant past. Some god or the other, orgods, got nasty, broke off a failed experiment, or supported a preferred groupof humans with their superior weapons. These gods always came from heaven or thesky. The standard assumption---that our ancestors must have placed theirperceived gods in the heavens, because the heavens with the stars stood for theeternal or the unattainable---does not stand up to any kind of criticalanalysis, as there were plenty of figures that came from the darkness of theunderworld. The descriptions of these battles of the gods in the heavens and thebehavior of those heavenly beings on Earth are not explainable either poeticallyor psychologically. In addition to that, the descriptions are much too precise.Also, these heavenly beings spoke. They gave advice, commands and ofteninstructions of a technical nature. The God of the Old Testament providesexcellent examples of this.He demands the sacrifice of Abraham's only son 'whom thou lovest' (Genesis 22).Shortly before the terrible deed can be carried out, God sends an angel fromHeaven to prevent this incomprehensible act. Theologians explain thiscontradiction as a test. God wanted to see whether Abraham would be prepared toslaughter his only son for God. He should have known this before. As a rewardfor this non-deed, which was only prevented by the intervention of an angel, Godblesses Abraham and promises to make his descendants as numerous as 'the starsof the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore' (Genesis 22, 17).This is a promise that, in its first phase, could only be realized by polygamy.There is plenty of polygamy in the Book of Genesis (examples Genesis, chapters25, 29 and 34).In the second Book, called Exodus, the main part is played by Moses. A man fromthe house of Levi had married a Levite woman who gave birth to a pretty boychild. Three months after his birth, the mother could no longer hide the childfrom the Egyptians and wove a basket out of reeds, into which she laid thechild. Naturally the basket was made water-tight with pitch and bitumen. One ofPharaoh's daughters pulled the basket out of the Nile and adopted the child.A touching story which originally, however, could have taken place in India. Wefind the same story in the Book called Adi Parva of the Mahabharata. Theunmarried young woman Kunti had been waylaid by the Sun god, and the result ofthis unusual union was a son who was unusually beautiful because his face shonelike the Sun. The former virgin Kunti feared the scandal, so she made awater-tight casket and secretly abandoned the small child to the river. Acourageous woman called Adhirata fished the casket out of the water, brought upthe child as her own and called him Karna.A third story with the very same content was literally dug up in the 19thcentury from the hill of Kuyunyik, the former Niniveh, by a Professor GeorgeSmith. British archaeologists uncovered an entire library of clay tablets thatbelonged to the Assyrian king Assurbanipal, and that included, among otherthings, the life story of King Sargon I (c. 2400 BC). He too, so the story goes,was laid in a reed basket secured with pitch, and floated down the Euphrates.This strange little boat was found by a water carrier called Akki and the littleboy was finally brought up by a princess. About 1,000 years lie between thestory of Sargon and the one about Moses. But just how many years lie between thestory of the Indian virgin Kunti and the story of Moses, we cannot nowdetermine.God's word? Who copied it from whom?When Moses had grown up, he watched his Hebrew brothers performing the work ofslaves. He was the witness to a killing of a Hebrew by an Egyptian foreman:And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, heslew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. (Exodus 2, 12)The following day Moses watched two Hebrews quarrelling. Moses tried to mediate,but one Hebrew answered:'Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? Intendest thou to kill me, as thoukilledst the Egyptian?'Moses was afraid, as his murder of the day before appeared to be publicknowledge. He fled to the land of Midian, took as his wife the young daughter of(allegedly) a priest and begat his first son, Gershon, with her. No special roleappears to have been intended for the latter in the Bible, as with one exception(Exodus 18, 2 ff), he disappears again without a trace.While Moses was tending his father-in-law's sheep, he came to the sacredmountain called Horeb and watched the strange spectacle of flames burning in athorn-bush without the bush being consumed. Curious, Moses moved closer, and tohis astonishment heard a voice coming from the thorn-bush. The voice commandedhim to take off his shoes and step closer, as he was on holy ground. Finally,the voice told him it was the God of his forefathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.'And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God.' God tells Mosesthat he knows about the suffering of the Israelites who live in captivity inEgypt, and he has 'come down to deliver them' and lead the Israelites into abeautiful, wide land in which milk and honey flowed.So far, so good, one assumes. The good Lord has ordered a murderer to lead theIsraelites out of Egypt, but with God everything has a reason. He sends Moses toPharaoh to demand the release of his countrymen, and when the latter refuses, hesubjects Egypt to various plagues.'And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mightyhand. And I will stretch out my hand and smite Egypt with all mywonders.'(Exodus 3, 19 ff).Before the plaguing begins, however, God gives an order to steal from theEgyptians. The Israelites are not to leave empty-handed, but should borrowdiverse pieces of jewellery and clothing, in order to 'spoil the Egyptians'(Exodus 3, 22 and 12, 35-7). This is exactly what is said in the Bible anddoesn't correspond at all with the commandment that God later gives to hispeople: 'Thou shalt not steal or covet they neighbour's property.' This alsoshows one of the reasons why Pharaoh did not immediately allow the Israelites togo.During the further course of the story, Aaron plays the second role in theseevents. Who was Aaron? The Jewish Encyclopedia18has the answer: Aaron was theoldest son of the Hebrew Amram of the tribe of Levi. Moses, his second son, wasthree years younger and their mutual sister, Miriam, was a few years older.Aaron, great-grandson of High Priest Levi, followed his priestly calling withinhis tribe. While Moses was brought up at the Egyptian royal court, Aaron livedwith relatives in the eastern borderlands of Egypt and was known as anoutstanding orator. When Moses received God's command to lead the Israelites outof Egyptian captivity, he asked his brother Aaron for help. The fact was thatMoses was not at all a good speaker; he required an official spokesman, whowould present Pharaoh with Israel's demands. During the years that followed,through the Exodus, Aaron advanced to become Moses's deputy and he became HighPriest; he enjoyed the special protection of the 'Lord in the pillar of cloud.'Whenever problems appeared, which required technologically gifted understanding,Aaron was on the spot. He was known as a magician, who could conjure upprocesses that looked like miracles to the masses. Once, as we read in Exodus,Aaron threw his staff to the ground in front of Pharaoh, and the staff wasimmediately transformed into a living serpent. When the court magician tried toduplicate the trick, Aaron's serpent devoured all the other serpents (Exodus 7,10-12). The same magic staff was used to turn Egypt's waters into a stinking redflood, and to create plagues of slimy frogs and troublesome mosquitoesthroughout Pharaoh's kingdom.Moses's and Aaron's appearances at Pharaoh's court were indeed quitespectacular. Apart from the Bible, the Legends of the Jews tell us that Mosesand Aaron had been afraid of the meeting with Pharaoh. Suddenly, the angelGabriel had appeared to them and had led the two brothers---right through allthe guards---into the palace. Even though the guards had been severely punishedfor their laxness, the same mysterious process happened again at their nextvisit. Moses and Aaron managed to appear without mishap before the throne ofPharaoh. To be honest, they must have impressed the proud ruler of Egypt quiteconsiderably, as they 'resembled angels, their outer appearance reflected andshone like the Sun, the pupils of their eyes were like the brilliance of themorning star, their beards were like young palm fronds, and when they spoke,licking flames came from their mouths.'19 Indeed, it was a most amazingstage-managed happening.It all turned out as it was written. Moses, supported by his brother Aaron andthe magical tricks of his God, triumphed over all the Pharaoh's intrigues. Thegood Lord even let darkness fall on Egypt and mysteriously killed all thefirstborn children of the Egyptians. At last, Pharaoh gave up and let theIsraelites go. And what did they do?They constantly complained about and harangued Moses, Aaron and their new God.Why would they do this? Hadn't God performed unbelievable miracles before theireyes? Did the Israelites still not trust this magic?According to the Bible, the great trek included 600,000 people 'besidechildren.' A large number of foreigners also went with them: 'A mixed multitudealso went with them; and flocks and herds, even very much cattle' (Exodus 12,37-8). Even if the figure of 600,000 may be con-siderably exaggerated, or mayoriginate with later writers, the trek had to have been tightly organized. Sothat this huge mass of people should not wander around aimlessly, 'The Lord wentbefore them by day in a pillar of a cloud; and by night in a pillar of fire, togive them light' (Exodus 13, 21). In the meantime, the Egyptians had discoveredthey had been robbed by the Israelites, and Pharaoh sent his armies against theIsraelites. The next miracle was now due. 'And the angel of God, which wentbefore the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of thecloud went before their face, and stood behind them.' Finally, the Israelite Goddried out a strip of sea and then let the entire Egyptian armed forces with alltheir horses and chariots drown in it, 'there remained not so much as one ofthem' (Exodus 14, 28). Now, at last, the Israelites believed in their God and inhis servant Moses. This faith was, however, not to last for long.Why does nobody in our society raise the question about what kind of a God weare dealing with in this story? He favours an ethnic group that does not evenbelieve in him! The people are made pliable with magic tricks, and it does notseem to matter that the opposition defend themselves when they are robbed. Thefirstborn of the Egyptians are killed, among them thousands of innocentchildren. A peculiar column, which sometimes appears as a brightly shiningcloud, then as a frightening pillar of flame, places itself at the head of thisunbelieving procession, and an Egyptian army is drowned without one soldierhaving drawn his sword. And we should not overlook the fact that the column offire deliberately led the Egyptian army to its doom.Certainly, with God nothing is impossible, and he may do what he likes with hiscreations, but then he ought to be a model for humans and not give his'likenesses' commandments that he does not himself follow. Moreover, the wholebusiness with the plagues that came over Egypt appears to me either to befictitious or unworthy of the omnipresent creator of the universe. The Koran,the holy writ of Muslims, declares quite laconically 'If he [Allah] decides athing, he only need say: so be it---and it is so' (Sura 2, verse 117). I seethis the same way.One might assume that after all those wonders and miracles with which Goddemonstrated his power to the Egyptians as well as to the Israelites, peacewould have finally reigned and everyone would have realized who was boss. Butthis was not the case. Israel's children carry on moaning and murmuring againsttheir God (Exodus 15, 24 or 16, 2). They are not at all convinced that they aredealing with an almighty being. Even the Lord seems to realize this, so hedecides to show himself to the stubborn people:'And it came to pass, as Aaron spoke unto the whole congregation of the childrenof Israel, that they looked towards the wilderness, and, behold, the glory ofthe Lord appeared in the cloud' (Exodus 16, 10).Logically, humans and animals require water and food in the desert. The Lordprovided both. He caused springs to bubble up, and in the evening, great flocksof quails fell to the ground above the trek. And every morning, 'there lay asmall round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground.' The Israelites didnot know what this was, but Moses, instructed beforehand by God, taught themabout it. This stuff was called manna, and it was heavenly bread sent by God.The only annoying thing was that this heavenly bread went off quickly, if it wasnot processed immediately, and it melted like butter in the heat (Exodus 16,20-21). Now, what is manna?The scholarly disputes about this have lasted for centuries. Generally, it isassumed that manna was the secretion of the scale insect Coccus manniparus,which lives off the tamarisk Tamarix mannifera. The plant juices of the tamariskare rich in carbohydrates and whatever is not absorbed by the insects issecreted in the form of transparent drops that solidify into small whiteglobules in the air. These globules contain fructose and small amounts of pectin(as used for preparing jams). This substance is collected by ants and depositedin their anthills. Bedouins still use this type of manna as a substitute forhoney to this day. They call it man.Although there is some similarity between the described substance and thebiblical manna, the former seems to lack some of the characteristic features ofthe food made famous by Moses. Man contains no protein, while manna in Exodus isdescribed by Moses as 'bread' and a staple nourishment. Also, man is only foundfor a few months and in such small quantities that a people wandering in thedesert would never have been able to find enough of it. Others think that mannacorresponds to the lichen species Aspicilia esculenta (manna lichen). But thislichen thrives in tundra landscapes and Alpine meadows, and is hardly found inthe desert. Yet manna is supposed to have been a daily, freshly availablenourishment.A third solution to the manna problem was published in the journal New Scientistin the spring of 1976.20 The British authors George Sassoon and Rodney Dalelater published their research as a book.21 The solution suggested by these twoEnglishmen is so fascinating, and also convincing, that I should like to give abrief account of the story.Among the edifying and puzzling texts of the ancient Jews are not only the booksof the Torah or the midrashim, but also of the Kabbala, which are a mixture ofancient secret writings. The Kabbala has become a collective term for theesoteric teachings of Judaism. The term was derived from the Hebrew QBLH,Qabalah,('that which is received'). Part of this compendium of Jewish mysticismcan be found in the three books of the Sepher-ha-Zohar (the Book of Splendour)that is alleged to have been written down by Simon bar Jochai in the 2ndcentury. The modern versions of the Kabbala were transcribed from ancient textsby the Spanish Jew Moses Ben Shemtob de Leon (13th century). The Latin KabbalaDenudata (1644) and the English version The Kabbala Unveiled (1892) originatefrom other sources, mainly from the Aramaic Cremona Codes (1558). In the ZoharBook of the Kabbala (subdivision Hadra Zuta Odisha), about 50 pages arededicated to the ark of the covenant, which Moses had to build according toGod's instructions. The manner of giving the orders in the Zohar is more or lessidentical with the narrative in Exodus chapter 25, verses 10 ff. But then thingsbecome rather strange. In the Zohar, Moses has to build not only an ark, butalso a thing or being with the peculiar name of 'Ancient of Days.' Both the arkand the 'Ancient of Days' were placed in the tent or sacred enclosure and weretaken by the Israelites on the long trek. The setting up and dismantling ofthese objects was carried out by a specially trained priesthood: the Levites.What does the Zohar say about this 'Ancient of Days'? Here follows a short,bewildering section (from verse 51 of the Hadra Zuta Odisha):The upper skull is white. Inside it there is neither beginning nor ending. Thehollow thing for its juices is extended and intended for the flowing . . . Fromthis hollow thing for the juices of the white skull, dew falls daily into thesmall-faced thing . . . And its head is filled, and from the small-faced thingit falls onto a field of apples [or bellows]. And the entire field of applesflows with this dew. The Ancient of Days is mysterious and hidden. And thesuperior wisdom is hidden in the skull, which was found [or viewed]. And fromthat one to this one, the Ancient was never opened . . . And there is not a sonof Man who knows this thing. [It is not comprehensible to anyone] . . . Threeheads are hollow. This is in one and this above another . . . And all its hairsand its cords are hidden and smooth inside a container. And the neck cannot beseen entirely . . . There is a pathway, which flows into the parting of thehairs, from the brain . . .And the text goes on in this fashion for many pages. You get the impression of astream of child-like babble. But linguist George Sassoon was able to make senseof this muddle. Sassoon can read Aramaic and was able to find a meaning for manyof the incomprehensible terms used. What could it be, this 'Ancient of Days'with several heads, cords, dew, special brains and light sources in its belly?According to the description in the book of Zohar, this Ancient of Daysconsisted of male and female parts. These two parts could be taken apart andcleaned by the Levite priests. Peculiar. How could something divine be takenapart and put together again? George Sassoon weeded out some of the margin notesand soon noticed that this was not about a living being but about a machine.This apparatus produced something that was available fresh and daily. Could ithave been manna?This was the moment when Sassoon required the help of a biologist. Rodney Daleis a biologist and also someone who was able to translate confusing biologicalprocesses into technological terms. Finally, Martin Riches, a scientificillustrator, joined the team, and soon the Ancient of Days was revealed as abiochemical machine.The bewildering Kabbala text results in an astonishing revelation: The Ancientof Days had two skulls, one above the other; both were contained within an outerskull. The upper skull contained the upper brain, in which dew was distilled.The lower skull contained the divine oil. The Ancient had four eyes, one ofwhich shone very brightly from inside; the other three shone more faintly, fromleft to right, black, yellow and red. As is proper for an Ancient, it had avoluminous beard in 13 different variations. Many hairs grew out of its face andthen back again at the bottom of its face. These hairs were soft, and the holyoil ran through them.Then there was a 'small skull' (the small-faced one), in which fire developed onone side and air on the other. Some kind of oil flowed from the upper skull intothe lower skull and there changed colour from white to red. Something'honey-like' flowed through the 'cords,' down into a testicle. When one testiclewas full, the overflow of honey flowed into a second testicle. The left testiclewas emptied daily via the 'penis,' then cleaned; the right testicle filled upmore on a daily basis and was only emptied on the Sabbath, then cleaned thefollowing day. But what was this all about?The upper part of the Ancient of Days was simply a distilling device with acorrugated, cooling surface, over which air could pass and water was condensed.The 'cords' were conducting lines, which allowed water to flow into a containerwith a strong source of light. This light irradiated a culture ofalgae---possibly of the Chlorella type. There are dozens of Chlorella species,whose equilibrium between protein, carbohydrates and fats can be alteredaccording to its conditions for growth. The algae culture circulated within asystem of pipes that enabled an exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide with theatmosphere and allowed excess heat to escape. The Chlorella slime was conductedinto another container where it was treated in a way that partially hydrolysedthe starch into maltose, which was then lightly heated to produce the taste ofhoney wafers. Just as it is described in Exodus.And it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers madewith honey. (Exodus 16, 31)The dried product was then conducted into two vessels (the 'testicles'). One ofthese served the daily requirements, the other one filled up gradually toprovide a store for the Sabbath. The apparatus did not work during the weeklySabbath break, and was maintained so that it was ready to work again from theSunday onwards.This manna was a basic nourishment that contained protein, comparable withflour, and which could be made into different breads or flat pancake-like foodsin the hot desert sand. It was manufactured by means of a wondrous, highlytechnological device. The water collected in the form of dew during the nightwas mixed with small parts of the Chlorella algae. When this species of algae isirradiated, it can multiply at an unbelievable rate within 24 hours. The machinehad to deliver one omer per day, per family. (One omer was a Hebrew volumemeasure and was equivalent to about three litres.) At this time, there were onlyabout 600 families left to supply, so the output of the manna machine shouldhave been about 1.5 cubic metres per day. So what became of this miraculousmanna machine?The priests of the Levites were the only ones who knew how to maintain and cleanthe apparatus. Moses's brother, Aaron, was the chief of the Levites and hadreceived his instructions directly from the Lord. Once the machine was no longerbeing maintained properly, no heavenly food was dispensed. The prophet Joshuabemoans this fact: 'And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten ofthe corn of the old land' (Joshua 5, 12). After the fall of Jericho, theapparatus was stored in a place called Shiloh (1 Samuel 4, 3). Later, thePhilistines captured the manna machine together with the ark of the covenant.According to Sassoon and Dale, the ark was no less than a generator (supplyingthe energy) for the manna machine. It is a fact that the Ancient of Days and theark were always placed side by side in the holy tent (1 Samuel 6-8). It is notsurprising that, when it was not maintained correctly, the ark often causedfatal accidents, even among the trained Levite specialists (1 Samuel 5, 11-12 or2 Samuel 6, 3-7). The Philistines on the other hand, who had captured thedevices, had no idea how to work the ark and the manna machine. Many of themdied of terrible diseases because they had been too close to the technologicalmonster. Full of fear, the Philistines sent this loot back to Israel withoutmaking any demands. King Solomon (the Wise) had a special shrine built in thetemple to house the ark and the manna machine. By this time, none of thesedevices were functioning any more, and neither Solomon nor David were able toget the magic processes to work again. In the end, a son of Solomon stole partsof the machine and took them to his mother, the Queen of Sheba. This is detailedin the Book of Ethiopian Kings.22And what is the status today? The remains are alleged to lie deep in the groundunder the cathedral of Mary in the Ethiopian city of Axum.It would be easy just to smile at this reconstruction of a manna machine in theKabbala, but it is still a brilliant idea, and scientifically beautifullyillustrated. Many parts of the puzzle cannot be found in the Bible, even thoughthe 'Word of God' provides some clues that should make us think. Who hasnoticed, for example, that the transportation of the ark required two carts?Read this in 2 Samuel, chapter 6, verse 3.And they set the ark of God upon a new cart . . . and Uzzah and Ahio, the sonsof Abinadab, drove the new cart.This same Uzzah later died---'God smote him there for his error'---when hetouched the ark during transport and it was shaken by the oxen. Divinepunishment? What for? Only because he had tried to steady the ark to prevent itoverturning?There are many puzzles about the ark of the covenant, even among thetheologians. First of all, Moses had to build a curious box or casket accordingto the Lord's exact instructions (Exodus 25, 10). These instructions would nothave been only verbal as the good Lord was in possession of an original:And look that thou make them after their pattern, which was shewed thee in themount. (Exodus 25, 40)The purpose of this strange box is also disputed. Theologian Rainer Schmittthinks the ark 'is a container for a holy stone.'23 This is contradicted byfamous theologian Martin Dibelius, who thinks we are dealing with a 'portable,empty throne of God, or a wheeled vehicle of God on which stood or sat theGodhead.'24 Theologian R. Vatke saw it differently again. He maintains there was'nothing inside the ark, because God lived inside it.'25 Harry Torczyner thoughtthe tablets with the commandments were transported in the ark.26 This wasquestioned again by Martin Dibelius. There are even passages in the Bible thattell us of the ark: 'And the ark of the covenant of the Lord went before them inthe three days' journey, to search out a resting place for them' (Numbers 10,33). Did the Lord not know in advance where the Israelites ought to camp? And soon! The subject is endless. Whoever takes the trouble to dip into OttoEissfeldt's 1,000-page work on theology will soon have some inkling about thissubject.27The ark was a lethally dangerous object. This is not just something we can readabout in the Bible; the Torah scholars are also aware of this. Philosopher andmathematician Lazarus Bendavid (1762-1832), former head of a Jewish school,wrote 150 years ago: . . . the holy hut at Moses's time must have contained a fairly complete deviceincorporating electrical instruments. According to the talmudists, entering theHoly of Holies was always tantamount to being in mortal danger. The High Priestalways performed this duty with a certain degree of fear and counted himselflucky when he emerged again safely.28But what kind of God---and this is really the cardinal question in thischapter---would have his top secret servants (Moses and Aaron) build him aspecial box, for which there was already an original? What God would have themtake apart an 'Ancient of Days' and clean it? What God would have them transportan extremely dangerous apparatus that is proven to have led to several deaths?Would an omnipresent Spirit of the Universe really require such drama? One couldobject that all this was a matter of interpretation and that God was onlyinterested in getting humans to believe deeply in him. But this is exactly theproblem. Are we supposed to believe doggedly in a God surrounded bycontradictions and errors of judgement? If this were really God's purpose, everysect would have free rein to believe in their own interpretation and their ownBible. Every group is, naturally, of honest intention and convinced that theirversion of the Holy Writ, their translation, was the only true one. My ownfeelings are that it would contradict divine intelligence to allow one'screatures to believe in something they must realize cannot be so. The command'You must believe, even if you see errors' is unintelligent in the deepestsense. The path to so-called 'salvation' can surely not include holding on tomisunder-standings and nonsense. The creative spirit of the universe is, aboveall, timeless and eternal. 'It' would know that its intelligent creatures wouldstart looking for new explanations for old contradictions sometime in thefuture. If indeed 'salvation' exists within the divine principle, then it mustlie in realization. 'Believing is a comfort, thinking an effort' (LudwigMarcuse, 1894-1971).The God described in the Old Testament disposes of powers that go far beyondanything humans in those times understood. As we know from our present, atechnologically inferior group of people will perceive every advanced weapon asmagic. I wrote an earlier book about this.9 This same goes for the OldTestament. There we have a battle between the Israelites and the Amalekites.Moses sends his warriors into battle under the leadership of Joshua, while he,together with Aaron and Hur, climbs on to a nearby hill. What for?And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed, andwhen he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed. But Moses's hands were heavy; andthey took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hurstayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side;and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun. (Exodus 17, 11 ff)The Israelites won the battle, and the good Lord told Moses, he would 'utterlyput out the remembrance of Amalek under heaven'---in other words, he would wipethem out.What a situation! Lacking the evidence, we do not know what kind of weapon Mosesused from his strategic position on the hill, but it must have been somethingheavy. His closest confidants had to help hold up his arms. And their enemieswere completely wiped out. This is divine?The absolute climax of meetings between Moses and his God took place in chapters19 and 20 of Exodus. First, Moses climbs 'up to the top of the mount.' The Lordgives Moses the order to tell his people that now they had seen what he had doneto the Egyptians and how he had 'bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you untomyself. Because of this, henceforth, the people should listen only to his voiceand keep his covenant. 'Then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above allpeople: for all the earth is mine.' There seems no point in asking why thecreative spirit of the universe requires a 'possession.' As the indecisivepeople still waver, the Lord decides, 'Lo, I will come to thee in a thick cloud,that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee forever.'Finally, the Lord declares that he will come down onto Mount Sinai in front ofthe whole people, the day after next. This does not, however, appear to havebeen quite that feasible, as Moses has first to draw a boundary around themountain,And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed toyourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it;whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death; There shall not anhand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it bebeast or man, it shall not live. (Exodus19, 12)A few verses on, there are additional instructions:. . . charge the people, lest they break through unto the Lord to gaze, and manyof them perish. (Exodus 19, 21)This ban applies equally to the priests, 'lest the Lord break forth upon them.'Even if further passages were required to show that Moses was not speaking tothe omni-present spirit of the universe but to something quite different, thesesentences provide the evidence. Why can this incomparable and unique God notprotect them himself? And indeed, what from? Why does he require a barrieraround the mountain? Why the dreadful warnings of death? The Lord should haveknown that these beings created 'in his image' are curious. If, for whateverreasons, he did not wish these humans or animals to come near him, why could henot have put up a protective shield around the mountain? Was he not capable ofdoing it? Naturally, theologians see this differently. Of course, they have hadthousands of years to come up with something complicated to explain the banal.The good Lord wanted to draw a line between the profane and the holy, betweenthe ordinary and the extraordinary. The profane ought to lie outside a holyarea, and later on, outside the temple. Inside the holy area is the dwellingplace of the incompre-hensible, the secret, which humans may not approach, andwhich they would not be able to understand anyway. The holy area or enclosure,according to the Brockhaus dictionary, contains the infinitely superior, theungraspable, the otherwordly power.That is what it must be. Holy boundaries, places of awe, have existed in allcultures and religions from the most distant past to the present. But what arethe origins of this thinking? In Exodus, the Lord defines the boundaries aroundthe mountain. Would it have not been sufficient to punish those humans (andanimals) who crossed the line with a beating? Was it not possible to preventthem, by means of an insurmountable barrier, from straying into the holy area?Evidently this was not possible in Exodus. Why? Because the Lord came down uponthe mountain. And how!And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the Lord descended upon it infire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the wholemount quaked greatly . . . And the Lord came down upon the mount Sinai, on thetop of the mount . . . (Exodus 19, 18 ff)And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thundersand lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpetexceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled. (Exodus19, 16)And who would have not trembled at this demonstration? Separating off a holyarea seemed almost superfluous. Now at last, the obstinate people appeared tohave comprehended that the God of Israel disposed of mighty powers, that he wasthe true God and that Moses's word was absolute law. This insight did not lastfor long. Moses walked into the cloud 'in which was God' to receive the tencommandments from him. We have all had to learn these command-ments at some timein our R.E. lessons. They are wonderful rules for living together that would besensible in the entire universe for all intelligent forms of life. And the onlybasis for differing interpretations could be found in the first twocommandments. The Lord commands:Thou shalt have no other gods before me. (Exodus 2 20, 3)Why? Were there any other gods? Assuredly, the different peoples in that timewithout history worshipped various nature gods like the Sun, the Moon, thestars, and so on. And they also prayed to home-made idols. But gods, 'those whodescended from above' (the Hebrew elohim)?Who, apart from the God of theIsraelites, had descended? The most diverse gods worshipped by 'other peoples'are described in 2 Kings, chapter 17-21. Deuteronomy abounds with the brutaldestruction of those peoples who had worshipped 'other gods.' The God of the OldTestament books brooked no rivals. And he specifically commanded not to make anyimages of him,Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thingthat is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in thewater under the earth. (Exodus 20, 4)That means not even an image of God himself. That would have been impossibleany-way, because the people never caught sight of this jealous God.Nevertheless, they were allowed to marvel, several times, at 'the splendour ofthe Lord,' a 'something' that shone, made rushing sounds and noises, churned upthe sand and was, in addition, extremely dangerous. But the God of the OldTestament desired humans not to make an image of it. Why? Would it not haveserved the divine mysticism if humans had illustrated this mysterious thing? Didthe Lord fear that humans of the distant future might identify suchillustrations as something technological?We do not know, because, in the end, everything became a question ofinterpretation, or just a view from a different period of time. Today, thethings described in the Old Testament provide quite a clear idea of what musthave been going on. But this, too, must have been obvious to an omnipresent Godwith all his timeless understanding. One just cannot get past all this, if weconcede timelessness as an attribute of the nature of God.The descent of the splendour of the Lord is supposed to have taken place onMount Sinai, or the Jebel Musa (Moses mount). The mountain is said to havesmoked 'like a furnace.' Can such statements be verified? Should one not be ableto find carbonised or even molten rocks around the Jebel Musa? The 'whole mountquaked greatly' we are told. That should have left behind some traces. Moreover,the landing was described as dangerous, and nobody was allowed to step over theholy boundary. Would it be possible to measure this uncanny thing with moderninstruments?In principle it should be possible, but nobody bothers. Jebel Musa lies in theSinai peninsula, in present-day Egypt, and is often visited by tourists. Themountain itself resembles a dried-up, deeply fissured stone desert. An ordinaryGeiger counter will at best provide vague measurements about radioactivity. Butthen, who says the danger was of a radioactive nature? Nobody knows in what yearthe Lord is supposed to have descended upon the mountain. Theologians state thatwe know the dates of Moses, and the Old Testament chronology was clearly set.Unfortunately, this is not true. The chronology of the Old Testament is full ofcontradictions and is based on nothing but pious wishful thinking. To findevidence of inconsistencies at the mountain of Moses, one would need to know theperiod in which the events took place, then employ quite different instrumentsof measurement than simple Geiger counters. Beyond this, the scholars are noteven agreed on whether the good Lord actually 'descended' on Jebel Musa. Italianarchaeologist Dr Immanuel Anati thinks the dramatic event really happened on themountain called Har Karkom in present-day southern Israel. A different view istaken by British archaeologist Lawrence Kyle, who has identified present-dayHallat-al-Bedr in Saudi Arabia as the holy mountain. Professor Dr Kamal S.Salibi, in an exciting and expertly researched book, demonstrates that theentire Moses story could never have taken place on the Sinai peninsula at all,but occurred in Saudi Arabia.30 How, then, did one arrive at all this?Everyone knows that the Israelites crossed the Jordan several times during theirwanderings. We all think that the little Jordan river is meant. In reality,however, the Jordan is a chain of mountains in the Saudi-Arabian province ofAsir. Everyone knows that Moses liberated his people from slavery in Egypt. Inthe end, the Lord destroyed the Egyptian army. The curious thing is that neitherancient Egyptian inscriptions nor any traditions show up any trace of Israelitecaptives, not to speak of hints of an exodus or the destruction of an Egyptianarmy. Not even Greek historian Herodotus, who spent quite some time in Egypt andnoted all kinds of minutiae and every date of Egyptian history, learned anythingabout Israel, about a Hebrew tribe in Egyptian captivity, about an exodus of apeople from Egypt, let alone a 'divine' destruction of the Egyptian army. Wehave all read about the trumpets of Jericho, which brought down the walls of theancient city. Archaeologists have long known without doubt that the eventnarrated by the prophet Joshua could never have occurred in the Jericho ofpresent-day Palestine, on evidence of dating alone. Theologians who believe inthe Bible have twisted things to fit the story in the Old Testament and make itbelievable. Whenever a ruin, an inscription, a water hole, a potsherd or acrumbling scrap of fabric was found in Palestine, one was immediately ready toconvert every little detail into alleged proof for the truth of the Bible. Whatis really going on here was investigated in a critical article in Der Spiegelabout three works on Bible archaeology: 'All three volumes were full ofarchaeological pseudo-revelations.'31 Very little in the Exodus book fits theSinai peninsula but a lot, on the other hand, does fit with Saudi Arabia---eventhe names of the mountains and the tombs.One hundred and thirty kilometres south of the town of Taif (Saudi Arabia, Asirprovince) lies the Jebel Ibrahim (2,595 metres), the mountain of Abraham. Afurther 150 kilometres south of this, one comes across Solomon's originalcountry: Al Suleiman. On the summit of Jebel Shada lie the remains of an altarfrom the Stone Age with indecipherable inscriptions: Musalla Ibrahim---Abraham'splace of prayer. South-east of Abha (Asir) is the 2,100-metre Jebel Harun,Aaron's mountain. Many founding fathers and prophets of the Old Testament lieburied in the mountains of Saudi Arabia and the bordering Yemen. Up until 1950,tourists were still being taken to the tombs of Cain and Abel on the JebelHadid. The tomb of the patriarch Job lies on the middle peak of the Jebel-Heshain North Yemen, and the vault of the prophet Hud is still counted among the mostimportant Arab holy shrines. It lies north of Tarim in the Hadramaut Mountains.This is all very bewildering and would, on the face of it, not be so important,if so many generations of people had not been brainwashed into believing to thisday that the Old Testament events had taken place in Sinai and Palestine. Sothere are a number of prophets' tombs in modern Israel and Palestine, althoughthese gentlemen, even according to the Bible, could never have been buriedthere. Moses is just one example. In Deuteronomy, chapter 34, the Lord says thiswas the land that he had sworn to give Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, 'but thou shaltnot go over thither . . . and Moses the servant of the Lord died there in theland of Moab . . . but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.'So why do more than 100,000 people yearly make a pilgrimage to the tomb of Mosesin Palestine? Once, Sultan Saladin dreamed that Allah had brought the mortalremains of Moses from an unknown tomb to Palestine. This dream was sufficient toerect a shrine with a tomb to Moses. In 1265, Sultan Baibars had a mosqueerected over the tomb, and in the 15th century the Mamelukes built a splendidhostel with 400 rooms beside it. Today, the tomb of Moses is one of the greatpilgrimage places of Islam---only, Moses is not buried there. This is the stateof affairs, with the descriptions in the Old Testament contradicting hardreality. The location of Aaron's tomb is also the subject of these games ofconfusion. Jebel Harun with Aaron's tomb lies 2,100 metres up, south-east ofAbha (Saudi Arabia, near the provincial town of Asir). A second burial place canbe found on the top of a mountain called Ohod near Medina.32 A third tomb inMoseroth in present-day Israel, and Aaron's fourth resting place is on top of amountain near the Jordanian city of Petra. I visited this tomb myself many yearsago.33 According to the Bible, Aaron died on the top of Mount Hor:And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, journeyed from Kades,and came unto mount Hor. And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor,by the coast of the land of Edom, saying Aaron shall be gathered unto hispeople: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto thechildren of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah.Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor: And stripAaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar, his son: and Aaron shall begathered unto his people, and shall die there. And Moses did as the Lordcommanded: and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; andAaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down fromthe mount. And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mournedfor Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel. (Numbers 20, 22 ff)In the Legends of the Jews19there is a variation about Aaron's death. On MountHor, a cave suddenly opened up and Moses invited his brother to enter. ThenMoses said it was a silly idea to enter a dirty cave with priest's clothing andso Aaron took off his clothes. Moses imme-diately handed them to Eleazar andAaron understood that this was to be his place of death. As Aaron stood naked infront of the cave, eight items of divine clothing floated by and covered Aaron'snakedness. Everything is possible in legends. In this one, Aaron's death bedflies through the air and Aaron dies by a kiss of God. Islam sees all thisslightly differently again:Mousa and Haroun [Moses and Aaron] once found a cave from which light issuedforth. They went in and found a golden throne with the inscription: Intended forsomeone whom it fits. As Mousa thought it was too small for him, Haroun sat onit. At once, the angel of death appeared and received his soul. He was 127 yearsold.34It makes little sense to go searching for the tombs of the venerable patriarchsand biblical prophets in the Holy Land. They do exist, but the revered great menof the Bible are not inside them. Another example, symptomatic for the chaoscreated by Muslims, people who believe in the Bible and the Torah, is the tombof the legendary Abraham. His sphere of activity was the place called Mambre, 2kilometres north of the town of Hebron in present-day Israel. This hilly regionis the classical ground of all the stories about Abraham, and unbelievablethings are alleged to have occurred here thousands of years ago. According tothe Bible, Abraham had settled here with his herds and tents and had erected analtar to God. From there, he chased after the Babylonian warriors with 318 ofhis servants to liberate Lot and his family. Mambre was even the location of thememorable meeting between God and Abraham, for here it was that the Lordpromised Abraham that his descendants would be as numerous as the stars inheaven. Finally, it was in Mambre that God commanded ritual circumcision.Abraham, who at 99 years old was beyond good or evil, set the example andallowed his foreskin to be cut off---together with that of his 13-year-old son,Ishmael.They must have been exciting times, long, long ago in Mambre. One day, Abrahamwas sitting in front of his tent, when three strangers turned up. Hospitable asthe founding father was, he had a young calf slaughtered and generouslyentertained his guests with food. His son [Ishmael] did not fail to notice thatthe strangers were 'no descendants of the nature of Earth dwellers.'35 In theTestament of Abraham, an old Jewish tradition, the visitors are termed 'heavenlymen,' who came down from heaven and then went back there.Now, the Bible tells us that Abraham had bought a plot of land with a cave'opposite Mambre' for 400 Lot silver (Genesis 23, 9 ff). There he had himselfand his wife Sarah buried. His son Isaac with his wife Rebekah and his grandsonJacob with his wives Lea and Rachel should have been buried in this vault too,of course.But nothing is as simple as that. In Deuteronomy, chapter 34, the Lord says thiswas the country that he had promised Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, but he, Moses,should not go thither.Why does nobody question this nonsense? How can the Lord promise Abraham landthat his descendants would obtain in the future, if the same Abraham is alreadyin this land---Mambre---and has been for ages?And what is this business with Abraham's family vault? In the centre of the cityof Hebron today we see the huge, rectangular Haram-al-Ibrahimi Mosque, awonderful holy place for Muslims, Jews and Christians. Crypts are situated onboth sides of the middle section, beneath which Isaac's and Rebekah's graves aresaid to lie. Leaf-green cloths embroidered with Arabic script can be seenthrough the brass grids. The words tell us: 'This is the tomb of the prophetAbraham. May he rest in peace.' Four small white columns support a marblesuper-structure like a canopy, which is covered with a dark wooden plate.Underneath, 68 steep steps are said to lead down to the site of Abraham's grave.This mosque is now one of the holiest sites of Islam. But Abraham's grave isinaccessible. At the time of the crusades (11th-13th centuries) an Islamicmosque stood on this spot. What may have stood there even earlier is not known.The crusaders turned the mosque into a Christian monastery. Hebron was calledSaint Abraham's City.One day, a praying monk felt a draught coming from a corner. He pursued thesource of this draught, together with his monastic brothers. The venerablegentlemen tapped the walls and discovered a spot that sounded hollow. In theend, they removed a stone slab and uncovered a cavern. Up to this point, themonks knew only from Arabic traditions that their monastery had been built abovethe Machpela cave, Abraham's vault. They broke through the wall and found behindit a small, circular room. But there was no sign of a tomb.One of these pious searchers could not accept the bitter disappointment. Hecontinued to tap the walls and discovered a wedge-shaped stone that had beeninserted into it. The stone was pulled out with great effort, and lo and behold,an entire wall crumbled. In the flickering light of torches, the monksdiscovered bleached bones on the floor and, in a niche, 15 urns that containedrattling bones. No objects of any kind had been deposited with the burials---noinscriptions, no fabric, nothing that pointed to Abraham or his family. Hymnswere sung in praise of the Lord, and later some of the bones were sold as relicsof Abraham. 'Since that time, nobody has been inside the Machpela Cave,' statesDanish research traveller Arne Falk-Ronne, who was following Abraham's trail.36Today, it is not possible to check whether the discovery of the tomb happened inexactly that way, and whether the monks and crusaders really did find somethingthat pointed to Abraham. It is generally known that many items were transferredfrom the Holy Land into European monasteries and to the Vatican at the time ofthe Crusades. The Muslims who today guard the Mosque of Abraham refuse to enterAbraham's tomb, as Allah would punish with blindness anyone who would dare toviolate the resting place of the founding father. Orthodox Jews likewise preventany kind of archaeological research with such arguments. The time is not ripe topursue these riddles without prejudice. It might just be that the spade wouldsuddenly bring surprises to the light of day that would turn out to be veryuncomfortable. A figure such as Abraham would not have been allowed by hisdescendants to disappear quietly into some vault. He was, after all, theprogenitor, the founding father of all the generations that followed, one ofthose who had spoken with God and his servants. Accordingly, reverence for himwould have been very deep indeed. If Abraham's sons had really buried him in theMachpela Cave, this spot would have become a place of pilgrimage for allsubsequent generations. This would have been even more the case, as another fivepersons worthy of veneration were laid to rest with him, figures revered bythree world religions. Nothing of all of this is to be seen in Hebron. So wherecould Abraham have been buried then, and why is his grave unknown?Professor K. Salibi demonstrates that both Mambre as well as the Machpela Cavecan be found in the Saudi-Arabian province of Asir.30 The grove in which Abrahamsettled, 'consists of small acacias and tamarisk stands in the vicinity ofNamira and Hirban, in the hinterland of Qunfudha.' In the same hilly country,near a little place called Maqfala (mqflh), is the double cave called Machpelah(mkplh). So why did this important site never become an important place ofpilgrimage?The Israelites were beaten by the Babylonians and carried off into captivity,scattered in all directions. The Babylonians had quite different gods. They didnot know Abraham, who meant nothing to them, and they had a different religion.Abraham's descendants---David, Solomon, and so on---settled in what is nowpresent-day Israel, and no tomb of Abraham existed there. If one takes the Bibleliterally, Abraham begat (among many other children) Isaac, the same one who wasnearly sacrificed by Abraham who was following God's orders. This was preventedby the intervention of an angel. Isaac then begat his twin sons Esau and Jacob.Esau was the oldest son and the first in line to inherit. Jacob did not care andcontrived to rob his brother of his firstborn rights. When the aged Isaac becameblind, and according to tradition was ready to bless and acknowledge hisfirstborn son, his wife Rebekah and the second-born son deceived him. The oldman promptly blessed Jacob instead of Isaac (Genesis 27). It was then quiteunderstandable that Esau, who had been cheated out of his inheritance, no longerwanted anything to do with his family. A Phoenician legend tells that Esau was adirect descendant of the race of gods known as the Titans, those who had 'stillfought with the celestial powers.'37 The Bible has nothing to say about Esau'sdeath, let alone about where he was buried. Not so the pseudo-epigraphs of theOld Testament. 'Pseudo-epigraphs' is the name given to texts that are notincluded in the Bible but still belong to the group of biblical history. Amongthese is the 'testament of Judah, the fourth son of Jacob and Lea.' The text isrendered in the first person singular.38 Judah gives an account of his birth,his youth and his battles. One reads with astonishment how Judah fights with thegiant Achor who 'launched bolts to front and back of his horse.' Then, theperson narrating the story tells us that his father Jacob had lived together inpeace with Esau for 18 years. Not until then did Esau demand his inheritance,and he had risen up against Jacob with a mighty people. Esau had died during thebattle and was buried in the mountains of Seir, wherever they might be,certainly not in the Holy Land. But there, in an Arab village north of Hebron,tourists are led into the Mosque of Si'ir, under which allegedly lies the graveof Esau. It was a confusing time, and the stories about it have been taken forgranted. The Bible is only one of many sources about this prehistoric epoch. Ifthe Bible were historical, the geographical places, the neighbouring regions andthe tombs of these hero figures should be found in the right places. They arenot. Abraham, just like all the other patriarchs, is not to be found where heshould be.According to the Jewish traditions, there is supposed to have been a city calledSalem (slm) during Abraham's time. This Salem cannot, however, be identical withthe later Jerusalem, as Jerusalem was founded by Solomon---or so we believe. Wehave already heard that Abraham enjoyed God's special protection from birth andthat God 'loved him specially.' This mysterious city of Salem was ruled by aking called Melchizedek, who was not the product of an ordinary humanconception, as God himself is said to have planted his seed in Sopranima,Melchizedek's mother. (Ancient literature abounds with similar, divine in-vitroconceptions.) This same Melchi-zedek once met Abraham and 'blessed him.' It mustbe obvious that these muddling events around the time of Abraham do not fit intoany timeline.Christian theologians and many leaders of smaller religious communities stilllook upon the Bible as the Word of God. This lack of judgement is part of asystem. We humans are instructed from birth in the faith and are encouraged toreject all foreign influences. Any doubts whatsoever that were put to acommunity of a particular faith were judged to be---and still are---devilish!Pope Paul IV knew exactly what he was about in 1559---when only few people wereable to read---when he had a list of books compiled called the Index librorumprohibitorum, a list of forbidden books. This Index was revoked by Pope Paul VIin 1967, but believers to this day are not really meant to devour books thatquestion their faith. My opinion is that for those critical believers who arenot inclined to swallow everything but have the courage to raise questions, theBible alone is sufficient to make one's hair stand on end.After Moses had received the ten commandments and the whole population had beenwitness to the impressive sight of God descending upon the mountain, their lackof faith immediately got the upper hand again. The common people in the camp atthe foot of the holy mountain became impatient and started fashioning a goldencalf out of jewellery and precious metals of all kinds. Then they worshippedthis idol. It seems quite unbelievable that even Aaron, Moses's brother, who wasafter all the High Priest of the Levites, joined in this blasphemy.Understandably, Moses was 'angered' at the sight of the golden calf. He smashedthe brand new tablets featuring the commandments and, on God's command, orderedthat 3,000 people be put to death:Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate,throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man hiscompanion, and every man his neighbour. And the children of Levi did accordingto the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousandmen. (Exodus 32, 27-8)The Lord, who once again did not know how the stubborn Israelites would reactduring Moses's absence, was angry, but he still promised to lead them to thecountry where milk and honey flowed. He himself, though, did not seem to feellike travelling with them any more, 'For I will not go up in the midst of thee;for thou art a stiff-necked people: lest I consume thee in the way' (Exodus 33,3). Nevertheless, he appears to be mollified by jewellery: 'Therefore now putoff thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.' My kingdomfor a plausible explanation as to what God was going to do with the jewellery!Still, he did provide an angel as his deputy, who drove away the peoples alreadyliving in the Promised Land, 'And I will send an angel before thee; and I willdrive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Pirizzite, theHivite, and the Jebusite' (Exodus 33, 2). Cool!Before the journey could continue, Moses set up the holy tent (the tabernacle)outside the camp and called it the 'tent of the meeting.' Here, we have not justthe ark of the covenant together with the 'Ancient of Days,' but also a strangepillar of cloud placed itself at all times protectively in front of the entranceto the tent, whenever Moses and Aaron were inside. The Lord is supposed to havespoken to Moses in the tent, face to face, 'as a man speaketh unto his friend.'But wait! Exactly the opposite is written in the same chapter 33 of Exodus.While verse 11 assures us that the Lord spoke to Moses, face to face, as a manto his friend, verses 18, 19 and 20 convey a very different impression. There,Moses implores God, 'I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.' And verse 23, '. . .and when I take mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts, but my face shallnot be seen.'The same rejection is taken for granted in the Gilgamesh epic: 'Who looks uponthe gods' faces, must die.'Would humans perhaps have become infected with alien viruses or bacteria, andwere the gods unable to prevent this? Or was it the other way around? Were thegods afraid of becoming infected by humans? Was this the real reason for theholy enclosures, the temple forecourts and inner holies of holies, into whichonly priests were allowed, who had been cleansed several times and wellinstructed? God in quarantine? What kind of God? What kind of gods? In Numbers,we find that conversations between God and his servant are once more conductedin relative terms. Now God only communicates with Moses by means of a kind ofloudspeaker:And when Moses was gone into the tabernacle of the congregation to speak withhim, then he heard the voice of one speaking unto him from off the mercy seatthat was upon the ark of testimony from between the two cherubims: and he spakeinto him. (Numbers 7, 89)It really is a bit much, what is expected of the simple believer in the way ofcontra-dictions. Once again, the people murmur against their God. This time itis about the boring menu. Moses had the not-very-sensible idea of asking theLord for meat. The Lord promptly organized a strong wind, which blew a flock ofquails across from the sea and had them plunge to the ground over theIsraelites' camp. There must have been a huge number of them, as the littlebirds lay around the camp, 'as it were a day's journey on this side, and as itwere, a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp and as it were twocubits high upon the face of the earth' (Numbers 11, 31). As one would expect,the Israelites gathered up the quails, to dry them, and also to make immediatemeals of them. But 'while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it waschewed, the wrath of the Lord was kindled against the people, and the Lord smotethe people with a very great plague' (Numbers, 11, 33). Why did the Lord providehuge quantities of quails, only to punish the hungry people? Were the Israelitesperhaps intended, for some reason, only to consume food that was made of thebasic substance of manna?Time and again, the God of the Old Testament drums into his people that he had'separated' the Israelites from all other peoples (Leviticus 20, 24).Consequently, the new rules are very different and are to be strictly adheredto. Adultery is to be punishable by death, for both man and woman. The same goesfor son-in-law and mother-in-law, but even for one's own wife and her mother, ifthe husband were to 'take both to wife.' Homosexuals are also immediatelycondemned to death: 'They shall surely be put to death. Their blood shall beupon them.' These harsh directives can be found in Leviticus, chapter 20, verses10 ff. The same unmerciful attitude is to be shown to fortune-tellers: 'A manalso or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely beput to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood shall be upon them'(Leviticus 20, 27). Evidently, the same did not apply to the innumerable tellersof the future who were later called prophets. They were forever having visions,enlightenments or apparitions, without instantly being slaughtered for it.Special rules applied to priests too; today they would be regarded asdiscrimination. Anyone who was in the slightest way disabled was not allowed tobe near the altar. The same went for the blind and the lame, for those withmutilated faces, or for anyone who had 'anything superfluous.' Woe to anyone whoserved God and who had a blemish or was injured in an accident: '. . . a manthat is brokenfooted or brokenhanded; no man that hath a blemish in his eye, orbe scurvy, or scabbed, or has his stones broken' was allowed to approach theLord (Leviticus 21, 17 ff).Even a bad word against the new God, a quiet curse, was to be punished withdeath immediately by stoning (Leviticus 24, 13). If one did damage to one'sneighbour, the same should be done to him, so 'breach for breach, eye for eye,tooth for tooth.' Strangely enough, the Israelites were allowed to keep slavesin this curious form of society, expressly allowed by the Lord. Nobody asked theslaves what they thought. The Promised Land, in which milk and honey wassupposed to flow, and which had been promised to the Israelites, first had to bescouted out and then, later conquered. Moses sent his scouts into the PromisedLand and had them spy out this longed-for goal of their travels. The scouts,however, were afraid of the peoples who were already living in the PromisedLand:And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak which come of the giants: and wewere in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight. (Numbers13, 33)Naturally, the people 'murmured' again against Moses and his God---the murmuringhad no end. Two hundred and fifty Levites ganged up and said, 'Ye take too muchupon you' (Numbers 16, 3 ff). Of all people it was the Levites who rebelled, thevery team of people who had been allowed to transport the ark of the covenantand had maintained the 'Ancient of Days.' A great deal of resentment and angerseems to have built up. Moses ordered the three leaders of the group to comebefore him, and when they refused, he went to them---in order to kill them,together with their families, naturally with the help of the divine weaponstechnology:And it came to pass, as he had made on end of speaking all these words, that theground clove asunder that was under them:And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and allthe men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods. They, and all thatappertained to them, went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed uponthem: and they perished from among the congregation. (Numbers 16, 31 ff)And what happened to the remainder of the 250 sons of Levi? 'And there came afire from the Lord, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men . . .'(Numbers16, 35)So what are 250 dead compared to the innumerable tribes that the men of Mosesdestroyed---often with the help of extraordinary magic from their God? At least,this is what the Bible says. Whether things really happened that way is anothermatter. Moses's army then massacred all the males of the Midianites, and wasalso ordered to 'kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him'(Numbers 31, 17 ff). Naturally, each victory meant that enormous quantities ofloot fell into the hands of the Israelites. The priests were supposed to delivera certain part of this to the Lord as tribute. But even this was not enough, asthe Lord also demanded people: '. . . of which the Lord's tribute was thirty andtwo persons' (Numbers 32, 40).This might all sound rather terrible and incomprehensible, and of course thetheologians maintain that it was all meant symbolically. I have neverfound---anywhere---a single convincing argument for why the Lord would want lootor, even more crazily, what he needed people for. I am not just quoting a singlepassage from the Old Testament. Not at all. The Lord seems to be forever lustingafter jewellery, precious stones, precious metals, delicately woven cloths, yes,even seal skins.Now, the texts of the Pentateuch (the first five books of the Old Testament)originate from different periods of time and they definitely show up thesignatures of various different authors. All the exegetes are agreed on this. Inaddition, things have been added later on that were not originally part of thetexts. Presumably, some of the merciless laws were invented later on and addedto the five books by some fanatic. The trouble is that the scholars of the textstoday can no longer determine which parts are the original texts. This makes mewonder even more about the fact that so many theologians require believers tolook upon the texts in the Old Testament as 'God's word.' 'Without exception,they are reports of the consummation of the Word of God. This pattern isgenerally applicable.'11We know from the traditional stories about Sodom and Gomorrah that theinhabitants of the two sinful cities placed no boundaries upon their sexualdesires. Not only did they have intercourse with both sexes, but with animalstoo.30 Hence the term sodomy. This perverse habit had to be radicallyeliminated. The corresponding punishments were appropriately severe:Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith, it isconfusion . . . And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death:and ye shall slay the beast. And if a woman approacheth unto any beast, and liedown thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be putto death; their blood shall be upon them. (Leviticus 18, 23 ff and 20 15 ff)Without a doubt, the Lord of the Israelites was familiar with modern hygiene,and he passed on his knowledge to his chosen people without any restrictions:And when a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or brightspot, and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy, then heshall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests . .. And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and when thehair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight be deeper than theskin of his flesh, it is a plague of leprosy . . . If the bright spot be whitein the skin of the flesh, and in sight be not deeper than the skin, and the hairthereof be not turned white; then the priest shall shut him up him that hath theplague seven days . . . (Leviticus 13, 2 ff)This was about diagnosing diseases and, as in this case, keeping the patient inisolation. Modern-sounding instructions were given for total and carefuldisinfection. The rules of conduct left no margin for discretion:. . . every bed, whereon he lieth that hath the issue, is unclean: and everything, whereon he sitteth, shall be unclean, and whosoever toucheth his bedshall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water . . . and he that toucheththe flesh of him that hath the issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself .. . and if the issue spit upon him that is clean: then he shall wash his clothesand bathe himself in water . . . and what saddle soever he rideth upon that haththe issue shall be unclean: and he that beareth any of those things shall washhis clothes . . . and the vessel of earth, that he toucheth, shall be broken . .. (Leviticus 15, 4 ff)All these instructions regarding hygiene are dealt with in detail in Leviticus,chapters 13-16. They are perfect rules for combating disease. People withinfectious diseases are not only excluded from the community, but tents and evenentire houses become prohibited zones, if a person with a particular set ofsymptoms of disease had been in it. The plaster was to be scraped off buildings,'the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the mortar of the house' andthen carried away 'out of the city into an unclean place' (Leviticus 14, 45).The bodies of dead animals would not be touched, and even the High Priest Aaronshould on no account go into the holy tent, unless he had thoroughly bathedhimself beforehand. If Aaron did not adhere exactly to these rules forcleanliness and clothing given by the Lord, he would die, 'that he die not'(Leviticus 16, 2).Harsh but true. Nothing 'unclean' was to be allowed in the vicinity of the Lord,and certainly no smelly fellow. But the contradictions in the Old Testamentscream out. On the one hand, Moses may never see the face of his Lord, so henever did come into direct contact with him; on the other hand, bathing andclothing rules were to be strictly enforced, if anyone was to be near the Lord.In the Bible, all these hygiene rules apply only to the chosen people---only theIsraelites are taught how to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, or eventhe outbreak of an epidemic. Other peoples did not seem to enjoy suchprivileges. It should be mentioned here, however, that the gods of otherpeoples, wherever the gods were living beings rather than statues, also demandedabsolute physical cleanliness of their priests. You only entered the holy ofholies after bathing and wearing pleasant-smelling, scrupulously clean clothes.I will not discuss again, in this chapter, the fact that the Bible providesnarratives of a technological nature that can be calculated and drawn accordingto the descriptions given, and point to anything but a meta-physical God (see mybook, Wir alle sind Kinder der Götter, keyword Ezekiel).So what remains of the God of the Old Testament after this listing ofcontradictions? An aged Jesuit with whom I once conversed suggested that God hadperhaps given us a kind of thinking test. Will you find the answer? I think so,if one allows people to think freely and put two and two together. But everyreligious group tries to prevent exactly that. And I am not talking only aboutChristian groups! The concept of thinking for one's self is a horror in theminds of fanatical believers. Faith needs no proof. Faith lends security, evenif reality is all chaos. Believing is not-wanting-to-know, as researching andthinking will inevitably lead to other answers. But thoughts cannot be killedoff, just as the results of research cannot be. As long as humans exist, theywill think. This flow is eternal, and even if groups who believe that only theyare right succeed in stemming the flow, a fresh spring will always bubble upagain, and a trickle will turn into a torrent.In the Bible, God made eternal covenants with both Moses and Abraham. Historicalresearch into the present times demonstrates that none of them was upheld. Thereturn of God was prophesied several times, and a new kingdom was to begin. Theonly thing was, nothing happened. Religious zealots have prophesied a return ofthe Messiah in all manner of biblical passages. Not a single one of these quotesis correct. (Anyone who would like to read more about this should read chapter 3of my book, The Return of the Gods.)Exodus, chapter 34, demonstrates that God isa jealous god (verse 14) and that Moses should on no account make covenants withthe inhabitants of another country. Where would the world be withoutinternational agreements? The Lord promises:For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neithershall any man desire thy land. (Exodus 34, 24)Where do 'God's people' live today? Scattered across many continents, and thestate of Israel is pressured by its neighbours. Orthodox Jews, who cling toevery word of the Torah---if it serves them---expect the new kingdom to arrivesometime in the future. Tomorrow would be best. It does not seem to bother themthat this kind of spiritual attitude makes a sensible agree-ment with theirneighbours impossible.I have already pointed out that Moses never saw his Lord face to face. Butsomething seemed to have happened to Moses's face. When he came down from theholy mountain with the tablets of commandments, he 'wist not that the skin ofhis face shone while he [the Lord] talked with him' (Exodus 34, 29 ff). WasMoses suffering from the effects of radiation after his encounter with the Lord,which lasted some 40 days? Peter Krassa suspected this 30 years ago.40 If onefollows the Old Testament, something strange really seemed to have happened toMoses:And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of hisface shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him . . . and till [when] Moseshad done talking with them, he put a vail on his face. But when Moses went inbefore the Lord to speak with him, he took the vail off, until he came out . . .and the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses's faceshone: and Moses put the vail upon his face again, until he went in to speakwith him. (Exodus 34, 30 ff)Veil on, veil off. The remainder of the text no longer mentions a veil. DidMoses's face look disfigured somehow, after he had obtained his instructionsfrom the Lord on the mountain? We know as little about this as we know aboutwhether these biblical passages are genuine, or whether they have been inventedand added by later writers, as many other things were. However, the narrativesin the Bible are, 'without exception, reports of the consummation of the Word ofGod's. This pattern is universally applicable.'11If the Bible really consists entirely of 'reports of the consummation of theWord of God's' and---according to theology professor Karl Rahner---the holy writof the Old and New Testaments originated 'from the same source' and this wasplanned 'from times eternal' and for 'final salvation,' then believers wouldhave to take the paragraphs in the Book of Revelation as true. The Book ofRevelation has been added to the New Testament and is supposed to have beencompiled by John the Evangelist. There, you can read about terrible plagues,which chastising angels will pour out over the Earth---naturally only on tounbelievers. The Lord is always demanding trials and punishments. But---what asurprise---after all the terrible times a new Heaven and a new Earth will arise:And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earthwere passed away; and there was no more sea. And I John saw the holy city, newJerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven . . . and the city was pure gold,like unto clear glass . . . and I saw no temple therein . . . and the city hadno need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it . . . (Revelation 21, 1ff)I know people who believe in UFOs, who have been saying for years thatextraterrestrials would turn up soon and lead a certain percentage of humans toanother world. Scientists and politicians complain about this nonsense becauseit might lead to people giving up and blocking off the problems of our world.They are right, of course. They do not, however, appear to know where the sourceof this kind of thinking can be found: in the Book of Revelation in the Bible.So where do we stand now? Where is this God who quite willingly allows himselfto be fitted into all schools of thought? He seems not to be in the Bible or,for that matter, in any other holy or unholy text. Astrophysics has, during thelast few decades, presented several models for the creation and nature of theUniverse. All of these theories, developed by clever people with integrity,appear to contradict each other. According to Einstein's formulas, a restinguniverse cannot exist. This led physicist and astronomer George Gamow to thetheory of the Big Bang in 1948. This idea was still thought of as incontestablewhen I went to school, because it could be proved by the red shift (Dopplereffect) by Edwin Powell Hubble: the galaxies are rushing away from each other atincreasing speed. This view stood until astronomers discovered galaxies that areso far away from us, they could no longer be covered by the umbrella of existingtheories. Moreover, some of these galaxies should by now have reached a speedgreater than that of light, which would contradict Einstein's theory. Newtheories had to be created. Physicist Andre Linde of Stanford Universitydeveloped the theory of a 'bubble universe.' According to this, just like in abathtub full of mineral water, new bubbles keep on being created---new 'BigBangs.' A universe of eternally exploding and newly creating bubbles. Naturally,this is not sufficient to grasp the universe, so new dimensions were necessary,and if there were none, they had to be created mathematically. If once 25spatial dimensions were required in the complicated world of astrophysics, tohelp toss the salad, so at present, one manages with just ten. Even these 10 arenot accessible to the average citizen---they only exist in the heads andcomputers of scientists.Astrophysicist Oskar Klein came up with the 'string theory' (the universe isriddled with 'strings of energy'). These strings may exist---nobody knows forsure---but they still did not explain the structure of the universe. So,physicist Edward Witten then created the theory of the vibrating membranes. Nowthe world had the 'M-theory.' 'M' does not only stand for membrane, but also formysticism. Black holes were calculated mathematically, which contradicted oldertheories. Other astrophysicists not only puzzle about how the universe came intobeing, but whether it ever came into being. It had always been there.Incomprehensible! That is a word which does not exist in astrophysics, where theincomprehensible becomes possible. The main thing is that a new challenge tothinking is occupying the convolutions of the brain. And where did it come from,that thing that was always there? And how will it all end? Physicist PaulDavies41 has postulated a 'Big Crunch' in addition to the 'Big Bang.'Afterwards, the story of the universe begins anew. Even the ancient Indians werefamiliar with that one, and it can be read in the Vedas.What we are left with is a gigantic universe with trillions of stars andplanets, which we now know is infinite---though we do not know whether itconstantly renews itself and is born again somewhere, or whether it swallows upall its energy in the end. (This, of course, contra-dicts the law of theconservation of energy in physics.) Only one truth has emerged from all this. Wehumans on this tiny planet are like microbes compared with the universe, likemicrobes in a vast ocean.Yet we still think we are so important that we seriously believe the grandioseSpirit of Creation only made up this game in order to visit our planet in astinking, smoking, noisy and dangerous vehicle. And then, to pick out among allhumans a persistently complaining people as favourite---a favourite who forquite a long time, according to the descriptions of the Old Testament at anyrate, would not believe in this God. And then he set about producing a nasty,tragic play, killing children and entire populations, and constantly---even withregard to events in the future---judging people and heaping punishments on them.And all of this in order to get stupid humankind to acknowledge him, to believein him, and to love him. Not exactly what we know as Christian charity!Where in this model is there any room left for a 'good Lord,' a loving God? Theancient, original Power, the ultimate First Spirit, which must have existedbefore the beginning of all Being, must have been a neuter, in human languageterms: an 'IT.' IT existed before the Big Bang, before black holes and strings,before the bubble universe and before all thoughts that we are capable ofthinking. It is not possible for human understanding to grasp, to write about,or even to calculate this IT, except if, one day, this human understandingshould be extended by some older intelligence. Still, I would at least like totry and imagine a model of this IT. In discussions, I have tried this with thefollowing thought game:Imagine a computer equipped with a hundred trillion 'thought units'---'bits' intechnical jargon. Then imagine the computer had developed personalconsciousness. But this consciousness is firmly attached to the trillions ofbits. If the computer then shot itself into the universe, this personalconsciousness would be destroyed. Naturally, the brain of the computer knowsthis, because the computer knows everything. Knowing everything gets boringafter a while, no matter whether there is such a thing as time or not. So, thecomputer decides to end this boredom and to store new experiences. What for? Italready knows everything! The computer begins to number all its bits and to markthem in a particular sequence. And then it allows itself to explode. Big Bang.Trillions of bits, depending on their size, with varying speeds, shoot out intothe vastness and emptiness of the universe. The original computer consciousnesshas been dissolved, it no longer exists. But the clever self-destructor hasprogrammed the future after the explosion. All of the marked bits, with theirindividual bits of information, will eventually meet again in the centre of theexplosion. Every thought unit will take up its original place, and the personalconsciousness of the super brain will be intact again---with an importantdifference. Every bit has experienced something from the time of the explosionuntil its return. Something happened. An additional experience, which did notexist before the break-up, is now part of that personal consciousness. Theall-knowingness of the computer has been extended. Of course, this is acontradiction in terms, but---please bear with me---we are talking here about athought model.From the moment of the explosion until the moment of return, no bit knew that itwas a tiny part of a greater consciousness. If a single bit had asked itself,during the long journey, 'What is the meaning and the purpose of my super-fastjourney?' or 'Who created me?', 'Where do I come from?', there would have beenno answer; that would only be possible if entire groups of thought units hadfound each other and perhaps had an inkling that something much greater must bebehind it all. Nevertheless, every bit was the beginning and end of an act, akind of creation, multiplied by the factor of new experience. I would haveattained a great deal if this simplified thought-model were a help in gettingcloser to the phenomenon of IT. We are all part of this Original Power IT. Onlyright at the end, Teilhard de Chardin's (1881-1955) 'Omega Point,'42 will weonce more understand that we unite in ourselves the cause and result ofCreation. I think it is fairly logical that IT, a synonym for the concept ofGod, must have existed before any kind of Big Bang. These thought models are notnew; the only new feature is the up-to-date comparison with a computer. Thefascinating thing is that ancient traditions know of similar ideas. John theEvangelist describes Creation in the following way,In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.All things were made by him; and without him was not anything made that wasmade. (John 1, 1-2)We do not know from where John derived this brilliant insight. The sad thing isthat the term 'God' has been lumbered with impossible ideas for 2,000 years,ideas that are geared towards passing stories on to children and semi-savages.If the phenomenon of IT (God), however, has decided to transform into matter fora short while, then IT is itself Creation and simultaneously the product of itscreation. Just like those computer bits, we too will find ourselves again in aunification. Together with trillions of other suns and the entirety of matter,we are microscopic particles of IT, which will all find their way back to theinfinite cosmological community. All the philosophers torture themselves withthe questions 'Why?', 'Where from?', 'What for?' and yet 'Knowledge,' accordingto philosopher and theologian Professor Puccetti, 'need not necessarily be foundby the scientific route. And it is a fact, that not a single so-called religioustruth of note was ever derived in that way.'43A new millennium has begun. Where do we stand?Humankind has been broken up into five great religions and thousands of rivalsects.Genetics, astronomy and communications media have expanded our horizons to adegree never attained before. And there is no end in sight.Sooner or later we will make contact with extraterrestrial intelligences. Thespeed of light will be overcome, contradicting all the theories.How do we imagine the otherworldly? Do we want ourselves to be treated asintellectually inferior by an alien intelligence because we cannot uselight-switches on Saturdays (orthodox Jews)? Because we do not eat pork (Jews,Muslims)? Because we consider cows and fat rats to be holy (Hindus and relatedbelief systems)? Or because we tortured our God and nailed him to a cross? I amin favour of announcing the end of the concept of many gods when we take thatstep into the third millennium. I would like to add that we are all tiny partsof the mighty IT for which religions have employed the term God. From thisangle, every kind of racial discrimination would become complete humbug. We allbelong to the same thing. And those religions with their self-righteousness,wars and atrocities would have, in the end, led us to the path of enlightenment.The solution of that thinking challenge could consist of analyzing (I will becoming to this yet!) the contradictions in the Bible and other ancient texts.Finally we would see the following task quite clearly: the Old Testament God wasdefinitively not a metaphysical being as manifested in the Bible. The answer hasto lie somewhere else, possibly out there in the universe. What should we do?Should we raze the temple, blow up the churches? No, of course not!Where humans come together to praise Creation, there is a beneficial, strongsense of community. Just like being touched by the note from a tuning fork, wevibrate with a mutual presentiment of that magnificent being in space whom wecall God. Temples and churches are places for contemplation, spaces for combinedworship of the indefinable, of IT, for the grandiose Spirit of the Universe.These gathering places will remain necessary. All the rest is fairlysuperfluous."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 2: Lies Surrounding the Fátima Event[The_Gods_Were_Astronauts_split_001.html#filepos1634] \"Moral indignation is the halo of the hypocrite.\"---HELMUT QUALTINGER ON 26 June 2000, the Vatican made public the 'third secret of Fátima.'Allegedly, it contained, in a symbolic language, information on persecution ofthe Church in the 20th century and included a prediction of the assassinationattempt on the Pope. It is generally known that Pope John Paul II only narrowlyescaped death on 13 May 1981, when assassin Ali Agca fired a pistol at the HolyFather on St Peter's Square. The President of the Roman religious congregation,German Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, commented on the publication of the mysterywith the following unctuous words:The teaching of the Church distinguishes between 'public revelation' and privaterevelations.' There is not just a slight difference between them, but aconsiderable difference. The term 'public revelation' refers to acts ofrevelation by God that are intended for the whole of humankind and theexpression of which is to be found in the two-part Bible consisting of the Oldand New Testaments. 'Revelation' is the term used because God has revealedhimself, step by step, to humans, up to the point where he became human himself,in order to draw the whole world to himself and become one with it, through hisson Jesus Christ who became a man. And because God is One, the course of historyin which he has joined humankind is a single one that is applicable to all timesand attained fulfilment with the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.The authority of 'private revelations' is substantially different from that of a'public revelation' . . .He then goes on to inform us that a private revelation refers to the Faith andthe 'certainty' that God is speaking. The private revelation was intended as anaid to Faith. The measure and quality of a private revelation was a pointer toChrist himself.If the 'private revelation' should lead away from Christ . . . or should evenset itself up as a different or better order, as more important than the gospelitself, then it is certain not to have originated from the Holy Ghost which, ofcourse, leads us into the Gospel and not away from it.44What abstruse logic. If the omnipresent God makes a distinction between privateand public, then a private revelation should also come from God. Not so, saysthe deeply pious cardinal. A private revelation can only come from God 'if itleads into the Gospel.' Do I infer from this that the opposition, the Devil,also gives private revelations?Worldwide expectations about the contents of the third secret of Fátima werehigh, as in 1960 the Pope had said he was unable to publish the secret becauseit concerned 'our Faith.' Pope John Paul II declared to astonished journalistsin Fulda, in 1980, 'Due to the serious content, my predecessors in the HolyOffice preferred a diplomatic version. Moreover, it should be sufficient forevery Christian to know the following: if one were to read that oceans were toflood entire parts of the Earth, that humans would be gathered to their fathersfrom one minute to the next, in their millions, then one should really no longeryearn for a public declaration of this secret . . . Pray and ask no more. Leaveeverything else to the Holy Mother of God.'45We certainly would have expected some earth-shaking announcement after suchserious statements. And what is really in the (alleged) third secret? Nosensations, no end of the world, no oceans slopping over with millions of dead,not even anything that concerned 'our Faith.' In addition to that, the publishedtext does not even tally with reality. Here is the version released by theVatican:I write in obedience to You, my God, who instructed me, through his Excellency,the Most Reverend Bishop of Leiria, and through Your and my Most Holy Mother.After the two parts which I have already described, we saw to the left andslightly above Qur Lady, an angel holding a flaming sword in its left hand; thesword was shooting out sparks and flames, as if they were about to set the worldalight; but the flames were extinguished when they came into contact with theradiance that streamed from the right hand of Our Dear Lady: the angel, pointingto the earth with his right hand cried with a loud voice: Repentance,repentance, repentance! Then, in a mighty light that is God, we saw 'somethingthat looks like the image in a mirror of a person passing,' a bishop dressed inwhite, 'we felt he was the Holy Father.' Various other bishops, priests, men andwomen of different orders climbed a steep hill, on the top of which stood a hugecross made of rough wood, like cork oak with the bark. Before arriving there,the Holy Father went through a large city that was half destroyed, and halftrembling, with a wavering step, depressed with pain and anxiety, he prayed forthe souls of the corpses he saw on his way. When he reached the top of the hill,he fell to his knees at the foot of the cross. There he was killed by a group ofsoldiers who shot at him with firearms and arrows. In the same manner,gradually, all the bishops, priests, people of orders and various secularpeople, men and women of different classes and positions died too. Beneath thetwo arms of the cross stood two angels, each one had a crystal watering can inits hand, in which they collected the blood of the martyrs and with this bloodthey watered the souls which approached God.44This public release by the Vatican---which is, after all, the highest instanceof the Roman Catholic Church, to which an army of millions of believers belongs,and to whom this institution represents the highest instance of truth---can atbest be half the truth, or half an untruth. Either the earlier popes lied whenthey made statements about the third secret of Fátima, or the reverend CardinalRatzinger is lying now. In addition, the version released by the Vatican tellsnothing about what happened in the past or in the present---not even theassassination attempt on the Pope. Instead, it speaks of a 'large city that washalf destroyed,' in which the Holy Father, together with many others, is shotdead. I am very sorry, Your Excellencies, but on 13 May 1981, when the Pope wasshot at, Rome was neither 'half destroyed,' nor did any shots hit any otherpeople. And how does the President of the Roman congregation of believersinterpret these contradictions?According to Cardinal Ratzinger, this is about the keyword of the previoussecrets, 'salvare le anime' (saving the souls). This is expressed in the words'Penitenza, Penitenza, Penitenza'(Repentance, repentance, repentance). Thisreminds one of the beginning of the Gospel of Mark: 'Repent and believe in theGospel.' The angel with the flaming sword represents the rules of the court.Human beings themselves had created and installed the flaming sword with theirinventions. The whole show seen by the children of Fátima in a vision did notrepresent an 'unalterable future,' not a film showing the future as fixed, but aplan of how this (possible) future 'could be turned into something positive.'But how? Through repentance and understanding, of course. Cardinal Ratzinger:'This is why fatalistic interpretations of the secret completely miss the point,for example by saying that the assassin of the 13th of May, 1981, had been atool employed by Fate for a divine plan, and he could, therefore, never havebeen able to act with free will . . .'I should like to inquire humbly here, what had the assassin of 13 May 1981 to dowith a 'half destroyed city'? Or with a 'group of soldiers'? And with the murderof many other people beside the Pope?The higher up the theologians are situated in the Church hierarchy, the morebewildering their way of thinking appears to be. Cardinal Ratzinger twists thevision of the future announced in the secret into a vague picture of the past.His commentary runs as follows:The Pope is walking in front of the others, trembling and suffering because ofthe horrors surrounding him. Not only are the houses in this city partly inruins, but his path leads past corpses of those killed. The path of the Churchis described as a path to the cross . . . One should see the history of anentire century represented by this picture . . . In the vision, we should seethe century ending now as a century of martyrs . . . a century of world wars andmany localised wars . . . The figure of the Pope played a special role in allthis. His weary climbing of the hill should stand for a group of several popes .. . In the vision, the Pope is also murdered on this road of martyrs. Should notthe Pope, after looking at the text of the third secret after the assassinationattempt of the 13th of May, 1981, have recognised his own fortune in this? Hehad been very close to death and had described his survival with the followingwords, '. . . it was a motherly hand that directed the flight-path of thebullet, and allowed the Pope who was fighting for his life, to stand still onthe threshold of death' (statement by the Pope on the 13th of May, 1994). Thefact that a 'mano materna' (motherly hand) had, in the end, diverted the bullet,only shows once again that there is no unalterable fate, that faith and prayerare real powers that can interfere with history, and that, in the end, prayer isstronger than the patrons, faith is mightier than divisions.What is presented here to the public really is a bit much. The 'half destroyedcity' is twisted and placed in the past century; the priests and members oforders not murdered at the time of the assassination attempt are transformedinto martyrs of the past; the 'flaming sword' is compared with human inventions;and finally, the bullet, which did not kill the Pope, has been diverted byMother Mary. Moreover, according to this commentary, the Pope had read the thirdsecret of Fátima after the assassination attempt of 1981, whereas he had, inreality, already made a public statement about it in 1980.How does such an attitude of mind come about? The Mother of God in person issupposed to have appeared in visions to the children of Fátima. Which Mother ofGod? What really happened in Fátima in 1917? And how did these messages---orsecrets---come together? What could the first and second secrets tell us, if thethird one has been falsified?Some might say that all of this originates in the imagination; it is anillusion. Others may argue that it represents a falsification of Church historyfor some 1,900 years. But let us proceed in the proper sequence.I hope I made it clear in the first chapter that the Holy Writ of the OldTestament is a collection of contradictions unworthy of a metaphysical divinebeing, and which was created at different times and compiled by various authors.Christianity is based on the Old Testament and the New Testament. Remember, thetexts of the Old and New Testaments are supposed to be derived from the samesource. According to theology, God had made a special covenant with the peopleof Israel, which had been planned from time immemorial as the prologue toChrist's appearance.11 Correspondingly, the New Testament is the continuation ofthe Old Testament. So who actually compiled the New Testament? Who wrote it? Thegood Lord?Readers who are familiar with my work will, I hope, excuse me if I quote fromone of my earlier books: We are dealing here with the beginnings of theunbelievable story about Fátima.39Every believing Christian is convinced that the Bible is and contains the Wordof God. As for the gospels, there is a general belief that the followers ofJesus of Nazareth wrote down, so to speak, the speeches, rules for life andprophecies he made. One is of the opinion that the evangelists had experiencedthe wanderings and miracles of their Master and had noted them down in achronicle not long afterwards. This 'chronicle' was given a name: 'the originaltexts.'In fact---and every theologian with a few years of higher education knowsthis---nothing about this is true. Those much-consulted original texts, soproductive in theological sophistry, do not really exist. So what do we have? Wehave transcripts, copies that were all, without exception, created between the4th and 10th centuries AD. And these copies, of which there are approxi-mately1,500, are in turn copies of copies, and not a single copy corresponds withanother. More than 80,000 (eighty thousand!) variations have been counted. Thereis not a single page of these alleged 'original texts' that does not come upwith contradictions. The verses were drafted differently, from one copy to thenext, according to the feelings of the copyists and appropriately adapted to therequirements of their times. These biblical 'original texts' are teeming withthousands upon thousands of easily detectable mistakes. The most well-known'original text,' the Codex Sinaiticus (whichoriginated in the 4th century, justlike the Codex Vaticanus),was discovered in a monastery in 1844. It contains noless than 16,000 (sixteen thousand!) corrections, which go back to at leastseven authors of the corrections. Some passages were changed several times andreplaced by a new passage of 'original text.' Professor Dr Friedrich Delitsch, afirst-class expert, has discovered 3,000 copy errors alone in the 'originaltext.'46 This is all under-standable, if one considers that none of theevangelists was a contemporary of Jesus, and no contemporary ever compiled aneye-witness account. It was not until after the destruction of Jerusalem byRoman Emperor Titus (AD 39-81) in AD 70, that anyone began to compile textsabout Jesus and his team. The evangelist Mark, of the first gospel of the NewTestament, must have written his version at the very earliest 40 years after hismaster's death on the cross. Even the church fathers of the first centuries ADwere at least agreed on the fact that the 'original texts' were forgeries. Theyquite openly speak of 'inserting, violating, destroying, improving, spoiling,extinguishing.' But that is all a long time ago, and all the quibbling reallydoes not alter the objective facts of the case. Specialist Dr Robert Kehl, fromZurich, has commented:It occurred often enough that the same passage was corrected or corrected backto the opposite meaning by one correcting copyist or the other, all depending onwhich dogmatic version was being represented by the school in question. Theseindividual corrections, but even more the planned corrections, have created atotal textual chaos that can no longer be disentangled.47Theseare the facts that one dare not admit to the believers. What did Fátimahave to do with all of this? The Mother of God, Jesus's mother, is supposed tohave appeared in Fátima. It was she whoappeared to the children of Fátima, shewho gave her message---the three secrets---to the children. How did Christianitycome to have a Mother of God? It all began with the councils. In AD 325, EmperorConstantine (c. 274-337) called the first council of the early Christian worldin Nicaea. The manner in which Constantine chose the 318 bishops who were toattend had nothing to do with religion. It was pure power politics. The emperorhimself (who was not a baptized Christian at the time; he received baptism onhis deathbed!) personally presided over the council. In true imperial style, helet it be known that his will was Church law. The top shepherds even acceptedthis unbaptized man as the 'universal bishop,' who naturally took part in allvoting. Constantine actually had not a clue about the teachings of Jesus. He wasa follower of the Sun cult of Mithras (an ancient Persian god of light). He wasdepicted on coins and worshipped as the 'Sol invictus'(the Unconquerable Sun)way into Christian times. When he gave his name to the old Greek trading portByzantium, and made Constantinople---present-day Istanbul---the capital of theRoman Empire, with no trace of Christian humility, he had a huge pillar erectedto himself, for the dedication. On top of the pillar was a statue of the emperoras the Unconquerable Sun. Constantine by no means abolished slavery, and evendecreed that slaves who were caught stealing food should have molten lead pouredinto their mouths. He even allowed parents to sell their children in times ofneed.And which decisions of Church policy did he become involved with? Up until theCouncil of Nicaea, the opinion of Arius of Alexandria was generally accepted:God and Christ were not identical in nature, but only similar. Constantineforced the council to decide in favour of the identical nature of God the Fatherand Jesus. This became Church dogma (doctrine of faith) by supreme imperialdecree. This is how we got the idea that Jesus was identical with God. Based onthis, the bishops then passed the Nicaean Creed through election by acclamation.Constantine, the non-Christian, performed another enormous service to theChurch. Up to that time, the burial site of Jesus was unknown. In 326, theemperor discovered the tomb of Jesus (who had just been acclaimed as God-like)by 'divine inspiration.'Four years later, he had the Church of the Holy Sepulchre built in Jerusalem.This wondrous discovery did not, however, prevent the emperor from having someof his closest relatives murdered in the same year, among them his son Crispus,his wife Fausta---whom he had dipped in boiling water---and his father-in-lawMaximilian, whom he forced to commit suicide. This is what the emperor andPontifex was like, the one who managed the Nicaean Creed and then declared tothe Christian communities in a circular that the votes of the 318 bishops were'God's judgement.' Constantine, who was also given the epithet 'the Great,' wasfinally elevated to sainthood by the Armenian, Greek and Russian Churches.The second council took place in Constantinople in 381 and was called by EmperorTheodosius I (347-395). He too was decorated by the Church with the epithet 'theGreat.' This Roman Imperator was not lacking in the same moral qualities as hiscolleague Constantine. He was, as history proves, a real old slave driver whoimposed unbearable burdens on the poor. Those who would not comply weretortured. In 390, just 10 years after the council, he had 7,000 rebelliouscitizens killed in a terrible bloodbath in the circus of the city ofThessalonike (Saloniki). This Emperor Theodosius declared the Christian teachingto be the state religion (hence 'the Great'!). He ordered his Bishop Ambrosiusof Milan to have all pagan shrines and temples destroyed, and whoever refused tobe baptized was slaughtered.And what happened at the second Council of Constantinople? The gathering decidedon the teaching of the Trinity of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Thisbecame the Nicaean-Constantinopolitan Creed. And here's a titbit for theologicalgourmets---the idea of the identical nature of God and Jesus, determined inNicaea, now became the identical nature of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. TheChurch is still nurtured by the Trinity to this day.The next council took place in Ephesus, in 431, and was called jointly by theEast Roman Emperor Theodosius II (409-450) and the West Roman EmperorValentianus III (425-455). These two emperors did not bother themselves withworldly or spiritual problems, as they were both playboys. Consequently, theyrarely graced the council with their presence.Theodosius II was a weakling who was completely under the thumb of his older,power-crazy, scheming shrew of a sister, Pulcheria. She was, for a time, herbrother's regent and boasted, on every suitable and unsuitable occasion, abouther virginity (which her contemporaries merely smiled about). His colleague, theWest Roman Emperor Valentianus, was under the guardianship of his mother, GallaPlacidia, which ended in murder. Not exactly models of Christian behaviour.So, what did the Council of Ephesus decide? It decided on the Worship of Mary asthe Mother of God. She was given the title 'Bearer of God.' This was not due toinspiration from a spirit; it was a politically motivated act. The reason?Ephesus was the centre of the worship of the Mother Goddess Artemis. Thedecision was intended to deflect existing mother goddesses from other religionsand unite their worship in that of the Christian religion. Immediately after thedeclaration by the council, statues of Artemis were fitted with haloes and theirnames were changed to 'Mother of God' and 'Bearer of God.' Most of the otherreligions, which were older than Christianity, were already familiar with'mother goddesses' who had, naturally, all not con-ceived in the normal way.Some god or the other was always involved. For this reason, a virginal birth wasalso inevitable for Mary. She was supposed to have conceived through an angelcalled Gabri-El; Gabri-El simply means 'man of God.'And where did the name Mary come from? The older sister of Moses, the woman whohad pointed out the floating basket containing the baby to Pharaoh's daughter,was called Mirjam (Mary). Even the Koran, the holy book of Muslims, which waswritten about 600 years after the birth of Christ, reports the virginal birth byMary:Consider also in the Book [the Koran] the story of Mary. When she once retreatedfrom her family to a place in the east, and covered herself with a veil, we sentour spirit [the angel Gabriel] in the form of a well-built man. She said, 'I amafraid of you and seek refuge from you with the Merciful One. If you fear himtoo, do not approach me.' He answered, 'I have been sent by your Lord, to giveyou a holy son.' But she answered, 'How can I have a son when no man has knownme, and I am not a whore?' He answered, 'It will still be so; for your Lord hasspoken, \"This is easy for me. We will make him [the son] a wondrous sign forhumankind, and he will be a proof of our mercy.\" So the matter is firmlydecided.' (190 Sura, 17 ff)48A few verses on, we find, 'She then came to her people with the child in herarms, and they said, 'O Mary [Mirjam], you have done a strange thing! O sisterof Aaron, your father was truly no bad man and your mother was no whore.'The virginal birth is confirmed in the 66th Sura, verse 12, 'Mary [Mirjam] too,the daughter of Amran [was an example to them]. She preserved her chastity andwe breathed our spirit into her . . .'The Koran was announced in the Arabic language from around 610 to 632, the yearthat is often cited as that of the prophet Mohammed's death. According toIslamic history, the prophet Mohammed received revelations from Allah during thecourse of a total of 23 years. Allah is the Arabic name of the one God. In theKoran, as Mohammed emphasizes, Allah confirms his Word, which he sent earlier.This means that the third Sura emphatically recognizes the Jewish Torah and theChristian gospels as prophets' words. The only major difference is now that theKoran represents the most up-to-date revelation of God and, therefore, theearlier prophets' words have been at least partly overtaken:We believe in Allah and in what he sent us, and in what he revealed to Abraham,Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and the tribes, and in what the Lord revealed to Moses,Jesus and the other prophets; we make no difference between any of these. We areMuslims [subjects of Allah]. Whosoever seeks a religion other than Islam---mayhe never adhere to it---for he shall surely be numbered among the lost in thefuture life. (3rd Sura, 84-85)According to the Mohammedan concept, Islam is the one and only right religion,because Mohammed was the last---or newest---prophet to receive God's word.Catholic theologians see this in exactly the opposite way. Because Islamconsiders it is the only true religion, the Koran demands of its believers, 'Donot strike up friendship with those who are not of your religion' (3rd Sura,117). In the Koran, Mary conceived as a virgin, but never managed to get toHeaven. And Jesus is a prophet, but on no account God's son:It is unseemly for Allah to have had a son. (19thSura, 35)The name Mary (Mirjam, Maya) appears again at the birth of the Buddha. TheBuddha was born of a virginal queen called Maya. The only thing is that thisevent took place centuries before the creation of Christianity.Mary was not only elevated through the councils, but even more emphatically bythe later popes. In 1854, Pope Pius IX announced that the Mother of Jesus hadconceived Jesus 'immaculately,' and free of the Church's 'original sin.' In1950, Pius XII topped this. He elevated the Ascension of Mary to a dogma (aprerequisite article of faith). The Mother of Jesus, according to the dogma, hadascended into Heaven 'body and soul.' In a frontal opposition to Islam, on 18November 1965 the Catholic Church announced, formally and highly officially, inthe 'dogmatic constitution': * That God was the source of the Bible, * That the Bible was holy, in all its parts, * That the Bible had been compiled in all its parts under the influence of the Holy Ghost, * That everything declared by the inspired compilers of the Bible had to be considered as written by the Holy Ghost, and * That the Bible teaches with certainty, faithfully and without error.Three years later, in the solemn credo of Pope Paul VI on 30 June 1968, thefollowing was explicitly emphasized: * the Catholic Church was the only true Church, * the Catholic Church alone proclaimed the infallible truth, * the Catholic Church was necessary for salvation, * the full treasury of heavenly riches had been entrusted to the Catholic Church, * the Catholic Church alone was the true inheritor of divine promise, * the Catholic Church alone was in possession of the Spirit of Christ, * the Catholic Church alone had been entrusted with the infallible chair of teaching, * the Catholic Church alone was in possession of the full and entire truth.This solemn credo of Pope Paul VI was issued 33 years ago. Since then, thedignitaries of the Church have spoken innumerable times with the renegades fromother churches, and the ecumenical movement was, and is, in. The followerseverywhere are led to believe that the churches are stretching out their handsto each other and finally giving up on their unspeakable self-righteousness.Don't you believe it! In the autumn of 2000, the Catholic Church again declareditself to be unique and superior to all other churches. German newspaper DieWelt wrote:The Catholic Church, in a recently published declaration, has described itselfas the only true Church of Christ and thereby contradicted equality amongdifferent directions of faith. In the declaration Dominus Jesus (Jesus the Lord)compiled by the Catholic congregation of faith under the leadership of CardinalJoseph Ratzinger, it is stressed that there is only one Church of Christ, theCatholic Church, and that it is led by the Pope, the successor of Holy St Peter,and by the bishops.49Logically, the Council of Evangelical Churches of Germany (EKD) reacted badly tothis stubborn one-sidedness by Rome. The chairman of the EKD described thedeclaration as a 'setback for the ecumenical movement' and added that 'thesignals from Rome have stagnated.' This did not in the least hinder the chairmanof the German Bishops Conferences, the Catholic Karl Lehmann, from now quiteopenly and publicly insisting that there was only one true Church---namely, 'theholy, Catholic and apostolic' one.Non-Catholics or non-Christians may say to themselves, what on Earth has this todo with the third secret of Fátima? What does it matter, what do we care aboutthis theological self-righteousness within the Christian communities? Well, tobe honest, it need not interest anybody, but it does affect the whole ofhumankind, because if one religion vaingloriously sets itself above all others,it does concern those other religions too. And this, in turn, concerns all humanbeings because the individual is part of his/her state system, and this isenmeshed with the ruling religion. Religions exercise power. And Fátima standsand falls with the Catholic religion and their Mother of God, because if thereligion is false, then no Mother of God can appear and announce anearth-shaking secret. The imagined concepts that seem to exist in the brains ofthe current teachers in the Vatican can only either make you shudder or shakeyour head and move on. Cardinal Ratzinger actually said that Christ was theMessiah of Israel and that the Jews should recognize Jesus (and therewith theCatholic religion as the only true one).50Whom should the beleaguered believer now trust? Catholic Christians all over theworld are duty-bound to believe in Mary as the 'immaculate' conception, whoascended into Heaven and is the Mother of God. She is, so to speak, the heavenlydeputy of her divine son, Jesus. And this most high, female person in Heavenappeared to the children of Fátima in order to transmit secret messages to them.Upon my soul! But then, nothing is impossible in Heaven. What really happened inFátima? On the 13th of every month from May to October 1917, three shepherd'schildren in Fátima (in the province of Estremadura, Portugal) experiencedvisions of Mary. The 'Mother of God of the Rosary'51 appeared to them as a womandressed in white with a wreath of stars around her head. The children spoke ofthese visions vividly and with enthusiasm. During the summer and autumn of 1917,they were the most important events, even far beyond Portugal. Now, visions ofMary had occurred before all over the world, but those of Fátima were differentfrom all the others. The Mother of God commanded the children to come back tothe same place every month, on the same day, at the same time. They did this,and more and more people accompanied the children out on to the field. The otherpeople present did not experience any visions, but they were able to watch thethree children suddenly sink to their knees, see their faces become transfiguredand how they evidently were talking with someone 'up there.'We should, therefore, not be surprised to hear that a huge procession of about70,000 people went on a pilgrimage out to the field on 13 October 1917, as theMother of God had announced a miracle. That day, it rained intorrents---miserable conditions for something miraculous. But suddenly, theclouds opened up, a patch of blue sky appeared and the 'Sun miracle of Fátima'began.52, 53The Sun began to tremble and to sway. It made abrupt movements to the left andright, and finally began spinning about itself like a gigantic fiery wheel atgreat speed. Green, red, blue and violet cascades of colour shot out of thecelestial body and bathed the landscape in an unreal, even an unearthly light,it was said. Seventy thousand people, among them journalists, witnessed thisevent and afterwards confirmed that the Sun had stood still for some minutes, asif it had wanted to allow the people a pause for rest. Then the fantasticfireworks began again. It was indescribable, according to the witnesses. After asecond pause for rest, the Sun dance began again for a third time with the samesplendid appearance. In total, the miracle of the Sun lasted about 12 minutesand was observed within a circle of about 40 kilometres.Today, the glass-makers in the Basilica at Fátima still depict this miracle ofthe Sun in glass. In spite of initial state measures to suppress the idea,Fátima became the goal for innumerable pilgrimages. To this day, it belongsamong the most important places of pilgrimage in the world. On the first andlast days of the visions, on 13 May and 13 October every year, Fátima resemblesa gigantic garden of expectation. Thousands hope for a vision, for a miracle;what would please them most would be to see the miracle of the Sun again. Thisis true even of the popes, who have often travelled to Fátima. Never on any oldday, but always on the 13th of a month.Three children---Jacinta Martos, Francisco and Lucia Santos---had these visions'of the Dear Lady of Fátima' and simultaneously received her words, seeminglytelepathically in their brains. The boy, Francisco, died on 4 April 1919, whenhe was just 11 years old. Miracles still happen in his name in Fátima. The girlJacinta too died young; only Lucia survived. She entered the monastery conventof Saint Theresa of Coimbra, and is now 94 years old. If one can believe theversions of the Church, the nun Lucia did not write down the second secret ofFátima until 13 June 1929, and only revealed the third one on 31 August1941---24 years after the command of the Mother of God. Why so late?The children are supposed to have seen Hell's fires in the first secret. 'OurLady showed us a giant sea of fire, which appeared to be deep in the earth. Wesaw the Devil and the souls immersed in this fire, as if they were transparent,black or brown glowing coals in the shape of humans . . .'This declaration by the seer children is diametrically opposed to a declarationby Pope John Paul II. In July 1999, he clearly explained what we should expectof Paradise and of Hell. This was published in the mouthpiece of the JesuitOrder, Civilta Cattolica.54Paradise, declared the Holy Father, was not a placeabove the clouds where angels play harps, but a state of being that occurs afterdeath. On St Peter's Square, the aged pontifex explained to pilgrims thatParadise was a living, personal relationship with the Holy Trinity. It was a'blessed community of those who had remained loyal to Jesus Christ during theirlifetime.' After clearing this one up, the Pope logically had to state aposition with respect to Hell. It was not 'a realm in which the souls of thedamned fry in eternal fires and are tortured in other ways.' No, according toJohn Paul II, Hell is a 'state of being, in which those end up who haveconstantly rejected God and have consciously done evil.' These individuals weredoomed never to attain the joy of being in the presence of God.How could the children of Fátima have looked into Hell which, according to thepapal declaration, does not exist?In the second secret, the lady with the crown of stars announced that a greatkingdom would be destroyed if one did not finally acknowledge it worldwide andworship it, and if human beings did not finally give up their erroneousteachings. The popes---or some cardinals, nothing seems certain aboutthis---turned this 'great kingdom' into Russia, even though the original text ofthe seer Lucia never mentions the word 'Russia' anywhere. Pope Pius XII spoke ofa kingdom in which, in ancient times, the 'revered icon' was worshipped. Now weknow that icons are not only revered in Russia, but were worshipped during thefirst few centuries of the Christian Church. These interpretations seemembarrassingly reminiscent of the oracle of Delphi in ancient Greece. There, thefilthy rich ruler Croesus asked the oracle whether he should engage in battlewith the Persians or not. The Pythia of Delphi answered that if he crossed theriver Halys, he would destroy a great kingdom. In 546 BC King Croesus blithelycrossed the Halys with his troops, expecting victory, and was thoroughly beatenby the Persians. The 'great kingdom' he destroyed was his own.In the second secret of Fátima, there was a further announcement that under thepontificate of Pope Pius XII a new, terrible world war would begin: 'If you seea night illuminated by an unknown light, then you will know that this is thegreat sign given you by God, that he will punish the world for its misdeeds bywar, starvation, persecutions of the Church and of the Holy Father.'I am now 66 years old and cannot remember that any night was 'illuminated by anunknown light,' nor do I remember that the dreadful Second World War representedsome kind of judgement or punishment that destroyed the godless. Russia (thenthe Soviet Union) belonged among the victorious powers, and Germany was ruined.Innumerable Catholic churches were destroyed too.Now the third secret of Fátima is at hand and the dance of the veils begins oncemore. The nun Lucia is supposed to have written down the secret on 31 August1941 and added to it on 8 December 1941. But then, Lucia is not supposed to havewritten down her notes in neat copy until 3 January 1944, at 'the instructionsof His Excellency, the most reverend Bishop of Leiria, and the Holy Mother.' Thebishop sealed the envelope containing the secret and kept it in his safe for 13years. Not until 4 April 1957 did he hand over the sealed envelope to the secretarchive of the Holy Office in Rome. The gracious bishop generously informedSister Lucia of this fact.It is unbelievable! Here we have a child who receives a mysterious but veryimportant message from the Mother of God, the Queen of Heaven and highestrepresentative of the Roman Church, in 1917. The child, who has meanwhile becomea nun in a convent, does not write down any notes until 24 years later, andthree years after that, these notes, 'on the instructions of the bishop . . .And the Most Holy Mother' are written down neatly on paper. In spite of theexplosive nature of the contents of this piece of writing, the bishop retainsthe papers for fully 13 years in his possession, before finally transferringthem to the Holy Office in Rome. And what do the gentlemen of that secret circledo with it?On 1 August 1959---a year and a half later!---the secret is passed on to the topman in the Church, Pope John XXIII, and this is all with the agreement of the'Most Reverend Cardinal Alfredo Ottavani and the Commissioner for the HolyOffice, Father Pierre Paul Philippe O.P.' Who is really the boss in the Vatican?The Pope or some priests in the Holy Office? And why is 'agreement' required tohand over such an important document to the top man in the Church? And why in1959?Because, we are told, the 'Dear Lady of Fátima' had demanded that the secret berevealed to all humankind on 17 October 1960, 43 years after the apparition atFátima. This is what Sister Lucia herself had written on the outside of thesealed envelope with the third secret. There, she had written that either thePatriarch of Lisbon or the Bishop of Leiria should open the envelope. Later,Sister Lucia said that it was not the lady who set the date in 1960, but sheherself, 'because I felt that one would not understand the message before 1960.'If this is true, a simple nun in a convent would have been the one who made thedecision when a terribly important message, conveyed personally by the Queen ofHeaven, was to be passed on to her earthly representatives. And what then dothese earthly representatives do with this unique message? Pope John XXIII toldthe gentlemen of the Holy Office, 'Let's wait. I will pray. I will let you knowwhat I decide.'55And then Pope John XXIII decided to seal the envelope again, to give it back tothe Holy Office, and not to reveal the secret to the world. The head priest ofthe Roman Church thinks he is cleverer and wiser than his own Mother of God, whomust have known why she chose the seer-children to participate in her vision.The next Pope, Paul VI, read the secret together with the Substitute, hisExcellency Monsignore Angelo Dell'Acqua, on 27 March 1965---and decided again togive the envelope back to the Holy Office, with the advice not to publish thetext. This is quite extraordinary! If the secret had been as simple as is nowmaintained, and in the form that it was finally published, there would not havebeen the slightest reason for Popes John XXIII and Paul VI not to release thetext. The version I gave at the beginning of this chapter allegedly speaks ofthe martyrdom of the Church and the Pope in the century just passed. This isaccording to the explanation given by Cardinal Ratzinger. What would havehindered the popes from making public a story that referred to the past?It is not known when John Paul II---the present Pope---first read the thirdsecret of Fátima. It must have been before 1980, otherwise he could not havespoken about it during his visit to Fulda in the same year. John Paul II askedto see the sealed envelope a second (or third?) time after the assassinationattempt of 13 May 1981. On 18 July 1981, His Eminence, the Cardinal Prefect ofthe Congregation, Franjo Seper, handed over two envelopes to His ExcellencyMonsignore Eduardo Martinez Somalo: one white envelope that contained theoriginal Portuguese text by Sister Lucia and an orange-coloured one, in whichwas the Italian translation. The Pope opened the explosive envelopes and thengave them back to the Holy Office (via Martinez).56Once more, there was no publication to the world. The assassination attempt onthe Pope had taken place two months before; the Holy Father had survived and wasrecuperating in his chambers in the Vatican. What conclusive reasons could hehave given now, not to reveal the secret? If one believes the revelation,everything had already happened that was foreseen in the secret. But it was notuntil the year 2000 that the Pope decided the secret ought to be revealed to theworld. Why, if the contents were so harmless, was it necessary finally topublish the secret?Because the whole story does not stick. As early as 1983, German news magazineDer Spiegel wrote:There is proof in books that have yellowed with age that it was not humankindbut the Vatican who had to be afraid of the publication of the secret.57The popes decidedly helped to make a phenomenal place of pilgrimage out of theformer little village of Fátima. In the middle of the Second World War, on 17October 1942, Pope Pius XII had dedicated Fátima to the Immaculate Heart ofMary. On 13 May 1982, Pope John Paul II visited Fátima and celebrated mass infront of 100,000 believers, during which the Holy Mother of God, the ImmaculateConception, was worshipped with great fervour. On 19 April 2000, Pope John PaulII wrote the following letter to the aged nun Lucia in the Convent of Coimbra:On the joyous occasion of these days of the celebration of Easter, I greet youwith the blessing that the Resurrected One bestowed upon his disciples, 'Peacebe with you!' I am looking forward to meeting you on the yearned for day of thebeatification of Francisco and Jacinta, which, God willing, will take place onnext 13th of May. As there will be no time on that day for a conversation, butonly for a brief greeting, I have instructed His Excellency Monsignore TarcisioBertone, the Secretary for the Congregation for the Teaching of the Faith, tovisit you and speak to you. This Congregation works together closely with thePope to protect the true Catholic Faith, and as you will know, has since 1957,preserved your hand-written letter which contains the third part of the secretrevealed on the 13th of July, 1917, in the Cova da Iria, Fátima. MonsignoreBertone, who will be accompanied by His Excellency Monsignore Serafim de SousaFerreira e Silva, the Bishop of Leiria, will come to you in my name, to ask yousome questions regarding the interpretation of the 'third secret.' ReverendSister Maria Lucia, please speak openly and honestly with Monsignore Bertone whowill personally inform me of your answers.I pray most profoundly to the Mother of the Resurrected One for you, for theCommunity of Coimbra and for the entire Church. May Mary, the Mother ofHumankind on the pilgrim's path, always hold us close to Jesus, her beloved son,our brother, the Lord of Life and Splendour.With a special apostolic blessing,John Paul II.Eighty-three years have passed since the secrets were revealed to the childrenof Fátima. Pope John Paul II has known the third secret for at least 18 years,yet not until the year 2000 does the Holy Father send a high-ranking emissary tothe convent of Coimbra in order to pose 'a few questions regarding theinterpretation of the third secret' to the old and venerable nun Lucia.Of course, nobody knows what was really discussed during that conversation. TheVatican merely stated that Sister Lucia had identified the paper on which thesecret had been scribbled down as her own. And she had said, that 'the lady'(the Mother of God) had not given the name of the pope in question in thevision. 'We did not know whether it was Benedict XV, or Pius II, or Paul VI, orJohn Paul II, but it was the Pope who was suffering and also caused us tosuffer.'Whoever believes this is insinuating that the good Lord, or the Mother of God,is incapable of manifesting clearly. This would mean it was not possible for theDivine Power to transmit clearly pictures and messages into the brains ofchildren. Some questions need to be asked to disperse the fog around thehappenings of Fátima: * Did anything really happen in Fátima, or was the whole thing an invention of the seer children? * Why should the divine Almighty transmit messages to the brains of children and not to adults or, in our times, directly via electronic media? * Who or what was manifested? * Is the Vatican lying? * If so, why?The only survivor of the events of the year 1917 is the nun Lucia. One maydisagree about her credibility, as it is a fact that she only wrote down hergrandiose experience 24 years after the event. There is, however, nodisagreement about the Sun miracle of Fátima, for it was after all witnessed by70,000 people. What happened to this mass of people on 13 October 1917 becamepart of the press reports. It was photographed, albeit only in black and white.There is no way one can get past the Sun miracle; something definitely out ofthe ordinary took place in Fátima. Those 70,000 witnesses were not all sufferingfrom sensory disorders. Sceptical scientists and critical journalists were ableto witness it and, after all, it lasted a full 12 minutes. Moreover, this Sunmiracle had been announced beforehand to the children of Fátima. To the exactday and minute. It was only because of this announcement that 70,000 people hadset out to make the pilgrimage to the field. Ergo Lucia must have received amessage. But what did happen? And why did it happen through the children? I willhave to explain a few things first, before penetrating to the heart of thematter.Regretfully I have never witnessed an apparition. Since the first time I stayedin Lourdes in 1964, however, I have understood that the phenomenon ofapparitions really exists. I witnessed people in a state of ecstasy, heard themsinging with suffering souls, and watched their great pain. One hundred andfifty years ago, long before Fátima, a 14-year-old girl in Lourdes (France)witnessed the apparition of a white lady in a small rocky grotto. Since then,five million people yearly make the pilgrimage to Lourdes and pray fervently tothe Mother of God. Scientifically verifiable miracle healings have resulted. Howis this possible if the Mother of God is a mere invention of the Church, firstdecided upon and then announced at the Council of Ephesus?The beginning is always a vision, an apparition, a meeting of individual orsmall groups of people with members of families of God(s). In the Christianoccident, these events chiefly involve Mary, the Mother of Jesus. Theapparitions are not of neutral spirits: no advice is given about what peopleshould or should not do, or what is forbidden. Every personified apparitionaffirms himself or herself to be an emissary from Heaven and a divine messengerwho has the power to help or destroy humankind. These apparitions interfere inreligious and political matters, and they even get into the brains of entirewarring groups. I will first sketch a few of these seers, places andcircumstances in order to explain the phenomenon.In the spring of 1947, there was an apparition in Montichiari, 10 kilometressouth of Brescia, in Italy. There, in the hospital chapel, a young nurse namedPierina Gilli saw a beautiful lady in a violet dress floating above the altar.The strange lady was crying. From her breast, without a drop of blood flowingfrom it, protruded three swords. The unknown lady said sadly,'Prayer---Sacrifice---Repentance.'Understandably, the pious Miss Pierina was confused. Were her eyes and minddeceiving her? Or was plain little Pierina dealing with a first vision? Themiracle was repeated on 13 July 1947. This time, the beautiful unknown lady wasdressed in white and the terrible swords were missing, but she was adorned withthree roses---a white one, a red one and a yellow one---all of which protrudedfrom her breast. Shy and courageous at once, Pierina asked, 'Who are you?' Thelady smiled and answered gently, 'I am the Mother of Jesus and the Mother of All. . . I want the 13th of July to be celebrated yearly in honour of the mysteryof the rose [Rosa mystica].'58 Slowly the apparition faded again.This incomprehensible spectacle was repeated on 22 October, and on 16 Novemberand 22 November, whereupon the strange lady solemnly promised to appear again atnoon on 8 December---not in the hospital chapel this time, but in the villagechurch. The news about Pierina's strange experiences had travelled far beyondMontichiari and into the Lombardy countryside. No wonder, then, that on the 8December several thousand people travelled to the village. The main person inthis dramatic event, Pierina Gilli, had to be passed through the wall of peopleand into the church with a great deal of effort and gentle force. There, sheprayed a rosary together with other believers and many curious people. Suddenly,she cried out: 'Oh! The Madonna!'Everyone became silent. But nobody saw a thing. That is, some were not quitecertain that they hadn't seen something. At any rate, everyone's eyes were gluedto Pierina, so as not to miss a word of her conversation with the Mother of God.The message was passed in brief, whispered words out to the masses waitingoutside the church.They gathered that Pierina could see the Mother of God on a tall, white stair,and once again adorned with white, yellow and red roses. With an otherworldlysmile, the lady disclosed, 'I am the immaculate Conception, I am Mary of theMercies, Mother of my divine son Jesus Christ.'While descending the white stair, as in a stage show, she said to Pierina, 'Withthis my coming to Montichiari, I wish henceforth to be called \"the MysticRose.\"' When she got to the bottom steps, she prophesied, 'Whoever prays onthese bricks and sheds tears of repentance, will find a sure ladder to Heaven,and will receive protection and mercy from my motherly heart.'For 19 years nothing further happened. As is usual, Pierina was derided by someof the people, and venerated as a saint by others. From 8 December 1947 onward,the church of Monti-chiari was the goal of believers in miracles and thoseseeking healing, because miracles upon miracles happened there, there was nodoubt about it.Pierina spent White Sunday, 17 April 1966, in the neighbouring village ofFontanelle, only 3 kilometres away. While she was resting on the steps of asmall spring, suddenly and totally unexpectedly, the 'Mystic Rose' floated abovethe water. It instructed Pierina to kiss the steps from top to bottom, threetimes, then order a crucifix to be erected on the left beside the bottom step.All the sick, so the apparition said, before taking water from the spring,should ask Jesus for forgiveness of their sins and kiss the crucifix. Pierinafollowed these instructions. On 13 May 1966, at 11:40, when about 20 people withPierina were praying next to the spring, the 'Mystic Rose' appeared once moreand conveyed the following wish: 'I wish that a comfortable basin be createdhere, so the sick can immerse themselves in the water.' As she was now quiteused to the apparition, Pierina asked the rose-adorned lady, 'How should thespring be called?' The lady answered, 'The Spring of Mercy.' Pierina questionedher again: 'What do you want to happen, here in Fontanelle?' 'Charitable worksfor the sick who will come here,'59 was the answer. Then, the 'Mystic Rose'disappeared.It is 8 June 1966; afternoon. More than 100 people are kneeling and prayingbeside the spring. Shortly after 15:00 hours, Pierina joins them. She asks thevisitors to pray a rosary with her. Moments later, she interrupts her prayer andcalls out, 'Look up to the sky!' This time, some of the believers see a whitelady floating about 6 metres above the spring.The lady is carrying her three roses once again and asks that wafers for hostsbe made out of the corn in the neighbouring field. These hosts are to be takento Fátima on 13 October. Just as the mysterious lady is about to leave, Pierinaasks her to stay. The lady actually turns and listens to Pierina telling herabout the troubles of those present.It is 6 August 1966; afternoon. More than 200 people are praying by the spring.At 14:30 hours, Pierina appears and again asks those present to pray a rosarywith her. During this fourth rosary-mystery, Pierina interrupts, calling out,'Our Dear Lady is present!'Conversations and prayers fall silent. Everyone is listening to Pierinaconversing with a being that is invisible to them. When asked for furtherdirections as to what should be done with the home-made hosts, the 'Mystic Rose'asks that some of the grain should be sent to her 'dearly beloved son PopePaul,' with the note that it had been blessed by her presence. Also, theremaining grain should be used to bake rolls and to distribute them inFontanelle in memory of her coming. Since then, one prays and hopes inFontanelle as well as in Montichiari. All day and all night. Just as in manyplaces where apparitions or visions have occurred. All in all, this is a classicexample of this kind of apparition. A person, unknown until that moment, seessomething, tells others, and the round of prayers begins. But how can a Motherof God manifest, if, from an historical perspective, she never existed? How canthe apparition state of itself that it is 'the immaculate Conception' and'Mother of the divine son Jesus Christ' if both statements are false? Why doesthe strange lady appear first with swords in her breast, then with roses thatappear to grow out of her body? Why should the Mother of God attach suchimportance to being called the 'Mystic Rose'? And why does the 'Rosa mystica'always stage its appearance wherever Pierina happens to be present? First in thehospital chapel, then in the village church, then in Fontanelle? Why should shenot manifest again for 19 years, and what benefit does the divine power derivefrom having the young Pierina kiss the steps three times? And finally, why hasnothing at all happened for the last 25 years? Is there some power out thereplaying about with us humans?The method of circling around a problem for possibilities for solutions is notmy invention. The explanation of curious phenomena requires methodicalprocedures, and the circumstances of the facts need to be determined.I have spent the last 35 years dealing with apparitions of all kinds. When Ibegan creating a case archive, I had no idea what an overwhelming mass ofprinted matter I would have to cope with. I had to be selective, which means Ichose cases that would stand for many similar other ones, so that I would beable to offer a possible answer out of the sum of the characteristics. The factthat more than 40,000 (!) apparitions have been counted in the Christian worldalone, will give some idea of the polysemantic nature of the matter. One thing Ivery quickly noticed when looking at this material was that apparitions are nota problem of the present. They can be found throughout the history of humankind.One of the psychological explanations thus has the rug pulled out from under itby this observation. I repeatedly hear that apparitions occur in the brains ofchildren, only because they cannot cope with the problems of our present times.A load of nonsense, is all I can say, based on my own experience.On 16 August every year, a blood-soaked cloth is prayed to by believers inIborra, Spain. This has been going on since 1010. At that time, the mostreverend gentleman Bernard Olivier, while ringing the bell during theconsecration, had sudden doubts about whether the red wine really wastransformed into Christ's blood. Suddenly, the red wine (or the blood) hadincreased in a mysterious way and had flowed down from the altar table onto thesteps and onto the floor of the chapel. Horror gripped the churchgoers. A fewresolute women fetched cloths and began to mop up the blood. Pope Sergius IV(1009-1012) permitted the public adoration of the bloody cloth of Iborra. And ithas gone on to this day. It means that not only holy figures causemanifestations.The pious Monsieur Thierry, the rector of Paris University, was murdered inPirlemont, Brabant, in 1073. The brutal murderers threw his body into a murkypool of water. When search parties were combing the area looking for MonsieurThierry, a wondrous light shone out of the pool. In thanks for this strangeapparition, an artist painted on a wooden panel a picture of the Mother of Godfloating above water. In 1297, the picture was transferred to a new chapel.During the celebrations for the official consecration, the picture suddenlybegan to shine and was enveloped in light as of flames.60 Hundreds witnessed itand some described it. No holy figure appeared during this phenomenon.On a hill called Codol, 5 kilometres from Javita, near Valencia in Spain, asmall throng of Christian warriors was fighting against an Islamic army, farsuperior in numbers, on 23 February 1239. Before the battle, six of theChristian chiefs asked for holy communion. They were just able to makeconfession, but were not able to receive the sacrament, because at that precisemoment, the battle cry of the enemy resounded from the nearby castle of Chio andpenetrated the church. The chiefs rushed to arm themselves. Full of fear thatthe Muslims could destroy the church, the priest hid away the altar cloth andhosts under a heap of stones. The Christian warriors carried the day. When thepriest went to retrieve the altar cloth from its hiding place, six bloody hostswere stuck to it. But this was not all! Next day, the Muslims advanced withreinforcements. The situation seemed hopeless; the Christians had to retreat tothe castle Chio, which they had taken the day before. Following a sudden hunch,the priest bound the cloth with the six bloody prints to a pole and waved it atthe enemy from the top of the castle battlements. According to the legend, raysof light went out from the altar cloth that had such power, the greatly superiorforces of the enemy fled.Is this proof that apparitions are able to vanquish entire armies? Or is it onlya pious legend? Since the 13th century, every traveller to Spain can visit thechurch of Daroca and check the altar cloth with the six bloody spots.61 I shouldpoint out here, however, that the opposite has also occurred, according tolegends, namely, that Christians armies took flight due to Muslim apparitions.Do divine powers sometimes help one side and sometimes the other? And do thesewondrous events occur only in the Christian and Muslim worlds?According to the legends, Rome was founded by Romulus and Remus, the twin sonsof Mars. Romulus, who ruled in Rome from 753 to 716 BC, was once visited by theapparition of Servius Tullius (the sixth Roman king, 578-534 BC), son of Vulcan,who manifested in a 'fiery glow above his head.'62 The god of healing,Asclepios, appeared in the temple of Epidauros (Greece) about as often as thechief consultant at the bedsides of our clinics. Naturally, countless miraclesoccurred in Epidauros, long before Christianity. The Roman lawgiver NumaPompilius, Minos (King of Knossos) and Lycurgos (lawgiver of Sparta) generallyreceived their creative ideas directly through apparitions of the gods. Aeneas,hero of the Trojan cycle of legends, appeared to his son Ascanius after hisdeath, wearing full armour and with all his followers. The ancient Iranianfounder of a religion, Zoroaster, who was active as a prophet c. 600 BC,received the decisive passages of his religious writings (Avesta) throughseveral visions. Mohammed, the founder of Islam, who proclaimed Allah, receivedmany of the revelations that were laid down in the Koran through visions.And so it goes on. Visions or apparitions of all kinds influenced thinkingthroughout the history of humankind, right through to Fátima. What isparticularly noticeable, is that in 90 per cent of the cases, it is children whoare the recipients or transmitters of these transcendental phenomena. Actually,I find that rather logical. Children before puberty do not have many worries.Their opinions are not yet fixed, and their consciousness has not yet passedthrough the brain-washing process of the everyday grind. They still have theirnaïve inquisitiveness and child-like imagination.I can well imagine that pictures can be projected into the minds of children,and also, that the information that goes with it can be transferred bytelepathy. This would mean that apparitions were not objective, neither able tobe photographed nor measurable, but still, from the child's point of view, theywould be subjective and therefore clearly perceivable via the limbic system. Thechild will swear blind that it has perceived an apparition, while all otherspresent have seen nothing. But how can the absurd thought be created in a brain,for example, that a mysterious lady wants to be called 'Mystic Rose'? Are humanswith such imaginings simply psychically disposed, or is the apparition with allaccompanying manifestations simply something that has risen from theimagination? If it is pure fantasy, where do the accompanying manifestationscome from, like the medical cures, or the Sun miracle of Fátima, which waswitnessed by some 70,000 people? And if it is a 'picture projected directly intothe brain by telepathy,' who is doing the projecting? Who is the sender of thethought transfer?All apparitions are full of contradictions. In the case of apparitions of Marythe Mother of God, she always refers to the power lent her by her son. If shedoes indeed have this power at her disposal and has the burning desire to beworshipped by believers all over the world, then why does she appear in suchout-of-the-way places, and usually to poor little souls who are actually able todo very little to fulfil her desires? Places of pilgrimage like Fátima, Lourdesor Guadelupe (in Mexico) are exceptions in so far as they are world-renownedcentres for the worship of Mary. Most other apparitions have occurred with aminimum of publicity. Apparitions of Mary are also mainly a Catholic phenomenon.Believers of all other religions know very little about Mary as the Mother ofGod, or do not acknowledge her Ascension (into Heaven) in the flesh.Every year, year after year, the Pope gives his blessing urbi et orbi (to thecity of Rome and to the world) on high church feast days from the balcony of hispalace in Rome. Television stations transmit this highest papal blessing to thewhole world, and a sea of 200,000 believers cheers on St Peter's Square. If somedivine power really wished to receive more worship than hitherto and desire thathumans should do penance in some area of life, why then---please!---do they notlaunch a proper apparition right there in St Peter's Square?Things get even more bewildering. In September 2000, the Welt am Sonntagreported apparitions of Mary in Egypt.63 The Holy Virgin had appeared severaltimes above St Mark's church in the town of Assiut. At first, white doves hadappeared, then a beam of light, which was allegedly so supernaturally bright andstrong that observers had to look away. The official weekly of the orthodoxCoptic Church in Egypt, Watani, reported that entire flocks of white pigeons hadsuddenly remained in the air above the dome of the church. These pigeons had hadunusually long feathers. After the pigeons came the brilliant beam of light, andthen the 'Holy Virgin.' Since then, there has been no end to the streams ofpilgrims to Assiut. The believers march to the church of St Mark to plead forthe blessing of the Mother of God. According to several traditions, appearancesof Mary occur again and again in Egypt. In this century alone, three of theseapparitions were officially confirmed by the Coptic Church.And under which umbrella do all these apparitions of Mary fit? The Mother ofGod, 'ascended into Heaven' is, after all, one of the dogmas of the RomanCatholic Church. So, why does the highest female representative of the CatholicChurch not stick to her very own church? Do Catholics not have an exclusiveright to the Mother of God? Does she show herself to believers of other faiths?And why? No telepathic messages were transmitted at Assiut.The first apparition of the Mother of God in America occurred on 9 December1531. The Spaniards had conquered Central America. A religious war was raging inMexico, which was won by the Spanish. Hundreds of thousands of Mayans and Aztecshad been slaughtered; any kind of reconciliation between the two cultures seemedimpossible. Then, early one morning in December 1531, Juan Diego, a 51-year-oldIndio, heard strange music that seemed to be coming from nowhere. Juan stared upand heard a voice from the sky that told him to climb up the hill calledTepeyac. When he arrived at the top, he saw a beautiful lady whose robe shonelike the Sun. The stones round about, even the rock on which the lady stood,sparkled and winked like gold and emeralds. 'Listen to me, Juanito, the smallestof my sons, where do you want to go?' the voice asked him. Juan really wanted toget to the other side of the hill, but the lady bade him go to the Bishop ofMexico and to tell him about this encounter. The bishop would not believe a wordof what the Indio told him. Juan went back to the hill and asked the lady, whohad promptly appeared again, to give him something as evidence. The lady orderedJuan to pick flowers, to wrap them in a cloak and take them to the bishop.Juan obeyed. Although the guards at the palace tried to dissuade him, Juanfinally managed to penetrate to the bishop. There were other people in the room.Juan reported what he had been told by the lady, and opened his cloak with theflowers. At that moment, a brilliant, blinding light appeared and Juan's cloakwas transformed into a picture of the lady in front of all those present. Shewas wearing a shining blue cloak decorated with golden stars, and red and whiterays shot out of the cloak.Today, on the hill of Tepeyac, stands the largest shrine to Mary in the whole ofthe Americas, the Nacional Basilica de la Santisima Maria del Guadelupe.Millions of believers pray to the Mother of God and stare at the coloured clothfrom 1531 that should not really exist. The cloth consists of agave fibres thatdecay rapidly and in the best cases last for about 20 years. But this cloth hasbeen hanging above the main altar of the basilica for almost 500 years. And thatis not all. The cloth, which has been examined by experts, including painters atseveral universities, is in reality colourless. It contains no traces of colour.Nevertheless, 20 million people every year see this colourful cloth. Theconstellations of stars on the blue mantle correspond to the 46 stars that wouldhave been visible above Mexico in the winter of 1531. And as microscopicphotographs confirm, the eyes of the lady mirror images of the bishop and allthose present in the room, when Juan Diego opened his cloak full of flowers.I have been in the Basilica of Guadelupe, glided along the travelator along withmany other believers, and stared up in awe, like all the others, at the colouredpicture that contains no colours. A miracle. In Guadelupe, there is no way out.Here, a divine lady manifested and left behind a material piece of evidence forher existence. By the way, after this apparition, the sexual barriers betweenthe Spanish conquerors and the Indios, the original inhabitants, fell, and acompletely new type of human was created. And a total reconciliation was broughtabout between the warring religions.The Pope is infallible, and this is a dogma of the Catholic Church. True toJesus's orders to Peter the Apostle, in Heaven 'all will be bound which you bindon earth, and all will be dissolved in heaven that you dissolve on earth.' TheRoman popes see themselves as the direct successors of Peter the Apostle, andlogically they can do no wrong in Church matters, because even if they didannounce something wrong, it would be blessed in Heaven anyway. Now, we knowfrom history that the popes were not infallible, even in Church matters. Mycountryman, Catholic theologian Professor Dr Hans Küng, has remarked, 'Theerrors of Church teaching are numerous and serious; today, when open discussioncan no longer be forbidden, they can no longer be disputed even by conservativetheologians and Church leaders.'64 The condemnation of Galilei, who taught thatthe Earth moved around the Sun, and not the other way around, the condemnationof Darwin's theory of evolution and the excommunication of the Patriarch ofConstantinople were all based on the better-known errors. Not to speak ofCatholic birth control. A list of erroneous decisions would be a long one.Now, the popes believe that they are guided by the Holy Spirit in theirpositions as teachers. How come? With all those errors? According to Catholicteaching, the Holy Ghost is equal to God, as the Father, the Son and the HolySpirit are all one. This would mean that God announces things that are wrongthrough the Holy Spirit and its earthly representatives. The illogic of thisbites its own tail. Professor Dr Hans Küng had his permission to teach religionrevoked by the Church due to his critical questioning. After that, he becameProfessor for Ecumenical Theology at the University of Tübingen and was allowedto think about world ethics. Much the same thing happened to his contemporary,Eugen Drewermann. This doctor of theology also had his licence to teach religionrevoked because he thought aloud---too loudly. Drewermann thought about theall-merciful, good God and could not stand it any longer:A God who can do everything and still does nothing, deserves not to beconsidered bene-volent, if he watches so many disastrous things without doinganything. Or the other way around, if he were really good and could not himselfprevent things, he would not be almighty; both charac-teristics can not beunited, as long as the world is the way it is, a vale of tears. Bothcharacteristics, almightiness as well as goodness, inalienably belong to theconcept of the Divine, according to Christian theology. There can be no otherconclusion; it is the world itself that contradicts the Christian God as itscreator. Or to put it another way, the moral assertion that is incorporated inthe Christian idea of the godhead, is rendered ad absurdum by the reality of theworld.65Itis not Erich von Däniken who is bringing up these critical and logicalquestions. Many others have done so, among them not a few professors oftheology, who afterwards had to pick up their hats and leave. The Church willnot brook intelligence. Unlike the professors, I do not need to be afraid oflosing a teaching position.The question about the Mother of God who appeared in Fátima and elsewhere, andobviously had the power to produce a Sun miracle, has been asked by otherstoo.66 Who was shown there? Who is influencing humans, or at least tries to?Those who have researched this material are certain of the validity of theseevents, that some of these apparitions really occurred and are not just figmentsof imagination in a few heads.Some years ago Dr Johannes Fiebag, a brilliant thinker, who died far too youngand who can be counted alongside people like Hans Küng and Eugen Drewermann, setup a hypothesis to try and explain some of these apparitions---a mimicryhypothesis.67 In science, mimicry is the term used to describe animals' andplants' adaptation to their environment. Mimicry is also part of the protectiveor camouflaging appearance of butterflies, grasshoppers or chameleons, who haveadapted to their environments so well that their enemies can no longer see them.They take on shapes and colours that make them almost invisible. Nature is fullof mimicry. Based on this fact, Dr Fiebag asked himself whether mimicry was alsoapplicable to extraterrestrials:Don a virtual reality body suit, step into a world created by a programmer outof bits and bytes, take on a shape you fancy, or which you believe theinhabitants of that world might like. Fairy or elf, God or the Devil, spaceshiptraveller or little grey man. No matter. Let your imagination run riot. Or usethe programmed imagination installed for the inhabitants of your artificialworld.The virtual figures you meet believe in higher beings that appear as flyinghumans from Magonia? This is no problem. A quick hand movement, you type in anoption from the menu provided for you and, hey presto, you are a spaceman fromMagonia. You turn up again a few centuries later. (Centuries mean nothing to youwho are outside the entire system.) You find out that alien intelligences arethought to be little grey men who whisk through space in shining starships andsteal women's babies? No problem. You type in an option from your menu, and youare such a UFOnaut.Why would you do this? Perhaps it is just a game to you. Perhaps it is a test.Perhaps it is an experiment. Perhaps it is a higher programme that you and yourcolleagues are working on. Perhaps it serves to 'lift' theconsciousness-contents created in the virtual world, to develop them, tostimulate them to further evolution beyond the phases of regression orstandstill.Naturally, you know that you are not God. You make mistakes. You may have todeceive certain consciousness-contents, which you have developed inside theartificial environment of your computer. They must not realise the truth,whatever that truth may be. Not yet. Everything needs time. You pretendsomething in front of these 'beings.' You playact. You tell them stories, bestof all, what they want to hear, that you are really a fairy, that you reallycome from Magonia, that you really do steal embryos. All depending. And you makesure that any kind of pieces of evidence disappear again . . .UFO apparitions, apparitions of Mary, of Bigfoot, spaceships that dissolve,spaceships that crash, extraterrestrial corpses and semi-earthly foetuses: allthis is as real or unreal as our total reality. The Others even proceed verycleverly and with a certain enigmatic sense of humour. They meet our ancestorswho think the Others are gods, not only as beings radiant with light, but asastronauts: the Others use spaceships, which can be built nowadays, they usetemples as Earthbases, the purpose of which can only now be recognised. Theyleave behind technical apparatuses and other artefacts, which are destined toexperience adventurous sojourns through history. They have buildings erectedthat turn out to be data carriers of timeless information.And what is all this for? Fiebag suggests, 'We should begin to question againour origins and our concepts of the world. It is a change of angle with which weview things that will lead us to new futures and insights.'Could the mimicry hypothesis provide the solution to all the inexplicable thingsthat happen in the world of religion? Is this hypothesis able to help explainwhy a certain Joseph Smith (founder of the Mormon religion) sees an apparitionof the angel Moroni who dictates the Book of Mormon to him? Do the messages thatwere received by various religious founders originate in an outer-earthly world?Are dwarves who have supposedly appeared to many a solitary wanderer in themountains the same as the jinn (spirits) that appear in great numbers in Arabicliterature? Are apparitions nothing but manifestations caused by an alientechnology streets ahead of ours? Those who would argue that the good Lord orthe divine Almighty is behind it all, must have a very different concept of Godto the one I have. If all those religions, which squabble with each other soself-righteously, are all inspired by the Spirit of God, then this Spirit of Godmust be playing a moody and unlovely game with us, as millions of people have sofar lost their lives and hundreds of thousands have been tortured because ofthis religious self-righteousness. Notable Christian theologians who have takena stance against a pseudo-God have all been chucked out, in the name ofreligion. In the Islamic world, one would not even dare to begin to ask criticalquestions.At least 10 per cent of all publicly known cases of apparitions are factual.Fátima with its Sun miracle is one of them. Basically, there are threepossibilities to explain it all: * Looked at historically, there is no Mother of God. She was an invention of the early Church. Many pre-Christian religions already had mother goddesses. So no mother goddess can appear. The apparition must have another source. * It is true that the Mother of God is an invention of the early Christian Church but the popes have allowed this invention to become reality. True to the gospel passage '. . . that which you will bind on earth, will be bound in Heaven, and that which you dissolve on earth shall be dissolved in Heaven' (Matthew 16, 19). An invented Mother of God has become a real Mother of God. * Somebody out there is playing with us. The powers of this alien somebody are far beyond any earthly technology (mimicry hypothesis). Just as they are playing with us, they could destroy us at any time. Then, one needs to ask, who is this universal Player? Is there an hierarchical order among Players, which ensures that under-developed civilisations like us are not scrapped? And who or what then is the very highest God behind the Players? Even a civilisation of spirit beings that we can't really imagine has to have begun sometime.Variation a) is really quite sensible. The only problem with it is thatapparitions of Mary do exist. Variation b) is the least likely. Why? BecauseJesus really would have to have been the 'only born son of God.' But everyexpert with any number of doctorates, who has dealt with this question in ourtimes and knows how the gospels were compiled, will deny the concept of a son ofGod.68, 69, 70 And if the Holy Ghost really was the basis of the gospels, aswell as the Koran, how could it then declare, via Mohammed, 'But it is notseemly for Allah to have had a son'? This son of God finally would have beensent to humans to liberate them from original sin. Which then lands us back withthe contradictions of the Old Testament.Variation c) is possible, but there is no real proof to hand. Now I am one ofthose people who will always ask for the cause of a thing. (Who or what would bethe very highest God behind the Players?) Every event is caused by anotherevent. This assumption is no longer valid in the unspeakably difficult field ofquantum physics. The causality principle---cause equals effect---has beensuspended. Quantum physics lives in a kind of ghost world, in which we askourselves where something as strange as information comes from, or where stateslike conscious-ness, the imagination, or creativity come from. The imaginationin my head does exist, and I know roughly how neurons and their circuits work inmy brain. But this does not explain my imagination. If it arises because ofquantum-physical effects, these effects cannot be measured and, apart from atheory, I have no proper understanding of it. If the children of Fátima onlyexperienced the events in their heads, then what was the origin of the Sunmiracle? And should the Fátima apparition really only be based onquantum-physical effects, how were the 'ghosts' behind the quantum physics ableprecisely to predict one month before the event that a Sun miracle would takeplace on 13 October 1917?One feels quite alone in this world, and chases from one contradiction toanother. The Sun miracle of Fátima on 13 October 1917 was a real event,triggered by a Mother of God who should not exist, historically speaking, andwho was confirmed by a religion that alleges it is the only true one, eventhough other religions make the same claim. Behind all this there is supposed tobe some Holy Ghost, which is at the same time God, and guides the popes---who,in turn, have definitely made erroneous announcements. With all this confusion,variation c) still suits me best. The three popes since 1960 have doneeverything to make variation c) at least thinkable. Remember:Fátima 1917. Sister Lucia does not neatly write down the third secret of Fátimauntil 1941, and hands the envelope over to the Bishop of Leiria who, in turn,keeps it in his safe for 13 years before it is sent to the Holy See in Rome.There, the envelope remains lying somewhere for another 18 months, until PopeJohn XXIII opens it on 1 August 1959. John XXIII seals the envelope, and givesit back to the Holy Office with the command not to make the message public. Sixyears later, the same thing happens under Paul VI, and, 14 years after that,again under John Paul II. On 18 July 1981---after the assassination attempt onthe Pope---the same thing happens a fourth time. All the popes refuse topublish, with the argument that 'it concerns our Faith.' Eighty-three yearsafter Fátima (on 19 April 2000), the Pope sends a high-ranking emissary to theaged nun Lucia in order to pose some questions regarding the interpretation ofthe third secret. This means that things were not clear; the Holy Mother musthave expressed herself unclearly 83 years before. Moreover, the Holy Ghost hadnot guided the understanding of the nun, when the latter wrote down the messagein 1941. In the middle of 2000, the Holy Office suddenly decides to release thetext of the secret---and nothing happens. Had the text that was released in June2000, with a long-winded commentary by Cardinal Ratzinger, been identical to theoriginal text, there would have been no reason not to have released it before.The version that was released in the summer of 2000 would have been renderedcompletely absurd by the popes' statements that they could not publish thesecret because it pertained to 'the Faith' and it would 'cause a panic amonghumans.' They are cheating in the Vatican. Originally, Sister Lucia had saidthat 'the lady' requested the secret should be published on 17 October 1960.Later, Lucia explained that not 'the lady' but she herself had set the date,'because one would not, as I felt, understand it before 1960.' Even if thisstatement is true---and was not, as I suspect, foisted on the aged nun---thepopes would not have understood the message in 1960 either, because they allrefused to publish it. I fear that the Vatican has manoeuvred itself into adreadful story from which it cannot disentangle itself. The reasons arecompelling:On 18 October 1942, Pope Pius XII had dedicated Fátima to the 'Immaculate Heartof Mary.' Pius XII did not know the secret! (It was not opened until 1959.) Thisdedication emphatically advanced Fátima to become a Catholic place of pilgrimagein honour of the Mother of God. This could not be reversed, as the popes areinfallible. Fátima grew and grew into an unbelievable centre of the Catholiccult of Mary. In 1959, Pope John XXIII read the message for the first time andmust have been terribly shocked, because no announcement by Mother Mary wascontained in it. The same happened to the succeeding popes. Logically, theycould no longer make the Fátima message public because Fátima had meanwhilebecome a unique place of pilgrimage. The statement issued by the popes, that themessage had to do with 'our Faith,' was absolutely correct. The same goes forthe statement by John Paul II, who had said in Fulda, in 1980, 'My predecessorsof the Holy See preferred a diplomatic version because of the serious content.'Correct. It concerned the Faith in the truest sense of the term and was very'serious,' because how could one have explained to believers afterwards that itwas not about a message from 'the dear Mother of Jesus'? This also explains whythe Bishop of Leiria kept the message for 13 years. Naturally, he had read itand could not make much of it. Perhaps he hoped that the Wheel of Time mightturn differently in the future, and perhaps the child Lucia had imagined it allback in 1917. (According to the statement made by Sister Lucia, the envelope wasto be opened by the Patriarch of Lisbon and/or the Bishop of Leiria.)And what might have really been contained in the original text of the thirdsecret of Fátima? Nobody knows, apart from those in the know. But 70,000 peoplewitnessed a Sun miracle, a rotating, glowing disc, which appeared for 12minutes. I consider this to be a good clue that a group of extraterrestrials wasconcerned. Maybe, in the message, they were greeting humankind and were pointingout that we do not live alone in the universe. Perhaps they even indicated thatthey would come back soon and that it would be sensible if humankind wereprepared for such an event. As long as the Vatican refuses to publish theunvarnished truth, any halfway sensible thought is justified, because itcertainly did not happen the way the popes and Cardinal Ratzinger have depictedit. Quod erat demonstrandum.As popes and members of the Holy Office, generally speaking, do not know muchabout space travel, and even less about ETs, about interstellar distances orabout the multitude of possibilities of extraterrestrial life, much less abouttechnologies of the distant future, one has to fear that they themselves do notunderstand the 'serious' (John Paul II) nature of the message of Fátima. Giventheir unshakeable faith, they might assume that the message had come from thedivine adversary, the Devil. That would have been just as bad as a message fromextraterrestrials, because, after all, Fátima has become a Catholic place ofpilgrimage.Personally I dislike the entire development as much as countless believingCatholics do. I myself was brought up as a Catholic. I too find it painful tohave to say goodbye to the beautiful images from my childhood. I know thewonderful hymns sung in honour of the Mother of God. I know the very pleasantfeeling of connection with other believers in a church. I know the Gregorianchants, the organ music, the smell of incense and the candlelight. If I havebrought up the same kind of questions here that have been raised by eminenttheologians, and have offered some possible answers, then one should not startlooking for deep psychological reasons for it. I am not conducting a reckoningwith something from the past, nor do I wish to confuse believers (who will notbe reading this book anyway). So why all these reflections about Fátima and theOld Testament? Because the way the whole thing is portrayed is not the truth.Because people do not like to be lied to. Because other people should also havethoughts about God and their religion and should not just stubbornly believe insomething. Belief needs no proof---and makes you happy. That is precisely thedanger. Every church and every sect, after all, maintains they are in possessionof the lone truth. So people fight for this (alleged) truth and resort to swordsand machine guns. And might they not resort to an atomic bomb or a chemicalweapon---in God's name---to eradicate those who believe in something different?The number of conflicts worldwide that have a religious background are risingevery year. The planet is teeming with pious fanatics and ruthless warriors ofGod. Good, sensible people behave decently towards other people, whether theyare religious or not. To make good, decent people do something terrible andevil, you need religion. Any dreadful deed can be justified in the name ofreligion. This is the reason I do what I do. I am defending myself againstreligious righteousness and look upon myself more as a 'worker in the vineyardof the Lord,' because most of what we humans attach to the good Lord is aninsult towards the grandiose creation. The path to enlightenment was always astony one and our earthly ideal of morals and ethics need not necessarily beidentical with the way otherworldly beings think.Now that the Mother of God has appeared (not just in Fátima), there is at leasta vague way out of the dilemma for believers, and to set the world right to adegree. Let us take variation c), the mimicry hypothesis. Somebody out there isplaying with us. This somebody knows human beings and their religions, ofcourse, and knows that millions of us believe absolutely in a Mother of God. So,they slip into the role of this Mother of God, call themselves by that name, andmanifest themselves as such. And the world is back on line. Ave Maria!"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 3: Entire Forests of Stupas[The_Gods_Were_Astronauts_split_001.html#filepos1634] \"There is no customs duty on thoughts, but you still get a lot of hassle.\"---KARL KRAUSETHE road lay in semi-darkness. Everywhere the little fires of hot-food stallsflickered in the gloom. The place was teeming with brown people, all sitting ontiny stools that were only about 15 cm high, and even the little tables seemedmade for dwarfland. Was I among Lilliputians? No, the people around me werenormal sized, although the height of the tiny stools made their knees come up totheir chests. I actually felt rather lost at the thought of having to sit therelike that, a bit like a giant in kindergarten---and I myself am only 1.68 mtall. A wide variety of odours penetrated my nose, like little flags ofdifferent colours, from sweet to sour, rancid to burnt, every imaginable smell.The next crossroad in this chessboard pattern of the town's streets brought meto the main arterial road. Now all the cooking smells became mingled with thestink of traffic exhaust fumes. Even the edge of the main road was clutteredwith hundreds of little tables and stools. In between them, laid out on theground, were masses of goods: plastic kitsch for the little ones, sandals andshoes beside shirts and bolts of fabrics in all colours, and then, in a lineabout 60 m long, a stretch of spectacles, for any face or nose on this earth. Ihad trouble trying to avoid treading on anything.Asia's cities and towns all look the same; they taste alike and, superficiallyat least, the people seem to be the same too. Yet the town I was walking throughwas completely different.Right in front of me, less than 300 m away in the centre of the crossroad, whatappeared to be a multi-phase space rocket pointed towards the sky. It wasilluminated by numerous spotlights and was covered from its base to its tip withpure gold. An extremely awe-inspiring sight. I felt respect in the face of thisstupendous accomplishment in the name of religion. What looked like a rocket wasjust one of several thousand pagodas in a land of golden stupas---bell-shapedstructures, each of which end in a narrow tower. Years ago, the country wascalled Burma. Today, this country, situated between Thailand, China and India,is called Myanmar. The city I was exploring is called Yangon (formerly Rangoon).The place is teeming with indescribably splendid pagodas, even in the midst ofall the activity of cars, shops and pedestrians and along the bank of theAyeyarwady river. Only the Buddha and the government are wealthy in thiscountry. Nowhere else in the world is the Buddha revered so much as in Myanmar.For millennia, year after year, the believers have sacrificed tons of gold leafand precious gems to adorn the pagodas and to attain some form of relief in thislife or the next. I was standing in front of the Sule pagoda, which is alsocalled 'the Heart of the City.' Although night had fallen some time ago, and thetraffic all around the pagoda gave rise to a bad smell, here and there I couldsee believers in front of small shrines, staring reverently at the figures andsmall lights behind the grids. A kind of enchantment reigns here that the worldoutside Myanmar cannot comprehend.This country is interwoven with religion and astrology. The children do not havepersonal names as we know them, and they do not adopt the names of theirfathers. Moreover, you cannot distinguish the sex of a child purely by his orher name. Boys or girls can be called Kyan Kyan, Zan Zan, Maung Maung, or evenCho Cho. The difference between male and female is only apparent later on, whenthe words 'Mr' or 'Mrs' are added. All names have something to do with the dayof the week and the month of birth, but they can be changed during the course ofone's life. So, for example, a person may only use the first five letters of amonth if they are born on a Monday. Moreover, the glyphs of the alphabetconsisting of 33 letters, must be rising, or consecutive as in Tuesday,Wednesday, Thursday. This is because life is seen as rising upwards. If someonestarts a company, the name of that company will be determined by an astrologer.The name of the firm can only be altered by a superior astrologer, for exampleif business is not going well. Somebody who was born on a Friday will usuallysacrifice at an altar that is dedicated to Friday. It is hardly surprising that,in this country, thousands upon thousands of pagodas are astronomically aligned.The Sule pagoda in front of which I was standing was dedicated to the planets,the celestial animals and the eight celestial directions. Myanmar was a monarchybefore the British made it a colony. Reigning King Mindon (1853-1878)transferred his residence to Mandalay, a fairy-tale city in the centre ofMyanmar, precisely on the 2,400th anniversary of the death day of the Buddha.Even the name Mandalay sounds like music to Western ears. Mandalay was Buddha'scity, and in the face of the British threat, King Mindon called 'the fifth greatsynod' in Mandalay, a gathering that was rather similar to the councils in theChristian Church. At that time, in 1872, 2,400 Buddhist scholars came togetherin Mandalay and compiled the Tipitaka canon, the Buddhist 'teaching of the threebaskets.' Before that, the teaching had only existed in writing on palm leaves,but the king now had it chiselled into 729 marble tablets. They were to remainindestructible until the coming of the next Buddha. According to this teaching,a Buddha will return every 5,000 years. Two thousand four hundred years hadpassed since the Buddha's last appearance, so the tablets had to last foranother 2,600 years. King Mindon therefore had a pagoda erected over each marbletablet. The result was a complex that has been dubbed the 'biggest book in theworld,' and rightly so. A modern paper copy consists of 38 volumes of 400 pageseach. Christianity really cannot come up with anything similar to match it.Considering their weapons technology, it was no wonder that the British werevictorious over the kings of Mandalay. They built a fort and ruled over thecountry and the river right up north to the border with China. Literarychronicler and protagonist of British colonial power Rudyard Kipling madeMandalay immortal in his poem:> On the road to Mandalay,> Where the flyin' fishes play . . .> Come you back to Mandalay,> Where the old Flotilla lay . . .> For the wind in the trees> And the temple bells they say,> You British soldier,> Come you back to Mandalay.> ---(R. KIPLING: 'The Road to Mandalay,' 1887)The British called Myanmar Burma, but in 1989 the country reverted back to itsoriginal name. Like the story of most countries, Myanmar's history begins with amythological time. Sometime in the past, dragons or flying serpents (nagas)camefrom the sky and had instructed the first human beings.71 They also showedhumans how to extract gold and precious stones from the earth and from water. Tothis day, the people of Myanmar see the 2,170 kilometre long river Ayeyarwady asthe line of the dragon, and even the outline of the country is thought to belike that of a dragon. The Ayeyarwady is like the jugular vein of the country,comparable to the Nile in Egypt. The dragon motif is known all over Asia and isone of the prehistoric riddles of humankind. No human being can have ever seen afire-spewing dragon, because no such being exists in the evolution of ourplanet. I once heard that ancient memories of dinosaurs might be the root of themotif, but this comparison does not work either. When dinosaurs were at theirpeak 60 million years ago, not even a prototype human being existed. In China,Myanmar's neighbour, dragon kings were the original bringers of culture and thefounders of the first dynasty. Several Chinese rulers enjoyed the privilege ofexperiencing a celestial flight in a flying dragon, together with their entirehouseholds.72 Chinese mythologies feature reports about this celestial dragon,describing how it had flown across the earth making a loud noise and terrifyingeveryone, but how it had also brought items of culture to humans and instructedthem in many things.73 During the reign of Chuen, one of the founding emperorsof China, the divine architect Yu had had an enormous tower erected in themiddle of a lake, in order to observe more easily the flight movements of thedragon in the sky.74 The celestial dragon is universally present in themythologies---right into Christian times, although a dragon was almost certainlynever observed. Saints George, Sylvester and Michael have always been connectedwith dragons. Of course, the dragon appears in the Book of Revelation of the NewTestament and also among the prophets of the Old Testament. Dragons appear inpictorial form on early Sumerian cylinder seals and on Egyptian palettes; theyare depicted as flying serpents in the tombs of pharaohs in the Valley of theKings. For the (much later) Central American peoples, the feathered serpent wasa symbol of gods who had come from above. Just to mention in passing, the samemotif---in the form of the thunderbird---appears among North American Indians.No one can deny that the flying serpent has a firm place in many creation myths.Why? Psychologists think our ancestors had observed an unusual bird. But birdsdo not spew fire, do not make loud noises, do not make the valleys tremble, donot take passengers on board, do not beget children (which happened in China)and certainly do not instruct humans. People in the Stone Age knew birds and hadnames for them. But the 'thing' that was observed all over the world could nothave been a bird. People groped for words and comparisons because thisindescribable thing did not exist. At some point, it became a fire-spewingserpent and, in the Asiatic world, a dragon. Shocked by what they had seen,fathers reported these impressive events to their sons and their grandsons. Overthe course of time, these original factual accounts lost their contours andfinally found a nesting place in myths. A myth is a kind of vague folk memory.The same happened in Myanmar. No country borders existed in the Stone Age, sowhat was true for Chinese mythology was equally valid for the (present)neighbouring country, Myanmar. The first historically verifiable group of peoplein the land along the Ayeyarwady river are the Mon people. The Mon came fromcentral Asia and linguistically they belonged to the Mon-Khmer culture. This isknown from inscriptions. The Mon people had adopted Buddhism and, according tolegends, had erected the first pagoda as early as 2,500 years ago: the Shwedagonpagoda in Rangoon.The present-day Shwedagon pagoda is almost indescribable: 'It is said that thereis more gold on the Shwedagon pagoda than in the Bank of England.' This quote isfrom the only really outstanding travel guide on Myanmar, by Wilhelm Klein andGünter Pfannmüller. Both men are extraordinarily knowledgeable about thiscountry:The massive, bell-shaped stupa alone forms a single, 100 m tall treasure chest.If the legend can be believed, eight hairs of the last Buddha, as well asfurther relics of the three Buddhas who lived before him [who, it is said, camein intervals of 5,000 years], are contained inside. And outside . . . Well, thestupa is bedecked with 8,688 gold plates, of which each individual one would beworth about DM 1,000 [£320 or $490] according to present calculations. 5,448diamonds, as well as 2,317 rubies, sapphires and topazes adorn its top; agigantic emerald that catches the first and last sunbeams of the day forms thecrown of this structure.75When I visited the Shwedagon pagoda, I had trouble separating the past from thepresent. Occasionally I felt as if I were in the middle of an unrealscience-fiction film. First of all, you have to climb a seemingly endless pathfrom forecourt to forecourt until, finally, after hundreds of steps, you findyourself near the circular, golden centre. Here can be found rows of shrines,one next to another. Electronically controlled miniature lamps behind theBuddha-heads allow rings and beams of light to shoot out of the Buddha's brain.Rings and bundles of rays also appear to tear towards the Buddha from outerspace. The complete enlightenment. (This may sound sarcastic, but is not meantto be.) It is not very different in our Christian places of pilgrimage. The onlydifference is that you are nearly smothered by the glittering gold and diamondsin the Shwedagon pagoda. Inadvertently I was reminded of the Spanishconquistadors, who had set out for Central and South America and murdered theMaya and the Inca for their gold. Thank Heaven the European conquerors knewnothing about the land of gold called Myanmar that had existed for thousands ofyears. I dare say an incomparable culture would have been destroyed there too inthe name of the Cross.I spent hours strolling through the Shwedagon pagoda and often found itdifficult to tear my gaze away from the figures. There stood the statues,covered in layers of indefinable gold and silver alloys, just as if they hadsprung from the Star Wars films. Beside them were the mystical helpers, theprotectors of the Buddha, which could not have existed in the lifetime of thelast Buddha. This is mythology cast in gold and silver, non-rusting for eternityand a unique pictorial lesson. Naturally, the dragon motif is not missingeither.The top terrace is covered in white marble slabs. In the middle, the goldenstupa rears up with a circumference of 433 metres. The stupa itself lies on anoctagonal plate on the ground, with eight smaller stupas standing at each of theeight corners, making a total of sixty-four. In front of these are somesphinx-like fabulous beasts, pure mythology. The stupa, which is about 100metres tall, rises into the sky like a glowing finger pointing at the universe,surrounded by diamonds shooting coloured flashes of light. Right at the top is asmall globe of heavy gold with a diameter of 25 centimetres. On the golden globeis a 76 carat emerald, which stores up energy from the first to last sunbeam.Laser technicians would find it quite inspiring.Our planetary system and the universe are present everywhere in the Shwedagonpagoda. According to Myanmaran traditions, both the Sun and the Moon are thoughtof as spheres.76 This is why there is a solar devotion area, to which areassigned Sunday and the divine bird Garuda. Monday and the tiger are assigned tothe lunar devotion space. Every planet has its days and animals. Accordingly,there is a space for the worship of each planet in the Shwedagon pagoda, asfollows: * Mars corresponds with Tuesday. The animal is the lion. * Venus corresponds with Friday. The animal is the guinea pig. * Jupiter corresponds with Thursday. The animal is the rat. * Saturn corresponds with Saturday. The animal is a mythological serpent being (naga). * Mercury corresponds with Wednesday. The animal is the elephant.Then, there are places of worship for the unknown planet, for the eight days ofthe week, and for the Sakka kings, who originated from the celestial fields ofMount Meru. As all Myanmarans are already connected with the days of the weekand with the planets through their personal names, the worshippers will worshipat those shrines assigned to them: those called Tuesday at the shrine of Mars,those with a Thursday name at the Jupiter shrine, and so on. Naturally, theMyanmarans also have their own calendar. The week consists of eight days, andthe year 1999, when I visited that country, corresponded to the year 1361 inMyanmar.Just as miracles occur at Christian places of pilgrimage, they happen here too.Certain parts of the Shwedagon pagoda are specially reserved for miracles. Here,the believers pray particularly fervently and plead for relief in this and thenext life. The believers bow in front of the 'Stone of Fulfilling Wishes,' liftup the stone and say, 'May this stone become light if my wish is fulfilled.' ifthe stone remains heavy, as it is, the miracle will have to wait, or the wishwill remain unfulfilled for reasons of divine providence. Many miracles haveoccurred in this and other pagodas all over the country. And who is responsiblefor them? The Great Spirit of the Universe? IT, which is around us and in us,and of which we are a microscopic part? There is even a raised platform in theShwedagon pagoda, which is exclusively reserved for men. Here too miracleshappen.It was evening. The gold of the pagoda was glowing a shiny dark yellow. At thetop, on the point of the stupa, sparkled the emerald. Suddenly, a team of peopleturned up on the marble platform, each one carrying a broom. At a command, theteam moved slowly around the temple platform, and here and there, a little pileof dirt appeared, which was then removed by a second team with a waste bin. Iheard that the ladies and gentlemen did this job voluntarily, but only thosewhose birthday is on that particular day are allowed to do the work.This is how things work with the Myanmarans. Astrology determines life frombirth to the sound of the gong at death, and then on, into the next round.There is a tradition about the original creation of the Shwedagon pagoda, whichgoes back much further than Buddhism. But what is this Buddhism really?In ancient Indian, the word Buddha means the 'Enlightened One.' The Buddha'sreal name was Siddharta, which in Sanskrit means, 'one who has attained hisgoal.' Buddha's birth year is set at approximately 560 BC. He came from thenoble family of the Sakajas and grew up in his father's splendid palace in thefoothills of the Nepalese Himalayas. In keeping with the custom of Indian noblehouses, in which a name from the holy scriptures (the Vedas) is chosen, hispersonal name was Gotama (Gautama). When he was 29 years old, he found he hadhad enough of his boring, useless, luxurious life. He left his home, wanderedaround like a beggar, and practised meditation for many years. He was seeking anew way to give meaning to life. When exactly this all happened, nobody knows.One day, while sitting under a bodhi tree in Bodhgaya, the universe openeditself to him; the day of enlightenment had arrived. Suddenly, he felt himselfto be an incarnation of a celestial being. He began to preach, attracteddisciples, and praised the path of enlightenment, which all flesh would have towalk. He founded the order of monks called Sangha, wandered through northernIndia and died at the Nepalese border.Buddha himself---like Jesus---left no writing. His sermons were recorded by hisdisciples and were spread by them. Buddha taught the 'four truths,' the path onwhich every human being could become an enlightened being. In this, Buddhaassumed the existence of previous and future Buddhas (Enlightened Ones). In hisdeparture speeches, in the Mahaparinibbana-Sutta, he spoke of future Buddhas.One of them, he announced, would appear at a time in which India wasoverpopulated with human beings. The villages and towns would be as denselyinhabited as chicken runs. There would be 84,000 towns in the whole of India. AKing called Sankha would live in the city Ketumati (present-day Benares), and hewould rule the whole world, not with violence but with justice. Under his rule,the exalted Metteya (also called Maitreya) would appear on Earth. Metteya wouldbe an extraordinary and unique 'chariot driver and knower of the world,' ateacher of gods and humans, the Perfect Buddha in fact.In contrast to Christianity, according to which the religious founder was madeinto a god, Buddha is not a deity. The believers do not pray to him directly,but they wish to attain enlightenment and help via Buddha's teaching and spirit.During the course of 2,500 years the most diverse Buddhist schools have arisen.Each school refers back to traditions of the original Buddha's disciples and toknowledge arrived at through enlightenment. But they are all agreed on the mainpoints.The Buddhist Myanmarans believe the holy Mount Meru is situated at the centre ofthe world. Seven seas surround it, and there, various different levels of beingare to be found. There is, for example, a kingdom of the senses, a realm ofshapelessness and a realm of the finest matter. In total, 31 levels of beingexist that lead far beyond Mount Meru and into the universe. Out there,innumerable worlds and heavens exist, which are supposed to be far distant fromeach other. Even the galaxies come and go. At present, there are supposed to be10,100,000 universes like ours, in which there is life of all kinds.According to Buddhist ideas in Myanmar, a new Buddha will appear every 5,000years. Now, the legend of the Shwedagon pagoda says that the hill on which thisshrine was later built had been a holy place for a long time before, as relicsof an even earlier Buddha had been preserved here. These relics consisted of anarticle of clothing, a ladle and a staff. Five thousand years had passed, and aKing called Okkapala was now waiting for the new Buddha. This was at a time whenthe present Buddha was still a youth living in the luxury palace of his parents.The millennium had almost passed when the present Buddha had his moment ofenlightenment under the bodhi tree in Bodhgaya and appeared to King Okkapala inthe precise spot in Myanmar where the Shwedagon pagoda stands today. WhereasChristianity has its church towers and steeples and Islam its minarets, Buddhismhas its stupas. A stupa has many meanings for a Buddhist; it can be seen as asymbol for the end of life's journey; it may be a tomb, or the centre ofcreative power. With its division into three parts, the stupa mirrors thetripartite nature of Buddhism, through the base, the dome and the tower. Thenumber three in Buddhism is looked upon as the characteristic dimensions ofspace. The stupa is also seen as the 'means of travelling to the world of thegods,' which is why a Buddha performing ritual hand movements sits inside somany stupas. Originally, the stupa is only supposed to have had the shape ofhalf an egg with a mast on top. The great teachers or masters came out of theegg, but the stupa is also a symbol of the cosmos, and its shape symbolizes theworld mountain Meru. As an old globetrotter and worker 'in the vineyard of theLord' I was at once alerted to a parallel in a continent not so far removed,while studying the stupas. A short detour will presently bring me back to thestupas.South America: in the Sierra Nevada of Santa Marta in Colombia there once livedthe tribe of the Kogi (or Kagaba) Indians, who were almost exterminated by theSpaniards in the 16th century. Only a few survived. Their towns, which hadmeanwhile become totally overgrown by the jungle, were not rediscovered againuntil the 20th century, when they were partially excavated. The first Europeanresearcher to make an effort to find out more about the Kogi Indians was theAustrian professor Theodor Preuss.77 Preuss found out that the Kogi ascribed thecreation to a great original mother called Gauteovan. She was the ancestor ofthe four original priests, the progenitors of the priestly house. The home ofthese original priests was somewhere in outer space, and their laws arrived withthe Kogi 'from outside.' When the original priests came to Earth they woremasks, which they did not take off until much later. The priests passed on theiroffice to their sons. They were educated in temples for a novice period lastingnine years,so that the knowledge of the fathers could be passed on from onegeneration to the next without being influenced. This education took place innine years of darkness. Kogi mythology tells of battles with four originalpriests against demons and animals. Lightning bolts were hurled, there was a lotof flying about in all directions, and the seeds of various plants were broughtto Earth. Masks were worn by the gods, one of which was hidden inside a hill ormountain. A long time passed; the Earth brought forth humans with unnaturaltendencies, who used all species of animals for sexual intercourse. The topchieftain had thereupon opened the portals of Heaven and allowed it to rain forfour years. The priests had built a magic ship and gathered all species ofanimals and birds, and also plants and seeds, inside it. For four long yearsthere was red and blue rain, and all over the world huge lakes were created.Finally, the magic ship had become stranded on the crest of the Sierra Negra(which is the name it still had in the Kogi legend). 'Now all the evil ones hadbeen destroyed, and the priests, the older brothers, all came down from Heaven,whereupon Mulkueikai [a priest] opened the door and placed all the birds andfour-footed creatures, all the trees and plants on Earth. This was performed byall the divine persons called Father Kalgusiza. They left behind a monument inmemory of this in all the temples.'77This is strange. The Kogi legends speak of sodomy. This also happened inGenesis, chapter 19, before the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. 'All camedown from Heaven' we are told by the Kogi myth. The Sumerian king-list says,'After the Flood had passed, kingship once more descended from Heaven.' And ifanybody were now to believe that the Spaniards had brought this knowledge toColombia, he or she would be very mistaken, as the Kogi myth existed long beforethe Spaniards came, and the Sumerian king-list was not discovered until the 19thcentury. So what has any of this to do with the stupas in Asia?Professor Dr Reichel-Dolmatoff was the most knowledgeable expert on the Kogiculture, which he studied for many years. Reichel-Dolmatoff discovered that allthe Kogi structures had the shape of stupas and can only be understood inconnection with events in space. The Kogis perceived the cosmos as an egg-shapedspace determined by seven points: north, south, east, west, the zenith, thenadir (opposite the zenith) and the centre. Within the space defined in thisway, there are nine levels---nine worlds---of which the middle one, the fifth,is represented by our world. All Kogi houses are built according to thispattern. All of them are at the same time models of the Kogi cosmos.Four levels lie below the surface of the Earth, humans exist on the fifth, and afurther four lie above. This produces the shape of an egg, in which the fourlevels above humans are formed by the stupa. A mighty post protrudes through theroof of the stupa of the men's house, like a flag pole aimed at the sky.Diagonally opposite is the women's house with two cross-beams protruding fromthe stupa roof. Year after year, on 21 March (at the beginning of spring) thepost on the roof of the men's house throws a long shadow into the shadow of thecrossed beams of the women's house. The two shadows become one. The phalluspenetrates the vagina, a symbol of spring, and the seed is to be sown in theearth.All the Kogi structures lay in terraces above each other like the pagodas inMyanmar. The largest Kogi town that I visited 20 years ago79 is calledBurritaca. Admittedly, I have not so far discovered any connection between thestructures and the knowledge of the Kogi in Colombia and that of the earlypeoples in Asia, but the line is evident.The bell-shape of the stupas is much older than the current era of Buddhism. Itcan come as little surprise, then, to hear that, according to Buddhisttraditions, several Buddhas were on earth before the last Buddha. After all, anew one is supposed to grace us with his presence every 5,000 years. Centuriesbefore the enlightenment of the last Buddha, the Jainist religion prevailed inthe entire Indian sub-continent. Followers of Jainism maintain in their textsthat the foundation of their religion dates back to a time several hundreds ofthousands of years ago and that their knowledge originally came from divinebeings. (I have discussed this in a previous book.39)What is left is the stupa, a bell-shaped structure striving towards the sky,which existed long before the present Buddhism. And Myanmar is the culminationpoint for all the stupas, a land with 'entire forests of stupas.' Just in thevicinity of Bagan, a town on the Ayeyarwady, there are more than 2,000 of them.Often, they are found standing densely packed together, in different sizes. Someare more than 2,000 years old. Some of the smaller ones look old and arebeginning to decay; others originated in the previous centuries and areconstantly being renovated. Over about 200 years, from 1075 to 1287, some 13,000temples, pagodas and stupas were erected in the plain of Bagan. 'Nowhere else isthere such an impressive view, as that of the sight of the Plain of Bagan---onebrick-red pagoda next to the other, occasionally with a white top, which rear upto the sky out of the hazy distance on the banks of the greatest river ofMyanmar.'75On the way to the most splendid structures of Bagan, the Ananda Temple and theShwesandaw pagoda, I came past some market stalls, where I kept noticing roundcake tins filled with folded-up green leaves. The indigenous population stuffedthe leaves into their mouths and then spat out a red liquid. What were theychewing? My first thought was that it was kat, a drug that is mainly consumed inYemen. Then I also remembered the coca leaves in Peru and Ecuador. In fact, thefolded-up green leaves that grow on the areca palm were the national drug of theMyanmarans. Their land is where the betel nut thrives---a small palm nut with avery hard shell, comparable to a nutmeg, and which looks very similar inside.The Myanmarans chop up the nuts, lay them on the betel leaves, which look verymuch like the leaves of the pepper plant, then smear lime and various spices onit. The whole thing is folded into a little package and shoved straight intoone's mouth. The tanning substances in the leaves stimulate a strong productionof saliva, which is then coloured red by the betel nuts. I tried it but soonspat out the red juice.As at the Shwedagon pagoda in Yangon, in the Ananda Temple in Bagan, there aremany steps, which lead up to the top. The original structure was built by theMon people and was finished in the year 1091, on holy ground, which is ofspecial importance according to the myths. How could it be any other way? TheGlass Palace Chronicle of the Kings of Myanmar is an historical-mythologicalhistory written down in the century before last. According to this chronicle,eight monks appeared one day in front of the palace of King Kyanzitthas. Themonks reported to the king that they had come from a distant country and hadonce lived in the Nandamula Cave. This cave had been inhabited by an earlierBuddha. The king asked the monks to show him the holy cave. Using the powers ofmeditation, the monks made the enchanted landscape appear in front of the eyesof the king, together with the Nandamula Cave. The king decided to build inMyanmar a replica of the holy grotto that was somewhere in the snow-bedeckedHimalayas. Today the Ananda Temple lies above this cave. To demonstrate theinfinite nature of Time, the four tall, golden Buddha statues in the AnandaTemple represent the four last Buddhas of the world ages: Kakusandha,Konagamana, Kassapa and Gautama. When the statues are observed from a distance,one of them seems to be smiling silently to itself, but it appears to take on aserious expression as soon as one approaches. Very cleverly contrived. Thetemple itself is an unbelievable object of sheer splendour created by a masterarchitect, and it has a giant stupa at its centre. The Buddha is present in athousand depictions, along with images of the timeless ghosts and demons fromthe pre-Buddhist period. Also in evidence are planet symbols and planet altarsof Myanmaran astrology. Whenever there is a light mist near the ground, or ahazy light, the central stupa rears its high mast into the sky, just as a Kogihouse in distant Colombia rears above the leafy roof of the jungle.In Bagan, the pagoda cosmos with its eternal circular movements is alwayspresent. Every pagoda points to different key-points of mythology, which are notjust myths for the pious Myanmaran, but represent a distant reality. Here wehave ancient memories of something that the Western world does not understand,depicted in stone. Wherever a visitor goes, he or she will come across theseimpossible depictions---but in one's imagination and in the distant past nothingis impossible. Several hairs of the Buddha are preserved as relics in theShwesandaw pagoda. The pagoda has the epithet Ganesh, actually a reference tothe Hindu elephant god. What does he have to do with the Buddha? As Buddhism istimeless, the Hindu god figures are enmeshed with Buddhism. In Hinduism, Ganeshawas one of the five foremost gods, a son of the god Shiva. He was the one whoremoved all obstacles on Earth. The word ganesha is a composite Sanskrit word.Ganas are 'the hosts,' isa is the 'Lord.' So, logically, this means 'Lord of thehosts.' He is considered to be the mediator between humans and the Almighty. InHinduism, one believes that Ganesha was not born of his parents Shiva andParvati, but was created as a brain. The divine beings had consulted beforevisiting Earth, about how they could get rid of obstacles on the new planet.Then, Shiva and Parvati thought of a being with a human body and an elephant'shead that could look in all directions and could manipulate things with itshands, feet and trunk. This offspring of the gods, which is often depicted witha halo, was a synthetic product, created from a genetic design.In 1955, all the names and characteristics attributed to Ganesha were compiledin a dissertation.80 Guide, obstacle remover, giver of success, he with thepot-belly, he with the winding trunk, and so on. Like a robot, he is posted infront of doors and entrances, where he will confront anyone who has beenforbidden to enter. In India, you meet him everywhere you go. If a Hindu buildsa house, he first places a Ganesha picture on the building site; he is meant toremove any expected obstacles. If a Hindu writes a book, he first hails Ganesha.Hello, Ganesha! Welcome! Ganesha is also prayed to at the beginning of a journeyand is therefore placed at the entrance to Indian railway stations. Soeverything has its order, all is neat and tidy. And nobody notices that ancientwisdom is at the root of it all, misunderstood for thousands of years, yet ithas survived through religion.Myanmar was closed to tourism until a few years ago, when the militarygovernment needed foreign currency and opened up the country. Today, there is anorganized tourist industry and there are hotels of all categories. A luxury shipwith air-conditioned cabins and sumptuous buffets floats on the Ayeyarwadyriver, which must seem like a space ship from another world to the simpleinhabitants along the river. The ship is called the 'Road to Mandalay' andalways begins its journey of several days on a Sunday, the day of the Sun,dedicated to the divine bird Garuda.Everywhere in Myanmar, one comes across freshly bathed monks and youths inred-and-orange robes, as every Buddhist in Myanmar has to serve for a period ina monastery. One gets the impression that people here do not walknormally---they seem to float. The upper part of the body is almost motionless,making the people seem as though they are moving along on rollers; this isparticularly true of the graceful women who carry heavy loads on their heads.And every morning the cars are adorned with flowers, for their scent.The pagoda and stupa cosmos haunts the whole country. On Sundays, Garudareigns---the king of birds, according to the Indian traditions. He is depictedwith the wings and beak of an eagle, and sometimes has a dragon's face and ahuman body. He serves the god Vishnu as a mount and has many notable features.Garuda was highly intelligent, he acted independently, and even won battlesalone. The names of his parents are also known: they were called Kasyata andVinata. Once, Mother Vinata laid an egg, out of which Garuda hatched. It allbegan normally, or so it seems.Garuda's face was white, his body was red and his wings were gold coloured. Hewould have cut a dash in any ornithological work. But when Garuda lifted hiswings, the Earth shook. He also undertook journeys into space. Moreover, hehated serpents. But he had some good reasons for this last little quirk.His mother Vinata had been kept captive by serpents after having lost a bet. Theserpents promised to release Mummy if her son would fetch them a dish full ofthe food of the gods, which makes one immortal. The crafty Garuda left no stoneunturned to fulfil this condition, but annoyingly the food of the gods that madeyou immortal could only be obtained from the middle of a sea of flame. At this,the clever Garuda filled up his golden body to bursting with water which he hadsucked up out of the nearby rivers. Then he doused the sea of flames. But---ohhorror---the divine mountain teemed with even more serpents, which all spatfire. Then Garuda whirled up clouds of dust, causing the serpents to lose theirbearings. Finally, he threw 'divine eggs' among the nest of serpents and torethem into a thousand pieces. Some of them, who came too close to him, had theirtongues slit. Understandable.Immediately after his mother had been released, Garuda took off for the Moon.But the Moon was in the possession of foreign gods who would not give himpermission to land. They shot off flaming arrows at Garuda, but he was immune tothem. Garuda's body was invulnerable. When the Moon gods realized this fact,they offered a compromise. Garuda was to receive immortality and become themount of the god Vishnu. Since then, Vishnu (Sanskrit: the good, the gentle)haunts the universe with the immortal and invincible Garuda.Just a silly, unimportant story? The tale is very old, and contains some reallyquite Utopian elements: invulnerability, bomb attacks, a flight to the Moon,even the god Vishnu himself requires a space vehicle. In Myanmar, children aretaught these stories---not as pretty fairy tales, but as part of anot-understood truth that once happened somewhere at some time. All thesestories belong to religion. Even the origins of our word 'religion' aredisputed. It can be derived from the Latin relegere (to observe carefully) orfrom religare (to be connected to God). Religion is supposed to preserve thatwhich is old. This is what happens in Buddhism and Hinduism. The intent is'carefully to observe something connected to God' and preserve it, even if onedoes not understand it. One can demonstrate that these religious stories havebeen eternalized in temples and figures. It is, of course, no different in thewestern world, even though we may dispute it. Whoever has visited one of thebeautiful Gothic or Baroque cathedrals will know what I mean. There we findsplendid depictions of Saint Michael fighting a dragon; representations ofsaints ascending to Heaven; of youths sitting in fiery furnaces without beingharmed; of Moses speaking to a burning bush; of animals reverently listening toSaint Anthony; of angels flying from Heaven to Earth and back again; of flamingswords being manipulated by angels; of objects shooting out beams of light (theark of the covenant; monstrances); of a Devil with horns and a glowing trident;of Jesus walking on water; and of heavenly hosts, who live in space. We maintainthat this is all more or less artistic depiction of things that were oncethought to be truth. Buddhists and Hindus think nothing different. The firmbelief in these former truths is not only represented in the cultural field of areligion, it may also contain ancient knowledge (in contrast to belief). Oneexample of this is given in Peter Fiebag's book, Geheimnisse der Naturvölker(Secrets of Native Peoples).81Fiebag, who was a secondary school teacher, was also a traveller and researcher,a globetrotter and writer. Some years ago, he visited the island of Sulawesi(Indonesia) and there went to the highlands inhabited by the tribe of theToraja. There, he soon discovered that the Toraja people look upon themselves as'children of the stars.' Attentively, Fiebag began to study the unbelievabletraditions of this tribe. The Toraja assured him that their ancient ancestorshad come from outer space in the dim and distant past. They still manifest thesebeliefs to this day---in their religion, in certain words, and even in theirhomes. The Toraja call their religion 'manurun di langi'---'that which came downfrom Heaven' or 'it came down from Heaven.' Even the shapes of their houses aresupposed to resemble the objects with which the ancient ancestors came from theuniverse. Fiebag describes: 'The house is interpreted cosmologically and is notsung about as a ship. The roof of the house is associated with a bird and withflying. Symbolically it stands for space, outer space. A \"katik\", a long-neckedheavenly bird from Toraja mythology, is sticking out of the buffalo's head abovethe entrance area; this confirms the symbolic expression. The sun wheel is afurther symbol of space, just as is the cockerel in the gable area, whose headis associated with the constellation of the Pleiades and whose body is connectedwith Orion and Sirius . . . A student of languages and native of Toraja, ArminAchsin, has formulated it thus: \"The Tongkonan house symbolises the universe.The roof represents the sky and is connected in the mind with the universe. Thecentral pillar . . . connects the earth and the sky.\"' The Kogi Indians inColombia send their regards.Fiebag heard that the original ancestor of the Toraja, Tamboro-langi, hadreached Earth in a 'structure made of iron,' a 'house that swung down.' He founda wife, and several times switched his residence between the Earth and hisheavenly home. One day, he became furious and destroyed the 'heavenly stair.''As he wished to visit the Earth once more, he came flying to Earth with hisheavenly house from the stars. He landed on the mountains of Ullin, inTana-Toraja, not far from Rantepao. In this way, the Toraja houses were replicasof a star ship that Tamboro-langi once brought to Earth from the Pleiades.'81This is not just a fairy tale-like story, but knowledge possessed by a tribestill living to this day. It is demonstrated in their names and buildings.Houses in the heavens? Nothing but fantastic embroidery? I would recommend toany tourist travelling to Thailand, for whatever reasons, to visit the publiclyaccessible parts of the royal palace in Bangkok. You can see images of thehistory of the Thai monarchy in a wonderful picture gallery there. You will findpictures of entire houses and palaces that fly through the clouds. In the Templeof the Emerald Buddha, you will see a pictorial representation of the Ramakian.The Ramakian is the Thai version of the Indian Ramayana epic. Stories from theRamayana are illustrated in full colour on 178 sections. The observer will seegods with unearthly weapons depicted there. Not a few of the divine figures aremoving about in the air and are firing their death-dealing ray-guns from theclouds.The gods of the Asiatic world employed terrible weapons. Some of them are knowntoday, others are in a Utopian realm even for us. I shall examine this subjectfurther in the next chapter."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 4: Weapons of the Gods[The_Gods_Were_Astronauts_split_001.html#filepos1634] \"He who insists on his rank, has already lost it.\"---MAX RYCHNER CAN you imagine a weapon that returns to the attacker like a boomerang, butconsists of a gleaming flame? A weapon that evaporates waters and envelopes theentire planet in water vapour? A weapon that will instantaneously put an enemyarmy to sleep? A weapon that will create 'illusions' so that the enemy attacksand shoots at something that does not exist? A weapon that is capable of tearingapart an entire planet? A weapon that makes the attacker, together with itstechnology, quite invisible? A weapon that can be deployed from outer space toburn up entire countries? Can you imagine habitats in space that are so vastthat thousands of people can live in them? Habitats with their own gardens,fields, running water and all kinds of facilities that function according tosome anti-gravitation principle and can attain unbelievable speeds of travel?Can you imagine such futuristic things? Perhaps in a thousand years' time? Wellnow, all these things and more have already existed: this we know---if we careto. Where? In ancient Indian literature. For hundreds of years, really sinceWestern powers took over India, we have looked on the ancient Indian traditionswith a snooty attitude as something airy-fairy derived from the imagination.Clever scholars have translated the great Indian epics into English and French,always with an arrogant attitude according to which no science exists outsidethe Western kind. As usual---and I am fed up with writing aboutit---psychologists and theologians have pounced on the old texts and falsifiedand twisted just about everything; not out of bad intentions, but out of lack ofunderstanding. The time was not yet ripe.Times have changed. The Indian Sanskrit scholars have awoken from their'Sleeping Beauty' sleep and have begun to examine their own epics, vedas andancient texts under a magnifying glass, so to speak; they are looking at themarmed with the knowledge of our times. Ever more texts were added, the mountainof information has grown, and the Western experts on Indian studies aremeanwhile looking on aghast. In ancient India, they were not creatingscience-fiction stories, not speculating on fabulous weapons, or imaginingspaceships---all of this was once a reality. We can no longer avoid thisrealization, and those India experts who still do not understand should leavetheir teaching positions.Let us start with some simple things. In the Vymaanika-Shaastra, an ancientcollection of different texts, the following technologies are described:82 * a type of mirror that can be used to attract or draw in energy; * a device that allows a flying vehicle to be enlarged or reduced at will during flight; * a device for storing radiating energy; * an instrument that can measure the intensity of lightning; * an apparatus for prospecting the most diverse natural resources under the surface of the planet (minerals, ores, gold, and so on); * a device that can turn bright daylight into darkness; * a device that can neutralize wind pressure; * a sonic canon; * twelve different types of electricity; * an apparatus that can be used to capture pictures and conversations from flying enemy vehicles; * a machine that can tap solar energy; * an apparatus to stop the movement of an enemy flying machine; * a gadget that can make your own flying vehicle invisible; * crystals that produce energy; * an apparatus that repulses chemical and biological substances used as weapons; * a protective shield around one's own machine; * several types of metal that repulse heat; * motors for flying machines, the energy for which is derived from quicksilver (mercury); * indescribable alloys that we do not understand yet, because the Sanskrit words are untranslatable.Sanskrit scholar Professor Dr Kanjilal cites the following old sources thatreport on terrible weapons, various kinds of flying vehicles and spaceships:83 * The Vymaanika-Shaastra * The Samarangana Sutradhara * The Yuktikalpataru * The Mayamatam * The Ayurveda Rigveda * The Mahabharata * The Ramayana * The Puranas * The Bhagavata * The Raghuvamsam * The Abimaraka of Bhsa * The Jatakas * The Avadana literature * The Kathasaritsagara * The Yuktikalpataru of BhojaThese unpronounceable words are only understood by Sanskrit scholars, but theyof all people should know where to find the texts about futuristic visions inthe deep past. The first translations of texts describing unbelievable eventsappeared in India in 1968 under the editorship of Swami Brahamuni Parivrajaha,followed in 1973 by the next publication by the Academy of Sanskrit Research inMysore. This Mysore edition of the Vymaanika-Shaastra contains a running Englishtranslation but no commentary. The Hindi edition, on the other hand, contains anintroduction, which tells us that the original of the Vymaanika-Shaastra hadbeen found as early as 1918 in the Baroda Royal Sanskrit Library. (A copy ofthis text that was photo-graphed and dated 19 August 1919 is kept in PoonaCollege. Keyword: Venkatachalam Sarma.)Chapter XXXI of the Samarangana Sutradhara contains many details about theconstruction of flying machines. Even if some of these works have only appearedin our times, without exception they all refer back to very ancient Indiantexts. The Hindi edition of the Vymaanika-Shaastra refers to 97 old Indian textsthat deal with flying apparatuses, the Yuktikal-pataru of Bhoja mentions flyingvehicles in verses 48 to 50. The oldest translation originates from 1870, whenthe Western world had no idea of aeroplanes, let alone spaceships.The first reference to flying apparatuses, which fly through space with livingpeople on board---and also with gods---appears in the hymns to the Asvinas twinsand the demi-gods Rbhus. This is in the Rigveda. The Vedas (ancient Indianveda---knowledge) comprise the oldest religious literature of the Indians.Ancient Indian, a language in which the Vedas are compiled, is considerablyolder than the later Sanskrit literature. The Vedas are a collection of oldscriptures that were considered to be 'superhuman' and inspired. There are atotal of four great blocks of the Vedas. The 1,028 hymns of the Rigveda areaddressed to individual gods. Then there is the old Indian national epic, theMahabharata, with approximately 160,000 verses. It is probably the mostvoluminous poem of any people. The Ramayana consists of another 24,000 shlokas(an Indian rhyme meter consisting of double lines of verse). Last but not least,there are the Puranas. I will list them here at this point, so that thelayperson may appreciate the sheer volume of this unbelievable mass ofliterature at our disposal: * Vishnu Purana, 23,000 verses * Naradiya Purana, 25,000 verses * Padma Purana, 55,000 verses * Garuda Purana, 19,000 verses * Varaha Purana, 18,000 verses * Bhagavata Purana, 18,000 verses * Brahmanda Purana, 12,000 verses * Brahmavaivarta Purana, 18,000 verses * Markandeya Purana, 9,000 verses * Bhavisya Purana, 14,500 verses * Vamana Purana, 10,000 verses * Brahma Purana, 10,000 verses * Matsya Purana, 14,000 verses * Kurma Purana, 17,000 verses * Linga Purana, 10,000 verses * Shiva Purana, 24,000 verses * Skanda Purana, 81,000 verses * Agni Purana, 15,400 versesIf one adds the Mahabharata and the Ramayana to these, we have a total of560,000 verses! Yes, the ancient Indian literature is very voluminous. No otherpeople in the world possesses such mighty traditions---compared with this greattorrent of information, our Old Testament dwindles to a mere trickle. Now, theseancient Indian texts were always there, even if they were partly hidden away inmonasteries and cellars. But why has it taken until now to search these textsfor flying devices and spaceships?The translators in the 19th and 20th centuries were befogged with the spirit oftheir own times. if the Ramayana, for example, spoke of a flying chariot, 'thatmade the mountains tremble, took off with a noise like thunder, and burntforests, meadows and the tops of buildings,' the translator would insert thefollowing type of comment: 'There can be no doubt that this can only refer to atropical storm.'84 The scholar of 1884 could not make sense of it in any otherway; his was an orderly world. Annoyingly, this attitude haunts the entireWestern literature that deals with ancient India. Atrocious! German ProfessorHermann Jacobi translated the Ramayana in 1893. He did not do this tidily, verseby verse, but simply left out entire complexes that he considered to besuperfluous. Full of arrogance, he annotated passages with comments like'meaningless chatter' or 'this passage can be left out, as it contains sheerfantasy.'85Searching in the excellent collections of the Bern City and University Library,I found countless volumes about ancient Indian literature, about Indianmysticism, about Indian mythology, and reams of commentaries about theMahabharata, the Ramayana and the Vedas. But there were no direct translations.It was extremely frustrating. All the clever brains that had ever writtenany-thing about ancient India in German, must have been alpha-males: you shallnot think differently from me. They had been lulled in their own zeitgeist thatkept them happy, they suffered from professional blindness and had been'vaccinated' with the Bible. The only thing left for me was to stick with thegreat English-language translations, the translation of the Mahabharata byChandra Potrap Roy (Calcutta, 1896) and the Ramayana translation by M. Nath Dutt(Calcutta, 1891).86, 87 The other literature I used will be marked and listed inthe Notes at the end of the book.I have, so far, found only two works in the German-speaking world that havedared to look at the ancient Indian texts with modern eyes. These are theoutstandingly researched volume by India expert Lutz Gentes called DieWirklichkeit der Götter (The Reality of the Gods), and a modern interpretationof the Vedic texts in the book, Gott and Götter (God and the Gods), by Indiaexpert Armin Risi.89The principles of the construction of flying machines are explained in 230 linesin the Samarangana Sutradhara of Bhoja. They are described as being unusuallymanoeuvrable, rather like our helicopters. They can hover on the spot in theair, fly round the Earth or beyond. The descriptions are insufficient toreconstruct a copy of the vehicle now, but there was methodology in them, eventhen. The unknown author remarked, thousands of years ago, that he was not doingthis out of lack of knowledge, but to avoid misuse.Mastery of air and space was not just restricted to the chosen few in thosedays. We read:The body must be constructed so that it is strong and durable . . . Out oflightweight metal [mica is mentioned, EvD] . . . The power residing in mercury,which is set in motion by the driving force of the whirlwind, enables a humanbeing to travel great distances in the heavens in a wonderful manner. Likewise,a vimana [ancient Indian name for a flying vehicle] can be constructed, so it isas large as the temple for the 'God-in-motion.' Four strong containers formercury must be built in. When the latter are heated up by regulated fire in theiron containers, the vimana will develop the power of thunder through themercury, and it will soon appear like a pearl in the sky.83In the Vishnu Purana we read:While Kalki was still speaking, two chariots came down from Heaven before them,which shone like the sun, consisted of precious gems of all kinds, and thatmoved by themselves and were protected by shining weapons.90King Rumanvat even had a vimana the size of a jumbo jet at his disposal:Both the King and the harem personnel, but also the group of dignitaries fromeach part of the city, sat down in the celestial vehicle. They reached the greatexpanse of the sky and followed the routes of the winds. The celestial vehicleflew across the Earth, over the oceans, and was then steered towards the city ofAvantis, where a festival was being celebrated. The vimana stopped, so that theKing could take part in the festivities. After a short intermediate stop, theKing set off again watched by countless curious onlookers who admired thecelestial vehicle.91The hymns of the Rigveda, where they speak about the vimana of the two Asvinasbrothers, gives details about the flying vehicle. It was triangular, large andhad three levels ('trvrt') and was flown by three pilots ('tri bandhura'). Ithad retractable wheels and was built out of light metal that looked like gold.The fuel for this flying vehicle consisted of liquids, called 'madhu' and'anna;' no Sanskrit scholars know how to translate these words. The vimana movedmore lightly than a bird and was able to fly to the Moon and back with ease.When landing on the Earth, it would make a great noise. The Rigveda explicitlymentions different types of fuel that were kept in varied containers. Every timethe vehicle came down out of the clouds, great crowds gathered to watch thespectacle. This vehicle that was capable of space travel carried a total ofeight persons. Not bad.Three flying vehicles are mentioned in section 1.46.4 of the Rigveda. They areall capable of conducting liberation operations from the air. At least one ofthese vimanas also had amphibian features, as it was able to move about in wateras easily as in the air. There is mention of 30 rescue operations that wereconducted---rescues from the sea, from caves and even from torture chambers.Rigveda sections 1.166.4 to 5.9 describe how buildings shook, trees wereuprooted and how the echo of the noise at take-off was thrown back by the hillswhen the celestial ship lifted off. Not much different from today. In the entireclassical and purana literature of ancient India, the word vimana refers to aflying vehicle that shines in the heavens (not that ominous Heaven!) andcontains liquid substances for fuel.In spite of these very clear texts, thousands of years old, European Indiaexperts still behave as though all this did not exist, as though the texts weresimply fiction, though perhaps woven around a possibly true kernel. This kernelis believed by the experts to centre around a quarrel between two families. Theymay have existed, but do not explain the terrible weapons, nor the vimanas, letalone the cities in space.The basis for the Mahabharata (the most voluminous of the ancient Indian epics)is the battle between two royal houses. The house of the Kurus is said to havebeen generated from a king of the Moon dynasty and produced two brothers, theolder Dhritarashtra and the younger Pandu. Pandu, the younger, had the thronebecause his older brother was blind. But the blind one had still managed tobeget 100 sons: the Kauravas. Pandu, the younger one, only had five sons, thePandavas. Fate decreed that Pandu was to die while his sons were still minors.No wonder, then, that the Kauravas contrived in various devious ways to get ridof the young Pandavas. When this failed, they had to give their cousins at leastsome parts of the kingdom. This is how the family drama began.The Kauravas, way in the majority, challenged the Pandavas to a game of dice.The Panadavas lost and were forced to hand over part of their kingdom anddisappear into exile for 13 years. Inevitably, the Pandavas demanded theirkingdom back after the 13-year period of exile was over. But the Kauravas, whohad meanwhile become very powerful, refused. This was the beginning of the mostterrible war ever described in ancient literature. The Mahabharata even tells usthat all peoples on Earth had sided with either one or the other of the warringparties. The last battle took place on the field of Kurukshetra and wasconducted with extraordinary persistence. Terrible 'weapons of the gods' wereemployed, which the humans had no way of counteracting. The glorious, mightywarriors fell, one after the other. The Pandavas did not win until the 18th day,with 18 of the 'great units' of the army being massacred. According to moderncalculations, this would have been about four million people. In the end, out ofthe mighty mass of warriors who had taken part in the battle, just six peopleremained alive of those fighting on the side of the Pandavas, among them thefive sons of Pandu. Of the Kauravas only three survived the end of this war ofbrothers.This is the basic framework of the Mahabharata, the red thread so to speak. Theheroes of the war---some themselves of divine origins---kept asking theirheavenly protectors for new weapons, whenever one was threatened with defeat ina battle. And the gods heard their pleas, evidently without displaying muchsensitivity. This meant that unbelievable weapons were being used, all from thearsenal of the Celestial Ones. The latter flew around in their vimanas orenjoyed the dolce vita in gigantic space cities---while human beings bled todeath on the battlefields.For example, the hero Vasudeva begged his God Agni (God of Fire) for a newweapon, and the latter made him a present of the disc 'Charka.' This disc had ahandle made of metal in the centre and would always return to Vasudeva, even ifthe enemy had been vanquished. This is what happens in the second chapter of theMahabharata. The disc strikes down warriors and even slices off the head of awell-protected king, then flies back to Vasudeva. Uncanny.In the Pana Parva (third Book of the Mahabharata), Arjuna asks his God Shiva fora weapon. Shiva gives it to him with the following words:'I will give you my favourite weapon, Pashupata. No one, not even the highestamong the gods, knows it. You must be very careful, so that you do not use itincorrectly, because if you employ it against a weak enemy, you could destroythe whole world. There is nobody who cannot be destroyed with this weapon. Youcan fire it with a bow, or with your eye or even with the power of yourintellect.'Then Arjuna is instructed in the secrets of the use of this weapon. Shortlyafterwards, the demi-god Kuvera joins them. He gives Arjuna the weapon called'Antardhana.' This weapon has the facility instantaneously to put all enemies tosleep. A hypnosis weapon? Finally, Indra, Lord of the Heavens, appearspersonally in a celestial battle chariot and invites Arjuna to climb into theflying vehicle and to visit the celestial realms with him. The Vana Parva (partof the Mahabharata) tells that Kaurava was also invited to visit theabove-earthly realms:You need to ascend to the heavens. Prepare yourself therefore. My own celestialvehicle, with Matali as the pilot [charioteer] will soon fly to Earth. He willtake you into the celestial realms, and I promise to give you all my celestialweapons.92I have tried to translate, from English translations of the 19th century, thosepassages that are unavailable in German. In doubtful cases, where severaloptions exist, I will provide the English original text. The following passageoriginates from division XLII of the Vana Parva that carries the titleIndralokagamana Parva (part of the Mahabharata):And while Gudakesha, equipped with great intelligence, was still considering,the vehicle, equipped with mighty superiority and driven by Matali, appearedfrom the clouds. It lit up the entire firmament and filled the area with greatnoise, like thunder. Missiles of terrible kind and . . . winged darts ofcelestial splendour and lights of shining splendour, as well as lightning boltsand 'tutagudas' [untranslatable], equipped with wheels, and they worked onatmospheric expansion and created noise like the thunder from many clouds---allthis was part of the flying vehicle. And the celestial vehicles had wild 'nagas'[untranslatable, probably something serpent-like], with hot openings . . . Andthe celestial vehicle lifted off as if drawn by a thousand golden horses andquickly attained the speed of the wind. Very quickly, however, the celestialvehicle attained such a speed through its own integral power, that the eye couldhardly mark its progress. And Arjuna saw a kind of 'flag-staff,' called'Vaijayanta' on the celestial vehicle, and of a shining gleam that resembles thecolour of a dark emerald and was equipped with golden, shining ornaments . . .Arjuna said, 'O Matali, Wonderful One, how you drive this celestial vehiclewithout losing time, as if hundreds of horses were united with the power. Evenkings with all their great wealth . . . are not in a position to drive thiscelestial vehicle . . .' And Arjuna drove upwards with the magic object, thesun-like chariot, the celestial vehicle, he the wise offspring of Kuru'sgeneration. The celestial vehicle moved with extraordinary speed and rapidlybecame invisible to the mortals on the Earth.Division XLIII:And the celestial city of Indra, where Arjuna arrived, was enchanting and also aplace of recuperation for 'siddhas' and 'charanas' . . . And Arjuna saw thecelestial gardens in which heavenly music could be heard. And then, up high,where the sun no longer shines, nor the moon, where fire no longer glows, butwhere everything shines with its own light, Arjuna saw other celestial vehicles,thousands of them, that were capable of movement anywhere at will, stationed intheir proper places. Then he noticed ten thousand of these vehicles that weremoving in all directions. What is seen as stars from Earth, looking like lampsbecause of the great distance, are in reality enormous bodies.92In this fantastical story, which took place thousands of years ago somewhere inspace, it is further reported that Arjuna visits all departments of this spacehabitat and is shown tests of the most diverse weapons of the Celestial Beings.He himself has to learn to control these terrible weapons. The trainingprogramme, in the midst of the luxury of the celestial beings, lasts for a fullfive years. Arjuna was even instructed in the use of musical instruments thatwere only for the use of the celestial ones and 'did not exist in the world ofhumans.'This all sounds like fairy tales, but it is not. Real things are being describedhere. I remember conversations in which it was said, again and again, thathumans just have this desire for an ultimate weapon if they are hard pressed.Maybe. But not weapons that would have had no place in the world of Stone Ageman, such as hypnosis weapons.It has been objected that humans simply observed the birds, peacefully flyingcircles in the air, and humans just have this desire to copy the birds. Great.But birds do not make a hideous noise and do not cause hills and valleys totremble. Birds do not need pilots who require special training on top ofeverything else. Birds also do not dispose of motors with some kind of mercurydrive. And birds certainly do not fly into outer space.Arjuna, the hero of the Mahabharata, was definitely there, and not in a land ofdreams. Finally, there is a description of neither the Sun nor the Moon shining,but everything shining in its own light. We hear that thousands of other flyingvehicles were parked up there, and because of the great distance from Earth,they looked like lamps, but were, in reality, huge bodies.No, my dear friends of the other faculty, we will get no further with psychologyor humbug. People on Earth, staring at the sky, would be more likely to thinkthat the Sun shines even more brightly up there than on the Earth. But theopposite is the case: it is dark in space. You do not dream that up. Whoevernegates the description of space cities, space vehicles, shuttles and thousandsof flying vehicles in the Mahabharata, just does not want it to be true becauseit does not fit into his or her concept of the world.The notion that there never could have been a space vehicle in the dim anddistant past actually contradicts the rules of evolution, according to which wehumans have gone through a similar development. But if evolution turns out to bea continuous process, I would like an explanation for all the strangedescriptions of celestial vehicles suddenly appearing all over the world in theold books. Why did our ancestors always report on gods who come from theheavens? Where did these, our ancestors, who had just said goodbye to the StoneAge, get the construction drawings for the described celestial vehicles? Wheredid they get knowledge about the alloys used and the navigation instruments?Even the 'gods' would not have flown without instruments. These were not toykites or hot air balloons. The vimanas disposed of several storeys, were aslarge as temples and had speeds that birds could only dream of.There is not a single line in Sanskrit literature that refers to technicians,factories or test flights. The celestial vehicles were suddenly there. Godscreated them and flew them. Inno-vations, planning and execution did not happenon our planet. There was no evolution of these things, nothing that could bedeveloped step by step. If we had had such technology, humankind would havelanded on Mars thousands of years ago! The flying vehicles described in theIndian texts were far ahead of our present technology. They could fly around theEarth, reach the Moon quite easily, stand still in space, when and where theywanted, and they had energies at their disposal that we cannot even imagine.Already 40 years ago, Loren Eiseley, Professor of Anthro-pology at theUniversity of Pennsylvania and researcher of evolution, realized that somethingcould not be right:We have every reason to believe that, regardless of the forces that wereinvolved in the formation of the human brain, a tough, long-drawn out battle forsurvival between several groups of human beings could not possiblyhave broughtforth the high spiritual faculties that we observe among all peoples of theEarth today. Something else, a different formation factor, must have escaped thenotice of evolution theoreticians.93Exactly so. Professor Eiseley is in good company today. More and moreanthropologists and geneticists who study the laws of genetics on a molecularbasis have noticed this too. The missing formation factor has a name: the gods.The annoying thing about this is that the new insights have barely beenbroadcast via the media, because antiquated attitudes still rule the roost inthese institutions.If one accepts the factor of 'gods' (extra-terrestrials) in just one example,the antiquated texts from outside India suddenly become clear too. Right down tothe quarrelsome and jealous God of the Old Testament. This simple insight alsothrows light on certain building technologies of prehistory. Once they areaccepted, enlightenment will occur all over the world.Steered by Matali, suddenly lighting up the sky, looking like tongues of firewithout smoke, or like a glowing meteor in the clouds, the celestial vehicleappeared.92 [Mahabharata, section CLXV, Nivata-Kavacha-yuddha Parva]Birds? Dreams? Hocus pocus?Still invisible, the Daityas began to fight with the help of illusions. And Ifought with them and used the energy of the invisible weapons . . . And when theDaityas fled and everything became visible again, hundreds of thousands ofmurdered people lay on the Earth . . . I became unsure, and Matali noticed this.When he saw how shocked I was, he said, 'O Arjuna, Arjuna! Do not be afraid. Usethe weapon of thunder and lightning.' When I heard these words, I dischargedthat favourite weapon of the king of the celestials.92 [Mahabharata, sectionCLXXII, Nivata-Kavacha-yuddha Parva]Silly fantasies? Hardly, as when the weapon was used, it shattered entiremountains and valleys, burnt forests and caused terrible destruction in theranks of the enemies.In the meantime, a different battle was taking place in the heavens. As thecelestials had now evidently taken the part of one or the other of the sides ofthe earthlings, the gods too now began to shoot each other down. In the thirdchapter of the book Sabha-parvan (part of the Mahabharata) celestial cities ofdifferent sizes are described. They are led by Indra, Brahma, Rudra, Yama,Kuvera and Varuna. These celestial cities were given the collective term sabha.They were of immense proportions and, seen from Earth, they shone like copper,gold or silver. In these cities there were foods of all kinds, as well as waterin great volumes, gardens and streams, living areas and assembly halls. Therewere giant hangars for the vimanas and, of course, for the terrible weapons. Oneof these cities that revolved around themselves was called Hiranyaoura (city ofgold) and was originally built by Brahma. Two others were called Gaganacara andKhecara. Over time, these cities became inhabited by evil beings, called'daemons' in the Mahabharata. These daemons had taken the side of the wrongparty of humans. The top god Indra appears to have taken a dim view of this,because he ordered the destruction of these celestial cities. Arjuna was giventhe task of carrying out this destruction, as he had spent five years beinginstructed in the use of the terrible weapons. He also had at his disposal thebest pilot of a spaceship, Matali. Nor was Arjuna alone, as other spaceshipswith trained fighter pilots supported him.A regular space battle took place. The daemons knew how to keep on making theirgigantic space structures invisible. They too disposed of treacherous weaponsthat they used to repulse the attacking adversaries for a while. The celestialcities of the daemons were catapulted far out into space and Arjuna waited for agood position to aim:When the three cities met in space, he shot through them with a terrible beam ofthree-fold fire. The daemons were incapable of countering this ray, which wasensouled with Yuga fire and was put together with Vishnu and Soma. While thesethree cities began to burn, Parvati rushed up to watch the spectacle.94I mentioned this battle in space in my earlier books, but this time I had aneven older translation at my disposal. All the translators from the 19th centurytranslated the passages in the same way, although none of them at their time(between 1860 and 1890) could have had the foggiest idea of celestial cities.All of them used the terms 'celestial cities in the sky' and 'the three citiescame together in the firmament.'Today, mighty space cities in which battles are fought between rival races arenothing new in TV sci-fi series. All of this is already being described inancient Indian literature. It just does not fit if we follow the usualsimplistic evolutionary thought patterns. Logically this is obvious. The samegoes for the weapons of the gods, which are used in the Mahabharata, forexample:This weapon caused fear and dismay when Kama got it out of the armaments store .. . The birds in the air put up a terrible racket, a violent storm arose,lightning flashed and thunder rolled. The weapon plunged with a great noise intothe heart of Ghatotkachas, bored through it and disappeared in the starry nightsky.Aswathama flung his most dangerous weapon 'Narayana' against the Pandava troops.It flew up in the air, thousands of darts came down like hissing serpents andfell on all sides onto the warriors. Vasudeva begged the troops to ceasefighting and to throw away their weapons because he knew that the Narayanaweapon would proceed according to a magic charm. It would kill all those whofought or wanted to fight, while it would leave unharmed those who had thrownaway their weapons.95One of the brave ones, Bhima, did not want to throw away his weapon, and hequickly became enveloped in a sea of flames. Then Arjuna stepped on thebattlefield and used the divine weapon 'Baruna.' it quenched the fire but thisonly happened, after Bhima finally threw away his weapon.We are familiar with multiple-rocket launchers today, but we do not know ofmissiles that will only attack enemies who are carrying weapons. How does thatwork? Much is possible with the gods, and in the Mahabharata, even nuclearweapons are employed:Following his command, Arjuna fired the weapons that had the power of repulsingdestruction . . . The weapons flew high in the air and flames broke out of themthat resemble the great fire that consumes the earth at the end of a worldepoch. Thousands of shooting stars fell from the sky, the animals in the watersand on land trembled with fear. The Earth shook . . . At that moment, the mostfamous sage living at the time approached, Veda Vyasa . . . he urgently advised[someone] to withdraw the weapon, which he had unleashed. If he did not do so,Arjuna would counter this weapon with his 'Brahmastra' which was infallible. Ifthings went that for, however, twelve years of drought would befall the land.Arjuna knew this and therefore, had for the well being of humankind, always heldback, so as to save them. Aswathama should, therefore, immediately withdraw hisweapon and give up his precious stone . . . Aswathama spoke, '. . .Thisinfallible weapon will even kill all unborn children . . .'This is why allthe children that were born, were dead.This is not the only passage in the Mahabharata that refers to lethal radiation.The following quote originates from the fifth book of the Mahabharata and wastranslated as early as 1891:The sun appeared to turn in a circle. Singed by the heat of the weapons, theEarth swayed in the heat. Elephants were burnt and ran wildly about, back andforth . . .The raging fire caused trees to fall in great swathes, as in a forest fire . . .horses and chariots burned, everything looked like it does after a terribleconflagration. Thousands of vehicles were destroyed, then a deep stillness cameover the Earth . . . a dreadful sight was seen. The corpses of the slain hadbeen mutilated by the terrible heat; they no longer looked like humans. We havenever before seen such a terrible weapon and have never before heard of such aweapon . . . It is like a brilliant lightning, a frightful herald of death,which has caused all the followers of the Vrishni and the Andhaka to crumble toash. The burnt out bodies were unrecognisable. The survivors found that theirhair and nails fell out.Pottery goods would break without cause, the survivingbirds turned white. Within a short time, food became toxic. The lightning sankdown and turned to fine dust.96Additional information is given in the eighth book of the Mahabharata, theMusala Parva. There you can read that Curkha, one of the gods, shot a singlemissile on the three-fold city, brighter than the Sun. The elephants roared andburned, all the birds fell from the sky, food became toxic; the warriors whowere not directly involved, threw themselves into streams and lakes, 'as all hadbeen covered in the lethal breath of the god. The unborn children died in theirmothers' wombs.'No, dear skeptics, we have to own up here. What the chroniclers of thousands ofyears ago described did not originate out of any macabre fantasies. A formerreality has been recorded here. Nobody could know anything about such dreadfulweapons before Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the Second World War. Nobody could knowthat radioactivity makes any kind of food toxic; nobody could know thatradioactivity in connection with a divine lightning strike, brighter than theSun, could kill unborn children in their mothers' wombs. Nobody could know thatremnant radioactivity could make hair and nails fall out. Why? Everything hadbeen covered with the deadly breath of the god.Traces of these weapons of the gods can still be found in theSumerian-Babylonian epic of Gilgamesh, fifth tablet:The Heavens screamed, the earth roared a response, a flash of lightning, a fireflared up, death rained down. The brightness disappeared, the fire died down.Everything that had been hit by the lightning turned to ash.And in the eighth tablet, Gilgamesh asks his dying friend Enkidu, 'Did the toxicbreath of the celestial animal hit you?'97Why should our ancestors' imagination come up with something as absurd as a birdcausing a 'toxic breath' that had a lethal effect? Why was Aswathama in theMahabharata supposed to give up his 'precious stone' and thereby withdraw aterrible weapon? What was meant by that precious stone? Some kind of commandvehicle that had been built in the weapons factories of the gods? These godswere hypocrites; from a human point of view, they could actually be labelledcriminals. They equipped their favourites with dreadful weapons of destructionand watched them exterminate each other. The humans appeared to play the partsof extras in all this. Human life appeared to have no value for the gods. Thegods had, after all, created humans; the gods ruled over life and death, like wedo over the life and death of ants. Time evidently played a minor role for thesegods. They knew that humans would multiply again---like ants. I have littlesympathy for that type of god.Nobody who has studied the ancient Indian literature can doubt that these godsused the most varied kinds of space-worthy flying vehicles. Sanskrit expertProfessor Kanjilal has pointed to 41 text passages alone in the Vana Parva (partof the Mahabharata).98 Here are the most important passages: * O you, Uparicara Vasu, the roomy flying machine will come to you. (Ch. 63, 11-16) * O you, offspring of the Kurus, that evil person came with the self-propelled flying vehicle that can move anywhere and is known as Saubhapura. (Ch. 42, 15-22) * When he had disappeared from the sight of the mortals, high up in the sky, he noticed thousands of strange flying vehicles. (Ch. 42, 30-34) * He stepped into Indra's divine favourite palace and saw thousands of flying vehicles for the gods, some that had been parked, some that were in motion. (Ch. 43, 7-12) * The groups from Maruts came in celestial flying vehicles, and Matali took me with him in his flying vehicle and showed me the other flying vehicles. (Ch. 168, 10-11) * The gods appeared in their own flying vehicles in order to watch the battle between Kripacarya and Arjuna. Even Indra, the Lord of the Heavens, appeared with his special flying object, and with him were 33 celestial beings. (Ch. 274 ff and 275 ff) * He gave him a self-propelled flying vehicle, known as Puspaka. (Ch. 207, 6-9)In the Kathasaritsagara, an Indian text collection from ancient times, a flyingvehicle is mentioned that 'never has to be refuelled' and transports people tofar-away countries beyond the sea. There, the astonished reader is told of aflying vehicle that was able to cover---non-stop---a distance of 3,200kilometres, calculated in our own terms, as well as another flying vehicle ofKing Narabahanadutta, in which 1,000 men were transported on a single flight toKausambi (Ch. 43, 21 ff).In the fifth century AD, the greatest dramatic artist and poet of India,Kalidasa, lived at the court of the Indian Gupta-kings. He adapted material fromthe Mahabharata and Ramayana in his epics and dramas, as he also did in the workcalled Raghuwamsha. The various stages of the flight of Rama to Ajodhja aredescribed in clear detail and with astonishing scientific exactitude. One readsabout the phenomenal view of the heaving oceans and the mountains under water.The flying vehicle of Rama was able to attain different altitudes sometimes itflew about in the clouds, then below the birds, and sometimes along the paths'frequented by the gods [in their vehicles]' (Ch. 13, 19). The flying vehicleflew over the entire Highland of Decan, including the Alyaban Mountains, then alake and the Godavari River, the hermitage of Agastya, as well as that ofSasabhanga, and finally the mountain called Chitrakuta. Then it went on, abovethe confluence of the rivers Ganges and Jammuna, past the capital city of theKing of Nisada, in the direction of Uttarakosala on the Saraju River. When thevehicle had landed in Uttarakosala, a crowd of people gathered. Rama, followedby his passengers, left the vehicle via a glittering stair made of metal (Ch.13, 69). After meeting the ruler of the place, Rama and his company boarded hisflying machine again via the same metal stair. The flight route, which caneasily be reconstructed today, comprised about 2,500 kilometres.The same dramatist Kalidasa also reported a journey by air in Indra's celestialvehicle that was, once again, piloted by Matali. The flying device moved throughmoist clouds, where the wheels were retracted. It climbed up to higher altitudeswhere there was no more air for breathing, but also flew so low over the denseforest foliage that the birds fled in fright. After landing, Duhsantra remarkedthat one of the passengers was surprised that the wheels had not whirled up dustand did not even touch the ground. The pilot Matali kindly explained that thishovering above the ground was thanks to the superior technology of Indra. DidIndra possess an anti-gravitation device?Kalidasa was a poet who even compiled comedies in addition to his dramas.Fantasy was his forte; it belongs to the repertoire of the poet. But evenfantasy needs stimulation. Kalidasa found this in the much older epics of theMahabharata and the Ramayana. So, what is this Ramayana?The word means 'Rama's Life.' The origins of the events are lost somewhere inancient India. The Ramayana reports on a king of the Sun dynasty, who onceinhabited Ajodhja. The king had four sons by four different women, with Rama,the eldest, far outstripping his brothers in all fields. This was why his fatherchose him as his successor. A maternal intrigue prevented this, and Rama had toleave the country for 14 years. Rama had a beautiful wife, called Sita, who waskidnapped by Rawana, the ruler of Lanka (Ceylon). (The same kind of eventprovided the impulse for the Trojan War in Greece.) Clever Rama built a bridgeto connect India with Lanka and it was later used by his troops. Rama himselffetched his beloved Sita back with the help of his flying vimanas. At last, Ramawas able to sit on the throne of his father. A happy end.The framework of the story is simple, but the technology used is ratherdramatic. Two types of flying vehicles are employed in the Ramayana: the vimanasand the rathas. The first moved extremely fast, were pointed at the front andcontained several luxurious chambers. They even had pearl-encrusted windows andall the inside chambers were laid with carpets. Most vimanas mentioned in theRamayana could transport 12 passengers. A flight between Lanka and Vasisthasramais described in some detail. Today this would correspond to a distance of about2,880 kilometres, which could be travelled within a few hours. In contrast tothe Mahabharata, in the Ramayana it is predominantly humans who pilot theseextraordinary flying vehicles, usually trained leaders of armies or kings.Trained, naturally, by the gods. It should be emphasized again that thetechnology for the construction of the vimanas came from the gods. Humans didnot invent anything. Clear distinctions are made between humans who are allowedto fly a vimana and the gods in their phenomenal celestial cities.What did these gods actually want here originally? They are supposed to havecome to Earth in very early times to study humans. What a wonderful study,considering the devastating wars they instigated! In fact the gods are supposedto have been here in even earlier times to create humans, which did not seem tohave been a great success otherwise they would not have had to kill them againsubsequently.For those sceptical students of India, but also for interested laypersons whowould like to check all this, a few flight scenes from the Ramayana follow: * Together with Khara he climbed into the flying vehicle that was adorned with jewels. It made a great noise that resembled thunder from the clouds. (Ch. 3, 35, 6-7) * You may go where you wish, I will take Sita to Lanka by air . . . so Rama and Maricha climbed into the flying vehicle that resembled a palace. (Ch. 3, 42, 7-9) * Do you scoundrel believe you can attain wealth by getting yourself this flying vehicle? (Ch. 3, 30, 12) * The flying vehicle, which had the speed of thought, appeared again in Lanka. (Ch. 4, 48, 25-37) * This is the excellent flying vehicle called Puspaka and it shines like the sun. (Ch. 4, 123, 1) * The flying object . . . rose in the air with a loud noise. (Ch. 4, 123, 1) * All the harem ladies of the monkey king quickly finished decorating and climbed into the celestial vehicle. (Ch. 4, 123, 1-55)I have already given an outline of the framework of the story. In the sectionabout 'Rama and Sita' I told how the scoundrel Rawana abducted the enchantingSita in a 'vehicle of the air that resembled the sun.' The flight took themacross high hills and forests. Neither the kidnapped Sita's cries for help norher pleas could persuade her abductor to turn back. When Rama heard about theabduction, he gave a curt, military command, 'Get out the vehicle of the air!'In the meantime, Rawana, the evil one, is already flying above the ocean in thedirection of Lanka. But Rama's flying vehicle is faster. He catches up withRawana and challenges him to an aerial battle. He shoots down the abductionvehicle with a 'celestial dart' and it plunges into the ocean. Sita is rescuedand climbs into the celestial vehicle belonging to her husband, who climbs highup into a cumulus cloud with a mighty racket.Rama, the hero of the Ramayana, had clever allies. One of these gifted comradeswas the king of the monkeys called Hanuman. The king of the monkeys was able totransform himself into a giant or a midget at will. He was also a daredevilpilot. When he began his flight from the mountains, the tops of the rocks brokeoff, giant trees were toppled and the mountains vibrated. Birds and animals fledin terror to their deepest retreats. Sometimes this daredevil pilot would startoff from a city. Then the ponds and lakes would overflow and the vimana would'lift off with its burning tail above the roofs and start great fires, so thatthe buildings and all the towers would collapse and the pleasure gardens weredevastated.'Truly, a terrible flying vehicle. But then it did originate from the workshopsof the gods and they really did not care a fig about the destroyed houses ofhuman beings. Whenever I read in the Indian texts that flying vehicles hadstarted great fires, ruined gardens and toppled towers, I always think of theKebra Negest, the book of the Ethiopian Kings.99 In this book, Baina-lehkem, ason of King Solomon, had flown across Egypt, en route from Jerusalem toEthiopia. The Egyptians complained that the flying vehicle had caused statues ofthe gods and obelisks to fall down ('. . . because they drove a vehicle like theangels, and they were faster than the eagles in the sky').The holy (less today) writings of India, the Vedas, contain descriptions thatcan only be understood in our times. I recognize a certain logic in this.Naturally, the celestials, those vain-glorious gods, knew that humans at thattime were unable to understand their technology. The same can be seen today inthe ethnologically accepted notion of the 'cargo-cult.'9 For human beings inthose days this celestial technology seemed like something from the realm ofmagic. Celestial stuff. But educated people were meant to report on this. Therewas method behind it all. Only thanks to the traditions from those legendarytimes were people of the future---we!---able to know what was happening in thosedays. And it was precisely this knowledge that would provoke us future ones topose new questions that would never have been without the old texts. When in1968, in my first book Chariots of the Gods?,I came up with the provocativequestion as to whether our ancestors might have had visitors from spacethousands of years ago, I had not snatched the question out of thin air. Certainindicators forced me to ask the question. But only after posing the questionabout whether our ancestors had visitors from space did new types of questionsbecome possible. Extraterrestrials? Do they even exist? What do they look like?Why should they have visited us? Why us? Why at that time, of all times? Whattechnology did they use? Now did they overcome the distances of light years? Howdid they even know that we existed? Why did they do what they did? What wastheir motivation? Have they left any evidence behind? Might they be coming back?If so, when? How would we respond? And so on, and so on. This entire catalogueof questions is only possible after posing the question about whether ourancestors might have had visitors from space. Before that, the main question hadnever been posed---and so there were no other questions. This is precisely themethod I see behind it all. A kind of paperchase, so that people in the futureshould be forced to ask the right questions and finally arrive at the rightanswers.In all this, it does not matter whether the people in those days understood whatthey were seeing and experiencing, nor in what mystical, nebulous manner theyrecorded their experiences. The content alone, no matter what the packaging,should make people in the future pause with suspicion. And that is exactly whatthey are doing. You have succeeded, you up there! In the Rigveda, for example,technologies, but also philosophical thoughts, are described that do not fitinto any category in those days. Here are a few tasters:All who leave this Earth will first all go to the Moon . . . the Moon is thegateway to outer space, and whoever is able to answer his questions is allowedto proceed beyond it. (Rig Veda, 1, Adhyana)100Naturally, the Moon is the exit base for interplanetary and interstellarjourneys. Space-ships of great size are able to take off from the Moon becauseof its low gravitational force. Or the ships can be assembled from a kit inorbit around the Moon, which is much easier there than in an orbit around theEarth. Certainly, these components had to be shipped first from the Earth to theMoon, but takeoffs to the mother ship that is being built are much easier fromthe surface of the Moon or from an orbit around the Moon than from Earth. Thething is, no human being living thousands of years ago could have known this.Space is far greater than the Fire [the Sun], as space contains both Sun andMoon, lightning, stars and fire. By virtue of space one calls out, one hears,one answers; in space you are happy and are not; one is born in space, one isborn for space; may you worship space. Who-soever worships space, he will attainspace wealth, worlds rich in light, unrestricted, for striding far and wide, andas far as space extends, he shall be able to roam there at will. (Rig Veda)101All of these statements are true. Now we just need to filter out the originalmeaning. Sentences like, 'Whosoever worships space, will attain space wealth'could be translated as, 'Whosoeverundertakes space research, will attain spacewealth.' India expert Professor Kanjilal in Calcutta told me that the Sanskritword stem of 'to worship' and 'to undertake' was the same, as human beingsundertake worship. Being born in space and for space is an old idea for anyastronaut. In future, spaceships will be built for entire generations of people;they will live, love, die and be born on board. The thing is: nobody could haveknown this thousands of years ago.When I read in the Mahabharata that Indra, the highest of those gods, explainsto Arjuna, that Time is the seed of the universe, then bells start ringing forme, perhaps not for others. Ask a modern astrophysicist when or how Time began?Time began at the same time as the universe began. Time is the seed of theuniverse. When I read that Arjuna had been instructed in the use of musicalinstruments in the celestial city, and that these instruments were restricted touse by the celestials, and did not exist in the world of humans, I could turncartwheels with joy. Why? Because here (as elsewhere) clear distinctions aremade between the celestials and us humans. They were not all the same.When I read a passage like, steered by Matali, suddenly lit up the sky,resembled tongues of fire without the smoke, or like a glowing meteor in theclouds, roses start blooming for me. Why? In various passages, Matali isexplicitly made to stand out as the pilot of Indra's celestial vehicles. Thepeople staring upwards recognize the tongues of flame around the vehicle, butare surprised that this fire is not accompanied by any smoke and, moreover,compare the thing with a meteor. A meteor is an object in the sky, which has atail behind it (to human eyes). Indra's flying ship was compared with a glowingmeteor, which spews tongues of fire without smoke. What more could one want?If I read about a terrible weapon that humankind has never experienced before, aweapon that makes all food toxic and also kills unborn children in theirmothers' wombs, then I know, as a world citizen in the 21st century, what ismeant. But the people thousands of years ago could not know. Any more questions?We today are bewildered, and this bewilderment is the result of thousands ofyears of indoctrination by religions. Every Earthling has been brainwashed withhaving to feel enveloped by God everywhere, and that he can be watched by God,even in the most secret place. This requires a God-Spirit who has to beomnipresent. Only a God-Spirit can do everything and penetrate everything. Theuniverse is God---pantheism, the teaching that everything is God, dominates inall religious-philosophical teachings in which God and the world are identical.God has to be an impersonal being in the sense of these teachings. Thisinterpretation was referred to by the great philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer(1788-1860) as 'polite atheism.' Even in Christianity, which allows the son ofGod to appear as a human being, there is a portion of pantheism, otherwise theChristian God could not be omnipresent. God has to be Spirit. Omnipresent,almighty and omniscient, he possesses the omnipotent gift to know in advancewhat is ever going to happen. Standing above everything in this way, humanconcerns are foreign to 'him.' As a God-Spirit he would not require anobjective, visible vehicle to move from one place to another. Spirit iseverywhere. Exactly: IT.Whether it is the Old Testament or ancient Indian religion, the God or the godswho manifested there used vehicles, were not infallible, used terrible weapons,destroyed innocent children and favoured certain parties. Where is the logic inthis? Whoever it was playing with human beings in those days, it was not God.Old Indian texts list metal alloys and liquids that were used as fuels,quicksilver or mercury among them. What is mercury, actually?Mercury has the characteristics of a precious metal; it is very constant in apure state. At a temperature of -38.83°C the silvery substance solidifies into acrystalizing mass that is lighter than lead. It will begin to boil at 357°C. Itdoes, however, evaporate slowly even at low temperatures; mercury vapour isreleased, which is very toxic. This strange metal will dissolve most othermetals, like gold, silver, copper, lead and even platinum---although at highertempera-tures. Curiously it does not do the same to iron, nickel, silicon ormanganese. How can mercury be contained if it dissolves even gold? It will onlywork with glass, iron or glazed ceramics (jars). Where is it derived from? It iseasily obtained from ores, as even steam from water or vinegar are sufficient todissolve out the mercury. In classical times, the element mercury was assignedto the planet Mercury. Many peoples worked it. (Aristoteles of Greece, 384 BC,refers to it as 'liquid silver' and Theophrastus, 315 BC, describes theextraction of the metal.) Mercury and mercury vapour form the most variedcompounds, which are used in all manner of industrial processes and for otheruses.If we follow the statements made in the ancient Indian texts, mercury was usedas a fuel, which was transported in the vimana, either in a container made ofiron, in a jug, or in a container made of mica. I am always amazed by facts thatarchaeologists pile into somewhere and which they are incapable of assigning toany category. Mercury was found in the tomb of the Chinese Quin-dynasty EmperorShihuangdi, whose dates are disputed. Large quantities of mercury! In March1974, farmers drilling for water near Lingtong (Shaanxi Province) came upon aburial mound, in which were later found about 7,000 clay imperial soldiers. Theywere all lined up ready to march. (In passing, the 7,000 figures alone pointedto an industrial-style production.) Gradually, models of several rivers werediscovered, sealed watertight with layers of clay---the Yangtse, the Huanghe andthe sea, all made of mercury. Above them had been modelled a splendid firmamentwith many celestial bodies. Large quantities of mercury in the tomb of amystical emperor from China---is this a unique find? But no, 25,000 kilometresaway by air, there was another amazing discovery of mercury.Copan, in present-day Honduras, is considered to be the 'Paris of the Mayaworld.' Copan appears gigantic with its pyramids and temples. The meanings ofmany puzzling sculptures and so-called 'anthropomorphic depictions' have notbeen clarified to this day. The city of Copan once controlled an important jadedeposit in the Motagua valley. Jade was more important than gold for the Maya.The 'hieroglyph stairway' from Copan is well known, and has the king list ofCopan chiselled into its 56 steps. This work was carried out by a king calledButz'Yip, which means something like 'smoke is his strength.' What smoke?Ricardo Agurcia, director of the excavations on the Copan project, discovered asubterranean temple there in 1992. The part above ground is called Temple 16,the subterranean one Rosalia. Naturally, Rosalia is much older than Temple 16because the latter was built over Rosalia. 'You come out of this lowtunnel---and suddenly you stand in front of a huge wall, 12 m tall, the façadeof the old temple, brilliant blue, red and ochre' wrote the excavator NikolaiGrube.102 Masks with gods' or human faces hung on the colourful wall, as well asthe 'more than 2-m-tall mask of the top bird god with numerous, well-preservedornaments.'102 From here a shaft leads down even further; on the steps areseveral Maya glyphs that even the best specialists (Linda Schele and NikolaiGrube) were unable to decipher. Not until later, with the help of a computer,did the decipherers come to believe that the temple had been consecrated by aking called Moon-Jaguar. Finally, the experts managed to uncover the foundationsof Rosalia, and there they believed they had hit the tomb of the dynasty'sfounder, Yax K'uk'Mo.However, no excavator was able to enter the tomb, as it was filled to the brimwith highly toxic mercury! Do we get an inkling of something here?In the meantime, an expert in a protective suit climbed into the mercury-filledvault and discovered that it was not the founder of the dynasty lying in thetomb, but a woman. A little deeper down was a further chamber. A male burial'with high quality grave goods' is supposed to have been viewed through ashaft.102 There seems to be silence on the subject of what high-quality burialgoods these might have been---as always whenever things are inexplicable, oreven mysterious.By the way, tourists may admire a perfect copy of Rosalia, with its fearfulmasks, in the new Museum of Copan. While looking at these, one is almosttransported back to ancient India, but this is often the case in CentralAmerica. One need only compare the ornamentation or the gestures made by thestatues, both here and there, or compare the temple pyramids in Central Americawith those in India. What did it say in the Kathasaritsagara, that collection ofIndian texts from ancient times? 'The flying vehicle never had to take up fueland took people to far countries across the seas.'Our archaeologists lack imagination---because they are not allowed to have any.Archaeology is a dyed-in-the-wool conservative branch of research, carried outby witty, humorous scientists, for the most part with great integrity.Inevitably, at their universities they are required to swat up on the homogenousmix of teaching that stubbornly orientates itself on the evolutionary principle.Everything has developed slowly, constantly, one thing after the other. Thespecialist for Central America knows nothing about Indian myths; he is notinterested in them. The specialist for Egypt has not the foggiest notion of thephenomenal prehistoric buildings in the highlands of Peru. The India expert hasnever studied the Old Testament, knows nothing about technical descriptions of aspaceship in the book of the prophet Ezekiel. If he/she did know, presumablyhe/she would make those cross-connections. But just a moment! This cannot be,because it is one of the dogmas of classical research that there were noconnections between one continent and the other thousands of years ago.Extraterrestrials? Real gods thousands of years ago? Impossible! Put on yourhairshirt and repent! And any expert who still has a modicum of ability to makefree associations will not dare to discuss with colleagues the finds that do notfit into the picture, let alone write about them. He would immediately becomesubject to ridicule. That which is not allowed to be cannot be. So one shouldnot be surprised if highly interesting finds are swept under the carpet and arenever made public. Even worse: Not even the other experts in the field are givena chance to hear about these mysterious finds.The same system applies to our media. A journalist who wishes to advance, tobecome an arts editor or even chief editor, first has to have proved that he hasthe specialist knowledge and the proper---serious---outlook. Both originate inthat old homogenous mix. Just as an archaeologist may not publicly report on asensational find that does not fit into any framework, a journalist who wishesto be taken seriously cannot write a really sensational piece of news withouthaving first covered his own back with the experts. But the latter do not dothis. With this really well-functioning system, we need not wonder any morewhether society is stuck in yesterday's know-ledge and is even brainwashed withthe notion that the present knowledge is the pinnacle of all knowledge.Now I am one of those people who, now and again, finds out something unusualfrom an expert. Naturally this is always proffered under oath of secrecy, andfairness compels me to stick to the secrecy agreed on. The same goes for me. Iwould not wish to break a confidence and thereby subject that person to theknives of their colleagues. Moreover, I would destroy that human relationshipand the source of information would dry up. What can be done with this viciouscircle? I help myself by asking the person who has told me something inconfidence whether I would be allowed to pass on this or that piece ofinformation. Sometimes they give me permission, but I am always begged not togive names. So, I stick to this with both a good and an uncomfortable feeling.The good feeling is brought about by the fact that I have not got my informantinto trouble, not exposed him. The bad feeling is caused by the fact that I havekept back valuable information. Which has the priority? With me, it is my word.In the media world, this behaviour is legally protected. No journalist can beforced to name his or her informants.Added to this double bind---which assails everyone who does what I do---is theproblem of one's own credibility. I am used to listing the sources of myinformation precisely so that they can be checked. I do not wish to appeal tofaith, because faith is the domain of religion. In the following section,therefore, I will relate information without revealing my sources, and thereader will be resigned to either believing me or not.The oldest tomb containing mercury was found in Copan. I know that similardiscoveries have been made elsewhere in Maya country, in Tikal and Palenque.Mercury, according to the ancient Indians, served as a fuel, and mercuryvapours, as we know today, are highly toxic. Why do so many of the top Mayapriests wear masks? In India, there were even masks with hoses, similar to ourgas masks. As we heard from the old Indian texts, mercury was transported incontainers made of mica, among other materials. Why have subterranean micachambers been found in Central America, not only among the Maya, but also amongthe Teotihuacanos in the highland of Mexico? Even if no mercury was discoveredin these chambers---and I have to say I cannot be sure that the excavators werenot fibbing a bit---this means very little. If a mica chamber is not properlysealed, the mercury may well have evaporated in the course of thousands ofyears. This, by the way, would explain the strange cases of deaths of highpriests (the knowledgeable ones) and rulers.What exactly is mica? Mica is a substance that is created over millions of yearsin mountains. It is a compound of silicon, aluminum and oxygen. Mica can bepicked apart like the leaves of a book and can appear in various colours. Thinlayers of mica have been used, even in the past, as windows in industrialfurnaces, because mica is heat resistant. Mica can also be found in theelectrical industry and in the building of antennae, as mica has proved to be anextremely good electrical insulator. This substance is even impervious to acids,at least to all organic acids.Mica has been found in the ancient tombs of North American noblemen, oftenpejoratively referred to as chieftains. Did they know anything about themultiple functions of mica? And where does it come from? Twenty years ago, asubterranean mica chamber was discovered in Teotihuacan, the giant complex atthe edge of the Mexico City (as I reported in my book,The Day the Gods Came).For the first few years after the discovery, the authorities for archaeology andanthropology in Mexico City made a holy secret of it. Why? Moreover, no one candispute that, after my publication in 1984, the secret crumbled away and now forthe last three years tourists, if they insist, are allowed to admire the ceilingof the mica chamber. A warden will lift the metal cover, which was fitted afterthe discovery and is secured with padlocks. Could any archaeologist give me oneconvincing reason for this theatre of secrecy? Normally, in these cases, talk isof 'protecting' the artefact. Something has to be protected from the 'stupidpublic.' Sorry, but mica does not rust, is indestructible, and both lightningstrikes and acids---which can arise from dead plants---are not able to affectit.Now, the gullible tourist may believe that because the secret is no longer asecret, the authorities would have laid their cards on the table. I have todisappoint you. A tunnel leads into the Sun Pyramid of Teotihuacan---forbiddento tourists. In the centre, underneath the pyramid, there arechambers---forbidden to tourists and researchers. There has never been a publicannounce-ment about what has been discovered in these chambers. And I would liketo see all the objects, not just a few items that are agreeable and acceptable.There is something else the public has not been told---and I have this from areliable source: a pipe insulated with mica runs out of one of thesesubterranean chambers. It would be revealing to trace the line of this pipe andfind out where the pipe runs to and what is at the end of it. I have not yetheard about whether this has not been done already, secretly. In the spring of2001, American archaeologists discovered two tombs with prehistoric skeletons ona mound called Nabta---1,350 kilometres south of Cairo. Both tombs were not onlydecorated with paintings of the heavenly goddess Hathor, but were also massivelyinsulated with mica. As no mica occurs naturally in this region, it must havebeen imported from the Sudanese mountains. Why and by whom, 4,000 years BC?All this secretiveness stinks to high heaven, and what really drives me up thewall is the hypocritical fuss by the responsible authorities who always act asthough there is no secretive-ness at all. But it is definitely going on---andhow! Nearly eight years ago, German engineer Rudolf Gantenbrink conductedresearch inside the pyramid of Cheops on a 20 x 20 centimetres shaft that isabout 60 metres long. At the end of the shaft, he discovered a small door withtwo copper fittings or hinges. I have previously reported on this.39 There is nolack of funds or tech-nology to open this little door before the eyes of theworld. But what happens? Secretiveness. The Department of Antiquities in Cairohas prevented an opening of the door with unspeakably threadbare arguments. Andif the opening is to take place in secret or has perhaps already taken place,the archaeologists responsible for the Great Pyramid have lost every claim tocredibility. They sit in their ivory towers and still maintain indignantly thatthe public really ought to believe their statements. They cannot understand thatthe public has become critical and sceptical---as if there had not been enoughpolitical and scientific misinformation during the past few decades.And while I am lifting the lid on these matters, here are a few more remarks onpresent misinformation. After the publication of my book, Chariots of the Gods?(Erinnerungen an die Zukunft), a new organization was set up in the USA, withthe goal of exposing once and for all this 'nonsense' à la Däniken and UriGeller and factually informing the public about the truth. CSICOP (Committee forScientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal) is the name of theassociation in America (in Germany it is called 'Skeptiker' Organisation). Nowevery sceptic and critic is, of course, free to state an opposing opinionvociferously and, if they so wish, to be indignant. But please do not do thisunder the pretence of delivering facts. Unfortunately, however, this is what hasbeen happening in the name of CSICOP. Robert Anton Wilson, the author of aninformative book on CSICOP, remarks in his foreword:By the New Inquisition I mean to designate certain habits of repression andintimidation that are becoming increasingly commonplace in the scientificcommunity today.104So how does this work? You gather a few scientists around you, who are naturallyconvinced that they are in no need of educating and know exactly what ispossible and not possible. Using these reputable names, you then publish amagazine---in the case of CSICOP it is The Sceptical Inquirer. The next stepconsists of getting TV-programme makers, who rely on the good names of thescientists, to put together a TV series. In the English-speaking world, this isHorizon, produced by the BBC. As both the BBC and the scientists who speak onthe programmes have a good reputation, the Horizon programmes are soon broadcastall over the world. So? What is wrong with that? By editing and leaving outthings, interviews used out of context, misrepresentations or insinuations andtargeted manipulation, the viewer is given an objective and seemingly truepicture---while the reality of the matter is quite different. This last happenedin October and November 1999.105 Two researchers, Robert Bauval and AdrianGilbert, had published a book entitled The Orion Mystery [in 1994] and had evenreported on it in a TV documentary.106 The two authors were able to demonstrate,with the help of Egypt-ologists and astronomers, that the great pyramids of Gizawere aligned on the constellation of Orion and must, therefore, be much olderthan accepted archaeological wisdom believes. The Horizon programmes by the BBCtore up this opinion, misrepresented the statements by Robert Bauval, twistedthe Orion picture and did not even allow the astronomer who had worked on thedecisive calculations for the new theory to speak. All in the name of scientifictruth! An amazing explanation. Presumably some of the good scientists, whoworked with CSICOP, did not even know who pulls the strings behind thisorganization.Today, every high school pupil knows what a DNA test is, and that such a testcan be used to convict criminals and confirm blood relationships. Some Japaneseexperts wanted to conduct DNA tests on Egyptian mummies in order to clarify,among other things, whether Tutankhamun's father was of royal blood. The SupremeCouncil of Antiquities in Cairo banned the project in the short term. ProfessorDr Zahi Hawass, head of the Council of Antiquities, quickly explained to thenews agency Associated Press why this had happened: 'The results of theseexaminations could be used to re-write Egyptian history' and 'There are peoplewho would like to change Egyptian history.'107 And there are evidently alsopeople who would like to prevent this.There is no question of credibility where the ancient Indian texts areconcerned. Nobody is required to believe in these texts as their contents speakfor themselves. And they are not concerned with beliefs. The statements alone,even if they are in a mythological package, are sufficient. The people ofancient India just cannot have known anything about the terrible weapons systemsthat were used and even less about vimanas of different kinds, let alone ofhabitats in space. But these things are still to be found in those texts,whether we like it or not.Since the 1950s, a few Indian scholars---some of them sages or masters(swamis)---have been looking at these ancient Indian writings with modern eyes.Texts exist that have a religious veneer---for example, those of the Krishnamovement. This does not change anything about the contents, as the age of thetext is recorded. The following story is derived from the tenth hymn of theSrimad-Bhagavatam:108It is the story of the battle between the Yalu dynasty and a daemon calledSalva, who had managed to obtain possession of a marvellous celestial vehiclewith the name of Saubha. Salva turned to the demi-god Shiva in order to obtainadditional forces to use against Krishna whom he hated and wished to kill.Salva, therefore, asked Shiva for a flying city, which should be so powerfulthat it could not be destroyed by any demi-god, daemon, human, Gandharva orNaga, not even by a Raksasa. He also wanted this aerial city to be capable offlying anywhere. Shiva the demi-god agreed, and with the help of the phenomenaldesigner Maya---who is also mentioned with the same functions in the epics andthe puranas---a truly frightening but stable flying complex was constructed thatcould not be destroyed by anybody. It was as large as a city and was able to flyso high and fast that it was practically impossible to see it. After Salva hadtaken over this marvellous flying vehicle, he flew off to attack the city of theYadus, against whom he nursed an undying hatred.Before attacking the city called Dwarka from the air, he had it surrounded by animmense army of foot soldiers. Both the strategically important parts of thecity, but also all the parts in which the inhabitants congregated, came underattack. There was a reason for this. Salva could have destroyed the city fromthe air but he wanted to get hold of a few selected people first. In addition,underneath the city lay defence forces against aerial attacks, which he neededto shut down first. Once the ground troops had been successful, Salva bombardedthe city with lightning strikes, rocks, poisonous serpents and other dangerousobjects. He also managed to create a hurricane, which was so violent that itshrouded all of Dwarka in darkness by darkening the sky with dust.Then the great heroes of Dwarka assembled and decided on a counter attack. Theirleader was called Pradyumna and he too had magic weapons at his disposal. Heimmediately employed them against the magic powers that emanated from Salva'sflying vehicle. Pradyumna and his heroes dealt terrible destruction among theadversaries' forces. Thousands of war chariots were destroyed and thousands ofelephants were killed. But there was still the terrible flying vehicle fromwhich Salva carried out his assaults. This flying vehicle was so mysterious thatsometimes one imagined one could see several flying vehicles at once in the sky,and then believed that none was present at all. It was intermittently visibleand invisible. The warriors of the Yadu dynasty were very confused because theykept seeing the strange flying vehicle appear in different places. Sometimes itappeared to be on the ground, then it appeared in the sky, then it seemed torest briefly on the top of a mountain only to reappear on the surface of water.The wondrous vehicle moved in the sky like a firefly in the wind, but neverremained for very long in one place. In spite of these manoeuvres, the warriorsof the Yadu dynasty would pounce on the flying vehicle as soon as they caughtsight of it. The warriors' darts shone like the Sun and were as dangerous asserpents' tongues.The battle lasted 27 days. At the time, Krishna, who had taken on the form of ahuman being, was staying with a king. He heard about the battle while he wasthere and he knew that Salva wanted to kill him. Using his own celestialvehicle, Krishna flew to the city of Dwarka and saw the catastrophe that hadtaken place. He immediately turned to his own pilot Daruka and commanded,'Quickly take me to Salva. Even though he is mighty and mysterious, you need notbe in the least afraid of him.' Krishna's battle vehicle bore a flag with apicture of Garuda. Salva noticed Krishna approaching and released a mightymissile against him that flew through the air with a noise like thunder. Itshone with such brilliance that it lit up the whole sky. Krishna, however, fireda counter missile, which caused Salva's missile to be broken up into a thousandpieces. Then he showered Salva's celestial city with a veritable flood of dartsjust as the Sun floods the entire sky with countless light particles on a clearday.Salva would still not admit defeat and projected a number of illusions into thesky. Krishna, however, saw through this ruse. Undeterred by all the magictricks, he located Salva's celestial vehicle and let off salvos of tongues offire against him. Salva's passion for battle resembled the passion of flyers whoplunge right into the adversary's fire. Krishna shot off so many darts with suchunbelievable force that Salva's armour was torn apart and his gem-encrustedhelmet broke into a thousand pieces. Then, Krishna shattered Salva's wonderfulflying vehicle with an almighty blow, and countless pieces of debris fell downinto the sea. Salva managed to get on to land before his flying vehicle hit thewater, but Krishna lifted his wondrous fire wheel that shone with brilliancelike the Sun. When this happened, Krishna resembled the red Sun as it risesabove a mountain. At the same moment, Salva was decapitated by the fire wheeland his head, together with his ear-rings and the rest of his helmet, fell tothe ground. Now Salva's soldiers set up a spine-chilling wailing and lamenting.Then the demi-gods arrived in their flying vehicles and caused flowers fromdifferent celestial planets to rain down onto the battlefield. A little later,Krishna visited the planet Sutala and the ruler there 'sank down in an ocean ofjoy.'This is an eerie scene. Ray-weapons, weapons of illusion, anti-missile missilesand climate-altering weapons are described as well as celestial structures thatare able to change their positions within the shortest spaces of time. Afterreading texts like that, I always ask myself what our science-fiction authorsare going to come up with next.Inevitably the question must be raised as to what happened to the remains ofthese weapons. If some of the wars that are maintained to have happened in theIndian texts really occurred, where is the debris? Where are the pieces ofcrashed celestial vehicles? Where are the remains of the bunkers of thedefendants? Where are the remains of the ray-canons that shot the glowing dartsinto space with unbelievable force?A cross-question: where are the remains of the thousands of tanks and aircraftfrom the Second World War? It is barely 60 years since that war and you willhardly find anything except what is displayed in museums. The battles in ancientIndia happened thousands of years ago---when exactly, nobody knows. Also, wehave graphic descriptions of how entire countries were laid to waste and ashes,how even ray-guns were employed and smashed celestial cities were plunged intothe oceans. Who could successfully retrieve any trace of this? And wheninexplicable objects are sometimes found---and I know of some---those pompoussouls deposit them somewhere with great dignity under a mantle of secretiveness.I am still convinced, however, that we will discover the traces of space battlesvery soon. Certainly, on the Moon, in the asteroid belt and on Mars. On Earthtoo if we look hard enough. This search has already begun, and it has beensuccessful.The above-mentioned story centred on Dwarka, which was attacked from the air bythe evil Salva. The same story, in a slightly different form, appears also inthe Mahabharata (in the chapters on Sabha, Parva, Bhishma Parva and MausalaParva). It is always about the destruction of the city of Dwarka. Did this placeever exist?For the past 50 years, Indian archaeologists have been asking themselves thesame question---and have struck lucky. Just as Heinrich Schliemann believed inthe stories by Homer, Indian scholars believe in the reports in the Mahabharata.Quite useable clues are given to the geographical location of Dwarka and, after30 years of painstaking research, have led to a result. The city described oncelay on the (present) gulf of Kutsh (between Bombay and Karachi, exactly at Lat.22° 14' E, Long. 68° 58' N). Much as in Troy (in present-day Turkey), theexcavators found eight layers at Dwarka, one above the other, with the littlemodern town,which was built in the 16th century, above the older ruins. At lowtide, walls can be seen leading into the sea. These remains caused the expertsto explore there too, by underwater archaeology. First, underwater cameras wereused, then magnetometer measurements were made, after which underwater metaldetectors were employed. While the Western media were reporting on underwaterfinds in the Mediterranean off Alexandria, the Indians---far away from thegeneral media hype---were discovering the city Dwarka mentioned in theMahabharata. First, the cameras began to capture pictures of artificially workedblocks of stone, 'which excluded any possibility of natural transport on accountof their size,'109 such as might have occurred by underwater currents or thetides. Then walls were found that met at right angles to each other, streets andthe outlines of former buildings, of temples and palaces of a once 'highcivilization'---this according to statements in a scientific report onDwarka.109 Finally, there were finds of nails containing iron with silicon andmagnesium components. 'There is no doubt that further metal alloy objects mustlie on the bed of the sea at Dwarka.' This assumption is based on results frommetal detectors. The scientific report on the finds, which were found up toseveral hundred metres from the coast, ends with the following words: 'The cluesin the Mahabharata about Dwarka as a city were neither exaggerations nor myths.It was a reality in the fullest meaning of the term.'Indian geologists who participated in the exploration of the underwater ruins ofDwarka came face to face with remains of walls that displayed traces ofvitrified stone. Stone will not melt unless extremely high temperatures areapplied. This kind of vitrified stone is found not only in Dwarka but elsewheretoo. There have never been any sensible explanations for the causes. As early as1932, Patrick Clayton, a geologist employed by the Egyptian government, foundpuzzling greenish shining vitrified sand in the dunes of the 'Great Sand Lake'(Saad Plateau, north of the south-western tip of Egypt). In July 1999, theBritish periodical New Scientist reported on vitrified sand in the LibyanDesert.110 No volcanoes exist there, which might have been cited as the cause ofthese features. The Bedouins have always fashioned knives and axe heads out ofthis 'desert glass.' More than 1,000 tons of the desert glass have been found sofar, without there being a convincing argument for its origin. Even in the 19thcentury, reports about inexplicable vitrification haunted the press. In 1881,the American Journal of Science reported on the occasional vitrified graniteblock111 that had been discovered in French castles of the towns ofChateau-vieux and Puy de Gaude (northern coast). In his latest book,112 Americanauthor David Hatcher Childress has listed 22 places in the world whereunexplained sand and stone vitrification can be observed. I myself have seen afew places with vitrifications above the Peruvian city Cuzco. The riddle hasnever been solved but it has also been pushed aside.And now? This is just the beginning of a search with modern instruments. It hasbeen known for decades that the rate of instances of cancer is much higher thanthe Indian average in the region around Jodhpur (Rajasthan, India). Unnaturalmutations have been observed in birds in the region. It was not until 1999 thatIndian scientists had the absurd idea of using detectors to check radioactivity,although there was neither a nuclear power station in the area nor had nucleartests been carried out. The Geiger counters provided unexpected results. Layersof ash under the sand and stone clearly demonstrated measurable high rates ofradioactivity. Where did it come from?The Russian periodical Trud reported on 24 June 2000 about Professor ErnestMuldaschew's expedition undertaken in the Tibetan-Nepalese border area. There,Tibetan monks had told him about the ruins of a city that had been built by thegods. The place was situated near the holy mountain Kailas. I am only repeatingthis with reservations because I could not check the source. Maybe, anexpedition will one day set out to this mountainous area, in which---at least Ican confirm this---exist wondrous traditions about those gods who, manythousands of years ago, were active as teachers of humankind.So where does our path lead? Right into the deepest past of humankind. Into aprehistoric period, in which we do not want to believe, as our eyes and commonsense have been gummed up with the sanctified theory of evolution.Although some progress has been reported in Chinese archaeology over the pastfew decades, China's ancient history still remains a mystery. The little thathas been discovered clearly points to those mystical 'ancient emperors' who oncecame from the sky on flying dragons. Rulers and priests in this 'Kingdom of theCentre' have for thousands of years considered themselves to be therepresentatives of the only and highest civilization of Earth, because theybelieve that they received their teachings, their technologies and theirastronomical knowledge directly from the gods. Reports in Chinese monasteriestell of the 'san huang,'the 'three exalted ones' and the 'wu di,'the 'fiveoriginal emperors.' These figures are not historically traceable. Writtenhistory begins with Yu, as the hereditary succession on the Chinese throne beganwith him. Yu is supposed to have been active sometime between the 21st and 16thcenturies BC. Naturally, he was looked upon as a divine being, and the same wastrue for Yu's successors for a long time. Even 1,000 years later, the Chineselooked upon their ruler, 'the great Yu' (Zhou period, 11th century BC to 771 BC)as a divine being who had lifted the land out of floods of water. Long beforethe great Yu there were the Xia and Shang dynasties, which have always beencategorized as mystical and not real by archaeologists, until a sudden find ofso-called oracles bones. These bones provided the names of 23 rulers that weredeciphered and found unambiguously to belong to the Shang dynasty. A total ofsome 100,000 inscribed bones turned up in subterranean installations nearXiaotun (in the north of Henan Province). Originally, there must have been farmore, because the local inhabitants had been grinding the bones to powder ashealing agents for hundreds of years. An entire library of bones. At present,only about a third of them have been deciphered as the inscriptions on the bonesencompass an alphabet of some 3,000 signs. That long ago!In the 11th century BC, the last Shang ruler was defeated by the Zhou, and onewould think that the cult surrounding divine rulers would have ceased at thispoint. Wrong---it had only just begun. The Zhou rulers lived according to therules of 'tianming,' the Mandate of Heaven. Heaven, Chinese 'tian,' was firmlyanchored in the heads of the priests and rulers. Every ruler was called'tianzi'---Son of Heaven. Rulers who did not live and reign in accordance withthe concept of 'tianming' could not be genuine sons of Heaven and were,therefore, deposed or killed.Who would be surprised to learn, then, that all the Chinese rulers from the veryearliest times (nobody knows how far back) had to carry out certain ceremoniesat an 'altar of Heaven' and had to speak to the old gods? The rulers were seenas intermediaries between Earth and the celestial powers, and they sawthemselves, without exception, as 'sons of Heaven.' To this day, two of these'altars of Heaven' are still known---one in Beijing and a second one, onlyrecently excavated, in the city of Xian. This 'altar of Heaven' is a roundstructure consisting of four platforms superimposed one above the other, with afifth platform in the centre. Each of these platforms lies about one metrehigher than the one underneath. Cross-walls that lead from the top to the bottomdivide the platforms into 12 different stages---as for the ancient Chinese, thenumber 12 signifies the division of the heavens into 12 parts. And what has allthis to do with India and Central America or with vimanas driven by mercury? InPeru, the Inca rulers and naturally their ancestors also looked upon themselvesas 'sons of Heaven' (as did the Japanese, the Persian and the Ethiopian imperialhouses). The 'sons of Heaven' in Peru also carried out their ceremonies andconversations with the divine ancestors on an 'altar of Heaven.' One of thesealtars lies above the Peruvian city of Cuzco, almost right above the puzzlingruins of the fortress of Sacsayhuaman. It has the same structure as the 'altarsof Heaven' in China, except they are halfway around the world apart from eachother! Who took on what from whom? Or who influenced whom?Whenever I study archaeological, ethnological or religious-philosophicalworks---and this happens every week during my work---I can never quite shake offthe feeling that I am stumbling about in the dark because nothing fundamentallynew ever turns up in these works. It is essentially hideously boring literature,written by similar-thinking people for similar-thinking people. They all behaveas though they had been programmed the same way, like unconscious beingstwitching in time with each other. I have ceased to be surprised about this, asI know how the system works. No real cross-referencing occurs outside of theirlearned subjects because it is not known.I maintain that at least some of the weapons described in the ancient Indiantraditions really existed and were employed---as were the vimanas and thecelestial cities. However, it should not be up to just me and a few like-mindedpeople to produce the proof for these assertions. Neither I nor my colleagueshave an institution at our disposal that would be financially in a position tosupply experts with the necessary means to address very specific questions.Under-water archaeology is very expensive, aerial archaeology no less so. In themeantime, ruins can be located as deep as 25 metres in the ground, with the helpof Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). This is done by emitting micro-waves in theP-band range from a height of about 3,000 metres. They are at frequency rangesof between 380-450 megahertz. The micro-waves penetrate deep into the ground andare reflected. Even objects that are only 30 centimetres long can be madevisible with the SAR-system. This kind of archaeological sounding is veryexpensive, of course. India cannot afford it. And afterwards one would have tofollow up the results; the finds would have to be analysed. If such technologywere to be employed in researching the ancient city of Dwarka, I am sure wewould soon come upon traces of former weapons systems as they are mentioned inthe Mahabharata.What should we do? All I can do is point out those cross-references and beg thescholars to become active in this or that direction. If space wars have takenplace, it should be possible today to find traces of them, somewhere on Earth,buried under thick sand and soil layers, somewhere in the oceans, covered overby mountains of coral. We are not lacking in technological aids to carry outsuch a first step. The finer work could be done later---I have a host of precisequestions about selected geographical locations. I cannot go to the Moon, evenless to Mars, although even there, the present-day results of measurements takenby space probes have turned up quite a few inexplicable things.As far back as 31 July 1976, the American Mars probes (Viking Project)photographed curious shapes on the surface of Mars, which became the startingpoint for speculation and a number of theories.113 A face was seen in theCydonia region of Mars (Viking photo 35A72). Rectangular structures thatresembled artificially made walls (Viking photo No. 86A10) and even structuresresembling pyramids were seen on the surface of Mars (Mariner 9 photos Nos.4205-78 and, even more precise, Viking photos 35A72, 70A13 and 70A11). It goeswithout saying that these curious formations were ascribed to natural causes,and 20 years later, the latest NASA photos no longer produce the face on Mars.The riddle was filed away. Too early, in my opinion. Although no face on Marsexisted on the latest pictures, one was able to see a giant ellipse of rock inthe position where the face once was. The wall-like rectangular structures arestill there, and the triangular form of a pyramid has survived. In the meantime,the first organic traces have turned up in Martian rock and NASA has announcedthat water, although in a frozen state, should exist under the surface ofMars.114 This points to former activity on Mars.The old question, regarding what is not right about the two moons of Mars, isstill unanswered. They are called Phobos and Deimos (fear and terror). They werealready known before American astronomer Asaph Hall discovered the moons in1877. In 1610 Johannes Kepler suspected that Mars was accompanied by twosatellites. What is really astonishing, however, is the narrative that appearsin Jonathan Swift's 1727 book, Gulliver's Travels, in a chapter about a journeyto Laputa. Not only did he describe the two moons, he even knew their size andorbits. In the third chapter, we find the following:'They [the Laputan astronomers] spend the greatest Part of their Lives inobserving the celestial Bodies, which they do by the Assistance of Glasses, farexcelling ours in Goodness. For, although their largest Telescopes do not exceedthree Feet, they magnify much more than those of a Hundred with us, and shew theStars with greater Clearness. This Advantage hath enabled them to extend theirDiscoveries much farther than our Astronomers in Europe. They have made aCatalogue of ten Thousand fixed Stars, whereas the largest of ours do notcontain above one third Part of that Number. They have likewise discovered twolesser Stars, or Satellites, which revolve about Mars; whereof the innermost isdistant from the Center of the primary Planet exactly three of his Diameters andthe outermost five; the former revolves in the Space of ten Hours, and thelatter in Twenty-one and a Half; so that the Squares of their periodical Times,are very near in the same Proportion with the Cubes of their Distance from theCenter of Mars . . .'How was Jonathan Swift able to describe these moons if they were only discovered150 years later? It is a fact that these satellites are the smallest and mostpeculiar moons in our solar system: they move in almost circular orbits aroundthe equator of Mars. Phobos and Deimos are the only moons in our solar system sofar known to move faster around the mother planet than the planet itselfrevolves. Taking into account the rotation of Mars, Phobos manages two orbits inone Martian day, while Deimos moves around Mars a little faster than Mars takesfor a revolution around its own axis. The peculiar characteristics of Phobos donot stand in a proper relation to its apparent mass.Naturally, one assumes the same history of creation of the Mars moons as for allother moons around other planets. It is believed they are fragments from spacethat have been captured by the gravitational field of Mars. This theory has oneflaw: both of Mars' moons orbit the planet in almost the same plane above theMars equator. One fragment may accidentally do this, but for two to do it, thetheory that it is purely coincidental becomes rather tenuous. In the meantime,various satellites from Earth have peered at these Mars moons and sent back goodphotos to Earth. Both moons are both 'potato-shaped' fragments with variousimpact craters. Twice, attempts have been made to fly above the Mars moons at arelatively close distance. None of the satellites from Earth attained itstarget. Our earthly probes 'went blind' before they could transmit photos backto Earth. The earlier photos sent back to Earth by satellites have not clearedup the problem of the Mars moons. We now have 'potatoes with craters,' true, butwe know as little about the inner life of these minute space bodies as we doabout their peculiar orbits.The question about the craters that pepper all the moons and planets in oursolar system has never been answered satisfactorily. Admittedly, space debrisconstantly bombards the surfaces of planets that have no protective layer ofair---which would at least cause the smaller fragments to burn up. But why arethere so many craters? And why on such midgets like Phobos and Deimos? Those tworeally do not have the gravitational fields of large planets. One cannot helpgetting the impression that an unbelievably heavy barrage of asteroids once flewthrough our solar system. From where? What was the cause? We know that hundredsof thousands of these bits of space debris have accumulated between Mars andJupiter, in the so-called asteroid belt. Nobody knows the cause of this. StarWars?Here too, humans have the technological means to pursue these questions, butnothing is done. Why? Because the 'system' would think it was absurd to releasefunds for such projects.The same state of affairs goes for the Moon, which is only 384,000 kilometresfrom us. Several NASA probes photographed 'unexplained tectonic anomalies'there. One of them, in the Mare Crisium, resembles a kind of bridge. Theendlessly diligent Luc Bürgin, who has now become the chief editor of a Baslenewspaper, reported on this.115 Another phenomenon, which can be observed fromEarth itself with a halfway decent telescope, lies in the Mare Vaporum (forastronomers, 16.5° N and 4-6° E). A runway-like line stretches right through theMoon debris, and even seems to cut through parts of rocks. The line terminatesat both ends with a straight line and two right angles. Nature does not tend toproduce lines like that, especially not across a stretch of 30 kilometres. Wehave missed something here so far, because we do not want to know more. Thiswill change, because humans will eventually settle on the Moon and later onMars. This is as certain as the Sun rising in the East. And this is why I ampleading for reason and a relaxation of attitudes: let us research these riddlesand stop all the childish secretiveness.Based on the photos alone, I would consider it rather adventurous to attemptgeological dating with regard to the Moon or Mars. Naturally, geologists knowabout the layering of rocks on Earth and how many million years it took forcertain formations to attain their present structures, and naturally, insightsbased on conditions on Earth can be transferred to other planets. But all thisis not sufficient to date, at a distance, rectangular shapes on the surface ofMars, because although the surrounding rocks may be millions of years old, theartificial shapes need not be. It is rather as if we were to photograph theEarth's surface from Mars and were to discover something like a wall in amountainous valley. Geologists would work out when the mountainous valley wouldhave had to have been created and would not understand that the wall was reallya dam. Conclusions are drawn too quickly. With regard to the Moon or Mars, weshall only obtain reliable data if a human being or robot stands on the spotitself. A human being would be more reliable than a robot, because a human beingcan make deductions and will notice details that may escape the robot'sprogramme.A variety of geological dating methods exist on Earth, all of which have theirshort-comings. The origins of the ancient texts themselves cannot be dated, evenif we locate the oldest manuscript. Why not? Because we do not know how old thestory was before somebody wrote it down for the first time. Indian astronomershave tried to reconstruct a date for the Mahabharata by studying any mention ofastronomical information. Based on such references, this Indian epic could havebeen produced at any date between 6,000 and 3,000 BC,116 perhaps even earlier.A further problem arises through the different datings of various calendars. Ihave mentioned before that the Maya calendar---adapted to ours---gives a date of11 August 3114 BC for its inception.103 Why? Because 'the gods came down fromthe pathway of the stars' on that day. 'They spoke the magic language of thestars in the sky.'117 That was 5,000 years ago, in a time we know nothing about,but that does not stop us from pretending we were there. Aymara Indians in theruins of Tiahuanaco (Bolivia) celebrated the beginning of their calendar on 21March 2000. The beginning was exactly 5008 years before. In India, the Westerncalendar is officially used, but 20 different calendars appear in theirreligious traditions, all of which have different inception dates way back inthe past. A Sirius calendar has been foisted on the ancient Egyptians, one thatactually never existed, and the Jewish world religion starts its calendar withthe creation of the world. That was on 7 October 3761 BC. Now, according toJewish tradition, 1,000 years count as one day with God. This means that whenthe seventh millennium begins for the Jewish calendar, the seventh day beginsfor God. According to Jewish concepts, this is when the Messiah will come again.I have already previously discussed the fact that all peoples, whether extinctor not, are familiar with the concept of some kind of bringer of salvation.39 Wedo not seem to be able to learn from this. How has that witty satirist amongscientists, Professor Erwin Chargaff, phrased it:'The only thing we learn from history is that we learn nothing from historyand---all this takes up thousands of pages.'118Our knowledge of the past history of humankind is lousy. In former millennia,book burnings were organized by politicians and religious authorities in orderthat only one truth should prevail. Such acts of destruction do not occur anymore today, quite the opposite: the planet is teeming with books and millions ofmessages flit around the world via the internet. Not that it helps us much, ashuman beings will only pick out what they want. And even then, only a very smallnumber of human beings can afford such things, compared with the six billionsouls on our blue globe. Quo vadis, homo sapiens?Over the last few years, French astronomer Chantal Jègues-Wolkiewiez has madesome astonishing discoveries that have made a number of prehistorians veryangry. Madame Jègues studied cave drawings in some depth, among them those inthe cave of Lascaux in the French Dordogne. The cave drawings have been dated toabout 17,000 years ago. Logically---the dogma of evolution does not allowanything else but logic---only primitive Stone Age people could have existedback then. In fact, the cave drawings do show horses, stags, bulls, curiouslines and dots, all fashioned with the colours that were available in the StoneAge. Archaeology has only ever interpreted these cave drawings to mean littlemore than the needs of hunters of large game to decorate their caves. But thebest of these decorated caves are not in locations where our Stone Age hunterswould have lived, but miles away from them and always in areas that aredifficult to access. Prehistorians have concluded from this that the cavesserved as assembly halls in which certain ceremonies were carried out, that theywere probably places of importance for spirits or shamans---who have always beencited in connection with every kind of nonsense. Therefore, Stone Age peoplewere presumed to have created prehistoric shrines---they were the churches ofthe Stone Age.Madame Jègues discovered some quite different connections. As an astronomer, shenoticed things that would not have occurred to archaeologists at all. The cavedrawings actually depict stars and entire constellations that the Babyloniansand Chaldeans had always been thought to have observed and named---much later!Here we had the constellations of Scorpius, Aries the ram, Taurus the bull, themountain goat Capricorn, and so on.This could not be coincidence, as the insights gained by Madame Jègues areconfirmed every year, both by astronomy and the position of the cave complex.Every year, at the summer solstice, the rays of the setting Sun shine down thecave entrance and illuminate the drawings in the Hall of the Bulls. MadameJègues says, 'This place was not chosen by coincidence. The drawings werecreated as part of a fantastic show, when the sun shines into and illuminatesthe entire Hall of the Bulls.'119First of all, this astronomer had made a map of the starry sky as it would haveappeared to an observer 17,000 years ago. Then all the dots and lines of theanimal figures were measured meticulously and the results obtained were comparedwith a computer programme of the night sky of 17,000 years ago. Thecorrespondence between the two was exact. Astronomer Gérald Jasniewicz(University of Montpellier, France), who checked Madame Jègues's data,commented, 'Several elements tally without any room for doubt. The alignment ofthe cave towards the summer solstice, the positioning of Capricorn, Scorpius andTaurus in the hall correspond with the sky at that time.'119 What does thescience of prehistory have to say to all this? 'Pure speculation,' according toDr Harold Floss of the University of Tübingen.Nothing new under the Sun. Things cannot be that cannot be. Astronomers in theStone Age just do not fit into the framework of evolution, the only frameworkthat makes us happy. Cave dwellers have to be primitive; they may hunt big game,scrape furs, look for berries and carve spears. They may be prototypical, andare allowed to have smeared simple drawings onto the cave walls, but they arenot allowed to have been capable of abstract thought and definitely could nothave known exact astronomy. There was a lot of rain 17,000 years ago, and thesky could not be observed all year round, so how could the Stone Age hunter havestudied astronomy? In addition to which, these fur-clad dolts would not have hadthe time, anyway. They had to hunt mammoths, defend themselves against bears,protect their families and keep the fire going. There was no time left forastronomy of a higher kind.So, how could this have been? Let us assume, for a moment, that the battlesdescribed in the Mahabharata with all those space weapons of the gods(radioactivity . . . vitrified sand and rocks!) really had happened and thesurvivors of that terrible epoch had been thrown back to the Stone Age. They hadnothing left; no libraries, no metal tools, no pleasure gardens or swimmingpools, not even fabric or writing tools. Even the most necessary things ofeveryday life had to be created all over again. The weapons of the gods had donetheir work efficiently. This is not such an absurd scenario; it can be readagain in the works of the philosopher Plato, as I have noted before.4 In spiteof the catastrophe, the survivors still had one thing: their knowledge. Thisthey passed on verbally to the next generation and tried to depict things theyconsidered important with the means at hand, such as the home of the gods, thelocations in the sky.Today, nobody who is familiar with the material can dispute that all the StoneAge peoples were quite crazy about astronomy. In the area around the Gulf ofMorbihan alone (Brittany, France), 135 out of a total of 156 dolmens are alignedon the summer or winter solstices.120 Stonehenge in England has proven to be agreat observatory that made possible a whole chain of astronomical predictions.The prehistoric builders had observed the paths of many stars like Capella,Castor and Pollux, Vega, Antares, Altair or Deneb.121 Even German astronomersfound out, after some delay, that the Stone Age folk of Stonehenge were able topredict all the solar and lunar eclipses.122 And if one can believe the officialdating (about which I have my doubts, for good reasons), long before Stonehenge(5,143 years ago) our fur-clad Stone Age brothers built their giganticjourneyman's piece at Newgrange in Ireland, astronomically aligned, ofcourse---how could it have been otherwise?123, 124The only question is: why should these Stone Age people, who had hardly comedown from the trees, be so obsessed with astronomy? This is something theexperts cannot agree on.All of the peculiar things that I have touched on here do exist. The details ofall these matters are publicly accessible, whether in books, on the internet, orin specialist periodicals. But nobody draws conclusions from them. Has humansociety become lethargic? Has that inner urge of curiosity dried up? Are wesimply overfed with information? Would we rather slouch in front of thetelevision or the computer screen instead of crawling about outside? What goodis this increase in knowledge in our electronic age if we do nothing with it?Our youth in Western countries fiddles about with keyboards and plays with theinternet; colour screens bombard our retinas with pictures and data that areimmediately forgotten again. We 'surf' over information but do not 'dive' intoit. Ten years ago I reported on a 5,000-year-old tool factory that exists notfar from the Dutch village of Rijckholt, between Aachen and Maastricht, but thatdoes not fit into our picture of Stone Age people. When I visited this place inthe summer of 1998, I was only able to find out that the branch of sciencerelevant to the find was not interested in this prehistoric flint mine. It ispushed away and forgotten. Television has never bothered to become involved inthis fascinating riddle, and the most the experts can do is to pluck at theirWoodstock-era beards and know nothing. It is a mystery to me what they spendtheir time reading.So, what of the old mine? I wrote about it in some detail in my book, DieSteinzeit war ganz anders.120Here is a brief resumé:During the 1920s, monks in the Dominican monastery of Rijckholt discoveredshafts in the ground, from which they eventually brought 1,200 flint axes to thesurface. Members of the Dutch Geological Society managed to rummage around andcome up with 66 mine shafts during the 1960s, but a few thousand more aresuspected. The number and size of the mine shafts gave rise to estimates thatsome 41,250 cubic metres of flint core pieces must have been extracted duringthe Stone Age. This would have yielded a production of some 153 million axes!15,000 tools were located in the shafts and conservative estimates indicatedthat some two and half million of these Stone Age tools must still be lyingabout in the ground. If one assumes that the mine had been worked for, say, 500years, a daily output of some 1,500 axes would have been produced. And all ofthis was more or less exactly 5,160 years ago.It is well known that Stone Age hunters used flints for all kinds of purposes.Flint core lumps are found in chalk strata from the Cretaceous Period. Naturereleases flint lumps when the chalk mantle dissolves through the action oferosion and weathering. So far, so good. This kind of dissolution rarely happenson the surface, and definitely not in Rijckholt. So who instructed our Stone Agefolk, who were not members of unions, that a layer of flint was to be found deepin the ground, under a layer of sand, gravel and chalk? Who organized thebuilding of mine shafts? Removing one cubic metre of chalk would have cost aboutseven broken stone axes. Who 'sold' these huge quantities of the stuff? Wheredid the goods go? What routes were used? What chief or boss organized the wholething? Is there something situated in the proximity for which one would requirethousands upon thousands of stone axes? A figure of at least 1,500 axes per dayis not chickenfeed.I do not know the answers, but the world of experts should be interested in it.They seem not to care. Young archaeologists who are spoilt by the internet donot go on digging expeditions. This flint mine, with all its accompanyingparaphernalia, does not fit into our concept of Stone Age people, whichprehistorians have been spoonfeeding us for decades. This is the way things goin the Western world. But it is different in the Asiatic sphere. There, althoughthe basic concept of evolution is scientifically anchored (one thing arises fromanother), people think in very different passages of time than they do in thedominating West. Passages of time are also elements of religion, which is why noIndian scholar has any quarrel with the yugas (enormously long periods of time).Perhaps mankind has indeed become human from ape-like ancestors on theevolutionary path, but some circumstances or other---possibly wars with divineweapons---have thrown humans back into the Stone Age, and they had to dustthemselves down and start all over again. Or genetic intervention by the gods(classical and ancient literature is full of artificially created human beings)gave humans an evolutionary shove into the future. The Asiatic world thinks interms of very different passages of time because the religious traditions are acomponent of thought in those societies. These traditions, even if they wererenewed over and over again, were turned to stone in temples and sculptures. Allthe Indian temples are copies of those celestial habitations of the gods whoonce followed their courses across the heavens. Celestial vehicles turned tostone. The Temple of Konarak in the Indian province of Orissa, which has nowbeen added to the UNESCO list of protected monuments in the world, served as alandmark for centuries for sea-going ships heading for Calcutta. The pagodapoints to the sky, black as a raven. Only when they were on land would the seatravellers have noticed that the entire temple complex resembled one giantcelestial vehicle, with a total of 24 wheels around it. Naturally, the structureis aligned astronomically, and it goes without saying that it is woven in withthe calendar. The temple is supposed to be a copy of the vehicle that Indra onceused to fly through the sky. This is nothing out of the ordinary in India. Allthe temples are celestial vehicles, and the top of every temple is crowned withsome kind of vimana, those smaller flying vehicles in which human beings andgods flew in the sky and in space in those times. They and/or their descendantscould just as well have turned up in the Peruvian desert of Nazca, or could havehad huge quantities of flints scraped out of the ground in present-dayRijckholt, for whatever reasons, if they had had a mind to. Nothing would haveprevented them from doing so. The gods and the demigods were mighty and thehumans whom they ripped off did everything for them.The gods were supposed to have used certain weapons? So the masons andplasterers tried to copy them (which they never managed to do!). Scientificstudies exist on this,125 which nobody in the West is interested in. The godsand certain selected humans had disposed of secret weapons, it says in theancient Indian texts. Has anything changed regarding this? Since Francis Baconobserved in the 16th century that knowledge is power: every group tries topreserve its knowledge in secret---as long as they can. Encoded messages, secrettechnologies, insider knowledge, and the like, did not only exist in the past.Today it still exists---more than ever. 'Secret knowledge is power.'126Climate-altering weapons are mentioned in the Indian texts. Impossible? Atpresent the American military is researching such a weapon. Where? North of thelittle town of Gakona (Alaska, USA). The project is called HAARP (High FrequencyActive Auroral Research Program). Once it is fully developed, HAARP will be ableto cut proper holes in the sky and make targeted alterations to the climate.Nothing new on God's earth.India's gods are supposed to have chosen individual human beings and smallergroups to be their servants, from whom the royal houses were then derived? Isthis nothing but a disguised form of racism? And what about that business withthe ancient Israelites who considered them-selves to be the chosen people? Thisstill applies today, and within the huge Jewish family of belief, some considerthemselves to be more chosen than others. Perhaps they are. The descendants ofthe Jewish high priests---those from the house of the Levites who were speciallyeducated and looked after the ark of the covenant---are the present-day Cohenim.Approximately five per cent of the world population of male Jews belong to thisgroup and they all actually carry the same genetic markers on certain parts oftheir Y-chromosomes. Jerusalem rabbi Jakob Kleinman has said of this, 'The genesprove that God keeps his promise: we will not be lost.'127Nothing is lost and gradually the old truths see the light of day again. In sofar as they are allowed to be published.Until not so long ago, astronomers taught that our Earth had a unique positionin the universe. The argument went that the location of our Earth was simply alucky one-off, as the Earth orbits the Sun at the ideal distance: not too warmand not too cold. Only because of this could life evolve in the way it has. Thistheory has been scrapped. British astronomer Sir Martin Rees, a professor atKing's College Cambridge, publicly admitted, 'Planetary systems are so common inour galaxy, that Earth-like planets probably occur in their millions.'128 Iwould like to bet that it will take another 10 years at least before thisinsight penetrates the school books and another 40 years until the believers ofthe totalitarian religious communities are allowed to learn this. 'The finalgoal of every censure is only to allow books which nobody reads anyway'(Giovanni Guareschi)."},{"pageContent":"Afterthoughts [The_Gods_Were_Astronauts_split_001.html#filepos1634] \"Clever people may pretend to be stupid, the reverse is much more difficult.\"---KURT TUCHOLSKYI HAVE been mocking the theory of evolution ever since I started writing books.And I do this even though I know that all forms of life are subject to the lawsof evolution. I never set out to question the basic direction of evolution. Theonly thing is that evolution has not run in a straight line but leap-frogs intwo directions. On the one hand, genetic messages are constantly fed into the'Earth system.' They reach us via cosmic dust. On the other hand,extraterrestrials make targeted interventions in the human genome. As isasserted in the traditions of humankind, the gods created humans 'in theirimage.' Genetic material has been inserted into our evolutionary process. I willnot repeat again here why I have been representing the case for this concept formore than 35 years.Year after year, anthropology serves up contradictory data about our ancestors.Hardly has a new skull turned up than we are being presented with the verynewest, up-to-date pre-human. A constant process of squabbling. No sooner had wegot used to the Out-of-Africa theory---according to which the firstrepresentatives of Homo sapiens set off out of Africa about 100,000 years ago topopulate the Earth---than Out-of-Africa is seen in relative terms. 'The more weknow, the more bewildering the picture becomes,' said American scientist DavidMann.129 This bewilderment is only going to increase.In 1973, for the first time, a virus gene was successfully introduced into abacterium. In 1978, the synthetic variant of the human insulin gene wastransplanted into a choli bacterium. In 1981, the first transgenic mammalsfollowed: seven mice. In 1988, the Harvard cancer mouse was presented to aflabbergasted humankind; a year later, transgene sheep and goats followed, andshortly afterwards, the transgene cow. In between, human sperm donation andartificial fertilization became routine and the first test-tube babies wereborn. Botanists, not inactive, began manipulating the genes of plants. Then camethe cloned mice, sheep and, recently, cattle. The next items to be createdaccording to designer genes were mixed beings and while I write these lines, Ihave just read about the latest trick of geneticists---the first geneticallyaltered primates.130 Scientists at the University of Portland (USA) have giventhe little monkey the sweetest name: ANDi (DNA reversed with an 'I' on the end).As always, these developments are commented on in magazines and on TV shows, andgroups of people who have not the foggiest idea what it is all about startinterfering. In principle this is a good thing in a democracy. A great deal istalked about ethics and morals, and that human beings should not play God. Thereis a final boundary (I heard this said by level-headed theologians) that Godwould not countenance. Only one person has understood this, and even spoken itout loud: British physicist Stephen Hawking. In front of a large audience inBombay, he observed that gene technology would one day create new humans whowere cleverer and more resilient than the present humans.131All efforts and all laws passed would not alter a thing about this. Hawking'sstatement is not even original. What is approaching humanity in terms of geneticinnovations is old hat. It existed thousands of years ago and can be read in theliterature of our forefathers. Many traditions report on genetic manipulation ofthe human genome, on targeted artificial mutations and naturally also onchimaera, those mixed beings of mythology. The ancient interventions were all bythe gods. They were 'changing the points.' One may argue about the reasons whythey did this, but very soon no longer about the fact that it happened. Why not?DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), the ancestral material of our genes, has beendecoded and transparent man has arrived. In spite of the decoding of thecomplete human genome, the task has not ended here. We now know the pages of thebook, so to speak, but not yet the individual phrases and words. Twenty yearsago, when I wrote about the decoding of the human genome, I earned ridicule andrejection. This would never be possible, I was told, with all those billions ofpossibilities that lay in DNA; if it was ever to be, then it might possibly comeabout in 1,000 years. And what now? The family tree of human beings is containedin the genetic message, and our geneticists, with their unbelievabletechnological possibilities, are too clever to overlook this fact. In a fewyears' time, they will discover that certain sequences in this design cannot bethe outcome of the evolutionary process. They will find that there weresomething like ancient parents (Adam and Eve), but not just one pair. They willfind out that 'somebody' has been manipulating our genes, and theywill---whether they want or not---have to ask who might be responsible for this.The answer has been lying on the table before the question was even asked: thegods. The next arguments will be about what kind of gods, and finally willfollow the entire catalogue of questions that like-minded people and I have beendealing with for decades. Will we then have reached the end of science, the endof history or the end of religions? No.Two powers control human thinking: science and religion. They move on differentpaths but both have the same departure point and the same goal. The cause?Curiosity. The goal? Know-ledge. All our doing and thinking is about science andreligion. What has faith to do with research? What has scientific insight to dowith faith? A church that ignores the secure scientific insights is dogmatic andwill not be able to survive in a planetary society. Self-righteousness cannot gowith science. And a science that ignores awe and the inner voice of religiousfeelings will find it hard to exist as we, the religious ones and the scientificones, all live in the same world. The religious side may delay scientificresearch. This often happened in the past. Are questions of faith and theologyfundamentally different from questions of science? In the end, probablynot---both are searching for a final truth. The paths to knowledge vary. A monkin his monastery may arrive at the same results about God and the creation ofthe universe as the astrophysicist. The difference is that the astrophysicistcan prove his knowledge---the monk is given his. His knowledge has to bebelieved. Lately, research has uncovered a connection between human good healthand mental attitude. Statistics show that optimistic people become ill withcancer less often than depressive people. A human being is a psychosomatic unit.Now, neurological studies explain what is taking place in our'neuro-transmitter,' the brain, and we can even make visible those electricimpulses in the brain. But we do not know how they arise. Science and religionare working in the same human being. What is this spirit inside us that makespossible imagination, curiosity and even causes healing?Humans have tried to broaden their horizons with all kinds of drugs. They haveexperienced a different world in an LSD-induced trance. But this other world wasreally the same as before, only the senses and therefore perceptions hadchanged. To this day, not a single scientific insight has resulted from thismind-altering pill. So where does the spirit come from? This is both ascientific and a theological question. Science gives answers to questions on theBig Bang or Big Bangs, on black holes and the expansion of the universe.Religious philosophers would like to know whether we are alone in the universeand whether creation only happened because of humankind. Only science canprovide answers to those questions. And if science finds out that we are notalone in the universe, this will in no way mean the end of religion, but itscontinuation. What theological insights have the extraterrestrials arrived at?Based on what scientific data? Science and religion are actually compatible,just so long as religion is not dogmatic. Is there an intelligent designerbehind the cosmos? Is God the first (and last) source for our whole behaviour?Even for our scientific curiosity?One thing is certain: religion cannot disconnect itself from scientificinsights. The laws of gravitation do not adhere to religious or culturalboundaries. Crusades in the name of religion can no longer be carried out.
