Where did they comefrom? Where did they go? Why did they leave unfathomable buildings behind whichmake us shake our heads when we look at their ruins? What was actually going onunknown millennia ago? Why did the people of those times do what they did? Whomdid they serve? Who directed them? Who were their gods? Why is no writing foundeither inside or outside their stone marvels? After all, at least the architectsof the time must have had command of some form of writing. Without it, extensivecomplexes are not conceivable. What complexes? What—you may well ask!—am I goingon about?We are talking about buildings without history, cultures about which we knownothing, although they have left conspicuous traces behind. This applies notonly to the stone circles and subterranean complexes, but also the largepyramids of Egypt. Little of what people try to tout as serious scientificthinking is correct. Scratch the surface, and we are left with unbridgeablecontradictions and an earth-shattering naivety among the experts. On top ofthat, we have something simply inconceivable, something which should notexist—and yet covers our landscape. Demonstrable, measurable, checkable foreveryone. Large parts of Europe lie under a geometric grid: I mean whole chainsof original buildings which, without exception, are the same distance from oneanother, across hundreds of kilometers. These pseudo holy sites were slumberingthere as long ago as the Stone Age, planned precisely by someone or other.Shaking our heads, looking the other way, or ignoring them will not make thesepoints disappear off the map. They exist whether it suits the academic andpublic circus or not, and I appreciate every professor of surveying who finallydecided to take a closer look at this incredible reality.This is another volume in a five-volume series about the impossibilities ofprehistory. This book is concerned with the large geographical areas surroundingthe Mediterranean and the countries in its orbit. Every volume is intended tohave 160–200 pictures and 100 pages of text. At the end, that will produce 1,000pictures and 500 pages of text. The work as a whole should be understood as anupdated digest of the wealth of information in many of my books. Repetition isintentional; without it, my new readers would be left dangling. Yet—and this iswhat makes the five-volume series so explosive—the most recent discoveries havebrought current knowledge to a boiling point. The contradictions scream to highheaven. The forest of question marks keeps growing."},{"pageContent":"IMPOSSIBLE BUILDINGSA hundred kilometers southwest of where the city of Tangier is located inMorocco today, at the western entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar, theCarthaginians in the seventh century BC built an ancient port city. They calledit Lixus, “the eternal one.” But this Lixus was built on top of the giganticblocks of another, older, Phoenician city called Liks. The Phoenicians, in turn,had settled there as long ago as about 1200 BC. Not on a whim, for thePhoenicians—the great seafarers of antiquity—had come across the remains of amegalithic civilization in the same place. They made use of that. Those unknownmegalithic people, the original builders of what later became Lixus, must havehandled the imposing stone blocks as little Jimmy handles his toys. (Images 1–4)The harbour breakwater was as good as lined with colossal stone blocks, and theramparts were built of hundreds of huge, partly cut granite rocks. If we want tounderstand how impossible that is, we should briefly consider that everytechnology follows a fixed evolutionary pattern. At the beginning, the simplepeople who have just descended from the trees learn how to handle wood and smallstones. Then we get the first modest tools and primitive working of stone. Nextcomes the dressing of the raw blocks and their planning into larger structures.At length, some sort of transport is invented and tested, followed by themanufacture of fibers into pulleys or similar constructs. Finally, the humanmasses are divided and organised.image [../images/f0010-01.jpg]1image [../images/f0010-02.jpg]2image [../images/f0011-01.jpg]3image [../images/f0011-02.jpg]4In Lixus, this “natural evolution of technology” is turned on its head. At thebeginning, there was an ancient, unknown culture with the ready-made knowledgeabout how to work and transport extraordinary stones. Then, at some point in thecourse of the millennia, came the Phoenicians, followed later by theCarthaginians and, finally, the Romans. All these subsequent civilizations usedthe ready-made blocks from that unknown mysterious people, who at some pointthought up and built this complex. (Carthage itself was totally destroyed by theRomans in 146 BC.)Thor Heyerdahl, the famous experimental archaeologist, started his Atlanticvoyage with the papyrus boat “RA” north of Lixus, and for good reason: that iswhere there is the strong flow of the Canary Current which carries vessels toCentral America with minimal effort. Heyerdahl had not lost his sense of awe. Hewrote about the megaliths of Lixus:Stones cut in various sizes and shapes, but always with vertical and horizontalsides and corners which fit exactly into one another like the stones of a giantjigsaw puzzle; even when the blocks displayed so many right-angledirregularities that the outlines could have been decagonal and dodecagonalinstead of right-angled.1 [ch05_note.html#ch02note1a]Outside the city center of Lixus, whole ramparts of overgrown, curious stoneformations lie about, which at first sight look like broken natural rock, butare not. Every more-detailed examination reveals that they have beenartificially worked and precisely cut. (Images 5–8) Down at the beach at lowtide, the blocks of a former breakwater can still be found; they do notoriginate from the Romans or the Carthaginians, let alone the Phoenicians. Thearchaeologist Gert von Hassler writes about them (Images 9–11):Thus the original walls of an Atlantic port have been preserved which occupiesan important place in our collection of curiosities. Its stone blocks canneither be argued out of existence nor shifted in time. Lixus is definite: not aMoroccan fishing village, not a Roman temple square, not a Phoenician tradingpost. A prehistoric seaport.2 [ch05_note.html#ch02note2a]In his Natural History, the historian Pliny the Elder (AD 23–79) recounts thatthe original Lixus had once been a temple of Hercules.3[ch05_note.html#ch02note3a] This temple was surrounded by the much sought-afterGarden of the Hesperides. The Hesperides were singing nymphs and, as the Greekpoet Homer (c. 800 BC) recounts, also daughters of the gods Atlas and Zeus.4[ch05_note.html#ch02note4a] In addition to their daily singing, these gracefulladies also had to guard a grove with golden apples. That went dreadfully wrong.Together with the nymphs, there lived in the Garden of the Hesperides a serpentcalled Ladon. The task of this reptile was actually to protect the beautifulnymphs, but the inevitable happened. The mighty Hercules, one of the heroes ofthe Greek Argonautica5 [ch05_note.html#ch02note5a] (story of the capture of theGolden Fleece), killed the serpent.image [../images/f0013-01.jpg]5image [../images/f0014-01.jpg]6image [../images/f0014-02.jpg]7image [../images/f0015-01.jpg]8image [../images/f0016-01.jpg]9image [../images/f0016-02.jpg]10image [../images/f0017-01.jpg]11image [../images/f0017-02.jpg]12image [../images/f0018-01.jpg]13image [../images/f0020-01.jpg]14image [../images/f0022-01.jpg]15image [../images/f0024-01.jpg]16image [../images/f0024-02.jpg]17image [../images/f0025-01.jpg]18image [../images/f0025-02.jpg]19image [../images/f0026-01.jpg]20image [../images/f0026-02.jpg]21image [../images/f0027-01.jpg]22What has any of this to do with Lixus? The story about the origins of Lixus digsdeep into matters mythological. The elements of the beautiful, seductive nymphs,the serpent, and the stolen apples is interrelated with the Biblical story ofParadise, with Adam and Eve and the fatal bite out of the apple.Was Lixus the same as the Biblical Garden of Eden? A paradise created by a godto raise the first humans? The most ancient stonework in Lixus was undertaken bya civilization of which we know nothing at all.Today there is little left to see of the original Liks. It is difficult for thetourist to trace a few ruins of even the Roman Lixus. The place lies about threekilometers north of the Moroccan town of Larache, on the motorway from Tangierto Rabat. The river Loukos winds its way toward the Atlantic Ocean. (Image 12)The banks of the river are a popular bathing beach. A golf course and modernsettlement are being built just a kilometer away—part of it on the land of theancient Lixus. On a hill overlooking the river, there are the remains of a Romanamphitheatre (Images 13–14), a temple to Neptune and, in between on the hillsidefacing toward the river, ruins from that unknown age. Monolithic longitudinaland transverse blocks are still recognizable today which, although they wereused by the Romans, were not their original building materials. The Romans usedwhatever happened to be lying about. (Images 15–16) And at the harbourbreakwater on the Atlantic, there is a jumble of mighty blocks where it isdifficult to see what was scattered by the roaring breakers and what wasartificially processed in ages past.image [../images/f0028-01.jpg]23About 30 kilometers north of Lixus, between the towns of Larache and Tétouan,the stone ellipse of Mzora lies on a hill. (It’s also written “M’Soura,”“M’Zora,” or “Msoura.”) The complex is difficult to find. Not a signpost far andwide. The ellipse consists of 167 monoliths and is surrounded by a rampart.(Images 17–22) The longitudinal axis is 58 meters, the width 54 meters. Afive-meter-high obelisk towers at the western entrance. Artificial incisions canbe identified on individual blocks. (Images 23–25) No one knows what they mean,just as no one has the faintest idea who planted the megalithic ellipse of Mzorain the landscape, when it happened, and why. But Mzora is just the first of theimpossible facts. The list gets more and more unendurable.image [../images/f0029-01.jpg]24image [../images/f0030-01.jpg]25A tourist traveling from Granada, Spain, along the N342 (or from Malaga, theN331) toward Antequera should take the opportunity for an educational break andstop just before reaching Antequera. That is where the megalithic super gravesof Menga, Viera, and el Romeral are located. Curiously, the Menga complex isdescribed as Cueva de Menga, cave of Menga. Yet there is no natural cave. TheCueva de Menga is deemed to be “the most impressive and best preserved dolmen inthe world.”6 [ch05_note.html#ch02note6a],7 [ch05_note.html#ch02note7a] Thealleged “cave” lies outside the town of Antequera and is described as amausoleum in the specialist literature, although no corpse has ever been foundin it. This Stone Age miracle is 25 meters long, 5.5 meters wide, and 3.2 metershigh—big enough to drive a tractor about. (Images 26–28)image [../images/f0031-01.jpg]26No one knows who first entered this artificial structure because, until 1842,the dark space served as a cool chamber for keeping fruit and vegetables. Ofcourse, people started to dig—twice even, in the years 1842 and 1874. Theresults did not yield any clues as to who built it. A renewed attempt was madein 1904; after all, there had to be something to find in this giant dolmen. Thehard-pressed soil finally revealed a discus-shaped stone structure, whosepurpose is unknown. No body, no bones, no sarcophagus, but below the ceilingthere are some cross-shaped engravings and a five-pointed star with a diameterof about 18 centimeters.The ceiling is a miracle in itself. The rear-most stone is 8.07 meters long and6.3 meters wide. It has an estimated weight of 180 tonnes—certainly nolightweight. The actual “burial chamber,” which never existed, is covered byfour monolithic slabs resting on mighty stone supports. Each of these lateralload-bearing stones is a good meter thick, the covering slabs more than twicethat. All of it just a little bit massive for nothing. Anyone who moves andraises such monstrous stones might have taken care to ensure that the content ofthe tomb would stand the test of time. Or at least might have attached a littlesignature from the builders.image [../images/f0032-01.jpg]27image [../images/f0032-02.jpg]28All the building materials of the Cueva de Menga consist of hard, tertiary Juralimestone quarried nearby at Cerro de la Cruz, no more than a kilometer away.That might not be a great distance, but still well-nigh impossible whentransporting a slab weighing 180,000 kilograms! All the monoliths of Cueva deMenga are anchored into the ground with smaller stones. The surveyor of the clanmust have attended an outstanding school of Stone Age architecture. Yet theCueva de Menga is no more than a small step into the land of the impossible.The limestone mountain Cuevas del Rey Moro, “caves of the black king,” lies inthe west of the province of Valencia in Spain; on its summit there is amegalithic town. Like Cueva de Menga, it is also called “Menga” although it liessomewhere completely different. The strange part about Menga is probably notmentioned by any classical historian because no one knows who built it and noone understands what in the world happened there millennia ago. Around the townof Menga, there is a “tram network” with “rails”—not rails from our time, butthe remains of tracks that look like tramlines imprinted into the stone to adepth of 15 to 20 centimeters.8 [ch05_note.html#ch02note8a] Yet the “tracks”near Menga are not unique either.The town of Cyrene lies 400 meters above sea level in the barren desert south ofthe cities of Benghazi and Tobruk, in present-day Libya. As the teacher andwriter Uwe Topper reports, legend says that it was built by a giant calledBattos.9 [ch05_note.html#ch02note9a] He must also have been pushing carts,because the tracks cannot be missed. Near the city of Cadiz in Spain, too, everytourist can see tracks of about 100 meters in length in the water at low tide.There are several.And on the sunny Mediterranean island of Sardinia, the attentive visitor willstumble over numerous tracks. Even better, the island of Malta is covered inthem. It goes against the grain to raise all of this old hat again, because Ihave reported about Malta in several books.10 [ch05_note.html#ch02note10a], 11[ch05_note.html#ch02note11a] Hence long-winded repetition is superfluous.Moreover, the pictures speak convincingly on their own.image [../images/f0034-01.jpg]29image [../images/f0035-01.jpg]30image [../images/f0036-01.jpg]31image [../images/f0037-01.jpg]32image [../images/f0038-01.jpg]33image [../images/f0039-01.jpg]34Every attentive tourist in Malta will sooner or later see the “cart ruts,” asthe Maltese call them. Once again, these are railway track–like grooves in theground, which could not have been tracks because the they are of differentwidths. (Images 29–33) Southwest of the old capital Mdina, near Dingli, thegrooves in the ground accumulate and appear to be coming from everywhere, as ata railway junction. That is why the area is called “Clapham Junction” (a busyrailway junction in London). These really are strange tracks: they pass throughvalleys and climb up hills. Frequently, several run alongside one another andsuddenly converge into a double track before abruptly taking audacious bends.(Images 34–38) On several stretches of coast, such as St. Georg’s Bay, south ofDingli, and Marsaxlokk Bay, the tracks go purposefully into the blue waters ofthe Mediterranean. (Images 39–41) The Malta researcher Alexander Knörrdiscovered whole collections of tracks that go under the water.12[ch05_note.html#ch02note12a] Then they suddenly end at a sharp drop. There musthave been a rock slide, including the tracks, at such places. (Image 42)image [../images/f0040-01.jpg]35image [../images/f0042-01.jpg]36image [../images/f0042-02.jpg]37image [../images/f0043-01.jpg]38There is plenty of speculation about this Maltese riddle. Were they cart ruts,skids of sledges? Roller bearings? Did the original inhabitants of Malta puttheir loads on a kind of forked branch and drag them across the countryside withdraught animals? No good. The forked branch would have been too rigid and wouldnot have changed the width of the tracks. Anyway, in that case, the tracks ofthe animals who pulled the heavy loads should also be evident in the limestonerock. But they aren’t. Or—as the researcher André Schubert proposes—are thetracks in reality the traces of quite ordinary vehicles which only drove alongthe route once but on what was then soft ground?13 [ch05_note.html#ch02note13a]There has certainly been plenty of speculation. The “tracks” were a cult... acalendar... a conduit system... writing.... We are flooded with clever and,indeed, logical explanations, and yet an ultimate answer which is beyond anydoubt is still missing. I consider the Maltese tracks to be a classic case ofarchaeological misconception and will explain why nothing can add up: Malta mustnever be looked at in isolation. Whatever this unknown civilization in pastmillennia might have been, it was—as we have to realize today—transnational. Itwas connected with the whole Mediterranean area, including the adjacent regions,from North Africa to Britain, from Spain to Egypt. Track-like grooves in theground can also be found in Sicily, Italy, Sardinia, Greece, southern France,Spain, Portugal, Turkey, and so on. The timeframe in which these incrediblethings happened is not 2,000 to 3,000 years BC, but a good 10,000 years ago ormore. Today we know nothing about that time; there are no archaeologists at anyuniversity who are studying these things. Although “pre- and early history” isstill taught at individual universities, it is without exception restricted totiny geographical areas. Something like a comprehensive overview over the wholeof Europe and beyond appears to be taboo. People are valiantly investigatingtheir own little region. Giant spaces do not fit into the concept.image [../images/f0044-01.jpg]39image [../images/f0045-01.jpg]40image [../images/f0046-01.jpg]41image [../images/f0047-01.jpg]42image [../images/f0047-02.jpg]43image [../images/f0048-01.jpg]44image [../images/f0048-02.jpg]45image [../images/f0049-01.jpg]46image [../images/f0050-01.jpg]47image [../images/f0050-02.jpg]48In Europe alone, there are several hundred stone and wood circles from theunknown past, and although no magazine called Megalithic Today existed at thetime, all of these circles have an astronomical orientation. And all weredesigned using the same unit, the so-called Megalithic yard of 82.9centimeters.14 [ch05_note.html#ch02note14a] Who cares? Several of thesecomplexes lie under water. For example, columns of menhirs lie off the island ofGavrini in Brittany; two stone circles are also snoozing there at a depth of 12meters under the Atlantic. Tracks near Cadiz, in Malta, or on Sardinia lead intothe water. And nowhere is there a science in sight that cares about that. What asuperficial lot we have become! A society, moreover, that imagines that, thanksto the Internet, it is the best informed. Forget it!Who, apart from the intelligent disbelievers and doubters who are interested bythe mysteries of the world, has ever heard of a “hypogeum”? The word comes fromthe Greek and means “below the earth” (hypo meaning “below” and gaia meaning“earth”). The Hypogeum of Malta is just as mysterious as the tracks on thesurface. The space was discovered purely by chance. In 1902, a builder found astone slab in the ground near the quay wall of the large port of Malta which didnot fit there. He levered it up and peered down into a rectangular shaft whichdisappeared vertically into the depths. The builder kept silent. He knew thatthere were subterranean complexes all over the island. He also kept his mouthshut because he feared the authorities might block his building plans. Today theunderground chambers have been opened up to tourists—with restrictions. Groupswanting to visit the Hypogeum have to register in advance. Guests are firsttaken into a cinema where they can admire impressive pictures of the rockchambers. Then they can go in single file along a prescribed ramp to view a partof the complex. The Hypogeum is different from any other dolmen elsewhere in theworld, different from the royal tombs in Egypt. Passageways branch off the mainchamber to niches and smaller chambers. (Images 43–44) Walls and ceiling havebeen worked in perfect Megalithic style: clear lines and sharp edges on mightyblocks. Above them is a rounded, curved ceiling in three layers, one above theother. (Images 45–46) A total work of art, it is a masterpiece which does notfit into the Stone Age at all. The monoliths extend smoothly from the floor tothe ceiling, the niches have been flawlessly hammered out of the rock, thecurved ceiling even in the form of a dome. That is totally alien to Stone Agethinking. (Images 47–48) Who chiselled this complex out of the rock? What was itfor?image [../images/f0052-01.jpg]49It is the same as at Lixus. It was not the Romans, Greeks, or Phoenicians,because the Hypogeum had long been in existence in their time. The Greeks werejust as unaware of the complex lying up to 12 meters underground as the Romans.From the rear-most chamber of the Hypogeum, a shaft leads into unknown depths,in which up to 7,000 skeletons are said to have been found. I cannot checkwhether this is true.The Stone Age is called the Stone Age because people worked with stones. Theydid not know metals. Flint, at minimum, would have been required to chisel theHypogeum out of the rock. It is harder than limestone. But there is no flint onMalta. The guidebooks for tourists say the Hypogeum had been built in threephases. It may well be true that in later periods (whenever that may have been!)natural niches in the rock were extended and smoothed, but this has nothing todo with the main chamber and the curved, domed ceiling. “These chambers displaya symmetry in their construction which has no equal,” the Malta specialistAlexander Knörr writes.15 [ch05_note.html#ch02note15a] “Furthermore, thechambers have impressive acoustics. Words whispered into an oracle hole can beloudly and clearly heard in the whole complex.” Once again, Stone Age geniuseswere at work here whose methods we cannot even begin to fathom. The academicdiscipline that should take responsibility refuses to include these things inits research program, and so the impossible is suppressed. The same applies tothe 30 megalithic temples on the island, whereby at least the temple of Mnajdracan be shown to be at least 12,000 years old. How is that possible? (Images49–50)image [../images/f0053-01.jpg]50image [../images/f0053-02.jpg]51image [../images/f0054-01.jpg]52image [../images/f0054-02.jpg]53image [../images/f0055-01.jpg]54The cartographer Paul Micallef, used to precision work by nature of his job,made an astonishing discovery during the survey work in Mnajdra.16[ch05_note.html#ch02note16a] The whole Mnajdra complex looks like a trefoil witha diameter of about 70 meters. The temple has an astronomical orientation. Onthe day of the summer solstice, precisely at sunrise, a beam of light shinesfrom the right entrance monolith into the oval chamber behind. There it throws asmall, vertical beam of light on to a block standing on the left side. But thatwas not always the case. At about 3700 BC, the beam went past the monolith andtouched the edge of a stone lying further back; 10,000 years BC, it wasdifferent again. At that time, the beam of light precisely hit the center of thealtar stone lying even further back. At the winter solstice on December 21, thespectacle repeated itself except from the opposite side. But there is no altarstone there. Sounds complicated.image [../images/f0056-01.jpg]55image [../images/f0058-01.jpg]56image [../images/f0060-01.jpg]57image [../images/f0061-01.jpg]58image [../images/f0062-01.jpg]59That there is no coincidence involved is shown by the alignment of the templewith the dates of the spring and autumn equinox. How is it possible to read adate of 12,000 years from this natural play of the light? This is where we getto the exciting bit and Images 51–54 prove it: Depending on whether it is thewinter or summer solstice, a column of light is created on the monolith lyingbehind on the right or left side. The right-hand monolith measures 1.33 metersin width, the left-hand one 1.2 meters. The light columns can easily be read offthe right monolith; after all, we know what line is created at the wintersolstice of our century. The column of light circuits the whole stone once inthe course of 25,800 years. Its width signals the start of the whole spectacle:10,205 BC. That this number is difficult to digest for my friends thepre-historians is understandable. The date completely upsets the wholemuch-loved categorisation of our Stone Age ancestors. But it is of little valuein any case, as I will go on to show.If hitherto we have always learnt that religious culture started in Mesopotamiawith the Sumerians, followed later by the Babylonians, Egyptians, and a fewothers, this school of thought is wrong again. In southeastern Turkey, about 15kilometers northeast of the provincial capital Şanliurfa, excavations areunderway at Göbekli Tepe, which once again call into question the naturalevolution of technology, as they do of spirituality. Göbekli Tepe, incidentally,means “potbelly hill” in the local language, and according to legend, thepatriarch Abraham is said to have been born in the nearby city of Şanliurfa. Acircular temple complex was uncovered in which three rings of walls enclose acenter. (Images 55–56) There are monoliths which remind us of seating, and atthe edge of the inner circle there are T-shaped stone columns, weighing up to 16tonnes, with individual incisions on them—circles, half-moons, and a carvingsimilar to our letter “H.” We can also admire stone carvings of foxes, lions,snakes, gazelles, and cranes. (Images 57–59) All the T-shaped crossbeams on topof the monoliths are aligned toward the center of the complex. So far, three ofthese ring-shaped complexes have been uncovered. Yet geomagnetic measurementshave revealed the existence of at least 20 other stone circles. A mere 10percent of the structures lying under the ground have been recorded. All in all,a difficult lump to digest: it has been determined to be 11,500 years old. Whoin the obscurity of that distant past built not just one, but several stonecircles directly next to one another? Weren’t we always taught that the fur-cladnump-ties of the time had been fully occupied with foraging for food and keepingwild animals at bay? Reality speaks a different language. Anotherincomprehensible thing: the builders are said to have reburied their stone ringsintentionally and at a time of peace. Not simultaneously. They buried one oftheir complexes and then started building another circle nearby. “What is themeaning of that?” the archaeological writer Hartwig Hausdorf enquires. “Did [thebuilders] want to preserve the unique complex for the people of the future? Whatmessage did they want to send us?”17 [ch05_note.html#ch02note17a]image [../images/f0064-01.jpg]60image [../images/f0066-01.jpg]61image [../images/f0066-02.jpg]62Nothing is impossible. I cannot, however, see why a civilization would carefullybury its holy sites, if that is what they were, in sand and rubble for thepeople of the future. After all, they could not know whether their complexeswould ever be discovered again. I consider another variant to be more likely:they buried their structures in order to prevent anyone being harmed in them.Had a deadly disease broken out which they could not control? In Leviticus, theLord gives precise instructions from chapter 14 onward about what should be donein the case of infectious diseases—up to and including the destruction of theaffected buildings.18 [ch05_note.html#ch02note18a] The fact is that Göbekli Tepewas gradually and carefully buried again by someone, and it happened about 8,000years ago.The location of Göbekli Tepe is also a curiosity. Why here? What was soimportant about this geographic site? After all, the builders needed water butthe nearest river lies five kilometers away. What important event turned thislocation into holy ground, a spiritual site for the community? Some religiousthought must have united the people. Perhaps the patriarch Abraham can help;after all, the place of his birth, today’s city of Şanliurfa, lies only about 15kilometers away. Something extraordinary did indeed happen in Abraham’simmediate environment millennia ago. It is told in the Apocalypse of Abraham.19[ch05_note.html#ch02note19a]There an eyewitness tells in the first person how the boy Abraham was workingone evening in his father Baruch’s garden. We learn how two “heavenly beings”descended to earth.20 [ch05_note.html#ch02note20a] The two of them grabbed theboy Abraham and dragged him “to the edge of the flames.” Incidentally, Abrahamis quite specific that they were not human, because they did “not have humanbreath” and they “sparkled all over their bodies like sapphire.” Then the smokeand fire opened up, and the sparkly characters ascended with Abraham “as if withmany winds.” Up there, Abraham sees “from the heights we had climbed somethinglike a powerful, indescribable light” and finally large figures who spoke wordsto one another “which I did not understand.” Next, the youth Abraham notessuccinctly and unequivocally where he is: “But I wished to travel down to earth.The high place where we stood was sometimes upright but then it turneddownward.”21 [ch05_note.html#ch02note21a]We should savor this statement. Here we have someone reporting from ancienttimes, written down in the first person, that after his journey toward the skyhe had wished to descend downward to earth. He must logically have been outsidethe earth. Furthermore, Abraham must have been in a spaceship in orbit aroundthe earth. Why? Because “the high place where we stood” is rotating around itsaxis: “was sometimes upright but then it turned downward.” Every spaceship inorbit rotates constantly around its own axis because such rotation creates acentrifugal force inside it: artificial gravity. Not something a Stone Ageperson could have known—unless he experienced it on his own body.This is just one suggestion for the archaeologists searching for a spiritualevent to explain the mystery of Göbekli Tepe. The Apocalypse of Abrahamdescribes a sensational, plausible reason for the inconceivable. After all,“Abraham’s ascension” started in the garden of his father Baruch, and he liveddirectly next to “potbelly hill” called Göbekli Tepe.There are thousands of granite blocks—so-called menhirs—in Brittany which areset up in geometrical lines.22 [ch05_note.html#ch02note22a], 23[ch05_note.html#ch02note23a] They form Pythagorean triangles (a2 + b2 = c2), andthey did so millennia before Pythagoras. No professor of archaeology isinterested. (Images 60–63) Straight lines are drawn across Europe over hundreds,sometimes thousands of kilometers. They connect Stone Age holy sites from Norwayto Sicily, from Denmark to Greece—not something that is actually possible,because our ancestors would have had to survey the whole of Europe for that. Butthe impossible is a reality and has been proven without a shadow of doubt.24[ch05_note.html#ch02note24a], 25 [ch05_note.html#ch02note25a], 26[ch05_note.html#ch02note26a] The discoverers of such realities are ridiculed andmocked by society. There are neither honors nor prizes for them. No one takesresponsibility: no foundation, no university, and no newspaper publisher, letalone a TV station. Cowardice, a lack of moral courage, rules. And all of ushave become fellow travelers of indifference. There are hundreds of dolmens inthe Mediterranean region and just as many stone circles. The great majority ofthem have an astronomical orientation. Our society with its electronicstupification, could not care less. Stone Age? Lost civilizations? Of whatrelevance is our past to us? Yet incomprehensible facts lie below everyone’sfeet, so to speak, which do not fit into any conception of history orarchaeological textbook. The absurd thing is that all these impossible factsabout which I am about to report are childishly simple to check without anygreat effort. The only things that are required are a map, dividers, and aruler. And in no time at all, ancient links on European soil become visible,links that should never have existed because they originate in that unknown,fairy-tale Stone Age over which there rises a stench of decay. The impossible isreported next.image [../images/f0069-01.jpg]63"},{"pageContent":"CRAZY FACTS“It seems as if the whole of northeastern Bavaria is covered by a network ofsuch aerial lines....” These words come from Karl Bedal, who investigated acurious network of lines in his home region and rediscovered his sense ofwonder.1 [ch05_note.html#ch03note1a] “Millennia ago,” the thorough Karl Bedalsaid, “the eastern part of Upper Franconia, that is, the Fichtel Mountains andFranconian Forest, was covered with impenetrable woods.”2[ch05_note.html#ch03note2a] It was not until after the birth of Christ thatfarmers and monks arrived and began the clear the forest. So there cannot havebeen a network of lines in that hilly, Bavarian forest which links Stone Agepoints with one another. Make sense? Yet it does exist. Karl Bedal writes,“These are inexplicable straight lines which cross and intersect oneanother...always comprising a measure of 6.75 km or a multiple thereof, that is,13.5 km, 27 km, up to 54 and 81 km and so on.”3 [ch05_note.html#ch03note3a]The small town of Schesslitz is located in the Upper Franconian district ofBamberg (Bavaria, Germany). It is also known as the “gateway to FranconianSwitzerland.” Northwest of it, there is an ancient wooden cross called the RedCross. A heathen cultic stone previously stood at the same spot. From the RedCross, draw a straight line in a northeastern direction to Castle Peesten 27kilometers away. Nothing special about that: two points can always be connectedwith a straight line. From Peesten, the line continues to Tennersreuth, 27kilometers away—and another 27 kilometers to the Schönwald Stone near Schönwald.Up to this point, we have measured three times 27 kilometers as the crow flies,a total of 81 kilometers—this in hilly primeval forest. We started inSchesslitz. From there, lines radiate in all directions to target the followingother points: Peesten (northeast), Hoher Kreuzberg (east), the druid groveDruidenhain at Ebermannstadt (southeast), Auerberg (south), the Rote Marter nearKaiserpfalz (south), Pommersfelden (southwest) and Hummelmarter (west). Everypoint is precisely 27 kilometers distant from Schesslitz. (Image 64)image [../images/f0072-01.jpg]64What looks like a silly game turns out, on closer inspection, to be prehistoricplanning. The town of Staffelstein lies north of Bamberg, and a short distanceaway from it, the Staffelberg mountain. From here, 27 kilometer-long linesradiate out to Rotheul, Haig, Veste Rosenberg, Burghaig, Schloss Thurnau, HoherKreuzberg, Unteraufsess, Heiligenstadt, Rothof (north of Bamberg) andBurgpreppach. That alone makes eleven points around the Staffelberg mountain,all of them 27 kilometers away. But this only scratches the surface of theinexplicable grid which indisputably lies over the landscape. In his pamphlet,which, incidentally, is published by the Historical Society of Upper Franconia,Karl Bedal flawlessly demonstrates the existence of a whole grid of ancientpoints which are all connected by dead-straight lines. The distances are always27 kilometers, half of that (13.5 km) or a quarter (6.75 km). To quote KarlBedal, “The whole system of lines is interlinked and connected, all crossingpoints and nodes are linked through other cross-connections.”4[ch05_note.html#ch03note4a]image [../images/f0073-01.jpg]65All just a game? Did Mr. Karl Bedal simply draw a few lines on a map and someplaces just happened to lie underneath? Definitely not. The straight lines andidentical distances mean that any coincidence is absurd. What Mr. Bedal (andothers) discovered in Germany was found by Monsieur Xavier Guichard in the sameway in France. Our Mr. Guichard first held office as the chief of police inParis, then studied philology, advanced to become the vice president of theFrench Society for Prehistory, and began to ask himself how many places theremight be in France with the same root word in their name. So he startedsearching for places containing the word “Bourg,” others with the root words“Flora” or “Calais.” At the word “Alaise,” his heart began to beat faster.Believe it or not, 382 place names contained the same root word, and a further47 places went back to “Calais.” That could no longer be described as normal.Monsieur Guichard reached for a ruler and map. Many of the places lay under astraight line from the British Isles over the Alps to Sicily: Calais—MontAlix—Mont Alet—L’Alet—Anxon—Aisey—Alaise—L’Alex—Alzano—Calesi—Cales, and so on.Here 24 lines from all points of the compass crossed at the village of Alaise.(Image 65) This place lies in the eastern Jura, northeast of Salin-les-Bains,just 70 kilometers away from the Swiss border—actually in the heart of Europe.The 24 lines that cross here run from Scotland to Corsica, from Great Britain toFrance, from Portugal to Germany. More and more parallel lines appeared. One ofthem intersected Carlisle and Ely in England, Calais and eight further namesderived from Alaise in France, and went via Alasio and Calice in Italy to Alisoon Corsica. Xavier Guichard originally thought that the whole system of lineswas based on the old “wind rose system.” Before longitude and latitude wereintroduced, maps were made in accordance with the “wind rose system.” A pointwas fixed, usually on a hill top, and lines were drawn from there in variousdirections. Someone then rode along those lines to measure the length of theride from one point to the next. Cross-connections between the lines were alsopossible. But Guichard soon noticed that many lines had to be older than anywind rose system. Frequently the points were not just the same distance from oneanother, they also touched on places which were unknown in the early MiddleAges—for example, a Stone Age settlement under the waters of Lake Zurich nearthe town of Meilen. Rotten poles, bones, ceramics, and stone from a settlementthousands of years old were found there in the winter of 1854. Xavier Guichard’sline went precisely over it. Furthermore, the wind rose system could not explainlines from England to Sicily. The linear distance is about 2,000 kilometers. Andthe prehistoric holy sites with the common root words—L’Allet, Alaise, L’Allex,and so on—existed long before the wind rose system was introduced. Thephilologist Guichard could not contain his surprise and noted, “There must atsome point have existed a homogenous civilisation which was based onconsiderable scientific knowledge.”5 [ch05_note.html#ch03note5a]image [../images/f0074-01.jpg]66Incidentally, the village of Alaise, where all the lines intersect, was a druidholy site as late as Roman times. In 47 BC, Julius Caesar defeated the Gallictribes under Vercingetorix. (The latter even appears in Asterix.) The druidswere clearly aware of the sacred nature of this “star point of Alaise.”image [../images/f0076-01.jpg]67image [../images/f0078-01.jpg]68Xavier Guichard traced the root of the word “Alaise” back to the Greek Elysion.Elysion (Greek) or Elysium (Latin) is regarded in Greek mythology as the Islandof the Blessed. The heroes beloved of the gods were taken to Elysion—immortalfor eternity. And today? Elysium is celebrated in the European anthem. In 1972,the Council of Europe and, in 1986, the European Union decided to adopt the “Odeto Joy” as the European anthem. The text is by the German poet philosopher,historian, and playwright Friedrich Schiller (1759–1805) and the music by noless a composer than Ludwig von Beethoven (1770–1827):Freude, schöner Götterfunke,Tochter aus Elysium,Wir betreten feuertrunken,Himmlische, dein Heiligtum.Deine Zauber binden wieder,Was die Mode strenggeteilt,Alle Menschen werden Brüder,Wo dein sanfter Flügel weilt.Joy, beautiful spark of the gods,Daughter of Elysium,In fiery intoxication we enter,Heavenly one, thy holy sanctuary.Thy magic power reunitesWhat custom has strictly parted,All human beings become brothersUnder thy gentle wing.The village of Alaise today consists of just 20 houses and an 11th centurychurch, a sleepy farming village in the French Jura. (Image 66) There are theremains of Gaulish fortifications on the hills around Alaise. (Images 67–68) Butwhat was there that needed defending in Alaise? The village historian, MonsieurLouis Courlet, explained to me that there were ancient graves from the Iron andBronze Ages around Alaise which had often been robbed by earlier inhabitants.The graves contained tools and jewelry—a valuable raw material for theproduction of weapons. Today’s inhabitants of Alaise and the surroundingvillages know about the unique nature of the “star point” Alaise, and they knowabout the lines that converge on the village from all directions—yet no one hasan explanation for the mystery. Courlet, who has written down the history of thevillage with incredible hard work and meticulousness,6[ch05_note.html#ch03note6a] expressed the view in a personal conversation thatthe secret of the lines probably had to be seen as one of the riddles ofprehistory. Indeed, Monsieur Courlet has a small exhibition in two rooms inAlaise, which he is happy to show to tourists. Yet tourists rarely find theirway to Alaise. Invisible lines cannot be looked at.Human beings have been discovering things from the beginning. Behind everyhorizon, there is new knowledge; behind every molecule, new combinations ofatoms; behind every atom, new sub-atomic particles, new waves. Human beings arelearning to marvel again. One of these marveling people is the qualifiedengineer Peter Hentschel from Dresden, a man with patience, perseverance, andclear, analytical reason. Some years ago he spent some months with a friend inTuscany in Italy and had no inkling of the mysterious lines in the landscapewhich would suddenly fascinate him, had no clue that he would be unexpectedlystudying the Etruscans and even the Tree of Life of the Jewish Kabbalah. PeterHentschel is a specialist in surveying. He thinks scientifically. The Etruscansand Kabbalah have about as much to do with his specialist area as an anteaterwith a crater on the moon. But things did not turn out as expected.Engineer Hentschel was asked to help with the renovation of an old country housein Tuscany. A 12th-century church is part of the house, and it stands on theremains of an Etruscan cultic site. His friend drew his attention to a curiosityof the region. There was a straight line between the town of Anghiari (famousfor the battle of Anghiari), the town of Arezzo, and a Franciscan monastery onMonte Casale. Part of the line is the straight road from Anghiari to San Polcro.What was that about? To begin with, Peter Hentschel shook his head in disbeliefbut then discovered confirmation in the landscape. A check with his GPS and acomputer specially programmed for spherical trigonometry confirmed theinformation from his friend. But then he began to wonder. The monastery ofLaverna lay at right angles to the north of Anghiari. It was the place at whichSt Francis of Assisi (1182–1226) received the stigmata. Strange. Had theFranciscan monks set up their monasteries in a geometrical pattern? Things wereto become even more strange. Once again at right angles and at the same distancethere was Petroja, a church of the Templars. Now the engineer’s curiosity wasaroused. Were there still other churches, chapels, or holy sites at the samedistances?image [../images/f0082-01.jpg]69Peter Hentschel consulted maps and went to inspect his ever-more-curiousdiscoveries on the ground with GPS and a digital camera. Gradually a system madeup of a whole lot of equilateral triangles over the landscape crystalized, inwhich a distance of 74 kilometers, or exactly half of that, lay between onepoint and the next. The places were partly ancient Etruscan sites which hadbelonged to the 12-city Etruscan League, chapels, shrines to the Madonna, orremains of Etruscan walls. The Christian chapels often stood on the remains ofEtruscan holy sites. An example: The distance from Cortona to a Bronze Agesettlement on Lake Bolsena is 74 kilometers. A straight line can be drawn fromboth places to Paganaico. Both distances are, in turn, 74 kilometers. There areMarian chapels, Romanesque churches, or the remains of Etruscan walls at thesepoints.Often the distance from one point to another was 37 kilometers—half the distanceof 74 kilometers. Peter Hentschel, the engineer specialising in surveying,transferred his findings to a map, which I reproduced with his permission. Theresult was a grid of more than 12 equidistant points. The whole system has astrict north–south orientation. (Places such as San Cristoforo, Corton, Cittadella Pieve, Perugia, Todi, Orte, and Blera lie at the nodes.) And the middleline of this network lies precisely on the 12th parallel east. The image whichwas reproduced on the map was very like the Tree of Life in the Kabbalah. Whatis the Kabbalah’s Tree of Life? (Images 69–70)The word “Kabbalah” comes from the Hebrew qabal, “receive.” (Hebrew QBLH means“what is received.”) It may be that the content of the Kabbalah even goes backto Moses, as is claimed in Kabbalistic circles, but a fragment of the Kabbalahwas written down by Rabbi Simon Bar Jochai (AD 130–170) as late as the secondcentury AD. A thousand years later, the Spanish Jew Moses Ben Schemtob de Leonprepared the version which we have today as the comprehensive text of theKabbalah.7 [ch05_note.html#ch03note7a] It has been translated into severallanguages. According to these Kabbalistic writings, God revealed himself throughemanations throughout the universe. The manifestations of God are called“Sephirot” and presented pictorially in a system which is called the“Kabbalistic Tree.”8 [ch05_note.html#ch03note8a] This “Tree” shows all themystical spheres of the divine forces “and is an allegorical image of the formof the heavenly and perfect human being.”9 [ch05_note.html#ch03note9a]Peter Hentschel’s triangles in Tuscany reflect exactly this Kabbalistic Tree ofLife. Coincidence? Who in the past would have had the power toimage [../images/f0084-01.jpg]70plant such an over-dimensional image, consisting of sacred corner points, intothe landscape? The question remains unanswered. During the eight years he spentstudying this astonishing geometry, Peter Hentschel quite separately discovereda highly puzzling geometrical network spread across the whole of central Italywhich definitively had to be older than the brothers of the Franciscan order.They did not locate their holy places by accident, in any old place, but kept tothe existing sacred points from the time of the Etruscans.Central Italy was the land of the Etruscans about 3,000 years ago. Where theycame from has not been explained to the present day. Herodotus, the Greek“father of history,” reports that the Etruscans were migrants from Lydia in AsiaMinor.10 [ch05_note.html#ch03note10a] As early as in the eighth century BC, theEtruscans maintained intensive trade with Greece, and their religion wasdefinitely influenced by the Greek world of the gods. Their priests knew thedivine symbols and possessed, in particular, very precise surveying skills.Their urns were accordingly decorated with geometrical motifs. But the knowledgeof the Etruscan priests about geometry came from ancient Greece. This claim canbe proved easily.Here are the facts I have reported on several occasions without ever havingreceived a response from the scientific establishment.11[ch05_note.html#ch03note11a], 12 [ch05_note.html#ch03note12a], 13[ch05_note.html#ch03note13a]In the autumn of 1974, I gave a lecture to the Rotary Club in Athens. At the endof the discussion, a bald gentleman with graying temples approached me andenquired politely whether I was aware that most of the Greek holy sites wereconnected in a geometrical relationship. I smiled and said I found thatdifficult to imagine because the ancient Greeks did not, after all, possessgeodetic surveying techniques. Furthermore, I objected, the temples were oftenmany kilometers apart and the Greek mountains meant there was no direct line ofsight between one holy site and another. Finally, I considered in a know-it-allmanner, the classical sites were also on islands hundreds of kilometers distantfrom the mainland and cannot be seen with the naked eye in any case. I wasthinking of the distance to Crete or Izmir, Turkey, the Smyrna of the Stone Age.So, what was the friendly gentleman going on about?We met again two days later, this time at the military airport of Athens. Mapsand aeronautical charts had been spread out on a large table. The bald gentlemanintroduced himself: Dr Theophanias Manias, brigadier in the Greek air force. Whywas this military big cheese interested in archaeology? He explained it to meover a cup of tea.image [../images/f0086-01.jpg]71image [../images/f0086-02.jpg]72image [../images/f0087-01.jpg]73image [../images/f0087-02.jpg]74image [../images/f0088-01.jpg]75image [../images/f0088-02.jpg]76It was normal practice, he said, for the military pilots to undertakesurveillance and training flights in the mountains or target practice over thesea. Afterward, they had to prepare a report which also recorded fuelconsumption. In the course of the years, a lieutenant who had transferred thedata into a table noticed that the same fuel quantities and distances kept beingcited, although the pilots had flown in different areas. The lieutenant thoughthe had discovered a fiddle. The pilots were too lazy to enter the correctinformation in their log books, and so they copied from one another. Thus thedossier ended up on the desk of Colonel Manias. (He only became brigadier at alater date.)Mr. Manias took dividers, placed the point on Delphi, and drew a circle over theAcropolis. Curiously, the circle also touched Argos and Olympia. Then thebrigadier placed the tip of the dividers on Knossos in Crete. The circle alsotouched Sparta und Epidaurus—strange. Center of the circle Delos: Thebes andIzmir also lay on it. Center of the circle Paros: Knossos and Chalcis also layon it. Center of the circle Sparta: Mycenae and the classical oracle ofTrofonion also lay on it.Dr. Manias handed me three documents in English, Spanish, and German, all withthe same content.14 [ch05_note.html#ch03note14a], 15[ch05_note.html#ch03note15a], 16 [ch05_note.html#ch03note16a] They had beenprepared with the active support of the military geographic office in Athens andpublished by the Association for Operational Research. From them I learned andanyone can check (Images 71–76 “Goldener Schnitt” is the golden ratio.):• The distance between the cultic sites of Delphi and Epidaurus corresponds tothe larger section of the golden ratio for the distance from Epidaurus to Delos,specifically 62%.• The distance between Olympia and Chalkis corresponds to the larger section ofthe golden ratio for the distance from Olympia to Delos, specifically 62%.• The distance between Delphi and Thebes corresponds to the larger section ofthe golden ratio for the distance from Delphi to the Acropolis, specifically62%.• The distance between Delphi and Olympia corresponds to the larger section ofthe golden ratio for the distance from Olympia to Chalcis, specifically 62%.• The distance between Epidaurus and Sparta corresponds to the larger section ofthe golden ratio for the distance from Epidaurus to Olympia, specifically 62%.image [../images/f0090-01.jpg]77• The distance between Delos and Eleusis corresponds to the larger section ofthe golden ratio for the distance from Delos to Delphi, specifically 62%.• The distance between Knossos and Delos corresponds to the larger section ofthe golden ratio for the distance from Knossos to Chalcis, specifically 62%.• The distance between Delphi and Dodoni corresponds to the larger section ofthe golden ratio for the distance from Delphi to the Acropolis, specifically62%.• The distance between Sparta and Olympia corresponds to the larger section ofthe golden ratio for the distance from Sparta to the Acropolis, specifically62%.Yet there is method in this madness. What is the probability that in mountainousterrain three temples happen to lie on a straight line? It might happen in twoor three cases. In Attica and Boeotia (central Greece) alone there are 35 ofthese “three-temple lines.” Tuscany salutes!What is the probability that the linear distances between holy sites is thesame? It happens 22 times in central Greece. Coincidence? Hardly.And Delphi, the “navel of the world,” plays the role of the hub airport in thisnetwork. Thus Delphi is the same distance from the Acropolis and Olympia. We canconstruct a perfect equilateral triangle. The holy site of Nemea lies at thehalf-way point of the cathetus (one of the two shorter legs of a right-angledtriangle). The right-angled triangles of Acropolis–Delphi–Nemea andNemea–Delphi–Olympia have the same hypotenuse, and its ratio to the commonDelphi–Nemea line corresponds to the golden ratio.And now things get even more peculiar: the distance from Delphi to Aphea is thesame as from Aphea to Sparta. The distance from Delphi to Sparta is the same asthe distance from Sparta to Thebes and—incidentally—also half the distance ofthe line from Dodoni to Sparta and Dodoni to the Acropolis. The distances arealso the same for Delphi–Mycenae and Mycenae–Athens or Delphi–Gortys (amegalithic ruin on Crete) and Delphi–Milet in Asia Minor. In summary, Delphi isgeodetically and geometrically related to Olympia, Dodoni, Eleusis, Epidaurus,Aphea, the Acropolis, Sparta, Mycenae, Thebes, Chalcis, Nemea, Kinyra, Gortys,and Milet.image [../images/f0093-01.jpg]78To complete this madness, we still need to swallow the following: Everyone canimagine an equilateral triangle. But in ancient Greece, there is evidence ofseveral triangles with two proportions relating to the different leg lengths. Itworks as follows. Take the triangle Dodoni–Delphi–Sparta: the places have thesame leg ratio as Dodoni–Sparta to Dodoni–Delphi, Dodoni–Sparta toSparta–Delphi, and Dodoni–Delphi to Delphi–Sparta.The triangle Knossos–Delos–Chalcis: the places have the same leg ratio asKnossos–Chalcis to Knossos–Delos, Knossos–Chalkis to Chalkis–Delos, andKnossos–Delos to Delos–Chalkis.The triangle Nicosia (Cyprus)–Knossos (Crete)–Dodoni: the places have the sameleg ratio as Nicosia–Dodoni to Nicosia–Knossos, Nicosia–Dodoni toDodoni–Knossos, and Nikosia zu Knossos–Dodoni.All these triangles are the same. With the assistance of the military geographicoffice, more than 200 geometric equivalent ratios were nailed down. Anadditional 148 proportions based on the golden ratio can be added to them. Tokeep talking about coincidence is absurd. After all, we are not just talkingabout names on a map but cultic sites from antiquity—or to be precise,prehistory. Thus the temple of Apollo in classical Delphi stands on foundationsfrom the Stone Age. (Images 77–79)image [../images/f0094-01.jpg]79Professor Fritz Rogowski from the Technical University in Brunswick was the onlyacademic far and wide to want to try and crack this nut of a puzzle. He didindeed find small stone circles here and there in the mountainous terrain ofGreece. He looked around for further markers and, lo and behold, in severalcases he discovered a second stone circle just within view.17[ch05_note.html#ch03note17a] Rogowski extended the lines of the marker pointsand—in multiple cases (!)—landed on a cultic site at the end of such a chain.Had the nut been cracked?No. The lines in the Greece of antiquity bridged not just mountain ranges butalso sea routes. One line of the Delphi–Olympia–Acropolis triangle bridges a20-kilometer-long track across the sea. The same applies to Dodoni–Sparta. Itbecomes patently absurd in triangles such as Knossos–Delos–Argos. About 300kilometers of sea lie between Knossos on Crete and Argos—not bridgeable with thenaked eye.18 [ch05_note.html#ch03note18a]The clever academics of our day adhere to the principle of “simple probability,”the “most obvious solutions.” This principle prohibits them from any other wayof thinking. They cannot escape from their thought prison, because with the“most obvious solution,” the problem has been dealt with. What else is there toinvestigate? This method, even if it is declared to be infallible by science,only provides half-answers for any but the most superficial problems. One ofthese non-solutions which lulls these minds happily to sleep is derived from theknowledge of the mathematicians of Greek antiquity. Euclid lived in thethird/fourth century BC and gave lectures in Egypt and Greece. He compiledseveral textbooks both on the full range of mathematics and on all of geometry,including proportions. Euclid was a contemporary of the philosopher Plato andhe, in turn, was intermittently active as a politician. Thus Plato is said tohave sat at the feet of Euclid and listened to his discourses on geometry. Is itnot obvious that Plato was inspired by the explanations of the mathematicalgenius Euclid and made use of this geometrical knowledge when he discussedbuilding projects in his capacity as a politician?image [../images/f0095-01.jpg]80This honorable intellectual approach is worthless because all the sacred siteswhich come into question existed long before Euclid. Their origins go back farinto prehistoric times, even for “ancient Greece.” That applies to theAcropolis, Delos, Mycenae, and Epidaurus as much as to Knossos on Crete. Everyplace was originally megalithic. (Images 80–85) At best, Euclid was passing onknowledge which was much older than he was himself. That is something which thefew academics who study the mathematics of antiquity also know. ProfessorNeugebauer has compared Platonic geometry with Euclidean, and the latter withthe geometry of Egypt and Assur.19 [ch05_note.html#ch03note19a] His colleagueProfessor Jean Richter discovered a geometry in the temple layout in ancientGreece which had long been in existence in pre-Euclidean times.20[ch05_note.html#ch03note20a] The brilliant Greek mathematicians cannot have hadanything to do with the geometrical arrangement of the holy sites because theselocations were already sacred long before these mathematicians were born.Euclid, Plato, Pythagoras, and Socrates cannot help us further here. But wheredid this geometrical knowledge come from and why did the “ancient Greeks”arrange their sacred sites in accordance with geometrical patterns and equaldistances? Plato—Euclid’s listener—mentions whole series of geometricalconnections in chapters seven and eight of his work Timaeus. He knew about thevast distances extending far beyond Greece and therefore warned, “Let no oneignorant of geometry have a say in this matter. Geometry is the knowledge ofeternal existence.”21 [ch05_note.html#ch03note21a]image [../images/f0096-01.jpg]81The facts are clear to see: precise, applied geometry in the thousands ofmenhirs near the town of Carnac in Brittany (a2+b2=c2). Precise, appliedgeometry in the so-called ley lines which run across Europe. Precise, appliedgeometry not just in Franconia (Germany) but throughout Germany and beyond.Precise, applied geometry over a large territorial network of holy and secularpoints in Tuscany. Precise, applied geometry both in France and in ancientBritain. As long ago as 1870, the historian Henry Black, a member of the BritishArchaeological Association in London, declared, “Monuments exist marking grandgeometrical lines, lines which cover the whole of the west of Europe, extendingbeyond Britain to Ireland, the Hebrides, the Shetlands, the Orkneys, right up tothe Arctic circle.... [This system] exists in India, China and in the provincesof the east which are all laid out in the same way.”22[ch05_note.html#ch03note22a] Precise geometry over the prehistoric temples inGreece. And this is only the tip of the iceberg. The New Zealander Bruce Cathie,professional pilot and former captain of a DC-8, in two books establishes agiant network of ancient lines which spread across the globe.23[ch05_note.html#ch03note23a], 24 [ch05_note.html#ch03note24a] A comparablenetwork of lines also lies over South America. Books have been written aboutthat which no one knows about.25 [ch05_note.html#ch03note25a], 26[ch05_note.html#ch03note26a], 27 [ch05_note.html#ch03note27a], 28[ch05_note.html#ch03note28a] I myself deal with the subject in Die Steinzeit warganz anders, p. 249ff. (The Stone Age was quite different).We might be able to explain these things if the Stone Age people had somehow andsomewhere marked their territories. But this simple explanation does not work.Just try measuring a straight line of 74 kilometers in dense forest overgrownwith roots, ferns, and trees—and, moreover, in hilly terrain. In recentcenturies, these areas were surveyed from one triangulation point (triangle) tothe next; today it is done from the air or with satellites. What resources didthe grunting prehistoric humans possess? And why, for heaven’s sake, did ourancestors, who had hardly mutated into Homo sapiens, survey their lands bothnorth and south of the Alps (Tuscany)? A tunnel through the Swiss Alps did notexist at the time, and the Alps were covered in mighty glaciers. Why did theprehistoric Greeks practice the identical surveying skills in their mountainousland and over maritime distances of 300 kilometers? Why the planning games withgeometry also on the remote British islands?It is time to prick up our ears. Who is responsible for the geometric grid overour countries? Who surveyed the earth millennia ago? That even includes a surveyof Antarctica. We know about it from the charts of the Turkish admiral PiriReis. In 1513, he had created a new chart from more ancient ones he had found inAlexandria, and the coastline of Antarctica has clearly been included on it,including all the offshore islands. An Antarctic, remember, which did not existat the time of Piri Reis because Antarctica, still covered in ice today, wasunknown in 1513. (There is a more detailed explanation in Im Namen von Zeus.29[ch05_note.html#ch03note29a])image [../images/f0098-01.jpg]82I am aware that this whole business of incomprehensible geometric facts iswearing on the nerves. It sounds somehow exotic, far-fetched; our reason refusesto accept what is clearly there. Our thinking shuts down in the face of theprehistoric land survey. We know that there was never a “megalithic people,”that a “worldwide kingdom” never existed, that our “Stone Agers” did notmaintain contact with one another over thousands of kilometers, that there wereno global means of transport. And yet these facts undeniably lie right in frontof our eyes. In order to come to grips with this incredible reality, we firsthave to jettison all preconceptions, be they from politics, religion, orscience. Our scientific thinking keeps to scientific rules that the Britishstatesman Sir Francis Bacon (1561–1626) formulated almost 400 years ago. FrancisBacon was a controversial and combative figure. He was considered conceited,well-read, boundlessly ambitious, and, for good measure, devoid of feelings. Hewas—rightly—annoyed by the un-scientific attitudes and superstitions of histime. Hence in his work Novum Organum, he demanded experiments that could bereplicated at any time. Knowledge was a way to achieve power, for Francis Bacon.(“Knowledge is power.”) On the path to knowledge, all illusions (so-calledidols) had to be avoided. The whole of science still keeps to this maxim today.It has brought us magnificent results, but at the same time ensured thatnumerous subject have never been tackled at all.Then, in 1975, philosopher of science Professor Paul Feyerabend, who taught atthe University of California, Berkeley, for a long time, published his “anythinggoes” approach.30 [ch05_note.html#ch03note30a] His hypothesis contradicted theidea of a continuous process of finding scientific truth as had been demanded byFrancis Bacon. Feyerabend postulated that a scientific method could only producethe result permitted by that method. In fact, many scientific innovationsoccurred precisely through not observing methodological rules but by breakingthem. We need both: Francis Bacon and Paul Feyerabend.The fact that huge swathes of land were surveyed in prehistoric times calls forthe thinking of a Paul Feyerabend. Our logic continues to be puny; we do notdare to lift our gaze beyond our own navels. We are basically in the process ofwaking up and are laboriously keeping our eyes shut. It is high time toinvestigate the motives that lie behind the surveyed facts of our prehistory.And to do so without any restrictions. “Anything goes!”31[ch05_note.html#ch03note31a]image [../images/f0101-01.jpg]83Who did the survey work millennia ago? Why? By what means? Here are a bunch ofoff-the-cuff thoughts:• Feng shui, the Chinese teaching of magnetic fields?• Electrostatic fields?• Magnetism?• Infrared? Ultrasound?• Microwaves?• Cosmic radiation?• Ant or termite mounds?• Geomancy?• Old paths?• Mineral or water veins?image [../images/f0102-01.jpg]84• Border markings?• Gaia? (The earth as a living being, wherein the lines are its veins.)32[ch05_note.html#ch03note32a]• A grid to control and influence human beings?Nothing seems to fit. The magnetic fields of feng shui do not just run instraight and rectangular lines, but also in curves. The same applies to mineraland water veins and all the other types of field. Border markings acrossthousands of kilometers and across the sea do not fit with the “Stone Agers.”They would, in any case, have run their borders along water courses. Ants andtermites do not build their nests along straight lines either. Now it isundisputed that the survey points in Greece are definitively older than Euclidand Plato. The “Stone Agers” which we learned about in school are ruled out inany case. They simply were not globally active.Perplexity is the word for “bewildered,” “poleaxed.” Perplexity sets in whenthinking has reached a dead end. What are we to do? What happens next? Who, forheaven’s sake, surveyed ancient Greece x-thousand years ago? Negating facts isunscientific in the profoundest sense of the word.Plato expressly notes in his book Timaeus (Chapters 7 and 8) that thesegeometric relationships were based on accounts several thousands of years old.From whom? The ancient Chinese report that at the time of the Emperor Fuk Hi “amonster with the body of a horse and the head of a dragon” had appeared out ofthe waters of the Meng Ho River.33 [ch05_note.html#ch03note33a] The speakingmonster carried large diagrams of the cosmos and the earth on its back.Something similar is reported by the Babylonian priest Berossus (c. 350 BC) inhis Babylonica. A being called “Oannes” had risen from the waters of theErythraean Sea (today known as the Arabian Sea) and had instructed human beingsin all things, including how to survey land. The same teacher is called Yma inthe holy book of the Parsees, the Avesta.34 [ch05_note.html#ch03note34a] Eventhe God of the Old Testament explains to the patient prophet Job, “Where wastthou when I laid the foundations of the earth?...Who has laid the measuresthere-of?...Who hath stretched the line upon it?” (Job 38: 4–5)We people of today survey the earth for quite practical purposes. How far ispoint A from point B? How long does it take to get there? Air routes would beimpossible without a global system of coordinates. Were there flyers inantiquity, far superior to the ordinary people? A stupid idea? Almost 30 yearsago, Dr. Dileep Kumar Kanjilal, professor at the Sanskrit College in Calcutta,underpinned precisely this hypothesis with a thorough analysis.35[ch05_note.html#ch03note35a] (I was permitted to reproduce a section of his workon flying machines in ancient India in a previous book.36[ch05_note.html#ch03note36a]) Kanjilal provides evidence for everything hewrites from the correct sources. It can be checked by every expert. A shortextract follows:The Rigveda contains well-known hymns which are addressed to the divine “Ashvin”twins, the “Rbhus,” and other gods. These hymns contain the first indications ofvehicles which were capable of flying through the air with living beings onboard. These flying vehicles are described in the Rigveda as “Rathas.” The wordcan be translated analogously as “vehicles” or “chariots.” The “Rbhus” built aflying chariot for the “Ashvin” twins who were considered to be the physiciansamong the gods. This flying chariot was extremely comfortable. It was possibleto fly everywhere with it, even above the highest cloud layers and into the“heavens” (firmament). The hymns mention that this flying chariot was fasterthan thought. At least three persons were required to operate it.... Theheavenly war chariot as described was fuelled with liquids which cannot becorrectly translated today. The words “madhu” and “anna” come closest in meaningto “honey” and “liquid.” The chariot moved through the sky with greater easethan a bird, swept up toward the sun and even as far as the moon, and landed onearth with a great noise... When the vehicle came down from the clouds greatcrowds gathered on the ground to watch the landing....37[ch05_note.html#ch03note37a]Without precise maps, the pilots of such flying machines would not have knownwhere on earth their favorites or their enemies were located. Even the legendaryKing Solomon possessed a “chariot which traveled through the air and which hehad made in accordance with the wisdom lent him by God.”38[ch05_note.html#ch03note38a] If we read the most ancient Ethiopian account, theKebra Nagast, then Solomon “covered a distance of three months in one day on hisflying machine, without sickness and suffering, without hunger and thirst,without sweat and exhaustion.”39 [ch05_note.html#ch03note39a] Hardly surprisingthat such a skilled pilot had to possess excellent aerial charts. Arabia’s mostimportant geographer and encyclopaedist, Al-Mas’udi (895–956) wrote in hisHistories that Solomon had owned maps which showed “the heavenly bodies, thestars, the earth with its continents and oceans, the inhabited regions, itsplants and animals and many other amazing things.”40[ch05_note.html#ch03note40a]image [../images/f0106-01.jpg]85The finding that at least large parts of our earth had already been surveyed inprehistoric times is clearly verifiable. By whom? Why? Nowadays we not onlysurvey the whole planet with satellites, determine the heights of mountains anddepths of the oceans, but small surfaces such as a finger tip or face can alsobe registered. A grid made up of squares is laid over the face despite theirregularities of nose and eyes. They can be enlarged or reduced, and everydetail in the corresponding square can be called up. Reassembled, we have thewhole face again. Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World41 [ch05_note.html#ch03note41a]has become reality thanks to this technology of grid squares. Surveillancecameras observe crowds in railway stations, streets, stadiums, or at passportcontrol. Every face is recorded by the camera and disassembled into smallsquares by a computer in seconds. If all the details fit with the image of awanted person, there is a direct hit. The authorities now know the location ofthe person concerned.The things we can do today, the things we will be able to do the day aftertomorrow, was already old hat for the gods millennia ago. They operated AldousHuxley’s surveillance system to perfection. Precise maps were essential whenthey flew on earth—and grid squares for keeping an eye on their creatures. Isuspect the system is still working today. As recently as 25 years ago, theradio astronomer Professor Ronald Bracewell of Stanford University, developedhis hypothesis of “super galactic communities.” This club only admits maturesocieties; all the others are monitored.42 [ch05_note.html#ch03note42a] And hiscolleague, Professor James Deardorff, went one disturbing step further with his“zoo hypothesis.”43 [ch05_note.html#ch03note43a] According to this idea, theearth is viewed by the extraterrestrials as a refuge, a kind of “zoologicalgarden.” The prerequisite for the proper working of a zoo is the goodwill of thekeepers and the zoo visitors. Thus visitors are prohibited from destroying thenesting sites of rare birds, feeding live dogs to crocodiles, provoking lions,or stealing poisonous snakes. All the visitors to the zoo must observe therules. The animals are exclusively for looking at and, for the study of theirdevelopment. The keepers for their part maintain a very close watch that therules are observed and they know, of course, which species among the animalspossesses greater intelligence than the rest: human beings. The keepers alsoknow that it is only a matter of time before human beings have developed thetechnologies to break out of their zoo. Should they be allowed to do that? Arehuman beings perhaps a danger to keepers and zoo visitors? Is humanity beingmonitored, from millennia ago to the present day?This thought might appear totally fanciful at first sight. We, the crowningglory of creation, the apex of evolution, nothing more than the most advancedapes in a global zoo? It is worth considering something which appears ascompletely ridiculous as that, as the following example shows.On March 24, 1967, First Lieutenant Robert Salas of the U.S. Air Force was onduty at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. A message came through that anelliptical, red object was hovering over the Oscar Flight control center. TheOscar Flight control center is not any old Air Force base, but a top-secret sitebecause that is where intercontinental missiles mounted with nuclear warheadsare kept in underground silos. While First Lieutenant Salas phoned the basecommander, “the warning lights for the missiles went out one after the other onthe status console, which meant that the missiles were deactivated.”44[ch05_note.html#ch03note44a] Not a single missile could be started any longer;all had dropped off. And this happened while the missiles were 18 metersunderground in their silos, and each missile was 1.5 kilometers away from thenext one. Moreover, each silo had its own independent power supply and controland switching circuits. The same thing had already happened a week previously onthe morning of March 16, 1967, at the Echo Flight base 45 kilometers away. Atotal of 20 intercontinental missiles had been immobilized.These and similar cases are reported by the science journalist Leslie Kean inher recent book UFOs: Generals, Pilots and Government Officials Break TheirSilence.45 [ch05_note.html#ch03note45a] But is it not precisely the largenations that have closed their UFO offices? Is it not the Americans and Britishwho no longer want to spend money on the registration of stupid, useless UFOdocuments? Correct! The real reason for this action is not, however, the reasonwhich the public is fed. It is not about a lack of credibility among thewitnesses, not about the lack of interest in the media, not about theunscientific nature of the whole subject, not about the validity of thedocumentation, including numerous film and radar documents. It is, plain andsimple, the recognition that we human beings cannot do anything about it; anadmission of our total impotence with regard to the UFO phenomenon. What isthere to tell the public? You are all under surveillance? We are the inhabitantsof a global zoo and totally impotent against our keepers?There is even a positive side to the whole shebang. The superpowers would nothave been able to destroy our refuge or pollute it with nuclear contamination.The keepers would have prevented it.Grid squares or sectors would be very sensible for the total automaticmonitoring of the zoo. A diagonal line drawn through a square turns it into twotriangles. What did Horus, the divine son of Osiris and Isis say? The eye ofHorus keeps watch. In modern times: God sees all. Whoever God might be."},{"pageContent":"FALSE DOCTRINESAbydos lies 561 kilometers south of Cairo, directly on the Nile. The Egyptiansof the Old Kingdom (2600–2200 BC) were already doing archaeology there: “Theyturned over the ground.”1 [ch05_note.html#ch04note1a] What they were looking forat that time is just as unknown as the origins of Abydos. Today it is thetemples of Sethos I (1294–1279 BC) and his son Ramses II (1279–1213 BC) thatdominate the scene. (Images 86–87) But the temple complex of Sethos I partiallyrests on foundations from those mythical times of which we know nothing.Directly behind the temple there is the so-called Osireion, a complexconstructed from giant granite blocks which, looked at from a technologicalperspective, does not fit in with the Sethos temple, whichever way you look atit.As long ago as 1726, when no official department of archaeology yet existed, theFrenchman Granger (real name Tourtechot) started digging in Abydos. At thattime, the whole complex lay under the desert sands and only a few uprightcolumns signaled a structure under the surface. The next Frenchman to burrow inAbydos, Emile Amélineau, discovered tombs from the First and Second Dynasty,about 5,000 years in the past when calculated from today. In 1859, when Abydoshad been buried by the desert again, Auguste Mariette, the subsequent founder ofthe Egyptian Museum in Cairo, had Abydos shoveled free again. Eventually theBritons Sir Flinders Petrie and Margaret Murray undertook research in Abydos in1903, and in 1912, the famous Swiss Egyptologist Professor Edouard Naville(1844–1926) discovered a granite stone gateway in the ground with varioussubterranean chambers. Naville investigated the up to 100-tonne granite blocksof the Osireion and finally concluded with resignation that this complex had tobe considered as the “oldest structure in the whole of Egypt.”2[ch05_note.html#ch04note2a] (Images 88–91)image [../images/f0112-01.jpg]86The Osireion lies 15 meters below the level of the temple of Sethos I andconsists of massive granite blocks without any ornamentation—comparable with themegaliths of Stonehenge in southern England. Why is the complex called“Osireion”? Because according to legend, the head of the heavenly god Osiris issaid to be hidden there. Osiris is equivalent to Orion. He originally came fromthat constellation. He studied humans, taught them, and was—similar to the GreekApollo and Peruvian Viracocha—a helpful god. It was Osiris who traveledthroughout the world and taught human beings agriculture, respect for oneanother, and, particularly, the magic power of music and song. But Osiris had ajealous brother, Seth. He wanted the earth and all its people for himself, andso he treacherously murdered his brother, Osiris. In order to prevent him evercoming back to life, Seth cut up the body of Osiris into 14 pieces and buriedthe different parts of the body in different places—the backbone in Busiris, aleg in Philae, the phallus in Mendes, and the most important part of the body,the head, in Abydos—hence “the Osireion.” The head of the god Osiris has notbeen found in Abydos to the present day. And that is unlikely to change, becauseOsiris, like his mystical companions, belongs to the clan of theextraterrestrials. They are reported about in the so-called Pyramid Texts fromthe Fifth and Sixth Dynasty, whereby it remains an open question how long thetexts were already in existence before someone chiselled them into the granite.These texts are full of gods who descend to earth from the heavens, and ofpharaohs who were accorded the honor of visiting the world of the gods. As theconfused spirit of our times only sees abstract thinking behind the PyramidTexts, our gullible academics from the last century conjured wishful thinkingand dreams of the priests into these texts or the journey of the pharaoh afterdeath.The Pyramid Text of Pepi I equates Osiris with the constellation of Orion: “See,Osiris comes as Orion, heaven has conceived you in Orion, you were born withOrion....”3 [ch05_note.html#ch04note3a] In the Pyramid Texts of Unas (2356–2323BC) also, Osiris journeys to the “heavenly way.”4 [ch05_note.html#ch04note4a](Images 92–97) He is, like Horus, an “inhabitant of the horizon” who “pushes offfrom the earth” in his vessel, who (in verse 303) “ascends to heaven.”5[ch05_note.html#ch04note5a] Osiris originally clearly lives in fatefulheaven—but heaven is not the place of blessedness after death. The term “heaven”refers to space. I recommend that our hard-working Egyptologists, who are allsincerely translating Pyramid Texts, read the “Utterances” (verses) with modernglasses. The modern interpretation makes sense, as the following examples show:“Heaven trembles, the earth shakes before me, I possess magic powers. I havecome to worship Orion...” (Utt. 472)“A stairway to heaven has been set up for me so that I can ascend to heaven andI climbed up on the smoke of the large vessel... and thundered beyond heaven inyour barque. I am permitted to lift off the land in your barque...” (Utt 267)“The doors of the (?) which are in the firmament were opened for me, the metaldoors which are in starry heaven lie open for me...” (Utt. 584)“The prince descends from the inner horizon in a great storm...” (Utt. 669)6[ch05_note.html#ch04note6a]image [../images/f0114-01.jpg]87image [../images/f0116-01.jpg]88image [../images/f0116-02.jpg]89image [../images/f0117-01.jpg]90image [../images/f0117-02.jpg]91image [../images/f0118-01.jpg]92image [../images/f0118-02.jpg]93image [../images/f0119-01.jpg]94image [../images/f0119-02.jpg]95image [../images/f0120-01.jpg]96image [../images/f0120-02.jpg]97And so on. Heavenly doors are open, gods descend in smoke and fumes, pharaohsare allowed to fly along, there is thunder and noise on earth, the sand swirlsup and the perpetrators of the spectacle are always the gods, be it in ancientIndia, Tibet, Japan, in the Bible (Ezekiel), or elsewhere. Now we must not, theEgyptologists always tell us, compare such texts with any kind of reality. Thepharaoh’s journey to heaven after death is what is always meant. An honourableview—based on the hard work of prestigious Egyptologists—and yet amisunderstanding on a grand scale.Egypt, with all its original gods of Ra, Osiris, Isis, Horus, and so on, isconnected with the myths of other civilisations. Different names, similar deeds.The same applies to the connection between Sumer and Egypt. In Sumeriancuneiform scripts, there is a long report from the princess and high priestessEnheduanna, called the Temple Hymns of Enheduanna. They were created about 4,300years ago. The text has been translated by Sumerologists and made to fit apreconceived model, which is just as wrong as the Egyptian Pyramid Texts withthe alleged journey to heaven of the pharaohs after death. The specialist Dr.Hermann Burgard, who studied Sumerology for decades, who can read cuneiformwriting in the original and who knows the ancient texts and their interpreters,says that the Sumerologists are working “improperly and making untenableclaims.”7 [ch05_note.html#ch04note7a] Dr. Burgard translated the Temple Hymns ofEnheduanna8 [ch05_note.html#ch04note8a] and reached the absolutely convincingconclusion that all previous translations of the Temple Hymns are based onerroneous assumptions which are no longer tenable. Millennia ago, the princessand high priestess Enheduanna did not report about some psychologicallydressed-up circus of the gods, about underworlds and mythological drivel, butabout very real technical things, such as:• Ramps for flying machines.• Production of fuel.• Storage rooms for fuel.• Terrible explosions in which hundreds of people died.• Flying machines rising into the heavens.• Spaceships in orbit.• Radio traffic.• Refinement of scrap metals.• Metal alloys for flying machines.image [../images/f0122-01.jpg]98Dr. Herman Burgard’s work is the milestone, the breakthrough on the way to anappropriate contemporary translation. This is not some amateur spinning a yarn.Enheduanna’s Temple Hymns are analyzed by an expert who criticises theSumerologists for “sloppy writing or centuries of misunderstanding.”9[ch05_note.html#ch04note9a]I know of new translations from India10 [ch05_note.html#ch04note10a] in whichprofessors dared to clear up the old misconceptions with thorough specialistknowledge. Dr. Hermann Burgard’s translation of the Temple Hymns of Enheduannais just as much of a serious work, a textbook based on sound knowledge. I cansee light at the end of the tunnel.That Sethos I built the Osireion in Abydos is as likely as the moon being madeof cheese. Here—as in Pumapunku in the highlands of Bolivia—“gods” were at work.The specialists think that Sethos I had mighty blocks transported from Aswan toAbydos. The two locations are separated by about 400 kilometers of Nile,including rapids. (Today there are locks for the shipping.) Aswan granite is thehardest in the world. The heavy blocks, up to 100 tonnes in weight, would havehad to be polished at their destination. Before that, the ancient engineerswould have fitted the monoliths with recesses and notches in specific places sothat the upper and lower blocks could be precisely fitted into one another.(Images 98–99)image [../images/f0123-01.jpg]99Irritatingly, the building site was lower than the level of the Nile. Why thathad to be is a secret of the gods. So high-tech methods were used to prevent thewaters of the Nile from flooding the building site. The columns, which supportedthe whole thing, could not just be punched into the soft substrate. So afoundation made of megalithic slabs had to be provided, with notches toprecisely position the heavy blocks. (Images 100–101) Once they were securely inplace, this was followed by the absolute master stroke of the prehistoricplanners. Monster cranes, like those in the impressive 3D film Avatar, werebrought up, which lowered the massive crossbeams with meticulous precision ontothe granite columns. And it was done so that every notch fit exactly with itscounterpart.None of the Egyptologists who propagate such pseudo solutions appear to have thefaintest knowledge of engineering. Let us just remember the evolution oftechnology. Nothing simply exists. Everything has to be thought out, invented,planned, developed, built, and, finally, transported. Where—so help usOsiris!—are the actual workshops for the technologies which were used, where thedevelopmental history of the stone cutters, ropes, lifting platforms, ropewinches, rollers, and so on? The ancient Egyptians had hemp ropes, the expertstell us. That material is suitable, at best, for a towing capacity of 3 tonnes.But in Abydos, crossbeams weighing 30 tonnes were used. (Images 102–104) Howmany ropes would be required for loads like that? When does the pulling ropejump off the shaft? When do the bars on the capstans splinter? When does alifting platform collapse and chip the edges of the monoliths already cleanlyfitted below it? The monoliths of the Osireion of Abydos do not have a scratch.The workmen on the Osireion did not permit themselves a single error.image [../images/f0124-01.jpg]100image [../images/f0124-02.jpg]101image [../images/f0125-01.jpg]102image [../images/f0125-02.jpg]103All unnecessary, the experts reply, and point to the tomb of the OverlordDjehutihotep (c. 1870 BC). A picture on a wall there shows 170 men dragging astatue through the desert with ropes. And a tomb from the time of Amenemhet I(1991–1962 BC) even mentions ropes. There are even images of pulleys from theEighteenth Dynasty. But between the Abydos of the god Osiris (or the builders ofthe Great Pyramid) and the Eighteenth Dynasty there are about 600 years. If thetechnology of the Eighteenth Dynasty had been used in Abydos (and in the GreatPyramid), it would mean that the Egyptians had learnt nothing in a 600-yearperiod. And the technology of the Eighteenth Dynasty was useless for thecrossbeams of the Osireion in any case—too primitive for the precise cutting,too difficult for the crossbeams. Now the temple of Sethos I lies above theOsireion. So the Osireion must have been standing before Sethos was able tobuild his temple walls—walls, incidentally, in which smaller stones were layeredon top of one another. One does not have to be a genius to see it: the oldesttechnology of the Osireion, which lies under the Sethos temple, is mightier,more perfect, and more grandiose than the temple lying above it. According tothe evolution of technology, it should be precisely the other way round. In thelearning process, we start on a small scale; the monumental comes later astechnology develops.What was this Osireion for, in any case? It was allegedly a cenotaph (pseudotomb) for the god Osiris. Can the perspective get any narrower?We are too quickly satisfied with the first answer. Our knowledge is drippingwith complacency—because “we know it all.” The results of the exact sciences canbe tested at any time. But archaeology, which I greatly admire, is one of theinformation-gathering sciences. As such, it is open to reinterpretation at anytime. Precise science is something different.image [../images/f0127-01.jpg]104image [../images/f0128-01.jpg]105The Great Pyramid—all the experts agree on that—was built by Cheops (2551–2528BC). He belonged to the Fourth Dynasty. (Image 105–111) Is there anyone whobothers to query that in the 80 years in which the Fourth Dynasty ruled, about9,000,000 cubic meters of building volume was handled? That is for the pyramidsof Sneferu (2575–2551 BC), Cheops (2551–2528 BC), Djedefre (2528–2520 BC), andChefren (2520–2494 BC). In these 80 years—the experts believe—12,066,000 stoneblocks were quarried out of the rock, cut, polished, measured, transported, andinserted into the structure in the right place. It gets even better. Theexcavation and leveling work, the manufacture and repair of tools, theincredibly elaborate ramps and scaffolding, are not included in the more than 12million blocks. The whole of lower Egypt must have been a big building site, notto mention the material requirements and the provisions for the masses ofpeople. And the most absurd thing of all: neither the team of designers nor thearchitects, nor a foreman, priest, or pharaoh wasted any words on mentioning thebuilding work. The Egyptologist Dr. Eva Eggebrecht writes in this respect: “Thecontemporary silence about the construction of the pyramids becomesincomprehensible if we recall that the necropolises were not deathly silentcities of secrecy.... Sacrifices were made, priests came and went.... None ofthem left as much as a note which would answer even a single question about theconstruction of the pyramids.”11 [ch05_note.html#ch04note11a]But what if everything were quite different? If the men of the Fourth Dynastywere unable to say anything about the structures because there was nothing tosay? Were the buildings already dotted around in the landscape when the FourthDynasty began to rule?It is likely that more than 1,000 volumes have been written about the GreatPyramid. At least once a year, a manuscript lands on my desk, and each author isconvinced of having definitively cracked the “pyramid nut.” God knows these arenot cranks but down-to-earth, hard-working people, in many cases engineers whoare familiar with construction and surveying. Often they have sat at theircalculations and comparisons for years, experimented and, of course, deployedcomputers. And yet each one of these upright pyramid crackers comes to adifferent result. And none of them understand why their competitors do not reachthe same conclusions as themselves. A different logic rules in each brain. Now Iam neither an engineer nor a stone mason, and therefore do not even start tograpple with the phenomenon of the technology which was used to build thepyramids. As a lateral thinker and someone who knows classical literature, otherinconsistencies and contradictions catch my eye which simply cannot be ignored.Let me start with the Grand Gallery in the Cheops pyramid.image [../images/f0131-01.jpg]106image [../images/f0132-01.jpg]107image [../images/f0134-01.jpg]108image [../images/f0135-01.jpg]109image [../images/f0135-02.jpg]110image [../images/f0136-01.jpg]111image [../images/f0137-01.jpg]112The Grand Gallery is a miracle of construction which is difficult to digest. Itis an extended space which is about 47 meters long and 8.5 meters high, runningupwards at an angle to the so-called King’s Chamber. (Image 112) The granitebeams opposite one another do not lie horizontally. No, like an extra slap inthe face for us clever clogs, the monoliths slope upward at the same inclinationas the Grand Gallery. The beams and slabs have been worked with such precisionthat it is difficult to see any joints. (Image 113) The architects of the Cheopspyramid planned and created this miracle—so we are told. But something is notquite right here.image [../images/f0138-01.jpg]113image [../images/f0138-02.jpg]114image [../images/f0139-01.jpg]115image [../images/f0139-02.jpg]116image [../images/f0140-01.jpg]117image [../images/f0140-02.jpg]118image [../images/f0141-01.jpg]119Cheops’ father was called Sneferu and was presumably older than his son. ThisPharaoh Sneferu (2575–2551 BC) had a pyramid built in Dahshur, among otherthings. From the outside, it looks like a pile of boulders—as if the structurehad stood in the water for decades. (Image 114) What is inside this mountain ofrubble? A “Grand Gallery,” with granite blocks arranged on top of one another,like that of his son Cheops. Here there is not enough space for a razor bladebetween the stone beams either. Every cut is perfectly. (Images 115–116) Forheaven’s sake—Sneferu preceded Cheops straight out of the Stone Age. But hisbuilders displayed a “Grand Gallery” before Cheops. From what magic workshop didthe knowledge, the planning, the technology used by the Stone Age person Sneferucome? Where, pray tell, is the developmental history of the technology when thefather of Cheops was already practicing what his son’s architects were allegedlythe first to develop?Anyone who, dripping with sweat, today climbs into the Great Pyramid firstenters a passageway reminiscent of a Swiss mineshaft. The hole was made in theyear AD 827. At the time, the Caliph Abdullah Al-Mamun wanted to get at thetreasures which he assumed to be inside the pyramid. His raiding party did notfind any entrance, so the men laboriously chiseled a shaft through the blocks ofthe pyramid. (Images 117–118) After 10 meters, the air became thin, stifling,and poisonous, because the torches used up what little oxygen there was.Unnerved, the troop wanted to give up, when suddenly they stood rooted to thespot. For a dull rolling sound and then a loud bang could be heard inside. Somestone must have dislodged and rumbled down. So the men tenaciously continuedwith their chiselling and finally came upon a passageway. That led to the actualentrance 16.5 meters above the ground or 10 layers of stone higher than the holemade by Al-Mamun. (Image 119) In the opposite direction, the shaft led to acorridor which is described as an “ascending passageway.” Boards with chickenladders were put on the ground for the tourists, and railings were fixed to thewalls. (Images 120–122) Anyone who wants to go up the passageway must crouch,because the 23-meter-long section is only about 1 meter high. Then thetourist—panting and dripping with sweat—enters the Grand Gallery. And that iswhen the next justified questions present themselves.image [../images/f0142-01.jpg]120image [../images/f0142-02.jpg]121image [../images/f0143-01.jpg]122image [../images/f0144-01.jpg]123The ascending passageway that leads to the Grand Gallery is so small and lowthat not even the sarcophagus which stands in the King’s Chamber would fitthrough it. (Image 123) The experts say that we have to imagine the GrandGallery as a long, ascending hall in which stately processions proceeded to paytheir last respects to the pharaoh. Yet the same procession of priests wouldfirst have had to crawl through the ascending passageway to reach the GrandGallery at all. That does not make sense. Why this low ascending passageway?At the upper end of the Grand Gallery we have the entrance to the King’sChamber. Three-tonne stone trapdoors once blocked the entrance. The King’sChamber feels like a cathedral. The rectangular space measures 5.22 meters in anorth-south direction and 10.47 meters from east to west. The height is 5.82meters. It is hard to understand why, with such dimensions, it is called achamber. The walls consist of five granite beams laid one on top of theother—not set next to one another! The floor has also been lined with graniteslabs. The walls feel like smooth marble. The ceiling of pink Aswan graniteconsists of nine huge beams and has been assembled with such precision that thejoints are visible, at best, as thin black threads. And above this ceiling wehave the next piece of nonsense: the relief chambers.These are five hollow spaces stacked on top of one another above the King’sChamber. The pharaoh’s engineers allegedly planned these five hollow spaces asrelief chambers, the scientific consensus says. (Image 124) As long as 60 yearsago, the Egyptologist Dr. Hermann Kees pointed out, “...the relief chambers overthe coffin chamber of the Cheops pyramid, which by the way serve no purpose interms of statics, are very original”12 [ch05_note.html#ch04note12a] (emphasis byErich von Däniken). Who, then, had the unfortunate idea of calling these hollowspaces “relief chambers,” and why do hordes of scribblers and archaeologistsquote this rubbish? The relief chambers do not even lie on the axis of thepyramid (that is, under its point), and they relieve nothing whatsoever.Furthermore, intentionally planned relief chambers assume that the Cheopsengineers of 5,000 years ago had calculated the total weight of the pyramid. Howcan that be reconciled with the knowledge of the time? Such calculations haveonly become possible today as a result of computers. Would the King’s Chamberhave collapsed without relief chambers? Would the pyramid have caved in?Nonsense. The space above the ceiling could simply have been supported withgranite beams whose weight did not rest on the ceiling of the King’s Chamber.Moreover, where are the other relief chambers in the pyramid? The reliefchambers spontaneously remind me of a Shinto temple—a gate to another world.image [../images/f0146-01.jpg]124The experts provide evidence of the fact that Cheops from the Fourth Dynastybuilt the pyramid, evidence which, on closer inspection, turns out to be oflittle value, as I intend to show. What do the ancient historians actually haveto say about it, those men who wrote about Egypt, about the construction of thepyramids, some 2,000 years ago?Diodorus of Sicily (first century BC), the author, no less, of a 40-volume workof history, states:The eighth king was Chemmis from Memphis. The latter governed for 50 years andbuilt the largest of the three pyramids which are considered to belong to theseven Wonders of the World.... It consists completely of hard stone, which isvery difficult to work but also lasts eternally.... It is told that the stonewas brought from far away in Arabia.... And the most wondrous thing is, althoughworks of such magnitude were built here, and the surrounding region consists ofnothing but sand, no trace has been left either of an embankment or the cuttingof stones so that the impression is given as if this work had not been createdgradually by human hand but had been placed finished all at once into the sandydesert as if by a god....13 [ch05_note.html#ch04note13a]The greatest mocker among the classical historians, Gaius Plinius Secundus, whomoreover had the advantage of knowing all the works of his predecessors, alsodescribed the Egyptian pyramids:The material for the largest pyramids was supplied by the quarries of Arabiaand...all three (pyramids) were completed in 78 years and four months. Thefollowing authors have described the pyramids: Herodotus, Euhemerus, Duris ofSamos, Aristagoras, Dionysius, Artemidorus, Alexander Polyhistor, Butoridas,Antisthenes, Demetrius, Demoteles, and Apion. But none of them can say whoactually built them....14 [ch05_note.html#ch04note14a]Not bad. Gaius knows 12 works on the pyramids and expressly notes that no oneknows who built them. And that millennia ago.In 1850, a stele was found in the ruins of the Isis temple which today can beseen in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. The inscription says that Cheops hadestablished the house of Isis, the lady of the pyramid, beside the house of theSphinx. If Isis is described as “lady of the pyramid,” then the Great Pyramidwas already standing when Cheops appeared on the scene. Furthermore, the Sphinx(Images 125–126) would also already have existed which, in the opinion of thearchaeologists, is only said to have been built by Chefren, who succeededCheops.In around AD 1360, the Arab historian Al-Maqrizi (1364–1442) collected all theavailable documents about the pyramids. He published that material in the“pyramid chapter” of his work Hitat.15 [ch05_note.html#ch04note15a] In it, welearn that the Great Pyramid was built as long ago as before the Flood by a kingnamed Saurid. Who was this Saurid? The Hitat says about him that “he was Hermes,whom the Arabs call Idris.”16 [ch05_note.html#ch04note16a] God himself hadinstructed him in astronomy and revealed to him that a catastrophe would come topass over the earth, but that a small part of it would remain in which thesciences would be urgently required. Thereupon “Saurid” alias Hermes alias Idrishad built the pyramids. This is explained in greater detail in Chapter 33 of theHitat:image [../images/f0148-01.jpg]125image [../images/f0150-01.jpg]126image [../images/f0151-01.jpg]127The first Hermes, who was called the Thrice-Great in his capacity as prophet,king, and sage. He is the one whom the Hebrews call Enoch, the son of Jared, sonof Mahalalel, son of Kenan, son of Enos, son of Seth, son of Adam—blessings beupon him—and who read in the stars that the Flood would come. So he had thepyramids built and saved in them treasures, learned writings, and everythingabout which he was concerned that it would be lost and could disappear, in orderto protect these things and keep them well.17 [ch05_note.html#ch04note17a]It is not only in the Hitat that Enoch alias Hermes is named as the builder ofthe pyramids. The Arab explorer and writer Ibn Battuta (14th century) alsoaffirmed that Enoch had built the pyramids before the Flood “to keep in thembooks of science and knowledge and other valuable objects.”18[ch05_note.html#ch04note18a]Confusing. But nothing was found in the pyramids. Not so fast! The discoveriesare still to be made.The Hitat counts six generations before Enoch. Al-Maqrizi, the author, clearlyknows what he is talking about, because Enoch is the seventh patriarch beforethe Flood. Enoch means “the initiate, the insightful, the knowledgeable” inHebrew. I have reported about this Enoch in many of my books and will thereforerefrain from any repetition here. (The most detailed report about Enoch can befound in source Falsch Informiert.19 [ch05_note.html#ch04note19a])On the Sumerian King List <WB444>, an engraved stone block which can be admiredin the British Museum, 10 primal kings ruled from the creation of the earth tothe Flood. (Image 127) The seventh on this list from before the Flood is said tohave lived in the sun city of Sippar. The gods themselves had instructed him “inthe art of writing and seeing into the future.”20 [ch05_note.html#ch04note20a]According to Genesis, this is Enoch. The fame of this seventh ruler from beforethe Flood was so great that the Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar I, who lived muchlater in about 1100 BC, traced his lineage back to this pre-Flood king.Cuneiform translations in recent decades have revealed that it is precisely thisseventh ruler who “ascended to the heavens.” Just like Enoch. It also fits inwith his own description of the extraterrestrials, the so-called heavenlyguardians. They teach him their language, dictate scientific books to him andfinally take him with them on their journey into the space. All of it in detailand told personally by Enoch in the first person.21 [ch05_note.html#ch04note21a]image [../images/f0153-01.jpg]128But it was Cheops and not Enoch who built the Great Pyramid, the critics reply.This Cheops does indeed occur in the lists of kings, for example on a templewall in Abydos. There we have the Cheops from the Fourth Dynasty—but not asingle glyph mentions that he is the builder of the Great Pyramid. Why ever not?Because the ancient Egyptians did not know who had the pyramid built. And whatabout the glyph and the name “Cheops” daubed into one of the relief chambers?The chemist and pyramid researcher Alireza Zarei refers in his exceptionallywell-documented book Die verletzte Pyramide (The Damaged Pyramid) to variousways of writing and interpretations of the name “Cheops.” There is little whichis unambiguous and clear. Moreover, so Alireza Zarei writes, “a furtherinscription of the Pharaoh Cheops” had been found “on the fourth layer of stonesof the west wall.”22 [ch05_note.html#ch04note22a] Finally, a 5-centimeter-highimage of a seated Cheops had turned up in the Chontamenti temple in Abydos. Itcan be admired today in the Egyptian Museum. (Image 128) Yet not a whisper hereeither that the seated Cheops had ordered the Great Pyramid to be built. And todot the “i,” the father of history, Herodotus, names Cheops/Khufu as the builderof the pyramid. What more does anyone want? Cheops has been nailed down. Or hashe?image [../images/f0154-01.jpg]129The detective work is not as simple as it looks. To begin with, it must be notedthat none of the historians of antiquity who visited Egypt 2,000 years ago andasked the priests at the time know anything about a Cheops. The exception isHerodotus: he came from Halicarnassus in Asia Minor and became the globetrotterof his age. Egypt, which he entered in July 448 BC, was a new world forHerodotus. Thus he took a note of everything that his interlocutors told himabout the history of their country and meticulously distinguished between whathe was told and what he saw with his own eyes. Herodotus wrote he had been tolda Pharaoh called “Khufu” had had the Great Pyramid built within 20 years.“Khufu” is Egyptian—in Greek he is called “Cheops,” hence the name Cheops. Inthis case, Egyptologists ignored all other historians who knew nothing about aCheops and threw themselves on Herodotus’ statement. The following example showsthe selective way in which they proceeded.image [../images/f0155-01.jpg]130image [../images/f0155-02.jpg]131image [../images/f0156-01.jpg]132Herodotus reports that a pharaoh called Menes had ordered the Nile to bediverted above Memphis. The Egyptologists like this statement. Eighteen lineslater, the same Herodotus writes, “Menes was followed by 330 kings whose namesthe priests read out from a book.” The diversion of the Nile fit, the 330 kingsdid not. Or, in the second book of his Histories, Herodotus writes that thepriests in Thebes had personally shown him 341 statues and all these statuestogether represented 11,340 years. At that time, the gods had still lived amonghumans. Since then, they had no longer come. Herodotus gives the expressassurance: “The Egyptians are absolutely sure of that, because they havecontinuously counted and written down the years.”23 [ch05_note.html#ch04note23a]For Egyptology, the 333 kings or 11,340 years are absolute nonsense, even if allthe other historians of antiquity provide equally “impossible” numbers ofyears—numbers which, without exception, go beyond 10,000 BC.image [../images/f0157-01.jpg]133Cheops is said to have been a tyrant. Vanity lies in the nature of every tyrant.Yet the Great Pyramid of the Pharaoh Cheops is totally anonymous. How can atyrant have the mightiest structure on earth built without boasting about it,without immortalizing his name with just a single tiny glyph? The total absenceof any inscription is nothing but perverse; the anonymity of the structure doesnot fit with the character of the principal.Pliny wrote, “...so the creators of this vanity have rightly fallen victim tothe past.”24 [ch05_note.html#ch04note24a] Vanity and namelessness areincompatible. If the Pharaoh Cheops was vain, indeed, a tyrant and oppressor(Herodotus), then his heroic deeds should be heralded on every wall. Theobjection has been raised that his oppressed people chiselled away thehieroglyphs praising the deeds of their dictator. When? The pyramid wascompletely sealed. No raving madman could enter it to give vent to his fury onthe inscriptions of the pharaoh. Modern academic opinion, moreover, holds thatno slaves were employed in ancient Egypt.25 [ch05_note.html#ch04note25a] Thefirst person to break open the pyramid after millennia was the Caliph Al-Mamun.What did he actually find?image [../images/f0158-01.jpg]134Al-Mamun opened the Great Pyramid. I visited its interior and saw a largevaulted chamber whose base formed a square while it was round above. In themiddle there was a square well shaft with the depth of ten cubits. If one climbsdown into it, one discovers on each of its four sides a gateway leading to alarge room in which corpses lie: the sons of Adam....26[ch05_note.html#ch04note26a]In the Hitat, we can also read that Al-Mamun found several corpses with strangearmour inside the pyramid, as well as books in an unfamiliar writing. Excuse me?Al-Mamun and his scholars would undoubtedly have been able to read hieroglyphsfrom the time of Cheops.In about 300 BC, a priest and historian called Manetho lived in Egypt. Eightworks are attributed to him, including a book on the history of Egypt. Manetho’sbooks have been lost, but the historian Julius Africanus (died c. 240 BC) andthe Church Father Eusebius (died AD 339) recorded information from Manetho.27[ch05_note.html#ch04note27a], 28 [ch05_note.html#ch04note28a] He reports thatthe first ruler of Egypt was Hephaestus, who had also brought fire. He wasfollowed by Chronos; Osiris; Typhon, brother of Osiris; then Horus, son ofOsiris and Isis. “After the gods, the demigods reigned for 1,255 years. Andagain other kings ruled for 1,817 years. Then another thirty kings of Memphis,1,790 years. And then ten kings of Thinis for 350 years. The reign of thedemigods comprised 5,813 years...”29 [ch05_note.html#ch04note29a]The Church Father Eusebius attempted to interpret Manetho’s numbers—and all ofthem, not just the ones listed here—as lunar years. But the lunar yearscalculated backwards in earth years still produced a figure beyond 14,000 BC.Things become even more confusing: according to the Sumerian King List <WB444>,the 10 primal kings ruled from the creation of the earth to the Flood, a totalof 456,000 years. After the Flood, the “kingship descended from heaven again.”The 23 kings after the Flood together still managed a reign of 24,510 years, 3months, and 3.5 days. A comparison of the Sumerian and Babylonian figures withfigures from distant India reveal something highly puzzling: Buddhism works withyugas (epochs). The number 4,320,000 of the Maha Yuga (Great Epoch) is identicalwith the one of the third pre-Flood primal king En-men-lu-ana. He ruled 12“sars,” which is 43,200 years. Or the number 288,000 of the Deva Yugacorresponds to the number of the sixth primal king with the magnificent nameEn-sipad-zid-ana. He managed a good 8 sars, which is 28,800 years. In Greece, wefind the oldest literary reference to a world age in the poet Heraclitus. Hespecifies the number 10,800,000 years. The same basic value corresponds to thesecond period of the Sumerian primal kings, namely 30 sars or 108,000 years.Here, the important thing is not the zeros but the numbers.This numbers game has absolutely nothing to do with the Cheops of the FourthDynasty and yet it illustrates something which is common to everything. In timeimmemorial, there must have been an original teach-ing—the numbers cannot beexplained in any other way. These mysterious origins must, of necessity, lievery far in the past. The history books would know about it otherwise.The scribbles of the word “Cheops” in the Great Pyramid do not prove that hebuilt it. (Image 129) Although it is said that Al-Mamun was the first to havebroken into the pyramid after Cheops, tomb robbers have always tunneled into thestructure. Assuming for a moment that the pyramid already stood at the time ofCheops, it cannot be excluded that someone broke into it then and daubed allkinds of things on the walls and ceiling of the relief chambers with red paint.Perhaps also the word Cheops, with the red paint then dripping through thecracks. It is also conceivable that there were several “Cheopses” in the longcourse of Egyptian history. After all, there were also several Ramses andseveral Amenemhets. We need only think of the 333 kings mentioned by Herodotusor the list of Manetho. It is also conceivable that the tyrant Cheops from theFourth Dynasty appropriated the building. In the controversy about who wasresponsible for building the pyramid, I would like to put forward anotherthought which argues against the Cheops from the Fourth Dynasty—an argumentwhich it has only become possible to advance because of the most recentdiscoveries in the pyramid.image [../images/f0160-01.jpg]135image [../images/f0162-01.jpg]136Anyone who pokes around on the pyramid plateau will notice layers of stone withvarious deposits on them. It is hard to avoid the impression that water musthave stood here at some point. That relates to walls and rock sections whichtourists never get to see, but also the ramps. It is particularly visible in theValley of the Crows below the pyramids, but also on the section up to thepyramid of Chefren. Water rings are also visible on the so-called fourthpyramid, which is not accessible for tourists. (Images 130–147) Now this landpositively did not lie under water in the Fourth Dynasty—otherwise Cheops wouldnot have been able to plant his building there at all. (Always assuming he didso.) “Land submerged” would, however, fit very well with Enoch; after all, helived before the Flood. Irritatingly, the pyramid of Cheops’ father, Sneferu,looks like a pile of rubble from the outside. The stones have been worn away bywind and sand over thousands of years, the experts assure us. But the wind blowsmore strongly from some directions than from others. The traces of the erosionshould vary, depending on where on the pyramid it occurred. But they don’t.(Image 148)image [../images/f0163-01.jpg]137image [../images/f0164-01.jpg]138image [../images/f0164-02.jpg]139image [../images/f0165-01.jpg]140image [../images/f0165-02.jpg]141image [../images/f0166-01.jpg]142image [../images/f0166-02.jpg]143image [../images/f0167-01.jpg]144image [../images/f0167-02.jpg]145image [../images/f0168-01.jpg]146image [../images/f0168-02.jpg]147image [../images/f0169-01.jpg]148image [../images/f0169-02.jpg]149image [../images/f0170-01.jpg]150image [../images/f0170-02.jpg]151If the Cheops pyramid had been built before the Flood, it would have beensubmerged just like the (alleged) Sneferu pyramid. Where are the watermarks withCheops? Salt crystals, for which there is no explanation, were found in someplaces inside the pyramid—for example, the ceiling of the “uppermost reliefchamber is covered in incredibly large salt crystals.”30[ch05_note.html#ch04note30a] The diligent Alireza Zarei has provided thephotographic evidence. (Image 149) But if the Cheops pyramid had ever stood inwater, should the traces of erosion not be visible just as much on the outsideas with Sneferu’s pyramid?Consider this: Originally the Great Pyramid was covered with slabs. They wereonly broken off after Al-Mamun. These pyramid slabs—nicely cut to size—were usedfor parts of Cairo’s city walls, mosques, and government buildings.In the summer of 1986, the two French architects Jean-Patrice Dormion and GillesGoidin discovered hollow spaces in the Cheops pyramid with their electronicdetectors. With the assistance of the Ministry of State of Antiquities,microprobes were driven through stones 2.5 meters thick. Under the Queen’sChamber (Images 150–151), the Frenchmen came upon a 3-meter-wide and5.5-meter-high cavity filled with crystalline sand. What was the originalpurpose of this passageway?Alerted by the success of the Frenchmen, the Japanese from Waseda University inTokyo were not to be outdone. On January 22, 1987, a top team began its researchinto the Great Pyramid. Electronic measurements located various spaces andchambers inside the pyramid. The scientific report from Waseda University evenrefers to “a whole labyrinth” of passageways.31 [ch05_note.html#ch04note31a]In 1992, the geologist Dr. Robert M. Schoch from the College of General Studiesof Boston University carried out geological measurements on the Sphinx togetherwith Dr. Thomas L. Dobecki and other scientists. The result: the Sphinx is atleast 5,000 years older than previously assumed.32 [ch05_note.html#ch04note32a]On March 22, 1993, at precisely 11:05 in the morning, the German engineer RudolfGantenbrink, with his robot “Upuaut,” discovered a small door with two metalfittings inside the Great Pyramid. The discovery was made after a trip of about60 meters, starting from the Queen’s Chamber in an ascending direction insidethe edifice. Gantenbrink’s robot was a 6-kilogram tracked vehicle only 37centimeters in length. This technical miracle was driven by seven independentelectric motors. Two small halogen spotlights and a swivelling and tilting SonyCCD mini video camera were attached to the front. (Images 152–153) The attemptwas made at the time to deny Rudolf Gantenbrink’s sensational discovery. Peoplewaffled about “soul shafts,”33 [ch05_note.html#ch04note33a] “completerubbish,”34 [ch05_note.html#ch04note34a] and even a “delusion.”35[ch05_note.html#ch04note35a] After its 60-meter trip, Rudolf Gantenbrink’s robothad come to a halt in front of a small door. What lay behind that door? (Image154)image [../images/f0172-01.jpg]152image [../images/f0173-01.jpg]153A new robot, this one built by the National Geographic Society in the UnitedStates, drilled a hole through the little door. A camera was pushed through. Itrevealed another blocking stone, or little door, 20 centimeters further on.Another robot, which the designers named “Djedi,” with different abilities wasrequired. A long arm was to reach through the hole created by NationalGeographic and drill through the “blocking stone” behind. On May 29, 2011Spiegel Online reported: “A research robot has again driven into the mysteriousshaft below the King’s Chamber in the Cheops pyramid—but this time equipped witha swiveling camera.”36 [ch05_note.html#ch04note36a] (Image 155)image [../images/f0174-01.jpg]154image [../images/f0174-02.jpg]155image [../images/f0175-01.jpg]156image [../images/f0176-01.jpg]157The magazine Mysteries, edited by the brilliant Swiss journalist Luc Bürgin,showed the pictures taken by the Djedi robot behind the blocking stone.37[ch05_note.html#ch04note37a] A new chamber with smoothly polished stones wasvisible. Illegible red markings, two handles clearly made of metal and aperfectly round hole could be seen on a side wall. (Images 156-157) And thatmakes it increasingly hard to relate the pyramid to the Cheops from the FourthDynasty. The planning of all the spaces, passageways, and chambers can no longerbe reconciled with the brains of the people from the Iron and Bronze Age. So farwe know about the following hollow spaces within the Cheops pyramid:• The entrance, 16.5 meters above the ground with the descending passageway.• The intersection of the descending passageway and ascending passageway and theshaft into the depths to the “unfinished tomb.”• The 119-meter-long shaft in the rock under the pyramid to the “unfinishedtomb.”• The “unfinished tomb” at a depth of 35 meters under the pyramid, 14.02 meterslong and 8.25 meters wide.• The 3.5 meter vertical shaft from the “unfinished tomb” even deeper into therock.• The 23-meter-long ascending passageway.• The 47-meter-long and 8.5-meter-high Grand Gallery.• The five so-called relief chambers.• The 38.15-meter-long horizontal passage to the inner King’s Chamber.• The 5.76-meter-long, 5.23-meter-wide, and 6.26-meter-high King’s Chamber.• The 6.85-meter-long passage to the King’s Chamber.• The 5.22-meter-wide, 10.47-meter-long, and 5.82-meter-high King’s Chamber.• The sand-filled hollow spaces under the horizontal passage to the inner King’sChamber (Dormion and Gilles).• The 60-meter-long Gantenbrink shaft running upward at an angle from the King’sChamber.• Its unexplored counterpart running upwards at the same angle from the northside of the King’s Chamber.• The newly discovered space behind the Gantenbrink shaft (Djedi).• The shafts electronically located by the team from Waseda University, Tokyo.If we do a rough calculation just of the length of the known shafts and spaces,and add the labyrinth of shafts and passageways located by the troupe fromWaseda University, Tokyo, there should be about 1 kilometer of hollow spacewithin the Great Pyramid. (Image 158) That does not take into account the volume(height, depth, and width) of the spaces. Impossible for the gents from theBronze and Iron Age!The Chefren pyramid is always excluded from this game. (Image 159) All theresearchers throw themselves on Cheops, but Chefren also offers inexplicablephenomena. In the years 1968 and 1969 the Nobel Prize winner for physics, Dr.Louis Alvarez, undertook a radiation experiment in the Chefren pyramid. Alvarezand his team started from the known fact in physics that cosmic radiationbombards the earth around the clock. This radiation loses a fraction of itsenergy as it penetrates solid matter. Precise measurements can determine howmany protons are not slowed down as much because they have passed through ahollow space. Using a spark chamber and an IBM computer, Alvarez measured thetracks of more than 2.5 million particles. Yet the oscillographs showed achaotic pattern, just as if particles were arcing around a corner. The veryexpensive experiment, in which various American institutes, IBM, and Cairo’s AinShams University participated, ended without a result. Dr. Amr Gohed, the headof archaeological research at the time, told journalists the findings were“scientifically impossible” and added that either “the structure of the pyramidis chaotic or there is a mystery which we cannot explain.”38[ch05_note.html#ch04note38a]image [../images/f0178-01.jpg]158Translation of termsEntlastungskammer—Discharge chamberBelüftungsschacht—Air shaftKönigskammer—King’s chamberKöniginnenkammer—Queen’s chamberGantenbrinkschaft—Gantenbrink shaftHorizontaler Durchgang—Horizontal passageDie Grotte—The grottoSchacht der Diebe—Thief’s shaftUnvollendete Grabkammer—Unfinished chamberGrosse Gallerie—Grand galleryAufwährtsführender Gang—Ascending passageway passagewayAbsteigender Gang—Descending passagewayVerschluss Blöcke—Closing blocksHeutiger Eingang (gewaltsam aufgebrochen)—Today’s entry (broken up violently)image [../images/f0179-01.jpg]159Thus the curiosities are restricted not just to the Cheops pyramid; the Chefrenpyramid also contains unsolved riddles. The chambers and passageways in theChefren represent only a fraction of its interior life. (Images 160-162)Back to the Cheops pyramid. It was not just a matter of piling one layer ofstone on top of another and leaving a little gap here and there. Every singleshaft, every passageway—just think of the 38-meter-long passage to the King’schamber or the 47-meter-long Grand Gallery—was part of an exact plan whichexisted from the start of construction. (Image 163) The shaft under the pyramid,which leads to the unfinished tomb, alone is 119 meters long sloping downwardthrough the rock at an angle (1.20 meters high and 1.06 meters wide, with anangle of inclination of 26° 31’ 23”). How, actually, was this shaft made? (Image164) By digging, chiselling away, of course. The first worker of the column musthave pushed the lumps of rock, laboriously quarried with soft copper or ironchisels, behind him like a mole so that his fellow workers could transport therubble outside. Only a single man could have worked in the shaft with its heightof 1.20 meters and width of 1.06 meters. There was no room beside or above him.The deeper the shaft descended, the darker it became. So torches, wax, oil lampswere required and with them went the last bit of oxygen. At some point the humanvoles reached the spot at which the subterranean chamber was to be created. Soonward as before—with chisels and hammers. Light and air were probablysuperfluous in the depths. Perhaps the teams were working in the dark with radarand Albino eyes and were not bothered by the chunks of rock which thumped one orthe other of them on the head every so often, squashed fingers or trapped feet.(Images 165–168) The spoil was carted to the surface on sledges, and presumablyair was pumped into the caves full of stone dust with hoses made from animalintestines. Once the underground hall had been halfway excavated, the happyworkers must have created the 15-meter-long, dead-end passage in the southwestcorner just for the fun of it, which they then proceeded to line with polishedblocks. As a parting gift, they dug a 3.5-meter-long hole in the ground, leftthe half-finished space behind, and began to line parts of the previouslylaboriously dug shaft with finely polished, massive blocks from Tura. More than100 meters without the slightest deviation in inclination in a straight lineupward. Hard to think that this subterranean work was carried out when thepyramid had already been built. Why not? Because the entrance to the119-meter-long diagonal shaft starts in the pyramid. A contradiction? No. If thepyramid had already been standing when the excavations began, all the dirt wouldhave had to be transported from the 119-meter-long shaft and the unfinishedchamber (Images 169–170) into the pyramid. It would have had to be taken to thepoint where the ascending and descending passageways intersected and from thereonwards to the actual entrance of the pyramid 16.5 meters above the ground.Hence I assume that the 119-meter-long passage and the “unfinished tomb” wereexcavated first and only then were the first layers of the pyramid laid down.Although even at this point, the structure would already have had to have beenplanned exactly because the 119-meter shaft leads precisely into the pyramid.image [../images/f0180-01.jpg]160image [../images/f0181-01.jpg]161image [../images/f0182-01.jpg]162image [../images/f0183-01.jpg]163I hear that the foreman changed during construction, or the pharaoh altered theplans on short notice. Excuse me? For as long as stones had to be quarried outof the rock down in the “unfinished tomb” and brought to the surface, the119-meter shaft could not be lined with polished blocks from Tura. Even thefirst 10 meters of such a lining would have prevented the spoil from beingtransported away from the cavern lying beneath. There would have been no space—Idid, after all, crawl down there—and the transport of the stones would havescratched the squeaky clean walls. Nothing like that can be seen, just as thereare no wheel tracks or drag marks.image [../images/f0184-01.jpg]164image [../images/f0185-01.jpg]165image [../images/f0185-02.jpg]166image [../images/f0186-01.jpg]167And what was it all for? For a space 35 meters vertically below the pyramidwhich no one needed.Every shaft, be it ever so small, every ceiling of pink granite from Aswan,every passageway to a chamber, every upright or horizontal monolith of differenta size was a part of a plan which was finished and completed before the pyramidwas built. Changes during construction were not possible. The 60-meter-longGantenbrink shaft could not be added afterward. Just think of the little door atthe end of the shaft that finally led to a chamber. I also read some foolsuggesting that the Gantenbrink shaft had been chiselled out of the pyramidblocks after the building was already long completed. That makes someone like mecrazy! The Gantenbrink shaft has a side length of precisely 14 centimeters. Noteven a Lilliputian team would fit in there after the event.This shaft ends in a chamber which was discovered by the Djedi robot. So it wasplanned in advance. Furthermore, the builders seem to have known that only ahigh-tech society would be able to reach this chamber—thanks to robots. Anyprevious society would have had to dismantle the whole pyramid from top tobottom in order to reach the “Djedi chamber.”image [../images/f0187-01.jpg]168The planning of the Great Pyramid—I deliberately exclude the Chefren pyramid—thecalculations, drawings, the knowledge about material thickness, the engineeringwork as a whole, does not fit in any way into the society of the Fourth Dynasty.Sneferu, the father of Cheops, came straight out of the Stone Age. The Cheopsgeneration could only just about master iron and copper. To suggest that theyhad precisely planned the pyramid with its chambers, passageways, shafts, anddifferent types and sizes of stone before building began makes about as muchsense as a hippopotamus on the moon. The monoliths used inside the pyramid areof different lengths and widths, have different qualities and colors, dependingon where they were used. The pink granite in the King’s Chamber comes fromAswan, almost 1,000 miles away from the building site. Did they send sprintersto Aswan when a monolith crumbled and had to be replaced? And—please note—workwas going on in the Fourth Dynasty at several building sites simultaneously.Monoliths were polished, quarried from the rock, transported on rafts and bycable haulage, and inserted in the right spot. This Fourth Dynasty may have doneall kinds of things—but planning a pyramid with its complex inner life wasbeyond their capacities. This definitely does not fit into the evolution oftechnology as it applied to Mr. Cheops’ Fourth Dynasty. And such a statement canonly be made today, now that we know about some of the confusing advancedtechnology inside the pyramid.image [../images/f0188-01.jpg]169Every structure before Cheops should be even more primitive from a technical andplanning perspective—so says evolution. Does that rule out any builder beforeCheops?Saurid (alias Enoch) is said to have built this miracle of construction beforethe Flood, ancient Arab historians claim. Why? To protect the all the knowledgeof humankind from the Flood. The Hitat puts it like this:Thereupon he [the builder] had 30 vaults built in the western pyramid made ofcolored granite. They were filled with devices and ornamented columns made ofprecious gems, with equipment made of excellent iron such as weapons which didnot rust, with glass which can be folded without breaking, with strangetalismans.... In the eastern pyramid he had the different celestial vaults andplanets represented and pictures made of what his ancestors had created; inaddition there was incense which was offered up to the stars and books aboutthem. Also to be found there are the fixed stars and what arises in theirperiods from time to time.... Neither was there any science which he did nothave written down and recorded. He further had transported there the treasuresof the stars as well as the treasures of the prophets, and they formed a mightyand uncountable quantity....39 [ch05_note.html#ch04note39a]For decades, Enoch was the personal pupil of those types he called “heavenlyguardians.” To him they were not gods. He learnt their language and served asinterpreter. He was taught writing, and the “heavenly guardians” dictatedcountless books to Enoch—scientific works about astronomy, geology, metallurgy,and so on. Enoch even revealed the names of his teachers. We know what those ETswere called and who was responsible for what area of studies. (Detailedinformation can be found in Falsch Informiert.40 [ch05_note.html#ch04note40a])Then the “heavenly guardians” informed Enoch that they would take him with themon their further journey “into heaven” (space) and that he should take leave ofhis family. Enoch followed the advice and told his son Methuselah: “And now myson Methuselah.... I have told you everything and given you the books whichconcern all these things. Take good care of these books from your father’s hand,my son Methuselah, and give them to future generations after the Flood...”41[ch05_note.html#ch04note41a] (Emphasis by Erich von Däniken)These few sentences clarify a number of things. Methuselah was Enoch’s son (“andnow my son Methuselah...from your father’s hand...”) Enoch speaks in the firstperson (“I have told you everything...”). The event takes place before the Flood(“give them to future generations after the Flood...”). We know for certain thatMethuselah is the son of Enoch from the so-called Lamech Scroll (one of the DeadSea Scrolls).42 [ch05_note.html#ch04note42a] Enoch gave his son more than 300books. Where are they, actually? There is nothing apart from the Ethiopic andSlavonic Book of Enoch and a number of fragments.The Hitat records that God personally had instructed Saurid (alias Hermes, aliasEnoch) in astronomy and had told him that a catastrophe would strike the earth.That fits Enoch to a T. He was meant to build the pyramid “to keep in it booksof science and knowledge and other valuable objects.”43[ch05_note.html#ch04note43a] And Al-Mamun, who was the first to break into thepyramid, is said to have found books in an unknown writing in it, among otherthings. Were the Arab historians chasing shadows thousands of years ago?image [../images/f0190-01.jpg]170image [../images/f0192-01.jpg]171Herodotus reports in the second book of his Histories that there was a lake withglassy water under the pyramid which had a sarcophagus in it. A phantom? Afigment of someone’s imagination? The lake has meanwhile been discovered. Plusthe sarcophagus. Images 171–174 prove it. No figment of the imagination. Thereports of the ancient scribes were based on the best sources of information.Are the original books of Enoch lying somewhere in the labyrinth of the allegedCheops pyramid? Was it that the people did the dirty work of construction, gavetheir sweat, blood, and lives—but the planning was done by Enoch’s teachers?They in turn knew about the coming Flood. After all, they not only informed theBiblical Noah but also in detail their pupil Enoch and their favoriteUtnapishtim in the Gilgamesch epic.44 [ch05_note.html#ch04note44a] In this lineof thought, Enoch’s “heavenly guardians” would have deliberately created abuilding to survive the Flood and the following millennia. A building, moreover,that would always catch the eye of all terrestrial generations—a wonder of theworld that would cause human beings to be amazed and enchanted, and lead them toinvestigate it further, a pyramid filled with geological, mathematical, andastronomical references. (There is a wealth of outstanding literature on thesesubjects. For mathematicians, for example, the book Henochs Uhr (Enoch’s Clock)by Paul Krannich.45 [ch05_note.html#ch04note45a]) A building with such asophisticated inner life that it would require a high-tech society to discoverthe hidden spaces. A chronological treasure that would transport the informationarising from Enoch’s experiences and his contact with the ETs safely into thefuture. A future, by the way, in which the “gods” intended to return. Will wefind not just books and technologies in the Great Pyramid but also theinterstellar home addresses of those extraterrestrials who instructed the humanbeing Enoch thousands of years ago?image [../images/f0193-01.jpg]172image [../images/f0194-01.jpg]173I am clearly not the only person to pose such questions. For quite a while,measurements have been undertaken in the Great Pyramid using the most moderntechnology. There has even been crude drilling using pneumatic drills withoutthe public being told a word about it. The untiring Alireza Zarei reports:When I visited the Giza plateau in 2009, I was able...to visit the reliefchambers on several occasions. I reached the entrance to the relief chambersafter climbing a temporary 8-meter ladder. I crawled straight towards thesouthwest corner to verify for myself a new, illegally dug tunnel. And it wasindeed so! The original passage had been extended by some meters and turnedsharply to the right at the end. There the passage continued in a straight linefor another few meters where it ended in a barely 1.5 meter deep hollow. The useof modern tools could clearly be seen on the walls as the drag marks there werequite different from those in the Caviglias tunnel and the others in thepyramid.46 [ch05_note.html#ch04note46a]Alireza Zarei’s Images 175–177 prove what he saw.No one drills in the Great Pyramid, and even less so with heavy equipment,without the knowledge of the authorities. The inspired structure is guardedaround the clock. Someone must logically have come to an agreement with theMinistry of State of Antiquities. No heavy drills get into the Great Pyramidwithout explicit agreement. Which secret service might be involved? Who on ourplanet is so influential that even the duty of care of the archaeologists isgrossly ignored? After all, the drills used could destroy valuable treasures.What is actually being sought? Just consider the huge effort in total secrecy.And my questions are not about conspiracy theories. Because if the drilling hadbeen carried out officially, the public and our noble archaeologists could havebeen informed. Period!Every tourist who gasps their way up the Grand Gallery inside the pyramid inamazement will notice metal brackets between the monoliths. What were theyoriginally for? This miracle of construction today presents itself in totalanonymity. Nothing, not a tiny little glyph, adorns this phenomenal complex.Why, then, the brackets?Image 178 is the creation of my imagination. It shows the walls of the GrandGallery as they might have looked millennia ago. Then someone came along andripped the messages from the “heavenly guardians” (Enoch) off the walls. Humanbeings were not to venerate foreign gods, were not to find out who the originalteachers of our young humanity were. Such knowledge would destroy thefoundations of the great religions, be it Judaism, Christianity, or Islam. Thosein the know in all religions are agreed on that. And because nationalpoliticians have close connections with the respective religions, themystery-mongers, the pseudo responsibly minded in world politics are also toldabout it. Peoples of the world, unite in ignorance!image [../images/f0196-01.jpg]174image [../images/f0198-01.jpg]175image [../images/f0198-02.jpg]176image [../images/f0199-01.jpg]177image [../images/f0200-01.jpg]178"},{"pageContent":"NOTESIMPOSSIBLE BUILDINGS1 [ch02.html#ch02note1].
