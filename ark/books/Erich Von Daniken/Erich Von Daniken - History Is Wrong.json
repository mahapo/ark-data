I started with my wife, the apple ofmy eye, and continued at the office. I asked everyone the same question. Then Icalled some of my relatives and later—feeling a little pluckier—even completestrangers in a restaurant. “Excuse me. Could I ask you a question?” I waspolite—as one is—even though a lot of the guests simply wrinkled their brows inpuzzlement, seemingly asking themselves, What the hell does this guy want? Butin the end I had asked a hundred people, and that was enough.“Have you ever heard of the Voynich manuscript?”“The w-h-a-t?”Out of one hundred people, only one had ever heard of the Voynich manuscript,and even then knew nothing of any consequence. Voynich manuscript? Wasn’t theresomething about that in P.M. magazine in Germany?1 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not1]Voynich? Some sort of secret code from the Second World War? A secretorganization? Voynich? Voynich? Yet there are countless pages about the Voynichmanuscript on the Internet, for instance at www.voynich.nu[http://www.voynich.nu], a site that also features countless links to othersources. Hundreds of treatises have been written about the Voynich manuscript byboth scientists and laymen alike, including books—one of the best by the BritonsKennedy and Churchill: The Voynich Manuscript.2 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not2] Itcontains the entire history of this puzzling and crazy document, including muchof the speculation and attempts at deciphering the text.To be honest, just about everything that could be written about the Voynichmanuscript has already been written, so it makes no sense to repeat it here.Nevertheless, there are still a few blank spots on the world map of Voynichscholarship—interconnections that I have never encountered in any of theliterature about the Voynich manuscript. Our way of thinking—so we believe—ischaracterized by logic and information. In reality, we are just like the versesof an enormous book, from which we don’t even know the first 4,000 pages. We’reliving on a single page. And in terms of the entire composition, we know neitherthe vocabulary nor even the alphabet. Today’s reason cannot accept the reason ofthe past. And in so saying, I turn to the people who have remained intelligent,even while being a part of academia. My readers shouldn’t end up like thehundred people I had questioned earlier. So, for that reason, I’d like to tellyou a little about the incredible Voynich manuscript.THE MAN BEHIND THE MANUSCRIPTOn October 31, 1865, in the city of Telšia in Lithuania, the Wojnicz family wasblessed by the arrival of a son. Records show that they christened him Michal,but he changed this in later life to Wilfryd. His father held a position in agovernment office and sent him first to school and then to university in Moscow,where he studied chemistry and qualified as a pharmacist. He became politicallyactive, becoming involved with the Polish nationalist movement, which wasfighting to liberate Poland from the Russians. He joined a group of youngactivists who were attempting to save two of their comrades from execution. Thisled to his arrest in 1885 and incarceration in solitary confinement in a Warsawprison. In the summer of 1887, Wilfryd was to be transported to a prison camp inSiberia, but somehow he escaped and went on the run. He made his way—no onequite knows how—to London, where he resurfaced three years later.Living in the London suburb of Chiswick, he met up with a group of fanaticalEnglishmen and exiled Russians bent on ending the rule of the czar. Theypublished a revolutionary magazine called Free Russia, which Wilfrid Voynich(having anglicized his name) sold on the streets. With the help of hisgirlfriend, Ethel Boole, he worked his way up to becoming manager of a smallbookshop. In September 1902, the two married—not purely for love, partially forconvenience, as Wilfrid wanted to take on British nationality and he could onlydo this by marrying a British citizen.Wilfrid Voynich led an exciting life with many ups and downs—and he waspermanently short of money. Mr. and Mrs. Voynich began smuggling banned books toRussia, and Wilfrid lived in constant fear of becoming the victim of a politicalattack. So he traveled under a series of aliases—depending on which country hewas in and what company he was keeping. Back in London, Voynich opened anantiquarian bookshop and began buying up old manuscripts and books. The shop wassoon a chaotic treasure trove of exotic parchments and printed material fromthroughout the centuries. Of the discovery of the “most mysterious book in theworld,” Voynich claimed he had discovered it in an old castle in southernEurope.3 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not3] The richly colored manuscript had lain hiddenin an old chest and nobody had known of its existence. The entire work iswritten down on parchment and illustrated with countless color drawings, and hehad immediately suspected that it was produced sometime in the second half ofthe 13th century.Since that time, the unreadable work has been known as the Voynich manuscript.WHAT HAPPENED NEXTA while after Voynich’s death (on March 19, 1931) it became known that his claimto have found the manuscript in an “old castle” was a fabrication. Wilfrid leftbehind a will in which he left the manuscript to his wife, Ethel, and hissecretary, Anne Nill. After Ethel’s death Anne Nill became the sole owner of theVoynich manuscript, and she confessed in a letter that was not to be publisheduntil after her death, that Wilfrid had found the manuscript in 1912 in a formerJesuit collegio, in the Villa Mandragone. This villa had been a Jesuit trainingcenter and had housed an impressive collection of old manuscripts from thelibrary of the Collegium Romanum. In 1870, the Jesuits had feared that VittorioEmanuel’s soldiers might plunder the library to make themselves a bit of money,so the collection was transferred to the Villa Mandragone in Frascati, north ofRome. This was where Voynich discovered the manuscript, while rummaging aroundin an old trunk. The Jesuits had needed money for restoration work to theirramshackle building and the brothers had readily offered the crafty booksellerfrom London cases full of yellowing manuscripts. Voynich purchased 30 oldvolumes and the Jesuits, who had thought themselves sly, never realized what atreasure they had pressed into Wilfrid Voynich’s willing hands.To an antiquarian like Wilfrid Voynich, who regularly dealt with piles uponpiles of ancient texts, the curious, multicolored parchment in the heavy darkbrown and matt-varnished trunk must have really leapt out and caught the eye.But what truly surprised him was a letter he found pressed between the frontcover and the first page. This letter, composed in Latin, had been written by acertain “Johannes Marcus Marci de Cronland” in Prague and was dated August 19,1666. It was addressed to his friend Athanasius Kircher and explained how he wassending him a work that no one could read. If anyone could decipher the text, hewrote, it would be Athanasius. On the origin of the manuscript, Marci wrote:Dr. Raphael, tutor in the Bohemian language to Ferdinand III, then King ofBohemia, told me the said book had belonged to the Emperor Rudolph and that hepresented to the bearer who brought him the book 600 ducats. He believed theauthor was Roger Bacon, the Englishman.4 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not4]This is where the story starts getting complicated.Emperor Rudolph II, crowned in 1576, was a melancholic man plagued by self-doubtand delusions who put great faith in astrologers and magicians, even sponsoringthem with gifts of money. At that time, Prague, Rudolph’s capital, was a centerof secret societies, alchemists, and occultists. Prague was the city of thegolem, a city where the Apocalypse (the “secret revelation” that follows thefour gospels of the New Testament) was a frequent topic of daily conversation.The Voynich manuscript would have fit rather well into that period, shortlybefore the outbreak of the Thirty Years’ War, as well as being something thatwould have appealed to the court of Rudolph II. Unfortunately, Marci had alsonoted in his letter to Athanasius that Emperor Rudolph also believed that themanuscript was the work of Roger Bacon.THE BACON CONNECTIONThis “hot tip” must have electrified Wilfrid Voynich, as Roger Bacon (c.1214–1294) was considered by many to be a universal genius. Bacon had studied inOxford and taught philosophy in Paris. He was the author of numerous works, suchas the Opus maius, the Opus minus, the Opus tertium, and a phenomenalencyclopedia. Bacon was way ahead of his time: he wrote about ships of thefuture that could be steered without a rudder and could be operated by a singleman, and about fighting vehicles that could move themselves with incrediblepower. He also had a few things to say about flying, even back in 1256: “Flyingmachines (instrumenta volandi) will be constructed…they were manufactured beforea time and it is certain that man will have an instrument to fly.”5[part0008.xhtml#ch01not5]Bacon, who also criticized the moral authority of the church, lived in dangeroustimes. After the publishing of his final work, Compendium studii Theologiae,Bacon was named Doctor Mirabilis for his linguistic and scientific achievement.Seemingly to show his conformity, he joined the Franciscan order, but very sooncame into conflict with his superiors and was even placed under monastic arrest.Is this same Roger Bacon who is supposed to be the author of the Voynichmanuscript? There is no proof, but it can’t be completely excluded as apossibility. A book of the scope of the Voynich manuscript, however, would haveprobably been too great a challenge—even for one as talented as Roger Bacon.After all, it contains a completely new alphabet, which defies all logic, andcolor illustrations of plants and utensils that existed nowhere in the world. Onthe other hand, Bacon must surely have had access to certain ancient texts;otherwise he could hardly have gone on about classical flying machines in histract about the “secret arts.”6 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not6] These kinds of flyingdevices were indeed often mentioned in ancient documents.The annals tell the tale of the Chinese king Cheng Tang, who owned “flyingwagons”7 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not7] that were not produced in his own workshops,but came from a distant folk called Chi Kung. This race lived 40,000 Li “beyondthe Jade gate.”8 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not8] Wherever that was, it must have beenat least halfway around the world, because one “Li” corresponded to 644.40meters. (That makes 40,000 Li more than 25,000 kilometers!) Word for word, theChi Kung people were described as follows:They could even manufacture flying wagons that, in a good wind, could covergreat distances. In the time of Tang [around 1760 B.C.] the west wind broughtsuch a wagon to Yu-Chou (Honan), whereupon Tang destroyed it because he did notwant his people to see such a thing.9 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not9]Chinese chronicler Kuo P’o (270–324 A.D.) picked up where his forebears leftoff, writing: “The intricate work of the fabulous Chi Kung people is trulyadmirable. Together with the wind, they have exerted their brains and invented aflying wagon which, climbing and sinking, depending on their path, broughtguests to Tang.”10 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not10]Flying machines such as these, although they may seem to us today a littlebizarre, have been preserved in drawings and wall paintings. King Cheng Tang hidthese ancient flyers from his subjects. His “chief engineer” Ki Kung Shi evenmanaged to replicate one of the heavenly wagons, but the flying monstrosity waslater destroyed to protect its secrets forever. Disarmament in ancient China! Inhis work Shang hai ti-shing, chronicler Kuo P’o tells of various occurrencesthat took place in that epoch.11 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not11] His writings notonly include reports on the flying wagons, but also describe flying wheels.My short detour on ancient aviation was not made without reason. Did Roger Baconknow of texts such as these? Those who are acquainted with my books know thatflying wagons appear in countless historical traditions; it’s just that no onetakes notice of them. Indian king Rumanvat, who reigned many thousand years ago,even had a massive sky ship built in which many groups of people could betransported at once.12 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not12] In the Indian epics Ramayanaand Mahabharata there are more than 50 passages that clearly describe flyingmachines,13 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not13] and in the Ethiopian Kebra Negast, theBook of the Glory of Kings, the description of King Solomon’s flying wagon evenincludes details of top speeds!14 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not14] And so on, and soon! Those who don’t know these ancient texts about aviation should keep quiet.It seems to me that Roger Bacon must have known at least one of these oldsources—and for that reason he didn’t stay quiet at all.All these ancient literary traditions from past epochs have a big problem (oneof many!): only a handful of people know the texts. On top of that, countlessthousands of books from the past no longer exist. The great library ofAlexandria went up in flames in 47 A.D. and again in 391 A.D. The same happenedwith the libraries of Jerusalem, Pergamon, and many other great cities ofantiquity where wars raged. And when Central America was conquered by thesoldiers of the cross, the monks—in their holy fervor—burnt thousands ofmanuscripts written by the Maya and the Aztecs. All that antiqueknowledge—simply gone up in smoke! Where are the originals of texts like Enoch,Solomon, Manetho, and the like? Where are the original works about Atlantis? Mylittle departure into the gulf of time reveals an insipid, unknowing societythat passes judgment as if it actually knew something.OFF TO THE UNITED STATESFollowing his exciting find in the Villa Mandragone in Frascati, Wilfrid Voynichtraveled to the United States in November 1914. He opened a small antiquarianbookshop and gave lectures to public and private circles. One person who wasparticularly impressed with the manuscript was philologist William Newbold,professor of Intellectual and Moral Philosophy at the University ofPennsylvania. In 1919, Professor Newbold began an attempt to decipher the text,even though he only had access to a few pages of the manuscript. He quicklydeveloped a theory that the Voynich manuscript contained microscopic charactersthat would only be revealed under extreme magnification. In a lecture hedelivered on April 20, 1921, Newbold claimed he was able to translate the crudetext. Unfortunately for him, he also believed that the manuscript had beenwritten by Roger Bacon. Ten years later, Professor Newbold’s decipherment wasdefinitively debunked. There are no hidden characters in the Voynich manuscript,and Newbold’s translation turned out to be just hot air: the wishful thinking ofan academic who would dearly have loved to make history himself.Wilfrid Voynich desperately needed money. He set the price of the manuscript at$160,000 and wasn’t prepared to budge. He was left sitting holding a pile ofcolored parchments of uncertain heritage that no one could read and no onewanted to buy—a manuscript, let’s not forget, with a blank cover, no title, andno author. By the time Wilfrid died in 1931, there was still no potential buyerin sight. He left the manuscript to his wife, Ethel, and his secretary, AnneNill. Following Ethel’s death, Nill finally managed to sell the pile ofparchments to an antique book dealer from New York, Hans-Peter Kraus, for$24,500. Kraus put the price back up to same amount that Voynich had demanded,$160,000, and, like Voynich himself before him, wasn’t willing to bargain. In1969 Kraus finally donated the manuscript to Yale University, which is where ithas remains to this day, in the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library withthe catalog number “MS 408.”A CRYPTOĢRAPHIC CHALLENĢEFor nearly 80 years, countless specialists have tried their hand at unravelingthe Voynich puzzle, including some of the world’s best cryptographers, who wouldusually not have the slightest problem cracking any code. These specialists haveanalyzed the frequency of glyphs, compared them with handwritten texts from the13th century, attempted to separate vowels from consonants. All in vain. UlliKulke, a science correspondent from the German journal DieWelt, covered one ofthe more recent attempts. He reported how British computer scientist Gordon Rugghad tried to use techniques from the 16th century to demonstrate that themanuscript was a fake. Rugg had used a table with 40 horizontal rows and 39vertical columns containing various groupings of Voynich characters. Afterward,he used a Cardan grille with three holes, which was moved about to displaycombinations of these characters. “The result was gibberish without any meaningwhatsoever, but with the same internal structure as the original text.”15[part0008.xhtml#ch01not15]The Voynich manuscript, however, consists of much more than just indefinablesyllables or “letters.” There are also the colored drawings that are placed leftor right on the parchment pages, often over and even in the middle of the text,as if the writing was describing the contents of the illustrations. So the nextquestion for the experts has to be: Is it really all made up? Is it forgery orwillful reverie of the kind that crops up every few years in one psychiatricclinic or other? In their excellent book about the Voynich manuscript, Kennedyand Churchill closely examine the bestestablished forgery theories withoutfinding any conclusive answer.16 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not16] Was the whole thingjust some kind of religious delusion, a torrent of inner or—if you like—heavenlyvoices scribbled down onto parchment by some delusional fanatic caught in thegrips of ecstasy? It’s not unknown to happen. Did some mad genius suddenlydecide, Now I’ll leave the researchers of the future some nut that they’ll neverbe able to crack? Could it really be Roger Bacon, the man with such greatknowledge of past ages, who was behind it all? Bacon would have had variousreasons for putting down his insights in a secret language—namely, keeping theclergy off his back. On the other hand, Bacon would never have produced anythingthat was indecipherable. It would have been enough for him that his critics,right up to the Pope himself, would be unable to read the text. He would havewanted his friends to know the key. But that would mean that there would have tobe some kind of system hidden in the text somewhere. Today’s cryptographers cancrack just about any code—especially with the computing power that’s availableto them nowadays—but only if the text is based on a certain amount of symmetryor has a particular logical structure. This logic is missing entirely from theVoynich text. Or did Bacon copy the Voynich manuscript from a much older sourcethat seemed to him to be important, although he couldn’t understand a word? Arethe words and pictures perhaps the work of some mystic intent on swindling KingRudolph II out of 600 ducats? That was a fortune back in those days. Or—and thisis the latest idea—is Voynich himself the forger? It is no secret that he livedpermanently beyond his means and always needed money. One of his contemporariesdescribed Voynich as “capable and dynamic, but unbearably coarse andarrogant.”17 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not17] Nevertheless, Voynich himself cannot bea candidate, as it has been shown that the manuscript definitely existed before1887.OLD, BUT HOW OLD?After all, what are modern dating methods for? The Voynich manuscript consistsof leaves of parchment that have been written on and drawn upon using variousinks and colors. Both the paper and the colors are organic, meaning they can bedated using C-14 dating techniques. Radiocarbon dating is a process thatmeasures amount of decay of the carbon-14 isotope. The halflife of carbon-14 isknown: after 5,600 years, half of the original amount of carbon-14 is gone;after 11,200 years, three quarters; and so on. The method isn’t 100-percentflawless, as it assumes a constant level of atmospheric carbon-14. However, theamount of carbon in the air actually fluctuates quite considerably. On top ofthat, carbon-14 is not especially reliable for artifacts that are only a fewcenturies old. And finally, the current owner of the manuscript, YaleUniversity, has steadfastly refused to make the document available fordating—for good reason. In 1965, Yale University acquired the so-called VinlandMap, a parchment mappa mundi depicting a large island to the west of Greenlandin exactly the location of present-day Newfoundland. If genuine, it would provethat the Vikings had discovered North America. In 1972, however, during achemical analysis of the ink used on the map, a team of scientists discoveredthat it contained a chemical substance that wasn’t used in inks until the 20thcentury. This meant the map had to be a fake. Allegedly. Further tests, whichwere carried out at various intervals until 1995, provided conflicting resultswith controversial datings. The dispute has, to this day, not been resolved. Forthis reason, Yale University has declined to have the Voynich manuscript datedusing the C-14 method.Even if it were possible to date the manuscript, it still wouldn’t mean an endto the controversy, as the question of the provenance of the text remains. Tomake it clearer: every devout Christian believes that the Bible contains theword of God, and, as far as the Gospels of the New Testament are concerned, thepopular belief is that the companions of Jesus of Nazareth wrote down everythingthat the master said or did, in a sort of running chronicle. These chronicleswere even given a name: the urtexts.In fact, none of that is true. The often-quoted and, in terms of theologicalrabulistics, very fertile original texts don’t even exist. What have we reallygot in our hands? Copies that were exclusively produced between the fourth and10th centuries after Christ’s death. And these copies, around 1,500 of them, arein themselves copies of copies; and not one single one of them completelyconcurs with any of the others. More than 80,000 (yes, eighty thousand!)deviations have been counted. There’s not one single page of these so-calledurtexts that doesn’t contain one contradiction or other. Each new edition wasthe author’s interpretation of the original verses rather than a direct copy,and was adapted to meet the needs and attitudes of the times. In the process,these biblical urtexts have amassed thousands of easily verifiable errors. Thebest-known of these texts, Codex Sinaiticus—like the Codex Vaticanus, written inthe fourth century—was found in 1844 in the Monastery of Saint Catherine at thefoot of Mount Sinai. It contains no less than 16,000 corrections (sixteenthousand!), which have been attributed to at least seven different editors. Someparts of the text have been corrected repeatedly and replaced with another pieceof original text. Professor Friedrich Delitzsch, a top expert, found 3,000 copyerrors in the text.18 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not18]What has all this got to do with the Voynich manuscript? I’ll explain. Let’sassume that the text and images are ancient. The content was copied ontoparchment in some old hermit’s cell without any changes being made to thetext—because by this time no one understood the slightest thing about what themanuscript was actually about. Perhaps it was believed to be a holy text orother important lore that was only to be read by initiates or in the distantfuture. The only thing that was important to the assiduous copiers was topreserve the original content for later generations, perhaps because theexisting manuscript had been eaten by moths and was beginning to decay. If thiswas the case then the manuscript would have no author. Even if the parchment andink of the Voynich manuscript were only 200 years old, the age of the originalcontent would remain a mystery. It is possible that a successful decipheringattempt will open up a precipice into ancient knowledge that will change theworld (inasmuch as the zeitgeist will let it be changed!). David Kahn, anAmerican cryptologist, predicts: the Voynich manuscript could be described as abomb that will go off on the day that it is finally decoded.19[part0008.xhtml#ch01not19]CURIOUSER AND CURIOUSERAs far as the content of the Voynich manuscript is concerned, for the time beingthere is very little to be said. The script and the illustrations in the textare another thing entirely. They can, to a certain extent, be sorted into roughcategories.Folios 2-66 feature plants together with their flowers and confusing tangles ofroots. Always accompanied by text.The following folios, 63–73, are filled with astronomical depictions of stars,the sun, the moon, possible zodiacal signs, and naked women lying around inbaths or bubbling out of tube-like openings.The 10 pages that follow provide little in the way of optical clues for ustoday. I can’t shake off the amateurish impression that they portray some kindof “health spa” or “fountain of youth,” as the women depicted seem to be risingfrom some kind of colored liquid. The rest is an indecipherable mix of stars ofdiffering sizes and colors, and in between is something that looks like anamulet and radiant flowers. Thirty-three folios are pure text, line afterunreadable line.The manuscript itself is made up of different-sized parchments, most of themaround 23 by 15 centimeters. Curiously, the pages are numbered in a styletypical of that used in the 16th century. Whoever the author or the scribe was,he seems to have been conversant with the ciphers of the time. The curves andstrokes, embellishments reminiscent of shorthand, and “g”-and “o”-like loops donot seem to be comparable to any known alphabet, least of all Ancient Greek,Latin, or even Cyrillic. Despite all this, the longer I dwelled on the text themore I had a feeling that I had seen something similar in a completely differentcorner of the Earth. The story is turning somersaults and maybe my littlecontribution will help the cryptographers in some small way toward solving theriddle.ARTIFACTS IN ECUADORIn Ecuador, the hot, tropical country straddling the equator in South America,there is a small town called Cuenca. There is a church there that carries thename Maria Auxiliadora, which translates roughly as “the helpful mother of God.”For 50 years, the Catholic diocese was looked after by a certain Father CarloCrespi.image [../Images/image00154.jpeg]Father Crespi displaying some of the treasures from his collection.He enjoyed a reputation as a friend of the Indios, and even during his lifetimethe folk of Cuenca regarded him as a saint. Father Crespi died in 1982 and thepeople built a monument in his name that is, to this day, decorated every daywith fresh flowers. What was so special about this padre? He listened to theIndios—for hours, or even days if need be. He won their trust and helped themout in all sorts of difficult situations.The Indios expressed their gratitude by showering gifts upon the kindlypreacher. The religious artifacts are of the kind that aren’t exactly approvedof by the Catholic Church; artifacts that their families had kept hidden fromthe white men for hundreds of years. Father Crespi initially placed the objectsagainst the wall of his inner courtyard. But as their number increased, he wasforced to start piling them up in a shed behind the church. The flow of gifts,however, didn’t let up, and Crespi was forced to open up two further rooms inwhich he piled up some of the most amazing treasures that I have ever seen.image [../Images/image00155.jpeg]More items from Father Crespi’s collection.image [../Images/image00156.jpeg]Some of the artifacts in the Crespi collection are elaborately carved.image [../Images/image00157.jpeg]Panels, figures, and totems stacked up against each other.Scientists have never really thoroughly examined Father Crespi’s treasures. Ithas even been claimed that they were all modern fakes and forgeries. Well, it isquite possible that some of the panels, figures, and totems were indeed made inthe last century, but some of them can’t possibly have been. Since the arrivalof the Spanish conquistadores, the indigenous peoples of South America have beendevout Christians, yet there is no trace of Christian imagery on any of thepieces in Crespi’s collection: no cross, no Madonna, no Jesus, no biblicalquotes. The artistic style of the artifacts originates from a pre-Christianepoch. The faces on the metal panels are outlandish, and the entire style andcountless symbols do not fit in with any customary art-historical thinking.Often, the engraved metal panels are so complex and so extensively complementedby innumerable small illustrations that one is tempted to think of them asbelonging to a unique school.There are metal panels lying around with serial narratives, and no one pays themthe slightest bit of attention. There is a confusing cornucopia of images thatmake up compositions that flow into one another. Faces with solar coronas andheads reminiscent of giraffes with radiating beams, intertwined with apelike,anxious-looking faces with snakes growing out of them. All in all, there are toomany details for them to be simple forgeries, and too much background knowledgefor a single mad genius. One of the golden panels features stars in its upperleft- and right-hand corners, then a being with a bloated belly and snakeliketail, a ratlike creature, a man in an armored tunic with attached helmet, atriangular figure with a hole through its middle, and—on the opposite side—afigure with rays shooting out of his head.Finally, there are faces, wheels, birds, snakes, and—in the middle—somethingthat looks like an arrow pointing downward. It’s chaos at a level to match theVoynich manuscript, but not a good candidate for a forgery because there’snothing there that could really be forged or copied. But this is just thebeginning, and maybe we are starting to get a little closer to solving theVoynich riddle.image [../Images/image00158.jpeg]A stone pyramid featuring undecipherable writing and an elephant.Father Crespi was not just some adventurous figure who popped up out of theblue. He was a priest, and the Indios told him that their treasures all camefrom the secret stores of their forefathers. What reason could the Indios havehad to lie to their so well-respected and loved padre? Or to present him withcheap, homemade kitsch? I’m really grateful that I had the chance to takepictures of this unique collection while Father Crespi was still alive.It is possible—on the other hand—to argue about the material these incomparableart works are made of. Crespi himself believed that below the golden surface ofthese metal panels one would actually find pure gold. But you need to know thatthe even the pre-Inca tribes had mastered unbelievably complex techniques forsmelting and making alloys that we are unable to duplicate even today.20[part0008.xhtml#ch01not20] Their sophisticated casting techniques and gildingprocesses used a mixture of 50-percent copper, 25-percent silver, and 25-percentgold. The external color of an object has little reflection of the amount ofgold actually used. The Incas were able coat objects with a gold layer that wasonly half a micrometer thick and—when viewed through a microscope—only visibleat a magnification level of 500×. They had mastered techniques that allowed themto give any base metal the appearance of pure gold.When an alloy of copper-silver-tin or even copper-gold-tin is heated, the noblemetal enhances the surface of the metal while the copper component is graduallylost to oxidation. Finally, the surface gains the appearance of pure gold. Ifthe alloy contains both silver and gold, both metals come to the surface, givingthe metal a pale silvery or pale yellow sheen. It seems as if the unknownartists intentionally plated their messages with a thin coating of preciousmetal so that they would survive the millennia. Just like the Voynichmanuscript, the Crespi collection defies categorization.image [../Images/image00159.jpeg]“Stylized spermatozoa, grinning suns, the crescent of a waning moon.”AMAZINĢ AND IMPOSSIBLEThirty-five years ago, I photographed some amazing and impossible things inCarlo Crespi’s storerooms. There was a disc with a diameter of around 22centimeters decorated with stylized spermatozoa, grinning suns, the crescent ofa waning moon, a large star, and two square, manlike faces.I also saw a pyramid, flanked on the left and right by jumping cats. In the skywas a snake, above the pyramid a sun, and on each side of that four and fivesquiggles. Along the base of the pyramid is an unmistakable band of rune-likecharacters—symbols that no one has ever been able to decipher—and on each sideof the pyramid’s base, an elephant. Heaven help us! There have never beenelephants roaming around South America, neither before nor after the Incas.Admittedly, elephant bones have been excavated in Mexico, but they are said tobe more than 12,000 years old. I also found a similar set of symbols—16 of them,arranged in a four-by-four square—decorating a gilded collar. The pictures proveit.The craziest piece that Crespi showed me, however—and, according to the manhimself, it came from an underground metal library, about which I’ll tell youmore in the next chapter—was a gilded metal panel with 56 squares. The panel isdivided into 14 horizontal strips, each strip into four squares, and each squaredepicting a character that appeared to have been stamped into the metal. Some ofthese symbols display an uncanny similarity to symbols from the Voynichmanuscript. Could this panel be some kind of Rosetta Stone for decrypting theVoynich manuscript? I know no more than you, my dear reader, but one thing I cantell you—and indeed with some certainty—and that is that thousands of years agothere were texts that were never registered in any library and that were broughtto the Earth by extraterrestrial beings. Texts that defy any earthly logic, thatcontradict the symmetry of every alphabet, and that could only ever betranslated when enough material was available for comparison. Texts by aliens? Alittle far-fetched? When are they supposed to have been here? How? Whattechnology did the ETs use to span the light years and, even then, what on Earthcould they want from us? And to top it all, they left us texts? A pretty crazynotion! How can we corroborate this? Well, there really are historical writingsthat back up the idea of extraterrestrial texts—it’s just that no one knowsabout them. Here is the dossier:AN INTERĢALACTIC DOSSIER?In his dialog Phaedrus, the philosopher Plato quotes a history that he heardfrom Socrates:21 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not21]“At the Egyptian city of Naucratis, there was a famous old god, whose name wasTheuth; the bird which is called the Ibis is sacred to him, and he was theinventor of many arts, such as arithmetic and calculation and geometry andastronomy and draughts and dice, but his great discovery was the use ofletters….”The god Theuth passed on the gift of writing to the pharaoh:“This, said Theuth, will make the Egyptians wiser and give them better memories;it is a specific both for the memory and for the wit.”The pharaoh saw another side to this marvelous invention and contradicted thegod Theuth:“…this discovery of yours will create forgetfulness in the learners’ souls,because they will not use their memories; they will trust to the externalwritten characters and not remember of themselves. The specific which you havediscovered is an aid not to memory, but to reminiscence….”And indeed, he was right: these millennia-old texts can only recall events thatare otherwise long forgotten. Who remembers, for example, that God—whoever he,she, or it may be—created other worlds long before the creation of Earth? It canbe read in the ancient legends of the Jews:Thousands of worlds did the Lord create in the beginning; then he created stillmore worlds…. The Lord created worlds and then destroyed them; he planted treesand pulled them up again, for they were still confused…and he continued tocreate worlds and to destroy worlds until he created our world. Then he spake:This world is a great pleasure to me, those others pleased me not.22[part0008.xhtml#ch01not22]Creating and destroying worlds because they didn’t quite fit the bill? Intoday’s parlance, we call that “terraforming.”23 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not23] Thatis a process for transforming uninhabitable planets into worlds that are fit forhuman habitation. One such idea involves dumping large quantities ofcyanobacteria into the Martian atmosphere. These bacteria multiply rapidly and,in the process, produce large quantities of oxygen.Was it really mankind that—during a long and drawn out process of becomingintelligent—thought up the idea of writing down symbols to preserve knowledge?Of course! Who else? I hear you cry. Can you be so sure? The ancient legendstell that writing existed two thousand years before the creation of“intelligent” man. Back then, there were no scrolls of parchment and no animalswhose skins could be used, not even metal. And in the absence of trees, nowooden panels, this book existed in the form of a hallowed sapphire. An angelnamed Raziel, “the very same one who sat by the stream that flowed out of Eden,”passed this strange “book” on to our progenitor, Adam.24[part0008.xhtml#ch01not24] It must have been a wholly curious specimen, becauseit contained not only all that was worth knowing, but also prophecies about thefuture. Adam was to draw wealth from this wonderful book and all those who cameafter him: “Also, of your children who will come after you…will any who use thisbook…know what is to come. Whether it be misfortune, the coming of hunger,whether the grain will be too plentiful or too scarce, whether deluge or droughtwill reign in the land.”25 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not25]How can any lexicon or even encyclopedia today compare to that kind ofsuperbook? We need to seek the authors of that phenomenal work among theheavenly legions, for after the angel Raziel had given our ancestor the book andeven read a little from it for him, something quite amazing followed:“And in that hour, when Adam received the book, arose a great flame on the banksof the river, and the angel rode up in the blaze into heaven.”26[part0008.xhtml#ch01not26]ANĢELS OR ETS?While we’re on the subject: what is an angel exactly? They appear in practicallyevery piece of religious literature, and they are definitely not of this Earth.And they are clearly not spirits that could be dreamt up or imagined, for theseangels are in the possession of some pretty powerful weapons, which they use tochastise mankind. Some of them even had their wicked way with the daughters ofmen (I’ll be getting back to that later in “The Truth Behind Enoch”section)—which isn’t exactly a fine or heavenly manner of behaving. So if angelswere not terrestrial, the only option that remains is that they wereextraterrestrial. And these angels (extraterrestrials) knew about the future?It’s simple, really. When man is finally capable of interstellar spaceflight andlands on a planet peopled by Stone Age beings, we probably won’t find it toohard to tell these natives a thing or two about their futures either.Of course, I don’t mean predictions about individuals, but rather about theirfuture societies. We could tell them about specific technologies that they willinvent, because they are an intrinsic part of development, or how they willsuffer from environmental problems if their population grows withoutcheck—because you can’t have one without the other. Or, even better: we willprophesize about how their descendents will be able to split the tiniest unitsof matter; how this will be dangerous because it could lead to the destructionof great swathes of the planet, making them uninhabitable for centuries(H-bombs). This trick can also be used for smaller periods of time, such asfuture harvests, plagues of locusts, or the seeming immortality of thecockchafer. The indigenous people might not understand any of it, but they canwrite it down and preserve the knowledge for the future.A MAĢICAL BOOKIn the story of Adam’s book, it’s the same thing:Within the book were embedded the higher symbols of the holy wisdom, and theseventy-two types of sciences were contained therein, which in their place weredivided into the six hundred and seventy symbols of the higher secrets. Also,the fifteen hundred keys, which were not entrusted to the holy ones of the upperworld, were hidden in that book.27 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not27]Did you know that there were “seventy-two types of sciences” that can be furthersubdivided into “six hundred and seventy symbols” of even higher knowledge? It’sa bit like our subdivision of physics into atomic physics, particle physics,astrophysics, and so on. Or the umbrella term biology, which covers a spectrumfrom single-celled animals, to insects, elephants, and right on up toexobiology.Adam bequeathed this magical book to his 10-year-old son Seth. He must have beena pretty switched-on lad, because Adam told him in detail “about the strengthsof the book,” but also “wherein its power and miracles lie.”28[part0008.xhtml#ch01not28] He also explained to him how he had used the book andthat he had hidden it in a cleft in a rock.Seth received the paternal instructions, learned diligently from the holysapphire, and finally constructed “…a golden ark, laid the book within and hidthe ark in a cave….”29 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not29]Much later, the knowledge from the sapphire passed into the hands of Noah, theman who saved mankind from the Flood, and he used it to understand the coursesof the planets through the heavens, “also the paths of Aldebaran, Orion andSirius…also the names of every individual heaven…and the names of the heavenlyservants.”30 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not30]The fantastic story of the Adam book could quite easily be filed away under“just a story,” if it weren’t for a few things that just go against the grain. Iunderstand the urge to slip a book—metaphorically speaking—to our ancientancestor, because the lonesome patriarch must have gotten his knowledge fromsomewhere. But the idea with the sapphire I find harder to swallow. How on Earthdid they come up with that one? The concept of an encyclopedia stored on aprecious jewel would have been pretty obscure for a few centuries ago, let alonea few millennia. These days, we have technologies that allow us to store copiousquantities of data onto crystals. And Adam is said to have carried on dialogswith this book. How did that come about? Where did the author of this story getthat idea from? Nowadays, just about everyone has “dialogs” with his or hercomputer. But that kind of thinking just doesn’t fit in with the ancient past.And where did the idea come from, all those thousands of years ago, to adddetails to the Adam story such as the “seventy-two types of sciences,” which thebook is said to contain? Or the “six hundred and seventy symbols of the highersecrets” and the “fifteen hundred keys”? Specific information like that doesn’tjust come off the cuff. I don’t want to overrate the contents of this long-lostbook, and yet I have to ask myself why the storyteller placed such value onspecific constellations of stars. Why was it important to Adam or hisdescendents to know the astronomical paths of Aldebaran, Sirius, or Orion?They’re not of any use for any terrestrial calendar.Adam, Seth, and Noah are also said to have learned the names of the individualheavens from this book, too. Wait a minute! Isn’t there just one heaven? Whatare they talking about?In fact, we can learn about them in the ancient Jewish legends.31[part0008.xhtml#ch01not31] The first heaven is called Wilon, from which allmankind is observed. Above Wilon lies Raqia, wherein the stars and planets lie.The next level is called Shehaqim, and above lie Zebul, Maon, and Makon.Finally, above Makon, lies the seventh and highest heaven, called Araboth. Thisis said to be the home of the Cherubim and some kind of heavenly bodies known asHoly Wheels. Often, the distances between the different heavens are alsoprovided, along with units of measurement and time periods: between the heavens,for instance, lie “ladders” and “epochs spanning five hundred years.” It allsounds an awful lot like space travel.This pepped-up tale from ancient time sounds thoroughly implausible. Nothingmore than “foolish fantasy,” as the theologian Dr. Eisenmenger mockingly claimedalmost three hundred years ago.32 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not32] Legends are animprecise form of story-telling: grotesque and wonderful, fascinating andbloodcurdling at the same time. What’s more, legends tend to pay littleattention to chronology and are not worried in the slightest about historicalfacts. The legend is “popular speculation and popular fantasy”33[part0008.xhtml#ch01not33] and yet remains in the popular memory. Legends andmyths, however, are not built on nothing. They are not simply tall stories; theyalways contain a kernel of truth that quite often also crops up—presto!—in thetraditions of numerous other peoples or civilizations, albeit with other namesand other heroes.A CREATURE FROM THE SEAI’m no closer to the Voynich manuscript than before. But I wanted to concentrateon my theory that gods or angels—in other words, beings that are not of thisEarth—had dictated or otherwise passed on books to mankind. Maybe you’ve heardof the legendary creature Oannes (Sumerian: Abgallu)?At a time when Alexander the Great still reigned over Babylon (around 350 B.C.),there lived a priest and historian of Marduk (also known as Bel or Ba’al) calledBerossus. Berossus wrote a three-volume work in the Greek language, theBabyloniaca. The first book dealt with astronomy and the creation of the world;the second dealt with the 10 kings that reigned before the flood and the 86kings that followed; the third book is a history chronicling the period up tothe time of Alexander the Great. Unfortunately only fragments of the Babyloniacaremain, but Lucius Seneca and Flavius Josephus, a contemporary of Jesus, quotefrom it. Berossus refers to a much older document, writing:In the first year there appeared, from that part of the Erythræan Sea [today’sPersian Gulf], which borders upon Babylonia, an animal endowed with reason, bythe name of Oannes…. Its voice was articulate and human, and an image of him hasbeen preserved to this day. This creature spent its days among men, but ate nofood; and gave them insights into letters and sciences, and arts of every kind.He taught them to build cities and temples, how to draw up laws and measure theland. He showed them how to sow the seeds and how to collect the fruits; heinstructed them in everything which could humanize their lives. From that time,nothing material has been added by way of improvement to his instructions.Oannes also wrote a book about the genesis of man and the origin of civilstates, which he then gave to mankind [author’s italics].34[part0008.xhtml#ch01not34]Does this book even exist anywhere? Is there, perhaps, a copy hidden somewherebeneath an ancient temple, watched over by cowled guardians who themselves haveno idea what kind of treasure is in their hands? It seems clear that Oannes’sbook of learning, even in Berossus’s time, wasn’t simply to be found in thenearest library. So, is it all just chitchat?Wait a moment! In the holy book of the Parsees, the Avesta, a mysterious beingnamed Yma appears from the sea and instructs the people. In the legends of thePhoenicians a creature with the same origins and abilities was known as Taut,and in ancient China, at the time of Emperor Fuk-Hi, a creature called Meng-hoarose from the water: “a monster with the body of a horse and the head of adragon, whose back was laden with tablets filled with letters.”35[part0008.xhtml#ch01not35] The great Tibetan master Padmasambhava (also known asU-Rgyab Pad-Ma brought down incomprehensible texts from the heavens. Before hedied, his students deposited these texts in a cave for later times, “in whichthey could be understood” [author’s italics].36 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not36] Mostprobably, we would have just as much luck deciphering them as we’ve had with theVoynich manuscript—and that was only written a few hundred years ago!WISDOM FROM THE GODSAnd where did mankind even get all these methods of writing from? Are they allsimply made up? Cuneiform, hieroglyphics, alphabets? If you believe the ancientchroniclers, it was those self-same ominous gods who taught their respective“chosen ones” how to write. They probably sought out the most intelligent peoplethey could find.Diodorus of Sicily, the author of a 40-volume historical library, tells in hisfirst book how the gods founded many cities in Egypt alone and also how they hadleft their progeny behind them: “First the gods weaned mankind fromcannibalism.”37 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not37] Then they taught man—according toDiodorus—the arts, mining, how to make tools, how to till the soil and how tomake wine. Even the art of writing came from the gods: “Namely, it was they whofirst categorized and developed all the comprehensible languages, and much wasgiven a name for which previously there had been no concept. The invention ofwriting also was down to him [the god]….”38 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not38]These stories clearly originate from more than just one single ancient source.The fragments all fit, just like in a crime novel. And you don’t have to beSherlock Holmes to put all the individual pieces together. These gods and angelsexisted—even if the thought of it makes us want to tear our hair out. And theywrought changes, too. The greatest witness to all this was Enoch, and writingabout him again is almost embarrassing, as I’ve already dealt with him innumerous books. But to stress my assertion that it was some kind ofextraterrestrial figures—call them gods or angels if you will—who instructedmankind, gave them letters, and even taught them how to write, it’s pretty hardto ignore Enoch. He is namely the only eyewitness who experienced everything inperson and wrote all of his chronicles in the first person, the “I” form. Enochis a perfect example of how twisted theology has, for many centuries, managed tofalsify the truth and sweep the facts under the carpet, and to turn a work basedon personal experience into a hocus pocus of gibberish and interpretation—and itreally makes me pretty angry just thinking about it. Yet it is not really allthat difficult to debunk some of these theological irritations. You just need toexamine the content.With Enoch, of course, I am faced with the same dilemma as in each previousbook: how do I explain something to my readers without constantly repeatingthings I have written before? Schoolteachers and university lecturers have aneasier time of it. They can assume that their students already understand thebasics. If you don’t know your ABCs, you can’t read. But I can’t assume that youalready know about Enoch. Maybe you are a new reader, one who has justdiscovered my way of looking at things. And on top of that, many of my olderbooks are no longer in print. So, what can I do? I’ll try and cut this Gordianknot by restricting myself to repeating only what is necessary for the newreader, whereby the repetitions will not exactly be repetitions. A note to myfaithful long-term readers: you will find out things about Enoch in this bookthat have never been revealed before.Although I’m no fan of convoluted theological literature, I admire the men whoare responsible for creating it (and yes, we are just speaking about men here!).The translators of the ancient Enoch texts were all extremely well educated.Without exception, they spoke many languages, were men of integrity, and made asincere effort to unravel the millennia-old confusion. But they were alltheologians, which derives from the words theos (god) and logos (word)—the wordof God. But that’s not precisely what theology deals with. All these theologiansof bygone days were, of course, thoroughly convinced that they were working onthe words of God—otherwise they may never have chosen that career—but this veryconviction is already an aspect of faith. They truly believed that these holy,and sometimes not-so-holy, writings came directly from the mouth of God, that hehad dictated them or revealed them in some wonderful way to the chosen. Whatremains of texts when the element of belief is removed? The words themselves.They have lost nothing except their sanctity. They may remain venerable, becausethey are old; one may treat them with respect, because they reveal events fromages that are lost to us; and they should be scientifically analyzed, becausethey are packed with extremely interesting material. As soon as a text has lostits sanctity, it can be discussed objectively. It is our conception of theinviolability of these texts that prevents any topical analysis.So, let’s start to really stir up some trouble!THE STORY OF ENOCHWho is this Enoch character?In “The Ancient Legends of the Jews,” Enoch is a “king over all men,” whoreigned for exactly 243 years. In the book of Genesis, Enoch is mentioned as oneof the ten patriarchs who ruled before the flood. In the Bible, Enoch is dealtwith in five sentences (Genesis 5:21-24): “(21) When Enoch had lived 65 years,he became the father of Methuselah. (22) And after he became the father ofMethuselah, Enoch walked with God 300 years and had other sons and daughters.(23) Altogether, Enoch lived 365 years. (24) Enoch walked with God; then he wasno more, because God took him away.”39 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not39]Just like that—gone in the blink of an eye. In the Hebrew language the wordEnoch means “the initiated one,” “the insightful one,” or “the skillful one.”And this initiated one made sure, God be praised, that his knowledge didn’tdisappear with him, much to the chagrin of those fools who would rather haveseen Enoch and all his knowledge go up in smoke. Because Enoch is dynamite fortoday’s society—and that’s where the trouble starts. But let’s take a step back:what do other peoples, apart from the Israelites, have to say about Enoch?In ancient Egypt, Enoch was the builder of the Great Pyramid, or at least thatis the claim made by Taqi al-Din Ahmad ibn Ali ibn Abd al-Qadir ibn Muhammadal-Maqrizi (1363-1442) in his work Khitat. He noted that Enoch was known bydifferent names among the different peoples: Saurid, Hermes, Idris, and Enoch.Here is the passage from the Khitat, chapter 33:…the first Hermes, who was named thrice in his capacity as prophet, king andwise man (it is he who Hebrews name Enoch, son of Jared, son of Mahalel, son ofKenan, son of Enos, son of Seth, son of Adam—praised be his name—and that isIdris), he read in the stars that the flood would come. Then he had the pyramidsbuilt and hid within them treasures, learned books and everything which hefeared could be otherwise lost, so that those things would remain safe [author’sitalics].40 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not40]According to the Sumerian king list “WB444,” an engraved stone block that can beadmired in the British Museum in London, 10 great kings ruled between thecreation and the flood. The entire length of their reigns was 456,000 years.After the flood, the kingship descended once more from heaven, according to theSumerian king list. It seemed as though they had liked it on the blue planet.The 23 kings that occupied the throne after the flood managed a lesser, butstill not insignificant total of 24,510 years, three months, and three and ahalf days in charge. The seventh of the antediluvian rulers is said to havelived in the city of sun, Sippar. The gods Shamash and Adad are said to haveselected him to be the first to learn the arts of writing and prophecy. Thisseventh king, according to the Bible, would have been Enoch. The fame of thisseventh king was so great that in later years the great Babylonian rulerNebuchadnezzar I (around 1100 B.C.) was said to have derived his bloodline fromhim. Translations of cuneiform writings made over the last few decades haverevealed that it was precisely this seventh king “who ascended into heaven.”41[part0008.xhtml#ch01not41] Like Enoch. Sumerologists, like theologians, both ofwhom swim in the currents of contemporary rationality, interpret this as somekind of “rapture” and thus describe the cuneiform texts as the “earliest writtenrecord of an ascension.”42 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not42] The figure of this seventhruler of the sun city Sippar “inspired the religious fantasy and fabulizing oflater Judaism.”43 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not43] The proof of this is thecoalescence of various fragments from the diverse Enoch books. But now I willshow you why this notion is somewhat wide of the mark.THE DISCOVERY OF THE BOOK OF ENOCHThe news that the Book of Enoch had been found reached Europe in the first halfof the 18th century. While exploring Africa, Scottish adventurer James Bruce(1730-1794) not only discovered the source of the Blue Nile, he also broughtthree copies of an Enoch text back with him to London. The texts were translatedinto somewhat poor English by Professor Richard Laurence, but Enoch didn’treally become a subject of scientific discussion until German orientalist andprotestant theologian August Dillman (1823–1894) translated the scrolls intoGerman. Since then, more than 30 more Ethiopian manuscripts have been added tothe original documents. But where did Bruce get his hands on the texts?When the church fathers edited—or, to use the technical term, canonized—theBible in the fourth century, they had many more texts than now appear in theBible. But many of these texts were incomplete, had gaps in them or were justplain incomprehensible. So these fragments didn’t make it into the Bible.Nevertheless, these rejected texts were not simply thrown out; instead, theywere put to one side—including Enoch texts. The texts later came to be referredto as the “Apocrypha and Pseudoepigrapha of the Old Testament.”44[part0008.xhtml#ch01not44] The Abyssinian church, on the other hand, had adoptedEnoch into its canon—one good reason why James Bruce found the text in Ethiopia.Later on, a Slavonic variant of the same Book of Enoch also turned up, andhighly academic textual comparisons revealed that the similarities of thefundamental aspects of the two books could only be attributed to commonauthorship. And that’s where the theological arguments started.The Book of Enoch describes many impossible things: journeys into the heavens,visits to other worlds, astronomical teachings, conversations with “angels” anda being with the appellation “Most High,” and tribunals for “fallen angels” andmen. What does it all mean?Theologians and classical scholars, men with phenomenal linguistic ability, yetall following their “theos logos” and religious psychology, all looked forsolutions. What else could they have done? Enoch’s descriptions are turned into“parables” (sometimes called “similitudes”), “visions,” “inspirations,”“dreams,” “inventions,” “stories,” or—and this really takes the biscuit—it isclaimed that the entire Book of Enoch is the work of several Jewish priests andthe whole thing is simply a “personification of the Jewish race.”45[part0008.xhtml#ch01not45]And indeed, the Book of Enoch has been repeatedly doctored and changedaround—much like the urtexts of the New Testament. For instance, the term son ofman crops up and it can be seen that it has been added later in an Ethiopianhand. Similarly, the terms the chosen and the just. Theologians argue that theseterms refer to the Jewish race. The whole thing became even more confusing when,sometime in the fifth century, a Hebrew version of the Book of Enoch featuringcountless elaborations also did the rounds, but was not taken seriously becauseit was—allegedly—based on a vision experienced by the Jewish Rabbi Ishma’el.That led to the Book of Enoch being lumped together with the Gnostic writings.Today, Gnosticism is generally associated with a kind of esoteric philosophy,weltanschauung, or religion. The word gnosis is Greek and means “recognition.”Regardless of where Rabbi Ishma’el got his mysterious information from, he couldnot possibly have simply made it up, because it is far too complicated anddetailed. Before I march on to the Slavonic and Greek versions of the Book ofEnoch, here are a few highly curious snippets of information from the Hebrewtext.THE HEBREW BOOK OF ENOCHRabbi Ishma’el claims to have traveled up to heaven and met with an angel calledMetatron, who then showed him around. This same Metatron then revealed himselfto be none other than Enoch. Unlike the other versions, in the Hebrew bookMetatron/Enoch is not able to return to Earth and to mankind, but insteadremains in the vicinity of the throne of the “Most High” and only the seer RabbiIshma’el can reach him. Metatron/Enoch tells the Rabbi that the Lord calls him“Youth.” He explains why: “Happy art thou and happy is thy father for thyCreator doth favor thee. And because I am small and a youth among them in days,months and years, therefore they call me ‘Youth.’”46 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not46]And how did Metatron/Enoch come to be in the heavenly realm?When the Holy One, blessed be He, desired to lift me up on high, He first sentAnaphiel, the prince, and he took me from their midst before their very eyes andcarried me in great glory upon a fiery chariot drawn by fiery horses…. When theHoly One, blessed be He, took me away from the generation of the Flood, helifted me on the wings of the wind of Shekina to the highest heaven and broughtme into the great palaces of the Araboth Raqia on high, where [can be seen] theglorious Throne of Shekina.47 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not47]We find out that “Holy One” loves the Youth (Metatron/Enoch) very much; indeedhe loves him even “more than all [his] servants” and has thus written letterswith a flaming stylus and revealed to Metatron/Enoch not only how Heaven andEarth came into being, but also the seas and rivers, mountains and hills,lightning, thunder, sound and storm, and even the planets and constellations.Not bad, this all-embracing, interstellar knowledge given to Metatron/Enoch. Athought at the back of my mind brings me to Abraham, who also ascended intoHeaven and saw the Earth “under him.”48 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not48] Or Enkidufrom the Epic of Gilgamesh, who is carried out across the Earth on “eagle’swings.”49 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not49], 50 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not50] Or “Arjuna’sjourney to Indra’s heaven.”51 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not51] And when heavenly“Wheels” or “halls in the firmament” appear in the Hebrew Book of Enoch, I amreminded of the “wheels” in the Book of Dzyan52 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not52] andthe “heavenly cities” in the Sanskrit epic Mahabharata.53[part0008.xhtml#ch01not53] There are countless similar cases scatteredthroughout classical literature. The difference between the theologians andmyself is that I look at texts from all religions and regions of the world,while the scholars of the Judaeo-Christian tradition restrict themselvesexclusively to the writings in the Bible and the Apocrypha. Every single one ofthem.In the Hebrew Book of Enoch, Rabbi Ishma’el lists a plethora of different worlds(planets) along with their denominations. He knows the names of each of theirleaders, princes, or kings, and even tells of a heavenly library: “He broughtforth the casket of writings with the Book of Memories and placed them beforethe Holy One, praised be He. And he broke open the seal of the casket, openedit, took the books from within and gave them to the Holy One, praised be He….”54[part0008.xhtml#ch01not54]Heaven, saints, Most High, princes, servants, archangels, wheels, planets, fierychariots, heavenly legions—heaven help us! Did this Enoch even exist? So far, Ihave told you seven of his aliases: Enoch, Saurid, Hermes, Idris, Metatron,“Youth,” and the seventh antediluvian king. Which is the right one, then?Probably none of our phonetic spellings or pronunciations. Biblical Hebrew was alanguage written purely in consonants—no vowels at all. To make it easier toread, the vowels are indicated, if at all, by a system of dots (niqqud). Aphonetic-reading of Enoch could therefore just as easily be Inich, Onuch, orAnich, and Metatron could even be Mototran. Here, of course, I am not taking thecabbalistic interpretations into account, because in that system each letter caneven also be assigned a numerical value.Hebrew experts estimate that the Ethiopian texts were originally written betweenthe fifth and second centuries B.C.—and that leads us to the first problem. Fromthe texts themselves, it emerges that the texts deal with the history of theseventh patriarch. His name was—we’ll stick with the standard form—Enoch.Therefore, his name was appended to the Books of Enoch. Enoch, for his part, didnot live, however, between the fifth and second centuries B.C. That means thatthe original content must have been written down much earlier, before the flood.This is confirmed by the author himself, as you can clearly see from thefollowing examples:55 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not55] (The numbers in parenthesesrefer to chapter and verse.)(81, 1 ff) “And he said unto me: ‘Observe, Enoch, these heavenly tablets, readwhat is written thereon, and mark you well every single fact.’ And I observedthe heavenly tablets, and read everything which was written thereon….”(82, 1) “And now, my son Methuselah, all these things I am recounting to theeand writing down for thee! …preserve, my son Methuselah, the books thou hastreceived from thy father’s hand, and deliver them to the generations of theworld….”(83, 2) “Two visions I saw before I took a wife, and the one was quite unlikethe other: the first when I was learning to write: the second before I took thymother….”(87, 3 ff)“And those three that had last come forth grasped me by my hand andtook me up, away from the generations of the earth, and raised me up to a loftyplace, and showed me a tower raised high above the earth, and all the hills werelower.”(91, 1) “And now, my son Methuselah, call to me all thy brothers and gathertogether to me all the sons of thy mother….”(92, 1) “Enoch indeed wrote this complete doctrine of wisdom….”These quotes show that it was Enoch, however he might have been known during hisown lifetime, who wrote the verses. He confirms his authorship by his use of thefirst person, as if he had feared that the minds of the future might otherwisehave been too limited to understand. And indeed, to this very day exegetesignore the fact that this document is written in the first person. The originalof the book, its essence, comes from the antediluvian Enoch, otherwise he couldhardly have spoken of Methuselah as his son, or have listed his lineage back toAdam. To claim that it is some kind of pre-Christian forgery is to accuse theauthor of lying from start to finish. To deny that Enoch is the antediluvianauthor is to cast the whole of exegesis into a poor light and is also afundamental departure from reality. It’s yet another outrageous example of howthe faithful have been manipulated. Of course, the Book of Enoch is passed offas a “vision.” It’s a standard method of putting aside just about anything thatis otherwise hard to swallow. The fact that Enoch repeatedly says that he isfully awake is swept under the carpet. And in addition to that, he gives hisfamily explicit instructions of what to do after his departure. It can hardlyhave been a “vision of his own death”—another bright idea from the exegetes—asthe highly literate Enoch returned from his meeting with the angels fit as afiddle. Only at the end of the story does he take his final leave of hiskinsmen—in a chariot of fire.THE TRUTH BEHIND ENOCHEnoch, or Mister X—I think I’ll stick with the seventh patriarch and call himEnoch from now on—lived in an age that understood nothing of modern technology.There is no way he could have known about mother ships, shuttle craft,headlamps, loudspeakers, radio devices, booming motors, and so on. Everythingthat he experienced had to be paraphrased so that he was even in a position todescribe it, because he simply didn’t have the vocabulary. Just you try, dearreader, to describe a helicopter or a radio to a Stone Age man. You inevitablyend up in some kind of “it-looks-like-this” game. Or try explaining a spiralstaircase to somebody without using any pictures. You’ll need to use yourhands—at the very least!And this mess gets even worse with every new generation that attempts tounderstand and interpret the Enoch text and—of course!—completely fails tounderstand what is being described. Incapable of understanding that what theyread, later scribes delved into the fantasy of their oriental metaphors and thusarose opulent allegorical stories. Later, as the theologians of the last 200years began to interpret the texts from a religious perspective, the chaos wasfinally perfect. Finally, perfectly ordinary space travelers became angels andcherubim, officers became archangels, and the supreme commander became the “MostHigh” or, even worse, God. What pandemonium, when a simple electrical dischargeis transformed into “a tongue of fire,” and the command bridge becomes “theindescribable glory.” It’s understandable that, from a theological point ofview, the captain’s chair of command is transformed into a mighty throne and theincomprehensible mishmash of similitudes is turned into stories and visions.I have never heard a convincing counterargument, despite all the fabulousdiscussions I have had with Old Testament experts, and the absolute torrent oftheological literature that I have tried to digest. My interpretations of thetext must be false: maybe I should look at it from another angle. But why? Afterall, alternative explanations—not least those that have arisen fromexegesis—have only yielded nonsense and the core statements in the text arereflected in so many texts from outside of the Judaeo-Christian tradition.The first five chapters of the Book of Enoch announce (allegedly) some kind ofLast Judgment: the God of Heaven will leave his abode and descend to Earth withhis legions of Angels. The following eleven chapters describe what happens tothe so-called “apostate angels” who—in direct contravention to God’scommandments—“defiled” themselves with the daughters of men. These “angels” weregiven tasks by their “God” that were so precise that they just don’t fit in withthe cohorts of the heavenly host. For example:“Semjaza taught enchantments, and root cuttings, Armaros the resolving ofenchantments, Baraqijal taught astrology, Kokabel the constellations, Ezeqeelthe knowledge of the clouds, Araqiel the signs of the earth, Shamsiel the signsof the sun, and Sariel the course of the moon….”56 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not56]This is a range of specialized subjects that were way beyond the ken of earthlydwellers at that time.Chapters 17–36 describe Enoch’s journeys to the various worlds and distantspheres. Theologians call these similitudes or parables, or Enoch’s journey tothe magical garden (The Garden of Righteousness). Yet Enoch was ordered to writedown these so-called “similitudes” to preserve them for future generations. Whatwas the reason for this? Simple: his contemporaries were just not capable ofunderstanding these messages; they were intended for future folk. And that’s notmy interpretation; that’s from the book itself!Chapters 72–82 are known as the “astronomy chapters.” This is where Enochreceives instruction about the orbits of the sun and the moon, about leap years,about the stars and celestial mechanics. The remaining chapters containconversations with his son Methuselah, in which he announces the coming flood.The whole thing is crowned by Enoch’s departure in a flaming chariot—what else?The Slavonic Book of Enoch contains interesting details that are not to be foundin such detail in the Abyssinian version:After this too I lived two hundred years and completed of all the years of mylife three hundred and sixty five years. On the first day of the first month Iwas in my house alone…there appeared to me two men of enormous size, the like ofwhich I never saw on earth. Their faces were like the sun, their eyes too werelike a burning light, and from their lips came coming fire; their clothing andsong were splendid; their wings were brighter than gold, their hands whiter thansnow. They were standing at the head of my couch and called me by my name. Iarose from my sleep and saw clearly those two men standing in front of me. Isaluted them and was seized with fear and the appearance of my face was changedfrom terror, and those men said to me: “Have courage, Enoch, do not fear; theeternal God sent us to thee, and lo! today thou shalt ascend with us intoheaven, and thou shalt tell thy sons and all thy household all that they shalldo without thee on earth in thy house, and let no one seek thee till the Lordreturn thee to them.”57 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not57]The theological interpretation that the antediluvian patriarch is experiencing avision or a dream here is not tenable. Enoch awakes, gets up from his bed, andthen proceeds to give his kinsfolk instructions as to what they are to do in hisabsence. The “death vision” variation also makes no sense, as Enoch returns tohis family after his trip to outer space. So, what did he experience “up there”?ENOCH LEARNS THE SECRETS OF THE UNIVERSEEnoch learned to write, and books were dictated to him. Not, of course, that Godhimself dictated the knowledge personally. This was carried out by an archangelcalled Pravuil. And to make sure everything ran quickly and smoothly, Pravuilgave Enoch “a reed of quick-writing”:And the Lord summoned one of his archangels by the name of Pravuil, whoseknowledge was quicker in wisdom than the other archangels, who wrote all thedeeds of the Lord; and the Lord said to Pravuil: “Bring out the books from mystorehouses, and take a reed of quick-writing, and give it to Enoch, and deliverto him the choice and comforting books out of thy hand….”58[part0008.xhtml#ch01not58] [author’s italics]What was this important wisdom that had to be dictated? Actually, everything,because mankind down below knew very little. Enoch continued: “And it was toldme all the works of heaven, earth and sea, and all the elements their passagesand goings, and the thunderings of the thunders, the sun and moon, the goingsand changes of the stars, the seasons, years, days, and hours, the risings ofthe wind…and for thirty days and thirty nights he spake, never stopping.”59[part0008.xhtml#ch01not59]And, as if that wasn’t enough, the first marathon sitting was followed byanother, equally long dictation. Enoch was truly a model student.Whenever the conversation turns to Enoch and I suggest that the antediluvianprophet was privileged to have taken a course in a spaceship crewed byextraterrestrials, I always hear, Well, he must have had some sort of spacesuit.Must he? More likely, the aliens would have had to protect themselves againstbacteria and viruses and probably even human perspiration. What does theattentive student Enoch have to say?And the Lord said to Michael: “Go and take Enoch from out his earthly garments,and anoint him with my sweet ointment, and put him into the garments of Myglory.” And Michael did thus, as the Lord told him. He anointed me, and dressedme, and the appearance of that ointment is more than the great light, and hisointment is like sweet dew, and its smell as myrrh, shining like the sun’s rays,and I looked at myself, and was like one of his glorious ones.60[part0008.xhtml#ch01not60]Now try to imagine that this entire description has got something to do with the“dear Lord” of the Christian religion. He had a special salve and gave the orderto rub down Enoch with this intensely aromatic paste? We humans always hadpeculiar tastes! And then, Enoch was unclothed and then redressed in some kindof outfit that left him looking just like all the others. Of course! In aspacesuit, or at least a uniform: what else? And after finally being brought tothe bridge, or perhaps some sort of conference room—or, as the theologians seeit, before the “throne of the Great Glory”—Enoch told how the majestic leaderarose and “came to me and spoke to me with his voice.”61[part0008.xhtml#ch01not61]Here, at the very latest is where it gets embarrassing for the exegetes. It’snot really a scene that you can ascribe to God. Two extraterrestrials (“the likeof which I never saw on earth”) collected Enoch, disinfected him, dressed him ina spacesuit, and brought him to the command bridge of the mother ship, and Godwelcomed him “with his voice.” He then gave instructions that Enoch was to begiving a “reed of quick-writing” and then a subaltern named Pravuilwas given thetask of dictating scientific books to him for days on end. Is it any greatsurprise that the interpreters of sacred lore decided that Enoch’s reminiscencesmust have been some kind of “parable” or “vision”? But we’re not living in theDark Ages anymore. How many more arguments does it need to bring thesebackwoodsmen out of their woods? And bear in mind that everything that I, thediligent chronicler of today, am typing into my computer right now is nothingnew; it’s thousands of years old! Just forgotten, twisted, misinterpreted, andrepressed. It’s about time that the old texts were presented in a modern,comprehensible form to make it possible to plumb their meanings. May doubtshatter the old authorities, and reason triumph over faith.From scientific circles we learn that research must first concentrate on themost easily reachable and plausible explanations before reaching for more exoticsolutions. In that case, what is the closest, most sensible solution whenlooking at the Enoch texts? To be sure, it’s not what we have gotten fromprevious exegesis. Those interpretations make no sense because they are based onGod and his archangels and angels as some kind of executive body. Then thisalmighty creator of the universe is credited with deeds that would be absolutelybeneath a true god. The simplest means of extracting the real sense of the textis to look at it from a contemporary standpoint. And that is indeed theintention of the “lord” who ordered the dictation of the books: “And he saidunto me: ‘Observe, Enoch, these heavenly tablets, read what is written thereon,and mark you well every single fact.’ And I observed the heavenly tablets, andread everything which was written thereon and understood everything, and readthe book….” (Chapter 81, 1 ff)62 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not62]Before his final journey into the heavens, this same Enoch, writer of the Lord’sword, passed these books on to his son: “Preserve, my son Methuselah, the booksthou hast received from thy father’s hand, and deliver them to the generationsof the world….”63 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not63]If it turns out that the Egyptians are indeed right, and Enoch is the sameperson as Saurid, the pyramid builder, then there could well be some prettyamazing surprises lying in wait for us within the Great Pyramid. After all,Al-Maqrizi stressed in the Khitat that texts were placed in the pyramids “toprotect them and preserve them.”64 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not64] Science is basedon the creation of knowledge. As far as the Great Pyramid of Giza is concerned,science has practiced exactly the opposite. The Egyptologists of the presentday—at least the Arabs among them—should read the texts of their forefathers,too. One can read in the Khitat that Saurid (alias Enoch) had decorated theinterior of the eastern pyramid (allegedly the Cheops Pyramid) with “the variouscanopies of the skies and the planets,”65 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not65] in additionto “books about the stars. Also the fixed stars and that which betakes to happenfrom time to time…as well as the events of the past….”66[part0008.xhtml#ch01not66]None of this is known to the Egyptologists. The Cheops Pyramid is totallyanonymous—not one single glyph remains on its walls. But wait! In the GrandGallery, the grandiose entrance hall to the “King’s Chamber,” there are largemetal brackets that are mentioned nowhere in the scholarly literature. It couldwell be that these brackets were once holders for gold panels and that, inancient times, the Grand Gallery was a fantastic stairway to the “King’sChamber,” flanked left and right with the tidings from the past. Bands of graverobbers may well have taken these panels and melted them down. Yet there areother possibilities. As is now fairly widely known, within and beneath theso-called Cheops Pyramid lie various shafts and rooms.67[part0008.xhtml#ch01not67],68 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not68] But despite this, theholier-than-thou antiquities administration in Cairo wants none of this to bemade public.THE FALLEN ANĢELSThe real drama in the Book of Enoch, however, takes place between the ship’scaptain—“the Most High” in the religious interpretation—and his crew—the “fallenangels.” This group of beings does the one thing that angels never could:And it came to pass when the children of men had multiplied, that in those dayswere born unto them beautiful and comely daughters. But when the angels, thechildren of the heaven, saw them they lusted after them, and said to oneanother: “Come, let us choose us wives from among the children of men and begetus children.” And Semjaza, who was their leader, said unto them: “I fear ye willnot indeed agree to do this deed, and I alone shall have to pay the penalty of agreat sin.” And they all answered him and said: “Let us all swear an oath, andall bind ourselves by mutual imprecations not to abandon this plan but to dothis thing.” Then they all swore together and bound themselves by mutualimprecations upon it. And they were in number two hundred, who descended in thedays of Jared upon the summit of Mount Hermon.(Chapter 6, 1–6)69 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not69]And you need some kind of major theological song and dance to explain that? Thefacts are presented plainly enough: a crew of two hundred “sons of heaven” landon Mont Hermon, find themselves surrounded by beautiful earthly maidens, anddecide they want to do what comes naturally. But because this forbidden, theymake a pact that they will all see it through and will not let anything keepthem from their aims. Sex between people and extraterrestrials has been dealtwith before in other articles.70 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not70] And there is also,of course, the case of the angel named Samael who seduced the mother of man,Eve: “…and lo he looked not as the earthly, but rather as the heavenly.”71[part0008.xhtml#ch01not71] Other crew members tucked into the delicious earthlymaidens—and even lads—with gusto. To the horror of the Bible believers, it iseven reported in the Book of Books:“When men began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born tothem, the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful, and theymarried any of them they chose.”72 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not72]You can read it for yourself in the first Book of Moses—Genesis, chapter 6,verses 1 and 2.As long as theology has been around as a science, there has been a fierce debateabout what the phrase “sons of God” actually means, and the resulting thousandsof pages of commentaries on the subject are highly contradictory. One school ofthought claims that it means “giants,” whereas others are equally convinced thatit means “God’s children,” “fallen angels,” “apostate spirits.” It’s enough tomake you scream! One simple Bible phrase turns faith on its head! But actually,anyone who has studied Hebrew and knows the characters of the alphabet and theirmeaning knows exactly what these syllables express: “Those who fell from the sky[were] manlike beings of great size.”73 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not73]I can only manage a resigned smile for this academic feud. After all, howeveryou interpret this biblical passage, something’s going to come out wrong. If youtake “sons of God” literally, then it means that God must have had children—andall that in the age of Adam! And they had sex with the daughters of men. It’sunthinkable! If the phrase means “fallen angels,” there must have been some kindof conflict in Heaven. What? In God’s heavenly presence? But there must havebeen some kind of a blowup, or there wouldn’t be any “fallen angels.” There’sonly one really sensible way of understanding what was meant: extraterrestrials.Basta! And it becomes even clearer when Enoch lists the names of theringleaders: “And these are the names of their leaders: Semjaza, their leader,Araklba, Rameel, Kokablel, Tamlel, Ramlel, Danel, Ezeqeel, Baraqijal, Asael,Armaros, Batarel, Ananel, Zaqiel, Samsapeel, Satarel, Turel, Jomjael, Sariel.”(Chapter 6, verses 7 and 8. Note: The names in this list vary according to whichversion of the text you read.)74 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not74]And this group of beings doesn’t sit around when they get here. Enoch describestheir deeds:And Asael taught men to make swords, and knives, and shields, and breastplates,and made known to them the metals of the earth and the art of working them, andbracelets, and ornaments, and the use of antimony, and the beautifying of theeyelids, and all kinds of costly stones, and all coloring tinctures…Semjazataught enchantments, and root cuttings…Baraqijal taught astrology, Kokabel theconstellations, Ezeqeel the knowledge of the clouds, Araqiel the signs of theearth, Shamsiel the signs of the sun, and Sariel the course of the moon….”(Chapter 8)75 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not75]The list of names is not complete: there were 200 “fallen angels” in all whodescended onto Mount Hermon all those thousands of years ago. So what about allthe others? Enoch does provide us with another list; after all, he could writeand he understood their language. The strangers themselves had taught him. SoEnoch took on the role of interpreter between the ETs and his own folk.And these are their names:The first of them is Semjaza,the second Artaqifa,and the third Armen,the fourth Kokabel,the fifth Turael,the sixth Rumjal,the seventh Danjal,the eighth Neqael,the ninth Baraqijal,the tenth Azazel,the eleventh Armaros,the twelfth Batarjal,the thirteenth Busasejal,the fourteenth Hananel,the fifteenth Turel,and the sixteenth Simapesiel,the seventeenth Jetrel,the eighteenth Tumael,the nineteenth Turel,the twentieth Rumael,the twenty-first Azazael.76 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not76]And these are the names of their chief ones over hundreds, fifties, and tens:The name of the first Jeqon: who was the one who led astray [all] the sons ofGod, and brought them down to the earth, and led them astray through thedaughters of men. And the second was named Asbeel: he imparted to the holy sonsof God evil counsel, and led them astray so that they defiled their bodies withthe daughters of men. And the third was named Gadreel: he it is who showed thechildren of men all the blows of death, and he led astray Eve, and showed theweapons of death to the sons of men: the shield and the coat of mail, and thesword for battle, and all the weapons of death to the children of men. And fromhis hand they have proceeded against those who dwell on the earth from that dayand for evermore. And the fourth was named Penemue: he taught the children ofmen the bitter and the sweet, and he taught them all the secrets of theirwisdom. And he also instructed mankind in writing with ink and paper…. [author’sitalics](Chapter 69, 2 ff)77 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not77]This passage says it all—we can all read it. But the problem with our society isthat most people are too lazy to think; it’s too much for them; they are soexhausted that they need people to think for them so that they can work theirway up in life.UP TO NO GOODEnoch’s list not only gives us the names of those renegade angels who “descendedto Mount Hermon”—this sounds to me very much like a mutinous crew—it alsoprovides us with several of the professions of these “watchers of heaven,” asthey are called in one passage. Jeqon is revealed to be some kind of ringleaderwho convinces his colleagues to have sex with the fair earthly maidens. Asbeelhelps him. Gadreel and, in the earlier list, Asael seemed to be warlikemetallurgists who first show man how to smelt metal and then how to manufacturebreastplates, shields, and battle swords—which begs the question, of course:where were the enemies that needed fighting with these weapons? Penemue, theteacher of the crew, taught not only writing with pen and ink, he alsoinstructed mankind on the finesses of nutrition. Baraqijal turned out to be anastronomer; Kokabal was an astrologer—a science that means little to us thesedays; Ezeqeel was a meteorologist (“the knowledge of the clouds”); Araqiel was ageologist; and so on. From my contemporary viewpoint, it seems like a part ofthe crew rebelled against the “Most High,” the “Great Glory” (the starshipcommander), and they knew full well that there was no going back. So they didtheir best to survive on Earth and teach the Stone Age Earthlings how to makeweapons and other useful objects that they hadn’t known previously. Thisscenario is not mine: it’s exactly how Enoch describes it.After the 200 “watchers of heaven” came down and satisfied their sexual lusts onEarth, they suddenly started getting nervous that the captain would blow histop. So they sent Enoch up to the mother ship, hoping that, as an Earthling, hecould put in a good word or two for them:[They] lifted me upward, and bore me into heaven. And I went in till I drew nighto a wall built of crystals and surrounded by tongues of fire: and it began toscare me. And I went into the tongues of fire and approached a large house whichwas built of crystals. The walls of the house were like a tiled floor made ofcrystals, and its foundation was also of crystal. Its ceiling was like the pathof the stars and the lightnings, and between them were fiery cherubim, and theirheaven was as water. A flaming fire surrounded the walls, and its portals blazedwith fire…. There was a second house, greater than the former, and all its doorsstood open before me, and it was built of flames of fire. And in every respectit so excelled in splendor and magnificence and extent that I cannot describe toyou its splendor and its extent. And its floor was of fire, and above it werelightnings and the path of the stars, and its ceiling also was blazing fire. AndI looked and saw therein a lofty throne: its appearance was as crystal, and thewheels thereof as the shining sun…. And the Great Glory sat thereon, and Hisraiment shone more brightly than the sun and was whiter than any snow.(Chapter 14, 9–21)78 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not78]AN ARBITRARY CHRONOLOĢYCritics may well point out here that I haven’t actually quoted these passagesfrom the Book of Enoch in the “right” order and am thus deliberately distortingthe chronology of events. Well, I beg your pardon! The ordering of the chaptersby the experts of previous ages was random in itself. No one was in a positionto say with any great certainty in what order the various parchments and scrollswere meant to be read. They set to their task with great enthusiasm, trying tomake order out of chaos based on their idea of what the text was trying to say.As translator Dr. Emil Kautzsch noted in 1900, the text is “not from a singlesource.”79 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not79] And because not one single expert frommore than a century ago was capable of really identifying what it was reallyabout, Dr. Kautzsch also asked himself: “What have these broadly spun theories[from Enoch] about the sun, moon, stars, winds and similar subjects got to dowith the messianic judgment?”80 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not80] Every Enochtranslator, without exception, has had to deal with exactly the same dilemma.The order of the texts has never been fully understood. On the one hand, this isbecause new extracts were always being added that upset the chronology and, onthe other, because words and expressions could be interpreted in wildlydiffering ways. Only the Slavonic Book of Enoch exists in three differentvariants: the long, medium, and short recensions. In the longer edit, expertshave no difficulty in identifying the different handwriting styles of fivedifferent scribes using Middle-Bulgarian orthography. One South Russianhandwriting style can even be pinpointed to the city of its origin: “written inthe city of Poltava in the imperial church of the resurrection of our Lord Godand Savior Jesus Christ…in the monastery of the Ascension of our Lord.”81[part0008.xhtml#ch01not81] Alongside this, there are Serbian and Russian Enochtexts, one consisting of 189 folios and the other of 362. Like the so-calledurtexts of the gospels of the New Testament, these versions of Enoch have beenedited from time to time. The abbots and monks believed that these booksreferred to the messiah, redemptions, the final judgment, and the second comingof the Messiah, not to mention the divine judgment of the apocalypse (asmentioned in the “Revelations” of the New Testament). Logically, passages fromthe original text that made no sense were adapted to fit the thinking of theday. What chaos! In this way, parts of the “longer version” translated by Dr.Nathanael Bonwetsch turned out differently to the Greek or Slavonic variants.For instance, in this description of the descent of the “watchers of heaven” 82[part0008.xhtml#ch01not82]: “…they went down on to earth from the Lord’s throne,to the place Ermon, and broke through their vows on the shoulder of the hillErmon and saw the daughters of men how good they are, and took to themselveswives, and befouled the earth with their deeds….” (Chapter XVII)83[part0008.xhtml#ch01not83]The logic of the respectable analysts of the last 200 years simply doesn’t addup. Their ideas, which still guide thinking even today, were wrong from the verybeginning. Any other possible interpretations were suffocated at the start by atightly tied religious corset that gave them no room to breathe. Lines weredrawn that were not to be crossed. And, as far as our contemporaryinterpretation is concerned, perhaps we are being a bit unfair to our forebears,who could hardly have been expected to know of interstellar travel. Thiscontemporary viewpoint changes the entire meaning of Enoch—and not just Enoch!The consequences could be highly disquieting, for the very existence ofextraterrestrials generally, let alone thousands of years ago, forces us to drawconclusions that blow our current view of things to pieces. And I’m not sayingthis from arrogance or even as a joke. There’s simply no way around it: we haveto re-interpret the texts that we have received from our ancestors from a modernviewpoint. There are too many of them to ignore. They are scattered everywherearound the world, and more will come from the ruins and the temples (you, mydear reader, will find out more in the next chapter), such as the Voynichmanuscript. We are marching in a straight line directly into the age of wondersand awakening. Human history is not over yet—not by a long way.A VOYAĢE INTO THE HEAVENSEnoch experiences, as do Abraham, Ezekiel, Arjuna, and Enkidu in otherhistories, a journey into space—a journey that he is simply not equipped tocomprehend. And his astonishment does not abate. He knows nothing of thematerials used to construct the spaceship. So for him, the heat-resistant tilesof the hull are bright crystals, and the reinforced glass and holographicdisplays are a “ceiling like the path of the stars.”84[part0008.xhtml#ch01not84] Awestruck and afraid, he is led to see the captain:“the Great Glory sat [on his throne], and His raiment shone more brightly thanthe sun and was whiter than any snow.”85 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not85] And whatdoes this glorious deity do? He greets Enoch and makes it clear that the “fallenangels”—the mutineers—can expect nothing more from him:Fear not, Enoch, thou righteous man and scribe of righteousness. Approach hitherand hear my voice. And go, say to the watchers of heaven, who have sent thee tointercede for them: “You should intercede” for men, and not men for you:Wherefore have ye left the high, holy, and eternal heaven, and lain with women,and defiled yourselves with the daughters of men and taken to yourselves wives,and done like the children of earth…? (Chapter 15, 1–4)86[part0008.xhtml#ch01not86]The “Great Glory” also knows how he is going to deal with his mutinous crew andtheir offspring: a terrible flood over all the Earth. “Yea, there shall come agreat destruction over the whole earth, and there shall be a deluge…and thereshall be a great punishment on the earth, and the earth shall be cleansed fromall impurity.” (Chapter 106, 13 ff)87 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not87] In the longerrecension, this passage goes into more detail: “And for that reason, I shallbring down a flood on the Earth, and the Earth itself will be destroyed and sinkinto mud.”88 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not88]Having said that, the “Great Glory” takes steps to ensure that a select fewsurvive, so that, over the course of the millennia, the human population will bein a position to recover—until his return. In the long recension of the SlavonicBook of Enoch, the “Great Glory” speaks of a “second coming.” Interestingly, thesurvivors of the flood carry a changed genetic structure. This can clearly bededuced from the ancient writings, and I’ve written about it extensively in myother books.89 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not89], 90 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not90] (Andthe clever geneticists will be able to see for themselves!)Is it even permissible to deduce a single Enoch from this confusion of Enochtexts, and then on top of that to—arbitrarily?—filter out those passages thatfit in with a modern interpretation? Just to remind you: Enoch himself stresseshis authorship many times as Methuselah’s father. Then knowledge is dictated tohim that simply cannot be ascribed to any antediluvian society:“And I saw other lightnings and the stars of heaven…. And I saw how they areweighed in a righteous balance, according to their proportions of light, thewidth of their spaces and the day of their appearing. [author’s italics](Chapter43, 1–2) 91 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not91]How do today’s astronomers classify the stars? They also have a classificationsystem that is based on magnitude (“weighed in a righteous balance”), brightness(“according to their proportions of light”), relative position (“the width oftheir spaces”), as well as the date of their discovery (“the day of theirappearing”). The antediluvian Enoch must have received such sound informationfrom his source that was way ahead of his times. These strange instructors—inthe Book of Enoch they are named as Uriel and Pravuil— dictate and demonstrateastronomical and meteorological knowledge of great sophistication to thedumbstruck Enoch. To us it might seem like pretty everyday stuff, but not tosomeone in Enoch’s time:And there mine eyes saw the secrets of the lightning and of the thunder, and thesecrets of the winds, how they are divided to blow over the earth, and thesecrets of the clouds and dew…. And I saw the chambers of the sun and moon,whence they proceed and whither they come again, and their glorious return, andhow one is superior to the other, and their stately orbit, and how they do notleave their orbit, and they add nothing to their orbit and they take nothingfrom it…. And after that I saw the hidden and the visible path of the moon, andhow she accomplishes the course of her path in that place by day and by night….(Chapter 41, 3 ff) And after that all the secrets of the lights and lightningswere shown to me, and they lighten for blessing and for satisfying the Earth….(Chapter 59, 3) For the thunder has places of rest assigned to it while it iswaiting for its peal; and the thunder and lightning are inseparable, andalthough not one and undivided, they both go together through the spirit andseparate not. For when the lightning lightens, the thunder utters its voice….”(Chapter 61, 14–15)92 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not92]Enoch learns things that we didn’t learn until thousands of years later througharduous research. He writes of the “hidden path of the moon” and laws regardingthunder and lightning which are truly hard to credit to a stone-age society. Theangel Uriel teaches him about a “treasury of lights and thunder” (Chapter 17,3)93 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not93], which is pretty hard for Enoch to grasp. Afterall, the mere concept of a “treasury of thunder” is not something that justcomes to you while riding on the back of a camel. In an orbiting space station,on the other hand, astronauts view the “treasury of thunder” on a daily basis.It is the gigantic reservoir of electrical charge that builds up in thevariously charged levels of cloud and comes down from the storm to the Earthlike “columns of heavenly fire” (Enoch again).INTERĢALACTIC ASTRONOMY LESSONSEnoch’s instruction includes the sun, the moon, the leap years, and the paths ofthe stars in relation to the Earth’s rotation. Wow! Seeing as books about Enochcannot generally be found in most bookstores and the Internet has little morethan superficial commentaries that don’t add anything to our understanding, Ican offer little more than a few quotes from Charles’s more-than-100-year-oldtranslation:The book of the courses of the luminaries of the heaven, the relations of each,according to their classes, their dominion and their seasons, according to theirnames and places of origin, and according to their months, which Uriel, the holyangel, who was with me, who is their guide, showed me…. And first there goesforth the great luminary, named the Sun, and his circumference is like thecircumference of the heaven, and he is quite filled with illuminating andheating fire…and the sun goes down from the heaven and returns through the northin order to reach the east…. When the sun rises in the heaven, he comes forththrough that fourth portal thirty, mornings in succession, and sets accuratelyin the fourth portal in the west of the heaven. And during this period the daybecomes daily longer and the night nightly shorter….(Chapter 72, 1 ff)94 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not94]And it goes on in the same vein: the sun travels through these imaginary“portals,” and the days get longer and the nights get shorter until “[o]n thatday the day is equalized with the night, and the night amounts to nine parts andthe day to nine parts.” (Chapter 72, 20–21)95 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not95]Anyone can see that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. But thesesunrises and sunsets don’t always take place at exactly the same locations. Thepoint at which the sun rises and sets shifts every day within a set of fixedboundaries, which are dependent on the point of observation. On the first daysof spring (March 21st) and fall (September 23rd) the sun rises exactly in theeast and sets exactly in the west. On every other day the sunrise and sunset area little offset from these points. These are Enoch’s “portals,” in which the suntravels. Until the displacement is again canceled out, as Enoch confirms: “Andthe sun has therewith traversed the divisions of his orbit and turns again onthose divisions of his orbit.” (Chapter 72, 27)96 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not96]I believe in evolution—with certain reservations—and swallowed my Enoch with theappropriate amount of healthy skepticism. It is simply impossible that modernknowledge crops up in ancient books and our “super-clever” philologists,theologians, and exegetes make “visions” or “Enoch’s magic garden” out of it.Sometimes I feel like I’m in some kind of weird ballet. Nymphs are dancing allaround me on tiptoe, accompanied by effeminate men in flowing robes, and theyare all weaving a picture of a fantastic world that doesn’t even exist. Do noneof these people have any imagination? Or are they just incapable of throwing offthe ballast of the previous generations? I tend to describe myself as aimaginative realist, but I don’t let my imagination run away with me. Theboundaries between today’s realists—the scientists—and my way of looking atthings are not fixed. It’s just that the scientist turns away as soon as realitytakes on a fantastic form. For us today, Enoch’s reality is still prettyfantastic—as it was indeed for Enoch himself. I remember a scientist once sayingto me after a talk show about aliens that we had both participated in: “Thesearen’t the sort of things that we should be worrying about! We should be lookingat our own current problems!” He didn’t want to believe that the past had astrong influence on our present. If ETs really did visit our planet millenniaago and passed on their knowledge to someone like Enoch, that’s got plenty to dowith right now. Just think, my dear reader, about the impact on religion, thephilosophical consequences, the possibilities for space flight technology thatcan cross light years, or think about the ancient promise of a second comingthat crops up in practically every religion to this present day. Obviously,there are two types of hypotheses: the embarrassing ones and the rest. Enoch’sinstructors—call them “angels” if you like, although it doesn’t really fit thepicture—knew perfectly well why they were teaching their pupil:The smaller luminary, which is named the Moon…her rising and setting changeevery month: and her days are like the days of the sun, and when her light isuniform [i.e. full] it amounts to the seventh part of the light of the sun. Andthus she rises. And her first phase in the east comes forth on the thirtiethmorning: and on that day she becomes visible, and constitutes for you the firstphase of the moon…. And the one half of her goes forth by a seventh part, andher whole circumference is empty, without light, with the exception ofone-seventh part of it, and the fourteenth part of her light…. And all theseUriel, the holy angel who is the leader of them all, showed to me, and theirpositions, and I wrote down their positions as he showed them to me…. In singleseventh parts she accomplishes all her light in the east, and in single seventhparts accomplishes all her darkness in the west….(Chapters 73–74)97 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not97]In the modern publication Handbook of Space, you can read exactly the samething:The point at which the moon crosses the plane of the ecliptic from south tonorth is called the rising node, the other is called the falling node…. The moststriking thing about the moon’s appearance is its phases. As the moon itself hasno source of luminescence, but rather simply reflects the light of the sun, thephases of the moon are dependent on the relative positions of these two heavenlybodies….98 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not98]This just paraphrases the information that we hear from Enoch, only he speaks of“portals” in which the sun and the moon move. He also describes the phases ofthe moon, and he knows that the Earth’s satellite receives its light from thesun. Statements such as these presuppose two things: that the observer realizesnot only that the Earth is a sphere, but also that it follows an elliptic patharound the sun. Somehow that doesn’t fit in with my preconceptions of the stateof scientific thinking in the third century B.C., the period in which the Bookof Enoch was supposedly written. Johannes Keppler, Galileo Galilei, and SirIsaac Newton all came onto the scene a lot later. In Chapters 74 and 75, Enochprovides a description of the leap days:And if five years are added together the sun has a surplus of thirty days, andall the days which accrue to it for one of those five years, when they are full,amount to 364 days…. And the leaders…have also to do with the four intercalarydays, being inseparable from their office, according to the reckoning of theyear, and these render service on the four days which are not reckoned in thereckoning of the year…. For the signs and the times and the years and the daysthe angel Uriel showed to me…. And I saw chariots in the heaven, running in theworld, above those portals in which revolve the stars that never set. And one islarger than all the rest, and it is that that makes its course through theentire world. [author’s italics]99 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not99]ECHOES FROM INDIAWhen I read that Enoch has seen “chariots in the heaven, running in the world,above those portals in which revolve the stars that never set,” then my thoughtsare drawn to ancient India. Take a look at this:Indra’s car, endued with great effulgence and driven by Matali, came dividingthe clouds and illuminating the firmament, filling the entire sky with its roar.It was a heavenly creation, blinding to behold. Arjuna—blazing like theSun—himself ascended the celestial car…. As he approached that realm invisibleto the mortals of the Earth, he beheld thousands of cars of extraordinarybeauty. And in that region there was no sun or moon or fire to give light…. Andthose brilliant regions that are seen from the Earth in the form of stars, likelamps, are great heavenly bodies….100 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not100]It simply does not make sense to analyze Enoch’s tales in isolation, or to viewthem solely in terms of their relation to other semi-religious, wishy-washytexts belonging to the Judaeo-Christian faith, and just sweep the rest under thecarpet! But there’s light at the end of the tunnel—even if it’s light comingfrom thousands of years in the past. The state of our knowledge today is not thepeak of wisdom, and mankind is not the pinnacle of evolution. Our stubbornbelief in the findings of scientists is only justifiable in areas where scienceis an exact art. All deductions based on collected wisdom, however, must betreated with caution and questioned as soon as new information comes to light.The information provided by these ancient texts is neither reverie nor wishfulthinking; it is there, and it will confound and astonish our Internet-surfingsociety into more chaos than even the invention of the radio.Even today, we live in a kind of puzzling dream world: the TV screen is like amagic mirror that brings us pictures of military maneuvers in Iraq, politicalevents from Peru, or expeditions to the South Pole—all delivered to our livingrooms at the touch of a button. We experience the assassination of a U.S.president and then, just a short time later, we see the same man—risen from thedead it seems—talking and smiling at us from the flickering screen. We watchscience programs showing discoveries made under the microscope, and we neverknow what is truth and what is simply propaganda. We gape at rocket launches andstare in wonder at the International Space Station that’s buzzing by somewhereover our heads, shining like a weak star. When the planet Earth finally shakesoff its infestation of human beings, heaven alone knows how our successors onthis world will describe the past. Just imagine, dear reader, that somecatastrophe were to hit the Earth—it doesn’t matter what. But somewhere, on thepeak of some isolated Swiss Alp, a ragged few have somehow survived. You canrest assured that they would do everything they could to ensure that the speciessurvived and start producing children as soon as possible. And one proud father,sitting with his son on his knee, would look up as an excessively large, mutatedmountain eagle soared by their cabin:“Look, son,” the father would say, pointing. “When I was younger there weremetal birds hundreds of times larger than that eagle. And people could sit inthe belly of the bird and look out of windows onto the Earth below. These mightybirds flew faster than an arrow over the great water to a place where houseswere built so high they reached up into the clouds….”The father grows old and dies, and the son himself becomes a father. Now, theyoung father retells the story for his young son:“Just imagine, my son. Your grandfather told me that there were once giant birdsin which people could sit and look down at the Earth beneath them. These birdsflew faster than any arrow and could even cross the mighty water to a placewhere the houses grew up into the clouds….”Already by the second generation, the story is unfeasible. So just try andimagine what happens when, many generations later, theologians try and analyzethese scenes from their religio-psychological standpoint. Holy Enoch help us!Today, you can find many texts from long-forgotten epochs, even if they’ve beenrewritten many times and adapted to meet the understanding of the age. Some ofthese texts have been intentionally transformed into ciphers, such as the JewishCabbala, so that only a selected circle of the initiated can understand theencrypted contents. Other, like the Popol Vuh or the Mayan inscriptions—thereare three versions!—only remain in small excerpts, and even then probably poorlytranslated at that. And then there are those, such as the Voynich manuscript,that defy any attempt at all to reveal their contents. It’s hardly worthmentioning all of the hundreds of thousands of writings that have fallen victimto fire or intentional destruction over the centuries. But the Bible, theApocrypha, and good old Enoch’s book all really do exist, even if they are nolonger quite in their original forms. What do we make of them, we oh-so-clevermodern men and women? We transform an intentional genetic mutation, in otherwords a change in our genetic code, into a “miracle of birth.” You can find inchapters 106 and 107 of the Book of Enoch, or in the Lamech Scroll, one of thefamed “Dead Sea Scrolls.”101 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not101] And what do we clownsmake of it? The original motif for the “immaculate conception”! The highlyprecise descriptions by the prophet Ezekiel in the Bible are transformed into“visions, dreams, inspirations” and other such humbug, although he is clearlytalking about a shuttle craft. And we tinker around with the Book of Enoch,making it into some kind of incredible “magic garden.” Mad!A LEĢACY FOR FUTURE GENERATIONSThe story of the seventh antediluvian king, “who ascended into heaven” as thescrolls say, has been falsified, adapted, expanded, changed, rewritten, andreligiously interpreted, but the content is nevertheless still recognizable. Andbecause this “seventh” appears both in the Jewish Torah and the Old Testamentunder the name Enoch, this mixed bag of tales is collected together under theheading “the Books of Enoch.” Even though the writer may well have been namedsomething else entirely, I’m left with little option than to call him Enochmyself. This fellow was taught many branches of science by an alien race, and,to make things move along quicker, he learned to write using “a reed ofquick-writing.” After his heavenly crash course he was returned to his peoplewith an urgent task: to teach them and to pass on his books so that they wouldsurvive the ages:And two thousand men came together and came to the place Achuzan where Enoch waswith his sons. And the elders of the people, the whole assembly, came and boweddown and began to kiss Enoch and said to him: …the Lord chose thee rather thanall men on earth and designated thee writer of all his creation. (Chapter XLIV,4–5, longer recension)102 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not102]Where is this place “Achuzan” where Enoch gathers his people? The astronomicalinformation he provides give us a good basis for working it out. Before Enochreturns to “heaven”—or, in the modern version, to the mother ship to take thegrand tour of space—he expends a great deal of effort in telling his folk allthat has happened to him and to preserve his books for future generations:Enoch was born on the sixth day of the month Tsivan, and lived three hundred andsixty-five years. He was taken up to heaven on the first day of the month Tsivanand remained in heaven sixty days. He wrote all these signs of all creation,which the Lord created, and wrote three hundred and sixty-six books, and handedthem over to his sons and remained on earth thirty days, and was again taken upto heaven on the sixth day of the month Tsivan, on the very day and hour when hewas born…. Methuselah and his brethren, all the sons of Enoch, made haste, anderected an altar at the place called Achuzan, whence and where Enoch had beentaken up to heaven.” (Chapter LXVIII, longer recension)103[part0008.xhtml#ch01not103]And if there remain any doubts as to whether it really was the seventhantediluvian patriarch Enoch and whether it was really books that were beingtalked about:“…Mark well the words of your father, which are all come to you from the Lord’slips. Take these books of your father’s handwriting and read them….(Chapter XLVII, longer recension)104 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not104]“Enoch indeed wrote this complete doctrine of wisdom….”(Chapter 92, 1)105 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not105]“Another book which Enoch wrote for his son Methuselah and for those who willcome after him….”(Chapter 108, 1)106 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not106]“And after that Enoch both gave and began to recount from the books.”(Chapter 93, 1)107 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not107]“And now, my son Methuselah, call to me all thy brothers And gather together tome all the sons of thy mother….”(Chapter 91, 1)108 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not108]“And now, my son, I have shown thee everything, and the law of all the stars ofthe heaven is completed.”(Chapter 79, 1)109 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not109]“And Methuselah made haste, and summoned his brethren, Regim, Riman, Uchan,Chermion, Gaidad, and all the elders of the people before the face of his fatherEnoch….”(Chapter LVII, 2)110 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not110]And we mustn’t leave out his task for the future, because that includes us, too:“And now, my son Methuselah…. I have revealed to thee everything, and given theebooks concerning all these: so preserve, my son Methuselah, the books from thyfather’s hand, and see that thou deliver them to the generations of the world….”[author’s italics] (Chapter 82)111 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not111]Where are these books? The bundles of old parchments that make up the so-calledBooks of Enoch are certainly not what is meant. Sometime and somewhere thesemissing texts are going to turn up. This is what the “Great Glory”prophesies—and he ought to know:Behold from their seed shall arise another generation, much later, but of themmany will be very insatiate. He who raises that generation, shall reveal to themthe books of thy handwriting, of thy fathers, to them to whom he must point outthe guardianship of the world, to the faithful men and workers of my pleasure,who do not acknowledge my name in vain. And they shall tell another generation,and those others having read shall be glorified thereafter, more than thosebefore. [author’s italics] (Chapter XXXV)112 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not112]Fantastic, these pearls of wisdom from days of yore! The diagnosis is a fittingone. Texts, which are simply too complex for the people in Enoch’s times, willturn up thousands of years later, and those who read them will be “glorifiedthereafter, more than those before.” Someone like me, who tends to look a littlefurther back into the mists of time, might be of help in speeding along thistime of awakening. A big change is coming, and politicians, self-importantscientists, and unctuously blathering religious leaders may want to, but willnever be able to, stop it. There is no vaccination against thinking. Ideas knowno boundaries and no censorship. And what’s more, ideas have a dangeroustendency to spread like wildfire.THE MIRACLE OF MISINFORMATIONThe marvel of television is one means that is being used to try and turn societyinto a uniform mush. The manipulation and thought control inexorably continues.Mankind is being rinsed out into a group of dull moralists who convincethemselves that they are “good people.” Their view of the world is fabricated bythe mass media, and the bosses and chief editors of the electronic media arejust the henchmen for unnecessary “councils,” “advisory boards” of politicalcommissions, and “contingents,” who don’t miss a single chance to get involvedin things—regardless of whether or not they have a clue what they’re talkingabout. TV programs with opinions that contradict any religion—regardless ofwhich one—are not permitted. That’s what we’ve come to!Our unscientific nature, our faith in some rubbish or other, dominates ourlives. The massive flood of information out there has just made us sluggish.We’d rather vegetate in front of the TV than read a book with an attentive andcritical eye, rather laze on the beach in Hurghada than take a closer look atthe Great Pyramid. Today’s young people mess around with their computers; theirmonitors spew out data that interests no one and is therefore immediatelyconsigned to the trashcan of forgetfulness. What does it help us in thiselectronic age to have thousands of times the amount of information available ifnothing ever gets done with it? Yes, we surf through it, but we never reallydive in. The Internet manipulates us, because we believe that we can call upjust about anything we want and that makes us well-informed. IT = InformationTrickery. The Net only spits out what somebody somewhere else has typed in. Soyou’ll find it hard, dear reader, to find either apocryphal texts, or Manetho’slist of Egyptian kings, not to mention the complete translation of Mahabharataby Chandra Roy from 1888. Much of what we “know” about the Net is an illusion.We are fumbling around in the dark when we go looking for ancient texts that arenever likely to end up online. Giga: garbage in, garbage out. So there willnever be any cross-indexing. The omniscient Internet is one-sided and basicallyalready a manipulation of those who believe that they can rely on it, enteredfor the like-minded among the like-minded.Today’s “mouse potatoes” behave like all people who think along the same lines,from the very moment they sit down at the keyboard. Just like semiconsciouspatients all twitching in time with each other. It doesn’t even shock meanymore, because I know how the system works. There are no cross-linkagesoutside of the Net; they’re simply unknown. Thus a kind of psychosis of faithhas arisen—you could almost describe it as a culture of hangers-on—which hasbecome routine in our allegedly so-well-informed society. Connecting the pastwith the future is unthinkable for single-track minds. But the two arenevertheless utterly intertwined, and anyone who hasn’t figured that out yet hadbetter learn quickly, because the future is about to be overrun by the past. Howare we going to behave when Enoch’s alien friends actually return? And that theyare going to return is as sure as night follows day. For those who areinterested I recommend my book Der Götter-Schock ( The God Shock). Are we goingto suffer a god shock? The fact that our thinking is manipulated from the momentof our births is illustrated nicely (or nastily, if you prefer) in the followingexample that has stuck in my mind since hearing a lecture by Professor KarlSteinbuch some 40 years ago: In one country children are brought up to bechurchgoers; in another to be Muslims. And neither society considers that simplyswitching the babies can make an otherwise Christian child a Muslim, or viceversa. This simple insight demonstrates the fundamental nature of anyindoctrination.After Enoch learned the language of the extraterrestrials, having been taught by“angels,” and wrote everything down on parchment with his “a reed ofquick-writing,” and then spent 30 days relating the whole episode to his sonsand eldest, his new, “heavenly” friends come and fetch him for the grand tour.The people don’t understand what is going on:When Enoch had talked to the people, the Lord sent out darkness on to the earth,and there was darkness, and it covered those men standing with Enoch, and theytook Enoch up on to the highest heaven…. And the people who saw but understoodnot how Enoch bad been taken, glorified God, and all went to their homes.(Chapter LXVII, longer recension)113 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not113]ENOCH TAKES HIS LEAVEThe Ancient Legends of the Jews tell a somewhat longer version of Enoch’sdisappearance. The “angels,” they claim, had promised Enoch to take him withthem, but the departure had not been finally decided: “A call came to me that Iwould depart to heaven, yet I knew not on which day I would go from you.”114[part0008.xhtml#ch01not114] So Enoch and his people sit around, and he impartsto them all he has learned from the angels Uriel and Pravuil. In particular, hestresses to them that his books must not be kept secret, but must be retainedfor the future generations (something I approve of!). After a few days ofteaching, it starts getting exciting:And it occurred at the same time as the people and Enoch sat and Enoch spoke tothem. The people lifted up their eyes and saw the figure of a steed descend fromheaven, and the steed rode down on a storm to Earth. And the people told Enochwhat they saw: “This steed has come down for me. The time has come and the daythat I must go from among you and never see you again.” Then the steed was thereand all saw it clearly.115 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not115]Apparently Enoch had been forewarned by the ETs Uriel and Pravuil that thetakeoff would be dangerous for any bystanders, so he advised his followers towithdraw. He warned the curious onlookers many times not to follow him “so thatyou do not die.”116 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not116] Some of them understood, but themost obstinate spectators were desperate to witness Enoch’s “rapture” firsthand.It gets dramatic: “They spoke, we will follow you to the place from whence youdepart; only death can stand between us. And because they were stubborn he spokeno more with them and they followed him and did not turn back. And so ithappened: Enoch ascended in weather into the stormy heaven on fiery steeds in afiery chariot.”117 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not117]Enoch’s trip into the clouds ends fatally for his companions. On the followingday, a search party goes out to find those who had accompanied the master:And they sought at that place where Enoch had ascended to heaven and when theycame to the site they found the ground blanketed in snow and great stones wereas snow stones. They spoke to one another and said: Let us shovel away this snowto see if those who followed Enoch lie under it. And they shoveled away the snowand found those who had accompanied Enoch lying dead. They also sought Enoch,but they found him not, for he had ascended into heaven. This happened in onehundred thirteenth year of the life of Lamech, the son of Methuselah, as Enochascended into heaven.”118 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not118]This dramatic finale must have left even the exegetes somewhat perplexed, asthey have always interpreted Enoch’s “ascension” as simply his acceptance intothe bosom of God. Just imagine the dear, kindly God looks on indifferently ashundreds of innocent onlookers are burnt to a crisp while their teacher travelsup to heaven? They listened to their wise Enoch, they honored him, they hadattached themselves to him, and, finally, they fatally followed him to hislaunch site. What had these people really done wrong? Enoch departs “in weather”and “on fiery steeds in fiery chariots,” but back on the ground all are burnedalive—man and mouse—and even the stones are scorched white and are covered in afine white powder that resembles snow. These days, we know that certain rocks(for instance, limestone) turn white when exposed to extreme heat and thatsand—depending on the temperature—will fuse into glassy crystals that look likewhite salt. And our dear, loving God did that? And the theologians describe itall as Enochian “visions”? Didn’t God have the power to fetch his pupil in aless-destructive manner? Why the agonizing and dramatic immolation of so manypeople, who simply wanted to accompany their beloved master Enoch?TIME FOR A NEW TAKETheology, philology, philosophy—these are, after all, humanities, and yet it isprecisely these groups who accuse me and a few of my like-minded contemporariesof “warping” the texts to fit our theories. What kind of intellectual leaps doyou need to make something divine out of the “Most High” and the “Great Glory”in the Books of Enoch? Admittedly, I have a certain amount of understanding forsome of these old-school interpretations: after all, our honorable forefatherscouldn’t have been expected to have understood anything about interstellartravel and consequently comprehended, interpreted, and conserved the textswithin their own theological frame of reference. But conservation is the same aspreservation—and even the best preservatives can’t keep the food fresh forever.The Enoch texts and many other ancient documents are crying out for a morecontemporary interpretation. But, in our society, they immediately cry out inshock and horror: “impossible,” “flight of fancy,” or even “sacrilege”! Whenwill knowledge win through and people realize that the wheel of understanding isnot turned by the accountants—even if they’re academics—but by those who do notwant to shut out understanding? As early as 1946, the UNO declared that thefreedom of information was a fundamental human right. And all so-called “free”states have laws such as the “Freedom of Information Act,” as it is called inthe United States of America. The freedom to exchange information is one of themost valuable rights that we possess. Everyone should be free to say, write, andeven print their opinions, it stands to reason. Doesn’t it?Even in the democratic world, we have already regressed to the stage where booksare banned by law. A single person or a religious group—or even worse, apolitical ideology—feels hurt and is puffed up with indignation and, before youknow it, the book is on the banned list (sometimes before it’s even beenpublished!), as if the affected parties were not capable of suing for libel, andthe genuine or alleged cases of slander couldn’t be put together properly. Insome of the most extreme cases, this is at the cost of the author who trumpetedthese “libels” into the world. These days, we’ve reached a point where certainthings can no longer be said in public. They are impeded by politicalcorrectness or sanctimonious legislation that screams out for—can you believeit?—eavesdropping and spying to find out who said what. The judicially ledmanipulation, the Orwellian state, is being brought about a piece at a time bypolitical clowns who take themselves unutterably seriously. And the poor judges,who have to push through this nonsense, convince themselves that their judgmentscontribute to the peace of mind of society and that is a higher aim than anyconstitution. As a member of the international PEN Club, which is committed tothe freedom of speech and the written word, I am embarrassed to my ears aboutthese unholy laws that restrict our freedom and that even now exist in my homecountry of Switzerland. It’s amazing how far these political fools have come.In a theocracy, there is no freedom of information. Those who forbid the spokenand written word always have reason to fear it. Its own indoctrination stinks tohigh heaven! Society is “adapted”—the next phase is like this: by the left,quick march!I made the assertion that texts from extraterrestrials exist on the Earth andreferred to the following examples:The god Theuth gave the pharaoh writings in Naucratis.The so-called Book of Adam preserved in a sapphire.Oannes (in Babylon) gave the people a book.The divine being Yma from the holy book of the Parsees, theAvesta, presented writings. The same being was known to thePhoenicians as Taut:The Chinese emperor receives texts from a monster calledMeng-ho, a beast with “the body of a horse and the head of adragon.”The divine master Padmasambhava in Tibet bringsindecipherable writings down to Earth that are beingpreserved to this very day for the time when “they can beunderstood.”Diodorus of Sicily claims that a god taught man how to readand write.Enoch: “Observe, Enoch, these heavenly tablets, read what iswritten thereon….” Enoch is taught by angels and is given a“reed of quick-writing.” He passes on his books to his sonMethuselah.My list isn’t complete—thousands of authors from antiquity and scriptures fromvarious religions have claimed the same thing. So, what do we do with it? Justfairy stories, nonsense, rubbish, visions, imaginings, wishful thinking,raptures, magic gardens? Or are we the problem? Is it our way of looking atthings? Is it that we just can’t believe what is staring us in the face? Ourthinking is led by scholarly thinking from the moment we start in school.Evolution is the magic word. And the fact that evolution exists has been provenand is indisputable. With reservations. Not everything runs according to thehappy evolution principle. There have been targeted genetic mutations throughoutman’s history. That can at least be proven by ancient writings, and those whodon’t believe it simply don’t know the texts. There are “gods” and “teachers”that we can’t just spirit away on the grounds that they don’t fit into the boxmarked evolution—because they were here and they left their mark. And that canbe shown by anyone who knows the material; the others should take a look! Ourstiff-necked belief in evolution has force-fed us—one mouthful at a time—thebelief that one thing led to another and we human beings are at the top of theevolutionary pile. That is no more true than the religious claim that we are thepinnacle of creation. The wise academics of our age cling to the principle of“simple possibility,” the “most plausible solution.” This approach excludesevery other way of looking at things. They are trapped in a kind of thoughtprison, because once the “most plausible solution” has been found, that’s an endto it. What’s the point of looking any further? When applied to the mostfundamental problems, this methodology, even if it has been declared sacrosanctby the scientific community, only brings us half the answer—if that. And one ofthese null-solutions is the theory of evolution. Evolution is the answer to manythings—but not everything.PLATO SHEDS SOME LIĢHTPlato’s dialog Timaeus, for example, is not just about Atlantis, but also dealswith geometry and the creation of the Earth.119 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not119]After reading through Plato’s writings for a few weeks, I found it really hardto understand why Galileo Galilei was made to suffer because of his theories onheliocentricity and why he was almost killed by the Inquisition in the 17thcentury. Everything that Galileo taught was already there to read in Plato: forexample, the fact that the Earth is spherical or that it orbits around the sun.Gaius Plinius Secundus (23-79 A.D.), who also must have studied Plato andEuclid, puts it quite plainly:There is a great debate between the learned and the vulgar as to whether thereare men dispersed over every part of the earth, so that they stand with theirfeet turned towards each other…. If anyone should ask, why those situatedopposite to us do not fall, we directly ask in return, whether those on theopposite side do not wonder that we do not fall…. It is indeed wonderful that itshould form a globe, when there is so much flat surface of the sea and of theplains…thus it is never night and day at the same time over the Earth, for thehalf of the globe turned away from the sun it is night….120[part0008.xhtml#ch01not120]Nothing new under the sun! So, did the knowledge in the Book of Enoch come fromthe ancient Greeks? Not at all, because, even in Plato’s time, it was known thatthe fundamental laws came from the gods. While we rebel against that kind ofnotion, it was plain, everyday knowledge to the Greek philosophers—these days,we’d call them scientists. Here’s an example:The participants of the Gorgias dialog were Socrates, Charephon, Gorgias,Callicles, and Polus—a truly intellectual group. Socrates opened up thediscussion by stressing that what he was about to say represented his firmconvictions, and he would stand by its truth. Then he explained that the wisdomand importance of geometry had also been known to the gods. In the third volumeof Plato’s Laws, this is made clear. Here the question is asked as to whetherthere may not exist an inkling of truth in the old legends (even back then!).What is specifically meant are those legends “of former, numerous humancatastrophes caused by flooding and similar disasters, from which only a smallfraction of the race of man could be saved.”121 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not121]The discussion hearkened upon the fact that mountain dwellers survived who—afteronly a few generations—lost all trace of memory of earlier civilizations. Thepeople simply believed “what was said of the gods and lived accordingly.”122[part0008.xhtml#ch01not122] To live together in harmony after the flood, “thepeople had to develop new rules, because no legislator of an earlier ageremained.”123 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not123] “As we do not make laws for the sonsof gods and heroes, like the legislators of antiquity, who themselves were theoffspring of gods…who likewise descended from gods, no one should hold itagainst us now….” [author’s italics].124 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not124]The most ancient laws were passed down by the gods—and we’re back to Enoch andhis dictating angels Pravuil and Uriel. “Never!” scream the evolutionists! TheEnoch texts were patched together by Jewish priests from the knowledge of theancient Greeks! Then what is the explanation for the fact that Enoch tells histale in the first person, telling his son Methuselah that “angels” carried himup to heaven on a fiery chariot and taught him their wisdom?In Plato’s dialogs, Timaeus and Critias report extensively on the entire storyof Atlantis—I’ll assume that my readers know how it goes. We hear how Solonwrote down the history of Atlantis from an ornamented column, “at the placewhere the River Nile branches, known as the Saïtic… the great city of Sais…thebirthplace of King Amasis….”125 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not125] This wise Solon, whobrought the story of Atlantis from Egypt to Athens, lived from around 640 to 560B.C. Solon copied down the story of an event that happened thousands of yearsbefore his own time from where it was inscribed on a tall column. And whofounded Atlantis? Poseidon, one of these sons of the gods—or, putting it in amore modern context, one of the descendents of Enoch’s mutinying crew who hadhad their evil way with the daughters of men and were not permitted to returnand continue their journey with the “Great Glory.” Let’s not forget: Poseidonalso impregnate a beautiful earthly maiden and Atlantis was originally createdto provide shelter for his new family. The mere fact that what the god Poseidoncreated with Atlantis was a superstate beyond the realm of contemporarytechnological comprehension, populated with a people that were vastly superiorto every other race of man, and where the buildings were covered in a specialalloy called orichalcum, doesn’t surprise me at all. But what does this shortdetour to Atlantis have to do with the Books of Enoch?Throughout the entire Enoch texts, there is no mention of Atlantis, or of anisland that disappeared in a flood, or of a superstate created by one of the“fallen angels.” Why not? Because the Enoch texts were written before the flood.“Only two things are infinite,” Einstein once said. “The universe and humanstupidity, and I’m not sure about the former.” Einstein wasn’t insulting any oneperson; he meant society in general.BACK TO VOYNICHBut isn’t this chapter supposed to be about the Voynich manuscript? What hasVoynich got to do with Enoch or the finds discovered by Father Crespi inEcuador? The Crespi collection contains writings engraved in stone and metalthat have never been taken seriously, because no one has ever really examinedthem properly. But panels like the Crespi engravings, the gilded collar with its16 symbols, or the metal pyramid with the elephants and the band of symbolsalong the bottom, have all been found thousands of kilometers north of Ecuador,in the United States, and again 12,000 kilometers eastwards, in France. There,in the tiny hamlet of Glozel, farmer Emile Fradin discovered thousands of piecesbetween the years 1924 and 1930. These included countless engraved stones andbones with symbols that no one ever analyzed. In his book GeheimakteArchäologie,126 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not126] Swiss journalist Luc Bürgindescribed these articles in detail—without making the slightest impression onthe academic community. But they had better take a closer look, because many ofthe symbols on the Glozel stones also appear on the items collected by FatherCrespi. Glozel in France and Cuenca in Ecuador are separated by some 12,000kilometers as the intercontinental crow flies. At least some of the Glozel itemshave been dated to 15–17,000 years before Christ. So who “copied” whom?Another enigmatic and highly controversial site is located in a remote valley inIllinois, in the United States. Sometime during the 1980s a number of artifactsstarted appearing, purportedly found in some cave somewhere by the idiosyncraticeccentric Russell Burrows. Alongside gilded objects, these also include stonerelics with engraved symbols. Unfortunately, Russell Burrows has been making ahuge song and dance about keeping the location of his find secret. Nevertheless,Luc Bürgin was lucky enough to get to photograph some of the artifacts and thusat least make them available to the public.127 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not127] Thesymbols on the items from the Burrows cave are suspiciously similar to boththose from Glozel and those in the Crespi collection. It seems that even inprehistoric times—and long before the flood—there were people who carved similarsymbols on stone, bone, and metal. What are we to make of this? Well, we shouldat least take a closer look and compare these things!The most impressive piece from the Crespi collection remains the roughly60-centimeter-tall gilded metal panel with its 56 “stamped” symbols. As FatherCrespi assured me—I visited him several times—this was just one prize examplefrom an entire metal library that lay in secret hiding places (more about thatin the next chapter). Some of the symbols resemble those used in the Voynichmanuscript. But that in itself is not reason enough to throw our hands in theair and shout, “Hurrah!” The Voynich manuscript has resisted every attempt atdeciphering as did the metal panels in the Crespi collection, even though theIndian Sanskrit specialist, Professor D.K. Kanjilaal, believed he was able toidentify certain ancient Brahman characters among the symbols. According toCrespi, Indian priests had assured him that the metal library described the raceof man in antediluvian times. That’s exactly what Enoch does. And he gets taughtthe secrets of nature, the solar system, and the universe by “angels.”In the Voynich manuscript, on the other hand, there are hundreds ofillustrations of plants that simply do not exist on Earth. With some of them,it’s hard to shake off the impression that they are depictions of botany takendown to the very molecular level. And then there are the strange pipes, vats,and bathtubs that are connected to each other and the plants. There are womensitting in them, as though frolicking in some kind of fountain of youth. None ofthis appears in the Enoch texts. Does that rule out any kind of comparisonbetween Voynich and Enoch?Enoch is said to have written more than 300 books. Books, in that bygone age,did not mean books as we know them today. They were rather scrolls or—to use amodern equivalent—brochures. Enoch handed these over, don’t forget, before hisinterstellar magical mystery tour, to his son Methuselah to preserve for thegenerations after the flood. We cannot rule out that one of these “brochures”somehow ended up in an old monastery somewhere and the monks faithfully copieddown the indecipherable script. But that’s all a little far-fetched. It wouldjust be too extraordinary if the not-yet-discovered Enoch texts includedknowledge about alien plants and recipes for immortality elixirs.A CLOSER LOOK AT THE TEXTThe Voynich manuscript contains words that are repeated constantly as thoughthey were some kind of key elements.image [../Images/image00160.jpeg]Folio 76 of the Voynich manuscript. If you look carefully, you can see that somesymbols appear again and again. Image courtesy of the Beinecke Library at YaleUniversity.Just take a look at folio 76 of the Voynich manuscript (you can see the number76 written in the upper right-hand corner). Now work your way down, one line ata time, preferably using a cover sheet to reveal each successive line. In themiddle of the first line you will see a closing syllable—it’s a bit small, butyou should manage it—that looks rather like a number “89.” On the next line, youwill find it again on the left, and on the fourth line it crops up five times,including four words in a row! This “89” also often turns up on the end of thesame words. On page 76 [part0004.xhtml#page_76] alone, “syllable 89”—if it iseven a syllable—appears something like 64 times. Thirteen of these are on thesame word. I always thought that a word’s frequency allowed us to drawconclusions about what it might mean. But this rule doesn’t seem to apply to theVoynich manuscript. There is one letter, which looks rather like a “4,” thatappears about 1,300 times on some pages.German linguist Erhard Landmann claims to have understood the content of theVoynich manuscript. Here’s one example: “The leap from our beginnings in spacewas truly a great one; and it is depicted in the Voynich manuscript. On folio‘f86rs’ of the Voynich manuscript, one can see an illustration of the Pleiadesand the star Aldebaran. A winding line connects the Pleiades to our solarsystem, depicted in the form of a sun with a human face….”128[part0008.xhtml#ch01not128]Mr. Landmann believes that the Pleiades are the ultimate source of humankind.One thing that is in no doubt is that many ancient races believed that the godshad come to them from the direction of the Pleiades (Maya, Inca, Maori, and soon). However, I cannot say how close Mr. Landmann is to the truth. The Voynichmanuscript has many pictures of stars: sometimes they run around the margins,then they turn up in different colors and sizes, at the top of the page or atthe bottom, then again in apparent astronomical explanations above zodiacalsigns, or they seem to be linked to the naked bathing women in their tubs. Thereare even a few that really do bear some relationship to stars in the Enochtexts.Take the illustration in the Voynich manuscript that features the three circularbands of texts, the stars, and the sun at the center. (See page 86[part0004.xhtml#page_86].)image [../Images/image00161.jpeg]A solar chart from the Voynich manuscript. Is this the link to Enoch? Imagecourtesy of Beinecke Library at Yale University.Red-blue rays radiate outwards from a central sun (with a face); in between themare unequal groups of stars. Have you counted the red-blue rays? There are 12 ofthem. If you think of the circle as a clock, then you can recognize “letters” atthree o’clock and, opposite, at nine o’clock. They are the same on bothsides—although the text at three is upside-down. Obviously, the same idea isbeing expressed twice. Twelve rays coming from the sun; between them suns, andall of it cut in half.What was in Enoch? “The luminary the Sun has its rising in the eastern portalsof the heaven, and its setting in the western portals of the heaven. And I sawsix portals in which the sun rises, and six portals in which the sun sets…. Onthat day the day is equalized with the night, and becomes of equal length….”(Chapter 72)129 [part0008.xhtml#ch01not129]Enoch speaks of “twelve portals” subdivided into six. The illustration in theVoynich manuscript shows exactly the same. Well, it could be just a coincidence,but maybe it will help the cryptographers in their long search for a solution,because at least they now have a clue what it’s about.As to the speculation about the origin of the Voynich manuscript, I think two ofthe options I mentioned can be forgotten straight away. The manuscript did notoriginate from the pen of any kind of Christian cleric. Why not? There isabsolutely no Christian symbology in the entire manuscript—and any Christianpseudo-saint would never have drawn all those bare ladies in their baths or allthe plants. That’s a naked fact.And the dreamer from the asylum? Not impossible, but this poor soul would havehad to know a lot about astronomy. Look at Enoch’s portals in which the sunrises and the equivalent diagram in the Voynich manuscript.“Man will occasionally stumble over the truth, butmost of the time he will pick himself up andcontinue on.”(Sir Winston Churchill, 1874–1965)"},{"pageContent":"DEBUNKING THE DEBUNKERSA STORM OF INDIĢNATIONMy book Aussaat und Kosmos (its English title was The Gold of the Gods) waspublished in August 1972. The work was 266 pages of text, and in just 12 of themI described an underground cave system in Ecuador in South America.I wrote about a table and some chairs that could be found in the tunnels andcaverns, continuing thus:Behind the chairs you can see animals—saurians, elephants, lions, crocodiles,jaguars, camels, bears, monkeys, bison, wolves—between them creeping lizards,snails, crustaceans. As though they had been cast where they stood, casually andamicably lined up in a row. Not in pairs, like the illustrations of Noah’s Ark.Not sorted according to genus and species, like a zoologist might have preferredto have seen it. And not in a hierarchy of natural evolution, like a biologistwould want to see. No, it is more like some kind of zoological garden ofinsanities, and all the animals are made of pure gold….Opposite this garden of beasts, to the left and behind some kind of conferencetable, could be seen a library consisting of metal panels. Some of them panels,some of them merely metal foils, just millimeters thick…. They stand next toeach other like the bound pages of some giant book. Every panel containswriting, stamped and evenly spaced as if written by some kind of machine. Moriczstill hasn’t managed to count all the pages of this massive metal library, but Iaccept his estimate that they number in the thousands.Whoever the creator of the library might have been and regardless of when hemight have put it together, it is clear that this great, unknown bibliophile andhis helpers were the masters of several different techniques for producing“made-to-measure” metal pages in large quantities. He also knew letters, withwhich he planned to tell future generations something that was important to him.This metal library was built to last; so that it would remain readableforever….1 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not1]These short passages from the book were enough to create a worldwide storm ofindignation. It started in the German-speaking countries, where most of themajor magazines accused me of lying, spread to the United States, and thenspread into the Spanish-speaking world. It was noted in every press archive,from where it doubled and quadrupled and became an avalanche that completelysteamrolled me. My reputation as an author was completely destroyed. People knewme as a peddler of fairytales and a swindler who was no longer to be believed.Archeologists announced that there were no major unexplored cave complexes inEcuador. The ones that were there had already been examined to the last inch byscientists. And of course, there was no metal library, and the metal panels inFather Crespi’s yard were nothing but cheap fakes. I had completely duped myreaders with a totally made-up story, just so I could make money.Naturally, I tried my best, back then, to defend myself—without the slightestsuccess. I was at rock bottom, and today I ask myself how I managed to pullthrough and publish another 20 successful nonfiction books in many differentcountries and languages after The Gold of the Gods (and a few novels, too!).Okay, I did all right, despite all the trouble, so why bring it all up againhere and now? Those who are believed to be dead often live longer! The story ofthis metal library is about to get hotter than ever. Behind a veil of secrecy,the race to find a certain location in Ecuador has already started. I know thegeographic location—and so do a few others! Smart journalists will be followingthis red-hot and sensational trail and will inevitably trip over the old snippetfrom The Gold of the Gods. And yet again, the archives will be plundered and theold stories about Erich von Däniken and his behavior will resurface. Because noone really knows—or can know—what actually happened 35 years ago.What on Earth did I do? Where did this story about an underground metal libraryreally come from? Did I really make it all up to make myself sound moreimportant than I really was? What kind of fool must I have been, and why did Iwrite that I was there in person if none of it could possibly have been true?None of it?AND NOW FOR SOME TRUTHDecades have passed since The Gold of the Gods was published. I have alwaysmaintained a meticulously well-organized archive. And now with a 35-yearcushion, I finally feel ready to publish certain documents from that time. Thisis nothing to do with proving that I’m right, or even for my own vanity. It’sjust an anathema to me to think that such an unbelievable treasure should justdisappear forever or—even worse—be appropriated by some religion. I want to showwhat really happened and what the current situation is regarding this hiddentreasure. Who lied? When? Why? What efforts have been made to clarify thesituation? And where, for heaven’s sake, is this metal library?!Before I get going, I’d like to clear up a few basic points.Since 1966—the year my first book, Chariots of the Gods, was published—I havewritten 29 books. In my youth, I was perhaps not as careful as I am now, notself-critical enough and a bit too trusting of some of my information sources. Ioften accepted information from third parties as being “the real McCoy,” gotcarried along by my own enthusiasm, or made errors in evaluating some kind ofevidence. To err is human, as they say, and it doesn’t hurt to admit it. In the9,000 or so pages that I have written it was inevitable that there would be anerror or two thrown in, or that over time it turned out that the “other side”was right after all and I was wrong. These days, when I discuss something withan expert, I know from the very start that he knows 10 thousand times more abouthis specialist subject than I do. These days, it’s more about not bluffing, notlying, and certainly not about trying to pull the wool over anyone’s eyes.“Listen and don’t butt in” has been my philosophy for years now. After everylong conversation with a scientist, I can admit that I have learned somethingnew—but so has he (or she), because my discussion partners must practicallyalways admit that they, too, know very little of my specialist knowledge.Mistakes can be corrected or put right.This conclusion is, in itself, nothing special, because it applies to everyauthor in the world. In every work of nonfiction—and very often in scientifictreatises, too—you can find errors if you search hard enough. Time doesn’t standstill, and our knowledge changes. Science is a living thing—and thank goodnessthat it is so, one might add, because looking at things in new ways is the onlyway to move forward.Now, there are some people who act as if a proven error in a theory is enough tonullify the whole idea. “If one piece of evidence in your book isn’t right,” Ioften hear, “then I have to assume that all the other evidence is false.”According to this absurd logic, we would have to throw away practically everyschoolbook, teaching book, or scientific book on the planet, because time showsus that many things that were once considered unshakeable truth are now known tobe wrong.There is another class of people who allow themselves to be blinded bysuperficialities and act like arrogant judges. These people are the ones whoconstantly cry “exposed!” and “fraud!” They are perpetually indignant and actlike they are carrying the troubles of the world on their feeble shoulders. Andfinally, there are the religious types who, although they do not want to see orhear anything at all, (unlike the famous trio of monkeys) can’t stop playing theeternal schoolmaster.This last category, with whom authors have little joy, are the ones who, despitenever having read a book, will pick up on some point from a newspaper review orsimilar, and concoct their own “exposé”—and without actually ever asking theauthors what they meant. How often have I read: “Däniken says…” or “writes…”although I never said or wrote anything of the sort? Well-meaning friends oftenadvise me to sue. But if I started down that road, I’d have to employ my ownlawyer and would spend around a third of my time tracking down who said the liesin the first place. The sad consequence of the swindle nightmare culminates withthe conclusion: “He never denied anything.”Joachim Ringelnatz once wrote: “Boomerang flew away, didn’t come back that day.Hours the patient people stood, waiting for that piece of wood.” Well, now theboomerang is coming back, even if it has taken 35 years. So what really didhappen in Ecuador?AN EXPEDITION INTO THE UNKNOWNIn 1970, a Swiss national living in Ecuador sent me a newspaper cutting with anote attached that what it contained would surely be something that wouldinterest me. The page was from the prestigious newspaper El Telégrafo, which ispublished in Guayaquil in Ecuador. The headline announced a “genuinesubterranean world in America.” The sub-headline went further: “The Moricz 1969expedition will revolutionize world history.”2 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not2] Thewhole-page article was backed up with black-and-white pictures that not onlyshowed the team entering a cave complex, but also the entrance to a subterraneanlabyrinth. This entranceway, wider than a barn door, gave the impression that itwas some kind of constructed opening with mighty, layered, monolithiccrossbeams.All of the expedition team was listed: Juan Moricz, Gaston Fernández, Dr.Gerardo Peña Matheus, Lilian Icaza, Hernán Fernández, Mario Polit, Pedro Luna,and José Rojas. In addition, there were military expedition members, including a“Capitan” Carlos Guerrero Guerron, as well as the national policerepresentatives Officers Ortiz, Benusia, and Sanchez. At the end, there was alist of diverse helpers, guides, and leaders.All in all, a pretty large-scale, highly organized expedition into the junglesof Ecuador. What were they looking for? The Argentinean German-language magazineLa Plata Ruf interviewed the expedition leader Juan Moricz. Here is an extractin which Moricz is speaking:Really, it’s not so much a discovery because we have known of the existence ofthe Cuevas de los Tayos for a long time. The purpose of the expedition was tophotograph, film and document a largely unknown or denied archeologicalreality…. We also wanted to pave the way for a second, more extensive expeditionin which we would find proof that this rediscovered subterranean world was wherethe fathers of human civilization had lived and worked…. The cave system goes onfor thousands of kilometers, stretching far out under our American continent,particularly under the Cordillera massif. The air is clean and the ventilationis perfect, and the temperature remains at a constant 20 degrees centigrade. Theentrance is located at an altitude of around 1,000 meters above sea level androughly 300 meters below the mountain’s peak. After entering the cave systemthrough this entrance, the light of the torches and lanterns reveals anoverwhelming underground vista. Around 60 to 80 meters wide and between 100 and120 meters high, it looks like an enormous hall with walls and ceiling made ofartistically carved stone blocks and panels. But this is nothing more than thebeginning of a colossal roadway…. The section that we have explored is littlemore than a fraction. We were able to discover numerous corridors, galleries andhalls branching off this main avenue, but we have not yet investigated them….3[part0008.xhtml#ch02not3]The article goes on to tell about the location of the entrance. From the town ofCuenca in the southeastern corner of Ecuador, they set out with a team of 43mules and expert local guides towards El Pescado, Tres Copales, La Esperanza,and La Union to a local army base. From there they traveled by canoe to LaPuntilla, where the Rio Santiago meets the Rio Coangos. Then came a hard marchby foot to the small settlement of Guajare, where they set up their base campfor the expedition.The story, covered in several newspapers and magazines (many more than I’vementioned here), fascinated me to my very core, and was one that I definitelywanted to find out more about. Everything centered on this expedition leader,Juan Moricz. Who was he? I wrote to the editorial office of El Telégrafo inGuayaquil and asked them to tell me more! There was no answer to my letter, norto my second and third. Were they even getting there? So I tried the telephone—abit of a trial back then in 1970 because there were no automatic connections toEcuador. I asked for the chief editor, Jorge Blinkhorn, who had written thearticle, without success. As nothing at all had been published in Europe aboutthis sensational expedition, I was left with little option: I had to fly theremyself!A FASCINATINĢ MEETINGOn March 1, 1972, I took an Air France jet to Guayaquil. I found quarters in theHotel Atahualpa and then made my way straight to the offices of El Telégrafo. Ittook a while, but finally I was standing in front of one of the editors, but hecouldn’t—or wouldn’t—help me. Of course they knew Señor Juan Moricz, but nobodyhad his address. But what about the lawyer called Peña, who was also mentionedin the article? Surely, he must know how to reach Moricz. They had Peña’saddress and handed it over.Señor Dr. Gerardo Peña Matheus greeted me quietly in his large and rather cooloffice in Guayaquil. I guessed that he was around 30. His well-groomedappearance and objective way of speaking made me feel that he was somebody whocould be trusted. Within a short time, he admitted to me that both he and JuanMoricz had read my first two books and had already discussed some of mytheories. “Is this story about the expedition and the underground cave systemtrue?” I wanted to know. Señor Peña confirmed it with a nod of his head and wenton to tell me how they had only been able to explore two cave entrances in 1969,because Juan Moricz had not trusted their military escorts. What? Yes, repeatedPeña; they hadn’t really had enough provisions with them and the atmosphere wasdeteriorating from one moment to the next. Unlike the military men and thepolice officers, the civilians in the party had been unarmed. If they had reallystumbled onto anything valuable, they might have had to fear for their lives inthe company of these uniformed men. Peña remained completely objective andshowed me an issue of the magazine Vistazo from December 1969. It contained along article about the Expedición Moricz 1969. I wanted to know if he trustedJuan Moricz: “Absolutely!”From his office, Peña called several locations in Ecuador where he thought JuanMoricz might be. After what seemed like an age of trying, he finally got lucky,and he told me he had managed to pass on a message to Moricz, who would callback as soon as possible. I made my way back to my hotel for a long overduesleep. Guayaquil lies on the Pacific coast, a little below the equator. The airis humid and damp, and in my thoughts I praised the inventor of airconditioning.On the evening of March 4, 1972, Juan Moricz arrived in town. The tall,well-built man had the air of an aristocrat. His steely blue eyes examined mecoldly at first, then classified me as friendly before he reached out his hand.We made our way to the bar and chatted about my books, before wandering off withDr. Peña to the Hotel Atahualpa’s classy, ocean-view restaurant. I found outthat Moricz had Hungarian ancestry (his real name was János Móricz), butArgentinean nationality. I didn’t press him any further on the issue. I wasn’tinterested in knowing whether he was a political refugee; I was simply burningto find out more about the underground complex. Moricz was reticent at first,but thawed noticeably during the course of the evening and eventually begantelling me one of the most unbelievable stories I have ever heard.There exists, so Moricz told me, an ancient relationship between the Magyars andEcuador that is thousands of years old. It can be shown by the countless commonword roots belonging to the two peoples, which are equivalent both phoneticallyas well as in basic meaning. Moricz sketched an impressive list on the napkin.The underground world, he said, was the product of one of mankind’s progenitors,the Táltosok Barlangja, as he is known in the Hungarian tongue. Táltos is theHungarian term for one of the ancient priest caste, and barlang means cave. TheTáltosok Barlangja had lived in an underground cave system, protected by a holybird, the very same “tayo”—or “turul” in Hungarian—after which this tunnelsystem had been named. My head was soon spinning with this confusing lesson incomparative linguistics all the more, because I don’t know any Hungarian and wasin no position to judge whether Moricz’s claims were true. We spoke then aboutthe ancient legend of Romulus and Remus, the founders of the city of Rome withits seven hills. Moricz assured me that the legend—including the sevenhills—could just as easily have been about Quito, the capital of Ecuador.“And what about the metal library?” I asked. “Does it really exist?”Moricz nodded earnestly. “Down below, there is an oval table surrounded bychairs. Not chairs as we know them, but more like armchairs whose lower partlooks like an ‘n.’ And on top of that is a ‘u.’”“What are they made of?” I asked, intrigued.Moricz wrinkled his brow and shrugged his shoulders. “I don’t know what thematerial is,” he admitted. “It’s neither wood nor metal, but somehow gives theimpression that it has been cast.” Then he went on to tell me about a kind ofzoological garden of metal animals, mostly gold or at least gilded. Practicallyevery kind of animal imaginable was down there, even elephants, although theywere unknown in prehistoric South America. And then there were mythologicalbeasts, hybrids, chimera, animals that were half-man/half-beast, and figuresthat he couldn’t even recognize. There were even really small creatures, likespiders and flies, mixed among them. In total, there must have been more than athousand animals that someone had cast at some time in metal. And thesubterranean repository also contained other treasures made of crystal andprecious stones, “a real millennia-old treasure trove.”“And the metal library?” I pressed.Moricz paused again, somewhat longer this time, and stared out of the windowinto the nocturnal lights of Guayaquil. Then he began to tell me about books andsheets of metal: everywhere, engraved writing that looked as if it had beenstamped into the metal. The tomes were made of a yellow metal and were veryheavy. He guessed that the weight of a single volume must have been around 30kilograms. This metal library was distributed through several undergroundcaverns. Altogether, there must have been thousands of pages featuring anunknown and ancient script.“And why do you believe that this metal library contains the prehistory ofmankind? That was what I read in El Telégrafo”Moricz assured me that some of the pages contained star systems andillustrations, graphical depictions that couldn’t possibly be interpreted anyother way.THE MORMON CONNECTIONI was dumbfounded. Then I thought of Enoch, who I had been interested in sincemy time in high school. But why should Enoch texts be made of metal, and how onEarth could they have got to Ecuador from the biblical Arabia? It wasn’t exactlyon the route for the antediluvian prophet or any of his descendents. Finally, Ihad an idea! The Mormons! Their ascendents are said to have come from Arabia—atleast that is what it says in the Book of Mormon. These Mormon stories couldactually have something to do with the metal library in Ecuador. Why?The founder of the Mormon Church—or, to give it its proper name, the Church ofJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints—Mister Joseph Smith (1805–1844) experienced,according to his own accounts, what can only be described as a strangeencounter. He told how an angel named Moroni came to him and announced thatwithin a mountain, not far from where he was living, lay a treasure in a stonehiding place. Inside he would find a book printed on golden plates whoseengravings contained a complete account of the earlier inhabitants of theAmerican continent and their origins. Next to the gold plates he would find abreastplate to which was affixed two stones, called Urim and Thummim. By usingthese stones, he would be able to translate the ancient writings. He would alsofind a “divine compass.” All of these items were to be found in a hill known asCumorah to the south of Palmyra in Wayne County, New York, not far from thehamlet of Manchester.Joseph Smith did as he was ordered and somewhere below the peak of the hill hereally did find the treasures. How he did it, he describes in his own words:….under a stone of considerable size, lay the plates, deposited in a stone box.This stone was thick and rounding in the middle on the upper side, and thinnertowards the edges, so that the middle part of it was visible above the ground,but the edge all around was covered with earth.Having removed the earth, I obtained a lever, which I got fixed under the edgeof the stone, and with a little exertion raised it up. I looked in, and thereindeed did I behold the plates, the Urim and Thummim, and the breastplate, asstated by the messenger. The box in which they lay was formed by laying stonestogether in some kind of cement. In the bottom of the box were laid two stonescrossways of the box, and on these stones lay the plates and the other thingswith them.4 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not4]As Joseph Smith, eager as any treasure-hunter, reached in with both hands totouch the objects he felt a jolt. He tried again—and again received a jarringshock. At the third attempt, he was hit by such a mighty bolt that he laystunned for several moments on the floor. Immediately, the angel Moroni, thatmysterious nocturnal messenger, appeared and instructed him to return each yearon the same day to this spot. When the time was right, he would receive the holyobjects.Four years later, that day finally came. On September 22, 1827, God’s messengerMoroni presented Joseph Smith with the inscribed gold plates, the breastplate,and the shimmering translation aids Urim and Thummim. Smith described the goldenplates as being somewhat thinner than one would usually expect of sheet metal;the individual “pages” were held together with three rings; the book was roughly15 centimeters wide, 20 centimeters tall, and 15 centimeters thick. He had noproblem flicking through the first third of the metal sheets, but the rest werefused together into a single block or “sealed.”Today’s Book of Mormon from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints isbased on the translations of those mysterious plates. Eleven witnesses confirmedthat they had seen the plates, but after the work was completed, the angelMoroni removed them to a place of safety, to preserve them for a futuregeneration.In the Book of Mormon, the 24 plates—they are known as the Books of Ether andNephi—tell the story of the people of Jared. The Jaredites are said to have beenraised by God at the time of the building of the Tower of Babel. He had led theminitially into the wilderness and then over the great ocean to the Americancoast in small boats that were “tight like unto a dish.” The light in the darkvessels was provided by 16 glowing stones, two for each ship, which providedthem with illumination for 344 days. They also had a compass whose needle alwayspointed in the direction that they must travel. Both light and compass came fromthe same mysterious God who had helped the Jaredites in other situations:And it came to pass that they were many times buried in the depths of the sea,because of the mountainous waves which broke upon them, and also the great andterrible tempests which were caused by the fierceness of the wind. And it cameto pass that when they were buried in the deep there was no water that couldhurt them, their vessels being tight like unto a dish, and also they were tightlike unto the ark of Noah; therefore when they were encompassed about by manywaters they did cry unto the Lord, and he did bring them forth again upon thetop of the waters. (Ether, verses 6 and 7)5 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not5]PUTTINĢ THE PIECES TOĢETHERBut what have the Mormons got to do with the metal library in Ecuador, or evenwith the Book of Enoch? While Juan Moricz was telling his gripping tale in therestaurant of the Hotel Atahualpa in Guayaquil and I listened, fascinated by histale, one part of my subconscious mind was constantly making connections withboth the Book of Mormon and the Book of Enoch. I had been acquainted with theBook of Mormon since my time in high school (two of my closest friends wereMormons) so I knew that the Jaredites were descendent from one of Jared’sbrothers and Jared himself was—can you guess?—Enoch’s father! In my book TheGods and Their Grand Design, I looked at other aspects of this story. So, JuanMoricz’s treasures in Ecuador could certainly have something to do with theMormon’s Books of Ether and Nephi. And the connection to Enoch is not so much ofa leap either: the Jaredites in the Book of Mormon are descendents of Enoch. Andthat’s not all. Let’s take a look back. In the book of Ether, the Jareditestravel to their new home in eight windowless vessels, each one of them sealed“tight.” Practically the same crossing is described in the Babylonian didacticcreation epic Enûma Eliš. It describes a great flood, but the survivor is notnamed Noah, but rather Atra-Hasis.6 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not6] The fragments ofthe epic that have survived tell how the god Enki gives his chosen survivor,Atra-Hasis, exact instructions on how to build his ship. When Atra-Hasiscomplains that he knows nothing of ship construction, the god Enki draws him anoutline of a ship in the ground and explains it to him. American orientalistZecharia Sitchin writes:Enki spoke of a boat “roofed superficially and underneath hermetically sealedwith tar lasts.” They must not have deck nor openings, “so that the sun did notsee the interior.” It had to be a boat “like a boat of the Apsu, a Sulili”; andit is the very term used nowadays in Hebrew (soleleth) to denote a submarine.“Let the boat,” Enki said, “be a MA.GUR.GUR”—“a boat that can turn and tumble.”7[part0008.xhtml#ch02not7]It’s no different in the Mormon’s Book of Ether. Ether makes the same objectionas Atra-Hasis—namely, I don’t know how to build a ship—and the mysterious Godgives the same instructions. (In the Bible, Noah also receives instructions onhow to build his Ark from “God”—whoever that might have been. And Noah is alsoone of Enoch’s descendents.)The crux of all these complicated observations is this: Joseph Smith claimed tohave received his golden plates from the angel Moroni in 1827. At that time,there were no linguists or other specialists who could have translated theBabylonian/Sumerian texts, because they were not discovered until after Smith’sdeath—and that includes the Epic of Gilgamesh with its flood stories. So how dowe explain the congruencies between the Book of Ether and the other texts thatonly turned up much later? Were the ancient chroniclers of the Enûma Eliš lyingwhen they described how Atra-Hasis received instruction from the god Enki on howto construct his vessel? Why did Noah and Utnapishtim in the Epic of Gilgameshneed the prompting of ominous-sounding gods before they had the idea of buildingwatertight and weatherproof ships to survive? In what kind of magic workshopwere the artificial lights and the compass used by the Jaredites hobbledtogether? And who was capable of manipulating genes or carrying out artificialinsemination, like the Book of Enoch (and many others!) mentions?Surely not the great God of the universe who the religions hold in such highregard. It brings us inexorably back to Enoch’s extraterrestrials, the “fallenangels” or “heavenly legions.” And what was Enoch destined for? To be a writer,who was the recipient of a few hundred books and who then passed them on to hisson Methuselah so he could “deliver them to the generations of the world” afterthe flood. And where did the original inhabitants of America come from? The“bible” of the Quiché Mayas tells us the answer:And thus vanished and went hence Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucatah andJaqu-Balam: the first people who came across the sea from the beginnings of thesun. Many ages hence they came and died only at a great age. And they were knownas “servants of God”…and they brought with them over the seas the writings of Tula. These writingsthey called them in which all their history was written down. [author’sitalics]8 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not8]MONTEZUMA’S SPEECHIn 1519, while the Spanish conquistadores were encamped before their capitalTenochtitlan (Mexico), the Aztec leader Montezuma (1466-1520) gave an impressivespeech to his priests and other dignitaries that began like this: “Both you andI know that our forefathers did not come from this land where we live. They cameto this place, led by a great prince from far hence.”9 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not9]I already knew some of these stories in 1972 because I had been researching thegreat histories of mankind since 1959. Sitting there, opposite this expeditionleader, Juan Moricz, I somehow learned again how to marvel. He claimed to knowall of these crazy stories from personal experience. Could I trust him? Hislawyer, Peña, who had known him for many years and who had also accompanied himon the expedition in 1969, trusted Moricz implicitly. I thought again of theMormons and of Enoch, and told myself: none of it’s impossible. These ancientwritings exist somewhere on our planet—why not Ecuador? Then I asked Moricz whathis future plans were.He wanted to write a book about his experiences, he told me: a book that wouldshock the world and the major religions to their cores. This book, he said,would have to be published everywhere at the same time. Here, I expressed somequite-justified doubts. Most publishing houses are normally not really set up tobring out books in different countries and in different languages at the sametime. Maybe one of the major houses would be able to manage to publish the bookin five different countries on the same day, but never in 20 countries. Moriczdid not think much of my pessimism. Maybe I could, I suggested, write somethingabout this fantastic world in my next book—put out a tasty morsel, so to speak,to make the publishing houses sit up and take notice of Juan Moricz. I was alsopretty certain that I could rustle up some money in Germany and Switzerland fora second Juan Moricz expedition. The figure I mentioned was $200,000. Of course,it was exciting for me to get the chance to do a kind of sneak preview—but inwhat form? I still had some gnawing doubts. How could I make Moricz appealing tomy critical publisher in Germany as well as my readers? “Is there some kind ofdocument,” I asked Moricz, “that relates to your discovery and is utterlyincontestable?”Moricz and Peña exchanged glances and then nodded. They could sense that I stillhad some doubts. In the meantime, the clock showed that it was well pastmidnight; an Ecuadorian trio were playing their guitars, roaming from table totable, and singing heartrendingly melancholy love songs. We had already knockedback three bottles of Chilean red wine and had really got going by then. “Thereis such a document,” Moricz stated. “We will show it to you tomorrow.”The next day, Dr. Peña handed over an official-looking document. The first pagecarried the heading “Escritura” and above it the national coat of arms ofEcuador. The document had been drawn up by a notary, Dr. Gustavo Falconi L., andit was dated July 21, 1969. I published the cover page on page nine of The Goldof the Gods. I only revealed a small portion of its explosive contents 35 yearsago, but here is the entire and unexpurgated text, translated into English:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1st copy, Register of titlein the year 1969 by the 4th notary of the cantonof Guayaquil, July 21, 1969Dear Minister of Finance,I, Juan Moricz, citizen of Argentina by settlement, born in Hungary, passportnumber 4361689, by my own right and by your mediation with the office of hisExcellency, the President of the Republic, do hereby declare that: in theeastern region, in the province of Morona-Santiago, within the boundaries of theRepublic of Ecuador, I did discover valuable objects of great cultural andhistorical value to mankind. These consist of metal panels that were created byhuman hand and contain a summary of the history of a lost civilization, of whichmankind has currently neither inkling nor proofs. I have made this discoverythrough dint of my own good fortune while I was carrying out investigations inmy capacity as a scientist specializing in folkloric, ethnological andlinguistic aspects of Ecuadorian tribes. The objects I discovered can bedescribed as follows: 1. Objects of various shapes and sizes made of metal andstone. 2. Metal panels engraved with symbols and ideographic scripts. This is agenuine metal library which contains a summary of the history of mankind; theorigin of man on Earth, as well as scientific knowledge about a lostcivilization. The fact of this discovery makes me the legal owner of theseobjects in accordance with Article 665 of the Civil Code. However, because theseare items of immeasurable cultural value and I did not discover them on my ownland or property, Article 666 of the Civil Code applies. As the land and thecaves in which I made the discoveries belong to the state of Ecuador inaccordance to Article 55 of the current political constitution, I am required toshare my discovery with the aforementioned state. In accordance with the CivilCode, the owners of the land are accorded rights over the discovery. Therefore,in accordance with Article 58 of the constitution I have turned to you. Article58 states that the artistic and archeological value of a find remains undercontrol of the state. In accordance with Articles 3 and 9 of the Agriculturallegislation, it is the task of the Finance Ministry to monitor the lawsregarding the property of the state, and to inform the President of theRepublic.As a sign of my honesty and willingness to protect the rights of the state ofEcuador, I am registering my discovery with your Excellency, the President ofthe Republic. I am doing this to ensure that the Republic of Ecuador is in aposition to secure both its own and my rights. I would like to request that youset up an Ecuadorian commission of control. I will show this commission theexact position and location of the caves, as well as the objects within. Ireserve the right to show the people nominated by you photographs, films andalso original drawings. Furthermore, I would like to state that—in thefulfillment of my rights as the discoverer and owner of this find and inaccordance with the law—I will not reveal the exact location of the find untilthe members of the commission have been appointed. This commission should alsocontain members that I may be allowed to appoint.(Signed and sealed by Juan Moricz and the lawyer, Dr. Peña)10[part0008.xhtml#ch02not10]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------A GENTLEMEN’S AĢREEMENTThis certificate of ownership knocked me sideways. It meant that we were nottalking about the vague hope of seeing a metal library somewhere, but-plain asday—“objects I discovered.” Engraved metal panels and ideographic scripts werementioned: “This is a genuine metal library which contains a summary of thehistory of mankind.” I congratulated Moricz, but felt that I had to add that,despite the seeming clarity of the legal situation, I could not write aboutsomething in my next book without at least having seen some small part of itwith my own eyes. Moricz said that that was not really possible because we wouldneed to put an entire expedition together just to reach the underground caves.But he could show me pictures of the main entrance, and I could make copies if Iliked. I was happy, but somehow not entirely satisfied. Filled with enthusiasmafter hearing Moricz’s story and seeing the notary’s document, I was burning toget to the jungle and see for myself. If the cave system was as extensive asMoricz claimed, surely there must be other entrances that one could get towithout mounting a major expedition. How about using a helicopter?Moricz waved the suggestion aside, explaining that there weren’t that manyhelicopters to be had in Ecuador and that the few that were around were in thehands of either the military or the oil companies. Then he made a suggestion; Iperked up. He knew of a small offshoot of the cave system. There wasn’t much tosee, but it might satisfy my curiosity. There was one condition, however: I wasnot to reveal the location and I was to imply that I had actually been at themain entrance. Why? Moricz insisted that if I were to write in my book thatthere was another entrance—and what’s more, an entrance that was easier to getto—or even disclose the location, then the treasure-hunters would soon beswarming all over the place. He didn’t need to tell me what would happen next.We shook on it. To be honest, I would have even agreed to far stricterconditions. I was so excited about Moricz’s discovery and utterly taken in bythe calm and considered way he talked about it. On top of that, I had been onthe trail of extraterrestrials since my youth and often been mocked or met withpitying smiles. And now, out of the blue, here was a chance to make the publicaware of a metal library that—according to Moricz—would support many of mytheories. What a find! My last remaining doubts had been simply wiped away bythe notary’s certificate.The next day, we set off in a red Toyota off-road vehicle, driving for hours ina southerly direction, up and down mountains, until we reached the city ofCuenca. Moricz filled up the tank, checked the water, oil, and spare gascanister, and then we set off again into the wilderness. For me, Ecuador was a“terra incognita,” an unknown country. I didn’t have a clue where we wereheaded. Moricz drove down narrow roads past bushes, giant trees, and Indio huts.He repeatedly stopped the car, turned around, and drove back several kilometers.At some point, we could see a large river meandering below us. Moricz stopped,got out, and looked around before climbing back in, driving around a cultivatedfield and then setting off yet again in another new direction. Suddenly he criedout, “There it is! Up there!” He pointed diagonally upward, toward a steep rockycrag that was totally overgrown with bushes. We got out of the car and scrambledup a narrow mule path to get to the top. Although there was no visiblesettlement here, an Indio herdsman and two children suddenly appeared at oursides. They were dressed in black ponchos and were wearing broad-rimmed hats.Moricz spoke to the man; I couldn’t understand a word. Abruptly, a sloping caveentrance came into view. Behind it was a deep, dark hole. We squatted down onthe stone floor, Moricz laying his high-powered flashlight on the ground betweenhis legs.He had given me a flashlight before we began our ascent. I made the most of theopportunity, and set up my Nikon camera on a ledge and pressed thedelayed-action shutter release. Afterward, we crawled a few meters into thecave. From deep within the dull depths we could hear the rumbling of water. Ihad left my camera equipment outside, guarded by the herdsman and his children.Apart from a few strange figures and stone sculptures that stood out in thescampering torchlight, there was little to see. Certainly no metal library.image [../Images/image00162.jpeg]Together with Moricz at the mouth of the cave.image [../Images/image00163.jpeg]Moricz in front of the same cave (during the earlier expedition).Back in Guayaquil, Moricz handed over a glossy black-and-white print of the 1969expedition and granted me express permission to use it in my new book. I flewback to Switzerland shortly thereafter and began writing the first chapter ofThe Gold of the Gods—but not the way it later appeared in the printed book. I’llget back to that later. First, I’d like to present a short “film” of whatactually happened.Back then there was a Swiss periodical called Sie & Er (Her & Him). It hadmanaged to persuade my publisher in Düsseldorf, Germany, to grant it the rightto publish exclusive previews of the new book. Months before the book was evenfinished, extracts began appearing in Sie & Er. But the text no longer had quitethe same sober tone as I had originally used. So I hopped on a plane—with a copyof Sie & Er in my suitcase—and flew off to Ecuador. I showed Juan Moricz and Dr.Peña the extract in the magazine, including the pictures. Moricz could speak alittle German, but not really enough to understand the text. I translated, oneline at a time. Moricz found the somewhat-theatrical rendering of my work okay.He said that it was like what they do in shop window displays where the productsare presented in a more dramatic light. But everything that appeared concerningthe metal library and the other objects was accurate enough. A few months laterThe Gold of the Gods was published—and then the real drama began.SOME UNEXPECTED EDITSBut how did my book come to be published in a form different to my originalmanuscript? Well, it’s like this: every publishing house employs copy editorswho read the works—especially those by younger or less well-known authors—andcorrect them, revise them where necessary, and sometimes shorten or fill outpassages. One such was Mr. Utz Utermann, who had originally worked in the filmindustry and, since the war, had reworked several scripts into excellent films.I put great value on his qualities as a person and a writer, and I was able tolearn much from him. (In The Gold of the Gods, in the credits at the top of thethird page, Utz Utermann appears as one of the contributors to the book underhis pseudonym from back then, Wilhelm Roggersdorf.) My publisher, Mr. ErwinBarth von Wehrenalp, head of the ECON publishing house in Düsseldorf, got intouch with his editor Utz Utermann to find out how good the Ecuador story was.At the time, I was in Egypt, and Utz Utermann had been commissioned to puttogether an exciting version of the story for Sie & Er. He answered on October7, 1972, in a letter to Erwin Barth von Wehrenalp. I received a copy. The letterexplained how the fateful (for me at least) version came about. Here it is infull:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Dear Mr. von Wehrenalp,After a hectic few days at the book fair which forced us to make a fewexplanatory telephone calls, I believe I owe you an explanation, too. Of course,I’ve had a few worried moments, wondering if I could have done more research onthe Ecuador issue.As you know, I spent some more time with Mr. von Däniken in Bonstetten in Maywhile I was working on the manuscript. On the evening of May 14, Mr. von Dänikenplayed me a tape on which he had dictated the chapter about the caves and thegold. My first reaction was: “That’s so fantastic, no one will believe it if wedon’t offer some sort of documentary proof: photos, documents, etc.”Däniken showed me around 15 black-and-white photos and color slides relating tothe subject. These supported ad oculos the text he had dictated. When I pressedhim to publish all of the photos, Däniken told me that he had promised Moriczthat he would not publish certain photographs. Only the photos that Moricz hadspecifically released could appear in the book. Despite my dogged insistence,Däniken wouldn’t be swayed. “No,” he said, “I promised Moricz that I would notpublish any photos apart from these. Basta!”Then he fetched the notary’s certificate from July 21, 1969, (as it appears onpage 9 [part0004.xhtml#page_9] of the book) from his papers. The certificate a)confirms Moricz as the discoverer of the caves and b) described the objectsdiscovered within. We put the certificate into the book as a piece of convincingdocumentary evidence.Däniken also showed me a full-page article from one of Ecuador’s leadingnewspapers—“El Mercurio”—containing a report on the official inspection of thecaves by representatives of the state, military, etc. The report lists themembers of the expedition by name. It’s hardly creditable that the country’sleading newspaper would write about something doesn’t even exist anymore.We looked through all of the documentary evidence that Däniken had collectedwhile in the country, to see what we could actually use. We found a businesscard belonging to the lawyer, Dr. Peña, who looks after Moricz’s interests. Isaid, “We have to put a copy of this in the book with a note to the effect thatany scientists who are interested in serious research should contact Peña toarrange access to the Moricz caves!”Däniken thought it was a great idea. He was immediately in favor of doing justthat—without reservation. “That’s it! That’s exactly what Moricz and Peña need.They’re looking for some serious scientific support and they’re hoping that mybook will help them to find it.”Anyone who doubts a) that Däniken was in a small part (which is all that isclaimed in the book) of the Moricz caves or b) that these caves—which Moriczclaims to be man-made constructions—even exist, then they must ask themselvesthe cardinal question:If Däniken had any doubts as to the authenticity of his reports, why would heprovide his naysayers with the opportunity to debunk his claims by publishingPeña’s business card?Do people think he is so crazy that he would sharpen the knife just so that theycould scalp him with it? If he wasn’t absolutely certain that his facts werestraight then he could simply have written about caves that he had seenbut—sworn to secrecy—whose location he couldn’t or wasn’t permitted to reveal.That would still have made a good read and the jungle is big enough to cover histracks. One thing his certain: without revealing Peña’s address any journalisticresearch would have been next to impossible.And this brings me to the weak point in the argument:Didn’t Moricz and Peña suspect what kind of repercussions would come from thepublishing of a book by Erich von Däniken? Däniken had a pretty good idea. Heenjoys provoking discussion. And for that reason alone, he would never back uphis stories with such flimsy evidence. He could go the “easy route” and makelife much simpler for himself by making statements that people couldn’t check.Do they think he’s such a fool that he would leave a trail leading to his owndestruction?If Däniken was as unscrupulously sly as some people are trying to claim, then itdoesn’t make an awful lot of sense for him to provide those checking up on himwith a means to destroy his arguments. So, what has happened in Ecuador sinceDäniken made his two visits? Are Moricz and Peña so filled with consternationabout the resonance that is now bringing journalists to their homeland? If—and Isee no reason to doubt the facts reported in “Die Stern”—Moricz and Peña reallydid react as described, what is the reason? Did they—at the end of theday—really want to protect “their” caves from state interference? Do theyreally, as Däniken has told it, have such a manic fear of hoards of treasurehunters?Did somebody translate the “Spiegel” article for them, which reported thatDäniken has earned 3 million Deutschmarks from his first two books? And maybesaid to them “Look! Now he’s been to visit you, and he’ll be shoveling in themoney from your caves as well!” The fact that this might lead the two men to befilled with jealousy and drop Däniken like a hot potato seems to me to be ahuman enough reaction, even if it’s not particularly nice. But in attempting toshed some light onto these dubious events, one has to consider alleventualities.It becomes all the more curious and incredible when one takes into considerationthat Däniken, during his second visit to Moricz and Peña in August, showed thetwo gentlemen three episodes of the preview version in the Swiss magazine “Sie &Er,” which contained the entire caves and gold chapter! And he translated it allfor them, too.On August 14, early in the morning, Mrs. Däniken called me and told me that shehad had a call from a man in Cuenca, to tell me that Moricz and Peña were overthe moon about the publication!This statement interests me in particular, because I—to make the cave texts alittle more colorful and provide the reader with a more lasting impression—addeda few “lighting effects” to Däniken’s original.When Däniken got back, I asked him what Moricz had thought about this “artisticlicense.” Däniken said Moricz was totally in favor. He said, “It’s like aproduct in the shop window display that you have to put under the spotlight tomake it sell better.”Seeing as Moricz had given his blessing to my “lighting effects,” I wasrelieved. I wish that some of these journalistic reports only contained thatkind of extra color instead of always twisting the facts.That only leaves the Cuenca gold belonging to Father Crespi.Däniken has never claimed that the works in Crespi’s possession are anythingmore than brass and silver panels—only, he never actually wrote it in his book.This fact hasn’t cropped up in any of the so-called “exposés” in “Stern” or theTV channel ZDF. They showed some objects, but not those that Dänikenphotographed and put in his book.Signed: Utz Utermann, Roggersdorf11 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not11]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------A pretty long letter, and one that clarifies quite a bit, but it doesn’t releaseme from my responsibilities as an author (even if the pages that were later soheavily criticized didn’t actually come from my pen). So, what really happened?Why the sudden attacks and attempts to make me look ridiculous?THE PRESS GETS INVOLVEDAfter The Gold of the Gods was published, two South America correspondents fromDer Stern magazine went to visit Dr. Peña in Guayaquil. According to theirresearch, the whole story about the metal library and my visit to the sideentrance to the cave complex was a complete fabrication. In the bestjournalistic tradition, one of the editors of Stern asked for my reaction—beforethe article went to print. I answered on September 17, 1972:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Dear Mr. Blumenschein.I would like to request an interview with you, so I can present my side of thefacts before my reputation is irreparably damaged by a one-sided and biasedpresentation of the story. As you know, any later retractions or corrections, aswell as any evidence presented at a later date are read and noticed by nobody.Mr. Haaf [Stern editor] carried out a short interview with me on the telephonein which he asserted that Messrs. Moricz and Peña had claimed that I was neverin the underground tunnel system and all the pictures of the said tunnel systemwhich appeared in my book The Gold of the Gods were taken by Moricz.The pictures are from Moricz, and I really have never been to the locationsshown in them. But that claim was never made in The Gold of the Gods. And in thephoto credits, it states clearly: photos by Juan Moricz. On the other hand, Idid have the opportunity to observe a small portion of the subterranean complexthrough a side entrance which—according to Moricz—is normally under water.Moricz told me, during my last visit to Ecuador in August, that what I had seenwas “nothing.” It was “derisory.” What he meant by “nothing” and “derisory” wasonly this small portion’s relationship to the cave complex as a whole. In thatsense, what I saw really was “nothing.” But to maintain that I did not visit theside entrance, or that what I wrote in The Gold of the Gods was pure fantasy, isinexcusable. I would have to be incredibly stupid to print the address of thevery person who could deny everything I claim in my own book! Furthermore, I didnot print a single one of my own pictures in The Gold of the Gods, although Ihave several in my possession. Juan Moricz asked me not to make anything publicwhich might reveal the location of the side entrance to people familiar with thearea. Finally, I would like to say that this entire speculation as to where Imight have been and what I saw there to be utterly ridiculous. The mostimportant question should surely be: Is it true? Does this tunnel system reallyexist? In this respect, it is Moricz who must make a definitive statement. It istoo late for him to backpedal and claim that the “zoological garden,” the table,the chairs and much more (that I have not yet written about) was simply afigment of his imagination. I refer you to the notary’s certificate of July 21,1969, from Dr. Gustavo Falconi, Guayaquil. (Document XVII)And maybe you should also ask him why he had his photograph taken with me andwhether the flashlights we had in our hands were just props.12[part0008.xhtml#ch02not12]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The rest of the letter refers to Father Crespi; I’ll get back to him later.Despite this clarification, the October 1, 1972, issue of Der Stern featured adevastating article about me. Moricz and Peña had apparently indignantly deniedeverything that I had written. I was knocked sideways. Only three weeks earlier,on September 12, 1972, I had received an extremely friendly letter—from Dr. Peñaof all people:I just received your letter of August 21. I wanted to let you know that Messrs.Hero Buss and Perry Kretz from the magazine “Stern” have been to Guayaquillooking for information for an article about your latest book. As ever, we werepleased to welcome them here and show them photographs of the subterraneanworld.13 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not13]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------That was exactly the opposite of what appeared in Stern. The magazine hadclaimed that Moricz and Peña had “opened the two German journalists’ eyes aboutErich von Däniken.” So, what happened to the truth? Did the Stern journalistssimply make up their story, or was the lawyer, Peña, lying to me? I sent twofurther letters to Ecuador, but received no answer, which didn’t surprise me allthat much as the Ecuadorian postal service wasn’t especially reliable. As ithappened, I had an acquaintance, Ms. Pia Buob, whose job as an airlinestewardess took her to Ecuador fairly frequently. I gave her a letter to take toDr. Peña and asked her to hand it over personally. Ms. Buob proved to be anexcellent messenger. She visited Peña in Guayaquil and dropped me a line:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Safely back in Switzerland, I thought I’d write you a quick note about my visitto Dr. Peña in Guayaquil.I went looking for Dr. Peña immediately after disembarking and gave him theletter that you had asked me to deliver. Dr. Peña was extremely nice to me; heinvited me into his house and introduced me to his family. They all wanted toknow how you were doing and spoke with great enthusiasm about you and yourvisits to Guayaquil.Dr. Peña was, however, horrified to read the Stern article that you enclosedwith your letter. His very words were: The whole article is a lie. Hisstatements to the “Stern” reporters had been twisted around and quoted out ofcontext. Dr. Peña promised me he would write to you on the subject as soon asJuan Moricz had returned from his trip to the caves. He wanted to speak toMoricz about it first.Dr. Peña and his family wanted to know when you are going to be returning toGuayaquil. They are looking forward to seeing you again, and they all send theirbest wishes.14 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not14]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------MORE DENIALSAfter reading this answer, I felt enormously relieved. The world was returningto normal, and it was all just exaggeration by the Stern reporters. Wrong! Thechaos was just beginning! German-speaking TV channels picked up the subject. Thehead of ECON, Mr. von Wehrenalp, was invited to take part in a TV debate withnoted ethnologist Professor Udo Oberem from Bonn. The scientist vehementlydenied that Crespi was in possession of any valuable treasures and that theworld had known of the Juan Moricz caves for some time. The ECON chief invitedthe scientist to take part in a research expedition to Ecuador—of course, withme and others in the party.15 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not15] Just one week later,Der Stern—which never published anything to exonerate me—reported that ProfessorOberem had rejected the offer to travel to Ecuador. Wrong again! Actually,Oberem had accepted the offer on October 12, 1972.16 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not16]The extremely conscientious head of the ECON publishing house in Düsseldorf,Erwin Barth von Wehrenalp, would have declared “open season” on me and wouldhave dropped me publicly, if my story in The Gold of the Gods had turned out tobe a patchwork of lies. Logically, he turned to the Ecuadorian ambassador inGermany, Professor Ramón Eduardo Burneo, and asked for his help in this delicatematter. He wanted the ambassador to identify scientists in Ecuador who could,together with Juan Moricz and me, clarify the situation. The publisher alsowrote:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I have been informed that you made certain negative statements regarding thebook by Erich von Däniken to the “Kölnischer Rundschau.” As we check everythingthat is reported to us, even rumors, I would be grateful if you could also letme know what the facts of the matter actually are….17 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not17]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The ambassador’s answer followed just one week later:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I would like to confirm that I would be prepared to help you with your efforts.In the meantime, I have contacted the relevant authorities in Ecuador and askedthem to name someone who might be an appropriate member of this expedition. Assoon as I heard back from them, I will let you know.I would also like to assure you that I have at no time made any statementswhatsoever about Mr. von Däniken’s book to any publication at all….18[part0008.xhtml#ch02not18]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------So what in heaven’s name was going on here? Clearly, journalists were making upnegative headlines that kept hitting me like hammer blows and providing myadversaries with ever more ammunition to shoot down my theories. And it washappening right across the world! The articles in Germany had been quicklypicked up by the press in the UK and the United States and were beingcannibalized to make even more sensational stories. The only problem was none ofit was true. But the newspaper editors in far-off lands couldn’t know that.Major newspaper and other publications were being quoted and being added topress archives. That’s how it works: journalists just dip in and helpthemselves. After all, you can’t expect an American journalist to startresearching everything from scratch—especially when it’s already been done bysomeone else. The American says to himself, “Well, the German is sitting righton the source of the story, so he must have better and more extensiveinformation than I could get hold of.” The system’s called ping-pong. Everyonetakes material from their counterparts.Following the friendly communication I had received from Dr. Peña and the visitby Ms. Buob to Ecuador, I wrote several long and detailed letters to SouthAmerica and asked for an explanation, such as this one from November 11, 1972,to Dr. Peña and Moricz:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------As you already probably know, following my assertion that there is a man-madetunnel system in Ecuador as well as a metal library, I have been torn apart bythe European press. During an interview on German television, my publisher atthe ECON publishing house in Düsseldorf announced that he would be prepared tofinance an expedition to Ecuador to prove the legitimacy of both my claims andyour “Escritura.”Professor Udo Oberem, from the department of American Studies at the Universityof Bonn, and I will fly from Germany to Ecuador. In Ecuador, a museum curatorand possibly also a geologist are to join the team. The planned undertaking musttake place at the beginning of March 1973.Unfortunately, none of us has the time to spend several months in the country,which rules out an expedition with mules and porters. Therefore, we feel thatthe best solution would be to fly to the cave entrance by helicopter. The costswill be paid by the ECON publishing house.1. Would it be possible for Señor Moricz, and would he be willing, to lead asmall expedition on or around March 1, 1973, by helicopter to the main entranceor one of the more interesting side entrances?2. Is Juan Moricz willing to show us/can he guarantee that the small expeditionwill get to see some of the man-made cave system? It only needs to be a smallpart which is indisputably artificial and could not have been formed by naturalwater erosion or subsidence.3. Is Señor Moricz willing to take us far enough so that we could see some ofthe underground treasures—in particular the metal library?Of course, it goes without saying that we expect Dr. Peña to accompany us onthis expedition. This short expedition has only one major aim and that is toascertain/confirm the existence of the underground cave system and the culturaland historical treasures to be found there. A major expedition, includingjournalists, is not planned until a later date. For the purposes ofverification, it is not absolutely necessary to fly directly to the mainentrance, as Señor Moricz also knows of side entrances. He could just as easilytake us to one of these, providing that we would still be in a position toconfirm that the system is man-made as well as see some of the subterraneantreasure.If Señor Moricz prefers not to take us to one of the side entrances, and wouldrather fly directly to the main entrance, then it is vital the Señor Moricz letsus know how long we are likely to need to remain underground in order to see atleast a part of the metal library. If necessary we will have send out a companyof porters in advance, or the helicopter will need to make several trips untilthe required team and their equipment is all delivered to the main entrance.The proposed helicopter mission would only possible for both Professor Oberemand myself on or around March 1, 1973. We are therefore relying on a quick andthorough response to the questions posed in this letter. As soon as the SeñorMoricz and Dr. Peña have confirmed that we will be allowed to view a part of theunderground system and the metal library, we will be in contact regarding thestructure and the planning of the trip.I send my best regards to you both and hope that we will see each other again,at the latest in March 1973.(Signed: Erich von Däniken)19 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not19]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------WAITINĢ IN VAINI waited and waited, sent four copies of the same letter to Ecuador—usingdifferent methods and routes each time. But there was no reaction. What could bethe reason for this lack of response? To be honest, I would have rather jumpedon the next plane to Guayaquil, but my schedule was completely filled withlecture tours for the whole of November and parts of December, too. Even a shortvisit to Ecuador would take at least five days, there and back, and I didn’thave five free days in a row anywhere. Christmas was on the doorstep, with allits family joys and duties. I convinced myself that Peña’s answer had been heldup in the Christmas post. But Professor Oberem and the others were pressing me.They needed a definitive answer, so they could make plans. So, on December 29,1972, I sent yet another letter across the ocean to Ecuador:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------On November 11, I sent you a long letter regarding plans for a helicopterexpedition to visit part of the underground cave system discovered by JuanMoricz. To make sure that it arrived, I sent four photocopies of the letter ondifferent days. In my letter of Nov. 11, I wrote that the ECON publishing housewould be willing to take on the costs of such an expedition and the Germanethnology professor Udo Oberem would be willing to accompany us.Now almost two months have gone past and I still haven’t heard any responseregarding my suggestions and questions. The situation is starting to getdifficult for me, if not to say impossible. Not only the expedition members, butalso the expedition sponsors—the ECON publishing house—are putting pressure onme…[then comes a section repeating, to a great extent, what was in the previousletter]…. Bearing in mind that travel expenses are quite significant, it isimpossible for us Europeans to come to Ecuador without any definitive assurancefrom Señor Moricz…. If I haven’t heard anything from you by January 10, 1973, Iwill try and contact you by telephone.20 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not20]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I spent New Year’s Eve 1972 with my family in a wonderful mountain hotel in theSwiss Alps. Many of the guests—some of them genuinely interested, some of themmocking—wanted to know more about the metal library in Ecuador. But I was unableto help them. Even the January 10th deadline that I had set for Peña passed bywithout any answer. The head of the ECON publishing house suggested that we justpack up our bags and head off to Ecuador, even without any undertaking fromMoricz. I was strictly against this idea, giving my reasons as follows:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------…the planned trip to Ecuador should and must take place. But the main reason forit is to visit the metal library. So we have to overcome this hurdle put up byMoricz and Peña. Even if our plans are delayed because of these two gentlemen,we should just calmly accept them and not get into a panic. We must inform allinterested parties in an objective and considered manner…. The fact that Moriczand Peña have still not answered does indeed worry me. Although I can say withsome degree of assurance that this silence is no personal affront aimed at me,because Ms. Buob visited Peña after the Stern report. I’m starting to wonder ifother parties have gotten involved in the matter—whoever that may be. Thosejournalists who attack me and tear me to pieces—and even the subject—don’t givea damn what we bring back from Ecuador if the tunnel system and the metallibrary are not part of it!21 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not21]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------What was important to me was to confirm the most important passages in The Goldof the Gods, and that was impossible without Moricz’s help. He was the keyfigure for my rehabilitation in the eyes of the world. Today—even after 36years—I can write all this and quote old correspondence without the slightesthint of bitterness and with no bad feelings towards those involved. Time healsall wounds, as we know. The reason for my disappointment back then was a verylong letter that I finally received from Dr. Peña (which is simply too long toquote here in full), which utterly devastated me. Was I living in some kind ofdream world? Or had the others changed sides? Peña wrote:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I received your letters of November 11 and 30, as well as that of December 29.In this respect, I must—as Señor Juan Moricz’s lawyer—inform you:….Señor Moricz and I both believed that you would return to Guayaquil at theearliest possible opportunity, to give us an explanation for the rather colorfuland inventive depiction of Señor Moricz’s discovery in your book [The Gold ofthe Gods), as well as regarding the publication of certain photographs andinformation for which you did not have our permission. Indeed, particularsregarding this discovery were given to you on the understanding that you wouldsponsor a further expedition to the sum of $200,000. This second expeditionwould then make the details of Moricz discovery available to the whole world….Contrary to any legal position, you have made use of the material provided toyou, although you were told from the very beginning that Señor Moricz wished toretain the express intellectual and authorship rights associated with thisdiscovery, as the certificate signed by all the members of the originalexpedition—which you have seen—guarantees. I enclose a copy for you….In this manner, you have usurped the right to publish the results of theaforementioned research. You have also commercially benefited from a discoveryand from information that belonged to another without even agreeing a fittingamount in compensation….By exploiting the commotion and natural human curiosity aroused by the story ofSeñor Moricz’s fantastic discovery, you intend to use your numerous publicationsto put us under pressure to organize a further expedition, from which you willexclusively benefit. You forget that the plan was to organize an expedition tobring Moricz’s discoveries before the eyes of the world, not from aphilanthropic desire to show everyone that Mr. Erich von Däniken was right. Youhave unlawfully aroused the curiosity of your readers for someone else’sdiscovery. Now you want to exploit the situation to prove that your assertionswere valid….22 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not22]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------FLABBERĢASTED!This blow totally floored me! For several days, I wandered around as if in adaze. Thank heavens I’m not the sort of type who suffers from depression; March’73 would have been the right month for it! I just didn’t know what to thinkanymore. I had only published a few pages about Juan Moricz’s discovery in TheGold of the Gods, because he (as well as I) had wanted it that way, and that wasso he would find it easier to publish his own book on the subject. He had givenme those black-and-white photos for exactly that purpose. They were claiming Ihad used them without permission. I was being portrayed as a completescoundrel—the whole way down the line—because I had “commercially benefited”from Moricz’s discoveries. Moricz was—so Peña’s letter claimed—also horrifiedabout the manner in which I had publicized his discoveries. In fact, I had shownhim the previews in Sie & Er and translated them word for word. Peña’s letteralso included a document that I—despite his assertion to the contrary—had neverseen before. I knew about the “Escritura” (the notary’s certificate), but I’dnever seen the following:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The undersigned, all members of the research expedition to the caves discoveredby Señor Juan Moricz in Ecuador, undertake not to publish any material orphotographs in a journalistic form, by radio or television, or any otherexplanations relating to the expedition, its incidents, or the valuable objectsin the caves, the geographical position of the site, the theories and hypotheseswhich led to the discovery, or any other particulars relating to the expedition.Any public or official statement to the mass media regarding the success,failure, repercussions, aims, realization and all other aspects of theexpedition, may only be made by Señor Juan Moricz, who is explicitly named asthe leader of the expedition, and expressly authorized to take legal actionagainst anyone who contravenes this agreement, as well as preventing thepublishing of any photographs or statements in breach of this agreement. Onlythe discoverer, Señor Juan Moricz, has the right to revoke the duties andrestrictions described in this document at such a time as he feels isappropriate.(Signed by hand by all of the members of the “Expedición 1969” on July 23,1969)23 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not23]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------It began to dawn on me that perhaps Moricz was being put under pressure from hisexpedition buddies, who had all been sworn to secrecy. In light of that, thisDäniken from Switzerland didn’t fit into the picture at all. He was spoilingeverything and earning piles of money (allegedly!) in the process. The reality,however, was quite different.Why am I raking up this old story now, after all these years? Who cares anymore?The Gold of the Gods is no longer on the market; my readers from back then areprobably all dead or interested in other things by now. And I have recoveredfrom all the shocks and traumas. So, why dig up this long done and dusted story?Because the metal library has been extensively viewed and described by anothersource! And because I now know the exact geographical location of the caveentrance! There are some pretty sensational discoveries right in front of us.The old story is suddenly highly topical again. Before I close the door on allthis 35-year-old correspondence, which in itself is a chapter in history, andbefore I tell you any more about the discovery of the metal library, it mightinterest you what became of the relationship between Moricz and Peña and myself.I answered Peña’s “hammer blow” just one week later (I have a hard shell!):--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The expedition that I proposed was purely intended to prove to the world thatthe metal library and other treasures really did exist and could be found in theMoricz caves. This was always only ever about Juan Moricz and not Erich vonDäniken…. It is not about proving that “Erich von Däniken was right,” rather itis a question of proving that what Moricz claimed, for instance in the“Escritura,” was true.During my visit to Ecuador last August, I showed you the first editions of themagazine “Sie & Er” and we spoke at length about the ways and means an authormust use to present his story. We made comparisons with products in a shopwindow that must be presented in the right light. Moricz said at the time thatthe means of presentation was only secondary. I would like to remind you that mybooks are not scientific treatises and that a writer must be given a littleartistic freedom.In your office, Señor Moricz gave me permission to use the photographs which hehad given me. This was indeed the very reason why we went to the photo lab andhad copies made. What’s more, any sudden secretiveness regarding these picturesis fairly pointless, seeing as they were all published in the Ecuadorian pressanyway.It is indeed true that I made an offer during one of our evening discussions torustle up some money for a further expedition, so that the world would find outabout the fantastic discoveries in Ecuador. This financing would have beenprovided by the ECON publishing house, and if that hadn’t panned out, I wouldhave spoken to some other company. If Señor Moricz thinks he can finance his ownexpedition then that is his affair, and I’m sure he has his own reasons fordoing it that way. But what I do find utterly unfair is to present me as somekind of villain who spilled the beans about secrets that were reserved for SeñorMoricz. I was not a member of the Expedición 1969 and not a signatory to thedocument you sent. What’s more, I had never had the slightest inkling that sucha document even existed. I would like to thank you for sending me a copy, by theway. Anyway, what the document refers to is not what we spoke about in Ecuador.It was clear to both you and Señor Moricz that I would write about thesubterranean tunnel system—that was, after all, the reason for our longmeetings.I would like to ask you, Dr. Peña, to think back to our conversations! You knowMoricz’s and my position on archeology and on the origin and proliferation ofHomo sapiens. You are also aware that Moricz and I both know much more than whatwe say and write. Do you remember our second dinner meeting? Moricz and I wereon exactly the same intellectual wavelength. On some of the subjects wediscussed, we only had to nod to each other, because each of us recognized thatthe other knew exactly what was being talked about. What do you think would havehappened if I had published the whole story? I can—especially after ourmeetings—not understand why you are both suddenly acting as if I had hurt you insome way. Moricz wants “la guerra,” or even “norte guerra!” But it was he whowanted to reveal the truth about human prehistory to a larger public. Moriczshould perhaps be grateful that people are not just talking about hisdiscoveries, but also about him. I have never claimed any of these discoveriesfor myself; I have always stressed that it was Moricz’s discovery. He has—Godknows!—no reason to be angry at me and my publications. If Juan Moricz is reallyin a position to realize his idea of publishing his planned book simultaneouslyin 30 languages, then it is in no small way down to the doors I have opened forhim. It is only through my publications that the world now knows that a tunnelsystem exists in Ecuador and that its discoverer knows its secrets.Dearest Dr. Peña, please accept my warmest regards and pass them on to SeñorMoricz.(Signed: Erich von Däniken)24 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not24]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE PLOT THICKENSBack then, from 1972 to 1975, a lot of people in the international press accusedme of not defending myself against these substantial accusations. They said Ihad done nothing to shed any light on the truth, had behaved poorly, and hadducked my responsibilities. In addition to that, somepeople—intentionally—slammed out headlines claiming I had admitted that I hadnever been in any caves in Ecuador. Humbug! At the very first press conference,I had made it extremely clear that I had not been to the main entrance to JuanMoricz’s subterranean world, but I had been in a side tunnel—which wasillustrated clearly by the photos. All the facts were thrown out of the windowto fabricate copy text such as: “Däniken admitted never actually being in thecaves in Ecuador.” These twisted articles are still coursing around the pressarchives and—of course—the Internet, where anyone can write what he or shepleases, even unmitigated lies. It reminds me of a TV host who wanted torestrict his guests to “yes” or “no” answers to questions that he asked. It’sabout the truth—and that can always be established with a yes or a no. Really?Take the following question and try and answer it correctly with a simple yes orno:Are you finally going to stop beating up your wife every evening?Yes or no?Do you get it? The either-or option often turns out to be a dud. It needsfurther explanation. That’s why I decided—as part of the continuing story of themysterious metal library—to finally clear up the controversy regarding those fewpages in The Gold of the Gods. And now I finally have the chance to tell how Iactually did try and shed some light on the whole matter.After my explanatory letter to Peña, I received an answer by return of postdemanding money. I was requested to pay “the corresponding percentage of theroyalties owed to Señor Moricz,” which I owed for income arising from the use ofthe photographs, research, and so forth. At the same time, I received a letterfrom a certain Mr. James B. Mobley from the “Media Associates Company,” a filmproduction firm in the United States of America, who announced that they wouldmaking a film about the subterranean caves in Ecuador and had secured therights. Señor Moricz had turned down the chance to be directly involved, but hispresence would not be necessary as a certain Señor Pino Turrola would be leadingthe team.25 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not25] To my astonishment I found out that SeñorTurrola had explored the caves more extensively than anyone else—and he had doneit one and a half years before the Moricz expedition! Mr. Mobley assured me inhis letter that his film company had drawn up a contract with the Ecuadoriangovernment and registered their rights with The Writers Guild of America. Butwhat electrified me the most was Mobley’s claim that the “panels made of strangemetals, gold objects, etc.” were not found in the Moricz caves; “rather theywere in a chamber many miles away. Its entrance can only be reached by swimmingthrough the river and up into the cave.”image [../Images/image00164.jpeg]image [../Images/image00165.jpeg]image [../Images/image00166.jpeg]image [../Images/image00167.jpeg]image [../Images/image00168.jpeg]That was news! If what Mobley said was true, then Moricz had had a notary’scertificate drawn up that bore no relation to the truth! It would mean that hehad abused the trust of his government and lied through his teeth to histrusting lawyer, Dr. Peña—and me, too! It also meant that the visit to the sideentrance was some sort of unfathomable charade. I sent a copy of the letter fromthe film company to Dr. Peña and also congratulated the film producer, Mr.Mobley, and assured him of my support in his endeavors in marketing the film. Inyet another long letter to Dr. Peña of March 16, 1973, I explained my standpointregarding Moricz’s demands (percentage share)26 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not26] butreceived no answer. Instead, a few months later, a demand for $1 million wasdelivered to my door. Unbelievable! Someone was suing me for a million bucks forjust a few pages in my book The Gold of the Gods. Those few pages related tojust a small portion of a wonderful story, which was quite possibly made up bythe person who was suing me (Juan Moricz) and who hadn’t lifted a finger toprove the truth of his tale—even though I had offered to finance his expedition!What the hell kind of world was I living in?On June 17, 1973, Mr. Ronald Nicholas, president of the National LeisureCorporation in Hollywood, told journalist Ron Thompson: “It’s unbelievable. Thefilm crew shot more than a thousand photos in the tunnels. They found cavernsthat were big enough to fit 5,000 to 6,000 people in.”27[part0008.xhtml#ch02not27]It was all right with me. Whoever turned up with the pictures would only beconfirming my story.Years went by. I challenged and beat Moricz’s claim for damages. He himselfcontinued to insist to newspapers and anyone who would listen that the caves andthe metal library existed.28 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not28],29[part0008.xhtml#ch02not29] Then, sometime in late fall 1976 (my archive numberis missing), the German magazine Bunte published a fabulous article aboutEcuador. An international team of explorers, led by Scottish cave explorerStanley Hall, had carried out a major expedition “in the footsteps of Erich vonDäniken.” Their guest of honor was the first man on the moon, Neil Armstrong.All of the participants were, it claimed, bitterly disappointed with me, as thesubterranean caves didn’t contain a hint of treasure. I had never heard of anycave explorer called Stanley Hall; Neil Armstrong, on the other hand, wassomeone everyone knows. I wrote him a letter on February 18, 1977, and asked formore details. A little over a week later, I had a reply. Mr. Armstrong distancedhimself from the press state-ment.30 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not30],31[part0008.xhtml#ch02not31] You can read Neil Armstrong’s letter for yourself.(See page 131 [part0005.xhtml#page_131].)THE TROUBLE WITH THE PRESSEven back then I’d given up asking myself what the hell was the matter with thepress. By then, I was well established as a full-blown victim of the system.Just read the letter! I knew, even then, how the media business worked and thatjournalists simply plundered existing sources to save time; that doesn’t makethem bad people. So, I was hardly even surprised when one of the major Germandailies published an article on October 2, 1982, about a German expedition—yetagain “on the Däniken trail”—that had traveled to Ecuador and carried out aninvestigation of the Tayos caves, easily reaching them without the assistance ofdozens of guides and porters, and who also only discovered brass panels andother kitsch in Father Crespi’s collection.32 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not32]image [../Images/image00169.jpeg]The letter I received from Neil Armstrong in 1977.But hadn’t the “Expedición Moricz 1969” needed a column of porters and evenmilitary protection? How did these German “tourists” simply manage to march upto the Tayos caves? The answer is simple: it was 12 years later, and theEcuadorians had built a road that ran almost the whole way there. The situationin 1982 just couldn’t be compared with 1969. And what about Father Crespi?Hadn’t it already been established some time ago that all he had in hiscollection was kitsch and modern junk?I was already aware back in 1972 that Father Crespi had worked for some time inhis earlier life as the curator of the gold museum in Cuenca. So, I hardly thinkthat he wasn’t in a position to tell what was gold and what wasn’t. The goldmuseum burned down on July 20, 1962. During my three visits to him in Cuenca,the old man had dragged out metal panels for the camera and said of almost allof them: “Oro…oro…oro.” (Gold…gold…gold.) The Father was an old rogue andenjoyed pulling his visitors’ legs. During my second visit, he was extremelykeen that I take a photo of his latest piece of “gold.” I happily did him thefavor, although I’m as capable as anybody of recognizing cheap brass. Then hedragged out a rusty old steam iron and told me, with a wink of his eye, thathere was proof that the Incas knew how to iron clothes. Extremely shrewd, afterearlier visits during which valuable artifacts had been stolen, he guarded histreasures jealously. He hardly let me get near to a single piece; and when Itried to take measurements he would hold up specimens at awkward angles or leantthem against the wall. What was I supposed to do? But to accuse the Father—don’tforget he was a respected member of the church and a gold expert—of lying wouldhave been too much. I had little choice but to note down his “gold” with asmile. This all the more, because I had been to the gold museums in Lima andBogotá, and they had had pieces that looked just the same as those in FatherCrespi’s collection.So, around 12 years after my visits, a bunch of German tourists wandered intoCrespi’s backyard. The Father had died a short time before and his successor wasall too happy to show the tourists with their fat backpacks all sorts of plunderfrom Crespi’s estate, including a couple of the panels that I had described as“gold.” Of course, all the valuable pieces from the collection had long sincebeen removed and were then housed in the Ecuadorian State Archive. Even so, Ican hardly imagine that those pieces were just “worthless junk,” as the Germanarticle had reported. You don’t need a vault to store old rubbish. I can wellimagine that many of the objects were duplicates: one genuine, one copy. I don’twrite this just to cover my own back, but from experience, as many of themuseums of the world contain imitations of other pieces. Even in the lands ofthe Andes.Anyhow, I wasn’t in a position to tell what was genuine and what was not, so Iwrote in my book The Gold of the Gods that the pieces were made of gold, silver,copper, and brass. In my next book, In Search of Ancient Gods, which waspublished just a year later, I was a little more specific: “brass, copper, cheapsheet metal, zinc, stone and wooden pieces…and in amongst all this confusionsome real treasures of gold, gold plate, silver and silver plate” (p. 149).33[part0008.xhtml#ch02not33] The labels underneath the photos were even morecautious: “metal panel” (p. 152), “gold-plated sheet metal” (p. 154),“sculpture” (p. 157), “silver-zinc disc” (p. 158), and “engraved silver sheets”(p. 160).34 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not34]Practically as soon as he got back, the leader of the German tourist group wrotea book refuting my story in which I was—of course, what else?—again “debunked,”“exposed,” and “refuted,” and we mustn’t forget the almost compulsory“indignation” on behalf of the German people.35 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not35] Allthat was missing were the dancing girls and fairy lights. The book talks as if Ihad constantly written about nothing but gold, gold, and more gold.” in FatherCrespi’s collection. For a start, it wasn’t true. Secondly, my photographicdocumentary book, In Search of Ancient Gods, was conveniently totally ignored.And thirdly, I couldn’t know that, between 1969 (Moricz) and 1982, theEcuadorians had built a drivable road through the jungle that would have made anexpensive expedition—as in Moricz’s times—completely unnecessary.The German tourists were quick to point the finger at some of Crespi’s panelsand “expertly” assess—on the basis of the insufficient weight alone—that theycould not be made of gold (Däniken exposed—hurrah!). I already knew back in 1972that the weight of an object had little to say about its gold content. ProfessorGebhardt, director of the Max Planck Institute for Metallurgy in Stuttgart, hadtold me: “Weight and color say little about the proportion of gold.”36[part0008.xhtml#ch02not36] Professor Gebhardt had been investigating themetallurgical expertise of the Incas for decades and was considered a topexpert. A few years later, Professor Heather Lechtmann, head of the Center forMaterials Research in Archeology and Ethnology at the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology, published an in-depth study on the “fake” Inca gold. The followingsentences appear in her report:In our laboratory, we analyzed small samples taken from finds. We found that thecoating was often only 0.5 to 2 micrometers thick and could hardly be perceived,even at a magnification of 500×…. The lords of the Inca empire used objects thatlooked like they were made of pure gold or silver…. The methods that thepre-Columbian inhabitants of America used for plating ignoble metals to givethem the appearance of precious metals have yet to be duplicated.37[part0008.xhtml#ch02not37]And what remains of these so-called “revelations” and the continual cry of“shame!”? Oh, yes! The motifs on Crespi’s artifacts.Archeologists are—at the end of the day—only human and sometimes look the otherway, or blurt out premature judgments when objects don’t fit into their schemeof things. The Crespi collection is a round peg in a square hole in thatrespect! It would completely destroy a highly popular preconception ofpre-Columbian culture that is perpetuated in countless reference books. Thequickest way to write off something like that is to hang the label “forgery” onit. Then nobody has to waste their time looking into it, especially students. Idon’t doubt that some of Crespi’s pieces were indeed modern, but for most ofthem this couldn’t be the case. They were stored up until July 20, 1962, in thegold museum in Cuenca and were classified as genuine and valuable. Then themuseum burned down. American archeologist Manson Valentine, an honorary curatorof the Museum of Science in Miami and a research fellow at the Bishop Museum inHonolulu, classified these very artifacts— the ones that I presented asphotographs in The Gold of the Gods—as “genuine.”38 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not38]And in the previous chapter, I showed you Crespi panels engraved with symbolsthat can also be seen thousands of miles from Ecuador. They’ll expect me tobelieve next that the Indios visited the little museum in Glozel (in France)before they got to work with their hammers and metal.I’ve got nothing against reasonable criticism, even when it sometimes goesagainst the grain. I myself am a member of numerous national and internationalwriters’ associations. I know countless journalists—my daughter is one ofthem—and have no problem sitting together with them to discuss the pros and consof a particular situation. I am happy to laugh around and philosophize with mycolleagues from the writing guilds. But I do have something against thisconstantly offended and indignant minority, which only takes the trouble tounderstand the absolute minimum of a life’s work necessary to be able to passjudgment on the rest of the things that they can’t actually be bothered to lookinto.AN HONORABLE SCOTSMANNow where is that metal library?The Gold of the Gods was published in Spanish with the title El Oro de losDioses in 1974 and unleashed a storm of controversy concerning the Tayos caves.(Just as a matter of interest: neither the English title, The Gold of the Gods,or the Spanish title, El Oro de los Dioses, came from me. Foreign titles werealways thought up by the publishing houses.) Anyway, the book inspired otherexpeditions on the trail of these contentious caves. Newspapers wrote reportsabout them,39 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not39] and the subterranean cave system wasdescribed, at least partially.40 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not40] One of those who hadbeen inspired by the tale told in my book was Mr. Stanley Hall. In 1994, I wasin Quito to give a lecture organized by the Swiss embassy and Germany’s GoetheInstitute. The next day I met up with Stan, as he calls himself, at his house.My former, longtime secretary and friend Willy Dünnenberger, who has lived inQuito for many years now, had organized the meeting. Stan, as I found out, wasof Scottish descent. I knew his name from the newspaper: it was he who hadgotten the Neil Armstrong expedition of 1976 off the ground. That expedition, hetold me, had only lasted a single day, as the entire team—including the firstman on the moon, Neil Armstrong—had been flown directly to the cave byhelicopter. Stan had known Juan Moricz for years, and of course his lawyer,Gerardo Peña. I told Stan my side of the tale, without referring to anydocuments of any kind, and Stan told me he was still hot on the trail of themetal library; the story was too fantastic to be allowed to get lost in themists of time. I thought much of Stan, both as a person whose word you couldrely on, and as a highly competent explorer. And I really believed that, ifanyone could find anything here in Ecuador, it would be him—all the more becausehe had a great reputation there and was also married to an Ecuadorian.During our conversation, Stan told me that he knew the geographical position ofthe metal library. It was not to be found in the Tayos Caves, he said. But itwas too early to go public with the information.Stanley Hall had doggedly remained on the trail for all these years and knew theexact position of the entrance to the metal library. He made no secret of itand—before his untimely death in 2008—published the mouthwatering and, in parts,painstaking tale in his book Tayos Gold: The Archives of Atlantis41[part0008.xhtml#ch02not41] (in which I appear almost as a kind of adoptiveuncle). Hall met up with the only eyewitness who had seen the metal library andthe other fantastic objects with his own eyes: Señor Lucio Petronio JaramilloAbarca. Petronio Jaramillo had been led into the phenomenal subterranean caveslong before Juan Moricz by an Indio of the Shuar tribe (previously known as the“Jívaros,” a tribe that had been somewhat infamous for its practice of makingshrunken heads from slain enemies). Due to severe erosion, the men were forcedto make their entry by diving into a river and swimming up into one of thecaves, where they spent the whole day and the following night examining thetreasure. Stan’s story of what he saw can be read from page 185 onward in hisbook. For reasons of copyright, but also out of respect to Stan’s many years ofresearch, I cannot simply quote these simply Earth-shattering revelations here.But I can say that Petronio talked of “thousands of animal carvings,” ofchimeras, of “crystal-like columns of various colors,” and finally of a metallibrary of many thousands of pages in which each “metal panel [was] around 40 ×20 centimeters large.”42 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not42] What Juan Moricz had told methat night in Guayaquil, a few extracts of which I have given you here in thisbook, is a mere trifle compared to the description by the eyewitness PetronioJaramillo.This subterranean world will provide us with revelations that will be a kick inthe teeth for some, but for others an enlightenment. But before that can happen,our so-called zeitgeist has to permit the metal library to come to light. It hasto allow research at a level that is only possible in scientific circles. Butwhich science? Conservative archeology, ethnology, and old-school theology? Inaddition to that, any group would need government assistance to carry out anextensive, large-scale expedition. Will they block it, maybe let themselves bebribed? Will they attempt to tell us—totally objective and deadly serious asever—that Stan Hall’s revelations and Petronio Jaramillo’s stories were justpure fantasy? I’m no big fan of conspiracy theories, but I know of two definitecases where this is exactly what has happened: the “Qumran Scrolls” found nearthe Dead Sea and the hidden chambers under the Great Pyramid. To prevent anypossible cover-up or secret exploitation of the caves, Stan Hall decided toreveal the exact position of the metal library. (Hello, Google Earth! Turn yoursatellite eye toward “1° 56’ 00” South, “77° 47’ 34” West!). But why is theeyewitness to this phenomenal treasure not all over our television screens?Petronio Jaramillo was gunned down in front of his own house in May 1998. Heleft behind a 14-year-old son, Mario.Stan Hall and Mario attempted to reach the entrance to the subterranean treasurechambers together, but, due to further erosion and other problems that Standescribed in his book, the team had to give up the effort just a short waybefore reaching their goal. If you believe the Internet, others have tried, too.Journalist Alex Chionetti claimed that he was prevented from reaching his goalby the Shuar tribesmen.43 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not43]And what about Señor Pino Turolla, who allegedly visited the caves one and ahalf years before Juan Moricz and had a film team with him? What happened to thefilm producer, James B. Mobley? Where are the thousands of photos that havesupposedly been shot down in this subterranean world? Stan Hall described PinoTurolla as a count of Italian origin who was searching for some proof ofextraterrestrial life. Heaven knows who he was working for. And whether heactually ever found anything to support his theories in the Tayos Caves, Icannot tell you. I met Mobley years later in Los Angeles, and asked him abouthis film and all the photos from the caves. He was friendly but tight-lipped,and said the film would never see the light of day, and neither would thephotos. “Why on Earth not?” I wanted to know, “Your company invested some hardbucks in that project.” He smiled smugly and explained somewhat ambiguously thathis company had got back a lot more money than it had invested. “From whom? Forheaven’s sake! I just don’t believe this!” Mobley held his tongue, thanked mefor the drink, and left.It’s meetings like this that really make me mad, without even getting onto thesubject of global conspiracies. And what about Juan Moricz? Surely, at least hemust have some interest in proving his story and blazoning it out to the world.Juan died on February 27, 1991, a short time before his 69th birthday. He hadagain discovered gold and never missed any opportunity to insist his story wastrue. How can that be? After it had been conclusively proven that the metallibrary wasn’t located in the Tayos Caves? The actual entrance lay around 100kilometers away from the Tayos Cave. What should I think of Moricz’s claims now?I have never judged him and remained, despite the problems that we had with eachother, of the opinion that he was a great man. He knew a huge amount—especiallyin my specialty area—was well read, and always behaved like a gentleman. Withthe benefit of hindsight, I can even understand why he reacted so angrily to myactions, especially after he was put under increasing pressure following thepublication of my book (he had similar problems with Stan Hall, and for the samereasons). Today, I believe that Juan Moricz’s caves most probably did containtreasure. These were—after the publication of The Gold of the Gods and becauseof the risk of treasure hunters—removed and put somewhere else. It cannot,however, be the same material that Petronio Jaramillo saw and described, as thatunique sighting took place before 1964. And the lawyer, Dr. Peña? A noble andhighly intelligent gentleman, thorough and neat, who did nothing more thanrepresent the interests of his client, Juan Moricz. How much of Moricz’s storyhe himself believed, I cannot say.A TWIST IN THE TALEThe explosive story of the metal library is only just beginning, thanks toStanley Hall! From his book and further conversations I had with him (he visitedme in Switzerland), I found out that a small expedition of Mormons had alreadyvisited the caves in 1968—one year before the Moricz expedition! Now’s the timeto prick up your ears! Let’s take a look back: the Mormons are descended fromthe Jaredites. Jared was Enoch’s father. He, you will remember, wrote down booksthat were dictated to him by extraterrestrials and handed them down to his sonsto be preserved for future generations. Led by a “god,” the Jaredites reachedthe South American coast after 344 days in eight windowless boats. The Mormonbooks of Ether and Levi describe this in detail. What do these ancestors oftoday’s Mormons—or the descendents of Jared—have to do with the writings on themetal panels? A few quotes from the Book of Mormon reveal that it was exactlythis type of metal panel that they carried. Before the journey over the greatocean, the panels had to be secured: (Words and numbers in parentheses indicatethe book and chapter in the Book of Mormon.)(Nephi 3:3) For behold, Laban hath the record of the Jews and also a genealogyof my forefathers, and they are engraven upon plates of brass. (3:4) Wherefore,the Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy brothers should go unto the houseof Laban, and seek the records…. (3:24) And it came to pass that we went in untoLaban, and desired him that he would give unto us the records which wereengraven upon the plates of brass, for which we would give unto him our gold,and our silver, and all our precious things. (4:16) And I also knew that the lawwas engraven upon the plates of brass. (4:17) And again, I knew that the Lordhad delivered Laban into my hands for this cause—that I might obtain the recordsaccording to his commandments. (5:10) And after they had given thanks unto theGod of Israel, my father, Lehi, took the records which were engraven upon theplates of brass, and he did search them from the beginning. (5:11) And he beheldthat they did contain the five books of Moses, which gave an account of thecreation of the world, and also of Adam and Eve, who were our first parents.(5:18)…that these plates of brass should go forth unto all nations, kindreds,tongues, and people who were of his seed. (5:19) Wherefore, he said that theseplates of brass should never perish; neither should they be dimmed any more bytime…. (5:22) Wherefore, it was wisdom in the Lord that we should carry themwith us, as we journeyed in the wilderness towards the land of promise.44[part0008.xhtml#ch02not44]The book tells of “brass plates,” although we should perhaps not take the wordbrass too literally. After all, these plates were intended to survive formillennia (and not be dimmed any more by time). The word brass may have comeabout simply as a result of the translation or to protect the real truth. If thetranslator had, for example, used the word gold, then the desirability of theseplates would have been increased manifold. And anyway, only a microcoating ofgold would have been necessary. Think back to the phenomenal metal-processingtechniques of the pre-Columbian Incan tribes who, after all, must have learnedtheir skills from somewhere or someone. Anyhow, these brass plates containedaccounts “of the creation of the world, and also of Adam and Eve, who were ourfirst parents.” And they were to be distributed “unto all nations, kindreds,tongues, and people.” Obediently, the Jaredites dragged these importantchronicles with them across the sea to America. And once in America, the numberof plates increased as ever new accounts were added:(Nephi 9:4) Upon the other plates should be engraven an account of the reign ofthe kings, and the wars and contentions of my people…. (9:5) Wherefore, the Lordhath commanded me to make these plates for a wise purpose in him, which purposeI know not. [author’s underlining]45 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not45]So, new plates were constantly being added to the old ones and—as the secondbook of Nephi describes, from Chapter 13 onward—copies were also being made ofboth old and new plates using “ore.” The collection grew and because Nephi’sdescendents also wrote their history on metal plates, the metal library of theascendents of today’s Mormons must have consisted of thousands upon thousands ofplates.A FANTASTIC VOYAĢEPetronio Jaramillo, the murdered eyewitness to the subterranean treasures, toldnot only of engraved panels, but also of inexplicable things such as, accordingto Hall’s Tayos Gold, “crystal-like columns of various colors.” He alsomentioned a kind of artificial light and colored stones, as well as mysteriouswalls that were “crystal in appearance.” Pomposity? Now, hold on a minute!The Jaredites crossed the ocean in eight ships. But what were these vesselsactually made of?(1 Nephi, 18:2) Now I, Nephi, did not work the timbers after the manner whichwas learned by men, neither did I build the ship after the manner of men; but Idid build it after the manner which the Lord had shown unto me; wherefore, itwas not after the manner of men. [author’s underlining]46[part0008.xhtml#ch02not46]Boats that are not made using human methods—in other words, “terrestrial”methods—can only have been made using extraterrestrial methods. These would mostprobably have included new materials, joins, alloys, and tools that men did notknow at that time. But the ETs did! Petronio Jaramillo saw these kinds of alloysand compared them crystal and quartz. It can hardly have been phantom ships, asI’m sure some clever psychologists will attempt to argue. The boats werecompletely watertight and totally storm-resistant. And where did the artificiallight and the other things that Petronio described come from?(1 Nephi 16:10) And it came to pass that as my father arose in the morning, andwent forth to the tent door, to his great astonishment he beheld upon the grounda round ball of curious workmanship; and it was of fine brass. And within theball were two spindles; and the one pointed the way whither we should go intothe wilderness…. (16:16) And we did follow the directions of the ball, which ledus in the more fertile parts of the wilderness.47 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not47]This curious ball seems to be more than just a compass. It also carries outother vital functions.(1 Nephi 16:26) And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord said unto him:Look upon the ball, and behold the things which are written. (16:27) And it cameto pass that when my father beheld the things which were written upon the ball,he did fear and tremble exceedingly….48 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not48]A flying, speaking, and picture-producing ball. How come the “Lord” didn’t makeit all a little bit simpler? Wasn’t he capable? All these mysteriousobjects—compass, speaking ball with integrated holographic functions—helped theJaredites in their journey across the ocean. And the artificial light thatPetronio Jaramillo claimed to have seen?After the Jaredites had built their unique vessels with the help of their“Lord,” they realized that it was going to be pitch black inside them:(Ether 2:18) And it came to pass that the brother of Jared cried unto the Lord,saying: O Lord, I have performed the work which thou hast commanded me, and Ihave made the barges according as thou hast directed me. (2:19) And behold, OLord, in them there is no light; whither shall we steer? And also we shallperish, for in them we cannot breathe, save it is the air which is in them…. 49[part0008.xhtml#ch02not49]Simple problems like this were easy for the “Lord” to solve. He created shiningstones (see Ether 6:2), 16 of them in all, and gave them to the Jaredites.(Ether 6:3) And thus the Lord caused stones to shine in darkness, to give lightunto men, women, and children, that they might not cross the great waters indarkness.50 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not50]To make sure that his people had fresh air to breathe, he had them drill specialholes that would let in air but kept out water. Today, we called them nonreturnvalves. Technically flawless. There is even an explanation for the luminousstones. Certain chemicals, when brought into contact with oxygen, begin to glow.In the subterranean rooms visited by Petronio Jaramillo the air was admittedlydamp but nonetheless pleasant. In other words, there was enough oxygen tosustain a long-term chemical reaction. The “stones of the Lord” are stillworking thousands of years later. Petronio Jaramillo didn’t make it up.It all seems a bit much, all these things we are suddenly being confronted with.But there is a certain logic behind it all. I would like to help to encircle allthese mysterious facts and expand on them by applying today’s standard ofknowledge. The consequences of this will be compelling—and uncanny at the sametime.In the book Ether in the Book of Mormon, Jared’s brother reveals that he hasbeen ordered to hide the engraved plates again (Ether 4:3), and he continues:(Ether 4:4) Behold, I have written upon these plates the very things which thebrother of Jared saw; and there never were greater things made manifest thanthose which were made manifest unto the brother of Jared. (4:5) Wherefore theLord hath commanded me to write them; and I have written them. And he commandedme that I should seal them up; and he also hath commanded that I should seal upthe interpretation thereof….1 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not51]This revelation by Ether (which is why it is known as the Book of Ether) is notreferring to those metal plates that were first written in the Americas, butexpressly to the original plates:(Ether 1:3) …the first part of this record, which speaks concerning the creationof the world, and also of Adam, and an account from that time even to the greattower, and whatsoever things transpired among the children of men until thattime, is had among the Jews. (1:4) Therefore I do not write those things whichtranspired from the days of Adam until that time; but they are had upon theplates; and whoso findeth them, the same will have power that he may get thefull account. [author’s underlining]52 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not52]The plates are to be hidden—and are consequently dutifully concealed. By whom?By Moroni, a person who lives long after the Jaredites. He tells us this inperson: “I am the son of Mormon…” (Mormon 8:13).53 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not53]And what does he do?(Mormon 8:14) And I am the same who hideth up this record unto the Lord; theplates thereof are of no worth, because of the commandment of the Lord. For hetruly saith that no one shall have them to get gain; but the record thereof isof great worth; and whoso shall bring it to light, him will the Lord bless.54[part0008.xhtml#ch02not54]The circles get smaller; the conclusions more convincing. But we are stilllacking the last drop of color to transform this portrait into a grand master.It is Moroni who closes the loop. Following the instructions of his “Lord,” hetells us that the treasure will come “out of the earth.” And as the icing on thecake, he even tells us approximately when.(Mormon 8:16) And blessed be he that shall bring this thing to light; for itshall be brought out of darkness unto light, according to the word of God; yea,it shall be brought out of the earth, and it shall shine forth out of darkness,and come unto the knowledge of the people…. (8:26)…and none can stay it; and itshall come in a day when it shall be said that miracles are done away; and itshall come even as if one should speak from the dead. (8:29) Yea, it shall comein a day when there shall be heard of fires, and tempests, and vapors of smokein foreign lands; (8:30) And there shall also be heard of wars, rumors of wars,and earthquakes in divers places.55 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not55]Let me recapitulate:image [../Images/image00170.jpeg] Two extraterrestrials (“the like of which Inever saw on earth”) disinfect Enoch with a wonderfully smelling paste and dresshim in new clothing.image [../Images/image00170.jpeg] They bring him to a mother ship.image [../Images/image00170.jpeg] He learns to write and is given “a reed ofquick-writing.” Many books are dictated to him.image [../Images/image00170.jpeg] Before he finally leaves the Earth, he passeson these books to his brother and sons “for the generations after the flood.”image [../Images/image00170.jpeg] Enoch’s books are hidden.

The old plates are probably duplicated here.image [../Images/image00170.jpeg] Joseph Smith receives an order to translatethese plates. (I will attempt to show how this may have been possible later.)The result is the Book of Mormon, the “bible” of the Church of Jesus Christ ofLatter-day Saints.image [../Images/image00170.jpeg] This book tells us that the metal library issafely hidden, but will come to light when it can be said that “miracles aredone away” (that is, they have ceased). It will also be a time of “fires, andtempests, and vapors of smoke in foreign lands” and “wars, rumors of wars, andearthquakes in divers places.”image [../Images/image00170.jpeg] The writings on the metal plates will come tothe people “even as if one should speak from the dead” (in other words, as ifthe dead were telling their story).image [../Images/image00170.jpeg] A metal library is discovered in Ecuador,complete with artificial light and other wonders.image [../Images/image00170.jpeg] The eyewitness Petronio Jaramillo describesthe details of the fantastic subterranean cave system, including a library madeof metal.image [../Images/image00170.jpeg] A small group of modern Mormons visit theTayos Caves in Ecuador in 1968 in the hope of discovering the legacy of theirforefathers, the Jaredites.Strange, to say the least. Joseph Smith, the founder of the Mormon faith, couldnot have known—back in 1827—anything about a subterranean metal library inEcuador, and certainly nothing about the Babylonian creation epic Enüma Eliš, inwhich the same shipbuilding story is described as in the Book of Ether.SO, WHO IS GOD?The reality is more fantastic than the fantasy. Once again—like in the earlierbooks—we are forced to ask the question, who is or were the god or gods thatmoved among us all those millennia ago? As a religious man who still praysdaily, my faith begins with the creation of the universe. My idea of God is ofan eternal, omnipresent, timeless, and almighty being who would never feel theneed to cruise around Earth in any kind of vehicle that throws up sand, makes alot of noise, radiates blazing light, and, what’s more, is extremely dangerousto any human in the vicinity (see Genesis or the prophet Ezekiel in the OldTestament). I know intelligent works by philosophers and theologians on “God,the being,” but none of them have created a satisfactory definition of God. (Ifanybody is interested in my theories about what God is, refer to my book TheGods Were Astronauts.)Independently of the “Great Spirit of Creation,” as I describe God, certainbeings were clearly active on Earth many thousands of years ago and mankindbelieved them to be gods. The psychological explanation that our “simple”forefathers had mistaken mighty forces of nature for divine visitations fallsapart at the latest when these gods start speaking, giving instructions, orimparting astronomical or technical knowledge that those millennia-old humansocieties could not have had a clue. Or was it simply a force of nature thathanded over the “a reed of quick-writing”? Then disinfected him, dressed him,and transported him in a fiery chariot into the clouds? And then dictated to himinformation on the phases of the moon and the paths of the sun? Was it thestorm, the silent stars in the firmament, the blinding lightning from the blackclouds that taught our ancestors—who themselves had only just come down from thetrees—how to write? And who was this idiosyncratic god followed by the Jarediteswith their metal plates?If the Great Spirit of Creation had wanted to relocate a group of people to adistant continent—what we now know as America—then why would he need to botherwith the tedious process of building eight tiny ships? Wouldn’t the almighty Godof humankind have been able to simply spirit them there with a wave of his handor a mere thought? Or—as it is written in Sura 2, verse 117 of the holyQur’an—“when He wills a thing to be, He but says unto it, ‘Be’—and it is.” Didthe “Lord” of the Jaredites really have no divine powers? The fact that heshipped the Jaredites and their metal library across the ocean in those small,handmade vessels seems to indicate this. Why did the “Lord” need to providetechnical instructions on how to construct the boats? And did he simply forgetabout the need for lighting and ventilation, so that he needed to be remindedabout it by the humans? Even if the god of the Jaredites simply didn’t feel likeperforming wonders; even when he specifically wanted his people to work hard fortheir own redemption, it remains incomprehensible why he didn’t provide plansfor a more significant vessel, such as Noah’s Ark. And if it had to be shipslike watertight nutshells, couldn’t the eternal god of winds and clouds have atleast managed to conjure up some calm seas for his travelers? It is all rathervexing and full of contradictions. Was the god of the Jaredites deliberatelytrying to provoke the question: why technology and not miracle? Why thisdangerous journey over stormy waters? Would the “Lord” have been able tointervene if his people had really gotten into trouble?The contradiction between the concept of the Great Spirit of Creation (= God)and the deified figures of ancient writings is clear. My small intellect drivesme to search for these gods of antiquity, because they were clearly here andthey left a significant mark. The conclusion for anyone knowledgeable in thefield—and here I include myself after my 50 years of research and 30 books onthe subject—is absolutely certain. If you bore for long enough, you leave ahole. Apparent answers, half-truths, and the lies from the literature simplywon’t do anymore. Curiosity is an untamable beast that, even on its deathbed, isstill looking for the next answer. It asks and asks and asks: How was it backthen? Why did that happen? Who were these gods that so impressed early man thatworld religions arose from it? One thing can be said for sure: the gods of themajor religions didn’t appear in fairy costumes and conjure people from oneplace to another with their magic wands. Admittedly, the ancient gods did seemto fly around the place, from one country to another, and occasionally—theindividual cases are documented—even took human passengers. However, they nevertook entire peoples in their flying monstrosities. But this is all technology,not miracles. Why? Did these so-called gods not have any access to thephenomenal possibilities available to the Great Spirit of Creation? Or are allthese holy books, including the Book of Mormon, simply fabrications?The Vatican recently announced that the Roman-Catholic Church is the only truechurch of Jesus Christ, and the Protestant and Evangelical churches “are notchurches in the true sense”56 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not56] (statements like thiscrop up on a regular basis—every few decades or so). On the Dienstags Club(Tuesday Club), a program on Swiss TV, I recently watched a debate betweenCatholic and Evangelical theologians. The Catholic, clearly highly schooled intheological matters, explained how the statements made by the Roman-Catholiccongregation were to be understood, and the Protestant clergyman defendedecumenism and insisted that all Christian communities lived according to thesame gospel and the teachings of Jesus Christ, the founder of Christianity.Heavens above! Do they not know, or do they simply not want to know, anythingabout the “urtexts” and the millennia-old deception of these gospels?Is it the same story with the chronicles of Ether and Levi in the Book ofMormon? Are these metal plates, which were supposedly written thousands of yearsago, simply a figment of someone’s imagination? A holy lie? Who is this JosephSmith anyway? And how did he discover and translate the plates?JOSEPH SMITHAmong the hordes that made their way to the New World during the great waves ofimmigration that took place 180 years ago was a Scottish family with eightchildren that settled in Palmyra in New York State. The area that the Smithssettled in was right on the edge of civilization, where they faced a hard dailystruggle just to get by. The new arrivals from Europe were a hardworking bunch:they brought not only tools and an impressive work ethic with them, but alsonumerous religious views, which they attempted to spread with missionary fervor.New sects and religious groups sprang up everywhere. Apostles of salvation fromcountless faiths preached on street corners, overtrumped each other with theboldest of promises during battles of words, and often attempted to capture thesouls of believers with grim threats from beyond. Chapels, temples, and churchesshot out of the ground like mushrooms, just as if the devil himself had justarrived in town to confuse the spirits of the settlers. Mother Smith and threeof her children joined the Presbyterians. Son Joseph, now 18 years old, had hisproblems, however. He was searching in desperation for a true God, because hedid not want to accept the way that all the redeemers were so unshakablyconvinced that they were right and at the same time were willing to fight to thedeath in Jesus’ name. Joseph Smith was a nobody until that fateful night ofSeptember 21, 1823, when he experienced his strange visions. It then took fouryears, until September 22, 1827, until God’s messenger Moroni finally deliveredthe metal plates to him. Who was this angelic Moroni? The son of Mormon, andMormon was one of the descendents of the Jaredites who had put out across theocean all those thousands of years ago. So how could Moroni, who in 1827 wasalready long dead, have appeared to Joseph Smith? Where did the metal platescome from that Smith subsequently discovered in the hill called Cumorah near thevillage of Manchester in the United States? And which depot did the mysteriousmetal library—and the other treasures—in far-off Ecuador suddenly come from?The fact that the metal plates really existed is at least not legallycontestable, as 11 other men also attested to their existence in a signeddocument. In addition to that, the Book of Mormon is filled with such extensivedetails about family disputes, wars, migrations, genealogies (the sequence ofthe generations with their countless offshoots), with complicated names,confusing quotes, landscapes and locations and so on, that it seems highlyunlikely that a single person could have made it all up during his life. JosephSmith only lived another 17 years following his visions! As a comparison, thetexts of the Old Testament took hundreds of years to compile.AN ALTERNATIVE INTERPRETATIONFor a possible solution to these countless contradictions, I need to dive downinto a somewhat fantastic reality:A group of extraterrestrials refuses to follow the orders of their commander,the “Most High,” the “Great Glory” as he is called in the Book of Enoch. Thathappened thousands of years ago. These extraterrestrials, called “fallen angels”and “watchers of heaven,” come down and have their wicked way with the Earthgirls and some of them start families. Several names and trades of these beingsare known, and they are listed by Enoch. The “Great Glory” causes a flood tocome over the Earth—presumably caused by some technological means, such as anH-bomb over a polar ice cap, or the targeted crashing of a meteorite. The groupof mutineers recognizes the danger and some of them manage to bring themselvesto safety and survive. On Earth a “war of the gods” begins, as it is describedin numerous myths and legends. In reality, it is simply a power struggle betweenthe remaining mutineers, because each of them wants a bigger slice of the pie.These survivors—not exactly known for the gentleness of their methods—want to beserved. They require minerals, ores, nourishment, and so forth. All the dirtywork is done by humans, of course. In their naivety, they believe their bossesto be gods. “Thou shalt have no other Gods before me!” says the Bible. Priestcastes are established; no one may approach “God” lest he be exquisitely cleanand offer up sacrifices (nourishment).The mutineers no longer have access to their high-tech weaponry; it all remainson board the mother ship of the “Most High.” However, they can still use theirknowledge. Nobody can take that away from them. Every single member of the teamknows, for instance, how to construct a hot air balloon—as is attested in theEthiopian Kebra Negast, the Book of the Glory of Kings.57[part0008.xhtml#ch02not57] They all know how a laser works, which chemicals youneed to make explosives, or which mixtures of ores result in a durable alloy.And they use this knowledge to impress mankind.One of these pseudo-gods, or one of his best-trained descendents, has carriedout reconnaissance flights and has discovered a distant, uninhabitedcontinent—what we now know as America. He sends a group of his followers there,commanding that they take the ancient metal plates with them. These are thepanels upon which the entire history of mankind since the creation—since Adamand Eve—is engraved. This being, called “Lord” by his terrestrial disciples, nolonger has the technological wherewithal to transport larger groups of peopleand their animals as well as a whole bunch of metal plates across the ocean. Sohe makes them build ships, helping them with technical assistance as and when itoccurs to him.Why bother? What does this “Lord” want with all these metal engravings? And whatuse is it to him to have a people in America that is not likely to developadvanced technology for thousands of years?Hold on a minute! There’s a contemporary explanation for everything. Whetherit’s right or not will be confirmed when we read the contents of Ecuador’s metallibrary. The “Lord’s” actions are all part of a plan, a thousand-year plan. Todigest that a little better, we need to make a little intellectual detour:How do we warn our descendents in 10,000 years about the dangers of one of ournuclear waste dumps? Around a quarter of a century ago, the Nuclear RegulatoryCommission at the U.S. Department of Energy set up a special committee, the“Human Interference Task Force,” specifically to look at this question. ThomasSebeok, back then one of the world’s leading semioticians, recommended placingmassive warning signs at the dumps. As nobody is likely to understand today’slanguage in 10,000 years (the time it takes before nuclear waste is safe), thegroup opted for a communications mix of symbols, graphics, and pictograms. Theexperts also suggested exploiting the human inclination toward superstition: theplaques also contain cryptic warnings so that the people of the future believethat any ingression onto the sites would be “tantamount to inviting some sort of‘supernatural act of retribution.’”58 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not58] The Germanperiodical Der Spiegel noted at the time: “As such warnings tend rather toattract rather than dismay the curious, Sebeok also recommended seeding theground around the site with the disgusting smell of long-lasting stink bombs.”59[part0008.xhtml#ch02not59] Other researchers in the group suggested using“nuclear sirens” that would give off stored radiation, even in many thousands ofyears to come. Or a genetically altered cat which, due to the radioactivity,would have a glowing violet-yellow pelt. Myths and tales would transport themessage of the “glowing cat” over 10,000 years.60 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not60]Berlin’s Professor of Semiotics, Roland Posner, claimed that society needed tobe prepared for “future planning at an unprecedented level.”61[part0008.xhtml#ch02not61]So, what if this is just rehashing an old problem? In January 1980, a gatheringof Indio priests and shamans from various parts of the world took place inMontréal, Canada. The representative of the Yanomano tribe from Venezuelareported:In the area where my people live, there are many mountains. These are holyplaces for us. One of them we call “The Bear,” another “The Monkey,” and a third“The Bird.” Long before the white men came, our medicine men regularly madepilgrimages to these mountains. No one else was allowed to visit these sites.The mountains were the source of great power, and the old wise ones of ourpeople spoke of a dangerous material that lay hidden there. Our tradition saidthat if these mountains were ever destroyed, a great misfortune would fall uponour people.62 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not62]In the meantime, the Venezuelan government has discovered large deposits ofuranium in these very mountains. Where did the wisdom of the Yanomano peoplecome from? Only religions can transport messages over hundreds of generations.And for that very reason, Thomas Sebeok, the head of the “Human InterferenceTask Force,” suggested setting up a kind of atomic priesthood to protect ourdescendents. Only an elite priesthood or some kind of Masonic committee would bein a position to transmit knowledge down through the generations over thousandsof years. Faith, lack of actual knowledge, and an inability to recognize thetruth, as well as the constant threat of some kind of divine retribution, wouldkeep the message alive. It’s already been proven by our religions today.Non-knowledge, fear, and the priesthood make the unthinkable possible. It’s beengoing on for millennia. We could all be wrong about the origins of ourreligions. If faith, including the Book of Mormon, is being used as a vehicle toproject a message from extraterrestrials into our present age, then we must lookforward to new insights. They may be—although it’s not necessarilyinevitable—quite shocking. It’s all a question of viewpoint. We are in theprocess of trying to convey our warning about the dangers of nuclear waste intothe distant future. Why couldn’t others, in Enoch’s time, have attempted thesame thing?THE INERTIA OF “COMMON SENSE”We are part of a society of “yes” men (and women). Some agree to everythingbecause of their religious convictions, others because they simply don’t knowany better, and yet others for purely the opposite reason. No excuse is toooutlandish, as long as our feelings of self-esteem are never in danger. We haveall prepared something for ourselves and react in a surly manner if anythingtries to topple our safe little ivory towers. The very idea of aliens isrejected at the outset because healthy human reason tells us: a) they don’texist, b) if they did they’d be completely different from us, and c) they’d beso far away that they could never reach us anyway. Anyone who thinks that way isjust afraid of looking the facts in the eye. Just like the famous quote fromscientist Dr. Lee De Forest, who claimed as late as 1957: “Man will never reachthe moon, regardless of all future scientific advances.”63[part0008.xhtml#ch02not63] Just 12 years later, on July 20, 1969, Apollo 11landed on the moon. He wasn’t alone. Sir Harold Spencer Jones, the famousBritish astronomer and head of the Greenwich Royal Observatory, (in)famouslyclaimed that “space travel is bunk” a mere two weeks before the Sputnik launchin 1957.The story of science teaches us that even the most respected minds have backedabsurd theories. There are many delightfully amusing books on the subject!64[part0008.xhtml#ch02not64] In the second century before Christ, the famousAlexandrian astronomer Ptolemy taught his students: “I would like to make itclear: the Earth is the center of the universe and all other heavenly bodiesrevolve around it.”65 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not65]Scientists can contest the errors of their own trade. Science is alive,adaptable, and willing to learn—unlike religion. Religions behave like theproverbial three monkeys: the first covers its eyes, the second covers its ears,the third its mouth. Despite their lack of knowledge, they constantly raise awarning finger. They want to be instructive and well-meaning. Who is there towarn us against well-meaning people?As a specialist for extraterrestrials I know—no, let me say, I believe—thataliens visited the Earth thousands of years ago. This led to the birth oftoday’s religions and holy scriptures. As we know, every religion in thisearthly madhouse claims that its holy scriptures are the only true ones. Who—forGod’s sake!—should we believe? And what should we believe in? Most religionsprophesy some kind of final judgment. There are religions that announce that theunbelievers will be boiled alive, drowned, beaten down, stabbed, poisoned (with“bitter water”), shot, crushed in earthquakes, or wiped out by some other kindof plague. Luckily, this only applies to the unbelievers—but wait! Whichunbelievers? Those who don’t believe in Catholic dogma? Those who had themisfortune not to be born in Arab or Asian lands, and have never heard eitherthe teachings of Islam or the Hindu faith? Those who were unlucky enough to growup in a Christian or other sect? Those who are members of the Shinto religion inJapan, or those who don’t believe in the Book of Mormon or the teachings ofScientology?Even the most modestly intelligent brain must surely begin to see the problem.The real God, the Great Spirit of Creation, is not responsible for the grandmishmash of earthly religions and dogmas. On the other hand, thesereligions—along with their holy books—are still around. If we absolve the GreatSpirit of Creation from all this—for he would surely be infallible and wouldnever need to make later corrections to any mistakes he might have made, becausehe would never set people at each others’ throats or tell every religion thatonly they were right—then who can we blame? The texts are there: the OldTestament, the Torah, the Bible, the Book of Mormon, and many more. As we canhardly hold the creator of the universe responsible for the plethora of holywritings that exist on our planet, then we must surely look for another sourceto find a halfway acceptable solution to the chaos that exists. The alternativeis just to throw all of the holy scriptures into the garbage. But that justwon’t do. Then we would be accusing every prophet from Enoch to Joseph Smith ofincessant lying—for they write in the first person, from personal experience.And we would also be ignoring all the technical, medical, and astronomical datain these ancient texts. Dictated directly from some kind of “God” or “Lord.” Tooembarrassing!If all these ancient religious texts were inspired, or at least partiallyinspired by extraterrestrials, the questions have to be: Where on Earth are theynow? Or where off Earth? If the “Lord” of the Book of Mormon was only laying aslow-burning fuse that only thousands of years later was intended to ignite anintellectual explosion, what kind of game was he playing? What did he have togain? I am far from being the only person who is asking these kinds ofquestions. In the English-speaking world there are countless publications on thesubject. The scientific treatises regarding the ETs’ strategies are dominated byprofessors Bracewell and Deardorff.66 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not66],67[part0008.xhtml#ch02not67],68 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not68]A HUMAN ZOOThere is a hypothesis that claims that the Earth is seen as some kind of refugeby the extraterrestrials, a kind of “zoological garden.” The most importantprecondition for a well-functioning zoo is the well-being of both the keepersand the zoo visitors. So the visitors are forbidden from destroying the nestingsites of rare birds, feeding live dogs to crocodiles, teasing the lions, orremoving poisonous snakes. And all visitors are required to abide by the rules.The animals are only there to be admired and to be studied from a distance. Thekeepers, for their part, are there to make sure that everyone plays by therules.Now in this case, the keepers know that one species is more intelligent than theothers. This species—mankind—is capable of philosophical thinking, ofabstraction, of creating various cultures and technologies. The keepers alsoknow that it’s only a question of time until mankind tries to break out of itszoo. Should they let man break out? Could he be a danger to the keepers and thezoo visitors?As humans, we do not (yet) know how many galactic civilizations there might beout there. We cannot exclude the possibility that they include aggressivesocieties. Maybe there are extraterrestrial beings that have a completelydifferent metabolism to us, or have a body structure and lifecycle that is morelike an insect. Quite possibly, such a being would not think much of us at all.Perhaps there is even an extremely aggressive, manlike civilization out therethat has won in an interstellar war and is in the process of carrying out somekind of expansion policy fueled by this aggression. It’s quite plausible thatthere are aggressive species that selfishly represent the interests of theirhome planets and each is only interested in expanding their own planet’s sphereof influence. Maybe they are looking for gold or uranium. To counteract thesekinds of societies, other aliens form a kind of “galactic club,” a little likean extraterrestrial United Nations, with a charter that prohibits anyextraterrestrial civilization from interfering with the development of anyfledgling civilization until that civilization is capable of joining thegalactic club under its own power. The keeper and the animals stick together.But not forever. You can’t stop your children from growing up, and you can’tstop mankind from striving toward intergalactic travel. The same rules apply toall intelligent life in the universe. However, there is still one hurdle thathas to be overcome before the zoo exhibit “man” may be allowed to break out ofits cage: it must prove its readiness to act peaceably. And that will neverhappen as long as dogmatic religions continue to attack the believers of otherfaiths.Are we peace-loving? Are we ready to put aside our aggression? Are we capable,despite our different faiths, to work together harmoniously? These questionswill be answered sooner or later. The Earth and its entire evolution has neverbeen a closed system. From our very beginnings until far into the future, we arebound up with the evolution of the cosmos. At the moment, we are still in our“zoo” along with our different races and religions, our wildly differingcharacters and types, and the various other plants and animals that inhabit ourplanet. This zoo functions simultaneously as a kind of school. If we get throughour probationary period in the zoo, we will be ready for contact with theuniverse. If we don’t manage it, then we will probably destroy ourselves andquite possibly the whole zoo in the process. It’s a kind of cosmic naturalselection. Mankind must survive its zoo by virtue of its own intellect,dialogues, intelligence, and peaceable nature, before the galactic club willreach out its hand to us.Thus the embargo; the silence of the keepers. It serves both the observation ofmankind as a species, as well as to protect the keepers and the zoo visitorsfrom us. But the embargo against “Earth Zoo” is not total. The ETs are allowedto help us make small jumps, inasmuch as we willingly request this help andprove ourselves worthy of it. But how can helping us in small steps be possible,when an embargo clearly says the opposite? And what does that mean to “proveourselves worthy”? Don’t all religions place great value on proving themselvesworthy to their saviors?Radio astronomer Professor Ronald Bracewell, from Stanford University inCalifornia, believes that every terrestrial government would initially try tosuppress information regarding radio signals from extraterrestrial beings, thereason being that the first government to decode alien signals hopes to use theknowledge they extract to win some sort of advantage over all the others. We arenot just talking about military advantages here; there are also sociological,economical, technological, religious, and cultural aspects. Even if alienmessages were to be intercepted by private researchers or even enthusiastic soloamateurs, governments and universities would be in a position to denounce themessages as “foolish pranks,” “boasts,” or “hoaxes,” and then slap some kind ofsecurity injunction on them. So how can extraterrestrials provide us with help“in small steps” without being stifled at a national level?69[part0008.xhtml#ch02not69] How can we solve this problem?Any indoctrination that is to take place “in small steps” needs to be subtleenough to escape detection by any governments or universities to avoidrepression. The message from outer space must, on the one hand, be madeavailable to the public, but on the other hand be “not acceptable orplau-sible”70 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not70] to the military or science. Accordingto age-old tradition, anything that is “not plausible” is labeled as laughable.And anything that is laughable is beneath the attention of government bodies oruniversities. In our society, religion is considered to be nonscientific; it isa matter of faith. Therefore, messages are encoded in religious texts where theywill not be taken seriously by science. Thus, the embargo remains intact andmankind is brought toward awareness in small steps. “At least no faster thanmankind is ready to accept any extraterrestrial message,” says ProfessorBracewell.71 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not71]THE UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTH?So what’s all this got to do with religious scriptures and the Book of Mormon?Everything! These ancient texts already contain alien information and actions.Now, just imagine that the “Lord” of the Book of Mormon were suddenly to appearin full regalia in his high-tech UFO above a filled football stadium. Or a placeof pilgrimage, over a major city, over an Islamic mosque, a Buddhist temple, orthe venerable cathedral of the Mormons in Salt Lake City. What would thefaithful think? What would the well-established, white-coated scientists stammerwhen they were suddenly confronted with the reality that everything they hadbeen disseminating on the subject of extraterrestrial life and the spanning ofinterstellar distances was pure hogwash? What would the Jews or the Mormons saywhen their God was suddenly revealed to be an alien? What will go through theheads of all those military men who have invested trillions of dollars oftaxpayers’ money in defense missiles, interceptors, and radar systems, when anextraterrestrial suddenly turns up under their very noses? How will all thosethousands of anthropologists and their millions of followers feel when it isrevealed to them—with a snap of the fingers, so to speak—that human developmentis not just the product of evolution, but that there have been targeted,artificial interventions in the human genome? The result would be some kind ofmass cultural and religious shock. We simply would not be psychologicallyprepared. An even worse situation would be if the ETs started filling our skies.That would be seen as some kind of aggression. Man typically fears perceivedaggressors who endanger us or our beloved property or—even worse—threaten tointroduce something foreign into our lives. The God shock would be total!To avoid these kinds of knee-jerk reactions, the action has to be plannedcarefully and over the course of several thousands of years. Religions make itall possible. Mankind is spoon-fed something “divine,” but at a subconsciouslevel, so that it is not noticed until it is absolutely necessary, as soon astechnological evolution has reached the required level, for instance, to thinkin terms of interstellar travel. Those ETs were much more advanced than us,otherwise they would never have managed to cross the light years to reach us inthe first place. They know our psyche, our behavior, for they created man intheir own image. This does not contradict the theory of evolution, as we areonly talking about target mutations here. As they know us as well as they knowthemselves, the path to the stars will be opened slowly, softly, and in a mannerappropriate to the current zeitgeist. That, of course, is changeable. We simplyreceive small nudges occasionally to get our thinking processes going in theright di-rection—but no major pushes.As soon as we are capable of explaining the so-called miracles of the gods intechnical terms, and are at least partially capable of duplicating them forourselves, the gods will be comprehensible to us. Technologies that are just acouple of generations away seem “magical” or “miraculous” to us now. How wouldyour great-grandfather react to seeing a holographic projection in his bedroom?He would think he was having a visitation!Why did the gods of ancient times make it all so complicated? Couldn’t they havejust explained who they were and what they wanted?They did! But the following generations, in their psycho-religious mania toprovide an explanation for what was in the ancient texts, came up with legendarynonsense. What’s more, it simply wasn’t possible to conduct conversations withour forefathers about super-high technology. It was clear to theextraterrestrials that the texts would be adapted over the millennia to matchthe understanding of the age. Yet hidden within the nonsense remained enough ofthe original sense for later generations to be able to extract the requiredinformation. Understand?“A great many people think they are thinking whenthey are merely rearranging their prejudices.”(William James, philosopher, 1842–1910)I am confident that my contemporary analysis of the situation will neitherinsult nor injure the gods of the past. The insight was the whole point of thething. But how do we prove it?THE VISITATION OF MORONIJoseph Smith, the founder of the Mormon religion, described his vision of themessenger Moroni this way:While I was thus in the act of calling upon God, I discovered a light appearingin my room, which continued to increase until the room was lighter than atnoonday, when immediately a personage appeared at my bedside, standing in theair, for his feet did not touch the floor…. After this communication, I saw thelight in the room begin to gather immediately around the person of him who hadbeen speaking to me, and it continued to do so until the room was again leftdark, except just around him….72 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not72]The same appearance with the same words repeats itself three times as if thesame hologram disk was being played back every time. And the voice? Could havebeen telepathically transmitted or phonetically aimed directly at a point onJoseph Smith’s head. The latter is something we can already do today, and theformer is being worked on enthusiastically in many laboratories. But why JosephSmith, and why 1823? He lived in the vicinity of the hill “Cumorah,” in whichthe plates as well as the translator stones Urim and Thummim had lain hidden forthousands of years. (James Smith said “Convenient to the village of Manchester,Ontario County, New York, stands a hill of considerable size, and the mostelevated of any in the neighborhood. On the west side of this hill, not far fromthe top, under a stone of considerable size, lay the plates, deposited in astone box.”73 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not73]) The technology had long been hidden inthis hill. Joseph Smith had probably passed it dozens of times, and his mentalstate—as a result of his search for God—made him receptive to the message. Thefew plates that he found in the stone chest could never have contained theentire Book of Mormon; it is simply too extensive. But think back, dear reader,to the Book of Adam preserved in a sapphire that I mentioned in the firstchapter. Do you remember how Seth carried on dialogs with this book? Thetranslator stones, Urim and Thummim, could have had a similar function. Theycontained the recordings and served as a playback device. They played the textof the Book of Mormon directly into the head of the awestruck and deeplyimpressed young Joseph Smith.I can already hear the protests of the faithful, crying out “Sacrilege!” Gentlydoes it, dear critics from the world of religion. Your scriptures remainfundamentally correct and basically confirm the knowledge of your spiritualcommunity. The content of the Book of Mormon is thoroughly true—with a few laterinsertions. But the modern interpretation does change the perception of the“Lord.” He it was who had the metal plates specially made for the people of thefuture. And what’s more, the “Lord” does not reveal himself as a being ofspirit. Let’s go back to the Book of Mormon:(Ether 3:6) And the veil was taken from off the eyes of the brother of Jared,and he saw the finger of the Lord; and it was as the finger of a man, like untoflesh and blood…. (3:8) And he saith unto the Lord: I saw the finger of theLord, and I feared lest he should smite me; for I knew not that the Lord hadflesh and blood. (3:9) And the Lord said unto him: Because of thy faith thouhast seen that I shall take upon me flesh and blood; and never has man comebefore me with such exceeding faith as thou hast; for were it not so ye couldnot have seen my finger. Sawest thou more than this?…. (3:15) Seest thou that yeare created after mine own image? Yea, even as all men were created in thebeginning after mine own image.74 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not74]Astonishing. The “Lord” possesses a human form and asks the man if he has seenmore than a finger. An omniscient god should have known the answer to that onealready. He presents himself in a corporeal form, but could, he assures us, alsotake on a spiritual one (even Moses in the Bible never actually saw his God, butwas permitted to look in his direction). Okay. So why, for heaven’s sake, can’tthis “Lord” be the Great Spirit of Creation?1. He uses technology: shipbuilding, luminous stones, talking balls, a compass,metal plates.2. The “Lord” takes a trip to America to “correct” his own religion because ithas developed in the wrong direction (the mighty old church of Christianity isdescribed a “great whore” in the Book of Mormon).The Great Spirit of Creation, timeless and omnipresent as he is, would hardlyhave need of corrections, and he certainly wouldn’t renege on his contracts. (Inthe Old Testament, he made two eternal contracts with Noah and with Abraham.)MAĢNIFICENT TEMPLESOn their way from South America into the North, the ancestors of today’s Mormonsbuilt many temples. This is written in the Book of Mormon. Even temples “afterthe manner of the temple of Solomon.” One of these incomprehensible systems layshigh in the Andes in Peru: the temple of Chavín de Huántar. No archeologist hasa clue who built this impressive temple complex at an elevation of around 3,180meters above sea level, so they speak respectfully of a “Chavín culture.” Eventhe dating of the building work is uncertain. Experts argue that Chavín deHuántar, was a place of pilgrimage, the religious center of an unknown peoplethat suddenly appeared in the high valley of the Mosna River and dominated theculture in the area for several centuries. A center of pilgrimage? Which god didthe Indios make pilgrimages to? In Chavín de Huántar there are many inexplicablecolumns and fantastic reliefs featuring flying deities. Below the temple, on themain square, a colleague of the archeologist Julio C. Tello found an obelisk,which now resides in the Archeological Museum of Lima. As no one has everfigured it out, I’ll show you the engravings on page 165[part0005.xhtml#page_165].May the light of decryption shine on you! Just as inexplicable is the RaimondiStela, also found in Chavín de Huántar and also to be found in the ArcheologicalMuseum of Lima.image [../Images/image00171.jpeg]One of the mysterious columns from Chavín de Huántar.image [../Images/image00172.jpeg]Yet another intricately carved stone block from Chavín de Huántar.image [../Images/image00173.jpeg]A close-up of the Raimondi Stela showing the intricate and precise detail of thecarving.image [../Images/image00174.jpeg]Engineer Wolfgang Volkrodt believed that the Raimondi Stela depicted an ancientsteam engine.The block is made of diorite, a type of igneous rock, is 1.75 meters tall, andis 17 centimeters thick. Archeologists speculate about a “jaguar god,” “snake orcat gods,” “scepters, monsters, masks,” and even “the consummate image of theincarnation of the godhead, the god of creation Viracocha.”75[part0008.xhtml#ch02not75] Wolfgang Volkrodt, a top engineer, is the only personwho has taken a different approach. He took an extensive look at the RaimondiStela and was able to clearly demonstrate that the engravings were actually “ahighly precise, symmetrical, technical drawing.”76 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not76] Itperfectly shows the structure of a steam engine with “ratchet blades, rotarypistons, levers, leaf springs, and ball joints.”77 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not77]The machine could be used to tighten ropes and pull loads.Engineers look at things with different eyes archeologists. They have adifferent reservoir of specialist knowledge. And even though Volkrodt’s analysisis faultless and can be attested down to the smallest detail, that doesn’tbother the archeologists in the slightest. Their blinkers allow no otherinterpretation apart from their own. Books by authors such as Volkrodt orBlumrich, a NASA chief engineer who carried out a flawless and word-for-wordanalysis of the spaceship described by the prophet Ezekiel in the OldTestament,78 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not78] are not considered part of the scholarlyliterature to be used in their craft. Yet works such as those by Volkrodt andBlumrich pleasantly add another dimension to this cramped and inhibited worldview. They open windows and let in fresh thoughts. But keep your eyes firmlybolted shut! What you don’t know can’t hurt you!Annoyingly, the winged beings and the engravings on the Raimondi Stela are sofinely wrought and precisely carved into the extremely hard diorite thatstandard tools, such as a sharp chisel, could not possibly have been used. Evena lay observer can see that straight away. That’s why I’m showing you thepictures. To achieve this level of precision, extremely hard rotary drills musthave been used. Who had that sort of technical expertise back then? My money ison a group of people led by a highly adept “Lord” who provided his people withtechnology when they needed it, not only to carve dior-ite with this degree ofprecision, but also to accurately engrave metal plates. And I recommend to theindustrious Mormons, who are always looking for copies of the metal library oftheir forefather, that they try taking measurements under the temple of Chavínde Huántar.A QUESTION OF FAITHI have great respect for the Book of Mormon and the knowledge contained withinit, and I also admire the Mormon faith in the histories of Ether and Nephi—butthere is one point where I take exception. Again and again in the Book of Mormonyou can find insertions from (allegedly) Jesus, the (alleged) founder ofChristianity. The Church of Jesus, so says the “Lord” in the Book of Mormon, isnot developing as had been foreseen; it is evolving in a completely falsedirection, therefore he, the son of God, has to come to America to found a newtrue church, the Church of Jesus of Latter-day Saints. I can understand theseinsertions. Joseph Smith and his brave companions were under a great deal ofpressure in the United States. The only religion that was allowed toexist—albeit in countless different variations—was Christianity, and the utterlynonconformist messages of Ether and Nephi simply didn’t fit the picture. Smithand his followers would have been hunted down, denigrated, humiliated, andharassed. Many young Mormons actually did end up in prison—including JosephSmith himself. Some form of correction was vital, and namely one that broughtthe son of God, Jesus, into play. So, in came the insertions. Their reasoningwas fully understandable, but false (just as false as the later Jesus insertionsin the Book of Enoch, which were made by a later hand and exist nowhere in theoriginal text).The whole Jesus story, starting with original sin, the immaculate conception,the redemption, the resurrection, and going right on through to theascension—all pillars of the Christian faith—is mixed up from the verybeginning. This is not know-it-all Erich von Däniken speaking; this comes fromrenowned theology professors, such as the Catholic scholars Professor H. Küngand Professor J. Drewermann,79 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not79], 80[part0008.xhtml#ch02not80] or the researcher and church critic KarlheinzDeschner.81 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not81] If, however, the Christian church isbased on an erroneous foundation—if there was no original sin and subsequentlyno need for redemption—then logically speaking no son of God could have come toAmerica to improve and correct his own religion. Errare humanum est, as theancient Romans used to say. To err is human—not divine.Why a metal library in Ecuador? After the “Lord” patently failed to manifest inany form as the Great Spirit of Creation for thousands of years, and because heused technology instead of miracles, he assumes the burden of proof. In thefuture! He wants to prove to mankind, in no uncertain terms, that he was the onewho was pulling the strings back then. This could work in a critical societythat doubts everything, that fakes pictures using computers, that no longerbelieves in wonders, and that has renounced the supernatural and has bought intoscientific reason, but never with new pseudo-miracles (especially miracles thatare likely to be exposed after 20 years or so when technology has caught up).Mankind demands solid, scientific, flawless material proof. It must be tangible,photographable, datable, and definitively significant. It must be, as the Bookof Mormon puts it, “of great value.” Not for the people all those thousands ofyears ago—we are the people being addressed. This conclusion is clearly logicalsince the “Lord” had the plates engraved all those millennia ago just so theycould be read in the future. These proofs of the “Lord” are supposed to turn up“when it shall be said that miracles are done away; and it shall come even as ifone should speak from the dead” (Mormon 8:16).82 [part0008.xhtml#ch02not82]With the metal library in Ecuador, we are standing directly before this greatrealization.At the most, we can speculate about the motivation for this “divine” behavior.But the messages themselves are completely unmistakable. The “Lord” of antiquityis not identical with the Great Spirit of Creation. He, of course, would notmake any mistakes in the first place, so would have no need of latercorrections. So this “Lord” has metal plates specially made for the people ofthe future, because he wants to prove that it was he who was pulling thestrings. The Great Spirit of Creation doesn’t need to prove anything.It seems to me that these so-called gods of the past were—even then—alreadyplanning their return, and they wanted to ensure that we will respect them forwhat they did for us back then. They created us “in their image.”(Mormon 8:14 ff) And blessed be he that shall bring this thing to light; for itshall be brought out of darkness unto light…and whoso shall bring it [thehistorical account] to light, him will the Lord bless.83[part0008.xhtml#ch02not83]"},{"pageContent":"NATURAL SCIENCE IN NAZCABACK TO PERU“The secret of Nazca has finally been revealed!” announced the headline in oneof Germany’s most highly respected newspapers, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung,on July 14, 2007.1 [part0008.xhtml#ch03not1] The subtitle added: “Geoglyphs inthe desert—not for aliens, but for religious processions.” Needless to say, Igot my share: “It has primarily been the UFO theories of archeo-fantasist Erichvon Däniken that have kept the kilometer-long lines and animal figures, featuresthat were scraped into the desert floor thousands of years ago, in the publiceye.”2 [part0008.xhtml#ch03not2]Well, at least they gave me that much. The article reveals that the Peruvianarcheologist Johny Isla believed he had finally found the solution to theenigmatic trenches. They are, he claimed, ancient procession routes. This hadbeen unequivocally confirmed by a team of Swiss, German, and Peruvianarcheologists. Together with Markus Reindel of the German ArcheologicalInstitute, Johny Isla had put together an interdisciplinary team of experts toinvestigate the phenomenon. Markus Reindel presented the results later at theBonn Center for Science in Germany.Fabulous. Yet another case of the “most plausible solution” making all furtherinvestigation unnecessary. The world is safe again. Hallelujah! But as Germanlyrical poet Wilhelm Busch once wrote, “But here, as usual, it’ll turn outdifferently from what we expect.” Let’s take a look at the facts:There was once a sleepy little town, somewhere behind the seven mountains, inthe South of Peru. It was linked to the capital, Lima, by a long dusty road thatno one took unless they absolutely had to. This road stretched out for hundredsof kilometers through a desolate desert of sand and gravel and on down towardsChile. Every 90 minutes or so, you would pass a poverty-stricken village: alwaysat a point where an arroyo or stream flowed down from the distant Andes tryingto find its way to the Pacific Ocean.These days, around half of this stretch of road between Lima and Nazca—around500 kilometers apart—is a paved four-lane highway that winds its way through thedesert between the desiccated hills. The once-sleepy town of Nazca has become alively little place with a museum, a small park, shops, and two banks. Hotels ofvarious differing standards vie to attract tourists, and out on the outskirts ofthe town there is a desert airstrip with a tower and a bar. From here, visitorscan—for around $150—take a flight over the world-famous “Pampa de Nazca.” Manyof them find it hard to keep down their lunch when the pilot banks from onetight curve into the next.Down below the airplane, the greatest picture book in the world stretches outacross the landscape. Suddenly, a colossal spider appears down on the surface ofthe rust-brown sand and gravel desert. Then a hummingbird, a monkey, severalspirals, a fish, and—between them all—perfectly straight lines, stretching outfor miles! There are also various other figures on the mountainsides, includinga man who looks more than a little like an astronaut. And then there are “laspistas.” They look like rundown, disused landing strips whose contours are justvisible through the sand. The longest one stretches out for almost threekilometers.What on Earth is all this? What is Nazca? Well, for one thing, Nazca isenigmatic, mysterious, and more than a little spooky. The desert in Nazca seemsnormal enough, yet, at the same time a little eerie. It is magical, beguiling,logical, and yet absurd. Nazca is like a hundred lightning strikes againstcommon sense. If eyes could scream, they’d do it in Nazca. The message of Nazcais veiled and hidden from sight, resisting any attempt at explanation. Anyonewho thinks that there could a simple solution for this mystery, probably stillbelieves in the Easter Bunny, too. The landscape is fathomless and irresolvable,preposterous, and senseless. In Nazca, the cords of logic go up in smoke,because they no longer want to be drawn around in circles. Nazca escapes allingenuity, although year upon year, archeo-criminologists appear there in hordesclaiming to have finally solved the mystery. Science—in Nazca it’sarcheology—compulsively attempts to impose our contemporary knowledge andthinking upon ancient civilizations that had a completely different view of theworld.Brimming with our own self-importance, we claim to be clever, wise, and blessedwith an acuity of mind that we do not, in reality, possess. We believe thatscientific methodology will lead us inevitably to the nirvana of insight. Thus,over the last few decades, countless Nazca theories, Nazca speculations, Nazcaflights of fancy, and plain Nazca nonsense have come about. And in the end, noneof them can really provide a definitive answer. Nazca is like a time machinethat takes us back into our past, and anyone who wants to get a little closer tosolving the Nazca mystery needs to think out of the box. Admittedly, thearcheological approach does throw up a few interesting possibilities, but onlyhalf-truths.AN AMAZINĢ DISCOVERYIn the spring of 1927, Peruvian archeologist Toribio Mejía Xesspe was working ina small tributary valley of the Rio de Nazca. He clambered up the side of thevalley and, while taking a bit of a break, looked down onto the pampa. He sawsomething that looked quite strange: there, in the brown-black desert below, hecould see unswerving lines stretching out into the distance in front of him. Yetit wasn’t until 13 years later, after he had paced off two of the strange lines,that he finally wrote about his findings.3 [part0008.xhtml#ch03not3]In June 1940, New York-based historian Paul Kosok took off in a sport plane overNazca. He sighted several pistas, “líneas” (the smaller, narrower lines), andspirals. His article on the subject wasn’t published until 1947.4[part0008.xhtml#ch03not4]By then, German geographer and mathematician Dr. Maria Reiche had made her wayfrom Dresden to Peru. Dr. Reiche knew nothing about the lines in Nazca; she wasmore interested in researching the calendrical connections between the varioussolar observation sites that can be found in Peru. By a lucky coincidence, shemet up with Paul Kosok, who enthusiastically told her about the strange markingshe had discovered from the air. Maria Reiche began to look into the subject. Atfirst it was only a side project, but soon she fell prey to the fascination ofthese strange markings. Together with Paul Kosok, she published a long articleabout the plateau in the journal Archaeology.5 [part0008.xhtml#ch03not5]In the following years, Maria Reiche got really stuck in Nazca. Her researchinto the desert plateau became her life, and she spent many years trying tocrack the Nazca nut. Back then, even Maria Reiche compared some of the pistas toairstrips: “Then the air passenger…will discover large triangles and squareswith lines so accurately flanking the paler background surfaces they look as ifthey were drawn with a ruler…you might think some of them were landing strips.”6[part0008.xhtml#ch03not6]When I wrote something along the same lines in 1967—at a time when Dr. Reiche’sself-published book was not yet available—I was torn to pieces by the critics.7[part0008.xhtml#ch03not7] Since then, all sorts of quotes on the subject havebeen attributed to me—in every imaginable medium—that I never even said.Ironically, it was some of the allegedly “serious” publications that spread someof most ridiculous rubbish that you can imagine. It is a perfect example of howa statement can be falsely quoted and then make its way into the press archivefrom which it is continuously dug out anew to be misquoted again.In addition to that, many people assert—regrettably even scientificpublications—in a tone of honest indignation, that I had claimed that the Nazcaplateau was some kind of “landing site for space vessels.”8[part0008.xhtml#ch03not8] None of these word butchers has ever read my books, 9[part0008.xhtml#ch03not9],10 [part0008.xhtml#ch03not10] especially my Nazca bookZeichen für die Ewigkeit.11 [part0008.xhtml#ch03not11] If they had done so andhad still come out with the usual untruths, I would have had to accuse theauthors of lying. As it is, one author simply copies the mistakes of another andadds his or her own two cents worth in the process. That is why, I’m sorry tosay, I can’t take any of these so-called scientific authors writing about Nazcaseriously anymore.Dr. Maria Reiche didn’t find the answer to the Nazca puzzle. Just before shedied in 1998, the venerable old researcher bitterly opined that maybe Nazca hadsomething to do shamans or spirits.There are more theories about Nazca than there are fish in the sea, it seems. Ilisted as many as I could in my Nazca book, so I’ll skip the bibliography hereand go straight to a list of some of the more popular theories.Nazca is:image [../Images/image00170.jpeg] An astronomical calendar.image [../Images/image00170.jpeg] Tribal signs of the Indios.image [../Images/image00170.jpeg] A water god cult.image [../Images/image00170.jpeg] A mountain god cult.image [../Images/image00170.jpeg] An agricultural cult.image [../Images/image00170.jpeg] Agricultural land allotments.image [../Images/image00170.jpeg] Border markings.image [../Images/image00170.jpeg] Pens for animals.image [../Images/image00170.jpeg] Paths for sacred activities.image [../Images/image00170.jpeg] Procession routes.image [../Images/image00170.jpeg] Geometrical information.image [../Images/image00170.jpeg] A site for ceremonial activities.image [../Images/image00170.jpeg] Copies of visions.image [../Images/image00170.jpeg] A colossal weaving factory.image [../Images/image00170.jpeg] A map.image [../Images/image00170.jpeg] A cultural atlas.image [../Images/image00170.jpeg] A pre-Inca Olympic games.image [../Images/image00170.jpeg] A prehistoric balloon launching pad.image [../Images/image00170.jpeg] An orgy of all kinds of cults.THE TROUBLE WITH ARCHEOLOĢISTSAs you can see, the archeologists have been busy in Nazca. Every couple of yearsor so, the scientific literature trumpets its latest definitive solution. So wehave to ask ourselves: what are they actually doing up there, thesearcheologists and their sweating students?Well, they do what archeologists always do: they dig. It’s scientificallyflawless work and the participating teams, mostly just a handful of people,consist of upright and honest men and women. They look at the layers of stone,bones, remnants of buildings, textiles, pottery, and wood. They gallantlycollect, sort, compare, and date every single piece. Finally, they make theirconclusions. These come usually from the expedition leaders, who have generallywalked the straight path from classical archeological thinking right into thechaotic confusion of Nazca.Archeologists live from debris. Their view is the world of evolution, always onething neatly after the other. On the basis of a few tiny fragments, they maketheir conclusions and apply them to the entire broad plateaus of Nazca andPalpa. Any further questions are unnecessary and unwanted; doubts are ridiculed.Students have no chance against the monolithic immutability of professorialwisdom. Half-knowledge is promoted to the definitive established wisdom that thenext generation of students has to swallow. And, before you know it, all of theopinions follow the same pattern, from scientist to journalist.What can we do to break this pattern? Luckily, there are scientists withmeasuring apparatus who believe in their readings and not in ideologies. I knewthat Professor Gunter Reppchen from the HTW Dresden (a university of technologyand economics) had already taken measurements in Nazca in the middle of theNineties. Professor Reppchen is head of the surveying and cartographydepartment, and his department had been drawn toward Nazca because Dr. MariaReiche was also a native of Dresden. The scientists from the university aimed tosurvey all of the geoglyphs and lines in the entire Nazca area to create adigital model.Professor Reppchen and I met for the first time at his college in Dresden whileit was in the process of organizing an exhibition on Nazca. This sober academic,who has also carried out research in the Antarctic, doesn’t think much of theidea of aliens, but does attach a great deal of importance to hard (that is,measurable and verifiable) data. At later meetings, I asked him if hisdepartment might be interested in carrying out a research project in Nazca thatwas light years away from standard archeology. In the end, I dug out a number ofexcellent photographs from my Nazca archive—I have more than 5,000—and began tomark certain areas with a red marker pen. Then I asked questions that noarcheologist would have asked (because he would consider them to besuperfluous)—questions such as these:1. Do the narrow zigzag lines, which can be seen in the photograph, really rununder the pista, or is it an optical illusion?2. Do the narrow, roughly 1-meter-wide lines consist of the same material as thepistas, or is it just scraped-off surface material?3. Is it possible to ascertain whether there is any difference between themagnetic fields of the pistas, líneas, and surrounding gravel, particularly atthe crossing points and in comparison with the untouched desert?4. Are there any anomalies in the conductivity of the ground in comparison withthe pistas and the surrounding area?5. Is there any detectable radiation?6. Can any material be detected that would not normally be expected in suchquantities, such as minerals, ores, gold, or mica?7. Are there differences in the ages of the various pistas, especially atcrossing points?And so on. All of my questions referred to things that could be preciselymeasured by science. Professor Reppchen quickly realized that this would involvean interdisciplinary research team and that a Peruvian university would have tobe involved. The Nazca plateau is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which means thatno one is allowed to just wander onto it, not to mention start poking around andtaking measurements. Over the next few months, a network of scientists startedtaking shape, comprised of experts from a number of different universities,every single one of them a specialist in his or her own field. At the head ofthe pack was the brilliant Dr. Kerstin Hartsch, an extremely gifted geologistwho enjoys tackling unconventional problems.The research project was commissioned by the Erich von Däniken Foundation, whichtook over all the financing. The HTW Dresden teamed up with the PontificiaUniversidad Católica del Perú (PUCP). The most decisive issue involved gettingpermits to even visit Nazca. These permits were issued—partially, thanks to thehelp of the German Embassy—by the Instituto Nacional de Cultura (INC). Duringthe entire fieldwork, a representative of the INC, as well as an archeologistfrom the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos in Lima, accompanied ourparty. The two tireless scientists, Reppchen and Hartsch, traveled to Peru manytimes to help put the various pieces of the puzzle together. It involvedtracking down expensive, high-tech measuring instruments, customs permits,negotiations with various institutes and academics, and even banal matters suchas finding accommodations for students.The strange thing is this: nobody had ever thought to carry out magneticmeasurements in Nazca before, not to mention geochemical studies orgeoelectrical surveying. To start with, the team investigated the surface of thedesert. They needed to find out which elements and minerals were normal for thearea. In what is known as “hamadas” (areas covered in fine grain sand that hasbeen blown in or away) they discovered manganese, potassium, copper, gold,and—often near to the excavated drawings—clay: the raw materials for ceramics.But nothing out of the ordinary.SLICED-OFF MOUNTAINIn the desert area of Nazca, you can also see a strange-looking mountain, whichI called the “sliced-off mountain.” Geologists see it differently, of course. Isay “sliced-off” because it has no peak, just a flat top, which doesn’t fit inwith any of the other mountains that surround it. These all end in a point, asyou would expect mountains to do. In addition to this, the surface of the“sliced-off mountain” features a zigzag line that can easily be recognized fromthe air. This mountain with the zigzag line under its pista interested me inparticular. It didn’t fit in with the general orgy of cults. At the southern endof the pista, on this very mountain, archeologists had discovered smallconstructions with stone walls. These were categorized—as seems to be usual—assome kind of ceremonial sites. Of all the sites in Nazca, this was one of themost important, but unfortunately the interdisciplinary team had not been ableto acquire a permit to work there. German archeologist Markus Reindel from Bonn,the very same man who in the summer of 2007 had triumphantly announced that theNazca lines were processional routes, had prohibited any measurements. You haveto ask yourself: what was his motive for doing so? A team of German scientistscame to Peru. They were working together with the Universidad Católica in Limaand a representative of the Instituto Nacional de Cultura, and were justcarrying out measurements on the plateau. And they had permits. And althoughthese measurements were completely harmless to the site and would not causedamage to the ground or any architectural remnants, a German archeologistprohibited the work. Was he afraid of what might be measured there?Luckily, my questions didn’t apply exclusively to the “sliced-off mountain,” andthe international research team simply chose a different start site. Were thereirregularities in the area, particularly in and around the pistas? The amount ofgeoelectricity you would expect to find is dependent on the ground’s ability toconduct electricity. In a steamy bathroom, it’s pretty easy to get a lethalelectric shock. But in a dry desert, you would expect the conductivity to bepretty low. To measure the geoelectricity sensors are pushed into the ground,where they give out light pulses of alternating current. The electrodes aremoved along the ground profile, step by step, to measure changes in theelectrical resistance. Depending on the distance between the electrodes, theelectrical resistance can be measured up to a depth of several meters. And thisis where we found our first irregularities.Normally, it’s practically impossible to carry out measurements like these inthe desert because of the extreme aridity of the ground and the associateddifficulty of feeding electricity into the ground at all. But thanks to thenewly developed equipment that the team had, and against all expectations, weachieved good and highly detailed results. They discovered that thegeoelectrical resistance of the normal ground was relatively low when comparedto the geoglyphs. Suddenly—this happened at the end of one of the pistas as wellas one of the líneas—the measurements shot off the scale, exceeding the normalvalues by a factor of more than a thousand. You can see it in the dark areas ofthe tables. There were strips in a patch of ground designated as “Area N4,”where an extremely high electrical resistance could be measured running up toand along the edge of the pista. In the “Pampa del Calendario” the center ofelectrical resistance lay two meters below the surface. Strong electricalanomalies were also measured at other locations. The reason for these isunknown.But wait—the story gets better. I had asked about the magnetic fields at certainlocations. The basis for geomagnetic measurements is the Earth’s own magneticfield. To carry out measurements you need a cesium magnetometer. The resultsfrom Nazca showed significant differences between the various líneas and theuntouched ground surrounding them. Back on the “Pampa del Calendario,” the teamdiscovered a veritable network of magnetic anomalies within one of the pistas.The white spots on the picture represent these wild concentrations of magneticimpossibilities. These were so crazy that the measurement apparatus were nolonger able to display the values—they were right off the scale! Confusing.image [../Images/image00175.jpeg]Strong electrical anomalies were detected in Area N4. Image courtesy of theErich von Däniken Foundation, Switzerland.Within the survey site “Area P2” (Sacramento), new electrical anomalies croppedup on and below the zigzag lines. Although archeologist Dr. Reindel hadforbidden any measurements to be taken on the “sliced-off mountain,” theinterdisciplinary team did at least manage to obtain readings from two spots.Near the zigzag line, right at the end of the South-West side, electricalanomalies were discovered that exactly matched the zigzag line itself. Really?Nothing special in Nazca? Just a bunch of processional routes?The pista that resembles the landing strip on the top of the “sliced-offmountain” doesn’t cover the entire plateau. On both sides of the pista aremargins that are intersected at numerous locations by the zigzag lines. Thecorners of these zigzags lay where the ground has broken away. There are alsofurrows of rubble, which have been caused by the rare but heavy rains.Logically, the rain must have run directly over the zigzag lines to create theriver along the edge of the plateau which drew the rubble with it. The picturesshow it clearly. Why—for holy Atahualpa’s sake!—weren’t the zigzags washed awayas well?The erosion channels that run from the edges of plateau into the depths are morethan a meter wide. It must have rained cats and dogs and elephants! On this“sliced-off mountain,” with its pista and zigzag lines, where the watercollected before tumbling down into the valley below, there should have beennothing to see but erosion debris. The pictures show the opposite. What’s more,the team was able to measure crystal clear magnetic anomalies here too. At theend (or is it the beginning?) of the pista a small rectangular building wasdiscovered around 2 meters wide and a little more than 3 meters long. At thetime of the archeological discovery, the remaining walls were about 92centimeters tall. According to cult thinking, this can only have been a holyplace: a place where the pilgrims came or where the priests carried outceremonies. Why doesn’t anybody ask the question: what kind of ceremonies? Andthe additional question: why here at the start (or end?) of the pista, of allplaces? What was so interesting here that they needed or wanted to observe?NOT QUITE WHAT THEY SEEMWhile I’m at it, I’d like to clear up another piece of nonsense that you canread in all the scientific literature—namely, that it would have been quitesimple to construct the líneas and pistas. The fact is, they claim, the sun hasbeen beating down on this desert for hundreds of thousands of years andtherefore the surface is a darker brown than the underlying layer. All you haveto do is scrape away a few stones or a bit of sand and—presto!—the lighter layerappears.12 [part0008.xhtml#ch03not12],13 [part0008.xhtml#ch03not13] There areindeed certain places where that works; I’ve tried it myself. But at otherlocations, it’s simply inconceivable. If the “sliced-off mountain” had comeabout by a simple process of scraping away the surface layer, then the zigzagline, which runs under the pista, must have been scraped away as well. Theboundary ridges that run along each side of the pista would have to have thesame color. But they don’t. Still think they’re procession routes?Both in and around Nazca things are not quite as natural as they should be, oras the smooth-talking scientists would have us believe. If you recall, I alsoposed the question as to the age of the pistas in the “Pampa San Ignacio” (AreaP5). This is a site where two pistas run into each other and overlap at one end.The research team was able to confirm that the pista that appears on the left ofthe photograph on page 188 [part0006.xhtml#page_188] is much older than the oneon the right.This result only tells us that one of them is older than the other, not how oldthey actually are. Yet the entire Nazca cult—or perhaps we should say cargo cult(= imitation cult)—must be much older than the archeologists claim anyway. Why?Because many of the pistas and líneas on the surface are practically no longerdiscernible, but lie underneath the surface of the grit.Nothing unusual in Nazca? What about the chemical elements? As expected, theresearch team found all the usual components. But when it came to arsenic, thedials went off the scale. The arsenic concentration at some measurement siteswas between 10 and 17 times as high as it should have been.image [../Images/image00176.jpeg]Area P5. The pista on the left is far older than the one on the right. Imagecourtesy of the Erich von Däniken Foundation, Switzerland.The stuff is extremely poisonous! Why would anyone want to use arsenic? Today,it is mixed with lead alloys to improve their consistency. It is also used insemiconductor technology and electronics where, in the form of gallium arsenide,it plays an important role in the manufacture of high-frequency components suchas integrated circuits and computer wafers. Arsenic also features in light andlaser diodes.The concentration of arsenic at the measurement points was clearly far too high.It didn’t fit in with the general averages of the other elements in theNazca/Palpa area.Geologist Dr. Kerstin Hartsch also noticed something else interesting. Directlyon the Panamericana—the highway that runs from Lima down into Chile, rightacross the Nazca plateau—between the brown masses of rubble, a number oflight-colored layers could be seen. They were particularly apparent on theSacramento heights and behind the small school in Ilipata. What were they?During my first visit to Nazca, I scratched away at the white substance, whichreminded me of salt, using a pocket knife and took it back to my hotel where Itried to dissolve it in hot and cold water. No dice. The scientists carried outan analysis revealing that it consisted of 70 percent of some amorphousmaterial, without any traces of clay. A further analysis using a scanningelectron microscope revealed glass-like structures of a kind that only normallyoccurs when the raw material is rapidly cooled from an extremely hightemperature. How is that possible? There are no mysteries in Nazca?The German-Peruvian research team finally put together their findings in ascientific report, which made the following conclusions:1. The results of the magnetic measurements showed a clear difference betweenthe líneas and pistas and the untouched surrounding area.2. The geoelectrical measurements revealed clear anomalies at up to 2 metersbelow the geoglyphs.3. The geological environment of Nazca/Palpa is characterized by unusually high,localized deposits of arsenic.4. A white material was discovered next to certain screes that consisted mainlyof glass. The origin of this material could not be explained.How simple and uncomplicated the world is from an archeological point of view!Nothing mysterious? Nothing unexplained? Thousands of years ago, the inhabitantsof the area built huge procession routes to honor their gods. Okay! I’ve gotnothing against that theory. Procession routes did exist! But—and it’s a big“but”—the best of the pistas in Nazca and Palpa start and finish in the middleof nowhere. Where are the trails that would have to have led up to theseprocession routes? Did the faithful fly up there? Hardly. How did the processionroute manage to run, straight as an arrow, up the mountainside? And what kind ofgods were they worshipping? For what kind of gods do you scratch symbols in theground that are—with only a few exceptions!—only visible from the air? Do youget the picture now?image [../Images/image00177.jpeg]The pistas are only visible from the air. So who was supposed to see them?Those who are not acquainted with ancient Indian literature, in which variouskinds of flying vehicles—known as Vimanas—are described; those who know nothingof King Solomon’s flying chariot; those who haven’t got a clue about the shuttlecraft explicitly described by Ezekiel; those who have never heard of the Tibetan“pearls in the sky” or the Egyptian “barges of the gods,” should wait beforethey make any final judgment about Nazca.14 [part0008.xhtml#ch03not14] Nobodyshould be making final judgments about such a wonderful and mysterious place asNazca; sooner or later they are all revealed to be preposterous. Finally, justto hammer it in a bit more for those who still haven’t cottoned on: I neverwrote in any of my books that aliens built the “landing strips” in Nazca, orthat the site is some kind of “spaceport”!“Those who cannot attack the thought, insteadattack the thinker.”(Paul Valéry, 1871–1945)"},{"pageContent":"AFTERWORDDear Readers,Just to round off, I’d like to tell you about the Archaeology, Astronautics &SETI Research Association (or AAS, for short). We are looking for new answers,because the old ones just don’t cut the mustard.Our aim is to find recognized evidence of the existence of a visitation to earthby extraterrestrial beings at some time during man’s early history. We want todo this within the framework of established scientific methods, but withoutletting ourselves be intimidated or limited by existing dogmas or paradigms.Every two months, we publish the magazine LEGENDARY TIMES, which is sent out toall AAS members. We also organize national and international conferences andmeetings, as well as study trips to interesting archeological sites.Our yearly subscription is around $40 (as of this writing in 2009). Ourmembership includes renowned scientists, as well as laypersons from all kinds ofprofessions.I would be happy to provide you with further information.
