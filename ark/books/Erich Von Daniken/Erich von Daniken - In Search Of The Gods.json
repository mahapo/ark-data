Because its theories and proofs do not fit into the mosaic of traditional archaeology, constructed so labori­ ously and firmly cemented down, scholars will call it non­ sense and put it on the Index of those books which are better left unmentioned. Laymen will withdraw into the snail shell of their familiar world when faced with the probability that finding out about our past will be even more mysterious and adventurous than finding out about the future. Nevertheless, one thing is certai n. There is something in­ consistent about our past, that past which lies thousands and millions of years behind us. The past teemed with unknown gods who visited the primeval earth in manned spaceships. Incredible technical achievements existed in the past. There is a mass of know-how which we have only partially redi s ­ covered today. There is something inconsistent about our archaeologyf Because we fin4 electric batteries many thousands of years old.

There is something inconsistent about our religion. A fea­ ture common to every religion is that it promises help and salvation to mankind. The primitive gods gave such promises, too. Why didn't they keep them? Why did they use ultra­ modern weapons on primitive peoples? And why did they plan to destroy them? Let us get used to the idea that the world of ideas which has grown up over the millennia is going to collapse. A few years of accurate research has already brought down the men­ tal edifice in which we had made ourselves at home. Knowl­ edge that was hidden in the libraries of secret societies is being rediscovered. The age of space travel is no longer an age of secrets. We have now landed on the moon. Space travel, which aspires to suns and stars, also plumbs the abysses of our past for us. Gods and priests, kings and heroes, emerge from the dark chasms. We must challenge them to deliver up their secrets, for we have the means to find out all about our past, without leaving any gaps, if we really want to. Modern laboratories must take over the work of archaeo­ logical research. Archaeologists must visit the devastated sites of the past with ultrasensitive measuring apparatus. Priests who seek the truth must again begin to doubt everything that is established. The gods of the dim past have left countless traces which we can read and decipher today for the first time because the problem of space travel, so topical today, was not a problem, but a reality, to the men of thousands of years ago. I claim that our forefathers received visits from the universe in the remote past, even though I do not yet know who these extra­ terrestrial intelligences were or from which planet they came. I nevertheless proclaim that these \"strangers\" annihilated part of mankind existing at the time and produced a new, perhaps the first, homo sapiens. 10"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"This assertion is revolutionary.

I s it conceivable that we world citizens of the twentieth cen­ tury are not the only living beings of our kind in the cos­ mos? Because no homunculus from another planet is on dis­ play in a museum for us to visit, the answer, \"Our earth is the only planet with human beings,\" still seems to be legit­ imate and convincing. But the forest of question marks grows and grows as soon as we make a careful study of the facts resulting from the latest discoveries and research work. On a clear night the naked eye can see about 4 ,500 stars, so the astronomers say. The telescope of even a small ob­ servatory makes nearly 2,000,000 stars visible, and a modem reflecting telescope brings the light from thousands of mil­ lions more to the viewer-specks of light in the Milky Way. But in the colossal dimensions of the cosmos our stellar sys­ tem is only a tiny part of an incomparably larger stellar sys­ tem--of a cluster of Milky Ways, one might say, containing some twenty galaxies within a radius of 1,50 0,000 light-years (I light-year = the distance traveled by light in a year, i.e., 186,OOOX60X60X2 4 X 3 65 miles). And even this vast number of stars is small in comparison with the many thousands of 15"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"spiral nebulae disclosed by the electronic telescope. Disclosed to the present day, I should emphasize, for research of this kind is only just beginning. Astronomer Harlow Shapley estimates that there are some 1020 stars within the range of our telescopes. When Shapley associates a planetary system with only one in a thou­ sand stars, we may assume that it is a very cautious estimate. If we continue to speculate on the basis of this estimate and suspect the necessary conditions for life on only one star in a thousand, this calculation still gives a figure of 1014• Shapley asks: How many stars in this truly \"astronomical\" figure have an atmosphere suitable for life? One in a thousand? That would still leave the incredible figure of 1011 stars with the prerequisites for life. Even if we assume that only every thousandth planet out of this figure has produced life, there are still 100,000,000 planets on which we can speculate that life exists. This calculation is based on telescopes using the techniques available today, but we ,nust not forget that these are constantly being improved. If we follow the hypothesis of biochemist Dr. Stanley Miller, life and the conditions essential for life may have developed more quickly on some of these planets than on earth. If we accept this daring assumption, civilizations more advanced than our own could have developed on 100,000 planets. The late Willy Ley, well-known scientific writer, and friend of Wernher von Braun, told me in New York: \"The estimated number of stars in our Milky Way alone . amounts to 30 billion. The assumption that our Milky Way contains at least 16 billion planetary systems is consid­ ered admissible by present-day astronomers. If we now try to reduce the figures in question as much as possible and assume that the distances between planetary systems are so regulated that only in one case in a hundred does a planet orbit in the ecosphere of its own sun, that still leaves 180 mil- 16"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"lion planets capable of supporting life. If we further assume that only one planet in a hundred that might support life actually does so, we should still have the figure of 1.8 million planets with life. Let us further suppose that out of every hundred planets with life there is one on which creatures with the same level of intelligence as homo sap iens live. Then even this last supposition gives our Milky Way the vast number of 18,0 00 inhabited planets.\" Since the latest tounts give 100 billion fixed stars in our Milky Way, probability indicates an incomparably higher figure than Dr. Ley puts forward in his cautious calculation. Without quoting fantastic figures or taking unknown galaxies into account, we may surmise that there are 18,000 phinets comparatively close to the earth with conditions es­ sential to life similar to those of our own planet. Yet we can go even further and speculate that if only 1 percent of these 18,000 planets were actually inhabited, there would still be 180 leftl There is no doubt about the existence of planets similar to the earth-with a similar mixture of atmospheric gases, similar gravity, similar flora, and possibly even similar fauna. But is it even essential for the planets that support life to have conditions similar to the earth's? The idea that life can flourish only under terrestrial con­ ditions has been made obsolete by research. It is a mistake to believe that life. cannot exist without water and oxygen. Even on our own earth there are forms of life that need no oxygen. They are called anaerobic bacteria. A given amount of oxygen acts like poison on them. Why should there not be higher forms of life that do not need oxygen? Under the pressure of the new knowledge that is being acquired every day, we shall have to bring our mental world picture up to date. Scientific investigation, concentrated on our earth until very recently, has praised this world of ours as the ideal planet. It is not too hot and not too cold; it has 17"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"plenty of water; there are unlimited quantities of oxygen; organic processes constantly rejuvenate nature. In fact, the assumption that life can exist and develop only on a planet like the earth is untenable. It is estimated that 2,000,000 different species of living creatures live on the earth. Of these-this again is an estimate-I,200,000 are \"known\" scientifically. And among these forms of life known to science there are still a few thousand that ought not to be able to live at all according to current ideas I The premises for life must be thought out and tested anew. For example, one would think that highly radioactive wa­ ter would be free from germs. But there are actually some kinds of bacteria which can adapt themselves to the lethal water that surrounds nuclear reactors. An experiment car­ ried out by biologist Dr. Sanford Siegel sounds eery. He re-created the atmospheric conditions of Jupiter in his labor ­ atory and bred bacteria and mites in this atmosphere, whic h shares none of the prerequisites we have hitherto laid down for \"life.\" Ammonia, methane, and hydrogen did not kill them. The experiments by Dr. Howard Hinton and Dr. Blum, Bristol University entomologists, had equally startling results. The two scientists dried a species of midge for sev­ eral hours at a temperature of 100° C. Immediately after­ ward they immersed their \"guinea pigs\" in liquid helium, which, as is well known, is as cold as space. After heavy irra­ diation they returned the midges to their normal living conditions. The insects continued their biological vital func­ tions and produced perfectly healthy midges. We also know of bacteria that live in volcanoes, of others that eat stone, and some that produce iron. The forest of question marks grows. Experiments are going on at many research centers. New proofs that life is by no means bound to the prerequisites for life on our planet are constantly accumulating. For cen­ turies the world appeared to revolve around the laws and 18"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"conditions that govern life on earth. This conVlctlOn dis­ torted and blurred our way of looking at thingS; it put blink­ ers on scientific investigators, who unhesitatingly accepted our standards and systems of thought when viewing the uni­ verse. Teilhard de Chardin, the epoch-making thinker, sug­ gested that only the fantastic has a chance of being real in the cosmos I . If our way of ,thinking worked the other way around, it would mean that intelligences on another planet took their living conditions as a criterion. If they lived at tempera­ tures of minus 150-200° C, they would think that those temp­ eratures, which are destructive to life as we know it, were es­ sential for life on other planets. That would match up to the logic with which we are trying to illuminate the darkness of our past. We owe it to our self-respect to be rational and objective. At some time or other every daring theory seemed to be a Utopia. How many Utopias have long since become every­ day realities I Of course the examples given here are meant to point out the most farfetched possibilities. Yet once the improbable things that we cannot even conceive of today are shown to be true, as they will be, barriers will fall, allowing free access to the impossibilities the cosmos still conceals. Fu­ ture generations will find all kinds of life that have never been dreamed of in the universe. Even if we are not there to see it, they will have to accept the fact that they are not the only, and certainly not the oldest, intelligences in the cos­ mos. The universe is estimated to be between eight and twelve billion years old. Meteorites bring traces of organic matter under our microscopes. Bacteria millions of years old awake to new life. Floating spores traverse the universe and at some time or other are captured by the gravitational field of a planet. New life has gone on developing in the perpetual cycle of creation for millions of years. Innumerable careful 19"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"examinations of all kinds of stones in all parts of the world prove that the earth's crust was formed about 4,000,000 ,000 years ago. Yes, and all that science knows is that something like man existed 1,000,000 years ago I And out of that gigantic river of time it has managed to dam up only a tiny rivulet of 7,000 years of human history, at the cost of a lot of hard work, many adventures and a great deal of curiosity. But what are 7,000 years of human history compared with thousands of millions of years of the history of the uhiverse? We-the paragons of creation?-took 400,000 years to reach our present state and our present stature. Who can produce concrete proof to show why another planet should not have provided more favorable conditions for the develop­ ment of other Or similar intelligences? Is there any reason why we may not have \"competitors\" on another planet who are equal or superior to us? Are we entitled to discard this possibility? We have done so up to the present. How often the pillars of our wisdom have crumbled into dust I Hundreds and hundreds of generations thought that the earth was flat. The iron law that the sun went around the earth held good for thousands of years. We are still con­ vinced that our eanh is the center of everything, although it has been proved that the earth is an ordinary star of insig­ nificant size, 30,000 light-years from the center of the Milky Way. The time has come for us to admit our insignificance by making discoveries in the infinite unexplored cosmos. Only then shall we realize that we are nothing but ants in the vast state of the universe. And yet our future and our opportunities lie in the universe, where the gods promised they would. Not until we have taken a look into the future shall we be strong and bold enough to investigate our past honestly and impartially. 20"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"2 When Our Spaceship Landed on Earth . . • J ULES VERNE, the grandfather of all science-fiction novel­ ists, has become an accepted writer.

We are now going to describe what might happen on an imaginary journey by spaceship, yet this imaginary journey will be­ come possible in fewer decades than the time it took to con­ tract Jules Verne's crazy notion of a journey around the world in 80 days to a lightning journey of 86 minutes. But let us not think in terms of such short periods of timel Let us assume that our spaceship will leave the earth for an unknown distant sun in 150 years' time. The spaceship would be as big as a present-day ocean liner and would therefore have a: launching weight of about 100,- 000 tons with a fuel load of 99 ,800 tons, i.e, an effective pay­ load of 200 tons.

Yet even this assembly work will become unnecessary in less than two decades, because 21"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"it will be possible to prepare the giant spaceship for launch­ ing on the moon. Besides, the basic research for the rocket propulsion of tomorrow is in full swing. Future rocket mo­ tors will mainly be powered by nuclear fusion and travel at nearly the speed of light. A bold new method, the feasibil­ ity of which has already been shown by physical experiments on individual elementary particles, will be the photon rocket. The fuel carried on board the photon rocket enables the rocket's velocity to approach so close to the speed of light that the effects of relativity, especially the variation in time between launching site and spaceship, can operate to the full. The fuel supplies will be transformed into electromagnetic radiation and ejected as a clustered propulsive jet with the speed of light. Theroetically a spaceship equipped with pho­ ton propulsion can reach 99 percent of the speed of light. At this speed the boundaries of our solar system would be blasted open I An idea that really makes the mind reel. But we who are on the threshold of a new age should remember that the giant strides in technology which our grandfathers experi­ enced were just as staggering in their day: the railways, elec­ tricity, telegraphy, the first car, the first airplane. We our­ selves heard music in the air for the first time; we see color TV; we saw the first launching of spaceships, and American astronauts actually walking on the moon; and we get ne.ws and pictures from satellites that revolve around the earth. Our children's children will go on interstellar journeys and carry out cosmic research in the universities. Let us follow the journey of our imaginary spaceship, whose goal is a distant fixed star. It would certainly be amus­ ing to try to imagine what the crew of the spaceship did to kill time on their journey. Because however vast the distances they covered and however slowly time might crawl along for those left behind on earth, Einstein's theory of relativ­ it, still holds good. It may sound incredible, but time on 22"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"board the spaceship traveling barely below the speed of light actually passes more slowly than on the earth. For example, only 10 years pass for our crew on their flight in the universe, whereas 108 years go by for those who stay at horne. This shift in time between the space travelers and the people on earth can be calculated by the basic rocket equa­ tion worked out by Professor Ackeret: 1 - (1 - t)2w/c v /w ---:- :---: -'-,- .,..-- �:-::- -:--:- wc·ll + (1 - t)2W/c 1 (v = velocity, w = speed of jet, c = speed of light, t = fuel load at launchi ng) At the moment when our spaceship is approaching the star which is its target, the crew will undoubtedly examine planets, fix their position, undertake spectral analyses, measure forces of gravity, and calculate orbits. Lastly they will choose as landing place the planet whose conditions come closest to those of our earth. If our spaceship consists solely of its payload after a journey of, shall we say, 80 light­ years, because all the energy supplies have been used up, the crew will have to replenish the tanks of their spacecraft with fissionable material at their goal. Let us assume, then, that the planet chosen to land on is similar to the earth. I have already said that this assumption is by no means impossible. Let us also venture the suppo­ sition that\" the civilization of the planet visited is in about the same state of development as the earth was 8,000 years ago. Of course, this would all have been confirmed by the instruments on board the spaceship long before the landing. Naturally our space travelers have also picked on a landing site that lies close to a supply of fissionable matter. Their in­ struments show quickly and reliably in which mountain ranges uranium can be found. The landing is carried out according to plan. 23"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Our space travelers see beings making stone tools; they see them hunting and killing game by throwing spears; flocks of sheep and goats are grazing on the steppe; primitive pot­ ters are making simple household utensils. A strange sight to greet our astronauts I But what do the primitive beings on this planet think about the monstrosity that has just landed there and the fig­ ures that climbed out of it? Let us not forget that we too were semisavages 8,000 years ago. So it is not surprising when the semisavages who experience this event bury their faces in the ground and dare not raise their eyes. Until this day they have worshiped the sun and the moon. And now some­ thing earth-shaking has happened: the gods have come down from heaven! From a safe hiding place the inhabitants of the planet watch our space travelers, who wear strange hats with rods on their heads (helmets with antennae); they are amazed when the night is made bright as day (searchlights); they are terrified when the strangers rise effortlessly into the air (rocket belts); they bury their heads in the ground again when weird unknown \"animals\" soar in the air, droning, buzzing, and snorting (helicopters, all-purpose vehicles), and lastly they take flight to the safe refuge of their caves when a frightening boom and rumble resounds from the mountains (a trial explosion). Undoubtedly our astronauts must seem like almighty gods to these primitive peoplel Day by day the space travelers continue their laborious work, and after some time a delegation of priests or medi­ cine men will probably approach the astronauts in order to make contact with the gods. They bring gifts to pay homage to their guests. It is conceivable that our spacemen will rap­ idly learn the language of the inhabitants with the help of a computer and can thank them for the courtesy shown. Yet although they can explain to the savages in their own lan- 24"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"guage that no gods have landed, that no higher beings worthy of adoration have paid a visit, it has no effect. Our primitive friends simply do not believe it. The space travelers came from other stars; they obviously have tremendous power and the ability to perform miracles. They must be godsl There is also no point in the spacemen's trying to explain any help they may offer. It is all far beyond the comprehension of these people who have been so terrifyingly invaded. Although it is impossible to imagine all the things that might take place from the day of landing onward, the fol­ lowing points might well figure on a preconceived plan: Part of the population would be won over and trained to help search a crater formed by an explosion for fissionable matter needed for the return to earth. The most intelligent of .the inhabitants would be elected \"king.\" As a visible sign of his power, he would be given a radio set through which he could contact and address the \"gods\" at any time. Our astronauts would try to teach the natives the simplest forms of civilization and some moral concepts, in order to make the development of a social order possible. A few spe­ cially selected women would be fettilized by the astronauts. Thus a new race would arise that skipped a stage in natural evolution. We know from our own development how long it would take before this new race became space experts. Con­ sequently, before the astronauts began their return flight to earth, they would leave behind clear and visible signs which only a highly technical, mathematically based society would be able to understand much, much later. Any attempt to warn our prot�g� of dangers 'in store would have little chance of success. Even if we showed them the most horrifying films of terrestrial wars and atomic explosions, it would not prevent the beings living on this 25"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"planet from committing the same follies any more than it now stops (almost) the whole of sentient humanity from constantly playing with the burning flame of war.

They will turn the presents and implements and everything that the space travelers left behind into holy relics. 1£ our friends have mastered writing, they may make a record of what happened: uncanny, weird, miraculous. Then their texts will relate-and drawings will show-that gods in golden clothes were there in a flying boat that landed with a tremendous din. They will write about chariots which the gods drove over land and sea, and of terrifying weapons that were like lightning, and they will recount that the gods promised to return. They will hammer and chisel in the rock pictures of what they had once seen: shapeless giants with helmets and rods on their heads, carrying boxes in front of their chests; balb on which indefinable beings sit and ride through the air; staves from which rays are shot out as if from a sun; strange shapes, resembling giant insects, which were vehicles of some sort. There are no limits to the fantasy of the illustrations that result from the visit of our spaceship. We shall see later what traces the \"gods\" who visited the earth in our remote antiq­ uity engraved on the tablets of the past. It is quite easy to sketch the subsequent development of the planet that our spaceship visited. The inhabitants have learned a lot by watching the \"gods\" surreptitiously; the place on which the spaceship stood will be declared holy ground, a place of pilgrimage, where the heroic deeds of the gods will be praised in song.

Our world picture, which is already almost frozen into immobili ty, begins to thaw. New working hypotheses need new criteria. For example, in the future, archaeology can no longer be simply a matter of excav ation. The mere collec­ tion and classification of finds is no longer adequate. Other branches of science will have to be consulted and made use of if a reliable picture of our past is to be drawn. S o let us enter the new world of the improbable with an open mind and bursting with curiosity! Let us try to take possession of the inherit ance the \"gods\" have bequeathed to us. At the beginning of .the eighteenth century ancient maps which had belonged to an officer in the Turkish navy, Ad­ miral Piri Reis, were found in the Topkapi Palace. Two atlases preserved in the Berlin State Library which contain exact reproductions of the Medit erran ean and the region around the Dead Sea also came from Piri Reis. All these maps were handed over to American cartog­ rapher Arlington H. Mallerey for examination . Mallerey confinned the remarkable fact that all the geogra phical data were present but not d r awn in the right places. He sought the help of Mr. Walters, cartographer in the V.S. Navy Hy­ drographic Bureau. Mallerey and Walters constructed a grid and transferred the maps to a modern globe. They made a sensational discovery. The maps were absolutely accurate­ and not only as regards the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. The coasts of North and South America and even the 30"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"contours of the Antarctic were also precisely delineated on Piri Reis' maps. The maps not only reproduced the outlines of the continents but also showed the topography of the in­ teriors! Mountain ranges, mountain peaks, islands, rivers. and plateaus were drawn in with extreme accuracy. In 1957, the Geophysical Year, the maps were handed over to Jesuit Father Lineham, who is both director of the Weston Observatory and a cartographer in the U.S. Navy. After scrupulous tests Father Lineham, too, could but con­ firm that the maps were fantastically accurate-even about regions which we have scarcely explored today. What is more, the mountain ranges in the Antarctic, which already figure on Reis' maps, were not discovered until 1952. They have been covered in ice for hundreds of years, and our present­ day maps have been drawn with the aid of echo-sounding apparat us. The latest studies of Professor Charles H. Hapgood and mathematician Richard W. Strachan give us some more shat­ tering inform ation. Comparison with modem photographs of our globe taken from satellites showed that the originals of Piri Reis' maps must have been aerial photographs taken from a very great height. How can that be explained? A spaceship hovers high above Cairo and points its camera straight downward. When the film is developed, the fol­ lowing picture would emerge : everything that is in a radius of about 5,000 miles of Cairo is reproduced correctly. be­ cause it lies directly below the lens. But the countries and continents become increasingy distorted the farther we move our eyes from the center of the picture. Why is this? Owing to the spherical shape of the earth, the continents away from the center \"sink downwar d.\" South America, for example, appears strangely distorted lengthways, exactly as it does on the Piri Reis maps! And exactly as it does on the photographs taken from the American lunar probes . There are one or two questions that can be answered 31"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"quickly. Unquestionably our forefathers did not draw these maps. Yet there is no doubt that the maps must have been made with the most modem technical aid-from the air. How are we to explain that? Should we be satisfied with the legend that a god gave them to a high priest? Or should we simply take no notice of them and pooh-pooh the \"mir­ acle\" because the maps do not fit into our mental world pic­ ture? Or should we boldly stir up a wasps' nest and claim that this cartography of our globe was carried out from a high-flying aircr aft or from a spaceship? Admittedly the Turkish admiral's maps are not originals. They are copies of copies of copies. Yet even if .the maps dated from only the eighteenth century, when they were found, these facts are just as unexplainable. Whoever made them must have been able to fly and also to take photographs! Not far from the sea, in the Peruvian spurs of the Andes, lies the ancient C ity of Nazca. The Palpa Valley contains a strip of level ground some 37 miles long and I mile wide that is scattered with bits of stone resembling pieces of rusty iron. The inhabitants call this region pampa, although any vegetation is out of the question there. If you fly over this territory-the plain of Nazca -you can make out gigan tic lines, laid out geometrically, some of which run parallel to each other, while others intersect or are surrounded by large trapezoidal areas. The archaeologists say that they are Inca roads . A preposterous ideal Of what use to the Incas were roads that ran parallel to each other? That intersected? That were laid out in a plain and came to a sudden end? Naturall y typical Nazca pottery and ceramics are found here, too. But it is surely overs implifying things to attrib­ ute the geometri cally arranged lines to the Nazca culture for that reason alone. No serious excavations were carried out in this area until 32"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"1952. There is no established chronology for all the things that were found. Only now have the lines and geometrical �gures been measured. The results clearly confirm the hy­ pothesis that the lines were laid out according to astronomical plans. Professor Alden Mason, a specialist in Peruvian antiq­ uities, suspects signs of a kind of religion in the alignments, and perhaps a calendar as well. Seen from the air, the clear-cut impression that the 37- mile-long plain of Nazca made on me was that of an airfield I What is so farfetched about the idea? Research (= knowledge) does not become possible until the thing that is to be investigated has actually been found I Once it is found, it is tirelessly polished and trimmed until it has become a stone that- miraculously enough-fits exactly into the existing mosaic. Classical archaeology does not admit that the pre-Inca peoples could have had a perfect surveying technique. And the theory that aircraft could have existed in antiquity is sheer humbug to them. In that case, what purpose did the lines at Nazca serve? According to my way of thinking, they could have been laid out on their gigantic scale by working from a model and using a system of coordin ates, or they could also have been built accord ing to instructions from an aircraft. It is not yet possible to say with certainty whether the plain of Nazca was ever an airfield. If iron was used it will certainly not be found, because there is no prehistoric iron. Metals corrode in a few years ; stone never corrodes. What is wrong with the idea that the lines were laid out to say to the \"gods \": \"Land herel Everything has been prepared as you order ed\"? The builders of the geometrical figures may have had no idea what they were doing. But perhaps they knew perfectly well what the \"gods\" needed in order to land. Enormous drawings that were undoubtedly meant as sig­ nals for a being floating in the air are found on mountain- 33"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"sides in many parts of Peru. What other purpose could they have served? One of the most peculiar drawings is carved on the high red wall of the cliffs in the Bay of Pisco. If you arrive by sea, you can make out a figure nearly 820 feet high from a dis­ tance of more than 12 miles. If you play at \"It looks like .. . ,\" your immediate reaction is that this sculptor's work looks like a gigantic trident or a colossal three-branched candlestick. And a long rope was found on the central column of this stone sign. Did it serve as a pendulum in the past? To be honest, we must admit that we are groping in the dark when we try to explain it. It cannot be meaningfully included in existing dogmas, which does not mean to say that there may not be some trick by which scholars could conjure this phenomenon too into the great mosaic of ac­ cepted archaeological thinking. But what can have induced the pre-Inca peoples to build the fanta stic lines, the landing strips, at Nazca? What mad­ ness could have driven them to create the 820-foot-high stone signs on the red cliffs south of Lima? These tasks would have taken decades without modern machines and appliances. Their whole activity would have been senseless if the end product of their efforts had not been meant as signs to beings approaching them from great heights. The stimulating question still has to be answered: Why did they do all this if they had no idea that fiying beings actually existed? The identification of finds can no longer remain a matter for archaeology alone. A council of scientists from different fields of research would certainly bring us close to the solu­ tion of the puzzle. Exchange of opinions and dialogue would definitely produce illuminating insights. Because scientists do not take the posing of such questions seriously, there is a danger that research will come to no definite conclu­ sions. Space travelers in the gray mists of time? An inad- 34"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"missible question to academic scientists. Anyone who asks questions like that ought to see a psychiatrist. But the questions are there, and questions, thank heavens. have the impertinent quality of hovering in the air until they are answered. And there are many inadmissible ques­ tions like that. For example, what would people say if there were a calendar which gave the equinoxes, the astro­ nomical seasons, the positions of the moon for every hour and also the movements of the moon, even taking the rotation of the earth into account? That is no mere hypothetical question. This calendar exists. It was found in the dry mud at Tia huanaco. It is a disconcert­ ing find. It yields irrefu table facts and proves-can our self­ assurance admit such a proof? -that the beings who pro­ duced, devised, and used the calendar had a higher cul ture than ours. Another quite fantastic discovery was the Great Idol. This single block of red sandstone is longer than 24 feet and weighs 20 tons. It was found in the Old Temple. Again we have a contradiction between the superb quality and pre­ cision of the hundreds of symbols all over the idol and the primitive technique used for the building housing it. In­ deed it is called the Old Temple because of the primitive technique. H. S. Bellamy and P. Allan have given a closely reasoned inte rpre tation of the symbols in their book The Great Idol of Tiahuan;Lco. They conclude that the symbols record an enormous body of astron omical knowledge and are based, as a matter of fact, on a round earth. They conclude that the record fits perfectly Hoerbiger's Theory of Satellites, published in 1927, five years before the idol was discover ed. This theory postulates that a satellite was captured by the earth. As it was pulled toward the earth 35"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"it slowed down the speed of the earth's revolutions. It finally disintegrated and was replaced by the moon. The symbols on the idol exactly record the astronomical phenomena which would accompany this theory at a time when the satellite was making 425 revolutions around the earth in a year of 288 days. They are forced to conclude that the idol records the state of the heavens 27,000 years ago. They write, \"Generally, the idol inscriptions give the impression ... that it had been devised also as a record for future generatio ns.\" Here indeed is an object of great antiquity which demands a better explanation than \"an ancient god.\" If this interpre­ tation of the symbols can be substantiated, we must ask: Was the astronomical knowledge really amassed by people who still had a great deal to learn about buildi ng, or did it come from extraterres trial sources? In either case the exist­ ence of such a sophisticated body of knowledge 27,000 years ago, demonstrated on both the idol and the calendar, is a staggering thought. The city of Tiahuanaco teems with secrets. The city lies at a heikht of more than 13,000 feet, and it is miles from anywhere. Starting from eUICO, Peru, you reach the city and the excavation sites after several days' travel by rail and boat. The plateau looks like the landscape of an unknown planet. Manual labor is torture for anyone who is not a native. The atmospheric pressure is about half as low as it is at sea level and the oxygen content of the air is correspondingly small. And yet an enormous city stood on this plateau. There are no authentic traditions about Tiahuanaco . Per­ haps we should be glad that in this case acceptable answers cannot be reached by leaning on the crutch of hereditary orthodox learning. Over the ruins, which are incredibly old (how old we do not yet know), lies the mist of the past, ig­ norance and mystery. 36"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Hlocks of sandstone weighing 100 tons are topped with other 60-ton blocks for walls. Smooth surfaces with extremely accurate chamfers join enormous squared stones which are held together with copper clamps. In addition, all the stone­ work is exceptionally neatly executed. Holes 8 feet long, whose purpose has not been explained thus far, are found in blocks weighing 10 tons. Nor do the 16�-foot-long, worn­ down flagstones cut out of one piece contribute to the solution of the mystery that Tiahu anaco conceals. Stone water con­ duits, 6 feet long and 1 � feet wide, are found scattered about on the ground like toys, obviously by a catastrophe of tre­ mendous dimensions. These finds stagger us by their accurate workman ship. Had our forefathers at Tiahuanaco nothing better to do than spend year5---'-without tool5---'-fashioning water conduits of such precision that our modern concrete conduits seem the work of mere bunglers in comparison? In a courtyard which has now been restored there is a jum­ ble of stone heads which, on closer observa tion, appears to be made up of the most varied races, for some of the faces have narrow lips, and some swollen; some long noses, and some hooked; some delicate ears, and some thick; some soft features, and some angular. And some of the heads wear strange helmets. Are all these unfamiliar figures trying to convey a message that we cannot or will not understand, in­ hibited as we are by stubborn ness and prejudice? One of the great archaeological wonders of South America is the monolithic Gate of the Sun at Tiahua nac<r-a gigan­ tic sculpture, nearly 10 feet high and 16� feet wide, carved out of a single block. The weight of this piece of masonry is estimated at more than 10 tons. Forty-eight square figures in three rows flank a being who represents a flying god. What does legend say about the mysterious city of Tia­ huanaco? It tells of a golden spaceship that came from the stars; in it came a woman, whose name was Oryana, to fulfill the task of 37"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"becoming the Great Mother of the earth. Oryana had only four fingers , which were webbed. Great Mother Oryana gave birth to 70 earth children, then she returned to the stars. We do, in fact, find rock drawings of beings with four fingers at Tiahuanaco. Their age cannot be determined. No one from any of the ages known to us ever saw Tiahuanaco when it was not in ruins. What secret does this city conceal? What message from other worlds awaits its solution on the Bolivian plateau? There is no plausible explanation for the beginning or the end of this culture. Of course, this does not stop some archae­ ologists from making the bold and self·confident assertion that the site of the ruins is 3,000 years old. They date this age from a couple of ridiculous little clay figures, which cannot possibly have anything in common with the age of the monolith. Scholars make things very easy for themselves . They stick a couple of old potsherds together, search for one or two adjacent cultures, stick a label on the restored find and-hey, prestol--once again everything fits splendidly into the approved pattern of thought. This method is obviously very much simpler than chancing the idea that an embarrass­ ing technical skill might have existed or the thought of space travelers in the distant past. That would be complicating matters unnecessarily. Nor must we forget Sacsahuamanl I am not referring here to the fantastic Inca defense works which lie a few feet above presen t day Cuzco, nor to the monolithic blocks weigh­ ing more than 100. tons, nor to the terrace walls, more than 1, 500 feet long and 54 feet wide, in front of which tourists stand and take souvenir snapshots today. I am referring to the unknown Sacsah uaman, which lies a mere half mile or so from the well-known Inca fortress. Our imagination is unable to conceive what technical resources our forefa thers used to extract a monolithic rock 38"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"of more than 100 tons from a quarry and then transport it and work it in a distant spot. But when we are confronted with a block with an estimated weight of 20,000 tons, our imagination, made rather blase by the technical achievements of today, is given its severest shock. On the way back from the fortifications of Sacsahuaman, in a crater in the mountain­ side, a few hundred yards away, the visitor comes across a monstrosity. It is a single stone block the size of a four-story house. It has been impeccably dressed in the most craftsman­ like way; it has steps and ramps and is adorned with spirals and holes. Surely the fashioning of this unprecedented stone block cannot have been merely a bit of leisure activity for the Incas? Surely it is much more likely that it served some as yet inexplicable purpose? To make the solution of the puzzle even more difficult the whole monstrous block stands on its head. So the steps run downward from the roof; the holes point in different directions like the indentations of a grenade; strange depressipns, shaped rather like chairs, seem to hang floating in space. Who can imagine that human hands and human endeavor excavated, transported, and dressed this block? What power overturned it? What titanic forces were at work here? And to what end? Still flabbergasted by this stone monstrosity, the vIsitor finds, barely 900 yards away, rock vitrifications of a kind that ought to be possible only through the melting of stone at extremely high temperatures. The surprised visitor is promptly told that the rock was ground down by glaciers. This explanation is ridiculous. A glacier, like every flowing mass, would logically flow down to one side. This property of matter is hardly likely to have changed just at the time when the vitrifications took place. In any case, it can scarcely be assumed that the glacier flowed down in six different di­ rections over an area of some 18,000 square yardsl 39"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Sacsahuaman and Tiahuanaco conceal a great number of prehistorical mysteries for which superficial but quite un­ convincing explanations are hawked around.

When will something d�cisive be done to give a convinc­ ing answer to the prehistoric puzzles? At Tiahua naco there are artificial overgrown hills, the \"roofs\" of which are abso­ lutely level over an area of 4,784 square yards. It seems highly probable that buildings are concealed beneath them. So far no trench has been dug through the chain of hills, no spade is at work to solve the mystery. Admittedly, money is scarce. Yet the traveler often sees soldiers and officers who are ob­ viously at a loss for something useful to do. What is wrong with letting a company of soldiers carry out excavations un­ der expert supervision? Money is available for so many other things in the world. Research for the future is of burning importance. As long as our past is undiscovered, one entry in the account for the future remains blank. Cannot the past help us to reach tech­ nical solutions which will not have to be found for the first time because they already existed in antiquity? If the urge to discover our past is not sufficient incentive to set modern intensive research work in motion, perhaps the slide rule could be usefully employed. So far, at all events, no scientist has been asked to use the most modern apparatus to investigate radiation at Tiahua naco, Sacsahua­ man, the legendary Sodom, or in the Gobi Desert. Cunei­ form texts and tablets from Ur, the oldest books of mankind, tell without exception of \"gods\" who rode in the heavens in ships, of \"gods\" who came from the stars, possessed terrible weapons, and returned to the stars. Why do we not seek them out, the old \"gods \"? Our radio-as tronomers send signals into 40"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"the universe to make contact with unknown intelli gences. Why don't we first or simultaneously seek the traces of un­ known intell igences on our own earth, which is so much closer? For we are not groping blindly in a dark. room-the traces are there for all to see. Some 2,000 years before our era the Sumerians began to record the glorious past of their people. Today we still do not know where this people came from. But we do know that the Sumerians brought with them a superior advanced culture which they forced upon the still semi barbarian Semites. We also know that they always sought their godS on mountain peaks and that if there were no peaks in the regions they inhabited they erected artificial \"mountains\" on the plains. Their astronomy was incredibly highly de­ veloped. Their observatories achieved estimates of the rota­ tion of the moon which differ from present-day estimates by no more than 0.4 seconds. In addition to the fabulous Epic of Gilgamesh, about which I shall have more to say la­ ter, they have left us one thing that is quite sensational. On the hill of Kuyunjik (former Nineveh) a calculation was found with the final result in our notation of 195,955,200,- 000,000. A number with fifteen digits ! Our oft-qu oted and extensively studied ancestors of Western culture, the Greeks, never rose above the figure 10,000 during the most brilliant period of their civilization. Anything beyond that was simply described as \"infinite.\" The old cuneiform inscriptions credit the Sumerians with a literally fantastic span of life. Thus the ten original kings ruled for a total of 456,000 years, and the twenty-three kings who had the arduous task of reconstru ction after the Flood still managed to hold the reins of gover nment for a total of 24,510 years, 3 months, and 3Y2 days. Periods of years that are quite incomprehensible to our way of thinking, although the names of all the rulers exist in long lists, neatly perpe tuated on seals and coins. What 41"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"would happen if here too we dared to take off our blinkers and look at the old things with fresh eyes. the eyes of today? Let us suppose that foreign astronauts visited the territory of the Sumerians thousands of years ago. Let us assume that they laid the foundations of the civilization and culture of the Sumerians and then returned to their own planet. after giving this stimulus to development. Let us postulate that curiosity drove them back to the scene of their pioneer work every hundred terres trial years to check the results of their experiment. By the standards of our present-day expecta­ tion of life the same astronauts could easily have survived for 500 terrestrial years. The theory of relativity shows that the astronauts would have aged only about forty years during the outward and return flight in a spaceship that had travel ed just under the speed of lightl Over the centuries the Sumer­ ians would have built towers. pyramids. and houses with every comfort ; they would have sacrificed to their gods and awaited their return. And after hundreds of terrestrial years they actually did return to them. \"And then came the Flood. and after the Flood kingship came down from heaven once again.\" it says in a Sumerian cuneifonn inscription. In what form did the Sumerians imagine and depict their \"gods\"? Sumerian mythology and some Akkadian tablets and pictures provide information about this. The Sumerian \"gods \" were not anthropomorphic. and every symbol of a god was also connected with a star. Stars are depicted in Akkadian picture tablets as we might draw them today. The only remarkable thing is that these stars are circl ed by plan­ ets of various sizes. How did the Sumerians. who lacked our techniques for observing the heavens. know that a fixed star has planets? There are sketches in which people wear stars on their heads. while others ride on balls with wings . There is one picture that instantly reminds one of a model of an atom: a circle of ba lls arranged next to one another that radi­ ate. but are not surrou nded by rays. If we look at the legacy 42"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"of the Sumerians with \"space eyes,\" it teems with questions and enigmas beside which the terrors of the deep and the wonders of the heavens pale into insignificance. Here are only a few curiosities from the same geogra phi­ cal area: Drawings of spirals, a r arit y 6,000 ye a rs ago, at Geoy Tepe. A flint industry credited with an age of 40,000 y ears at Gar Kobeh. Similar finds at Barados tian estimated to be 30,000 years old. Figures, tombs, and stone implements at Tepe Asiab dated 13,000 years back. Petrified excrement, possibl y not of human origin, fo und at the same place. Tools and stone engravers found at Karim Shahir. Flint weapons and tools excavated at Barda Balka. Skeletons of grown men and a child found in the cave of Shandiar. They were dated (by the C-14 method) to about 45,000 B.G. The list could be considerably enlarged, and every fact would strengthen the assertion that a mixture of primitive men lived in the geogra phical territory of Sumer about 40,- 000. years ago. Suddenly, for reasons inexplicable so far, the Sumerians were there with their astronomy, their culture, and their technology. The conclusions to be drawn from the previous presence on earth of unknown visitors from the universe are still purely speculative. We can imagine that \"gods\" appeared who collected the semisavage peoples in the region of Sumer around them and transmitted some of their knowledge to them. The figurines and statues that stare at us today from the glass cases of museums show a racial mixture, with goggle eyes, domed foreheads, narrow lips, and general ly long, straigh t noses. A picture that is very difficult to fit into the schematic system of thought and its concept of primitive peoples. 43"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Visitors from th� universe in remote antiquity?

In Helwan there is a piece of doth, a fabric so fine that today it could be woven only in a special factory with great technical know-how and experience. Electric dry batteries, which work on the galvanic principle, are on display in the Baghd � d Museum.

A Utopian archaeological year is due, during which archaeologists, physicists, chemists, geologists, metallurgists, and all the corresponding branches of these sciences ought to concentrate their efforts on one single question: Did our forefathers receive visits from outer space? For example, a metallurgist would be able to tell an arch­ aeologist quickly and concisely how complicated the produc­ tion of aluminum is. Is it not conceivable that a physicist might instantly recognize a fonnula in a rock drawing? A chemist with his highly developed apparatus might be able to confinn the assumption that obelisks were extracted from the rock by wetting wooden wedges or using unknown acids. The geologist owes us a whole series of answers to questions about what is of signific ance in certain Ice Age deposits.

Anyone who spoke about satellites in scientific circles twenty years ago was committing a kind of academic suicide. Today artificial heavenly bodies, namely satellites, revolve around the sun; they have photographed Mars and landed smoothly on the moon and Venus, radio­ ing first-class photographs of the unknown landscape back to earth with their (tourist) cameras . When the first such photos were radioed to earth from Mars in the spring of 1958, the strength used was 0.000,000,000,000,000 ,01 watts, an al­ most incred ibly weak amount of current.

We know that our ingenuous and primitive forefathers did not know what to make of the astronauts' superior technol­ ogy.

They still scratch their divine figures and their wonderful ships coming from heaven on cliffs and cave walls. In this way these savage peoples have actually pre­ served for us what we are seeking today. Cave drawings in Kohistan, France, North America, and Southern Rhodesia, in the Sahara and Peru, as well as Chile, all contri bute to our theory. Henri Lhote, a French scholar, discovered at Tassili, in the Sahara, several hundred walls painted with many thousands of pictures of animals and men, including figures in short elegant coats. They carry sticks and indefinable chests on the sticks. Next to the ani­ mal paintings we are astonished by a being in a kind of diver's suit. The great god Mars-so Lhote christened him -was originally more than 18 feet high; but the \"savage \" who bequeathed the drawing to us can scarcely have been as primitive as we should like him to be if everything is to fit neatly into the old pattern of thought. After all, the \"savage\" obviously used a scaffolding to be able to draw in propor­ tion like that, for there have been no shifts in ground level in these caves during the last few millennia. Without over­ stretching my imagination, I got the impression that the great god Mars is depicted in a space or diving suit. On his heavy, powerful shoulders rests a helmet which is connected to his torso by a kind of joint. There are a number of slits on the helmet where mouth and nose would normally be. One would readily believe that it was the result of chance or even in the pictorial imagination of the prehistoric \"artist\" if this picture were unique. But there are several of these clumsy figures with the same equipment at Tassili, and very similar figures have also been found on rock faces in the United States, in the Tulare region of California. I should like to be generous, and I am willing to postulate that the primitive artists were unskilled and portrayed the 48"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"figures in this rather crude way because it was the best they could do. But in that case how could the same primitive cave dwellers depict animals and normal human beings to perfec tion? It seems more credible to me to assume that the \"attists\" were perfec tly capable of drawing what they actu­ ally saw. In Inyo County. California. a geometrical figure in a cave drawing is recognizable- without overstraining the imagination-as a normal slide rule in a double frame. The archaeological opinion is that the drawing shows figures of the gods. An animal of unknown species with gigantic upright horns on its head appears on a pottery vessel found at Siyak in Iran. Why not? But both horns display five spirals to left and right. If you imagine two rods with large porcelain in­ sulators. that is roughly what this drawing looks like. What do the archaeologists say to that? Quite simply that they are symbols of a god. Gods are of great value. People explain a great deal-c ertainly everyt hing that is unexplained-by referring to their unknowableness and supernaturalness. In this world of the undemonstrable they can live in peace. Every figurine that is found. every artifact that is put together. every figure that can be restored from fragments -they are all instantly associated with some ancient reli­ gion or other. But if an object cannot be fitted into any of the existing religions, even forcibly, some new crackpot old cult is rapidly conjured up-like a rabbit out of a top hatl The sum works out once again. But what if the frescoes. at Tassili or in the United States or in France. actually reproduce what the primitive peoples saw? What should we say if the spirals on the rods really de­ picted antennae, just as the primitive peoples had seen them on the unfamiliar gods? Isn't it possible that things which ought not to exist do in fact exist? A \"savag e,\" who never­ theless was skillful enough to execute wall paintings, cannot really have been so savage. The wall drawing of the White 49"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Lady of Brandenberg (South Africa) could be a twentieth­ century painting. She wears a short-sleeved pullover, closely fitting breeches, and gloves, garters and slippers. The lady is not alone; behind her stands a thin man with a strange prickly rod in his hand and wearing a very complicated hel­ met with a kind of visor. This would be accepted as a mod­ ern painting without hesitation, but the snag is that we are dealing with a cave drawing. All the gods who are depicted in cave drawings in Sweden and Norway have uniform indefinable heads. The archae­ ologists say that they are animal heads . Yet isn't there some­ thing rather absurd about worshiping a \"god\" whom one also slaughters and eats? We often see ships with wings and even more frequ ently typical antennae. Figures in bulky suits occur again in Val Camonica (Brescia, Italy) , and, annoyingly enough, they also have horns on their heads. I am not going so far as to claim that the Italian cave dwellers shuttled backward and forward between North America or Sweden, the Sahara and Spain (Ciudad Real), to transmit their illustrative talentS and ideas. Yet the awkward question is left hanging in the air­ why did the primitive people create figures in bulky suits with antennae on their heads independently of each other? I would not waste a word on these unexplained oddities if they existed in only one place in the world. But they are found almost everywhere. As soon as we look at the past with our present-day gaze and use the fantasy of our technological age to fill up the gaps in it, the veils that shroud the dar!tness begin to lift. In the next chapter, a study of ancient holy books will help me to make my theory such a credible reality that in the long run the investigators of our past will no longer be able to evade the revolutionary questions. 50"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"4 Was God an Astronaut? T HE Bible is full of secrets and contradictions . Genesis, for example, begins with the creation of the earth, which is reported with absolute geological accura cy. But how did the chronicler know that minerals preceded plants and plants preceded animals ? \"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likenes s,\" we read in Genesis 1: 26. Why does God speak in the plural? Why does he say \"us,\" not \"me,\" why \"our,\" and not \"my\"? One would think that the one and only God ought to address mankind in the singu­ lar, not in the plural. \"And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose\" (Genesis 6: 1-2). Who can tell us what sons of God took the daughters of men to wife? Ancient Israel had a single sacrosanct God. Where do the \"sons of God\" come from? \"There were giants in the earth in those days; and also 51"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown \" (Genesis 6:4). Once again we have the sons of God, who interbreed with human beings. Here, too, we have the first mention of giants. \"Giants\" keep on cropping up in all parts of the globe: in the mythology of East and West, in the sagas of TIahuanaco and the epics of the Eskimos. \"Giants\" haunt the pages of almost all ancient books. So they must have existed . What sort of creatures were they, these \"giant s\"? Were they our forefathers, who built the gigantic build ings and effortlessly manhandled the monoliths, or were they technically skilled space travelers from another star? One thing is cer­ tain. The Bible speaks of \"giants\" and describes them as \"sons of God,\" and these \"sons of God\" breed with the daugh­ ters of men and multiply. We are given a very exciting and detailed account of the catastro phe of Sodom and Gomorrah in Genesis 19: 1-28. Two angels came to Sodom in the evening when father Lot was sitting near the town gate. Obviously Lot was ex­ pecting these \"angels,\" who soon proved to be men, be­ cause he recognized them at once and hospitably invited them to spend the night in his house. The men of the town, says the Bible, wanted to \"know\" the strangers . But the two strangers were able to dispel the local playboys' sexual lust with a single gesture. They smote the mischief ·makers with blindness. Accor ding to Genesis 19: 12-14, the \"angels\" told Lot to take his wife, sons, daughters, sons-in-law, and daughters-in­ law out of the town with all speed, for, they warned him, it would be destroyed very soon. The family was unwilling to believe this strange warning and took the whole thing for one of father Lot's bad jokes. And Genesis contin ues: \"And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened 52"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two .daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city. And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his-hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city. And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be con­ sumed. . . . Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any- thing till thou be come thither.\" - Accord ing to this report, there is no doubt that the two strangers, the \"angels,\" possessed a power unknown to the inhabitants. The suggestive urgency, the speed with which they drove the Lot family on, also makes us think. When father Lot tarried, they pulled him along by the hands. They had to get away in a matter of minutes. Lot, they ordered, must go into the mountains and he must not turn around. Nevertheless, Lot does not seem to have had unlimited re­ spect for the \"angels,\" because he keeps on making objec­ tions: \". . . I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die.\" A little later the angels say that they cannot do anything for him if he does not go with them. What actually happened at Sodom? We cannot imagine that almighty God is tied down to a timetable. Then why were his \"angels \" in such a hurry? Or was the destru ction of the city by some power or other fixed to the very minute? Had the countdown already begun and did the \"angels\" know about it? In that case the moment of destruction would obviously have been imminent. Was there no simpler method of bringing the Lot family to safety? Why did they have to go into the mountains at all costs? And why on earth should they be forbidden to look around again? Admittedly these are awkward questions about a serious matter. But since the dropping of two atomic bombs on 53"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Japan, we know the kind of damage such bombs cause and that living creatures exposed to direct radiation die or be­ come incurably ill. Let us imagine for a moment that Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed according to plan, i.e., delib­ erately, by a nuclear explos ion. Perhaps-let us speculate a little further-the \"angels\" simply wanted to destroy some dangerous fissionable material and at the same time to make sure of wiping out a human brood they found unpleasant. The time for the destruction was fixed. Those who were to escape it-such as the Lot family-had to stay a few miles from the center of the explosion in the mountains, for the rock faces would naturally absorb the powerful dangerous rays . And-we all know the story- Lot's wife turned around and looked straight at the atomic sun. Nowadays no one is surprised that she fell dead on the spot. \"Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire .... \" And this is how the account of the catastrophe ends (Genesis 19: 27- 28) : \"And Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord: And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, 10, the smoke of the countr y went up as the smoke of a furnace.\" We may be as religious as our fathers, but we are certainly less credulous. With the best will in the world we cannot im­ agine an omnipotent, ubiquitous, infinitely good God who is above all concepts of time and yet does not know what is going to happen. God created man and was satisfied with his work. However, he seems to have repented of his deed later, because this same creator decided to destroy mankind. It is also difficult for enlightened children of this age to think of an infinitely good Father who gives preference to \"favorite children,\" such as Lot's family, over countless others. The Old Testament gives some impressive descriptions in which 54"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"God alone or his angels fly straight down from heaven mak­ ing a tremendous noise and issuing clouds of smoke. One of the most original descri ptions of such incidents comes to us from the prophet Ezekiel: \"Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the cap­ tives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened . . . And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the color of amber, out of the midst of the fire. Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appeara nce; they had the likeness of a man. And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings. And their· feet were straight feet; and the sale of their feet was like the sale of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the color of burnished brass.\" Ezekiel gives precise details of the landing of this vehicle. He descri bes a craft that comes from the north, emitting rays and gleaming and raising a gigantic cloud of desert sand. Now the God of the Old Testament was supposed to be omnipotent. Then why does this almighty God have to come hurtling up from a particular direction? Cannot he be anywhere he wants without all this noise and fuss? Let us follow Ezekiel's eyewitness account a little further: \"Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces. The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the color of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: .and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel. When they went they went upon their four sides: and they turned not as they went. As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadfu l; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four. And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when 55"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.\" The descri ption is astonishingly good. Ezekiel says that each wheel was in the middle of another one. An op.tical illusion I To our present way of thinking what he saw was one of those special vehicles the Americans use in the desert and swampy terrain. Ezekiel observed that the wheels rose from the ground simultaneously with the winged creatures. He was quite right. Naturally the wheels of a multipu rpose ve­ hicle, say an amphibious helicopter, do not stay on the ground when it takes off. More from Ezekiel : \"Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee.\" The narrator heard this voice and hid -his face in the ground in fear and trembling. The strange apparitions ad­ dressed Ezekiel as \"son of man\" and wanted to talk to him. The account goes on: \". . . and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the Lord from his place. I heard also the noise of the wings of the liv­ ing creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing.\" In addition to his precise description of the vehicle, Ezekiel also noted the noise the novel monstros ity made when it left the ground. He likens the din made by the wings and the wheels to a \"great rushing.\" Surely this suggests that this is an eyewitness account? The \"gods \" spoke to Ezekiel and told him that it was his task to restore law and order to the country. They took him with them in their vehicle and con­ finned that they had not yet forsaken the country. This experience made a strong impression on Ezekiel, for he never tires of describing the weird vehicle. On three more occa­ sions he says that each wheel was in the middle of a wheel and that the four wheels could go \"on their four sides ... and turned not as they went.\" And he was particularly im­ pressed by the fact that the whole body of the vehicle, the 56"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"backs, the hands, the wings, and even the wheels were \"full of eyes.\" The \"gods\" reveal the purpose and goal of their journey to the chronicler later when they tell him that he is living in the midst of a \"rebellious house\" which has eyes to see and sees not, ears to hear and hears not. Once he has been enlightened about his countrymen, there follow, as in all de­ scriptions of such landings, advice and directions for law and order, as well as hints for creating a proper civilization. Ezekiel took the task very seriously and handed on the in­ structions of the \"gods .\" Once again we are confronted with all ,kinds of questions. Who spoke to Ezekiel? What sort of beings were they? They were certainly not \"gods\" in the traditional sense of the word, or they would not have needed a vehicle to move from one place to another. This kind of locomotion seems to me to be quite incompatible with the idea of an almighty God. In this connection, there is another technical invention in the Book of Books, which is worth while examining impar­ tially. In Exodus 15: 10, Moses relates the exact instructions which \"God\" gave for building the Ark of the Covenant. The directions are given to the very inch, how and where staves and rings are to be fitted, and from what alloy the metals are to be made. The instructions were meant to en­ sure that everything was carried out exactly as \"God\" wanted it. He warned Moses several times not to make any mistakes. \"And look that thou make them after their pattern, which was shewed thee in the mount\" (Exodus 25:40). \"God\" also told Moses that he would speak to him from the mercy seat. No one, he told Moses, should come close to the Ark of the Covenant, and he gave precis e instructions about the clothing to be worn and the footwear appropriate when transporting it. In spite of all this care there was a slipup (2 Samuel 6:2). David had the Ark of the Covenant 57"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"moved, and Uzzah helped to drive the cart it was in. When passing cattle shook and threatened to overturn the Ark, Uzzah grabbed hold of it. He fell dead on the spot, as if struck by lightning. Undoubtedly the Ark was electrically charged I If we re­ construct it today according to the instructions handed down by Moses, an electric conductor of several hundred volts is produ ced. The border and golden crown would have served to charge the condenser which was formed by the gold plates and a positive and negative conductor. If, in addition, one of the two cherubim on the mercy seat acted as a magnet, the loudspeaker-perhaps even a kind of set for communica­ tion between Moses and the spaceshi p-was perfect. The de­ tails of the construction of the Ark of the Covenant can be read in the Bible in their entirety. Without actually con­ sulting Exodus, I seem to remember that the Ark was often surrounded by flashing sparks and that Moses made use of this \"tran smitter\" whenever he needed help and advice. Moses heard the voice of his Lord, but he never saw him face to face. When he asked him to show himself to him on one occasion, his \"God\" answer ed: \"Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me and live. And the Lord said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock: And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by: And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen\" (Exodus 33:20-23). There are some astonishing similarities in old texts. On the fifth tablet of the Epic of Gilgamesh, which is of Sumerian origin and much older than the Bible, we find virtually the same sentence: \"N 0 mortal comes to the mountain where the gods dwell. He who looks the gods in the face must die.\" 58"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"In other ancient books which hand down stages in the his­ tory of mankind, we find very similar statements. Why did the \"gods \" not want to show themselves face to face? Why did they not let their masks fall? What were they afraid of? Or does the whole account in Exodus come from the Epic of Gilgamesh? Even that is possible. After all, Moses is supposed to have been brought up in the Egyptian royal household. Perhaps he had access to the library or acqu ired knowledge of ancient secrets during those years. Perhaps we ought to query our Old Testament dating, too, because there is a good deal to support the fact that David, who lived much later, fought with a giant with six fingers and six toes in his day (2 Samuel 21:18-22). We must also consider the possibility that all the ancient histories, sagas, and narratives were collected and compiled in one spot and later found their way to different countries in the form of copies and somewhat garbled versions. The finds during recent years near the Dead Sea (the Qumran texts) provide a valuable and astonishing ampli­ fication of the biblical Book of Genesis. Once again several hitherto unknown texts mention heavenly chariots, sons of heaven, wheels, and the smoke which the flying apparitions emitted. In the Moses Apocalypse (Chapter 33) Eve looked up to heaven and saw a chariot of light traveling there; it was drawn by four shining eagles. No terres trial being could have described its magnificence, it says in Moses. Fin­ ally the chariot drove up to Adam, and smoke came out from between the wheels. This story, incidentally, does not tell us much that is new. Nevertheless, chariots of light, wheels, and smoke were spoken of as magnificent appari­ tions as early as and in connection with Adam and Eve. A fantastic event was deciphered in the Lamech scroll. As the scroll is only fragmentarily preserved, sentences and whole paragraphs of the text are missing. However, what remains is curious enough to be worth retelling. 59"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"This tradition says that one fine day Lamech, Noah's fa­ ther, came home and was surprised to find a boy who, judg­ ing by his appearance, was quite out of place in the family. Lamech reproached his wife Bat-Enosh and claimed that the child was not his. Then Bat-Enosh swore by all that was holy that the seed came from him, father Lamech, and not from a soldier or a stranger or one of the \"sons of heaven.\" (In par­ enthesis we may ask: What sort of \"sons of heaven\" was Bat­ Enosh talking about? At all events, this family drama took place before the Flood.) Nevertheless, Lamech did not be­ lieve his wife's protesta tions and, feeling very upset, went to ask his father Methuselah for advice. On his arrival, he related the family story that was so depressing to him. Methuselah listened to it, reflected, and went off himself to consult the wise Enoch. The cuckoo in the family nest was causing so much trouble that the old man accepted the hard­ ships of the long journey. The question of the little boy's origin had to be cleared up. So Methuselah described how a boy had appeared in his son's family who looked much more like. a son of heaven than a man. His eyes, hair, skin, and whole being were unlike those of the rest of the family. Enoch listened to the story and sent old Methuselah on his way with the extremely worryi ng news that a great judg­ ment would come upon the earth and mankind and that all \"flesh\" would be destroyed because it was sordid and dis­ solute. But the strange boy of whom the family was suspici­ ous had been chosen as the progenitor of those who should survive the great universal judgment. Therefore he should order his son Lamech to call the child Noah. Methuselah journeyed home and told his son Lamech what was in store for them all. What could Lamech do but recognize the un­ usual child as his own and give him the name of Noah l The astonishing thing about this family story is the infor­ mation that Noah's ·parents were told about the coming Flood and that even grandfather Methuse lah was forewarned 60"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"of the terrible event by t,he same Enoch who soon afterward, according to tradition, disappeared forever in a fiery heavenly chariot. Does not this seriously pose the question whether the hu­ man race is not an act of deliberate \"breeding\" by unknown beings from outer space? Otherwise what can be the sense of the constantly recurring fertilization of human beings by giants and sons of heaven, with the consequent extermina­ tion of unsuccessful specimens? Seen in this light, the Flood becomes a preconceived project by unknown beings with the intention of exterminating the human race except for a few noble exceptions. But if the Flood, the course of which is historical ly proved, was quite deliberately planned and pre� pared-and that several hundred years before Noah received orders to build the ark-th en it can no longer be accepted as a divine judgment. Today the possibility of breeding an intelligent human race is no longer such an absurd theory. Just as the sagas of Tiahuanaco and the inscription on the pediment of the Gate of the Sun talk about a spaceship which landed the Great Mother on earth so that she could bear children, the old religious scripts, too, never tire of saying that \"God\" created men in his own image. There are texts which note that it needed several experiments before man finally turned out as successful ly as \"God\" wanted. With the theory of a visit to our earth by unknown intelligences from the cosmos, we could postulate that today we are similarly constituted to those fabulous unidentified beings. In this chain of evidence, the offerings for which the \"gods \" asked our ancestors raise curious problems. Their demands were by no means limited to incense and animal sacrifices. The lists of gifts required by the gods often in­ clude coins made of alloys which are specified in great detail.

It was a heroic epic of great expressive power engraved on twel v e clay tablets, and it belonged to the library of the Ass yrian King Ashurban ipal. The epic was written in Akkadian; later a second copy was found that goes back to King Hammurabi. It is an established fact that the original version of the Epic of Gilgamesh stems from the Sumerians, that mys terious people whose origin we do not know but who left behind the astonishing fifteen-digit number and a very advanced as­ tronomy.

We learn that Gilg amesh was a mixture of \"god\" and man -two-thirds \"go d,\" one-third man.

His whole body was covered with hair; he wore skins, ate grass in the fields, and drank at the same wa­ tering place as the cattle. He also disported himself in the tumbling waters. When Gilgamesh, the king of the town of Druk, heard about this unattractive creature, he suggested that he should be given a lovely woman so that he would become estranged from the cattle. Enkidu, innocent fellow, was taken in by the king's trick and spent six days and six nights with a semi­ divine beauty. This little bit of royal pandering leads us to think that the idea of cross-breeding between a demigod and a half-animal was not taken quite as a matter of course in this barbaric world. The third tablet goes on to tell us about a cloud of dust which came from the distance. The heavens roared, the earth quaked, and finally the \"sun god\" came and seized Enkidu with mighty wings and claws. We read in astonishment that he lay like lead on Enkidu's body and that the weight of his body seemed to him like the weight of a boulder. Even if we gran t the old storytellers a fertile imagi nation and discount the additions made by translators and copyists, the incredible thing about the account still remains: How on earth could the old chronicle rs have known that the weight of the body becomes as heavy as lead at a certain ac­ celeration?

When the gods created man, they al­ lotted him to death, but life they retained in their own keep­ ing.\" Gilgamesh would not be warned; he wanted to reach Utnapishtim, the father of men, no matter what the dangers. But Utnapishtim lived on the far side of the great sea; no road led to him and no ship flew across it except the sun god's. Braving all kinds of perils Gilgamesh crossed the sea. Then follows his encounter with Utnapishtim, which is de­ scribed in the eleventh tablet. Gilgamesh found the figure of the father of men neither bigger nor broader than his own, and he said that they re­ sembled each other like father and son. Then Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh about his past, strangely enough in the first person. To our amazement we are given a detailed description of 66"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"the Flood. He recounts that the \"gods\" warned him of the great flood to come and gave him the task of building a boat on which he was to shelter women and children, his relatives, and craftsmen of every kind. The description of the violent storm, the darkness, the rising flood, and the despair of the · people he could not take with him has tremendous narrative power even today. We also hear- j ust ' as in Noah's account in 'the Bible-the story of the raven and the dove that were re­ leased .and how finally, as the waters went down, the boat grounded on a mountain. The paral lel between the stories of the Flood in the Epic of Gilgamesh and the Bible is beyond doubt, and there is not a single scholar who contests it. The fasc inating thing about this parallelism is that we are dealing with different omens and different \"gods\" in this case. If the accou nt of the Flood in the Bible is a secondhand one, the first-person form of Utnapishtim's narrative shows that a survivor, an eyewitness, was speaking in the Epic of Gilgamesh. It has been clearly proved that a catastrophic flood did take place in the ancient East some thousa nds of years ago. Ancient Babylonian cuneiform texts indicate very precisely where the remains of the boat ought to be. And on the south side of Mount Ararat investigators did in fact find three pieces of wood which possibly indicate the place where the ark gro unded. Incidentally, the chances of finding the re­ mains of a ship that was mainly built of wood and survived a flood more than 6,000 years ago are extremely remote. Besides being a first-hand report, the Epic of Gilg amesh also contains descriptions of extraordinary things that could not have been made up by any intelligence living at the time the tablets were written, any more than they could have been devised by the translators and copyists who manhandled the epic over the centuries. For there are facts buried among 67"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"the descriptions that must have been known to the author of the Epic of Gilgamesh-and we may discover them if we look in the light of present-day knowledge . Perhaps asking some new questions may throw a little light on the darkness. Is it possible that the Epic of Gilgamesh did not originate in the ancient East at all. but in the Tiahua naco region? Is it conceivable that descendants of Gilgamesh came from South America and brought the Epic with them? An affirmative answer would at least explain the mention of the Gate of the Sun. the crossing of the sea. and at the same time the sudden appearance of the Sumerians. for as is well known, all the creations of Babylon. which came later. go back to the Sumerians. Undoubtedly the advanced Egyptian culture of the Pharaohs possessed libraries in which the old secrets were preserved, taught. learned. and written down. As has already been mentioned. Moses grew up at the Egyptian court and certainly had access to the vener­ able library rooms. Moses was a receptive and learned man; indeed he is supposed to have written five of his books him­ self, although it is still an unsolved puzzle in what language he could have written them. If we work on the hypothesis that the Epic of Gilgamesh came to Egypt from the Sumerians by way of the Assyrians and Babylonians. and that the young Moses found it there and adapted it for his own ends. then the Sumerian story of the Flood. and not the biblical one. would be the genuine account. Ought we not to ask such questions? The classical method of research into antiquity has got bogged down and so can­ not come to the right unassailable kind of conclusions . It is �ar too attached to its stereotyped pattern of thought and leaves no scope for the imaginative ideas and speculations which alone could produce a creative impulse. Many opportunitie s for research into the ancient East un­ doubtedly foundered on the inviolability and sacredness of 68"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"the Bible. People did not dare to ask questions and voice their doubts aloud in the face of this taboo. Even the schol­ an of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, ostensibly so enlightened, were still caught in the mental fetters of thou­ sand-year-old errors. because the way back would inevitably have called in question parts of the biblical story. But even very religious Christians must have realized that many of the events described in the Old Testament cannot really be reconc iled with the character of a good, great, and omni­ present God. The very man who wants to preserve the reli­ gious dogmas of the Bible intact ought to be interested in clarifying who actually educated men in antiquity, who gave them the first rules for a communal life, who handed down the first laws of hygiene, and who annihilated the degen­ erate stock. If we think in this way and ask questions like this, it need not mean that we are irreligious. I myself am quite convinced that when the last question about our past has been given a genuine and convincing answer SOMETHING, which I call GOD for want of a better name, will remain for eternity. Yet the hypothesis that the unimaginable god needed ve­ hicles with wheels and wings to move from place to place, mated with primitive people, and dared not let his mask fall remains an outrageous piece of presumption, as long as it is unsupported by proof. The theologians' answer that God is wise and that we cannot imagine in what way he shows himself and makes his people humble is really dodging our question and is unsatisfactory for that reason. People would like to close their eyes to new realities, too. But the future gnaws away at our past day after day. In the near future, the first men will land on Mars. If there is a single, ancient. long­ abandoned edifice there, if there is a single object indicating earlier intelligences, if there is one still recogn izable rock drawing to be found, then these finds will shake the founda­ tions of our religions and throw OUT past into confusion. One 69"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"single discovery of this kind will cause the greatest revolu­ tion and reformation in the history of mankind. In view of the inevitable confrontation with the future, would it not be more intelligent to use new imaginative ideas when conjuring up our past? Without being unbe­ lieving, we can no longer afford to be credulous. Every reli­ gion has an outline, a schema, of its god; it is constrained to think and believe within the framework of this outline. Mean­ while, with the space age, the intell ectual Day of Judgment comes ever nearer. The theological clouds will evaporate, scattered like shreds of mist. With the decisive step into the universe we shall have to recogn ize that there are not 2,000,000 gods, not 20,000 sects, not 10 great religions, but only one. But let us continue to build onto our hypothesis of the Utopian past of humanity. This is the picture so far: Dim, as yet undefinable ages ago an unknown spaceship discovered our planet. The crew of the spaceship soon found out that the earth had all the prerequisites for intell igent life to develop. Obviously the \"man\" of those times was no homo sap iens but something rather differe nt. The spacemen artificially fertilized some female members of this species, put them into a deep sleep, so ancient legends say, and de­ parted. Thousands of years later the space travelers returned and found scattered specimens of the genus homo sapiens. They repeated their breeding experiment several times un­ til finally they produced a creature intelligent enough to have the rules of society imparted to it. The people of that age were still barbaric. Because there was a danger that they might retrogress and mate with animals again, the space trav­ elers destroyed the unsuccessful specimens or took them with them to settle them on other continents. The first comm uni­ ties and the first skills came into being; rock faces and cave walls were painted, pottery was discovered, and the first at­ tempts at architecture were made. 70"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"These first men had tremendous respect for the space trav­ elers. Because they came from somewhere absolutely un­ known and then returned there again, they were the \"gods\" to them. For some mysterious reason the \"gods \" were interested in passing on their intelligence. They took care of the creatures they bred; they wanted to protect them from corruption and preserve them from evil. They wanted to ensure that their community developed constructively. They wiped out the freaks and saw to it that the remainder received the basic requirements for a society capable of developm ent. Admittedly this speculation is still full of holes. I shall be told that proofs are lacking. The future will show how many of those holes can be filled in. This book puts forward a hypothesis made up of many speculations, therefore the hy­ pothesis must not be \"true.\" Yet when I compare it with the theories enabling many religions to live unassailed in the shelter of their taboos, I should like to attribute a minimal percentage of probab ility to my hypothesis. Perhaps it will do some good to say a few words about the \"truth .\" Anyone who believes in a religion and has never been under attack is convinced that he has the \"truth.\" That applie s not only to Christians but also to the membe rs of other religious communities, both large and small. Theo­ sophists, theologists, and philosophers have reflected about their teaching, about their master and his teaching; they are convinced that they have found the \"truth .\" Na turally every religion has its history, its promises made by God, its cove­ nants with God, its prophets and wise teache rs who have said. . . . Proofs of the \"truth\" always start from the center of one's own religion and work outward. The result is a biased way of thinking which we are brought up to accept from childhood. Neverthel ess generations lived and still do live in the conviction that they possess the \"truth .\" Somewhat more modestly, I claim that we cannot possess 71"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"the \"tru th.\" At best we can believe in it. Anyone who really seeks the truth cannot and ought not to seek it under the aegis and within the confines of his own religion. If he does so, is not insincerity godfather to a matter which demands the greatest integrity? What is the purpose and goal of life after all? To believe in the \"truth\" or to seek it? Even if Old Testament facts can be proved archaeolog­ ically in Mesopotamia, those verified facts are still no proof of the religion concerned. If ancient cities, villa ges, wells, and inscriptions are dug up in a particular area, the finds show that the history of the people who lived there is an ac­ tual fact. But they do not prove that the god of that people was the one and only god (and not a space traveler) . Today excav ations all over the world show that traditions tally with the facts. But would it occur to a single Christian to recognize the god of the pre-Inca culture as the genuine god as the results of excavations in Peru? Quite simply what I mean is · that everything, both myth and actual expe­ rience, makes up the history of a people. No more. But even that, I claim, is quite a lot. So anyone who really seeks truth cannot ignore new and bold and as yet unproved points of view simply because they do not fit into his scheme of thought (or belief). Since the question of space travel did not arise a hundred years ago, our fathers and grandfathers could not reasonably have had thoughts about whether our ancestors had visits from the uni­ verse. Let us just venture the frightful. but unfortunately possible, idea that our present-day civilizatio n was entirely destroyed in an H-bomb war. Five thousand years later ar­ chaeologists would find fragments of the Statue of Liberty in New York. According to our current way of thinking they would be bourid to assert that they were dealing with an un­ known divinity, probably a fire god (because of the torch) or a sun god (because of the rays around the statue's head) . 72"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"They would never dare to say that it was a perfectly simple artifact, namely a statue of libe rty. It is no longer possible to block the roads to the past with dogmas. If we want to set out on the arduous search for the truth, we must all summon up the courage to leave the lines along which we have thought until now and as the first step begin to doubt everyth ing that we previously accepted as correct and true. Can we still afford to close our eyes and stop up our ears because new ideas are supposed to be heretical and absurd? After all, the idea of a landing on the moon was absurd fifty years ago. 73"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"6 Ancient Ima 8 ination and Le 8 ends, or Ancient Facts? A s I have previously observe d . there were things in an­ tiquity that should not have existed according to cur­ rent ideas. But my collector's zeal is by no means exhausted with the finds already accum ulated. Why? Because the mythology of the Eskimos also says that the first tribes were brough t to the North by \"gods\" with brazen wingsl The oldest American Indian sagas men­ tion a thunderbird who introduced fire and fruit to them. The Mayan legend. the Popol Vuh. tells us that the \"gods\" were able to recog nize everything: the universe, the four cardinal points of the compass. and even the round shape of the earth. What are the Eskimos doing talking about metal birds? Why do the Indians mention a thunderbird? How are the ancestors of the Mayas supposed to have known that the earth is round? The Mayas were intelligent; they had a highly developed culture. They left behind not only a fabulous calendar but also incredible calculations. They knew the Venusian year of 584 days and estimated the duration of the terrestrial year 75"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"at 365.2420 days. (The exact calculation today : 365.24 221) The Mayas left . behind them calculations to last for 64,000,000 years . Later inscriptions dealt in unit s which prob­ ably approach 400,000,000 years. The fam ous Venusian for­ mula could quite plausibly have been calculated by an elec­ tronic brain. At any rate, it is difficult to believe that it origin­ ated from a jungle people. The Venusian formula of the Mayas runs as follows : The Tzolkin has 260 days, the terres trial year 365 days, and the Venusian year 584 days. These figures conceal the pos­ sibility of an astonishing division sum. 365 is divisible by 73 five times, and 584 eight times. So the incredible formula takes this form: ( Moon) (Sun) (Venus) 20 X 13 = 260 X 2 X 73 = 37,960 8 X 13 = 104 X 5 X 73 = 37,960 5 X 13 = 65 X 8 X 73 == 37,960 In other words , all the cycles coincide after 37,960 days . M a yan m yt h ology claimed that then the \"gods\" would come to the great resting place. The religious legends of the pre-Inca peoples say that the stars were inhabited and that the \"gods\" came down to them from the constellation of the Pleia des. Sumerian, As­ syrian, Babylonian, and Egyp tian cuneif orm inscriptions con­ stantly present the same picture: \"gods \" came from the stars and went back to them; they trav eled through the heavens in fireships or boats, possessed terrifying weapons, and promised immortality to individual men. It was, of course, perfectly natural for the ancient peoples to seek their gods in the sky and also to give their imagina­ tion £Ull rein when describing the magnificence of these in­ comprehensible appa rit ions. Yet even if all that is accepted. there are still t oo many anomalies left. For example. how did the chronicler of the Mahabharata 76"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"know that a weapon capable of punishing a country with a twelve years' drought could exist? And powerful enough to kill the unborn in their mothe rs' wombs? This ancient Indian epic, the Mahabharata, is more comprehensive than the Bible, and even at a conservative estimate its original core is at least 5,000 years old. It is well worth reading this epic in the light of present-day knowledge. We shall not be very surprised when we learn in the Ra­ mayan a that Vimanas, i.e., flying machines, navigated at great heights with the aid of quicksilver and a great propul­ sive wind. The Vimanas could cover vast distances and could travel forward, upward and downward. Enviably mane uver­ able space vehicles! This quotation comes from the translation by N. Dut t, 1891: \"At Rama's behest the mag nificent chariot rose up to a mountain of cloud with a tremendous din .... \" We cannot help noticing that not only is a flying object mentioned again but also that the chronicler talks of a tremendous din. Here is another passage from the Mahabharata: \"Bhima flew with his Vimana on an enormous ray which was as bril­ liant as the sun and made a noise like the thunder of a storm\" (C. Roy, 1889). Even imagination needs something to start it off. How can the chronicler give descriptions that presuppose at least some idea of rockets and the knowledge that such a ve­ hicle can ride on a ray and cause a terrifying thund er? In the Samsaptakabadha a distinction is made between chariots that fly and those that cannot fly. The first book of the Mahabharata reveals the intimate history of the unmar­ ried Kunti, who not only received a visit from the sun god but also had a son by him, a son who is supposed to have been as radiant as the sun itself. As Kunti was afraid-even in those days-of falling into disgrace, she laid the child in a little basket and put it in a river. Adhirata, a worthy man of the 77"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Suta caste, fished basket and child out of the water, and brought up the infant. Really a story that is hardly worth mentioning if it were not so remarkably like the story of Mosesl And, of course, there is yet another refere nce to the fertilization of humans by gods . Like Gilgamesh, Aryu na, the hero of the Mahab­ harata, undertakes a long journey in order to seek the gods and ask them for weapons. And when Aryu na has found the gods after many perils, Indra, the lord of heaven, with his wife, Sachi, beside him, grants him a very exclusive audi­ ence. The two do not meet the valiant Aryuna just anywhere. They meet him in a heavenly war chariot and even invite him to travel in the sky with them. Certain numerical data in the Mahabharata are so precise that one gets the impression that the author was writing from first-hand knowledge. Full of repulsion, he describes a weapon that could kill all warriors who wore metal on their bodies. If the warriors learned about the effect of this weapon in time, they tore off all the metal equipment they were wearing, jum ped into a river, and washed themselves and ever ything that they had come into contact with very thor­ oughly. Not without reason, as the author explains, for the weapon made the hair and nails fall out. Everything living, he bemoaned, became pale and weak. In the eighth book we meet Indra in his heavenly jet chariot again. Out of the whole of mankind he has chosen Yudhisthira as the only one who may enter heaven in his mortal fram e. Here, too, the parallel with the stories of Enoch and Elijah cannot be overlooked. In the same book, in what is perhaps the first account of the dropping of an H-bomb, it says that Gurkha loosed a single proj ectile on the triple city from a mighty Vimana. The narrative uses words which linger in our memories from eyewitness accounts of the detonation of the first hydrogen bomb at Bikini: whi te-hot smoke, a thousand times brighter than the sun, rose up in infinite brilliance and reduced the 78"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"city to ashes. When Gurkha landed again, his vehicle was like a flashing block of antimony. And for the benefit of the philosophers I should mention that the Mahabharata says that time is the seed of the univer se. The Tibet an books Tantyua and Kantyua also mention prehistoric flying machines, which they call \"pearls in the sky.\" Both books expressly emphasize that this knowledge is secret and not for the masses. In the Samarangana Sutrad­ hara whole chapters are devoted to describing airships whose tails spout fire and quic ksilver. The word \"fire\" in ancient texts cannot mean burning fire, fo r altogether some forty different kinds of \"fire,\" mainly connected with esoteric and magnetic phenomena, are enu­ merated. It is hard to believe that the ancient peoples should have known that it is possible to gain energy from heavy metals and how to do so. However, we should not ov­ ersimplif y and dismiss the old Sanscrit texts as mere myths. The large number of passages from old texts already quoted turns the suspicion that men encountered flying \"gods\" in antiquity almost into a certainty. We are not going to get any further with the old approach which scholars unfortu­ nately still cling to: \"That doesn 't exist . . . those are mistakes in translation . . . those are fanciful exaggera tions by the author or copyists .\" We must use a new working hy­ pothesis, one developed from the technological knowledge of our age, to throw light onto the thicket behind which our past lies conceal ed. Just as the phenomenon of the spaceship in the remote past is explicable, there is also a plausible ex­ planation of the terrible weapons which the gods made use of at least once in those days and which are so frequently de­ scribed. A passage from the Mahabha rata is bound to make us think: It was as if the elements had been unleashed. The sun spun round. Scorched b y the incandescent heat of the weapon, the world reeled in fever. Elephants were set on fire by the heat 79"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"and ran to and fro in a frenzy to seek protection from the terrible violence. The water boiled, the animals died, the enemy was mown down and the raging of the blaze made the trees collapse in rows as in a forest fire. The elephants made a fearful trumpeting and sank dead to the gro und over a vast are a. Horses and war chari ots were burnt up and the scene looked like the afterm ath of a conflagra tion. Thousands of chariots were destroyed, then deep silence descended on the sea. The winds began to blow and the earth grew brigh t. It was a terrible sight to see. The corpses of the fallen were mutilated by the terrible heat so that they no longer looked like human beings. Never before have we seen such a ghastly weapon and never before have we heard of such a weapon (C. Roy, 1889). The story goes on to say that those who escaped washed themselves, their equipment, and their arms, because ev­ erything was polluted by the death-dealing breath of the \"god s.\" What does it say in the Epic of Gilgamesh? \"Has the poisonous breath of the heavenly beast smitten you?\" Alberto Tulli, formerly keeper of the Egyptian Depart­ ment in the Vatican Museum, found a fragm ent of a text from the time of Thutmose III, who lived about 1500 B.C. It relates the tradition that the scribes saw a ball of fire come down from heaven and that its breath had an evil smell. Thu tmose and his soldiers watched this spectacle until the ball of fire rose in a southe rly direction and dis­ appeared from view. All the texts quoted date from millennia before our era. The aut hors lived on different continents and belonged to diff erent cultures and religions. There were no special messengers to spread the news in those days, and inter­ continental journeys were not an everyday occurrence. In spite of this, traditions telling almost the same story corne from the four corners of the world and from innumerable sources. Did all their authors have the same bee in their bon- 80"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"net? Were they all haunted by the same phenomenon? It is impossible and incredi ble that the chroniclers of the Mahabharata, the Bible, the Epic of Gilgamesh, the texts of the Eskimos, the American Indians, the Scandinavians , the Tibetans, and many, many other sources should all tell the same sto rl es-of flying \"gods,\" strange heavenly vehicles, and the frightfu l catastrophes connected with these apparitions -by chance and without any foundatio�. They cannot all have had the same ideas all over the world. The almost uni­ form texts can stem only from facts, i.e., from prehistoric events. They related what was actually there to see. Even if the reporter in the remote past may have exaggerated his story with fanciful trimmings, much as newsmen do to­ day, the fact, the actual incident, still remains at the core of all exclusive accounts, as it does today. And that incident obviously cannot have been invented in so many places in different ages. Let us make up an example: A helicopter lands in the African bush for the first time. None of the natives has ever seen such a machine. The heli­ copter lands in a clearing with a sinister clatter; pilots in battle dress, with crash helmets and machine guns, jump out of it. The savage in his loincloth stands stupefied and uncom­ prehend ing in the presence of this thing that has come down from heaven and the unknown \"gods\" who came . with it. After a time the helicopter takes off again and disap­ pears into the sky. Once he is alone again, the savage has to work out and interpret this apparition. He will tell others who were not presen t what he saw: a bird, a heavenly vehicle, that made a terrible noise and stank, and white-skinned creatures carrying weapons that spat fire. The miraculous visit is fixed and handed down for all time. When the father tells it to his son, the heavenly bird obviously does not get any smaller, and the creatures that got out of it become weirder, 81"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"stronger, and more imposing. These and many other em­ bellishments will be add e d to the story. But the premise for the glorious legend was the actual landing of the helicopter. It did land in the clearing in the jungle and the pilots did climb out of it. From that moment the event is perpetuated in the mythology of the tribe. Certain things cannot be made up. I should not be ran­ sacking our prehistory for space travelers and heavenly air­ craft if accounts of such apparitions appeared in only two or three ancient books. But when in fact nearly all the texts of the primitive peoples all over the globe tell the same story, I feel I must try to explain the objective thrust con­ cealed in their pages. \"Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a ,rebellious house, which have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear not ... \" (Ezekiel 12:2). We know that all the Sumerian gods had their counter­ parts in certain stars. There is supp osed to have been a statue to Marduk (Mars), the highest of the gods, that weighed 800 talents of pure gold. If we are to believe He­ rodotus, that is equivalent to more than 48,000 pounds of gold. Ninurta (Sirius) was judge of the universe and passed sentence on mortal men. There are cuneif orm tablets which were addressed to Mars, to Sirius, and to the Pleiades. Time and again Sumerian hymns and prayers mention divine weapons, the form and effect of which must have been com­ pletely senseless to the people of those days . A panegyric to Mars says that he made fire rain down and destroyed his enemies with a brilliant lightning flash. Inanna is described as she traverses the heavens, radiating a frightfu l blinding gleam and annihilating the houses of the enemy. Drawings and even the model of a home have been found resembling a prefabricated atomic bunker: round and massive, with a single strangely framed aperture. From the same period, about 3000 B.C., archaeologists have found a model of 82"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"a team with chariot and driver, as well as two sportsmen wrestling, all of immaculate craftsmansh ip. The Sumerians, it has been proved, were masters of applied art. Then why did they model a clumsy bunker, when other excavations at Babylon or Uruk have brought much subtler works to light? Quite recently a whole Sumerian library of about 60,000 clay tablets was found in the town of Nippur, 95 miles south of Baghdad. We now possess the oldest accou nt of the Flood, engraved on a tablet in six colums. Five antediluvian cities are named on the tablets: Eridu, Badtibira, Larak, Sitpar, and Shuruppak. Two of these cities have not yet been discovered. On these tablets, the oldest deciphered to date, the Noah of the Sumerians is called Ziusudra. He is supposed to have lived in Shuruppak and also to have built his ark there. So we now possess an even older description of the Flood than the one in the Epic of Gilgame sh. No one knows whether new finds will not produce still earlier accounts. The men of the ancient cultures seem to have been almost obsessed with the idea of immortality or rebirth. Servants and slaves obviously lay down voluntarily in the tomb with their masters . In the burial chamber of Shub-At, no less than seventy skeletons lay next to each ot h er in perfect order. Without the least sign of violence; sitting or lying in their brilliantly colored robes, they awaited the death which must have come swiftly and painlessly-perhaps by poison. With unshakable conviction, they looked forward to a new life be­ yond the grave with their masters . But who put the idea of rebirth into the heads of these heathen peoples? The Egypt ian pantheon is just as confusing. The ancient texts of the people on the Nile also tell of mighty beings who travers ed the finnament in boats. A cuneiform text to the sun god Ra runs: \"Thou couplest under the stars and the moon, thou drawest the ship of Aten in heaven and on earth like the tirelessly revolving stars and the stars at the North Pole that do not set.\" 83"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Here is an inscription from a pyr amid: \"Thou art he who directs the sun ship of millio ns of years.\" Even if the old Egyp tian mathematicians were very ad­ vanced, it is odd that they should speak of millio ns of years in connection with the stars and a heavenly ship. What does the Mahab harata say? \"Time is the seed of the uni­ verse.\" In Memphis the god Ptah handed the king two models with which to celebrate the anniversaries of his reign and commanded him to celebrate the said anniversaries for six times a hundred thousand years . When the god Ptah came to give the king the models he appeared in a gleaming heav­ enly chariot and afterward disappeared over the horizon in it. Today represe ntations of the winged sun and a soaring ' falcon carrying the sign of eternity and eternal life can still be found on doors and temples at Idfu. There is no known . place in the world where such innumerable illust rations of winged symbols of the gods are preserved as in Egypt . Every tourist knows the Island of Elephantine with the famous N ilometer at Aswan. The island is called Ele­ phantine even in the oldest texts. because it was supposed to resemble an elephant. The texts were quite right-the island does look like an elephant. But how did the ancient Egyptians know that? This shape can be recognized only from an airplane at a great height. for there is no hill offering a view of the island that would prompt anyone to make the comparison. A recently discovered inscription on a building at Idfu says that the edifice is of supernatural origin. The ground plan was drawn by the deified being lm-Hotep. Now this 1m-Hotep was a very mysterious and clever per­ sonality-the Einstein of his time. He was priest. scribe. doctor. architect. and philosopher rolled into one. In this ancient world, the age of Im-Hotep, according to archaeolo- 84"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"gists, the only tools the people could have used for working stone were wooden wedges and copper, neither of which is suit able for cutting up granite blocks. Yet the brilliant Im­ Hotep built the step pyram id of Sakkara for his king, who was called Zoser. This 197-fo ot-high edifice is built with a mastery that Egyptian architects were never quite able to equal afterward. The structure, surrounded by a wall 33 feet high and 1,750 feet long, was called the House of Eternity by Im-Hotep. He had himself buried in it, so that the gods could wake him on their return. We know that all the pyramids were laid out according to the positions of certain stars. Is not this knowledge a bit embarrassing in view of the fact that we have very little evi­ dence of Egyptian astronomy? Sirius was one of the few stars they took an interest in. But this very interest in Sirius seems rather peculia r, because seen from Memphis, Sirius can be observed only in the early dawn just above the horizon when the Nile Hoods begin. To fill the measure of confusion to overflowing, there was an accurate calendar in Egypt 4, 221 years before our eral This calendar was based on the rise of Sirius (1st Tout = July 19) and gave annual cycles of more than 32 ,000 years. Admittedly the old astronomers had plenty of time to ob­ serve the sun, the moon, and the stars, year in, year out, un­ til they finally decided that all the stars stand in the same place agai n after approximately 365 days . But surely it was quite absurd to base the first calendar on Sirius when it would have been easier to use the sun and the moon, besides leading to more accurate results. Presumably the Sirius calendar is a built-up system, a theory of probabilities, because it could never pred ict the appearance of the star. If Sirius ap­ peared on the horizon at dawn at the same time as the Nile flood, it was pure coincidence. A Nile flood did not hap. pen every year, nor did every Nile flood take place on the 85"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"same day. In which case, why a Sirius calendar? Is there an old tradition here, too? Was there a text or a promise which was carefully guarded by the priesthood? The tomb in which a gold necklace and the skeleton of an entirely unknown animal were found probably belonged to King Udimu. Where did the animal come from? How can we explain the fact that the Egyp tians had a decimal system already at the beginning of the first dynasty? How did such a highly developed civilization arise at such an early date? Where do objects of copper and bronze originate as early as the beginning of the Egyptian culture? Who gave them their incredible knowledge of mathematics and a ready-made writing? Bef ore we deal with some monumental buildings which raise innum erable questions, let us take another brief glance at the old texts. Where did the narrators of The Thou sand and One Nights get their staggering wealth of ideas? How did anyone come to describe a lamp from which a magician spoke when the owner wished? What daring imagination invented the \"Op en, Sesam e!\" incident in the tale of Ali Baba and the forty thieves? Of course, such ideas no longer astonish us today, for the television set shows us talking pictures at the tum of a switch. And as the doors of most large department stores open by photocells, even the \"Op en, Sesame !\" incident no longer conceals any special mystery. Nevertheless the imagin­ ative power of the old storytellers was so incredible that the books of contempo rary writers of science fiction seem banal in comparison. So it must be that the ancient storytellers had a store of things already seen, known, and experienced ready at hand to spark off their imagination! In the legendary and sagalike world of intangible cultures which as yet offer to us no fixed points of reference, we are on still shakier ground, and things become even more confusing. 86"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Nat urally the Icelandic and Old Norwegian traditions also mention \"gods\" wao travel in the sky. The goddess Frigg has a maidservant called Gna. The goddess sends her hand­ maid to different worlds on a steed which rises in the air above land and sea. The steed is called \"Hoof-thrower,\" and once, says the saga, Gna met some strange creatures high in the air. In the Al wislied different names are given to the earth, the sun, the moon, and the uni verse depending on whether they are seen from the point of view of men, \"gods, \" giants, or dwarfs. How on earth could people in the dim past arrive at different perceptions of one and the same thing, when the horizon was very limited? Although the scholar Snorri Sturluson did not write down the Nordic and Old Germanic legends, sagas, and songs until about A.D. 1200, they are known to be some thousands of years old. In these writings the symbol of the world is often descri bed as a disc or a ball-remarkably enoug h-an d Thor, the leader of the gods, is always shown with a hammer, the destroyer. Herbert Kuhn suppo rts the view that the word \"hammer\" means \"stone,\" dates from the Stone Age, and was transferred to bron . ze and iron hammers only later. Con­ sequently Thor and his hammer symbol must have been very ancient and probably do go back to the Stone Age. More­ over, the word \"Thor\" in the Indian (Sanscrit) legends is \"Tana yitnu\"; this could be more or less rendered as \"the Thunderer.\" The Nordic Thor, god of gods , is the lord of the Germanic Wan nen, who makes the skies unsafe. When arguing about the entirely new aspects that I in­ troduce into investigation of the past, the objection might be made that it is not possible to compile everything in the an­ cient traditions that points to heavenly apparitions into a sequence of proofs of prehistoric space trav el.

It is unworthy of a scientific investigator to deny something when it upsets his working hypothesis and accept it when it supports his theory. Im­ agine the shape my theory would take and the strength it would gain if new translations made with a \"space outlook\" existed ! . To help us patiently forge the chain of our thesis a little further, scrolls wit h fragments of apocalyptic and liturgi­ cal texts were recently found near the Dead Sea. Once again, in the Apocryphical Books of Abraham and Moses, we hear about a heavenly chariot with wheels, which spit s fire, whereas similar references are lacking in the Ethiopian and Slavic Book of Enoch. \"Behind the being I saw a chariot whic h had wheels of fire, and every wheel was full of eyes all around, and on the wheels was a throne and this was covered with fire that flowed around it\" (Apocryphal Book of Abraham 18: 11-12 ). Acco rding to Gershom Scholem's explanation, the throne and chariot symbolism of the Jewish mystics corr esponded roughly to that of the Hellenistic and early Christian mystics when they talk about pleroma (abundance of light). That is a respectable explanation, but can it be accepted as scien­ tifically proved? May we simply ask what would be the case if some people had really seen the fiery chariot that is de­ scribed 'over and over again? A secret script was used very frequently in the Qumran scrolls; among the documents in the fourth cave different kinds of characters alternate in one and the same astrological work. An astronomical observation 88"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"bears the title: \"Words of the judicious one which he has ad­ dressed to all sons of the dawn.\" But what is the crushing and convincing objection to the possibility that real fiery chariots were described in the an· cient texts? Surely not the vague and stupid assertion that fiery chariots cannot have existed in antiquity! Such an an­ swer would be unworthy of the men I am trying to force to face new alternatives with my questions. Lastly, it is by no means so long ago that reputable scholars said that no stones (meteors) could fall from the sky, because there were no stones in the sky. Even nineteenth-centu ry mathematicians came to the conclusion--convincing in their day-t hat a railway train would not be able to trave l faster than 21 miles an hour because if it did the air would be forced out of it and the paSsengers would suffocate. Less than a hund red years ago it was \"proved\" that an object heavier than air would never be able to Hy. A review in a reputable newspaper classed Walter Sulli­ van's book We Are Not Al one as science fiction and said that even in the most distant future it would 'be quite impossible to reach, say, Epsilon Eridani or Tau Ceti; even the effect of a shift in time or deep-freezing the as­ tronauts could never overcome the barriers of the inconceiv· able distances. It is a good thing that there were always enough bold visionaries oblivious to contemporary criticism in the past. Without them there would be no worldwide railway network today, with trains travel ing at 124 miles an hour and more. (N.B.: Passengers die at more than 21 miles per hou r!) Without them there would be no jet aircraft today, because they would certainly fall to the grou nd. (Things that are heavier than air cannot fly!) And there would be no moon rockets.

In so doing they are too ready and willing to forget that what is reality today may have been the Utopian dream of a visionary yesterday . We owe a considerable number of all the epoch-making discoveries that our age thinks of as realities to lucky chances, not to steady systematic resear ch. And some of them stand to the credit of the \"serious vis­ ionaries\" who overcame restricting prejudice with their bold speculations. For example, Heinrich Schliemann accepted Homer's Od yssey as more than stories and fables and dis­ covered Troy as a result. We still know too little about our past to be able to make a definite judgment about it. New finds may solve unprec­ edented mysteries; the reading of ancient narratives is capable of turning whole worlds of realities upside down. Incidentally, it is obvious to me that more old books were destroyed than are preserved. There is supposed to have been a book in South America that contained all the wisdom of antiquity; it is reputed to have been destroyed by the sixty-third Inca ruler, Pachacuti IV. In the library of Alex­ andria 500,000 volumes belonging to the learned Ptolemy Soter contained all the traditions of mankind; the library was partly destroyed by the Romans, and the rest was burned on the orders of Caliph Omar centuries later.

Thank heavens that to­ day books do not exist in single copies, as in the past. The texts and fragm ents still available transmit a great deal of knowledge from the remote past. In all ages the sages of a nation knew that the future would always bring wars and revolutions, blood and fire. Did this knowledge per­ haps lead these sages to hide secrets and tradi tions from the mob in the colossal build ings of their period or to preserve them from possible destruction in a safe place? Have they \"hidden\" information or accounts in pyramids, temples, and statues, or bequeathed them in the form of ciphers so that they would withstand the ravages of time? We certainly ought to test the idea, for farsighted contemporaries of our own day have acted in this way-for the future. In 1965 Americans buri ' ed in the soil of New York two time capsules so constituted that they could withstand the very worst that this earth could offer in the way of calami­ ties for 5,000 years. These time capsules contained news that we want to transmit to posterity, so that some day those who strive to illuminate the darkness surrounding the past of their forefathers will know how we lived. The cap­ sules are made of a metal that is harder than steel; they can survive even an atomic explosion. In addition to daily news, the capsules contain photographs of cities, ships, auto­ mobiles, aircraft, and rockets; they house samples of metals and plastics, of fabrics, threads, and cloths; they hand down to posterity objects in everyday use such as coins, tools, 91"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"and toilet articles ; books about mathematics, medicine, phys­ ics, biolog y, and astronautics are preserved on microfi lm.

John Harrington invented the ingenious decoding system for ge nerations yet unknown. Lunatics? Visionaries? I find the realization of this proj ect beneficial and reassuring. It's nice to know that there are men today who think 5,000 years ahead I The archaeologists of some remote future age will not find things any easier than we did. For after an atomic conflagra tion none of the world's libraries will be of any use, and all the achievements that make us so proud will not be worth twopence-b ecause they have disappeared, be­ cause they have been destroyed, because they have been at­ omized.

(A figure, in­ cidentally, that flagrantly contradicts the 20,000,000 con­ sidered to be the total population of the world in 3000 B.C. !) With such enormous estimates a couple of million men more or less does not matter. But ,one thing is clear-they all had to be fed. There were not only a host of construction workers, stone masons, engine e rs, and sailors, there were not only hundreds of thousands of slaves, but also a well­ equipped army, a large and pampered priesthood, count­ less merchants, farmers, and officials, and last but not least the Pharaonic household living on the fat of the land. C ould they all have lived on the scanty yields of agriculture in the Nile Delta? I shall be told that the stone blocks used for building the temple were moved on rollers. In other words, wooden rol­ lers! But the Egyptians could scarcely have felled and turned into rollers the few trees, mainly palms, that then (as now) grew in Egypt, because the dates from the palms were ur­ gently needed for food and the trunks and fronds were the only things giving shade to the dried-up ground. But they must have been wooden rollers, otherwise there would not be even the feeblest technical explanation of the building of the pyramids. Did the Egyptians import wood? In order to import wood there must · have been a sizable fleet, and even after it had been landed in Alexandria the wood would have had to be transported up the Nile to Cairo. Since the Egyp­ tians did not have horses and carts at the time of the build­ ing of the Great Pyra mid, there was no other possibility.

What resources did they have in order to lay out a maze of galler­ ies and rooms? The walls are smooth and mostly decorated with paintings in relief. The shafts slope down into the rocky soil; they have steps built in the best tradition of craftsman­ ship that lead to the burial chambers far below. Hordes of tourists stand gaping in amazement at them, but none of them gets an explanation of the mysterious technique used in their excavation. Yet it is firmly established that the Egyptians were masters of the art of tunneling from the earliest times, for the old rock-cut tombs are worked in ex­ actly the same way as the more recent ones. There is no dif· ference between the tomb of Tety from the sixth dynasty and the tomb of Rameses I from the New Kingdom, al­ though there is a minimum of 1,000 years between the build­ ing of the two tombs. Obviously the Egyptians had not learned anything new to add to their old technique. In fact the more recent edifices tend increasingly to be poor copies of their ancient models. The tourist who bumps his way to the pyramid of Cheops to the west of Cairo on a camel called Wellington or Napo­ leon, depending on his nationality, gets the strange sensation in the pit of his stomach that relics of the mysterious past always produce. The guide tells him that a pharaoh had a burial place built here. And with that bit of rehashed erudition he rides homeward, after taking some impressive photographs . The pyramid of Cheops, in particular, has in­ spired hundreds of crazy and untenable theories. In the 600-page book Our Inheritance in the Great Pyr amid, by Charles Piazzi Smith, published in 1864, we can read about many hair.rai sing links between the pyramid and our globe. Yet even after a highly critical examination, it still con­ tains some facts that should stimulate us to reflection. It is well known that the ancient Egyptians practiced a solar religion. Their sun god, Ra, traveled through the heav- 9 7"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"ens in a bark. Pyramid texts of the Old Kingdom even de­ scribe heavenly journeys by the king, obviously made with the help of the gods and their boats. So the gods and kings of the Egyptians were also involved with flying. . . . Is it really a coincidence that the height of the pyram id of Cheops multiplied by a thousand mill ion- 98,OOO,OOO mil � orres ponds approximately to the distance between the earth and sun? Is it a coincidence that a meridian run­ ning through the pyramids divides contine nts and oceans into two exactly equal halves? Is it coincidence that the area of the base of the pyramid divided by twice its height gives the celebrated figure 7r = 3.l4159? Is it coincidence that cal­ culations of the weight of the earth were found and is it also coincidence that the rocky ground on which the struc­ ture stands is carefully and accurately leveled? There is not a single clue to explain why the builder of the pyramid of Cheops, the Pharaoh Khufu, chose that par­ ticular rocky terrain in the desert as the site for his edifice. It is conceivable that there was a natural cleft in the rock which he made use of for the colossal building, while another explanation, though only a feeble one, may be that he wanted to watch the progress of the work from his sum­ mer palace. Both reasons are agains t all common sense. In the first case it would certainly have been more practical to locate the building site nearer the eastern quarries in order to shorten transport distances, and second, it is hard to im­ agine that the pharaoh wanted to be disturbed year after year by the din that filled building sites day and night even in those days. Since there is so much to be said against the textbook explanations of the choice of site, one might reason­ ably ask whether the \"gods\" did not have their say here, too, even if it was by way of the priesthood. But if that explana­ tion is accepted, there is one more important proof of my theory of the Utopian past of mankind. For the pyramid not only divides continents and oceans into two equal halves; it 98"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"also lies at the center of gravity of the continents. If the facts noted here are not coincidences-and it seems extremely dif­ ficult to believe that they are-then the building site was chosen by beings who knew all about the spherical shape of the earth and the distribution of continents and seas. In this connection let us not forget Piri Reis' maps I It cannot all be coincidence or be explained away as fairy stories. With what power, with what \"machines,\" with what tech­ nical resources was the rocky terrain leveled at all? How did the master builders drive the tunnels downward? And how did they illuminate them? Neither here nor in the rock-cut tombs in the Valley of Kings were torches or anything similar used. There are no blackened ceilings or walls or even the slightest evidence that traces of blackening have been re­ moved. How and with what were the stone blocks cut out of the quarries? With sharp edges and smooth sides? How were they transported and joined together to the thousandth of an inch? Once again there is a wealth of explanations for anyone to choose from : inclined planes and tracks along which the stones were pushed, scaffolding and ramps. And naturally the labor of many hundreds of thousands of Egyp­ tian slaves: fellahin, builders, and craftsm en. None of these explanations stands up to a critical exam­ ination. The Great Pyramid is (and remains?) visible testi­ mony of a technique that has never been understood. Today, in the twentieth century, no architect could build a copy of the pyramid of Cheops, even if the technical resources of every continent were at his disposal. 2,600,000 gigan tic blocks were cut out of the quarries, dressed and transpor ted, and fitted together on the build­ ing site to the nearest thousandth of an inch. And deep down inside, in the galleries, the walls were painted in colors . The site of the pyramid was a whim of the pharaoh. The unpara lleled, \"classical\" dimensions of the pyram id occurred to the master builder by chance. 99"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Several hundred thousand workers pushed and pulled blocks weighing twelve tons up a ramp with (nonexistent) ropes on (nonexistent) rollers . This host of workers lived on (nonexistent) grain. They slept in (nonexis tent) huts which the pharaoh had built outside his summer palace. The workers were urged on by an encouraging \"Heave-ho\" over a (nonexistent) loudspeaker, and so the twelve-ton blocks were pushed skyward. If the industrious workers had achieved the extraordinary daily piece rate of ten blocks piled on top of each other, they would have assembled the 2,600,000 stone blocks into the magnificent stone pyramid in about 250,000 days- 664 years. Yes, and don't forget that the whole thing came into being at the whim of an eccentric king who never lived to see the completion of the edifice he had inspired. Of course one must not even suggest that this theory, so seriously advan ced, is ridiculous . Yet who is so ingenuous as to believe that the pyramid was nothing but the tomb of a king? From now on, who will consider the transmission of mathematical and astronomical signs as pure chance? Today the Great Pyramid is undisputedly attributed to the Pharaoh Khufu as inspirer and builder. Why? Because all the inscriptions and tablets refer to Khufu. It seems obvious to me that the pyramid cannot have been erected during a sin­ gle lifetime. But what if Khufu forged the inscriptions and tablets that are supposed to proclaim his fame? That was quite a popular procedure in antiquity, as many buildings bear witness. Whenever a dictatorial ruler wanted the fame for himsel f alone, he gave orders for this process to be car­ ried out. If that was the case, then the pyram id existed long before Khufu left his visiting card. In the Bodleian Library at Oxford there is a manuscript in which the Coptic author Mas-Udi asserts that the Egyp­ tian King Surid had the Great Pyramid built. Oddly enough, 100"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"this Surid ruled in Egypt before the Flood. And this wise King Surid ordered his priests to write down the sum total of their wisdom and conceal the writings inside the pyramid. So, according to the Coptic tradition, the pyramid was built before the Flood. Herodotus confirms such a supposition in Book II of his History. The priests of Thebes had shown him 341 colos­ sal statues, each of which stood for a high-priestly generation over a period of 11,340 years. Now we know that every high priest had his statue made during his own lifetime; and Herodotus also tells us that during his stay in Thebes one priest after another showed him his statue as a proof that the son had always followed the father. The priests assured Herodotus that their statements were very accurate, because they had written everything down for many generations, and they explained that every one of these 341 statues repre­ sented a gene ration. Before these 34 1 generations the gods had lived among men, and since then no god had visited them again in human form. The historical period of Egypt is usually estimated at about 6,500 years. Then why did the priests lie so shame­ lessly to the traveler Herodotus about their 11,340 years? And why did they so expressly emphasize that no gods had dwel t among them for 341 generations? These precise details would have been completely pointless if \"gods\" had not really lived among men in the remote pastl We know next to nothing about the how, why, and when of the building 'of the pyramid.

Various peoples knew the technique of embalming corpses, and archaeological finds favor the supposition that prehistoric beings believed in corporeal return to a second life. That interpretation would be acceptabl e if there was even the remotest evidence of a belief in a corporeal return in the religious philosophy of antiquity! If our primitive ancestors had believed in only a spiritual return, they would scarcely have gone to such trouble with the dead. But finds in Egyptian tombs provide example after exampl e of the pr�paration of embalmed corpses for a corporeal return. What the evidence says, what visible proof says, cannot be so absurd I Drawings and sagas actually indicated that the \"gods\" promised to return from the stars in order to awaken the well-preserved bodies to new life. That is why the provisioning of the embalmed corpses in the burial chambers took such a practical form and was intended for a life on this side of the grave. Otherwise what were they sup­ posed to have done with money, jewelry, and their favor­ ite articles? And as they were even provided in the tomb with some of their servants, who were unquestionably buried alive, the point of all the preparations was obviously the continuation of the old life in a new life. The tombs were tremendously durable and solid, almos t atom-bomb­ proof; they could survive the ravages of all the ages. The valuables left in them, gold and precious stones, were vir­ tually indestruct ible. I am not concerned here with discussing the later abuses of mummification. I am only concerned with the question: Who put the idea of corporeal rebirth into the heads of the heathen? And whence came the first audacious idea that the cells of the body had to be preserved so that the corpse, preserved in a very secure place, could be awakened to new life after thousands of years?

You must read what follows twice to grasp the fantastic implications of the result of the next piece of scientific re­ search. In March. 1963, biologists - of the Univers ity of Oklahoma confirmed that the skin cells of the Egyptian Princess Mene were capable of living. And Princess Mene has been dead for several thousand years ! There have been finds in many places of mummies which are preserved so completely and intact that they seem to be alive. Glacier mummies left by the Incas survived the ages and theoretically they are capable of living. Utopia?

Dr. Ettinger, often scoffed at today, prophesies a remote future in which men will not be consumed by fire or eaten by worms-a future in which bodies, frozen in deep-freeze cemeteries or deep-freeze bunkers, await the day when ad­ vances in medical science can remove the cause of their death and bring their bodies to new life. One can see the terrifying vision of an army of deep-frozen soldiers who will be thawed out as necessary in case of war. A really horrifying idea. But what connection have mummies with our theory of space travelers in the remote past? Am I dragging proofs in willy-nilly? I ask: How did the ancients know that the body cells con­ tinue to live slowed down a billio nfold after special treat­ ment? I ask: Where did the idea of immortality come from, and how did people get the concept of corporeal reawakening in the first place? The majority of ancient peoples knew the technique of mummification, and the rich people actually practiced it. I am not concerned here with this demonstrable fact, but with solving the problem of where the idea of a reawaken­ ing, a return to life, origin ated. Did the idea occur to some king or tribal prince purely by chance or did some prosper­ ous citizen watch \"gods \" treating their corpses with a com­ plicated process and preserving them in bomb-proof sarcophagi ? Or did some \"gods\" (space travelers) trans mit to a quick-witted prince of royal blood their knowledge of how corpses can be reawakened after a special treatment? These speculations require confirmation from contem­ porary sources. In a few hundred years mankind will have a mastery of space travel that is inconceivable today. Travel agencies will offer trips to the planets, with precise de- 104"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"parture and return dates, in their brochures. Obvi ously a prere quisite for this mastery is that all branches of science keep pace with the devel opment of space travel. Electronics and cybernetics alone will not do the trick. Medicine and biology will make their contribution by finding out ways of lengthening the vital functions of human beings. Today this department of space research is also working in top gear. Here we must ask ourselves : Did space travelers in prehistory already possess knowledge that we must gain anew? Did un­ known intelligences already know the methods with which to treat bodies so that they could be revived in so many thou­ sand years? Perhaps the \"gods ,\" being shrewd, had an in­ teres t in \"preserving\" at least one dead man with all the knowledge of his time so that some day he could be ques­ tioned about the history of his genera tion? Who can tell? Is it not possible that such an interrogation by \"gods\" who came back has already taken place? In the course of the centuries, mummification, originally a solemn matter, became the fashion. Suddenly everyone wanted to be reawakene d; , suddenly everyone thought that he would come to new life so long as he did the same as his forefathers . The high priests, who actually did possess some knowledge of such reawak enings, did a great deal to encourage this cult, for their class did good busine ss out of it. I have already mentioned the physical ly impossible ages of the Sumerian kings and the biblical figures. I asked whether these people could not have been space travelers who prolonged their life-span through the effect of the time shift on interstellar flights just below the speed of light. Are we perhaps getting a clue to the incredible age of the men named in the texts if we assume that they were mum­ mified or frozen? If we follow this theory, then the unknown space travelers would have frozen leading personalities in antiquity-put them into an artificial deep sleep, as leg­ ends tell us-and taken them out of the drawer, thawed 105"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"them out, and conversed with them during subsequent visits. At the end of each visit it would have been the task of the priestly class appointed and instructed by the space travelers to prepare the living dead again and preserve them once more in giant temples until the \"gods\" returned. Impossible? Ridiculous? It is mostly those people who feel that they are absolutely bound by the laws of nature who make the most stupid objections. Does not nature her­ self display brilliant examples of \"hibernation\" and re­ awakening? There are species of fish which, after being frozen stiff, thaw out at milder temperatures and swim around again in the water. Flowers, larvae, and grubs not only go into hiber­ nation but also reappear in the spring in lovely new garb. Let me be my own devil's advo cate. Did the Egyptians learn the possibility of mummification from nature? If that were the case, there ought to have been a cult of butter­ flies or cockchafers or at least a trace of such a cult. There is nothing of the kind. Underground tombs do contain gigantic sarcophagi with mummified animals, but given their climate the Egyptians could not have copied hibernation from ani­ mals. Five miles from Helwan lie more than 5,000 tombs of different sizes which all date to the time of the first and sec­ ond dynasties. These tombs show that the art of mummi­ fication is more than 6,000 years old. In 1953 Professor Emery discovered a large tomb in the archaic cemetery of North Sakkara that is attributed to a pharaoh of the first dynasty. Apart from the main tomb there were 72 other tombs, arranged in three rows, in which lay the bodies of the servants who wanted to accom­ pany their king in the new world. No trace of violence is vis­ ible on the bodies of the 64 young men and 8 young women. Why did these 72 allow themselves to �e walled up and killed? Belief in a second life beyond the grave is the best-known 106"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"and also the simplest explanation of this phenomenon. In addition to gold and jewelry the pharaoh was provided in the tomb with grain, oil, and spices which were obviously intended as provisions for the life to come. Apart from grave robbers, the tombs were also opened by later pharaohs. In such cases the pharaoh found the provis ions in the tomb of his ancestor well preserved. In other words the dead man had neither eaten them nor taken them into another world. And when the tomb was closed again, fresh supplies were placed in the vault, which was shut up, protected against thieves, and sealed with many traps. It seems obvious that' the Egyptians believed in a reawakening in the distant fu­ ture, not an immediate reawakening in the hereafter. In June, 1954, also at Sakkara, a tomb was discovered that had not been robbed, for a chest containing jewels and gold lay in the burial chamber. The sarcophagus was closed . with a sliding lid, instead of a removable one. On June 9 Dr. Goneim ceremonially opened the sarcop hagus. It contained nothing. Absolutely nothing. Did the mummy decamp, leaving its jewels behind? The Russian Rodenko discovered a grave, Kurgan V, fifty miles from the frontier of Outer Mongolia. This grave takes the form of a rocky hill that is faced internally with wood. All the burial chambers are packed with eternal ice, and as a result the contents of the grave were preserved in a state of deep-f reeze . One of these chambers contained an em­ balmed man and a similarly treated woman. Both of them were provi ded with every thing that they might have needed for a life to come: foodstuffs in dishes, clothes, jewels, and musical instruments. Every thing was deep-frozen and in an excellent state of prese rvation, including the naked mum­ mies. In one burial chamber scholars identified a rectan­ gle containing four rows of six squares, each of which had a drawing inside it. The whole could be a copy of the stone carpet in the Assyri an palace at Ninevehl Strange sphinxlike figures with complicated horns on their heads and wings on 107"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"their backs are clearly visible, and their posture shows them to be aspiring skyward. But motives for a second spiritual life can scarcely be based on the finds in Mongolia. The deep-freezing used in the graves there-for that is what the chambers faced with wood and filled with ice amount to-is too much of this world and obviously intended for terrestrial ends. Why, and this question keeps on worrying us, did the ancients think that bodies prepared in this way achieved a state which would make reawakening possible? That is a puzzle for the time being. In the Chinese village of Wu Chuan is a rectangular tomb measuring 45 by 39 feet; in it lie the skeletons of 17 men and 24 women. Here, too, none of the skeletons shows signs of a violent death. There are glacier tombs in the Andes, ice tombs in Siberia, group and individual graves in China, Sumeria, and Egypt. Mumm ies have been found in the far north and in South Africa. And all the dead were supplied with the n e cessities for a new life, and all the tombs were so planned and built that they could survive for thousands of years . Is it all mere coincidence? Are they all merely individual fancies, strange whims on the part. of our ancestors? Or is there an ancient promise of corporeal return that is unknown to us? Who could have made it? Some 1O,000-year-old tombs were excavated at Jericho, and a number of 8,000-year-old heads, modeled in plaster of Paris, were found. That, too, is astonishing, for ostensibly this people did not know the techniques of pottery making. In another part of Jericho whole rows of round houses were discovered. The walls are curved inward at the top, like domes. The omnipotent carbon isotope C14 , with the aid of which the age of organic substances can be determined, gives dates with a maximum of 10,400 years in this case. These scientific ally determined dates agree fairly well with 108"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"the dates which the Egyptian priests transmitted. They said that their priestly ancestors had discharged their duties for more than 11,000 years. Is this only a coincidence, too? Prehistoric stones at Lussac, France, fonn a particularly remar kable find. They show drawings of men dressed in completely modern style, with hats, jackets, and short trousers . Abbe Breuil says that the drawings are authentic, and his statement throws the whole of prehistory into confus ion. Who engraved the stones? Who has enough im­ agination to conceive of a caveman dressed in skins who drew figures from the twentieth century on the walls? Some really magnificent Stone Age paintings were found in 1940 in the Lascaux caves in the South of France. The paintin gs in this gallery are as lively and intact as if they had been done today, and two questions immediately spring to mind. How was this cave illuminated for the laborious work of the Stone Age artists, and why were the walls decor­ �ted with these astonishing paintings? Let the people who consider these questions stupid ex­ plain the contra dictions. If the Stone Age cavemen were primitive and savage, they could not have produced the as­ tounding paintings on the cave walls. But if the savages were capable of painting these pictu res, why should they not also have been able to build huts as shelter? The foremost authorities concede that animals had the ability to build nests and shelters millions of years ago. But it obviously does not fit into the working hypothesis to concede homo sapiens the same ability as long ago as that. In the Gobi Desert, deep down below the ruins of Khara Khota-not far from those strange sand vitrifications which can only have taken place under the influence of tremen­ dous heat-Prof essor Koslov found a tomb that is dated to about 12,000 years B.C. A sarcophagus contained the bodies of two rich men, and the sign of a circle bisected vertica lly was found on the sarcophagus .

Among these colossal finds there are fabrics of such fineness and delicacy that with the best will in the world one cannot imagine savages making them. Questions, questions, questions. . . . The first doubts are beginning to insinuate themselves into sterotyped archaeological theory, but what we need to do is to force breaches in the thicket of the past. Land­ marks must be set up again; wherever possible, a new series of fixed dates must be established. Let me make it clear that I am not doubting the history of the last 2,000 years here. I am speaking solely and exclu­ sively of the most remote antiquity, of the blackest darkness of time, which I am striving to illuminate by asking new questions. Nor can I give any figures and dates showing when the visit of unknown intelli gences from the universe began to influ­ ence our young intelligences. But I venture to doubt the cur­ rent datings applied to the remote past. I would suggest, on tolerably good grounds, placing the incident I am con­ cerned with in the Early Paleolithic Age-between 10,000 and 40,000 B.C. Our hitherto existing methods of dating, including C-14, which makes everyone so happy, leave great gaps as soon as we have to deal with periods of fewer than 5,000 years . The older the substance to be examined, the more unreliable the radiocarbon method is. Even recognized scholars have told me that they consider the C-14 method to be an out-and-out bluff, because if an organ ic substance is from 30,000 to 50,000 years old its age can be established anywhere between those limits. These critical voices should be accepted only with limita­ tions; nevertheless, a second dating method parallel to the C-14 method and based on the latest measuring apparatus would unquestionably be desirable. 110"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"8 Easter Island-Land of the Bird Men T HE first European seafarers who landed on Easter Is­ land at the beginning of the eighteenth century could scarcely believ e their eyes. On this little plot of earth, 2,350 miles from the coast of Chile, they saw hund reds of colossal statues lying scattered about all over the island. Whole moun­ tain massifs had been transformed, steel-hard volcanic rock had been cut through like butter, and 10,000 tons of massive rocks lay in places where they could not have been dressed. Hu ndreds of gigan tic statues, some of which are between 33 and 66 feet high and weigh as much as 50 tons, still stare challengingly at the visitor today -like robots which seem to be waiting solely to be set in motion again. Originally these colossuses also wore hats ; but even the hats do not exactly help to explain the puzzling origin of the statues. The stone for the hats, which weighed more than ten tons apiece, was found at a different site from that used for the bodies, and in addition the hats had to be hoisted high in the air. Wooden tablets, covered with strange hieroglyphs, were also found on some of the statues in those days . But today it is impossible to find more than ten fragm ents of those tablets III"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"in all the museums in the world, and none of the inscriptions on those still extant has yet been deciphered. Thor Heyerdahl's investigations of these mysterious giants produced three clearly distinguishable cultu ral peri­ ods, and the oldest of the three seems to have been the most perfe ct. Heyerdah l dates some charcoal remains that he found to about A.D. 400. It has not been proved whether the fireplaces and remains of bones had any connection with the stone colo�uses. Heyerdahl discovered hundreds of unfin­ ished statues near rock faces and on the edges of craters ; thou­ sands of stone implements, simple stone axes, lay around as if the work had been abandoned quite suddenly. Easter Island lies far away from any continent or civiliza­ tion. The islanders are more familiar with the moon and the stars than any other country. No trees grow on the island, which is a tiny speck of volcanic stone. The usual explana­ tion, that the stone giants were moved to their presen t sites on wooden rollers, is not feasible in this case, either. In addi­ tion, the island can scarcely have provided food for more than 2,000 inhabitants. (A few hundred natives live on Easter Island today.) A shipping trade, which brought food and clothing to the island for the stonemasons, is hardly credible in antiquity. Then who cut the statues out of the rock, who carved them and transported them to t h eir sites? How were they moved across country for miles without rollers? How were they dressed, polished, and erected? How were the hats, the stone for which came from a different quarry from that of the statues, put in place? Even if people with lively imaginations have tried to pic­ ture the Egyptian pyramids being built by a vast army of workers using the \"heave-ho\" method, a similar method would have been impossible on Easter Island for lack of manpower. Even 2,000 men, working day and night, would not be nearly enough to carve these colossal figures out of the steel-hard volcanic stone with rudimentary tools-and 112"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"at least a part of the population must have tilled the barren fields, gone fishing, woven cloth, and made ropes. No, 2,000 men alone could not' have made the gigantic statues. And a larger population is inconceivable on Easter Island. Then who did do the work? And how did they manage it? And why do the statues stand around the edge of the island and not in the interior? What cult did they serve? Unfortunately, the first European missionaries on this tiny patch of earth helped to ensure that the island's dark ages stayed dark. They burned the tablets with hieroglyphic char­ acters ; they prohibited the ancient cults of the gods and did away with every kind of tradition. Yet thoroughly as the pious gentlemen went to work, they could not prevent the natives from calling their island the Land · of the Bi r d Men, as they still do today. An orally transmitted legend tells us that flying men landed and lighted fires in ancient times. The legend is confirmed by scul p tures of flying creatures with big, staring eyes. Connections between Easter Island and Tiah uanaco auto­ matically force themselves upon us. There as here, we find stone giants belonging to the same style. The haughty faces with their stoic expressions suit the statues-here as there. When Francisco Pizarro questioned the Incas about Tiahu­ anaco in 153 2, they told him that no man had ever seen the city save in ruins, for Tiahuanaco had been built in the night of mankind. Traditions call Easter Island the \"navel of the world .\" It is more than 3, 125 miles from Tiahuanaco to Easter Island. How can one cultu re possibly have inspired the other? Perhaps pre-Inca mythology can give us a hint here. In .it the old god of creation, Viracocha, was an ancient and ele­ mental divinity. Accord ing to tradi tion Viracocha created the world when it was still dark and had no sun; he sculpted a race of giants from stone, and when they displeased him, he sank them in a deep flood. Then he caused the sun and the 113"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"moon to rise above Lake Titicaca, so that there was light on earth. Yes, and then-read this closely-he shaped clay fig­ ures of men and animals at Tiahua naco and breathed life into them. Afterward, he instructed these living creatures of his own creation in language, customs, and arts, and finally flew some of them to different continents which they were supposed to inhabit thenceforth . After this task the god Vi­ racocha and two assistants travel ed to many countries to check how his instructions were being followed and what re­ sults they had had. Dressed as an old man, Viracocha wan­ dered over the Andes and along the coast, and often he was given a poor reception. Once, at Cacha, he was so annoyed by his welcome that in a fury he set fire to a cliff which be­ gan to bum up the whole country. Then the ungrateful peo­ ple asked his forgi veness, whereupon he extinguished the flames with a single gesture. Viracocha traveled on, giving in­ structions and advice, and many temples were erected to him as a result. Finally he said good-bye in the coastal province of Manta and disappeared over the ocean, riding on the waves, but he said he intended to come back. The Spanish conquistadors who conquered South and Central America came up against the sagas of Viracocha everyw here. Never before had they heard of gigantic white men who came from somewhere in the sky. Full of astonish­ ment, they learned about a race of sons of the sun who in­ structed mankind in all kinds of arts and disappeared again. And in all the legends that the Spaniards heard, there was an assurance that the sons of the sun would return. Although the American continent is the home of ancient cultures, our accurate knowledge of America is barely 1,000 years old. It is an absolute mystery to us why the Incas culti­ vated cotton in Peru in 3000 B.C., althoug h they did not know or possess the loom. The Mayas built roads but did not use the wheel, althoug h they knew about it.

No bridge in the country could stand their weight. We can move smaller \"monoliths\" weighing up to fifty tons with our modem lift­ ing appliances and loaders, but when it comes to hund red­ tonners like these our technology breaks down . But our an­ cestors could transport and dress them. How? It even seems as if the ancient peoples took a special pleas­ ure in jugg ling with stone giants over hill and dale. The Egyp­ tians fetched their obelisk from As wan, the architects of Stonehenge brought their stone blocks from southwest Wales and Marlborough, the stonemasons of Easter Island took their ready-made monster statues from a distant quarry to their present sites, and no one can say where some of the monoliths at Tiahuanaco come from. Our remote ancestors must have been strange peop le; they liked making things difficult for themselves and always built their statues in the most impo ssible places . Was it just because they liked a hard life? I refuse to think that the artists of our great past were as stupid as that. They could ju st as easily have erected their statues and temples in the immediate vicinity of the quarries if an old tradition had not laid down where their works ought to be sited. I am convinced that the Inca fortress of Sacsahuaman was not built above CUlCO by chance, but rather because a tradition indicated the place as a holy spot. I am also convinced that in all the places where the most an­ cient monumental bu ildings of mankind were found the most interes ting and important relics of our past lie still un­ touched in the ground, relics, moreover, which could be of tremendous importance fo r the further development of present-day space travel . 115"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"The unknown space travelers who visited our planet many thousands of years ago can hardly have been less farsighted than we think we are today. They were convinced that one day man would make the move out into the universe on his own initiative, using his own skills. It is a well-known historical fact that the intelli gences of our planet have constantly sought for kindred spirits, for life, for corresponding intelligences in the cosmos. Present-day antennae and transm itters have broadcast the first radio impulses to unknown intelligences. When we shall receive an answer-in ten, fifteen, or a hundred years -we do not know. We do not even know which star we should beam our message at, because we have no idea which planet should interest us most. Where do our signals reach unknown intellig ences similar to human beings ? We do not know. Yet there is much to support the belief that the infonnation needed to reach our goal is deposited in our earth for us. We are trying hard to neutralize the force of gravi ty; we are experimenting with elementary particles and antimatt er. Are we also doing enough to find the data which are hidden in our earth, so that we can at last ascertain our ori gi nal home? If we take things literally, much that was once fitted into the mosaic of our past with great difficulty becomes quite plausib le: not only the relevant dues in ancient texts but also the \"hard facts \" which offer themselves to our critical gaze all over the globe. Lastly, we have our reason to think with. So it will be man's ultimate insight to realize that his jus­ tification for existence to date and all his struggles to ad­ vance really consisted in learning from the past in order to make himself ready for contact with the existence in space.

Then the prom­ ise of the \"gods \" that peace will come on earth and that the way to heaven is open can come true. As soon as the available authorities, powers, and intellects are devoted to space research, the results will make the ab­ surdity of terrestrial wars abundantly clear. When men of all races, peoples, and nations unite in the supranational task of making journeys to distant planets technically feasible, the earth with all its mini-problems will fall back into its right relation with the cosmic processes . Occultists can put out their lamps, alchemists destroy their crucibles, secret brotherhoods take off their cowls. It will no longer be possible to offer man the nonsense that has been purveyed to him so brilliantly for thousands of years. Once the universe opens its doors, we shall attain a better future. I base the reasons for my skepticism about the interpre­ tation of our remote past on the knowledge that is available today.

Since mankind has existed, age-old traditions have lived on among the vari­ ous peoples. More recent cult ures, too, provide us with indi­ cations pointing to the remote, unknown past. Ruins in the jun gles of Guatemala and Yucatan can bear comparison with the colossal edifices of Egypt. The gro und area of the pyramid of Cholula, 60 miles south of the Mex­ ican capital, is bigger than that of the pyramid of Cheops. The pyramid field of Teotihuad.n, 25 miles north of Mexico City, covers an area of almost 8 square miles, and all the edifices are aligned according to the stars. The oldest text about Teotihuacan tells us that the gods assembled here and took council about man, even before homo sapiens existed! The calendar of the Mayas, the most accurate in the world, has already been mentioned, and so has the Venusian for­ mula. Today it is proved that all the edifices at Chichen Itza, Tikal, Copan, and Palenque were built according to the fab- 119"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"ulous Mayan: calendar. The Mayas did not build pyramids because they needed them; they did not build temples be­ cause they needed them; they built temples and pyram ids be­ cause the calendar decreed that a fixed number of steps of a building had to be completed every 52 years. Every stone has its relation to the calendar; every completed buil ding confonns exactly to certain astronom ical requirements. But an absolutely incredible thing happened about A.D. 6001 Suddenly, and for no apparent reason, a whole people left its laboriously and solidly built cities, with their rich temples, arti stic pyramids, squares lined with statues, and grandiose stadiums. The jungle ate its way through build­ ings and streets, broke up the masonry, and turned ever ything into a vast landscape of ruins. No inhabitant ever returned there. Let us pretend that this event. this enormous national migration, happened in ancient Egypt. For generations the people built temples. pyramids. cities, water conduits. and streets according to calendar dates; wonderfu l sculptures were laboriously carved out of stone with primitive tools and installed in the mag nificent buildings; when this work. last­ ing more than a mill ennium, was finished. they left their homes and moved to the barren north. Such a procedure, brought a little closer to the course of historical events that we are familiar with, seems incredible because it is ridicu­ lous. The more incomprehensible a procedure. the more nu­ merous the vague explanations and attempts at interpreta­ tion. The first version put forward was that the Mayas might have been driven out by foreign invaders . But who could have overcome the Mayas, who were at the peak of their civil­ ization and cult ure? No traces that could be connected with a mili tary confrontation have ever been found. The idea that the migration could have been caused by a marked change in climate is well worth considering. But there are no signs to support this view either. The distance covered by the 120"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Mayas from the territory of the old to the borders of the new kingdom measures only 220 miles as the crow flies-a dis­ tance that would have Ibeen inadequate to escape a cata­ strophical change in climate. The explanation that a devasta ting epidemic set the Mayas on the move also de­ serves serious examination. Apart from the fact that this ex­ planation is offered as one of many, there is not the slightest proof of it. Was there a battle between the generations? Did the young revolt against the old? Was there a civil war, a rev­ olution? If we opt for one of these possibilities, it is obvious that only a part of the population, namely the defeated, would have left the country and that the victors would have remained iii their old settlements. Investigations of archae­ ological sites have not prod uced one proof that even a single Maya remained behind. The whole people suddenly emi­ grated, leaving their holy places unguarded in the jungle. I should like to introduce a new note into the concert of opinions, a theory that is not proved any more than the other interpr etations are. But regardless of the probability of the other explanations, I venture to make my contribution boldly and with conviction. At some point in a very early period the Mayas' ancestors were paid a visit by the \"gods \" (in whom I suspect space traveler s). As a number of factors support the assump­ tion, the ancestors of the American cultural peoples may per­ haps have immigrated from the ancient Orient. But in the world of the Mayas there were strictly guarded sacred tradi­ tions about astronomy, mathematics, and the calendar l The priests guarded the tradi tional knowledge because the \"gods\" had given their word to return one day. They created a grandiose new religion, the religion of Kukulkan; the Feathered Serpent. According to priestly tradition, the gods would come back from heaven when the vast buildings were completed ac­ cording to the laws of the calendar cycle. So the people has- 121"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"tened to complete temples and pyramids according to this holy rhythm, because the year of completion was supposed to be a year of rejoicing. Then the god Kukulkan would come from the stars, take possession of the buildings, and from then on live among mankind. The work was finished, the year of the god's return came around-b ut nothing happened. The people sang, prayed, and waited for a whole year. Slaves and jewelry, corn and oil, were offered up in vain. But heaven remained dumb and without a sign. No heavenly chariot appeared; they could hear no rushing or distant thunder. Nothing, absolutely noth­ ing, happened. If we give this hypothesis a chance, the disappointment of priests and people must have been tremendous. The work of centuries had been done in vain. Doubts arose. Was there a mistake in the calculation of the calendar? Had the gods landed somewhere else? Had they all made a terrible mis­ take? I should mention that the mystical year of the Mayas, in which the calendar began, goes back to 3111 B.C. Proofs of this exist in Mayan writings . If we accept this date as proved, then there was only a gap of a few hundred years between it and the beginning of the Egyptian culture. This legendary age seems to be genuine, because the hyperaccurate Mayan calendar says so over and over again. If that is so, the calendar and the national migration are not the only things that make me skeptical. For a comparatively new find starts off nag­ ging doubts, too. In 1935 a stone relief that very probably represents the god Kukumatz (in Yucatan, Kuku lkan) was found in Pal­ enque (Old Kingdom). A genuinely unprej udiced look at this picture would make even the most die-hard skeptic stop and think.

His clothing is approp riate : short trou­ sers with a broad belt, a jacket with a modern Japanese open­ ing at the neck, and closely fitting bands at arms and legs. With our knowledge of similar pictures, we should be sur­ prised if the complicated headgear were missing. And there it is with the usual indentations and tubes, and something like antennae on top. Our space traveler-he is clearly de­ picted as one-is not only bent forward tensely; he is also looking intently at an apparatus hanging in front of his face . The astronaut's front seat is separated by struts from the rear portion of the vehicle, in which symmetrically arranged boxes, circles, points, and spirals can be seen. What does this relief have to tell us? Not hing? Is every­ thing that anyone links up with space travel a stupid figment of the imag ination? If the stone relief from Palenque is also rejected from the chain of proofs, one must doubt the integrity which scholars bring to the investigation of outstanding finds. After all, one is not seeing ghosts when one is analyzing actual obj ects. To continue with our series of hi therto unanswered ques­ tions: Why did the Mayas build their oldest cities in the jun­ gle, and not on a river, or by the sea? Tikal, for example, lies 109 miles as the crow flies from the Gulf of Honduras, 161 miles northwest of the Bay of Campeche, and 236 miles as the crow flies north of the Pacific Ocean. The fact that the Mayas were quite familiar with the sea is shown by the wealth of objects made of coral, mussels, and shellfish. Why, then, the \"flig ht\" into the jun gle? Why did they build water reservoirs when they could have settled by the water? In Tikal alone there are 13 reservoirs with a capacity of 214,504 cubic yards. 123"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Why did they absolutely have to live, build, and work here and not in some more \"logically\" situated place? After their long trek the disappointed Mayas founded a new kingdom in the north. And once again cities, temples, and pyramids arose according to the dates prefixed by the calendar. To give some idea of the accuracy of the Mayan calen dar, here are the periods of time they used: 20 kins 18 uinals 20 tuns 20 katuns 20 baktuns 20 pictuIis 20 cala btuns 20 kinchiltuns = 1 uinal or 20 days = 1 tun or 360 days = 1 katun or 7,200 days = 1 baktun or 144,000 days = 1 pictun or 21,880,000 days = 1 calabtun or 561,600,000 days = 1 kinchiltun or 12,1521,000,000 days = 1 atautun or 232,0401,000,000 days But the stone steps . based on calendar dates are not the only things that tower above the green roof of the jun gle, for observatories were built, too. The observatory at Chichen is the first and oldest round building of the Mayas. Even today the restored building looks like an observatory. The circular edifice rises far above the jungle on three terrac es; inside it a spiral stair­ case leads to the uppermost observation post; in the dome there are hatches and openings directed at the stars and giv­ ing an impressive picture of the firmament at riight. The outer walls bear masks of the rain god . . . and the image of a human figure with wings. Admittedly, the Mayas' interest in astronomy is not suf­ ficient motivation for our hypothesis of relations with intelli­ gences on other planets. The abundance of hitherto unan­ swered questions is bewilderi ng: How did the Mayas know about Uranus and Neptune? Why are the observation posts in the observatory at Chichen not directed at the brightest 124"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"stars? What does the stone relief of the rocket-driving god at Palenque mean? What is the point of the Mayan calendar with its calculations for 400,000,000 years? Where did they get the knowledge required to calculate the solar and Venusian years to four decimal places? Who transmitted their incon­ ceivable astronomical knowledge? Is every fact a chance prod uct of the Mayan intellect or does each fact, or rather do all the facts added together, conceal a revolutionary message for a very distant future, as seen from their point in time? If we put all the facts in a sieve and roughly separate the wheat from the chaff, there are so many inconsistencies and absurdities left that research needs spurring on to make a large-scale new effort to solve at least some of the enormous number of prob lems. For in our age research should no longer remain satisfied when confronted with so-called \"im­ pos sibilities.\" I have one more, rather gruesome story to tell, the story of the sacred well of Chichen Itza. From the stinking mud of this well Edward Herbert Thompson excavated not only jewelry and objects of art but also the skeletons of youths. Drawing on ancient accounts, Diego de Landa stated that in times of drought the priests used to make pilgrimages to the well to appease the wrath of the rain god by throwing boys and girls into it during a solemn ceremony. Thom pson's finds proved De Landa's claim. A horrifying story, which also brings up more questions from the bottom of the well . How did this water hole come into being? Why was it declared a sacred well? Why this well in particular, for there are several like it? The exact counterpart of the sacred well of Chichen Itza exists, hidden in the jungle, barely 76 yards from the Mayan observatory. Guarded by snakes, poisonous millip edes, and troublesome insects, the hole has the same measurements as the \"real\" well; its vertical walls are equally weathered, �'Vergrown. and swamped by the jungle. These two wells re- 1 25"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"semble each other most strikingly. The water is the same depth and the color shimmers from . green to brown and blood-red in both wells. Unquestionably the two wells are the same age, and poss ibly they both owe their existence to the impact of meteorites. Meanwhile, contemporary scholars speak only of the sacred well of Chichen Itzi; the second well, which is so similar, does not fit into their theories, although both wells are 984 yards away from the top of the biggest pyr amid, the Castillo. This pyr amid belongs to the god Ku­ kulkcin, the Feathered Serpent. The snake is a symbol of nearly all Mayan buildings. That is astonishing, for one would have expected a people sur­ rounded by luxuriant rampant flora to leave flower motifs behind on their stone reliefs as well. Yet the loathsome snake confronts us every where. From time immemorial the snake has wound its way through the dust and dirt of the earth . Why should anyone conceive of endowing it with the ability to fly? Primeval image of evil, the snake is condemned to cra wl. How could anyone worship this repulsive creature as a god, and why could it fly as well? Among the Mayas it could. The god Kukulkcin (Kukumatz) presumably corresponds to the figure of the later god Quetzalcoatl . What does the Mayan legend tell us about this Quetza1coatI? He came from an unknown country of the rising sun in a white robe, and he wore a beard. He taught the people all the sciences, arts, and customs, and left very wise laws. It was said that under his direction corncobs grew as big as a man and that cotton grew already colored. When Quetzal­ coatI had fulfilled his mission, he returned to the sea, preach­ ing his teaching en route, and boarded a ship there which took him to the morning star. It is almos t embarrassing for me to mention in addition that the bearded Quetzalcoad also promised to return. Natur ally there is no lack of explanations for the appear­ ance of the wise old man. A kind of messianic role is attrib- 126"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"uted t,o him, for a man with a beard is not an everyday oc­ currence in these latitudes. There is even a daring version which suggests that the old Quetzalcoatl was an earlier Jesus l That does not convince me. Anyone who arrived among the Mayas from the ancient world would have known about the wheel for transpor ting men and objects. Surely one of the first actions of a sage, a god like Quetzalcoatl, who appeared as missionary, lawgiver, doctor, and adviser on many practi­ cal aspects of life, would have been to instruct the poor Mayas in the use of the wheel and the cart. In fact the Mayas never used either. Let us complete the intellectual confusion with a com­ pendium of oddities from the dim past. In 1900 Greek sponge divers found an old wreck loaded with marble and bronze statues off Antikythera. These art treasures were rescued, and s � bsequent investigations showed that the ship must have foundered around the time of Christ. When all the plunder was sorted out, it included a shapeless lump that proved more important than all the statues put together. When it had been carefully treated, scholars discovered a sheet of bronze with circles, inscrip­ tions, and cog wheels and soon realized that the inscriptions must be connected with astronomy. When the many separate parts were cleaned, a strange construction came to light, a regular machine with movable pointers, complicated scales or dials and metal plates with writing. The reconstructed machine had more than twenty little wheels, a kind of dif­ ferential gear, and a crown wheel. On one side was a spindle that set all the dials in motion at varying speeds as soon as it was turned. The pointers were protected by bronze covers on which long inscriptions could be read. In the case of this \"machine from Antikythera,\" is there the slightest doubt that first-class precision mechanics were at work in antiquity? Moreover, the machine is so complicated that it was probably not the first of its kind. Professor So11a Price interpreted the 127"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"apparatus as a kind of calculating machine with the help of which the movements of the moon, the sun, and probably other planets could be worked out. The fact that the machine gives the year of its construc­ tion as 82 B.C. is not so important. It would be more interest­ ing to find out who built the first model of this machine, this small-scale planetari um I The Hoh enstaufen Emperor Frederick II is supposed to have brought back a most unusual tent from the east when he returned from the Fifth Crusade in 1229. In the interior of the tent stood a clockwork motor, and people watched the constellations in motion through the dome-shaped roof of the tent. Once again, a planetari um in olden times. We ac­ cept its existence at that date because we know that the neces­ sary mechanical skills existed then. The idea of the earlier planetarium irritates us because in Chris t's day the con­ cept of a heaven with fixed stars taking into account the ro­ tation of the earth did not exist. Even the knowledgeable Chinese and Ara bic astronomers of antiquity can give us no help regarding this inexplicable fact, and it is undeniable that Galileo Galilei was not born until 1,500 years later. Any­ one who goes to Athens should not miss the \"machine from Antikythera \"; it is on view in the Nat ional Arch aeological Museum. We possess only written accounts of Frederick II's tent planetarium. Here are some more strange things that antiquity has be­ queathed to us: Out line drawings of animals which simply did not exist in South America 10,000 years ago, namely camels and lions, were found on the rocks of the desert plateau of Marcahuasi 12,500 feet above sea level.

As I am at:J,xious not to enter into the realm of scientific argument unintelligible to the layman, I shall only give a few obvious and valid reasons for the absolute necessity of space resear ch. From time immemorial, curiosity and the thirst for knowl­ edge have always been the driving force for continuing re­ search on the part of man. The two questions, WHY did something happen? and HOW did it happen? have always been the spur to devel opment and progress . We owe our present-day standard of living to the permanent unrest that they created. Comfortable modern means of transport have removed the hardships of journeys which our grandfathers still had to suffer; many of the rigors of manual labor have 131"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"been noticeably alleviated by machines; new sources of energy, chemical preparations, refrigerators, various house­ hold appliances, etc., have completely liberated us from many activities that fonnerly could be done only by human hands. The creations of science have become not the curse but the blessing of mankind. Even its most terrifying offspring, the atom bomb, will tum out to be for the benefit of mankind. Today science reaches many of its goals with seven-league boots. It took 112 years for photography to develop to the stage of a clear picture. The telephone was ready for use in 56 years, and only 35 years of scientific research were needed to develop radio to the point of perfect reception. But the perfecting of radar took only 15 years. The stages of epoch­ making discoveries and developments are getting shorter and shorter; black-and- white television was on view after 12 years' research, and the construction of the first atom bomb took a mere 6 years . These are a few examples from 50 years of technical progress- magnificent and even a little frighten­ ing. Development will continue to reach its targets faster and faster. The next hundred years will realize the majority of mankind's eternal dreams . The human spirit has made its way in the face of opposi­ tion and warnings. In the face of the archaic writing on the wall saying that water was the fishes' element and air the birds' element, man has conquered the regions which were not apparently intended for him. Man flies, against all the so-called laws of nature, and he lives under water for months in nucl ear-powered submarines. Using his intell igence, he has made himself wings and gills which his creator had not intended for him. When Charles Lindbergh began his legendary flight, his goal was Paris; obviously he was not really concerned with getting to Paris; he wanted to demonstr ate that man could fly the Atlantic alone and unhanned. The first goal of space travel was the moon. But what this new scientific-cum- 132"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"technical proj ect really wants to prove is that m im can also master space. So why space travel? In only a few centuries our globe will be hopelessly and irre mediably ove rpopulated. Statistics already calculate a world population of 8.7 billion for the year 2050. Barely 200 years later it will be 50 bill ion, and then 335 men will have to live on one square kilometer. It doe sn't bear thinking aboutl The tranquil izer like theories of food from the sea or even cities on the floor of the sea will prove inefficient reme­ dies agai nst the population explosion sooner than their opti­ mistic supporters would like to think. In the first six months of 1966 more than 10,000 people, who had tried in despera­ tion to keep themselves alive by eating snails and plants, starved to death on the Indonesian island of Lombok. U Thant, Secretary General of the Unit ed Nations, estimates the number of children in danger of dying of hunger in India at 20,000,000, a figure which backs up Dr. Hermann Mohler of Zurich's claim that hunger is reaching for world domina­ tion. It has been proved that world food pro duction does not keep pace with the growth of population, in spite of the most modern technical aids and the large-scale use of chemical fert ilizers. Thanks to chemistry, the pres ent age also has birth control prod ucts at its disposal. But what use are they if the women in underdeveloped countries do not use them? For food pro duction could draw level with the population in­ crease only if it were poss ible to halve the birth rate in ten years, i.e., by 1980. Unfortunately I cannot believe in this ra· tional solution, because the \"sound barrier\" of prej udice, ostensibly due to ethical motives and religious laws, cannot be broken through as quickly as the calamity of overpopula­ tion grows. Is it more human or even divine to let mill ions of people die of hunger year after year than to save the poor creatures from being born? 133"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Yet even if birth control were to win through one fine day, even if cultivatable areas were enlarged and harvests multi­ plied by aids as yet unknown, even if fishing supplied much more food and fields of algae on the ocean bed provided nourishment, if all this and a lot more were to happen, it would all be only a postponement, a putting off of the evil day for about 100 years. I am convinced that one day men will settle on Mars and cope with the climatic conditions just as the Eskimos would do if they were trans planted to Egypt. Planets, reached by gigantic spaceships, will be populated by our children's chil­ dren; they will colonize new worlds, just as America and Australia were colonized in the comparatively recent past. That is why we must press on with space research . We must bequeath our grandchildren a chance to sur­ vive. Every generation which neglects this duty is condemn­ ing the whole of mankind to death by starvation some time in the future. It is no longer a question of abstrac t research which is of interest only to the scientist. And let me impress on anyone who does not feel that he is respons ible for the future that the results of space research have already protected us from a third world war. Has not the threat of total annihilation pre­ vented the great powers' from settling opinions, challenges, and conflicts with a major war? It is not necessary now for a Russian soldier to set foot on American soil in order to trans­ form the Unit ed States into a desert, and no American sol­ dier need ever die in Russia, because an atom bomb attack makes a country uninhabitable and barren owing to radio­ activity. It may sound absurd, but the first intercontinental missiles guaranteed us comparative peace. The view is occasionally put forward that the billions in­ vested in space research would be better spent on assisting de­ velopment. This view is wrong; the industrial nations do not give aid to underdeveloped countries purely on charitabl e 134"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"or political gro unds ; they also give it, understandably enough, to open up new markets for their own industries. The aid that the underde veloped · countries require is irrelevant from a long-term point of view. Approximately 1.6 billion rats, each of which destroyed about 10 pounds of food a year, were living in India in 1966. Yet the state does not dare exterminate this plague, because the devout Indian protects rats. India also has a population of 80,000,000 cows, which give no milk, cannot be harnessed as draft animals, and cannot be slaughtered. In a backward country whose development is hindered by so many religious taboos and laws, it will take many generations to sweep away all the life-endangering rites, customs, and supers titions. Here, too, the means of communication of the age of space travel-n ewspapers, radio, television -serve progress and enlightenment. The world has become smaller. We know and learn more about one another. But to arrive at the ulti­ mate insight that national frontiers are a thing of the past, space travel was needed. The resulting increase in technology will spread the realization that the insignificance of peoples and continents in the dimensions of the universe can only be a stimulu s and incentive to cooperative work on space re­ search. In every epoch mankind has needed an inspiriting watchword that enabled it to rise beyond the obvious prob­ lems to the apparently unattainable reality. A quite considera ble factor which provides an important argu ment for space research in the industrial age is the ap­ pearance of new branches of industry, in which hundreds of thousands of people who lost their jobs through automa­ tion now earn their living. The space industry has already outstripped the auto ni obile and steel industries as a pace­ setter in the mark et. More than 4,000 new articles owe their existence to space research; they are virtually by-prod ucts of research for a higher goal. These by-prod ucts have become an accepted part of everyday life without anyone giving a 135"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"thought . about their ongm. Electronic calculating ma­ chines, mini-transmitters and min i-receivers, transistors in radio and television sets, were discovered on the periphery of resear ch, and so were the frying pans in which food does not stick. Precision instruments in all aircraft, fully auto­ matic gro und control systems and automatic pilots, and the rapidly developed computer are parts of the space research that has so many per secutors, parts of a developmen t pro­ gram, that also have an effect on the private lives of individ­ uals. The things of which the layman has no idea are legion : new welding and lubricating processes in an absolute vac­ uum, photoelectric cells and new tiny sources of energy con­ quering infinite distances. Out of the flood of taxes which is poured into space re­ searc h, the returns on the vast investment flow back to the taxpayer in a steady stream. Nations that do not participate in space research in any way will be overwhelmed by the technical revol ution. Names and concepts such as TeIstar, Echo, Relay, Trios, Mariner, Ranger, and Syncom are sign­ posts on the road of irre sistible resear ch. Since terrestrial supplies of energy are not inexhaustible, the space travel program will also become vital one day, be­ cause we shall have to obtain fissionable matter from Mars or some other planet in order to be able to illuminate our cities and heat our houses. As atomic power stations provide the cheapest form of energy already today, industrial mass pro­ duction will be fully dependent on these stations only when the earth no longer yields fissionable matter. Fresh conse­ quences of research overwh elm us daily. The leisurely trans­ mission of acquired knowledge from father to son is over for­ ever. A technician who repairs a radio set that works by sim­ ply pre ssing a button must know all about the technolo gy of tran sistors and complicated circuits that are often printed on sheets of plastic. It will not be long before he also has to deal with the tiny new components of microelectron ics. What the 136"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"apprentice is taught today, the jou rneyman will have to fill out with new knowledge . And even if the man who was mas­ ter of his craft in the days of our grandfathers had knowledge to last his whole life, the master of the present and future will constantly have to keep on adding new skills to old. What was valid yesterday is obsolete tomorrow. Even though it will take millio ns of years, our sun will burn out and die one day. It does not even need that terrible mo­ ment when a statesman loses his nerve and sets the atomic annihilation apparatus in motion to cause a catastrophe. An unascertai nable and unpredictable cosmic event could bring about the earth's downfall. Man has never yet accepted the idea of such a possibil ity, and it may be for that reason that he devoutly sought the hope of an afterlif e of the spirit and soul in one of the many thousand religions. So I suggest that space research is not the product of his free choice but that he is following a strong inner compul­ sion when he examines the pros pects of his future in the universe. Just as I proclaim the hypothesis that we received visits from space in the dim and distant past, I also assume that we are not the only intellig ences in the cosmos-indeed I suspect that there are older, more advanced intell igences in the universe. If I now also assert that all the intell igences are carr ying on space research. on their own initiative, I am really moving into the world of science fiction for a moment, knowing full well that I am putting my head into a hornets' nestl \"Flying saucers\" have been appearing on and off for at least twenty years ; in the literature on the subject they are known as UFO's, unidentified flying objects. But before I deal with the exciting subject of the mysterious UFO's, I should just like to mention an important argument used when the justification for space travel is under discussion. It is said that research into space travel is unprofitable; no country, however rich, can raise the enormous amounts of 137"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"money needed without risking national bankruptcy. True, research per se has never been profitable; it is the products of research that make the investment profitable. It is unrea­ sonable to expect profitableness and the amortization of re­ search into space travel at its pres ent stage. No balance has been struck to show the return from the 4,000 by-products of space resear ch. To me there is absolutely no doubt that it will give a return such as has seldom been given by any other kind of resear ch. When it reaches its goal, not only will it be profitable, but it will also bring the salvation of mankind from downfal l in the lite ral sense of the word. Incidentally, a whole series of COMSA T satellites are already sound com­ mercial propos itions. In November, 1967, the German magaz ine Der Stem said: The majority of medical life-saving machines come hom America.

General Electric improved this little miracle of medical technology last year when it developed a two·speed model. If the wearer of this appliance wants to play tennis or run to catch a train, he simply moves a bar magnet up and down for a moment over the spot where his built -in generator is located. His heart promptly works at a higher speed. Two more examples of by-products of space research. Who still has the nerve to say that it is useless? Under the headline \"Stimulus from Moon Rockets,\" the newspaper Die Zeit contained the following report in Novem­ ber, 1967 : The designs of space vehicles developed for soft landings on the moon have an int erim int erest for automobile manu­ facturers, for the knowledge of how such designs behave under conditions which cause their destruction can be appreciably increased. Even though it will not be possible to make cars safe for the passengers against all kinds of collisions, the designs used with most success in space travel can help to diminish the risk when collisions occur. \"Honey-comb\" sheets, which are being used more and more in modern aircraft con­ struction, guarantee high tensile strength with little weight. They have also been practically tested in automobile manu­ facture. The floor of the experimental gas-tur bine-driven Rover car is made of \"honey-combs.\" Anyone who knows the present state of research and the impetuous way in which it develops can no longer tolerate sayings such as, \"It will never be possible to travel from one star to anot her.\" The younger generation of our day will see this \"impossibility\" become reality.

One sector of space research is already working on a kind of protective screen, like an electric rainbow, which is attached in front of the actual capsule and is intended to prevent or deflect the im­ pact of particles. A gro up of distinguished physicists is trying to detect what are known as tachyons, theoretical particles which are supp osed to fly faster than light and whose lower speed limit is the speed of light. Scien tists know that tachyons must exist; it is now \"only\" a matter of providing physical proof of their existence. Yet such proofs have actually been produced for neut rinos and antimatter I Finally I should like to ask the die-hard critics in the chorus of opponents of space travel: Do you really believe that several thousands of probably the cleverest men of our time would waste their impassioned work on a pure Utopia or a trivial goal? So let me tackle UFO's boldly, ignoring the risk of not be­ ing taken seriously. If I am not taken seriously, I can at least console myself with the knowledge that I am in dis­ tingUished company. UFO's have been sighted in America and over the Philip­ pines, in West Germany and elsewhere. Let us assume that 98 percent of the people who claimed that they had seen UFO's actually saw ball lightning, weather balloons, strange cloud formations, new unknown types of aircraft, or even odd effects of light and shade in the sky at twilight. Undoub tedly, too, many people were the victims of mass hysteria. They claimed to have seen something that simply was not there. And of course there were also the public ity-seekers who wanted to make capital out of their alleged observations and produce banner headlines for the press in the silly season. If we reject all the crackpots, liars, hysterics, and sensation­ mongers, there still remains a sizable grou p of sober observ­ ers, including people whose jobs make them familiar with celestial phenomena. A simple housewife may have made the 140"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"same mistake as a farmer in the Wild West. But when, for example, a sighting of UFO's is made by an experienced air­ line pilot. it is hard to dismi ss it as humbug. For an airline pilot is familiar with mirages, ball lightning, weather bal­ loons, etc. The reactions of all his senses. including his first­ class vision, are regularly tested; he is not allowed to drink alcohol for some hours before takeoff and during flights. And an airline pilot is hardly likely to talk nonsense, because he would lose his nice, well-paid job only too easily. Yet when not merely one airline pilot. but a whole group of pilots (in­ cluding Air Force men), tell the same story, we are bound to listen to it. I myself do not know what UFO's are; I do not say that they have been proved to be flying objects belonging to unknown inte lligences. although there could be little ob­ jection to such a supposition. Unf ortunately I have never seen a UFO with my own eyes during my worldwide travels, \" but I can reproduce here some credible, authenticated ac­ counts : On February 5, 1965, the U.S. Department of Def ense an­ nounced that the Special Division for UFO' s had been in­ structed to investigate the reports of two radar operators. On January 29, 1965, these two men had spotted two uniden­ tified fiying objects on their radar screen at the Naval Air­ field in Maryland. These objects approached the airfield from the south at the enormous speed of 4,350 miles an hour. Thirty miles above the airfield the objects made a sharp turn and quickly disappeared out of radar range. On May 3, 1964, various people at Canberra, Australia, in­ cluding three mete orologists, observed a large shining flying object cross ing the morning sky in a northeasterly direction. During an interrog ation by delegates of NASA the eye­ witnesses described how the \"thing\" had tumbled about in a strange way and how a smaller object had rushed at the large one. The small object had given off a red glow and then been 141"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"obliter ated, while the large \"thing\" had disappeared from view in a northwesterly direction. One of the meteorologists said resignedly, \"I've always ridiculed these UFO stories. What the hell am I going to say now?\" On November 23, 1953, an unidentified flying object was picked up on the radar screen of the Kinross Air Base in Michigan. Flight Lieutenant R. Wilson, who happened to be on a training flight in an F-86 jet aircraft, was given per­ mission to chase the \"thing.\" The radar crew watched Wil­ son pursuing the unidentified object for 160 miles. Suddenly both flying bodies merged with one another on the radar screen. Radio calls to Wilson were unanswered. During the next few days, the region in which the inexplicable event took place was combed for wreckage by search troops, and nearby Lake Sup erior was examined for traces of oil. They found nothing. There was absolutely no trace of Flight Lieu­ tenant Wilson and his machinel On September 13, 1965, shortly before one in the morning, Police Sergeant Eugene Bertrand came across a distracted woman at the wheel of her car in a bypass at Exeter, New Hampshire. The lady refused to drive on and claimed that a gigan tic gleaming -red flying object had pursued her for ten miles to Route 101 and then disappeared into the forest. The policeman, an elderly, level-headed man, thought the lady was a bit crazy, until he heard the same report from another patrol over his car radio. Speaking from headquar­ ters, his colleague Gene Toland ordered him to return there at once. There a young man told him the same story as the lady; he too had sought refuge in the ditch from a glowing red object. Rather unwillin gly the men went on a car patrol, con­ vinced that the whole silly story would have a rational ex­ planation. They searched the district for two hOUTS, then they set off on the return journey. They passed a field in which stood six horses that suddenly stampeded madly 142"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"out of it. Almost simul taneously the region was bathed in glowing red light. \"There. Look there !\" shouted a young policeman. Indeed, a fiery red object, which moved slowly and silently toward the observers, 'Was floating above the trees. Bertrand excitedly informed his colleague Toland over the telephone that he had just seen the damned thing with his own eyes. Now the farm near the road and the neighbor­ ing hill were also bathed in glowing red light. A second police car screeched to a halt next to the men. \"God damn it!\" stuttered Dave. \"I heard you and Toland yelling to each other over the radio. I thought you'd gone crazy. But just look at that!\" Fifty-eight qualified eyewitnesses came forward during the investigation of the mysterious incident that was sub­ sequently carried out. They included meteorologists and members of the Coast Guard-in other words, men who as reliable observers were scarcely likely not to be able to tell a weather balloon from a helicopter, or a falling satellite from the navigation lights of an aircraft. The report contained factual statements but did not give any explanation of the unidentified flying object. On May 5, 1967, the mayor of Marliens in the Cote-d 'Or, Monsieur Malliotte, discovered a strange hole in a field of clover 680 yards from the road. He found traces of a circle with a diameter of 15V2f eet and a depth of 1 foot. Deep fur­ rows 4 inches deep ran out in all directions from this circle. They gave the impression that a heavy metal grating had been pressed into the ground. At the end of the furrows were holes 1 foot 2 inches deep, which might have been impressed in the soil by \"feet\" at the end of the metal grating. An ex­ ceptionally curious feature was the violet-white dust which was depo sited in the furrows and holes. I have inspected this place near Marliens personally.

They only blur our view of reality and deter serious scholars from dealing with verified phenomena because they are afraid of exposing themselves to ridicule. On November 6, 196 7, during a transmission by German television on the subject \"Invasion from the Cosmos?\" the captain of a Lufthansa aircraft told of an incident of which he and four members of the crew were eyewitnesses. On Februa ry 15, 1967, about te,n to fifteen minutes before land­ ing in San Francisco, they saw close to their own machine a flying object with a diameter of about 33 feet that shone dazzlingly and flew alongside them for some time. They sent their observations to the Unive rsity of Colorado, which for want of a better explanation surmised that the flying ob­ ject was part of a previously launched rocket falling to the ground. The pilot explained that with more than a million miles of flying experience he was as unable as his coll eagues to belie ve that a falling piece of metal could stay in the air for a quarter of an hour, have such dimensions, and fly along­ side an aircraft; he beli eved this explanation even less since this unidentified flying object had been observable from the ground for nearly three-quarters of an hour. The German pilot certainly did not give the impression of being a vision­ ary. Two reports from Die Suddeu tsche Zeitung, Munich, November 21 and 23, 1967: Belgrade (From our own corres pondent) : Unidentified fly­ ing objects (UFO's) have been sighted over various districts of southeast Europe during the last few days. At the weekend an amateur astronomer photographed three of these gleaming celestial objects at Agram. But while the experts were still giving their opinions of this photograph that was splashed across several columns of the Yugoslavian papers, more UFO's have already been reported from the mountainous region of 144"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Montenegro, where they were even supposed to have caused several for est fires. These accounts come mainly from the vil­ lage of Ivangrad where the inhabitants swear black and blue that they have observed strange brightly illuminated heavenly bodies every evening during the last few days.

According to the report of the Bulgarian News Agency BTA, the UFO could be recognized with the naked eye. BTA says that the flying body was \"bigger than the sun's disc and later took the shape of a trapeze.\" The flying body is supposed to have emitted powerful rays. It was also observed by tele­ scope in Sofia. A scientific collaborator of the Bulgarian In­ stitute for Hydrology and Meteorology said that the flying body apparently moved under its own power. It was flying about 18 miles above the earth. People block the road to serious research by boundless stupidity. There are \"contact men\" who claim to be in com­ munication with extraterrestrial beings; there are groups who develop fanci ful religious ideas from hitherto unexplained phenomena or build cranky philosophies of life fro m them or even claim to have received orders for the salvation of man­ kind from UFO crews . Among the religious fanatics, the Egyp tian \"UFO angel\" naturally comes from Mohammed, the Asiatic one from Buddha, and the Christian one directly from Jesus. At the 7th International Worl d Congress of UFO Investi­ gators , in the autumn of 1967, Professor Hermann Oberth, the man known as \"the father of space trave l\" and the teacher of Wernher von Braun, said that UFO's were still \"an extra-s cientific problem\"; but, said Oberth, UFO's were probably \"space ships from unknown worlds,\" and to use his own words : \"Obviously the beings who man and fly them are far ahead of us culturally, and if we go about things properly 145"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"we can learn a lot from them.\" Oberth, who accurately pre­ dicted rocket development on earth, suspects that the pre­ requisites for abiogenesis exist on other planets in the solar system. Oberth, a research scientist himself, demands that serious scientists, too, should tackle problems that may seem fantastic at first. \"Scholars behave like stuffed geese who re­ fuse to digest anything else. They simply reject new ideas as nonsens e.\" On November 17, 1967, under the headlin e \"Second Thoughts,\" Die Zeit said: For years the Russians have ridiculed W e s te rn hysteria about flying saucers. Not long ago Pravda contai ned an of­ ficial denial that such peculiar celestial vehicles existed. Now Air Force General Anatolyi Stolyakov has been appoint ed di­ rector of a committee which is to examine all reports of UFO's. In this connection the London Times writes : \"Whether UFO's are the product of collective hallucinations, whether they originate from Venusian visitors or are to be understood as a divine revelation-there must be an explanation for them, otherwise the Russians would never have set up a Committee of Inquiry.\" The most spectacular and puzzling incident connected with the phenomenon of \"matter from the universe\" took place at 7: 17 on the morning of 1 uly 30, 1908, in the Siberian Taiga. A fireball shot across the sky and was lost in the steppe. Trav­ elers on the Trans-Siberian Railway observed a glowering mass which moved from south to north. A thunderbolt shook the train, explosions followed, and most of the seismographic stations in the world registered an appreciable earth tremor. At Irkutsk, 550 miles from the epicenter, the needle of the seismograph went on quivering for nearly an hour. The noise could be heard over a radius of 62 1 miles. Whole herds of reindeer were destroyed. Nomads were whirled up into the air with their tents. 146"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Not until 1921 did Professor Kulik begin to collect eye­ witness accounts . Finally he also succeeded in collecting the money for a scientific expedition to this sparsely populated region of the Taiga. Whe n the expedition members reached the stony Tun­ guska in 1927, they were convinced that they would find the crater made by a gigan tic meteorite. Their conviction turned out to be quite wrong. They saw the first trees without tops as much as 37 miles from the center of the explosion. The nearer they came to the critical point, the more barren the district became. Trees stood there like shaved telegraph poles ; in the vicinity of the center even the strongest trees had been snapped off outward. Lastly they found traces of a tremendous conflagr ation. Pushing on farther north, the ex­ pedition became convinced that a vast explosion must have taken place. When they came across holes of all sizes in swampy ground they suspected the impact of meteorites; they dug and drilled In the marshy ground without finding a sin­ gle remnant, a piece of iron, a bit of nickel, or a lump of stone. Two years later the search was continued with bigger drills and improved technical resources . They drilled to a depth of 118 feet without finding a single trace of any kind of meteoric material. In 1961 and 1963 two more expeditions were sent to the Tunguska by the Soviet Academy of Sciences. The 1963 ex­ pedition was under the leader ship of the geophysician Solo­ tov. This group of scientists, now equipped with the most modern technical appliances, came to the conclusion that the explosion in the Siberian Tunguska must have been a nuclear one. The type of an explosion can be determined when several phys ical orders of magnitude that caused it are known. One of these orders of magni tude in the Tunguska explosion was known in the vast amount of radiant energy emitted. In the Taiga the expedition found trees 11 miles from the center 147"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"of the explosion that had been exposed to radiation and set on fire by it at the moment of explosion. But a growing tree can catch fire only if the amount of radiant energy per square centimeter reaches 70 to 100 calories. Yet the flash of the ex­ plosion was so bright that it continued to cast secondary shad­ ows at a distance of 124 miles from the epicenter! From these measurements the scientists worked out that the radiant energy of the explosion must have been around 2.8 X 1023 ergs. (The erg in science is the &<><alled \"measure­ ment of work.\" A beetle weighing one gram performs I erg's worth of work when it climbs a wall 1 centimeter high.) The expedition found branches and twigs on the tops of trees that had been carbonized, up to a range of eleven miles. From this they conclu ded that sudden heating had taken place. This was the result of an explosion, not a forest fire! These carbonizations were found only where there had been no shadows to interrupt the diffusion of the flash. Clearly and unq uestionably it must have been a case of radiation. The sum of all these effects makes the force of 1021 ergs neces­ sary for the gigan tic devas tation. This immense energy cor­ responds to the destructive power of an atom bomb weighing 10 megatons or 100,000,000,000,00 0,000,000,000 ergs! The investigations confirmed a nuclear explosion and rele­ gated to the realm of fable explanations such as the impact of a comet or the fall of a great meteorite. What explanations are offered for this nuclear explosion in the year 1908? In March, 1964, an article in the reputable Leni ngrad paper Svesda put forward the theory that intelligent beings living on a planet in the constellation Cygnus had tried to make contact with the earth. The authors, Genrich Altov and Valentina Shuraleva, said that the impact in the Siberian Taiga was a response to the colossal explosionlike eruption of the volcano of Krakatoa in the Indian Ocean, which sent 148"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"a large concentra tion of radio waves into the universe when it erupted in 1883. The distant stellar beings had er­ roneously taken the radio waves for a signal from space; so they had directed a laser beam, which was much too strong, at the earth, and when the beam hit the earth's atmosphere high above Siberia, it had turned into matter. I must admit that I do not accept this explanation because it seems too far­ fetched. I am equally unable to accept the theory that seeks to ex­ plain the incident by the impact of antimatter. Even though I believe that there is antimatter in the depths of the cosmos, there cannot be any left in the Tunguska, because the colli­ sion of matter and antimatter results in their mutual dissolu­ tion. Moreover, the possibility of a piece of antimatter reach­ ing the earth without a collision with matter on its long jour­ ney is very remote. I prefer to adhere to the opinion of those who suspect that the nuclear explosion was caused by an unknown space­ ship's energy pile bursting. Fantastic? Of course, but does that mean that it must be imposs ible? There are shelves and shelves of lite rature about the Tun­ guska meteorites. One further fact I want to emphasize: radioactivity around the center of the explosion in the Taiga is twice as high-even today-as elsewhere. Careful investi­ gation of trees and their annual rings confirm an appreciable increase in radioactivity since 1908. Until a single, exact, indubitable scientific proof of the phenomenon-and many others-is produced, no one has the right to discard an explanation within the bounds of credibility without giving his reasons. Our knowledge of the planets in our solar syst em-is rather compreh ensive; Mars is the only planet on which \"lif e\" in our sense of the word might exist and then only in limited quantities. Man has set the theoretical boundary to the pos­ sibility of life in this sense ; this boundary is called the 149"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"ecos phere. In our solar system only Venus, the Earth, and Mars lie within the limits of the ecos phere. Nevertheless, we should remember that the detennination of the ecosphere is based on our conception of life and that unknown life is by no means necessarily bound to our premises for life. Until 19 62 Venus was considered to be a p ossible home for life. Then Mariner II got within about 21,000 miles of Venus . Ac­ cording to the infonnation it trans mitted, Venus can now be ruled out as a supporter of life. It emerged from Mariner II's reports that the average sur­ face temperature on both light and dark sides was 4200 c. Such a temperature means that there could be no water, only lakes of molten metal on the surface . The popular idea of Venus as the twin sister of the earth is over and done with, even though the carbureted hydrogen present could be a cul­ ture medium for all kinds of bacteria. It is not long since scientists claimed that life on Mars is inconceivable. For some tim� now that has become \"is scarcely conceiva ble.\" For after the successful reconnaissance mission by Mariner IV we must concede, even if reluctantly, that the possibility of life on Mars is not unlikely. It is also within the bounds of possibility that our neighbor Mars had its own civilization untold millennia ago. In any case the Martian moon Phobos deserves special attention. Mars has two moons : Phobos and Deimos (in Greek, Fear and Terro r). They were known long before the American as­ tronomer Asaph Hall discovered them in 1877. As early as 1610 Johannes Kepler suspected that Mars was accompanied by two satellites. Although the Capucine monk Schyrl may have claimed to have seen the Martian moons a few years ear­ lier, he must have been mistaken, for the tiny Martian moons could not possibly have been seen with the optical instru­ ments of his day. A fascinating description of them is given by Jonathan Swift in A Voyage to Laputa and Ja pan, which forms Part III of Gull iver's Trav els. Not only does he describe 150"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"the two Martian moons, but he also gives their size and orbits. This quotation comes from Chapter 3: [The Laputan astronomers] spend the greatest part of their lives in observing the celestial bodies, which they do by the assistance of glasses far excelling ours in goodness. For al­ though their largest telescopes do not exceed three feet, they magnify much more than those of a hundred yards among us, and at the same time show the stars with greater clearness. This advantage hath enabled them to extend their discoveries much further than our astronomers in Europe for they have made a catalogue of ten thousand fixed stars, whereas the larg es t of ours do not contain above one third part of that number. They have likewise discovered two lesser stars, or satellites, which revolve about Mars, whereof the innermost is distant from the centre of the primary planet exactly three of the diameters, and the outermost five; the former. revolves in the space of ten hours, and the latter in twenty one and an hal£; so that the squares of their periodical times are very near in the same proportion with the cubes of their distance from the centre of Mars, which evidently shows them to be governed by the same law of gravitation, that influences the other heavenly bodies. How could Swift describe the Martian satellites when they were not discovered until 150 years la�er? Undoubt edly the Martian satellites were suspected by some astronomers before Swift, but suspicions are not nearly enough for such precise data. We do not know where Swift got his knowledge . Actually these satelli tes are the smallest and strangest moons in our solar system. They rotate in almost circular orbits above the equator. If they reflect the same amount of light as our moon, then Phobos must have a diameter of 10 miles and Deimos one of only 5 miles. But if they are arti­ ficial moons and so reflect still more light, they would actually be even smaller. They are the only known moons in our solar system that move around their mother planet 151"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"faster than she herself rotates. In relation to the rotation of Mars, Phobos completes two orbits in one Martian day, whereas Deimos moves only a little faster around Mars than the planet itself rotates. In 1862, when the earth was in a very favorable position in relation to Mars, people sought in vain for the Martian satel­ lites-they were not discovered until fifteen years later I The theory of planetoids came up because several astronomers suspected that the Martian moons were fragm ents from space which Mars had attracted. But the theory of planetoids is untenable, for both . the Martian moons revolve in almost the same planes above the equator. One fragment from space might do that by chance, but not two. Finally, measurabl e facts produced the modern satellite theory. Russian scientist I. S. Shklovskii and renowned American astonomer Carl Sagan, in their book Intelligent Life in the Universe, published in 1966, accept that the moon Phobos is an artificial satellite. As the result of a series of measure­ ments, Sagan came to the conclusion that Phobos must be hollow and a hollow moon cannot be natural. In fact, the peculiarities of Phobos' orbit bear no relation to its apparent mass, whereas such orbits are typical in the case of hollow bodies. Shklovskii, director of the Depart­ ment of Radi o-As tronomy in the Moscow Sternberg Astrolo­ gical Institute, made the same statement after he had ob­ served that a. peculiar unnatural acceleration could be con­ firmed in the movement of Phobos. This acceleration is identical with the phenomenon which has been established in the case of our own artificial satellites. Today people take these fantastic theories of Sagan and Shklovskii very seriously. Further Martian probes are planned, also intended to take the bearings of the Martian moons. In the years ahead, the Russians intend to observe the movements of the Martian moons from several observato ries. If the view supported by reputable scientists East and West that Mars once had an advanced civilization is correct, 152"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"the question arises: Why does it no longer exist today? Did the intelli gences on Mars have to seek a new environment? Did their home planet, which was losing more and more oxy­ gen, force them to look for new territories to settle? Was a cosmic catastrophe respons ible for the downfall of the civiliza­ tion? Lastly, were some of the inhabitants of Mars able to es­ cape to a neighboring planet? In his book Worlds in Co llision, published in 1950 and still much discussed in scientific circles, Immanuel Velikovsky declared that a giant comet had crashed into Mars and that Venus had been formed as a result of this collision. His theory can be proved if Venus has a high surface temperature, clouds containing carbureted hydrogen, and an anomalous rota­ tion. Evaluation of the data provided by Mariner II confirms Velikovsky's theory. Venus is the only planet which rotates \"backwar d,\" i.e., the only planet that does not follow the rules of our solar system as do Mercury, the Earth, Mars, Ju­ piter, S�turn, Uranus, and Neptune. But if a cosmically caused catastrophe is a poss ible rea­ son for the destruction of a civilization on the planet Mars, that would also provide material for my theory that the earth may have received visits from space in the very remote past. The thesis that a group of Martian giants perhaps es­ caped to earth to found the new culture of homo sapiens by breeding with the semi-intelligent beings living there then becomes a speculative poss ibility. Since the gravity of Mars is not as strong as that of the earth, it can be assumed that the build of Martian men was heavier and bigger than that of the earth men. If there is anything in this argu ment, we could have the giants who came from the stars, who could move enormous blocks of stone, who instructed men in arts still unknown on earth, and who finally died out. Never have we known so little about so much as today. I am certain that the theme Man and Unknown Intellig ences will remain on the agenda of research until every puzzle that can be solved has found an answer. 153"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"II The Search f or Direct Communication A T 4 o'clock one April morning in 1960, an experiment I\\.. began in a lonely valley in West Virgin ia. The big 85- foot radio-telescope at Green Bank was trained on the star Tau Ceti, 11.8 ligh t-years away. Young American astronomer Dr. Frank Drake, who enjoys considerable fame as a scien­ tist, acted as leader of this proj ect. He wanted to tune in to the radio transmi ssions of other civilizations in order to pick up signals from unknown intelligences in outer space. The first series of experi ments lasted 150 hours. They passed into history as Project Ozma (after the princess of the mythical land of Oz), although it was a failu re. The exper iment was broken off, not because some of the participating scientists expressed the view that there were no radio tra nsmissions in space, but rather because it was realized that at the time there was no apparatus sensitive enough to reach the desired goal . Ozma will not be the otdy experiment of its kind. Instru­ ments have been erected on the moon, as of July, 1969, and more are to come in subsequent visits by astro nauts. They 155"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"will be able to scan the immeasurable spaces between the stars for radio signals, free from terrestrial interference. However, it must be asked whether the search for radio signals really helps our space research and whether it might not be more practical for us to do the sending of radio signals into space. Of course, we cannot expect unknown intelligences to under stand Russian or Spanish or English and to be sit­ ting there waiting to be contacted. There remain three possibilities by which we can make our­ selves known : mathematical symbols, laser beams, and pic­ tures. The first of these seems most likely to succeed. In order to send such symbols we shall have to discover and fix intergalactic wavelengths that stand a good chance of be­ ing received · throug hout the cosmos . 1420 megaherz would provide such a frequency, for that is the radiation frequency of the neutral hydrogen that results from the collision of hy­ drogen atoms. Since hydrogen is an element, this radiation frequency could be known throug hout the univer se. Besides, 1420 megaherz lies outside the overcrowded scale of terres­ trial wavelengths. The poss ibility of errors and interference factors would be reduced to a minimum. In this way radio im­ pulses could be sent into space and if unknown intelligences­ exist they would recognize them. In this connection a news item from Die Zeit, December 22, 1967, is most interesting in the light of the actual moon landing in July, 1969. Under the headline \"The Moon Will Be Bombarded by Flashes,\" we read: The distance of the moon from the earth is known to the nearest few hundred yards, but astronomers refuse to be satis­ fied with that. So astronauts on one of the first Bights to the earth's satellite will take mirrors with them and set them up there. These mirrors-like the corner of a room- will consist of three reBecting planes standing at right angles to each other and will have the property of returning any light that strikes them back. to the source of the light. 156"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"This mirror system will be bombarded from the earth by a laser emitting flashes of light each lasting for a hundred mil­ lionth of a second. The laser will be used in conjunction with a telescope with an aperture of 1.50 meters. The light reflected from the moon will be picked up by this telescope and led to a photo-copier. The distance of the moon can then be determined to one and a half meters from the known speed of light and the time taken by a laser beam for the journey there and back. The same kind of thing is also conceivable in reverse. Radio waves have been travers ing the universe for a very long time. If my hypothesis is correct, isn't it credible that unknown intelligences are also announcing themselves to us? For ex­ ample, the radiation energy of CTA 102 suddenly increased in the autumn of 1964; Russian astronomers .informed the world that they had possibly received signals from an extra­ terrestrial superciviliza tion. (Radio star CTA 102 was listed under catalog number 102 by radio astronomers of the Cali­ fornia Institute of Technol ogy-h ence its name.) The astronomer Sholomitski said in the lecture room of the Sternberg Astrological Institute in Moscow on April 13, 1965: \"At the end of September and the beginning of Octo­ ber, 1964, the radiation energy from CTA 102 was much stronger, but only for a short time, then it diminished again. We registered this and waited. Toward the end of th,e year the intensity of the source suddenly increased again; it reached a second peak exactly 100 days after the first record was tak en.\" His chief, Professor I. S. Shklovskii, added that such ftuctuations in radiation were very unusual. Meanwhile Dut ch astrophys icist Maarten Schmidt has found out by exact measurements that CTA 102 must be about 10 billion ligh t-years from the ear th. That means that if the radio beams orig inated from intelligent beings, they must have been radiated 10 billion years ago. But accordi ng to the calc ulations of present-day research, our planet simply 157"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"did not exist at that time. This realization could mean a kind of coup de grace to the search for other living beings in the universe. But if the search for life in the universe had no chance of success, astrophysicists in America and Russia, at J odrell Bank, England, and at Stockert near Bonn in Germany would not be concentrating their research on what are known as radio stars and quasars with enormous directional antennae. The fixed stars Epsilon Eridiani and Tau Ceti are respectively 10.2 and 11.8 light-years away from us. So radio waves aimed at these \"neighbors\" would be about 11 ligh t-years under way, and an answer from them could reasonably reach us in 22 years . Radio communications with more distant stars would take correspondingly longer ; civilizations situated at distances reckoned in millons of light -years are quite un­ suitable to contact by means of radio waves. But are radio waves our only technical means of making such attempts? For example, we could also make ourselves optically no­ ticeable. A powerful laser beam directed at Mars or Jupiter could not remain unnoticed, prov ided that intelligent living beings are in existence there. (\"Laser\" is the abbreviation for \"light amplification by the stimulated emission of radiation .\") Another, somewhat fantas tic-sounding possibility would be to cultivate vast areas of soil so that tremendous color con­ trasts appeared which at the same time represented a geo­ metrical or mathematical symbol of universal validity. One audacious but perf ectly realizable idea : a gigantic equilate ral triangle would have its 600-mile-Iong sides sown with pota­ toes; in this enormous triangle a circle would be sown with wheat. In this way a vast yellow circle, surrounded by a green equilateral triangle, would appear every summer. Incident­ ally, a most useful and productive experiment I But if there are unknown intell igences that seek us as we seek them, the coloring of circle and triangle would be a hint to them that 158"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"these shapes were no freaks of nature. Someone has also ad­ vocated erecting a chain of lighthouses which radiate their lights vertically. The resultant sea of light should be arranged to have the shape of a model of an atom. There are all kinds of sugges tions based on the premise that someone somewhere is watching our planet. Are we tackl ing the problem the wrong way by limiting ourselves to the kind of means suggested above? However skeptical or antipathetic we may be to everyt hing occult, we cannot avoid looking into some as yet inexpli­ cable phys ical phenomena, for example the thought trans­ ference between intelligent brains that is proved on a broad scientific basis but not yet explained. In the parapsy chological departments of many important universities, previously unexplained phenomena such as clairvoyance, visions, and thought transference are being in­ vestigated with accurate scientific methods. In the process all ghos t and bogey stories from dubious occult sources or inspired by religious mania are separated and rejected. In this field of research, which was absolutely taboo until quite recently, we have made important advances. In August, 1959, the Nauti lus experiment came to an end. It not only demonstrated the poss ibility of thought transfer­ ence but also showed that mental communication between human brains can be stronger than radio waves. This was the experimen t: Thousands of miles away from the \"thought transmitter,\" the submarine Nautilus dived several hundred feet below the surfac e. All radio communications were interrupted, for even today radio waves do not penetrate to any apprecia ble depth. On the other hand, mental communication between Mr. X and Mr. Y did function. After such scientific tests one asks oneself what else the hu­ man brain is capable of. Can it make mental communications 159"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"faster than light? The Cayce affair, which has passed into the annals of scientific literature, stimulat es such supposi­ tions. Edgar Cayce, a simple farm er's son from Kentucky, had no idea of the fantastic capabilities that were hidden in his brain. Although he died on January 5, 1945, doctors and psy­ chologists are still busy evaluating his actions. The strict American Medical Association gave Edgar Cayce permission to hold consultations, although he was not a doctor. Edgar Cayce fell ill in his early youth; he was wracked by 'cramps; high fever was consuming his body; he fell into a coma. While the doctors were trying in vain to bring the boy back to consciousness, Edgar suddenly began to speak loudly and clearly. He explained why he was ill, named some remedies which he needed, and told them to prepare a paste from certain ingredients and smear his spine with it. Doctors and relatives were astounded because they had no idea where the boy had got this knowledge and the technical language, which was quite unknown to him. Edgar got pro­ gressively and visibly better after treatment with the medi­ cations he had named. The incident was the talk of the state. Since Edgar had spoken in a coma, many people sugges ted that he should be hypnotized in order to \"entice\" suggestions for cures from him. Edgar would not have this at any price. Not until a friend of his fell ill did he dictate a precise prescription using Latin words which he had never heard or even seen be­ fore. A week later his friend was better again. If the first case was soon forgo tten as a minor sensation that was not to be taken seriously scientifically, the second in­ cident caused the AMA to set up a commission which was to make reports if anything of the kind happened again and to put down in writing every single detail. In a sleeping state Cayce had knowledge and abilities which would nor­ mally be the result only of much consultation. 160"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"Once Cayce \"prescribed\" for a very wealthy patient a medicine that coul!i not be procured anywhere. This man put several advertisements in widely circulating newspapers, including international ones. A young doc tor wrote from Paris, saying that his father had made the medicine years ago but that production had long been discontinued. The compo­ sition of this me dicine was identical with the detailed ingre­ dients supplied by Edgar Cayce. Later Cayce \"prescribed\" a medicine and also named the address of a laboratory in a town a long way away. A tele­ phone call showed that the prepa ration was just being de­ veloped. A for mula had been worked out, they were look­ ing for a name, but it was not yet on sale to chemists. The profess ional doctors on the commission were no be­ lievers in telepat hy; they investigated soberly and · objec­ tively, verified what they observed, and knew that Cayce had never had a medical book in his hands in his life. Besieged on all sides and from all over the world, Cayce gave two con­ sultations a day, always in the pre sence of doctors and always without accepting fees. His diagnoses and therapeutical pre­ scriptions were accurate, but when he came out of his trance, he could not remember what he had said. Wht' .l\\ doctors on the commission asked him how he arrived at his diagnoses, Cayce supposed that he could put himself in contact with any brain required and gather the infor mation he needed for his diagnoses from it. But as the patient'S brain knew exactly what his body lacked, it was all very simple. He asked the brain of the sick person and then he sought out the brain in the world which could tell him what should be done. He him­ self, declared Cayce, was only a part of all brains. An astonishing idea, which-transferred to the realm of technol ogy-w ould look something like this. In N ew York a monster computer would be fed with all the known data on phy sics. Whenever and from wherever the computer was interrogated, it would give its answer in fractions of a sec- 161"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"ond. Another computer might be in Zurich with the whole of medical knowledge stored inside it. One in Moscow would be stuffed with all the facts about biology. Another in Cairo would have no gaps in its astronom ical knowledge. In short all the knowledge in the world, arranged by branches, would be stored in various centers. Connected by radio, the computer in Cairo, if asked for medical information, would pass on the questions to the computer in Zurich in a hun­ dredth of a second. Edgar Cayce's brain must have functioned in much the same way as this perfec tly credible and already technically feas ible computer linkup. I now put forward the bold speculation: What if all (or even only a few highly trained) human brains have unknown forms of energy at their disposal and possess the ability to make contact with all living beings? We know frighteningly little about the functions and potentialit ies of the human brain; but it is known that only one-tenth of the cortex func­ tions in the brain of a healthy man. What are the remaining nine -tenths doing? The fact that men have recovered from incurable diseases by willpower and nothing else is well known and scientifically documented. Perhaps a \"gear\" un­ known to us has been engaged, setting an additional tenth or two-tenths of the cortex working. If we assume the fantas tic idea that the strongest fonDS of energy operate in the brain, then a strong mental impulse would be noticeable everywhere simult aneously. If science succeeds in making such a \"wild\" idea demonstrable, it could mean that all intel­ ligences in the universe belong to the same unknown struc­ ture. Let me give an example. If a strong electrical impulse is released at any point in a tank full of millions of bacteria, it is felt everywhere and by every species of bacteria. The surge of current is perceived everyw here at the same mo­ ment. I quite realize that this comparison is imperfect, for electricity is a known form of energy and dependen t on 162"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"the speed of light. I am concerned with a form of energy that is available and effective every where simultaneously. I im­ agine an as yet unidentified form of energy which will one day make the incompreh ensible comprehensi ble. In order to give a semblance of probability to the ex­ traordinary idea, I shall quote the report of an experiment carri ed out May 29 and 30, 1965. In its scope and nature it must be unique. On these two days 1,008 people concentrated at the same time, indeed at the same second, on pictures, sentences, and groups of symbols, which were \"radiated\" into the univers e by them with concentrated power. The fact of this mass experiment is not the only astonishing thing-the results are strange, too. None of the participants knew any of the others ; they lived hundreds of miles apart. Yet 2.7 per­ cent of the particip ants answered on forms that they had seen a picture, namely the model of an atom. Since collusion on the part of the \"guinea pigs\" was impossible, it is sur­ prising that as many as 2.7 percent should have seen the same \"mental picture .\" Telepathy? Hocus-pocus? Chance? Admittedly, the whole thing is a science-fiction subject, but the experiment, organized by scientists, did take place. It is quite obvious that we don't know everything yet. The result of a experiment by a group of physicists at Princeton University is equally inexplicable. While investigating the disintegration of electrically neutral K mesons, they reached a result that was theoretically impossible because it contra­ dicted a long-es tablished principle of nuclear physics . One more extraordinary example. Einstein's theory of relativity says that mass and energy are only different forms of one and the same phenomenon (E = mc2) • Put simply, mass can literally be produced from the void. 1£ a strong beam of ener gy is shot past a heavy atomic nucleus, the beam of energy disappears into the strong electrical field of energy of the atomic nucleus and an electron and a posi­ tron appear in its place. Energy in the form of a beam has 163"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"changed into the mass of two electrons . To the mind that has not been trained scientifically the process seems crazy, and yet it takes place exactly like that. There is nothing to be ashamed of if you cannot follow Einstein; one scientist called him the great solitary because he could discuss his theory with only a dozen or so of his conte mporari es. After this excur sion into the still unexplored fields of thought transference and the functions of the human brain, let us tum back to our theme again . It is no longer a secret that in Novembe r, 1961, in the Na­ tional Radio Astronomy Observatory at Green Bank, West Virginia, eleven authorities met at a secre t conferen ce. Here, too, the theme of the conference was the question of the existence of extraterrestrial intelli gences . The scientists, among them Giuseppe Cocconi, Su Shu Huang, Philip Mor­ rison, Frank Drake, Otto Struve, and Carl Sagan, as well as the Nobel Prize winner Melvin Calvin, collaborated at the end of the conference on what is known as the Green Bank Formula. According to this formula there are at any moment in our galaxy alone 50,000,000 differen t civilizations which are either trying to get in touch with us or waiting for a sign from other planets. The terms of the Green Bank Formula take into account all the aspects in question, but in addi tion the scientists allotted two values to each term: a normal value admissible . according to our present state of knowledge and an absolute minimum value. In this formu la: � = the average annual number of new stars that are like our su n ; fp = the number of stars with possible living beings ; l1e = the average number of planets which orbit the eco- 164"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"sphere of their sun and so have adequate premises for the development of life by human standards; f l = the number of planets favored in this way on which life has actually develop ed; fl = the number of planets which are populated by intel­ ligences with their own ability to act during the life­ time of their sun; fa = the number of planets inhabited by intelligences that already have a developed technical civilization ; L = the life- span of a civilization, for only very long -last­ ing civilizations could encounter each other, given the vast distances in the universe . If we take the lowest poss ible figures for all t erms in this formula, we get: N = 40. But if we take the admissible maxi mum value, we get: N = 50,000,000. In other words, in the most unfavorable case the fantastic Green Bank For mula calculates that there are forty groups of intelligences in our Milky Way who are seeking contact with other intelligences. The most audacious possibility gives 50,000,000 unknown intelligences who are waiting for a sign from the cosmos. All the Green Bank calculations are based not on present as­ tronomical figures but on the number of stars in our Milky Way since it existed. If we accept the formula of this scientific brain trust, civ­ ilizations with more advanced technologies than ours may have existed hundreds of thousands of years ag o-a fact that supports the theory put forward here of visits by \"gods\" from the cosmos in the dawn of time. American astrobiologist Dr. Carl Sagan assures us that according to statistical calcu­ lations alone the poss ibility exists that our earth may have been visited by representatives of an extraterrestrial civiliza­ tion at least once in the course of its history. Fantasy and wishful thinking may be concealed ,in all the deliberations 165"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"and supposi tions, but the Green Bank Formula is a mathe­ matical formula and thus far removed from mere specula­ tion. A new branch of science is in the process of formation­ what is known as exobiology. New branches of science always find it difficult to achieve recogn itioll. Exobiology would certainly find it harder to find acceptance if recognized per­ sonal ities were not already devoting their work to this new field of research which tackles extraterrestrial life with complete impartiality. What better proof of the seriousness of this new science than a group of the names which subscribe to it: Dr. Freeman Quimby (chief of the NASA exobiological program), Ira Blei (NASA), Joshua Lederberg (NASA) , L.

Once landed on a planet, this light begins to emit beams and search for mole­ cules. Molecules are well-known prer equisite s for every kind of life. One of these molecules is the large spiral­ shaped DNS molecule, which consists of three chemical combinations arranged next to one another: nitrogen, sugar, and phosphoric acid. When the radiated light strikes such a molecule, the search beam is interrupted, because the ni­ trogen base aden in in chemical associ ation with sugar has an \"optically active\" effect. Since the sugar combination in the DNS molecule is \"optically active,\" the search beam of the probe has only to encounter a sugar -adenin combina­ tion to produce an immediate signal that, automatically sent to earth, would provide proof of life on an unknown planet. 167"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"The Mul tivator consists of a probe weighing barely 1 pound which is carried by a rocket as light baggage and ejected when near the planet. This miniature labo ratory is then in a posi­ tion to conduct as many as fifteen different experiments and tran smit their results to earth. The Radioisotope Biochemical Probe is the official name of a probe developed under the nickname Gulliver. It is intended to carry out a soft landing on the surface of another planet and immediately afterward to shoot out three 45-foot-Iong sticky ropes in various directions. In a few min­ utes these ropes will be automatically with drawn into the prob e; whatever stays clinging to the ropes-d ust, microbes, or any kind of biochemical subs tances -wi ll be immersed in a liquid culture medium. A part of this culture solution is enriched with the radioactive carbon isotope C-14; the micro­ organisms introduced would logically have to produce car­ bon dioxide, CO2, through their metabolism. The gas car­ bon dioxide can easily be separated from the liquid culture and led to a measuring apparatus which measures the radio­ activity of the gas containing C-14 nuclei and radios the results to earth. The Wolf Trap, a min i-laboratory, was originally called Bug Detector by its inventor, but his collabo rators rechris­ tened it because their chief is called Professor Wolf Vishniac. The Wolf Trap is also supposed to make a soft landing on an­ other planet and then extend a vacuum tube with a very fragile tip. When the tube touches the ground, the tip breaks and soil samples of all kinds will be sucked into the vacuum created. Once again the probe contains various sterile cultu re mediums which guaran tee every kind of bacteria a rapid growth. This mult iplication of the bacteria makes the liquid medium cloudy, and the pH value (the degree of acidity) of the liquid also changes. Both changes can be easily and accurately measured-the cloudiness of the liquid with the help of a beam of light and a photocell, the change in 168"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"the acid content by an electrical pH measurement.

Undoubtedly man will soon follow the min i-laborato­ ries which are the fore runners. The senior officials of NASA are unanimous in saying that the first astronauts will land on Mars by September 23, 1986, at the latest. This precise date has a reason. 1986 will be a year with little solar activity. Dr. Von Braun supports the view that men could land on Mars as early as 1982; NASA does not lack the technical re­ sources, only an adequate and unbroken financial grant from Cong ress. In addition to all the current American re­ spon sibili ties, two money swallowers such as the war in Viet­ nam and the space program are a heavy burden for even the richest nation in the world. The plan for travel to Mars exists. The Mars spaceship has been designed. It \"only\" needs to be built as well. A model of it stands on the desk of an unusual man in Hunts­ vill e-- Dr. Ernst Stuhlinger. Stuhl inger is director of the Research Proj ect Laboratory, which is part of the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center in Hu ntsville, Alabama. He employs more than 100 scientific collaborators in his labor­ atories .

Factories, rocket testing platforms, laboratories, giant hangars, and corrugated iron offices shot up from the ground breathtakingly fast in a few years. Today more than 150,000 people live in Huntsville; the little town has awakened from its sleep and its inhabitants have become enthusiastic space fans. When the first Redstone rockets thundered away from the testing platform , many Hun tsvillites ran down into their cellars in panic.

Dr. Donald Michie, who designed this computer, claimed that his machine was be­ ginning to develop a personal life. The new science is called futurology I It's goal is the plan­ ning and detailed investigation and understanding of the future by all the technical and mental · means availa ble. Think tanks are springing up all over the world; what they amount to are monasteries of scientist s of today, who are thinking for tomorrow. There are 164 of these think tanks at work in America alone. They accept commissions from the governmen t and heavy industry. The most celebrated 'think tank is the Rand Corporation at Santa Monica in Calif ornia. The U.S. Air Force was responsible for its founda­ tion in 1945. The reason? High-ranking officers wanted a re­ search program of their own on intercontinental warfare. Some 850 selected scientific authorities now work in the two­ story magnificently laid-out research center. The first ideas and plans for the foundations of mankind's most improbable adventures are born here. As early as 1946 Rand scientists evaluated the mili tary usefulness of a spaceship. When Rand developed the program for various satellit es in 1951, it was called Utopian. Since Rand has been functioning, the world 176"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"can thank this research center for 3,000 accurate accounts of hitherto unobserved phenomena. Rand scientists have pub­ lished more than 110 books, which have advanced our cul­ ture and civilization immeasurably. There is no end in sight to this research work, and there is unlikely to be one. Similar work for the future is being done in the follow­ ing institutes : The Hudson Institute at Harmon-on-Hud­ son, New York ; the Tempo Center for Advanced Studies be­ longing to General Electric at Santa Barbara, Califor nia; the Arthur Little Institute at Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the Battelle Institute at Columbus, Ohio. Governments and big business simply cannot manage with­ out these thinkers for the future. Governments have to de­ cide on their military plans far in adva nce ; big businesses have to calculate their investments for decades ahead. Fu­ turology will have to plan the development of capital cit­ ies for a hundred or more years ahead. Equipped with present-day knowledge, it would not be difficult to estimate, say, the development of Mexico for the next fifty years. In making such a forecast, every con­ ceivable fact would be taken into account, such as the exist­ ing technology, means of communication and transport, polit­ ical currents, and Mexico's potential opponents. If this fore­ cast is possible today, unknown intelligences could certainly have made such a forecast for the planet Earth 10,000 years ago. Mankind has a compulsive urge to think out in advance and investigate the future with all the potentialities at its command. Without this study of the future, we would prob­ ably have no chance of unraveling our past. For who knows whether important clues for the unraveling of our past do not lie around the archaeological sites, whether we do not trample them heedlessly under foot because we do not know what to make of them. 177"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"That is the very reason why I advocated a \"Ut opian ar­ chaeological year.\" In the same way that I am unable to \"believe\" in the wisdom of the old patterns of thought, I do not ask others to \"believe\" my hypothesis. Nevertheless, I expect and hope that the time will soon be ripe to attack the riddle of the past without prejudice-making full use of all the refinements of technology. It is not our fault that there are millions of other planets in the universe. It is not our fault that the Japanese statue of Toko mai, which is many thousands of years old, has modern fas­ tenings and eye apertures on its helmet. It is not our fault that the stone relief from Palenque exists. It is not our fault that Admiral Piri Reis did not bum his ancient maps. It is not our fault that the old books and traditions of hu­ man history exhibit so many absurdities. But is our fault if we know all this but disregard it and refuse to take it seriously. Man has a mag nificent future ahead of him, a future which will far surpass his magnificent past. We need space research and research into the future and the cour age to tackle projects that now seem impossibl e. For exam ple, the project of concerted research into the past which can bring us valuable memories of the future. Memories which will then be proved and which will illuminate the history of man­ kin d-for the blessing of future generations . 178"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Biblio graphy A LLE N , T., The Quest, Philadel phia, Chilton Books, 1965.

He is an aut odi­ dact, which the dictionary defines as a man who is self­ taught. Probably this helps explain the success his first book met with all over the world. Completely free from all prej udices, he had to demonstrate personally that his theses and theories were not unfounded and hundreds of thousands of readers were able to follow him along the adv enturous road he took-a road that led into regions that were sur rounded and protected by taboos. Besides, his fearless questioning of all the previous ex­ planations of the origin of the human race seems to have been long over due . Erich von Daniken was not the first man who dared to challenge them, but his questions were more impartial, more direct and more audacious. In addi­ tion, he was able to say exactly what he wanted to say, un­ like a professor, for exam ple, who would have felt bound to take the opinions of his colleagues or the representa­ tives of similar academic disciplines into considera tion. What is more, he came up with some startling answers. Men who bluntly ask bold questions that cast doubt on time-honored, accepted explanations have always been a nuisance and people have never been over-fussy about how they silenced them.

Yet none of these methods has ever succeeded in disposing of questions which concern the reason for our very existence. Erich von Daniken has the spontaneity of the enthusi­ ast. In the summer of 1 968 he read articles by Vlatcheslav Saizev in the Soviet jour nal Sputnik with titles such as \"Sp aceship in the Himalayas\" and \"An gels in Spacesh ips.\" Von Daniken booked a flight to Mo scow on the spot. There Professor Shklovsky, director of the Radio Astro­ nomic Department of the Soviet Academy of Science's Sternberg Institute, answered his questions. The author of Ch ariots of the Gods? was barely nine­ teen years old when his curiosity first drove him to Egypt where he hoped to track down the real meaning of some cuneif orm inscriptions. Since his first journey in 1 95 4, he hops on planes to clear up his theories the way we catch a bus. Thinking on the space scale as he does, dist ance means nothing to him so long as the goal of his jour neys provides arguments for the impossible. WILHELM ROGGERSDORF 188"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"Foreword THE desire for peace, the search for immortality, hanker­ ing for the stars- all these are deeply rooted in the human consciousness and have been ceaselessly pressing for real­ ization from time immemorial. Is this urge for realization that is so deeply implanted in human beings something to be taken for granted? Is it really only a question of human desires? Or does this striving for fulfillment, this nostalgia for the stars, conceal something quite different? I am convinced that our longing for the stars is kept alive by a legacy bequeathed by the \"go ds.\" Me mories of our terrestrial ancest.ors and memories of our cosmic teachers are both at work in us. Man's acquisiti on of in­ tell igence does not seem to me to have been the product of a long and tedious developm ent. The process took place too suddenly for that. I think that our ancest ors received their intell igence from the \"gods ,\" who must have pos­ sessed knowledge that made the whole process a rapid one.

For the heart of the matter, I am convinced, lies in the important questions of when and how our ancest ors became intelligent. This book is an attempt to provide new arguments for my theory. It is meant to be another peaceful incenti ve to reflection about the past and future of mankind. For too long we have failed to investigate our remote past with daring and imagination. It will not be possible to produce the last conclusive proofs in one generation, but the walls which still separate fantasy from reality will have more and more breaches in them. I shall try to do my best to keep on breaking through them with new aggre ssive questions. Perhaps I shall be lucky. Perhaps questions of the kind that are also asked by Louis Pauwels, Jacques Bergier, and Robert Charroux will be answered in my lifetime. I should like to thank the countless readers of my Ch ario ts of the God s? for their letters and suggestions. I want them to accept this book as the response to their encourag ement.

Even during the 1940 ' S when the first rockets had already been launched from the earth 's sur­ face and flown hundreds of miles, doctors insisted that any kind of manned space travel was impossible because the human metabolism would be unable to stand the condi· tion of weightlessness for several days on end. Yet mankind has not died out and rockets are a familiar sight, and con trary to all predictions the human metab­ olism can obviously stand the condition of weightless­ ness. What I am saying is that at some time or other the technical feasibility of every new idea vitally affecting the life of mankind was not prove n. Proof of its prac ticability was always preceded by the speculation of the so-called visionaries who were violently attacked or, what is often harder to stomach, laughed at condescendin gly by their contemporaries. I admit quite frankly that in this sense I am a visi onary, too, but I do not live in splendid isolation with my specu­ lations. My conviction that intell igences from other plan­ ets have visit ed the earth in the remote past is already under serious consideration by many scientists in both East and West. For example, Professor Charles Hapgood told me dur­ ing my stay in the Un ited States that Albert Einstein, whom he had known personally, was in complete sym­ pathy with the idea of a prehistoric visit by extraterrestrial intelli gences.

And I am convinced that with every rocket that shoots into the universe, the traditional opposition to my theory about the \"gods\" will get weaker and weaker. Only ten years ago it was absurd to talk about the ex­ istence of another form of intelligent life in the universe. Today no one seriously doubts that extraterrestrial life exists in the cosmos. When eleven scientific experts sep­ arated after a secret conference in Green Bank, West Vir­ ginia, in 1 9 61, they had agreed on a formula which calcu­ lated up to 5 0,000,000 civili zations in our galaxy alone. Roger A. MacGowan, who holds an important NA SA appointment in Redsto ne, Alabama, even arrives at a figure of 1 3 0 billion possible cultures in the cosmos, bas­ ing his theory on the most recent developments in as­ tronomy. These estimates seem comparatively modest and cau­ tious if it proves to be true that the key of life-i.e., the generation of all life from the four bases adenine, cyto sine, guanine and thymine ---c ontrols the whole cosmos. If this is the case, the universe must be literally teeming with life.

Like a conjurer, they whip out of the hat the state­ ment that because interstellar space travel will never be possible in the future, our earth cannot have been visited in the past by unknown intelli gences because they would have had to have been able to traverse interstellar space. And that's that! But why should not interstellar space travel be possible? Working on the speeds that seem possible to us today, it is calculated that the jour ney to our nearest fixed star Alpha Centauri, which is 4.3 light years away, would take 80 years-in other words no man could survive the flight there and back. Is this calculation correct? Admittedly, the average expectation of life today is about 7 0 years. The training of space pilots is complicated; even the most intelligent young man would not be able to pass his ex­ amina tions as an astronaut before he was twenty. And if he were over sixty, he would hardly be sent on a space mission. That leaves only 40 years as an active astrona ut. It sounds quite logical to say that 40 years is not long enough for an interstellar expedition. But that is a fallacy. Even a simple example shows why and simult aneously demonstrates how hard it is for us to escape from trad itional patterns of thought whenever we tackle proj ects for the future. Let us suppose that I am given an accurate calculation showing that it is impossible for a water bacteria to move from point A to point B dur­ ing its life-span because the microbe can only move at speed x and neither the current nor the slope of the water­ course can increase the speed x by more than y per cent at most. That sounds convincin g, but there is a mental error in the calculation. The water bacteria can move from A to B in many different ways. For example, we can freeze it. Then the ice cube conta ining the bacteria travels from A to B in an aircraft. The ice is melted and the microbe has reached its goal.

But it seems to me a perfectly feasible, indeed highly practical, method of transporting the mi­ crobe -j ust as I think (which is why I gave this example) that we have reached the stage when we must replace obsolete methods by new ones. In spite of all the objections to it, there is nothing far­ fetched about my fore cast that in the not too distant fu­ ture it will be possible to freeze astr onauts, thaw them out aga in on a set date, and restore the use of their functions. Professor Alan Sterling Parkes, member of the Nati onal Institute for Medical Research in London , supports the view that by the early 1970's medical science will already have perfected a method of preserving orga ns for trans­ plants indefinit ely at low temperatures. Anyway, the whole has always been equal to the sum of its parts, which is why I am convinc ed that my forecast is right. In all experiments on animals, one problem that con­ stantly recurs is how to keep the brain cells alive, since they die rapidly without oxyge n. The fact that research teams of the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Air Force, as well as finns such as General Electric and the Rand Corpo ration, are working full time on it shows how seriously the solution of this problem is taken. The first reports of succesS come from the Western Reserve School of Medicine in Cleve­ land, Ohio, where the brains of five rhesus monkeys were separated from their bodies and kept functioning for as much as eighteen hours. The separated brains reacted unhesitatingly to noises. These experiments are basically connected with the idea of con structing a \"cyborg\" (the abbreviation of \"cyber­ netic org anism\") . In a speech the German physicist and cyber neticist Herbert W. Franke put forward the sensa­ tional idea that in the decades to come spaceships would journey to unknown planets without astronauts aboard and search the universe for extraterrestrial intelli gences. 1 97"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"Space patrols without astronauts? Franke assumes that the electronic equipment would be operated by a brain sep­ arated from a human body. This \"solo\" brain, kept in a liquid culture medium which would have to be constantly replen ished with fresh blood, would be the control center of the spaceship. Franke thinks that the brain of an un­ born child would be the most suitable for progra mming because, not being bur dened with mental proce sses, it could be fed with the data and information necessary for the special tasks of space travel. This programmed brain would lack the consciousness that makes normal brains \"huma n.\" Herbert W. Franke says : \"Sti mulations, as we know them, would be alien to the cyborg. It would have no feelings. The human solo brain is promoted to ambas­ sador of our planet. \" Roger A. Ma cGowan also predicts a cyborg, half living being, half machine. In the view of this scientific aut hority the cyborg will ultimately reach the stage of a completely electronic being, whose functions are progra mmed in a solo brain and translated into orders by the latter. The Frankfurt Jesuit Paul Overhage, who enjoys con­ siderable fame as a biologist, said about this fantastic proj ect for the future : \"Its realization can scarcely be doubted because the rapid progress of biotechnolo gy is consta ntly making it easier to carry out experiments of this kin d.\" During the last two decades molecular biology and biochemist ry have advanced very rapidly and achieved results which have completely chang ed a great deal of medical science and practice. The ability to slow down the process of aging or even interrupt it completely lies within our grasp, and even the fantastic construction of a cyborg has already been removed from the realm of pure imagination. Naturally these projects create moral and ethi cal prob­ lems which will perhaps be harder to solve than the actual 1 9 8"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"medicotechnical problems. But all this will fade into in­ significance if we keep our eye on the other highly prob­ able possibility that one day spaceships will reach such incredible speeds that they can traverse cosmic distances even within the normal life-span of astr onauts. The explanation of this technical phenomenon lies in the time dilation effect, which is already an accepted scientific fact. We must realize that \"terrestrial years\" are quit e irrele­ vant as far as passeng ers on an interstellar space journ ey are concerned. In a spaceship trave ling just below the speed of light, time creeps by slowly in comparison wit h the time that rushes along on the launching planet. This can be accurately calculat ed by mathematical form ulae. Incredible as it may seem, we do not have to take these calculations on trust; they have been proved. We must free ourselves from our conception of time, i.e., terrestrial time. Time can be manipul ated by speed and energy. Our space-trav eling grandchildren will break the time barriers. Those who doubt the technical possibility of interstel­ lar space travel adduce an argument that deserves close examination. They say that even if rocket propulsion units were ultimately built to reach a speed of 9 3,000 miles per second or more, interstellar space travel would still be impossible because at such a speed the minut est cosmic particles that struck the exterior of the spaceship would have the destructive and penetrative power of a bomb. Un doubtedly that object ion cannot be rejected lightly, but how long will it be valid? Scientists in the Un ited States and the Soviet Uni on are already engaged in the development of electromagnetic safety rings to divert the dangerous particles floating in space away from space­ ships. These research projects have already met with some success. The skeptics also say that a speed of more than 186,000· 199"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"miles per second is just a utopian dream because Einstein has proved that the speed of light is the absolute limit of velocity. Even this count erargu ment is only valid if one starts from the premise that spaceships of the future will have to be launched with the ener gy of milli ons of gallons of fuel and carried into the universe with the same source of energy. Today radar sets operate with waves traveling at 186,000 miles per second. But, the reader will ask me, what connection have waves with the propulsion of space­ ships of the future? In their book The Pl anet of Imposs ibl e Pos sib iliti es, the two Frenchmen Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier describe the fantastic project of the Soviet scientist K. P. Stanyukovich, who is a member of the Commission for Interplanet ary Commun ications of the U .S.S.R.' s Acad­ emy of Sciences. Stanyuk ovich plans a space sonde which will be propelled by antimatter. Since a sonde travels faster the faster the particles on board it are emitted, the Mo scow professor and his team hit upon the idea of con­ structing a flying lamp that worked by the emission of light instead of red-hot gases. The speeds that can be reached in this way are enormous. As Bergier tells us: \"The passengers in such a flying lamp would not notice anything unusual.

Even in my wildest flights of fancy I cannot imagine the consequences of a development that is brewing in the dark mists of the future. In 1 9 67, Gerald Feinberg, pro­ fessor of theore tical physic .s at Columbia University in New York, published his theory of tachyons in the scien­ tific journal Physical Review (\"tachyo n\" comes from the Greek word tachys, or \"fast\") . His article was not just the ravings of a visionary ; it described a piece of serious scien­ tific resear ch. A course of lectur es on it has already been given at the Eidgenossischen Technischen Hochschule in Zurich. The following is a brief descr iption of the tachyon theory. According to Einstein's theory of relativity, the mass of a body grows in relation to the increase in its veloc ity. A mass ( = energy) that reached the speed of light would be infinitely large. Feinbe rg supplied mathe­ matical proof that there was a counterpart to Einsteinian mass, namely particles that move infinitely fast, but be­ come slower when they approach the speed of light. Ac­ cording to Feinberg, tachyons are a billion times faster than light, yet they cease to exist when they are reduced to the speed of light or below it. Just as the theory of relativity (without which present­ day physics and mathematics simply could not function) had only a mathematical proof for decades, tachyons are not yet demonstrable experimen tally, but only mathemat­ ically. However, Feinb erg is working on an experimental proof. Believing in the future as I do, my fantasy runs � way with me when I hear about research of this kind. Time and again during the last hundred years we have ulti­ mately lived to see things that were considered impossible in the form of industrially manuf actur ed products. So on 201"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"this occasion I think I am entitled to enlarge upon an idea that, as I have said, is still in its infancy. What might happen in the future? If it became possible to capture tachyons or produce them artificially, they could also be transformed i nto the propulsive energy for space sondes. Then, I assume, a spaceship would be brought up to the speed of light using a photon propulsion unit. As soon as it was reached, a computer would automatically switch on the tachyon pro­ pulsion unit. How fast would the spaceship travel then? A hundred, a thousand times faster than light? No one knows the answer today. Scientists suspect that once past the speed of light, so-called Einsteinian space would be left behind and the spaceship hurled into an as yet un­ defined, superim posed space. But at this vital moment in the history of space travel the time factor would become almost meaningless. I know of many fields of research in which the work going on is mainly devoted to the service of interstellar space travel. I have been in many laboratories and talked to many scientists. No one knows how many physicists, chemists, biologists, atomic physicists, parapsychologists, geneticists, and engineers are working on the project that will enable man to fly back to the world of the stars-they are often lump ed together, somewhat inaccurately, under the generic name of futur ological projects. It seems to me to be an under-evaluation of the human potential if, under the pressure of proof provided by tech­ nological advances, people admit the possibility of investi­ gating cosmic space at some future date, but obstinately deny that the universe may contain intelli gences who knew all about interstellar space travel thousands of years before we did and so could have visited our planet.

I put forward the spec­ ulative idea that \"God\" had created man in hi s own ima ge by means of an artificial mutation. I voiced the suspicion that Homo sapiens became separated from the ape tribe by a deliberately planned mutation. I have been attacked for making this assertion. Because the tracing back of the origin and development of man has so far been limited entirely to our planet, my theory that extraterrestrial beings could have had a hand in the process is a bold one. Yet if this idea was considered within the bounds of possibility, our beautiful family tree -apes scrambled down from the trees, mutated, and be­ came the ancestors of man-would be destroyed. Since Charles Darwin (180 9 -82) put forward his theory of natural selection, all fossil finds, from the skeletons of primitive apes up to Homo sap iens, have seemed to be convincing arguments in favor of his theory. When the teacher Johann Carl Fuhlrott (18° 4 -8 7 ) discovered some old bones in the Neanderthal near Dusseldorf and used them to reconstruct Neanderthal man, who lived in the last interglacial age and at the beginning of the Wurm glaciation, i.e., from about 120,000 to 80,000 years ago, he built up his theory of ape-men on the basis of this find. 20 4"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"It caused quite a stir in scholarly circles. Disconcerted re­ ligious opponents of Fuhlrott's theory put forward the rather unconvincing argument that there could not be a fossil man because fossil men ought not to exist. There are many other species in addition to Neander­ thal man. The lower jaw of a kind of primate was found at EI Fayum, near Cairo. It was dated to the Oligocene Age, which was between thirty and forty million years ago. If that dating is corre ct, it would be proof that be­ ings resem bling man must have existed long before Nean­ derthal man. Fossil examples of hominids have also been found in England, Africa, Australia, Borneo and else\" where . What do these finds prove? They prove that we cannot say anything definite be­ cause nearly every new find throws doubt on the datings that have just been included in our textbooks. In spite of the large number of finds, it is fair to say that they give very inadequate clues to the historical continuity of the origin and development of the human race. Certainly the track of racial development from homini ds to Homo sap iens can be followed back clearly for millions of years, but we cannot make nearly so definite a statement about the origin of inte llig ence. There are minimal indications from the remote past, but they do not add up to a whole. So far I have not been fortunate enough to hear an expla­ nation of the origin of intelli gence in man that is even tolerably convincing. There is a vast number of specula­ tions and theories about how this miracle is supposed to have happened. That is why I believe that my theory is equally entitled to a hearing. In the course of the thousands of millions of years of general evolution, human intelli gence seems to have ap­ peared almost overnight. If we reckon in millions of years, we can say that this event must have taken place suddenly.

But intelli gence must have made a sudden appearance for this to happen . Several million years passed before anthro­ poids came into being through natural mutations, but after that the hominids underwent a lightnin glike devel­ opment. All of a sudden, tremendous advances appear about 4 0,000 years ago. The club was discovered as a weapon; the bow was invent ed for hunting; fire was used to serve man's own ends; stone wedges were used as tools; the first painti ngs appeared on the walls of caves. Yet 500, 000 years lie between the first signs of a technical activity, pottery, and the first finds in hominids' settle­ ments. Loren Eiseley, professor of anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania, writes that man emerged from the animal world over a period of millions of years and only slowly assumed human features. \"But,\" he goes on, \"there is one exception to this rule. To all appearances his brain ultimately underwent a rapid development and it was only then that man finally became distinguis hed from his other relative s.\" Who was it that taught us to think? Although I have great respect for the hard work done by anthr opologists, I must frankly admit that I am not really interested in the prehistoric age that the eyeteeth of anthropoids or homini ds can be proved to belong to by fossil finds. Nor do I think the date when the first Homo sap iens used stone tools very important. To me it is as obvious that primiti ve man was the most intell igent being on our planet as it is logical that the gods chose thi s part icul ar be ing for an artificial mutation. I am far more interested in when primi tive man first introduced moral values such as loyalty, love, and friendship into his com­ muniti es.

Why did the anthropoids suddenly begin to bury their fellows when they had only just ou tgrown an animal ex­ istence? Who taught the savages to take the seeds of certain wi ld plants, pound them up, add water, and bake an article of food from the resulting mush? Why anthropoids, hom in ids and primiti ve men learned nothing for milli ons of years and then suddenly primitive men learned so much is a question that nags at me. Has too little attention been paid to this important question up to the present? The field of research devoted to the explanation of the origin of mankind is interesting and very worthwhile. Yet the question why, how, and from what date man became intelli gent seems to me to be at least as interest­ mg.

Today we know that this did happen. Modern research assumes that the first life on earth originat ed one and a half billion years ago. Prof essor Hans Vogel writes: \"In those days the barren land and the vast primordial ocean were enveloped in an atmos phere that was still without oxyg en. lVl ethane, hydrog en, ammonia, steam, and perhaps acetylene and cyanide of hydrogen as well, formed a covering around the earth, which was still devoid of life.

So that the experiment might take place in sterile conditions, he had the Miller apparatus, as it is now known in scientific literature, heated to a temperature of 180° C for eighteen hours. In the upper half of the glass sphere he fixed two electrodes, between which electrical discharges were constantly fly­ ing. In this way , using a high frequency current of 60,000 volts, a per manent mini ature storm was produced in the primitive atmosphere. In a smaller glass sphere, sterile water was heated and its steam was conducted via a tube to the large sphere containing the primiti ve atmosphere. T h e cooled-off matter flowed back into the sphere con­ taining sterile water, to be reheated there and so climb up again to the sphere containing the primiti ve atmo­ sphere.

Ever since man has been able to think, he has tried to evaluate everyth ing around him in terms of polarity : light versus dark, heat versus cold, life against death.

But just as there are many intermediate stages between all extreme designa­ tions, it has long been impossible to draw a rigid boun dary line between org anic and inorg anic chemistry. When our planet began to cool off, what we call the primitive atmosph ere was formed from the light matter whose gas molecules were swirling about in confusion. It consisted mainly of those ingredients from which Miller brewed up his prim itive soup in his laboratory experi­ ments. Owing to the original high temperatures of the earth and its weak gravity, light gases such as helium and free hydrogen were lost in the cosmos, while the heavy gas molecules such as nitrog en, oxyg en, carbon dioxide and also the heavier \"noble\" gas atoms were reta ined. Hydro­ gen in its free state, its element ary form, is now virtually nonexistent in our atmosphere ; it is only found in chemi­ cal combinations. For example, two atoms of hydrogen together with one atom of oxygen form a molecule of the essential compound water (chemical symb ol: H20) . The cycle got under way . Water evaporated and rose with the warm radiation from the earth in clouds of vapor which cooled off at great heights and poured down as rain. This primitive rain freed many kinds of inorganic matt er from the hot stone crust and swe .pt them into the ocean. Inorganic compounds such as ammonia and cyanide of hydrogen from the atmosphe re also dissolved in the primitive ocean and took pal't in chemk al reactio ns.

Today science is unanimous in saying that the transforma tion of the origi­ nal atmo sphere into our oxidizing atmos phere took about 1.2 billi on years. At the beginning of this development was the primitive soup, which, with its numerous forms of matter in solution, was a first-class cultur e medium for the first primiti ve forms of life. It is said that life is always connected with an org anism, in the simplest case with the org anism's cell. The fact that an org anism lives is proved by its metabolism, and also shows in its dev elopment. Functions constitute life. Are all these currently accepted criteria necessarily correct? If they are, a virus does not live. A virus itself und ergoes no chang e of matter and energy ; it does not eat nor does it excrete. It only multi plies inside fore ign cells by repro­ duction. It is a parasite. What then is life? Shall we ever be able to define it? If we follow the path of the origin of life in its main stages, the vital question is: Whence the first living cell? Theodor Schwann ( 18 10- 82) and Matt hias Schleiden (1804-8 1) carried out the fundamental research. Schwann proved that animals and plants are made up of cells; Schleiden recognized the importance of the nucleus. Then the Augustine prior Gregor Johann Mendel (18 2 2-84) , who taught natural histo ry and physics at Brun, ma d e his crossbreeding exper iments with peas and beans. This progressive priest discovered three laws of hered­ ity with his patient experiments and became the founder of the science of hered ity. Today his laws are unanimously accepted as gover ning men, animals and plants. About the middle of the nin eteen'th centur y it was proved that the cell is the carrier of all vital functions. This proof became the basis for all the big biological dis­ coveries. Now new techniques (roentgenology, electro- 212"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"phor esis, ultrami croscopy, phase-contrast microscopy, etc.) enable us to examine cells and nuclei. We suspect that the information centers for the storing and transmissi on of hereditary factors are in the cells and the nuclei. Research in this field, which is still comparatively re­ cent, found out that every org anism has a specific number of chromosomes which have their own specific shape. Chromosomes a r e the carriers of hereditary factors. For example, the cells of the human body have 2 3 pairs of chromosomes = 4 6 chromosomes, a bee's cells have 8 pairs = 16 chromosomes, a sheep's cells 27 pairs = 5 4 chromosomes. ' The protein molecules of the cells consist of chains of amino acids. Given this piece of scientific infonnation, we were faced with the new question of how living cells originated from amino acids. In connection with the only partially solved problem of how protein could come into being before there were living cells, Ru therford Platt describes the theory held by Dr. George Wald of Harvard Un ivers ity. Wald as­ sumed that under certain natural conditions amino acids must give the answer. Dr. S. W. Fox of the Institut e for Molecular Evolution, Miami, tested this idea by drying out solutions of amino acids. Fox and his collaborators observed that the amino acids formed long threadlike submic roscopic structures. They had formed chain com­ pounds containing hund reds of amino molecules. Dr. Fox called them protenoids, i.e.� prot einlike matter. Following the investigations of Professors J. Oro and A. P. Kimball, the chemists Dr. Ma tthews and Dr. Mo ser succeeded in producing protein matter from poisonous prussic acid and water in 1 9 61.

After our brief canter through chemist ry and biolo gy, the main thing for the reader to have grasped is that the construction of a living org anism is a chemical process. Life can be produced in laboratories. But what connec­ tion have nucleic acids with life? Nu cleic acids determine the compl icated process of heredity. The sequence of four bases -a denine, guanine, cytosine and thymi ne-gives the genetic code for all forms of life. Once this dis covery was made, chemi stry was able to remove a great deal of the mystery surrounding life. There are two groups of nucleic acids whose names have become famili ar to every assiduous newspaper reader: RNA (ribosenucleic acid) and DNA (deoxyri­ senudeic acid) . Both RNA and DNA are necessary for the synthesis of protein in the cells. It is a fact that the proteins of all organisms examined so far are built up of about twenty amino acids and that the sequence, or ar­ rangement, of amino acids in a protein molecule is determined by the sequence of the four bases in the DNA , or the genetic code . But even if we know the structure of the genetic code, we are still a long way from being able to read the infor­ mation stored in a chromosome. Nevertheless, the thought that twenty amino acids are the bearers of all life and that their arrang ement in protein molecules is laid down in the genetic code is earthshaking. In his book The Bi o­ logical Time Bomb George Ratt ray Taylor quotes the views of the No bel Prize winners Dr. Max Perutz and Professor Marshall W. Nierenberg on the tremendous possibilities that lie ahead. Dr. Max Perutz says : \"Th ere are about one hundred million pairs of nucleotide bases distributed among forty­ six chromosomes in a single human cell. How could we erase a specific gene from one particular chromosome, or 21 4"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"add one to it, or repair a single pair of nucl eotides? It hardly seems practicable to me.\" Professor Marshall W. Nierenberg, who played a vital role in the discovery of the genetic code, has a quite dif­ fere nt opinion : \"I have no doubt that the difficulties can be overcome one day. The only question is when. I imag­ ine that we shall succeed in progra mming cells with syn­ thetic genetic information within the next twenty-five year s.\" Lastly, Joshua Lederberg, professor of genetics at Stan­ ford Uni versity in California, is convinced that we shall be able to manipulate all our hereditary factors within the next ten or twenty years. At all events, we have now realized that an insi ght into hereditary factors and their transformation is possible. And since we human beings know this, there is really no reason why an extraterrestrial intelli gence that is familiar with space travel and conseq uently thousands of years ahead of us scientifically should not know it too. In their book You Will Li ve to See It, the physicist and mathematician Herman Kahn, director of the Hu dson Institut e of New York, and Ant hony J. Wiener, adviser to the Am erican gover nment and also a member of the Hudson Institute, quote the Washington Post of October 3 I, 1 9 66, which described the possible results of manipu­ lating the genetic code: Within ten or fif teen years a housewife will be able to go into a special store, look through a selection of packets like seed packets and choose her child by the label. Each packet will contain a one-day-old frozen embryo and on the label the buyer will be able to read the color of hair and eyes, the size of body and IQ she can expect. There will also be a guarant ee that the embryo has no heredi tary defects. The woman will take the embryo of her choice to her doctor and have him implant it.

Parasites that they are, they bull ied the host cells into prod ucing milli ons of new viruses following the pattern of Phi X 174.

According to my specu lations, this could only have taken place by an artificial mutation of primitive man's genetic code by unknown intelli gences.

And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones [I], and flesh of my flesh [I]: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of a Man. It is qu ite possible that woman was created from man, but Eve can hardly have blossomed forth in her naked beauty from the narrow rib of the male thorax by a con­ juring trick-after a surgical intervention? Perhaps she originated with the help of a male sperm cell. But as accord ing to the biblical Genesis, there was no female human being in Paradise who could have received the seed, Eve must have been produced in a retort. Now a number of cave drawings showing objects like retorts in the vicin ity of primiti ve man have been preserved. Could fore ign intelli gences with a highly developed science and knowing about the immune biological reactions of bones have used Adam's marrow as a cell culture and brought the sperm to deve lopment in it? The comparatively easily accessible human rib would obviously have been the most suitable container for this biologically possible act of crea tion. That is a speculation, but one that is practicable in the present state of scientific knowledge. As Eve was allotted as Adam 's mat e very suddenly in the Bible, there should have been a sudden spate of draw­ ings of female bei ngs on cave walls or Stone Age bones following the artificial creation of woman I have de­ scribed .

It is conceivable that Homo sap iens originated in diff erent parts of the world in two diff erent ways: by the planned mut ation of the genetic code of hominids and by the artificial production of a female be­ ing and her cultivation in a retort. Nevertheless, the new men later mated with animals again. These lapses must be attributed to the old Adam because he alone remembered coupling with apelike ani­ mals. After the artificial mu tation it should have been natural for the new human bei ngs to mate with each other . Hen ceforth every reversion to the former habit of mating with animals that led to repro duction was a step backward. Can this backsliding have been the Fall of Man? And was it at the same time original sin against the building up of the new kind of cells? A few thousand years later, the \"gods\" corrected this Fall. (I shall have more to say about this.) They destroyed the hybrid animal-men, separated a well-p reserved group of new men, and implant ed new genetic material in them by a second artificial mutation. Palaeoanth ropologists are puzzled by the sudden, breathtakingly fast separation of the nean thropids, the group of Homo sap iens to which we belong, from the family of prehom inids, who were still apelike in form. So far the process has been prov isionally explained by -a spon­ taneous mutation. If we adopt the preanthropological datings marking the 220"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"essential changes in our first ancest ors for our theory of a planned artificial mutation by unknown intelli gences, then the first artificial mutation with the genetic code used by the \"gods\" must have taken place between 40,000 and 20,000 B.C. And the second artificial mut ation would have occurred in more recent times, between 7 ,000 and 3,500 B.C. Assuming these datin gs are correct, the \"gods' \" first visit would probably have taken place in the age which yielded the first drawings and figurines of women. Anthropological scholars shy away from datings that go so far back. But surely the time dilation effect, which is unreservedly accepted by science, must have been valid in all ages. Time dilation is a known quan tity for all planned inter­ stellar space travel pro jects, both now and in the future. The fact that it was gov erned by a law was first dis­ covered in our own day, but just because it is governed by a law it obviously held good at all times, and would have appl ied to the \"gods\" who could have visited the earth in their spaceships trav eling just below the speed of light. Surely the time has come for anthropologists to take this scientifically verified phenomenon into accou nt. If they did. many of the questions about how our fore­ fathers origina ted and became intelli gent would be an­ swered instantaneously. No eternities have passed for the \"gods\" since their visit to earth ! If they had paid a visit to our planet thousands of terres trial years ago, only a few decades would have passed for the crew of the space ship. Anyone who accepts time dilation as applying to the visit of the unknown astronauts will und erstand at once that the same \"gods\" who developed woman from Homo sapiens could also have given Mo ses the highly technical instructions for building the Ark of the Cov enant. 221"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"I know that it is difficult to grasp and yet it could be true.

The Research Instit ute for Elect roac oustics in Mar­ seilles moved into a new building in the spring of 1 9 64. A few days after the move, several of Professor Vladimir Gavre au's fellow workers began to complain of headaches, nausea and itching. Some of them were so badly affected that they trembled like aspen leaves. In an institute de­ voted to elec troacou stical problems it seemed likely that some uncont rolled radiations in the labora tory were caus­ ing the mischief. Using hyperse nsitive measuring appar­ atus, the scientists covered the building from top to bot­ tom in an attempt to find out the cause of their colleagues' 22 3"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"unfortunate con dition . Find it they did. However, it was not the radiation of unc ontrolled electrical frequencies. It was low frequency waves which had escaped through a ventilat or and subjected the whole building to subsonic vibrations. By one of those lucky coincidences which have so often helped research, Professor Gavreau had specialized in the investigation of sound waves for twenty years. After the incident he said to himself that it ought to be possible to produce experimentally and deliberately what the ventilat or had uninten tionally achieved. So he and his colleagues built the first sound gun in the world in the Research Institute for Elect roac oustics in Marseilles. Sixty-one tubes in a ches sboard pattern were fixed to a grille. Then compressed air was steadily blown through them until a note of 196 hertz was given off. The resu lt was devastating. Cracks formed in the walls of the new building; the stomachs and intestines of the laboratory workers began to vibrate painfully. The apparatus had to be switched off at once. Professor Gavreau wanted to follow up this experiment, but first he had a protective device made for the sound gun 's crew. Then he built a. gen uine \"death trumpet\" which developed 2,000 watts and sent out sound waves of 37 hertz. This apparatus could not be tested at full strength in Marseilles because it would have sent build­ ings crashing to the ground over a radius of several miles. At present a \"death trump et\" 75 feet long is in the course of construction. It is expected to produce sound waves with the death-dealing frequency of 3.5 hertz. Quite apart from the frig htening vision such a \"death trumpet\" conjures up for the future, it reminds us of an event in antiquity. After the chosen people had crossed the River Jordan without getting their feet wet and bes ieged the town of Jericho with its 21-foo t-thick defense walls, the priests 224"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"were given complicated instructions about marching round the city and blowing their \"trumpet s.\" The event is described in Joshua 6:20 as follows : and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city. Neither the full blast of the priestly lungs nor a fanfare of many thousand trumpets could blow down walls 21 feet thick. But we know today that sound waves with deadly low hertz frequencies would have been perfectly capable of bringing down the walls of Jericho. When Dr. Mottier, an archaeologist at Berne Un iver­ sity, and I were taking part in a debate on the Swiss radio, she told me that giants had never existed because there were no fossil finds from which we could infer the exis­ tence of such a race. Ho wever, Dr. Louis Burkhal ter, former French dele­ gate to the Prehistoric Society, holds a quite different opinion. In 1 95 0, he wrote in the Revue du M usee de Beyr outh : \"I want to make it clear that the existence of gigantic men in the Acheulian Age must be considered a scientifically prove n fact.\" Which side is right? At all events, tools of abnormal size have been found that could not have been handled by men of normal stature. Archaeologists excavated flint implements weighing nearly 8t pounds near Sasnych, 4 miles from Safita in Syria. The flint tools found at Ain Fritissa, in eastern Mo­ rocco, are not to be sneezed at either. They were 12t inches long, 8t inches wide, and weighed 9 ! pounds. If we make a calculation based on the normal human stature and con­ stitution, the beings who were able to handle these clumsy implements must have been about 12 feet tall. 22 5"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"Apart from finds of tools, at least three scientifically accepted finds point to the existence of giants in the past: (I) the Java Giant, (2) the South China giant, and ( 3 ) the South African (Transvaal) giant. What race did they represent? Were they lone wolves? Were they the wrongly prog rammed products of muta­ tions? Were they the direct descendants of gigantic cosmo­ nauts from another world? Were they especially intelli gent bei ngs with advanced ' technical knowhow who had originated according to the genetic code? The foss il finds give no conclusive a ' nswers to my ques­ tions. They are too meager to form the stones for buil ding up a proper genealogy. Will such a family tree ever be systematically invest igated in some specially chosen re­ gion? Sensational discoveries are reported from time to time, but they nearly always turn out to be chance finds. But documents -and we ought to take the old sources literally --dearly confirm the former existence of giants. Mo ses tells us in Genesis 4:4: \"There were giants in the earth in those days ; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daugh­ ters of men, and they bare chil dren to them, the same be­ came mighty men which were of old, men of reno wn .\" We get a graphic account in Nu mbers 1 3 : 33 : \"And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.\" Deu teronomy 3 : 1 I, even gives us details that allow us to make rough estimate of their physical stature : \"For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron ; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits 226"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it. . . . \" (The Heb raic cubit is about I foot 9 inches !) But the Pentateuch is not the only part of the Bible that speaks clearly and unequ ivocally about giants; the later books of the Old Testament also give descriptions of these superm en. Their authors lived at differ ent times and in diff erent places, so they could not have communi­ cated with each other. Nor could the giants, as theologists sometimes claim, have been interpolated into the texts later in order to symbolize evil. If these apologists looked at the texts more closely, they could see that the giants always appear when perform ing perf ectly practical tasks -wa ging war and single combat, for example-but never when moral concepts or moral behavior are under discus­ SlOn. Besides, the documentation of giants is not confined to the Bible. The myths of the Ma yas and Incas also recount that the first race created by the \"gods\" before the Flood was a race of giants. They called two prom inent giants Atlan (Atlas) and Theitani (Titan) . Just like our \"flying gods ,\" giants haunt the world of sagas, legends and sacred books, but they are never put on the same footing as the gods in any of these sources. One serious handicap kept the giants on the earth ; they could not fly. Only when a giant is dearly defined as the off­ spring of a god is he taken along on a heavenly journey. The giants usually appear as the gods' humble and obe­ dient serva nts, who carry out their tasks, until they are finally described as stupid brutish creatures and their traces in literature are lost. A scholar as serious as Professor Denis Saurat, director of the Cent re International d'Etudes Fran�aises in Nice, has made a serious study of giants. He definit ely confirms that they once existed, and even those scholars who raise doubts sooner or later stumble over giants' graves, over 22 7"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"menhirs, those vertical, roughly dressed stone blocks which range up to 6 5 feet in height; over dolmens, burial chambers built of massive stones, or other megalithic mon­ uments; and last but not least, over the impossibility of explaining technical achievements such as the working and transport of gigantic stone blocks. The number of gigantic architectonic edifices and the number of artisti­ cally dressed bould ers we can still marvel at today can only be plausibly explained if we assume the primiti ve erectors of these works to have been giants or beings with techniques unknown to us. Whenever I stand in front of a prehistoric monument on my travels, I always ask myself whether we ought to be satisfied with the previous explanations of its origin and purpose. Surely we ought to band together and have the courage to find out if novel and fantastic interpretations have any validity. During my last journey in Peru in 1 9 68, my friend Hans Neuner and I revisited the megalithic building s above Sacsayhuaman (Falcon Rock) , which is situated at a height of 3 , 45 0 to 3 ,780 feet near the limits of the former Inca fortress of Cuzco. Tape measure and camera in hand, we approached these ruins, which are not ruins at all in the ordinary sense of the word. This is no heap of crumbled stone , remains of some historical building that have become unrecog­ nizable. The rock labyrinth above Sacsayhuaman gives the impression of a superedifice constructed with the last word in technical refinement. Anyone who has spent days in the thin air of this plateau clambering about among stone giants, caves, and rock monstrosities will find it hard to accept the explanation that all this was, created ages ago by human hands using damp wooden wedges and crude stone mallets.

A first-class piece of workl There is nothing botched or crude about the way it has been ex­ tracted, there is no uneven or clumsy dressing. Even if we are prepared to admit the possibility that extremely skilled stonemasons managed to free the four lateral in­ cisions of the colossus from the roc k. face after many years of work, we are still left with the riddle of how they freed the rear side of the rectangle. In those days the stone­ masons certainly did not have cutting jibs of the kind used today when excavating the stone for underground sub­ marine shelters. And presumably they did not possess the chemical knowledge to free the stone block from the rock face with the help of acids. . Or did they? We climbed down into some caves in the rock that were 180 to 240 feet deep. As if shaken by some primeval force, the caves' course has been int errupted and they are par­ tially destroyed or telescoped together. Large sections of the ceilin gs and walls have been preserved. They are so perfect that they could compete with any present-day piece of precast concrete. Nothing has been joined to­ gethe r; there are no parts held together by a binding agent.

Eight-inch-wide granite ledges lie stepwise as neatly as if the wooden mold had been taken away yes­ terday . We walked upright through galleries and chambers, waiting tensely for the surprise awaiting us around the next turning. I kept on thinking about the current archae­ ological explanations of these masterpieces of technology, but they did not convince me.

Movements of the earth 's crust? The last violent move­ ment is supp osed to have taken place about 200,000 years ago. Earthquakes? They could hardly have caused the dam­ age which leaves so much order recogn izable among the disorder. To add a double question mark after all the questions, the dressed granite blocks show signs of vitri­ fication of the kind that only appears as the result of tre­ mendously high temperatures. Freaks of nature? The granite blocks have accurately cut grooves and they have mortises as if they had been torn loose from the block next to them. Neit her the city archaeologist at CUlCO nor his col­ leagues in the museums of Lima could give me a satis­ factory explanation of the structures we had examined. ':Pre- Inc a,\" they said, \"or perhaps the Tiahuana co cul­ ture.\" Of course, there is nothing shameful about admitting one's ignorance. The fact remains that no one knows any­ thing definit e about the blocks we saw above Sacsayhua­ man. Only one thing is cert ain. This great complex was built by a method unkno wn to us by being s unknown to us at an unkn own date. It is also certain that it exis ted and had already been des troyed again before the famous Inca fortress of the Sun God was built. This applies equally to Ti ahua naco on the Bolivian plateau. 2 3 0"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"I had studied many books on the subject and learned extraordinary things about Tiahu anaco in the process, but everything in them was surpassed by what I saw with my own eyes. I had also read a lot about the remarkable water conduits that were discovered at Tiahuanaco. Dur­ ing my last journey to the Bolivian plateau I singled them out for special study. There I stood in Tiahuanaco, 15 ,000 feet above sea level, for the second time. I had paid too little attention to the water conduits during my first brief visit, but this time I wanted to rectif y the omission. I found the first remarkable example of these half pipes set in the wall of a reconstructed temple. It had been ar­ bitrarily put there. Where it sat in the wall, the half pipe was quite pointless, except perhaps in a decora tive sense, as if it were aimed at the tourists. When I was able to examine the water conduits in other places, I found that what I had read about them was true. They had a completely modern shape with smooth cross sections, polished inner and outer surfaces, and accurate edges. The half pipes have grooves and cor­ respond ing protrusions that fit together. They can be joined like childr en's Lego pieces. If I was staggered by the technical and mechanical per­ fection of these works that the archaeologists attribut e to pre-Inca tribes, I was absolutely flabbergasted when I saw that the finds long classified as water conduits existed in the form of double pipes. One conduit was masterp iece enough, but now there were double pipes made out of one piece of rock. What is more, double pipes with faultlessly executed right-angled sections. But how can anyone explain the fact that only the upper parts of the pipes have been found? For the upper parts of water conduits can be dispensed with, but not the lower pipes. Did these stone pipes serve as water conduits at all? 2 3 1"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"Perhaps there is a quite different explanation, fanciful though it may seem. Traditional legends and existing stone drawings tell us that the \"gods\" met at Ti ahuan aco before man was even created. In the language of our space age that means that unknown astronauts constructed their first base on the Bolivian plateau. They had a highly developed technol ogy at their disposal, just as we today use laser beams, vibrat­ ing milling -tools, and electric apparatus. Looked at from that point of view, is it not more likely that the water con­ duits were protective pipes for energy cables between in­ dividua l buildings of the complex? Beings who were capable of making pipes like those at Tiahuanaco must have possessed outstanding technical skills. Beings with such a high level of intell igence would not have been so stupid as to make water conduits with double pipes when they could simply have bored a large,. hol e in the sa me stone to let dou bl e the amount of water pass th mugh by a very much simpler process and with very much less work. Intelligent beings with such abilit ies would not have chosen a right-angled shape for the trans­ port of water because they would have known that water and dirt would collect in the corners. And naturally these technicians would also have made the lower sections of piping if it was really needed for the transport of water. When the Spanish conquist adors asked the natives about the builders of Tiahuanaco in the 1 5 �0's, they could give no information about them. They referred the Spaniards to the sagas, according to which Tiahuanaco was the place where the gods had created men. I suspect that the same \"gods\" also made the pipes and that they did not use them as water conduits. Archaeologists and anthropologists do their best to give dates to all historical finds. Once a find is dated, it assumes its predestined place in the existing system and, of course. it is given a catalog number. 2 3 2"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"So far, the C-14 method is the most accurate used by science. When using it, scientists start from the premise that the radioactive isotope of carbon (C) , with the atomic weight 14, is present in our atmosphere in con­ stant amounts. This carbon isotope is absorbed by all plants, so that trees, roots, leaves and grasses contain it in amount s that remain the same. But all living organisms absorb vegetable matter in some form or other, so men and animals also contain C- 14 in the same propo rtion. Now radioactive substances have a definite period of dis­ integration, provided no new radioactive substances are added. This period of disintegration in men and animals begins with death, in plants with harvesting or burning. The carbon isotope C-14 disintegrates at the rate of one half its amount in about 5,600 years. This means that 5,600 years after the death of an organism, only the origi­ nal amount of C-14 is detectable, after 11,200 years only a quarter, after 22,400 only an eighth, and so on. Since the original amount of C-14 in the atmosphere is known , the C-14 content of fossilized organic matter can be found out by a complicated laboratory process. In relation to the constant C- 14 content of the atmosphere, the age of a bone or a piece of charcoal can then be determined. If grasses and bushes on the edge of a highway are cut and burned, the ashes give a false age of many thousands of years. Why is that? Day after day, the plants have ab­ sorbed large amounts of carbon petroleum, but that in turn comes from organic material that stopped absorbing C- 14 from the atmosphere millions of years ago. Thus a tree cut down in an industrial district may be only fifty years old accord ing to its annual rings, but examinati ons by the C- I 4 method would date the wood ash so far back that the fifty-year-old tree would have had to have been planted in very remote times.

That is one reason which makes me skeptical about datings that go very far back. Let us take the case of Tiahuanaco. If cosmonauts did leave our planet from there after completing their mission, they certainly did not leave any fossil heirlooms behind for the anthropolo­ gists and archaeo logists. They had modern equipment and did not use charcoal fire's for heating, and they took their bones away with them. In other words, they left absolutely no datable traces behind them. Bones and charcoal re­ mains that are found on the presumed landing places of the astronauts and then analyzed and dated come from men who settled among the ruins of the gods' fortress thousands of years later. I think it is a mistake to assume that the bones that have been excavated came from the builders of Tiahuanaco. I ask new questions because the old answers do not satisfy me. Archaeology has only existed as a scientific discipline for 200 years. Its representatives scrupulously collect coins, clay tablets, fragm ents of utensils, shards of vessels, figures, drawings, bones and everything the earth yields up to the spade. They arrange the finds neatly in a system that only has a relative validity for about 3 , 5 00 years. Anything that lies farther back remains hidden behind a veil of riddles and suppositions.

The worms were allowed a break of two hours before they were put on the rack ag ain. Then it turned out that they had not forg otten that they must expect an elec­ tric shock after the light came on. They curled up after it was switched on even if the expect ed shock did not come. Next, the two patient invest igators cut the worms into small pieces and waited for a month until the parts had regenerated to complete worms.

For example, rats were taught to press a specially colored key if they wanted to reach their food . When the animals had completely mastered their lesson, they were killed, an .extract was taken from their brains and injected into the abdominal cavities of un­ trained rats. After only a few hours the untrained rats were already using the same colored key. Experiments with goldfish and rabbits confirmed the assumption that learned knowl edge can be transmitted from one body to another by the transfer of certain cells. Today it is an accepted scientific fact that memories are stored in memory molecules and that RNA and DNA molecules establish and transport memory contents. If these investigations were -carried a step farther, mankind might be able in the fores eeable future to stop knowl edge and memory disappearing when a man dies, and to pre­ serve and transmit the intellectual possessions he has ac­ quired. Shall we live to see hype rintelli gent dolphins, pro­ grammed in. underwater research, go to diving stations? Shall we see apes whose brains have been progra mmed to handle road-making machines working in the streets? These things may sound ridiculous today, but I think that the man who doubts their practic ability is sticking his neck out more than the man who reckons with them as serious possibilities. As yet there is no scientific proof that unknown intel­ ligences knew how to carry out this kind of memo ry mani­ pulation in the remote past. Nevertheless, famous scien­ tists such as Shklovsky, Sagan, and others do not exclude the probability that there are living beings on other planets who have advanced far beyond our stage of scien­ tific research . Once again the Old Testament gives food for thought. It tells of several prophets who were given books to eat by the \"gods .\" 2 4 1"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"Ezekiel 3 : 3 recounts such a book feas t: \"And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat , and fill thy bowels with this roll [of a book] that I give thee.

Since the scientific discovery of the DNA double helix, we know that the nucleus of the gene contains all the information necess ary for the construction of an org ani sm. Punched cards are so famili ar today that to simplify things I should like to call the building plan that is progra mmed in the nuclei \"pu nched cards gover ning life.\" These punched cards build life according to a very precise time schedule. Let us take our own species as an example. A ten-year-old boy and an eight-year-old girl are obviously adults in mini ature, but they do not possess many of the attributes they will have one day as man and woman. Before they have grown up, the cells in their bodies will have divided a trillion times and with each cell division new building stages will be summoned from the punched card. Boys and girls begin to grow rapidly ; pubic hair, facial hair and breasts begin to show. The punched cards never make a mistake ; their holes deter­ mine the course of grow ing up at exactly the right times. I should like to emphasize once aga in that this is a fact that applies to every org anism. So on this solid scientific basis I should like to put up for discussion an idea that I personally find quite logical. Why should there not have been a comprehensive building plan for the whole of man­ kind-as for every individual bei ng-s ince the remotest times? An thropological, archaeological, and eth nological facts embolden me to add my the ory to other hypotheses of the origin of mankind. I suspect that in the case of primitive man all the information, i.e., all the orders punc hed in 2 4 2"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"the cards, was introduced from outside by a planned ar­ tificial mutation. If we follow my theory back into the dark maze of man­ kind's prehistory, man is both the son of earth and child of the gods. Tremendous and fantastic consequences re­ sult from this dual desc ent. Our ances tors experienced their age, the primordial past, directly. They took it into their consciousness and their memory stored up every event. As each new genera­ tion came into being a part of this primiti ve memory was transferred to it. Simult aneously, each generation added new holes to the existing ones in the punched cards. The cards were constantly enriched with new information. Even if some information was lost in the course of time or had stronger impulses superimposed on it, the sum of all information did not decrease. But now man houses not only the punched holes of his own memories, but also the prog ramming of the gods, who were already traveling in space in Adam's dayl Between our present knowle dge and the wealth of these memories there stands a barrier which only a few men manage to break through at fortunate moments. Sensitive men-poe ts, painters, musi cians and scientist s-- sense the creative stimulation of this primordial memory and often strug gle desperately to recapture the stored-up infonna­ tion. The medicine man puts himself into a trance with drugs and monotonous rhythms so that he can break through the barrier to the primitive memory. I also be­ lieve that even behind the trendy behavior of the psyche­ delic pioneers, a primitive instinct is at work that drives them to seek access to the unconscious by using drugs and exacerbating music. But even if the door to a buried world is sometimes opened in individual cases, most people are incapable of communicating to others what they exper­ ienced in their exalted state. For example, Alad din's lamp is always quoted when 2 43"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"people want to describe a fantastic apparatus or miracu­ lous process. Not only do I take the prophets literally, but also I have gotten into the habit of seeking something real behind the strange, primit ive memories of the men of antiquity, something real that many only await (re)dis­ covery by us today. What was the special thing about Aladdin's lamp? The fact that it could material ize supernatural beings when­ ever young Aladdin rubbed it. Is it possible that he set a materializat ion machine going when he rubbed it? In the light of the present-day knowledge there is a possible explanation of the magic lamp. We know that atomic technology turns mass into energy and that physics turns energy into mass. A television picture is split up into hund reds of thous a nds of lines that are radiated over relay stations after they have been transformed into waves of energy. Let us take a leap into the fantastic. A table-including the one I am sitting at now-consists of a countl ess num­ ber of juxtaposed atoms. If it were possible to split the table up into its atomic components, send it out in energy waves and reconstruct it in its original form at a given place, the transport of matter would be solved . Sheer fantasy? I admit that it is today, but in the future? Perhaps the memory of the men of antiquity was still haunted by the remembrance of materializations that had been seen in very remote times. Today steel is dipped in liquid nitrogen to harden it. To us a natural process that was discovered in modern times. But probably owing to a primitive memory, this hardening process was already a reality in antiquity. At all events, it was practiced with very crude methods. For case harde ning, the men of old plung ed red-hot swords into the bodies of live prisoners!

Ideas which we still find confusing and disturbing have probably already been turned into reality on our planet at some time in the past. It was during my study of Teil hard de Chardin (18 81- 19 55 ) , whose books have made a great impact on many people today, that I first came across the concept of cosmic primordial parts. Only later ages will realize what a de­ cisi ve say this Jesuit has had in forming the twentieth­ century world picture with his palaeontological and an­ thropological researches, in which he wanted to combine Catholic teach ing about the creation with the findin gs of present-day natural science. In 1 9 62, seven years after his death, it was decided, after a violent theological dispute, that Teilhard's views violated Catholic doctrine. I know of no concept that expresses so clearly what is meant by the cosmic processes. The primordial part of matter is the atom. The atom is also the material pri­ mordial part in the cosmos. But there are other pri­ mordial parts, for example, time, consciousness and mem­ ory. In ways as yet unexplained all these primordial parts are related and connected with one another. Perhaps one day we shall track down other primordial parts, i.e., forc es, which cannot be defined ·or classified either physi­ cally, chemically or in other scientific categor ies. Yet even though they cannot be defined or conceived of materially, they have an effect on the cosmic process. And as far as I am concerned , the fronti ers where all research will and must end lie in the cosmos. I sincerely hope that my observations will set up new signposts leading eventually to convincing results. Two cases which Pauwels and Bergier mention in their book BTe altthr ough into the Th ird Millennium are directly in line with my conviction that primitive memories await 246"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"their discovery in the human consciousness. There is nothing occult or esoteric about either of them. The first concerns the Danish Nobel Prize winner Niels Bohr (18 85- 1 9 62) , who laid the foundations for present-day atomic theory. This wor ld-f amous physicist related how the idea of the atom model he had sought for many years occurred to him. He dreamed that he was sitting on a sun of burning gas. Planets rushed past him, hissing and spit­ ting, and all the planets seemed to be connect ed by fine threads to the sun around which they revolved. Suddenly the gas solidified, sun and planets shriveled up and became motionless. Niels Bohr said that he woke up at this mo­ ment. He realized at once that what he had seen in his dream was the atom model. In 1922 he won the Nobel Prize for his dream. The second case mentioned by Pauwels and Bergier also concerns two natural scientists who figure as both dream­ ers and men of action. An engineer of the Bell Telephone Company in the Unit ed States read reports of the bomb­ ing of London in 1940. They upset him badly. One au­ tumn night he dreamed he was drawing the design of an apparatus that could train antia ircraft guns on the pre­ viously worked-out path of an aircraft and ensure that their shells would hit the aircraft at a specific point re­ gardless of its speed. The next morning the Bell engineer made a sketch of what he had already drawn in his dream . He finally built a set in which radar was used for the first time. The celebrated American mathematician Norbert Wiener (18 9 4 -1 9 6 4 ) was in charge of the project for manufacturing it commercially. I believe that what these two brilliant natural scientists dreamed already rested on the basis of their age-old knowledge. In the beginning there is always an idea, or a.dream , that has to be proved in practice. I think it quite likely that one day the molecular geneticists, who already know how the genetic code functions, will also find out 2 47"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"how much -a nd even which-information was pro­ grammed on the punched cards of our life by unknown intell igences. It sounds fantastic, but one fine day we might even discover by which code word a specific piece of knowle dge for a specific purpose can be summoned up from the primiti ve memory. In my opinion cosmic memories penet rated more and more strongly into our consciousness in the course of man 's evolution. They encour aged the birth of new ideas, which had already been realized in practice at the time of the visit by the \"gods .\" At certain fortunate moments the barriers separating us from the primit ive mem ory fall. Then the driving forces brought to light aga in by the stored-up knowle dge become active in us. Is it only a coincidence that printing and clockmaking, that the car and the airplane, that the laws of grav ity and the functioning of the genetic code, were invented and discovered almost simult aneously at diff erent times in dif­ ferent parts of the world? Is it pure coinci dence that the stimu lating idea of visits to our planet by unknown intell igences has appeared simultan eously and been put forward in a great many books with completely diff erent argument and sources? It is, of course, extremely convenient to dismiss ideas as coinci dences when there seems to be no cut and dried explanation for them, but that is too easy a way out. Scien­ tists, who have generally tried hard to find rules behind all processes, should be the last people to reject sum marily new ideas-however fantastic they may seem at first -as unsuit able for serious resear ch. Today we know that the plan for the growth and death of every org anism is coded in its nucleus.

Is that absolutely necessary? Surely there is constant proof that the pencil shape is neither necessary nor ideal in air­ less space. When a spaceship, which, unlike the multi­ stage rocket, is at least cone shaped, flies to the nearby moon, it has to revolve repeatedly on its own axis. How involved and danger ousl We know from all the accounts of space flight that every change of course calls for a highly complicated steering maneuver. The ship's computer has to find out deviations from the flight path in thousandths of a second and equally qui ckly actuate the small steering jets for course correc tion. A single, minute steering mis­ take would have devas tating consequences, as only limited amounts of propulsive material are carried and they would soon be used up. Then the steering jets would no longer be able to carry out the course corr ections, the spacecraft would be unable to return to the earth's at­ mosphere, and it would shoot through the uni verse out of control until it burned up.

The time when technology will have as yet incred­ ible energies at its disposal is no longer so far away. \"\"'hen that time comes, it could lead to pure photon propulsion units that reach a velocity close to the speed of light and can provide propulsion for an almost unlim ited period. Then we should no longer have to economize on every pound of payload, as we do today, when for every pound that a spacecraft takes on a journey to the moon, an extra 2, 59 0 pounds of fuel is needed. Once that were the case , spacecraft would soon be built in a very diff erent shape. Old texts and archaeological finds around the world have convinced me that the first spacecraft that reached the earth many thousands of years ago were spherical, and I am sure that the spacecraft of the future will, once again, be spherical. I am no rocket designer, but there are a couple of reflec­ tions that we can all make and which seem completely convincing. A sphere has no forward or aft, no above or below, no right or left. It offers the same surface in every position and direction. So the sphere is the ideal shape for the cosmos, which also has no above or below, no forward or aft. Let us take a walk around a space sphere that still seems like a science-fiction dream today. But let's not skimp matters. Imagine a sphere with a diameter of 17,000 feet. This monster stands on sprung , retractable spider legs. Like an ocean liner, the interior is divided into decks of various sizes. Around the belly of the gigantic ball -at its equa tor- runs a massive ring housing the twenty or more prop ulsion units that can all be swiveled through 180 2 5 1"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"degrees--a simple technical feat. When the coun tdown has reached zero, they will radiate concentrated light waves amplified a milli onfold. If the cosmic sphere is to rise from the surface of the planet or one of the launching areas stationed in orbit, the propulsion units shoot their columns of light directly down onto the launching pad, giving the sphere a tremendous thrust. Once the sphere has reached the extragr avitational field and is on its course to a fixed star, the propulsion unit s around its equat or will only be fired now and then for course cor rections. There is no risk of the sphere moving out of its flight path in a way that might endang er the crew because it can imme­ diately adapt itself to any situation. Besides, something happens that will be very pleasant for the astronauts. The sphere begins to rotate of its own accord. In this way an artificial gravity is created in all the external rooms that decreases the state of weightlessness so much that condi­ tions are almost the same as on earth. If one flies to the stars, one is still bound by one of the laws of the old earth! It is important to realize that in this kind of space sphere course corr ections in any direction are possible without danger. The propulsion unit s mounted on the steel girdle round the sphere perm it lightnin g-avo iding action or quick turns in any direction. Billi ards players will easily catch on to the idea. If a right turn is needed, the sphere gets a light touch from a steering jet mounted on the left and vice versa. Spherical spacecraft of the kind that may have traversed the galaxies millennia ago will be only minute particles in the infin ity of the universe. Shooting along close to the speed of light, the astronauts will only sense this tempo as a slow, soft floating away. Time will seem to stand still in their craft. But what will happen in the timeless time in the in­ terior of the cosmic sphere? Well, once space stations of 2 5 2"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"that size actually travel, a perfectly normal everyday rou­ tine will be followed on board. Robots will keep a check on the functioning of motors and machinery, computers will watch the course, astronauts will carry out scientific research in laboratories, think out still bolder proj ects, observe the stars, and think about the exploitation of unknown planets. While the sphere covers millions of miles a minute, days will become · weeks, weeks will be­ come months, and months become years for the crew. And in deepf reeze sarcophagi a reserve crew will await its bio­ logical reawake ning when the sphere nears its goal. But simu ltaneously on coun tless planets whole cul tures will disappear, generations will die, and new ones will be born, for time will rush by accord ing to terres trial laws on our planet and other stars. I won't expand on the excursion to utopia. Science­ fiction writ ers have described imaginary spaceships of the future only too often. l\\l y sphere story is solely intended to prepare the reader 's imagination for a perfectly serious idea. Su ppose we examine the first legends of mankind's creation with this sphere story in mind. We learned in school that in the beginning there were only heaven and earth and that the earth was deserted and barren. But out in the darkness, we were taught, shone a light and from this light came the word which gave the order for all life to begin. Everyth ing about the temporal unfolding of this genesis is absolutely logic al. During the long cosmic journey through the universe, there was obviously no light; all was pitch-black night. \"There was light\" only after the land­ ing of the cosmic vehicle on the planet and then the un­ known bein gs experienced day and night, and life could begin and intell igence originate at the goal of their jour­ ney-in answer to a word of command. In nearly all known creation legends the primordial truth is repeated that the word came from the light.

A select circle of priests watched carefully to see that not a word of the old philo­ sophical and astronomical wisdom was changed, but Western civil ization and Christian missionaries stifled the rich tradition that the original population had possessed. In 19 30, the Bishop Mu seum of Honolulu, which has the largest Polynesian collection in the world, sent two expe­ ditions to the islands. Their aim was to safeguard the genealogies and songs that had survived the dubious bless­ ing of Western colonization. Years later the Swedish scholar Bengt Danielsson, who had crossed the Pacific on the Kon- Tiki raft with Thor Heyerdahl, visited some of the South Sea islands with his wif e and wrote down the trad itions that were still alive in the consciousness of the islanders.

Among the creation stories that strengthen my theory, another myth-that of the Chibcha (i.e ., men) -is a real jew el. The historical home of these people, whom the Spani ards discovered in 15 3 8, is on the east Colombian plateau. The Spanish chronicler Pedro Simon describes the myth of the Chibcha in his No tici as hi st oria les de las con­ qui stasde de tier ra firme en las Ind ias Oc cident ales : It was night. There was still something of the world. The light was closed up in a big \"something house\" and came out of it. This \"something house\" is \"Chimini gagua,\" and it hid the light in it, so that it came out. In the bright­ ness of the light things began to come into being. . . . I can see that it must have been difficult for translators and interpreters to find a clear-c ut equivalent for the word \"something hous e.\" But how lucky for us that they left this concept that is so hard to understand and did not re­ place it by a fanciful synonym. Otherwise we might not be able to interpret correctly the significance of this tra­ diti on and grasp its full importance. But now we can measure the \"something house\" against our present knowledge. As the Chibcha had never seen a spacecraft before, they obviously did not know what to call it. So they paraphrased it in words that were familiar to them: Something like a house had landed and the \"gods\" came out of it.

Since not more than eight blocks can go on one parchment page, it is understandable that the volumes have to be housed in the cellars of whole villages. Only a hundredth part of these texts, whose origi­ nal date is not fixed, has been translated. In both these mysterious works there is constant mention of \"pearls in the sky\" and transparent spheres, in which the gods dwell, to show themselves to men at great intervals.

In the old Chinese classic Tao-te-king there is one of the most beautiful definitions of the origin of the Cosmos, life and earth: The meaning that one can invent is not the eternal meaning. The name that one can name is not the eternal name. Beyond the nameable lies the beginning of the world. On this side of the nameable lies the birth of creatures.

In the Un ited States, for example, balls have been found in Tennessee, Arizona, Calif ornia, and Ohio. In 19 40, Professor Marcel Hornet, the archaeologist now living in Stutt gart and author of the well-known book Sons of the Sun, discovered a gigantic stone egg 3 28 feet long and 9 8 feet high on the upper Rio Branco in North Amazonas, Bra zil. On this colossal block, which was called Piedra Pint ada, or painted stone, Hornet found countless letters, crosses and sun symbols over a surface area of some 700 square yards. He assured me in conversa­ tion that there was not the slightest doubt that this mag­ nificent specimen was no freak of nature, but stonemaso n's work carried out by coun tless hands over many decades. But the real archaeological sensation in the ball line awaits its solution in the small Central American state of Costa Rica. There hundreds, if not thousands, of artificial stone balls lie about in the middle of the jungle and on high mountains, in river deltas and on hillt ops. Their diameters vary between a few inches and eight feet. The heaviest ball excavated to date weighs eight tonsl I had heard about this sensation, and because of it I spent ten days in Costa Rica, a typical developing country that has so far been shunned by the vast mass of tourists. My journey turned out to be anything but a pleasure trip, but all the har dships were richly rewarded by what I saw. The first balls I came across were lying around in flat coun try for no apparent reas on. Then I found several gro ups of balls on the tops of hills. Some always lay in the center of the hill's longitudinal axis. I waded through the mud of a riverbed and found great groups of balls in strange formations that were unint elligible, although they must have been deliberate.

Have they something to say that we were or are incapable of understanding? In order to satisfy my curiosity to see and photograph the balls near Piedras Blancas southeast of the River Coto, also in Costa Rica, we had to spend a whole day in a Land Rover to cover a distance of only sixty miles. Time and again, we had to remove obstacles from the track, pull the Land Rover out of ruts, and grind around innum erable bends. Finally our vehicle would take us no farther. Bubu, a half breed, who was guiding us, ran ahead of us for an hour and cleared the way of creatures. Without his pre­ cautions we should twice have run into spider webs of a size you simply cannot imagine. The poisonous bite of these loathsome creatures can be fatal. At last we stood before two enormous balls, both taller than we were, in the midst of the virgin forest. It was precisely because the stones near Piedras Blancas lay deep in the jungle that I had wanted to see them with my own eyes. It is said that these balls are only a few hundred years old. No one who has stood there as I have could believe that. The jungle itself is primeval and I am convinced that the balls must have lain there before the luxuriant vegetation began to thrive. Today we have managed to tr ansplant Abu Simbel to another site using all kinds of modern machinery, but I doubt whether we could deposit balls like these in a primeval forest. I saw still more balls in Costa Rica. Fifteen giant balls lie in a dead straight line in Golfo Dulce. I found twelve balls near the village of Uvita, north of the Sierra Brunquera. Four balls have been excavated from the muddy bed of the River Esquina. There are two balls on Camaronal Island and several 266"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"balls on the summit of the Cordillera Brunquera in the neighborhood of the River Diquis. Most of these mysterious balls are made of granite or lava. There is little chance nowadays of finding out the exact number of stone balls that once existed. Today many fine specimens decorate gardens and parks and publi c buildi ngs. Since one ancient saga also related that gold could be found in the middle of the balls, many of them have been hacked to bits with hammer and chisel. A strange thing is that there are no quarries for producing the balls anywhere near the sites where they have been found. As in other places any trace that could lead us back to the manuf acturers is missing. During the clearing of woods and swamps at the foot of the Cordillera Brunquera in the Rio Diquis district in 1 94 0 and 1 94 1, the archaeologist Doris Z. Stone discovered several artificial stones. She wrote a detailed account of them that closes with the resigned remark : \"The balls of Costa Rica must be numbe red among the unsolved mega­ lithic puzzles of the wor ld.\" In fact, we do not know who made the stone balls; we do not know what tools were used for the work ; we do not know for what purpose the balls were cut out of the gran­ i te and we do not know when they were made. Everything that archaeologists say today in explanation of the Indian balls, or sky balls, as the natives call them, is pure specula­ tion. A local legend says that each ball represents the sun -an acceptable interpretation. But the archaeologists re­ ject this version, because in these latitu des the sun has been represented in all ages as a golden orb, wheel or disk, and never as a ball-neither among the Incas, Mayas, nor Aztecs. One thing is quite certain. The stone balls cannot have originated without mechanical help. They are perfectly executed- absolutely spherical, with smoothly polished surfaces. 267"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"Archaeologists who have investigated the balls of Costa Rica confirm that none of them de,\\)iates in the slightest from a given diameter. This precision implies that the men who made them had a good knowledge of geometry and possessed the appropriate technical implements. If the stonemasons had first buried the raw material in the earth and then worked on the protruding section, un­ evenness and inaccuracies would inevitably have resulted because the distances to ' the part stuck in the ground could no longer have been checked. This primitive pro­ cedure is out of the question. The raw material must have been transported from somewhere because there are no nearby quarries, and that alone must have been very arduous. In addition , the stone blocks must have been broken out or cut out of the rock. My conclusion is that many workers were engaged in the task for a long time and that they possessed tools which made possible such perfect stone dressing. Even if all this is accepted, it still does not explain why the finished balls were rolled to a particular site, e.g., the top of a mountain. What an absur d idea and what a tre­ mendous expenditure of labor! However, an explanation is given, though it only seems suitable for the most super­ ficial kind of guidebook. The gigantic balls were rolled down riverbeds. I should laugh at such naivete if the problem involved were not so serious to me. The massive heavy balls would simply have stuck in the muddy, and in parts grave lly, riverbeds. One irritating fact which cannot have altered in the course of the ages confronts the holders of the riverbed theory. Between the granite mountains in which the material for the majority of the balls must have been quarried and the sites where the balls were found in the Diquis delta, the steaming jungle extends far and wide, and the three small rivers that exist are considerable ob­ stacles to transporting material on such a scale without 268"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"deep-loading lorries, cranes, and special freight ships. And as if these barriers were not enough, when seen from the granite cliffs, most of the balls lie on the far side of the Rio Diqu is! In other words, the forwarding agents would have had to conjure the material over this barrier, too. I have noticed that whenever archaeologists cannot explain gigantic feats of transport, they have recourse to the so-called rolling theory. But this is pitifully inadequate when one sees the giant balls on the tops of mountains. An expert has told me that at least 24 tons of raw material are needed to make a stone ball weighing 16 tons. In view of the large numbers of balls, one can roughly guess what masses of raw material must have been moved about here in the past. I had seen the miraculous world of the stone balls and convinced myself of their disturbing existence. Now I wanted to try to find the solution of this puzzle as well, but when I asked the Costa Ricans about the origin and mean­ ing of the stone balls, I met silence and suspicion. Al­ though visited by missionaries and \"enlightened\" by con­ tinuous econom ic contacts with the West, the natives re­ mained superstitious in their heart of hearts. Two archae­ ologists whom I questi oned in the Museo Nacional of San Jose explained that the creation of the balls was connected with a star 'cult, perhaps too with calendar repres entations, and possibly with religious or magic signs. I needled away patiently because these explanations did not satisfy me, but finally had to realize that the mystery of the balls was taboo to them , for some reason incompreh ensible to me. As the archaeologists could not or would not help any further, I tried asking some of the Indians. Trained by my acquaintance with natives in many countries, I soon sensed that they were afraid of something as soon as the conversa tion came round to the balls. Nevertheless, it is extremely surprising that these poor creatures, who haggle over every centimo, would not 26 9"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"guide me to an 1,Soo-foot-high cliff with three balls on top, no matter how much I offered them. Bubu was an exception. A German, who has owned the Pension Anna in San Jose for over forty years, is considered to be the man who possesses the most material about the balls. He pulled out many impressive pictures, but behaved as if he had to keep the secret of some buried treasure. He showed me sketches of formations and groupings of balls, but refused to give their exact location. I was not even allowed to copy his sketches. \"No, it's out of the question\" was his inevitable reply. Even if I had not known it beforehand, I should have realized during my stay in Costa Rica that there is a mystery about the stone balls. I could not solve it, but my suspicion increased that the prehistoric balls and all the pictures of them in reliefs and on cave walls are directly linked with the visit of unknown intell igences, of intelli­ gences who landed on our planet in a ball. They already knew and had proved that the sphere is the most suitable shape for interstellar space flights.

The Russians also received details from the sondes which had made soft landin gs. Acco rding to them, the Venusian atmo­ sphere has a carbon dioxide content of 9 3 to 97 perce nt, while nitrogen makes up 2 to 5 per cent, and oxygen appar ently only accounts for 0. 4 perce nt. At a pressure of barely I atmosphere, the measuring apparatus regis­ tered a water cont ent of only 4 to I 1 mill igrams per liter. These data are valuable working material.

Owing to this steady reduction of carbon dioxide, the surf ace temperature would grad ually fall and finally sink below 100° C. Blue algae would then cause the same chem ical reactior i as once took place in the primiti ve soup of our earth. With the help of light and water, carbon dioxide particles could be transformed into oxy­ gen.

On Jul y 20, 1 9 6 9 , at ° 3 00 hours, 56 minut es, 20 seconds, Cent ral European Time, hundreds of millions of people saw the two astronauts Neil Alden Armstrong and Edwin E. Aldrin become the first men to set foot on the moon. This was the most mag­ nifi cent achievement in space travel to date, and it fasci­ nated and astonished humanity all over the globe. But even while man was following the breathtaking flight to the moon, science was already occupied with expl oratory flights to Mars and Venus, and even with a vast human migration to ear th's sister planet. Just as the conquest of the moon began with unm anned satellites, Venus is now' being investig ated with unmanned sondes. On May 18, 1 9 6 9 , Mo scow reported that after a flight lasting 1 3 0 days, the Venus sonde 5 had ended the j ourney of 156,25°,000 miles with a payload of 2,26 0 pounds. When the sonde was still 3 1,250 miles from Venus, the ground station ra­ dioed the last command. Then the sonde sent down a cap­ sule full of instruments by para chute. Tass stated that the parachute drop lasted 5 3 minut es.

The Russian sondes do not reach Venus by the shortest route. That sounds para­ doxical, but the Russian principle for the flight paths of the Venus sondes is valid for all presen t-day interplanetary flights. The flight path is calculated accord ing to the min­ imum quantity of fuel necessary for the transport of the spacecraft. If the sonde were launc hed on the direct course to Venus, it would have to have an initial velocity of 20 miles per second. In that case vast quantities of fuel would be used not only at launching, but also for braking the initial velocity later on. Co n sequently, ballistic experts prefer to calculate flight paths that approximate the move­ ment of the earth as far as possible. The most favorable route on these premises is ten times as long 'as the direct route, but it allows a launching velocity of 7.17 5 miles per second and a far lower consumpti on of fuel. What is there left that is really utopian? Prelimin ary research becomes applied science at such a breathtaking speed that science-fiction writers have a hard job invent­ ing the unimaginable. In 1 9 6 9 , Professor Hans Laven, director of the Institute of Geneti cs at the University of Mainz, published a report accord ing to which millions of insects that are dangerou s to men, animals and plants as disease carriers could be killed without the use of insecticides, the chem ical agents with which dangerous insects and their brood are de­ stroyed at present. As early as 1 9 67, Laven was able to show the efficacity of his research in the Burmese town of Okpo, which was plagued by midges. Within a few months Okpo was freed of its plague. Laven had experimented in the laboratories at Mainz for years. In the process he found out that there is a natural incomp atibility between midges of different ori­ gin. Midges from North Germany showed themselves will­ ing to mate with members of their species from Schwaben, 27 4"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"but the midge offspring produced were not viable. If the midges from different German provinces had an antipathy for each other, then midges from different continents would surely produce offspring that were unviable. So they bred a race from Californian and French midges. When they were released in the town of Okpo, the males of the Mainz bastard race proved to be great lovers and competed successfully with the Burmese males, but the eggs laid by the wives they had mated with did not pro­ duce any new midges. The chromosome count of the dif­ ferent species of midge did not tally and genetic destruc­ tion took place. The advantage of this way of destroy ing midges is obviou s: The risk of contaminating food and plants by spraying them with insecticides disappears. Professor Laven is continuing his researches on the basis of the most recent genetic discoveries. He radiates male midges with about 4,000 r X rays. This does not cause the creatures any organic damage, but the chromo­ some chain between the genes is damaged. The chromo­ some household is disturbed, the genes are changed and insects develop in an unprogrammed sequence. They are still capable of reproduction, but their offspring are re­ duced in every way, i.e., in number, size, etc. Of some midge generations treated in this way that continue to hand down their planned disability, Laven said: \"There is no cure for semisterilit y because it is hereditar y.\" Laven is convinced that in a comparatively short time it will be possible to use his model experiment against other harmful insects; he even thinks that the plagues of rats in many parts of the world can be tackled in this way. The tremendous possibilities of manipulating the ge­ netic code are no visionary dream. We are dealing with scientific facts.

Our brain works with more than 1 5 billion switches, whereas a large modern com­ puter uses only 10,000,000. Further elements can be set up between the switches by cross connections. Then why does a computer work so much more reliably than our brain? Because generally nine tenths of our brain lies fallow, but the computer always has all its bits prese nt.

They were old Japanese statues cast in bronze, and they seemed to be dressed in space suits. The largest of the statues was nearly 2 feet high and had a diameter of about 5 inches. Tight­ fitting bands ran from the shoul ders, crossed the chest, and joined up again between the thighs at the height of the buttocks. A broad belt with rivets on it was round the hips. The whole suit down to the knees was fitted with pocket-like protrusions. The helmet was , tightly bound to the trunk with pads and bands. Comical-looking hol­ lows appeared to be openings for built -in breathing or listening apparatus. I noti ced two more open ings on the lower half of the head. But the most fascinating thing about the figures was un­ doubt edly the large glasses with lenses set at an angle. I could not see any weapons, unl ess the short staff in the gloved left hand could be called a weapon. \"A min i-laser beam ,\" the aut hor of a science-fiction novel might say.

The students' desks and tables stood higgledy-piggledy wherever there was roo m. Empty tin cans served as ashtrays. On the walls there were gigantic astronomical maps, and in front of them, students arguing.

The room itself had the strange mixed smell of books, files and dust peculiar to rooms-as I have often not iced-in which the old is preserved and the new critically tested. Professor Shklovsky rose from behind his massive desk, which was covered with printed papers and manuscripts, and greeted me with a suspicious laugh : \"So you're the Swiss !\" It sounded like a rebuke, as if the gaunt old man really meant: \"So you're the man who upsets the subjects of that quiet, peaceful country with your shocking theori es.\" As a result, our conversa tion, carried on in English, began with a certain amount of reserve . Calmly, delibera te,ly, often look ing for the right word, the famous man-and he knows that he is famous -explained his Martian moon theory. He thinks that the two moons of our neighboring planet are artificial satellites. While he explained his ar­ guments in his favor of this theory, he would repeat in all modesty that it was only his private opinion. After lunch in the crowded canteen, Professor Shklov­ sky relaxed his suspi cious attitude a little. We began a lively argu ment about the impossible poss ibilities in the cosmos. In the end I had the satisf ac t ion of realizing that this leading expert of the Eastern world, too, does not ex­ clude the possib ility of a visit in the past by unknown in­ tell igences from the cosmos. He suspects that there are planets with intelligent life within a radius of a hund red light years. \"But what about the distances, Professor? How will the incalculable distances between the stars be bridged?\" Shklovsky ans wered unhesitatingly: \"Obviously there is no cut and dried answer to that.

My helpful friend Alexander Kassanzev was waiting for me in his old car. He had been talking to the students. The institute is like home to him. Now he wanted to take me to the Pushkin Mu seum, which houses magn ificent collections of Assyrian, Persian, Greek, and Roman art. En route we spoke about a fascinating piece of Chinese research which would have made a great imp ression on our archaeologists. As we drove along Prouzenskaya Quay, Kas sanzev told me many details of the latest conclusions Chinese scholars had reached and I spoke the key words into my portable tape recorder. When we stopped at traffic lights, as we did at Zoubovski Bou levard, I spelled out names and places clearly. The story I took home on tape was so exciting that it richly repaid the expense and efforts of the journey. Kassanzev mostly talked about the remarkable finds in the Chin ese mountains of Baian Kara Ula. His story sounded like a fairy tale. This is Kassanzev 's story : \"It was in 19 3 8 that the Chine se archaeologist Chi Pu Tei discovered graves arranged in rows in the mountain caves of Baian Kara Ula in the Sino-Tibetan border district. He found small skeletons of bei ngs- with delicate frames, who nevertheless had rather large skulls. On the walls of the caves he dis­ covered rock drawings which portrayed bei ngs with round helmets. The stars, sun, and moon were also scratched on the rock and connected by groups of pea-sized dots.

And anthropologists said of these mountain tribes that they had been of small stature, with an average height of only 5 feet 3 inches. . . .\" \"And how did they get the big skulls?\" \"It was that part of the discovery that upset all previous anth ropological classifications. Scholars could not place the high, broad skulls on the tiny skeletons of the Dropa and Kham. Not with the best will in the world. When Chi Pu Tei published his theory in 19 4 0, he met with nothing but scorn. He claimed that the Dropas and Khams must have been an extinct species of mountain ape.\" . \"Then how did the stone plates originate? Are the apes supposed to have made them?\" \"Of course not. In Chi Pu Tei's view they were placed in the caves by people from a later culture. On the face of it his theory did seem rather r.id iculous. Who ever heard of rows of graves made by apes?\" \"What happened next? Were the finds filed away in the archives of unexplaine d anthro pologico-archaeological cases and forg otten?\" \"Very nearly ! For twenty years several clever men racked their brains to solve the riddle of the stone plates. Not until 1962 was Prof essor Tsum Urn Nui of the Acadamy of Prehistoric Research in Peking able to de­ cipher parts of the inci sed sc ript.\" \"What did they say?\" Kassanzev became serious: \"The story that was de­ ciph ered was so hair-raising that at first the Academy for 28 9"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"Prehistoric Research forbade Tsum U m N i to publ ish his work at al l.\" . . And that was that?\" \"Tsum Um Nui is a stubborn fellow; he went on work­ ing dogg edly. He could prove without any doubt that the incised script was not just a bad practical joke by some authority on prehistoric writing. For even serious scholars often show a sense of humor. Think of Pilt down man. In coopera tion with geologists he showed that the stone plates had a high cobalt and metal content. Physicists found out that all seven hundred and sixteen plates had a high vibration rhythm, which led to the conclusion that they had been exposed to very high vol tages at some time.\" Kassanzev turned off from Kropotki nskaya Quay and drove to the curb of Volkhonka Street. The car stopped outside the Pushkin Mu seum. I was so entranced by his story that I wanted to hear the rest of it standing on the pav ement, but Kassanzev took me by the arm and led me into the museum. We sat on a bench between tall glass cases. \"Please go on!\" \"Tsum Urn Nu i now had four scientists who supported his theory. In 196 3 , he decided to publish it in spite of the Acad emy's doubts. I have heard that his publ ication was known to you in the West, but was not taken seriously. Over here, too, only a few courageous scholars took any notice of the stone-plate theory. Very recently our philol­ ogist Dr. Vyatcheslav Saizev publi shed extracts from the stone-plate story in the periodical Spu tnik. The whole story is preserved in the Peking Academy and the histori­ cal archives of Taipeh in Formosa .\" \"W hat is so explosive and shocking about the stone­ plate story?\" \"The story is only upsetting and bizarre to people who are unwilling to face things that may throw new light on our origin.

There had been no means and materials for building new aircraft .\" \"Is all that written on the stone plates?\" \"Yes, and then we are told that these beings who had crashed onto the earth had tried to make friends with the inhabitants of the mountains, but had been hunted down and killed. The story ends almost literally: 'Men, women, and children hid themselves in the caves until sunset. Then they bel ieved the sign and saw that the others had come with peaceful intenti ons this time. . . .' That's more or less how it ends.\" \"Is there anything else that corroborates the contents of the stone-plate stor y?\" \"There are the graves in rows, the rock drawings, and the plates themselves. And there are also the Chinese sagas which precisely in the Baian Kara VIa region tell of small spindly yellow beings who came down from the clouds. The myth goes on to say that the alien creatures were shunned by the Dropas because of their ugliness, indeed that they were killed by the men in \"the qui ck way.\" \"Kassanzev, why isn't this fasc inating story discussed all over the world? Is it really well enough known?\" My companion laughed, put his hand on my ann and said with mild resignation : \"He re in Mo scow the story is known, you only need to keep your e ars open.

On our journey in 1968, Hans Neuner and I planned to go ashore, free at least part of an arm from the sand, and take photographs. After an unsuccessful attempt to reach the three-armed trident by land in a rented car that kept on bogging down in the sand dunes, we persuaded a fisherman to take us into the bay. For a good two hours we swung along in a light breeze until the fisherman explained that he could go no nearer the coast because his boat would be in danger of being ripped apart by the sharp underwater reefs. So we had no choice but to get into the water and wade and swim the remaining fifty yards to the shore with all our clothes on, including our shoes-because of the sting­ ing ·fish. We pushed our tools, measuring tapes and cam­ eras ahead of us, wrapped in plastic containers. When we reached the first coastal cliffs, we took off our wet things and tramped through the hot sand to the cliff face. Unfortunately well-di sposed gods do not lend super­ natural powers to curious idealists. After a few hours of 29 3"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"hard work we had to admit that it was beyond our powers to free even a single bit of the trident from the hard layer of sand. Nevertheless, we took some accurate measurements that were worth our while. The individual arms of the trident .are about 12 feet 6 inches wide. They consist of snow­ white phosphorescent blocks that are as hard as gran ite. Before they were covered with sand, i.e., as long as the early inhabitants kept them clean, these dazzling, brilliant signals to the' \"gods\" must have shout ed to heaven. There are some archaeologists who think that the trident on the cliffs of the Bay of Pisco was a landmark intended for shipping. The fact that the trident lies in a bay and cannot be seen from all sides by passing ships is against this theory. Another argument against it is that a landmark of this size would have been excessively large for coastal shipping, and the existence of deep-sea ship­ ping in remote antiquity is doubtful, to say the least. But the main thing aga inst it is that the makers constructed their trident facing heavenward. We might also ask why, if navigational marks were needed for some kind of ship­ ping, the ancients did not make use of the two islands which lie far out at sea on the line of an extension of the central arm of the trid ent. They provided natural aids to orientation which would have been visible from afar to any ship regardless of the direction from which it ap­ proached the bay. So why a navigational mark that sea­ farers coming from either north or south could not see at all? And why one that points heavenward? I may mention in passi ng-to clinch mat ters-that apart from a sandy desert, there is absolutely nothing that could have at­ tracted seafarers and that the waters with their sharp reefs must have been an unsuit able anc horage even in prehis­ toric times.

At first they thought that the dead, straight lines were old Inca roads or irriga­ tion channels. Both explanations are nonsensic al! Why should roads begin in the middle of a plain and then suddenly come to a stop? If the lines were roads, why should they intersect in a system of coordinates?

At first they thought that the dead. straight lines were old Inca roads or irriga­ tion channels. Both explanations are nonse nsicall Why should roads begin in the middle of a plain and then suddenly come to a stop? If the lines were roads, why should they intersect in a system of coo rdinat es? And why are they laid out toward points of the compass when the purpose of roads is to reach earthly goals by the shortest possible route? And why should irrigation canals be in the form of birds, spiders. and snakes? Maria Reiche. who has worked the longest and most extensively on solving the secret of the Nazca plain and has written about it in her book Secret of the Desert, published in 1 9 68, rejects these interpretations. She thinks it much more likely that the drawings are connected with the calendar. besides having a religious meaning. In her view the ground markings are observations of the heavens meant to be handed down to posterity in an indestructible form. However, she makes the following reserv ation: \"It is not absolutely certain if it is possible to interpret all the 297"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"lines astronomic ally. for there are some (including many north-south lines) which could not have corresponded to any star appearing on the horizon during the period in question. But if it was intended to draw the position of constellations not only on but also above the horizon. there would be so many possible explanations of the lines that it would be extremely difficu lt to prove any of them.\" I know that Maria Reiche does not share my interpreta­ tion of the geometrical drawings at Nazca because the re­ sults of her investigations to date do not justify such dar­ ing conclusions. In spite of that I should like to be al­ lowed to expound my theory. At some time in the past. unkn own intelli gences landed on the uninhabit ed plain near the present-day town of Nazca and built an improvised airfield for their space­ craft which were to operate in the vicinity of the earth. They laid down two runways o n the ideal terrain. Or did they mark the landing strips with a raw material unknown to us? As on other occasions. the cosmonauts carried out their mission and returned to their own planet. But the pre-Inca tribes. who had observed these beings at work and been tremendously impressed by them. longed passionately for the return of these \"god s.\" They waited for years and when their wish was not fulfille d, they began to make new lines on the plain. just as they had seen the \"gods\" make them. That is how the extensions of the first two landing strips originated. Yet still the \"gods\" did not appear. What had gone wrong? How had they annoyed the \"heavenly ones?\" A priest remembered that the \"gods\" had come from the stars and advised them to lay the enticing lines out accord­ ing to the stars. The work began again and the tracks laid out according to the constellations came into being. But the \"gods\" still stayed away. In the interim. generations were born and died. The original. genuine strips made by the unknown cosmonauts 298"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"had long fallen into ruin. The Indian tribes who came after only knew of the \"gods\" who had once come down from heaven by oral accou nts. The priests turned the factual accounts into sacred traditions and made the peo­ ple constantly build new signs for the \"gods\" so that they might return one day. As this kind of lin ear conj uring was unsuccessful. they began to scratch large animal figures in the ground. At first they drew all kinds of birds that were supposed to symbolize flight, but later their imagination suggested outlines of spiders, apes and fish. Admitt edly that is a hypothetical explanation of the pictures at Nazca, but surely something like it could have happened. I have seen-and anyone else can see, t oo-- that the animal symbols and the coord inates of the landing strips are only recognizable from a great height. But that is not all. In the vicinity of Nazca, on the rock faces, are drawings of men with rays shooting out of their heads, rather like the gloriole in paintin gs of Christ. Nazca is a hundred miles as the crow flies from Pisco. Suddenly I had a brain wave. Was there some connection between the trident in the Bay of Pisco, the figures on the plain of Nazca, and the ruins on the plateau of Tiahua­ naco? Apart from a very slight deviation, they are joined by a straight line drawn on the map. But if the plain of Nazca was a landing ground and the trident at Pisco a landing signal, then there would have to be landmarks south of Nazca too, because one can hardly imagine that all the astron auts flew in from the north, i.e., from Pisco. And in fact, large markings, whose meaning and pur­ pose have not yet been explained, were found on high rock faces near the south Peruvian town of Mollendo, 2 5 0 miles as the crow flies from Nazca, and others continue into the deserts and mountains of the Chilean province of Antofagasta.

On August 26, 1 9 68, the Chilean newspaper El Mer­ curio wrote about its discovery (a little less than 5 00 miles south of Nazca) under the headline NEW ARCHAEOLOGI­ CAL DISCOVERIES BY AERIAL PHOTOGR APHY: A group of experts have succeeded in making a new archaeological discovery from the air. When they were flying over the desert of Tarapac;\\r, which lies in the ex­ treme north of Chile, they discovered the stylized figure of a man drawn in the sand. This figure is about 380 feet high, and its outline is marked with stones of volcanic origin. It is on a solitary hill about 650 feet high . . . Scientific circles are of the opinion that aerial searches of this kind are of great importanc e for the investigation of prehistory. Accord ing to the members of the expedition the robot is about 33 0 feet high. His body is rectangular, like a chest, his legs are straight and on the thin neck sits a square head from which twelve straight anten nae of equal length stick up. From hip to thigh triangular fins like the stubby wings of supersonic fighters are attached to the body on both sides. We owe this discovery to Lautaro Nunez of the Univer­ sity of the North in Chile, General Eduardo Jensen, and the American Delbert Trou, who observed the ground formations closely during a flight over the desert.

The rock­ strewn plateau is about 2 miles long and at the place undestroyed by the passage of time about 870 yards wide. This terrain looks rather like an amphi theater. If its builders were men, they must have possessed the legendary superhuman strength. The stone blocks that have been moved here are rectangular. 12. to 16 feet high and 20 to �o feet long. If giants lived here. they must still have been exceptionally big. Judging by the stone chairs, their shin­ bones must have been 1 3 feet long. No fantasy is rich enough to imagine what kind of mortals could have as­ sembled these blocks to form an amphi theater. The news­ paper La Manana of Talca, Chile, asked: \"Could this place have been a landing ground [for gods]? Undoubtedly it could .\" What more can one want? The plateau of El Enladrilla do can only be reached on horseback. You ride for three hours from the little village of Orto Alto de Viches to the rewarding goal at a height of I ,�78 feet.

Over towards the western hills there is a 3 0o-foot-deep natural cave in which traces of work done by human hands are still discern ible. At present scholars toy with the idea that Stone Age men excavated a vein of obsidi an-a glasslike formation of various re­ cent lava deposits-in order to leave behind a sample of their industrial abilities in the form of tools containing metal. I cannot quite go along with this. Stone Age men would hardly have had tools containing metal. I think that the present theory cannot be correct. During archaeological and geological investigations, scholars found a fallen monolith, which even on its side rose 6 feet from the ground. When they had turned it over with great effort, they found several faces on the other side. A puzzle worthy of inclusion in the forest of ques­ tions surrounding Easter Island. One other remarkable find deserves to be menti oned. In the middle of the plateau stand three boulders with a diameter of 3 feet to 4 feet 6 inches. When taking measure­ ments at the beginning of last year, it was discovered that two of these boulder s are in accurate compass line from north to south. With a minimal deviation the line that runs from the first two boulders to the third cuts the hori­ zon at the point where the sun is at its zenith in summer.

But. said Bounaud, somebody already knew that the plateau would make a first-class landing gro und for all kinds of flying bodies. That would explain the 2 33 symmetrically arranged stone blocks which could have been visual signs directed skyward. Bounaud also writes : \"Or the explanation may quite simply be that unknown beings used this place for their own ends.\" I have gone into the most recent finds on the plateau of El Enl adrillado in such detail for two reasons. Firstly . because they are only known in Europe to a comparatively small circle of specialists and. secondly, because they fit so splendidly into my theory .that the markings in the Bay of Pisco were the beginning of a straight line along which landing grounds for the cosmonauts were laid out right up to the far north of Chile.

Twelve miles south of the Spanish town of Ronda, in a solit ary mountain valley, lies the cave of La Pileta. It can be proved that men lived in this cave from 3 0,000 to 6000 B.C. The cave walls are covered with strange, styl ized signs that are not just senseless scribbles, for they are executed in a masterly fashion and are often repeated. They might be a kind of writing.

He and two of his assistants offered to act as our guides. The language of the Rapanui is rich in vowels: ti- ta-pe­ pe-tu-ti-lo-mu. I do not speak it, so we conversed in a mixture of Spanish and English. When that failed, we tried to make ourselves understood with hands, feet and grimaces that must have been extremely funny to out­ siders. There are many accounts of the history of Easter Island and just as many theories about it. After my ten days' researches I naturally cannot say what took place here in the remote past, but I believe I found some arguments to show what ca nnot have taken place. There is one theory that the ancestors of the present­ day Rapanui chiseled the now world-famous statues from the hard volcanic rock during generations of arduous toil. Thor Heyerda hl, whom I respect highly, describes in his book Ak u-A ku how he found hund reds of stone imple­ ments lying about in confusion in the quarries. From this mass find of primitive tools, Heyerdahl concluded that an unknown number of men chiseled the statues here and then precipitately abandoned their work at some time or other. They threw down their tools and left them lying where they had been working. Using a large number of islanders who worked for eighteen days, Heyerdahl erected a medium-si zed statue by means of wooden beams and a primiti ve but successful technique, and then moved it with the help of ropes and about a hundred men on the heave-ho principle. Here a theory appeared to be proved in practice ! Never- 3 08"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"theless, archaeologists all over the world protested against this example. For one thing, they said, Easter Island had always been too short of men and food to have provided the necessary numb er of stonemasons to carry out the enormous task--eve n over many generations. For another, they claimed that no finds had yet supplied proof that the islanders had ever had wood at their disposal as building material (for rollers) . After my own reflections on the spot, I think I may say that the stone-tool theory will not stand up for long in view of the facts, which are hard in the literal sense of the word . After Heyerdahl's successful experi ment, I was quite prepared to cross an unsolved puzzle off my list as solved. But\" when I stood in front of the lava wall in the crater Rano Raraku, I decided to let the questi on mark stay on my list. I measured the distance hacked away be­ tween the lava and individual statues, and found spaces of up to 6 feet over a distance of nearly 105 feet. Nobody could ever have freed such gigantic lumps of lava with small, primitive stone tools. Thor Heyerdahl made the natives hammer away for weeks with the old implements which were found in abundance. I saw the meager result: a groove of a few inches in the hard volcanic rock I We, too, bashed away at the rock like wild men, using the biggest stones we could find. After a few hundred blows, there was nothing left of our tools but a few miserable splint ers, but the rock showed hardly a scratch. The stone-tool theory may be valid for some of the smaller statues which originated in an age nearer our own, but in my conviction and the opini on of many visitors to Easter Island it can in no case be accepted for the excava­ tion of the raw material for the colossal statues from the volcanic stone.

With a sly look on his face, he said drily: \"So the archaeologists say.\" So far no one has been able to produce even a tolerably convincing reason why a few hundred Polynesians who found it hard enough to win their scanty nourishment took such pains to carve some six hun dred statues. No one has been able to give a clue as to the highly advanced techniques with which the stone blocks were freed from the hard lava. So far no one has been able to explain why the Poly­ nesia ns-if they were the sculpt ors-endowed the faces with shapes and expressions for which there was no model on the island: long, straight noses, narrow-lipped mouths, sunken eyes and low foreheads.

Life on the little island be­ came boring and monotonous. The unknowns began to teach the natives the elements of. spee ch; they told them about foreign worlds, stars and suns. Perhaps to leave the natives a lasting memory of their stay, but perhaps also as a sign to the friends who were looking for them, the stran­ gers extracted a colossal statue from the volcanic stone.

People may doubt my theory, but they must admit that it looks as if it had been child's play for the original sculpt ors to cut the stone colossi from the hard rock. Perhaps it was only a spare-time activity for them. But perhaps they had a very specific purp ose in mind. Did they get bored with the statue game one day? Or did they get an order that compelled them to stop? At all events they sud � enly disappeared. So far no deep excavations have been made.

The red hats themselves, which are brittle and porous, also make me skeptical. Were they cut out and carved here at all? I incline to the assumption that the red hats were cast from a mixture of gravel and red earth. Many hats are hollow inside. Did their sculpt ors want to save weight to make transport easier? Anyone who accepts the method of making the hats by a cast of grave l and earth-and it sounds reasonab le-s imu ltaneously has the baffling trans­ port problem solved. The round hats must simply have been rolled from the gravel pit to the sites of the statues, which were always situat ed lower down. When we discussed this poss ibil ity, Ma yor Ropo thought that the hats must have been much larger when they were made in the gI'a vel pit because they would have lost a lot by abrasion when they were rolled down. That may be so, but even today the hats are a respectable size, with a circumf erence of 2 5 feet and a height of 7 feet 2 inches. It must still have been quit e a feat to put such headgear on the heads towering 33 feet above the ground. But why were the red hats put on the strang e statues at all? So far, I have not found a convincing explanation in the whole of the literature about Easter Island. So I ask myself the following questions : Had the islanders seen \"gods\" with helmets and re­ member ed the fact when it came to making the statues? Was that the reason why the statues did not seem com­ plete to them without the hat-helmets? Are they meant to express the same thing that helmets and halos express on prehistoric cliffs and cave walls all over the world?

Letters and inexplicable symbols are also found on the petroglyphs, the large flat stones with writing and draw­ ings that lie scattered about on the beach like carpets. Many of these torn and fissured stones have surface areas of 2 4 square yards. They lie about wherever the ground is reasonably level. On them we found fish, indefinable embryonic beings, sun symbols, balls and stars. To make the drawings clearer to us, Mayor Ropo went over the lines with chalk. I asked him if anyone knew how to interpret the signs. No, he said ; even his father and grandfather had not been able to tell him anything about them. He himself thought that the petroglyphs contained astronomical data. He said that all the temples on the island had also been aligned according to the sun and the constellations. Then our excursion to Easter Island paid a special dividend. Mayor Ropo took us to the beach and showed us a stone egg of astonishing propo rtions. While we walked round the stone relic, he explained that in Rapanui tradi­ tion this egg had originally lain in the center of the Temple of the Sun, for the \"gods\" had come to them from an egg.

Often I heard an ang el's voice and once I caught the wor ds: 'Fli ght 101 to New York--gate 12.' \"Then a cherub took me by the hand and led me to a seraph who was very kind to me and gave me a small piece of paper and said, 'Your ticket .' I could not decipher the divine writing on it. And then the cherub stood next to me again and led me to a big gleaming, heavenly bird which stood on a large smooth area in the vast park of the heavenly beasts. The heavenly bird rested on eight black wheels that protruded from the metal belly of the motion­ less monster like calves' feet and seemed to be of tanned leather. The gig antic wings of the gleaming heavenly crea­ ture were spread wide. Everyone awaited the god who was to fly with us and whom my cherub called the pilot. \"As I climb ed the silver ladder to the bird, I saw on the 3 1 5"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"wings four great boxes, each of which had a large hole in it. And I saw that many wheels turned in one of these holes. The heavenly bird obviously bel onged to the god Swissair, for a brightly shining wall spoke this name often. \"In the belly of the bird of the god, the air was filled with the sound of harps and a pleasing smell of jasmine rose to my nostrils. Now another cherub with an incom­ parably lovely figure carne and put me in a throne and fastened a broad band tightly round my waist. The harp music died away; a god's voice announced: 'Please stop smoking and fasten your seat belts.' The voice proclaimed many more prophecies which I unders tood as little as I had und erstood everything else that had been said. Sud­ denly a terrible noise, like the roaring and thun dering of a violent stonn, was heard. The bird shuddered, started to move and roared away from the other diving birds faster than the fleeing leopard. And it rushed away faster and faster, mighty as the surge of the sea, strong as the sons of our first mother the Sun. Fear oppressed my breast like a tight-fitting red-hot band. My senses swam. . \"Then the charming cherub stood beside me aga in, handed me intoxicating divine nectar, raised her hand and opened a sluice above me. A refr eshing celestial wind blew in my face. Now I raised my eyes and,.lo, from out of the belly of · the divine bird I could see the wings which were motionless and did not move like the flapping of birds' wings. Below me I caught sight of water and clouds and a jumble of green and brown in strange jagged shapes. I felt very distur bed and I gave a start. Then the cherub stood beside me yet again and made known to me the wis dom of the heavenly one: 'B e not afraid, no one has ever stayed up her e.' \" I have just recoun ted a plane jour ney as it might have been told by one of our remote ancest ors if he had flown from Zurich to New York in a modern jet aircraft.

The prophet Ezekiel 10: 1-1 9 gives an account that suggests a definite assoc iati on of ideas after my imagina­ tive attempt to reproduce an ancestor's story of a journey by plane: Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared. over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne. And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill thine hand with coals of fire ... And he went in in my sight. Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court. Then the glory of the Lord went up from the cherub, and stood over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of th e brightness of the Lord's glory . And the sound of the cherubims' wings was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh. And it came to pass, that when he had commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubims; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels.

The International Academy for Sanskrit Research in Mysore.

The result that lay before me in black and wh ite was so astounding that during my journey to India in the autumn of 1 9 68, I had the accuracy of the transla­ tion checked both in M ysore and at the Central Col lege of Bangalore. This is how the modern translation of an ancient Sanskrit text reads : 6.

Later on in the text the thirty-one main pieces of which the machine consists are accurately described. It also enumerates sixteen kinds of metal that are needed to con­ struct the flying vehicle, but only three of them are known to us today. All the others have remain ed untranslatable to date. The experiment that was made in M ysore with this text, the age of which is still unknown, should be set up as an example of what old texts am express in modern translation. A curiosity that leaves me no rest has always drawn me to the old Indian source books. What a mass of fascinating and mysterious information about flying machines and fantastic weapons in the remote past can be found in the translations of the Indian Vedas and epics. The Old Testa­ ment with its vigorous, vivid descriptions pales beside these Indian jewels. My curiosity about the original sources became even greater owing to a purely chance encounter. After a lec­ ture which I had given to a small circle in Zurich in 1 9 6�, an Indian student came up to me and said with disarming candor : \"Do you really find anything new or shocking about what you have told us? Every half-educated Indian knows the main sections of the Vedas and so knows that the gods in ancient times moved about in flying machines and possessed terrible weapons. Really, every child in India knows thatl\" Basically, the nice young man only wanted to confirm 3 1 9"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"my theory, and perhaps to calm me down as well, for I get easily excited about my pet subject. He achieved exactly the opposite effect. In the years that followed, I carried on a rather one­ sided correspondence with Indian Sanskrit scholars. They answered my specific questions very politely and sent me photostats of Sanskrit texts that I could not read. The only people who profited by my obsession were my stamp­ collecting friends. There was no peace left for me. I had to go to India-because of the texts. In the autumn of 1 9 68 I flew to Bangalore, the capital of the southern state of Mysore. Bangalore is the educa­ tional center of southern India. Yet at first I did not no­ tice this at all. On the first day of my arrival a kaleido­ scope of bewildering impressions passed before my eyes. Beggars and starvation existence ...,.......Qxcarts and moped taxis-women with diamonds in their noses and a red spot on their forehea ds-d ilapidated wooden huts and white palaces in the English colonial style-bustle in the streets and gaunt holy cows with red eyes-sol diers in bluish- green uniforms and dirty-yellow water at the edges of the streets, and above all, the peculi ar smell which seemed to penetrate right into my brain. The University of Bangalore, which benefits from overseas aid, is magnificently equipped and full of for­ ward-looking intellects. Professors and students work to­ gether on solving new scientific problems. Specialist professors of Sanskrit such as Ramesh J. Patel from the Cultural Center at Kochrab and T. S. Nandi from the University of Ahmedabad gave me their valu­ able time. Generally a single phone call was enough to fix the time and place for a conversation. I asked about the age of the Vedas and epics. Scholars were unanimous in telling me that the Mahabharata, the national epic of the Indians with more than 80,000 cou­ plets, must have originated in its first establis hed form 3 20"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"about 1,500 B.C. But when I inquired about the original core of the epic, the answers were either 7016 or 2604 B.C. The unusual precision for datings lying so far back in the past was due to specific astronomic constellations men­ tioned in connect ion with a battle described in the Maha­ bharata. In spite of these astronomical data, the specialists have not yet agreed on the age of the epic. As with the Old Testament, the original author of the Mahabharata is unknown. It is suspected that a legendary figure, Vyasa, was the original creator, but it is said with considerable assurance that the last oral narrator, Sauti, also prepared the first complete written version. For the benefit of the mathematicians who will have to feed their computers with data to find out the time dila­ tion on interstellar flights, I may mention two numbe rs that I noted in Bangalore. In the Mahabh arata 1,200 di­ vine years equal 3 60,800 human years ! How furious I was that I could not read Sanskrit I Everyone was most helpful; I was told exactly in which texts and in which passages I should find the super­ weapons, flying weapons and flying machines I was look­ ing for. People got on the phone and warned librarians of my imminent arrival and the texts I wished to see; they gave me willing students to accompany me and make sure I found exactly what I wanted. And then when I expec­ tantly held the answer to my questions in my hands, the essential thing was written in Sanskrit or some other In­ dian language. Disappoint ed by the meager results, I de­ cided to keep up the contacts I had made and return one day a wiser man. I still had hopes that one authority would be able to satisfy my curiosity by telling me about the texts in greater detail. I had corr esponded from Switzerland with Professor T. S. Nandi, Sanskrit scholar in the University of Ahmedabad. I consulted him in India and through him I met Professor Esther Abraham Solomon, who is his 3 21"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"chief. She has a vast knowledge of Sanskrit. She has been head of the Sanskrit Department for six years and scholars throughout India look up to her as one of the greatest experts on the subject. Ahmedabad is an old cotton town with many impor­ tant mosques and tombs from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. It lies right on the River Sarbarmatic, has more than 1,200,000 inhabitants and today is famous for the University of Gujerat founded in 1 9 61. Ahmedabad has a special tourist attraction, the Shak­ ing Towers. They are the two tall minarets of a mosque, massively built and climbable inside by a spiral staircase right to the top--barefoot, of course. These towers have a pecul iarity that is unique in the world. If a small group of people sets one tower in motion by a rhythmical to-and­ fro movement, the other tower begins to swing too. So far the towers have easily stood up to these constant tourist antics and they look as if they will survive the leaning tower of Pisa. Professor Nandi had arranged for me to meet Professor Esther Solomon at noon and told me: \"Go up to the first floor; her name is on the door, go in and make yourself comforta ble.\" I set off in the blazing midday sun-it was November. The university was a modem, functional two-story lime­ stone building with no unnecessary external trimmings. I waited in the vestibule. To a European the encourage­ ment \"Go in and make yourself comfo rtable\" is very un­ usual. While I was waiting, I watched professors and stu­ dents going into the various offices without knocking as if it were the most natural thing · in the world and ob­ served how politely and informally they mixed with each other. Professor Solomon arrived about one o'clock. She had been kept at a seminar. She wore a simple white sari. I estimated her age at about fifty. She greeted me like an 3 22"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"old friend, obviously because Professor Nandi had told her about me. We carried on our conversation in English and she allowed me to tape it on my portable tape re­ corde r. This was our conversa tion: \"Professor, am I interpret­ ing the information of your colleagues correctly if I say that Sanskrit scholars consider the old Indian Vedas and epics to be older than the Old Testament?\" \"We cannot and should not make such absolute claims. Neither the ancient Indian texts nor those of the Old Testament can be dated exactly. Although we are inclin­ ing more and more to date the oldest parts of the Maha­ bharata to around 1 5 00 B.C., it is a very cautious estimate and an assumpti on that refers to the oldest, central core of the epic. Naturally there were many additions and elab­ orations that were not made until 'A.D.' Even today exact datings must still be made with reserva tions. The original nucleus of the Mahabharata may well be a hundred and more years older than 1 5 00 B.C. You kno w that the oldest texts were written on the bark of palm trees; yet before these palm texts originated, the texts had already been handed down orally for many generations. There are also inscriptions on stone, but they are comparatively rare in India .\" \"In your work have you come across parallels between the texts of the Old Testament and the original Indian texts?\" \"Undoubtedly there are some parallels, but in my opinion these similarities can be observed in some form or other in most peoples' legends. You have only to think of an event like the Flood or the story of the gods who cre­ ated men, or the heroes who were snatched up to heaven, or the constant references to the weapons they used.\" \"But it is the old Indian and Tibetan texts in particu­ lar that teem with science-fiction weapons. I am thinking of the divine lightning and ray weapons, of a kind of hyp- 3 2 3"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"notic weapon, like the one menti oned in the Mahabha­ rata, and of the discus which the gods threw and which al­ ways returned to them like a boomerang, and of the texts that seem to be referring to bacteriological weapons. What do you think about them?\" \"They are just exagge rations of fanciful descriptions of an imagina ry divine power. The ancients undoubtedly felt the need to endow their leaders and kings with a mys­ tical, mysterious nimbus. They certainly invented the in­ credible and invul nerable attributes later-m ultiplying them with each new gener ation .\" \"Can\" these fantastic conceptions be recon ciled with the world of ideas of primiti ve times?\" \"Obviously. But we ourselves are always being con­ fronted with puzzles '\" \"Flying objects called Vimanas are continually being described in Indian and Tibetan texts. What do you think about them?\" \"To be quite honest, I don't know what to make of them. The descriptions obviously mean something like airplanes, in which the gods fought in the sky.\" \"Then can we or should we simply classif y these tradi­ tions as myths and dispose of them like that?\" Professor Solomon thought for a moment before she answered, almost with resignation : \"Yes, we should.\" \"And supposing these texts were descriptions of very remote real events?\" \"That would be fantastic !\" \"But would it be impossible?\" After a pause : \"I don't know. I really don't know.\" Outside, I was assailed again by the intolerable heat. I strolled slowly back to the town over a bridge that seemed to be needless. The river had dried up to a narrow stream. Carpetmakers had laid out their colorfu l products 3 2 4"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"to dry in the riverbed as far as the eye could see. Again and again I tried to recapitulate the conver sation. Even this highly intelli gent woman could not give a satisfactory answer to my questions. But it is precisely what Professor Solomon could not clearly confirm that has driven me for more than a decade to compare the oldest books of mankind with my theory in mind and to track down parallels in descriptions of spe­ cific events. Back in my hotel, the air conditioning in my room put some life into me again. I opened the Mahabh arata at random and came across this passage : Brighu, asked about the dimensions of the tent of the sky, answered: \"Infinite is that space inhabit ed by the blessed and the divinities, delightful it is, studded with many dwell ings, and its boundary is unattainable. \"Above its sphere of power and below , the sun and moon are no-longer seen, there the gods are their own light, shining like the sun and flashing like fire. \"And even they do not see the boundary of the mighty outsp read tent of the heavens, because this is hard to re a ch, because it is i n finite ... But upwards and ever upwards that universe that cannot even be measured by the gods is filled with flaming, self-illuminating beings. The accounts in the Mahab harata still belong to the unsolved riddles of the past, even in India where this an­ cient text is subjected to the most minut e and even pe­ dantic scholarly scrutiny. Ever since man has been able to think and use lan­ guage , he has invented myths and legends, which, after being told for millennia, have been written down at some point in time. It is puzzling why some of these old tradi­ tions became religions or basic philosophies governing mankind's action and others were rejected and remained 3 2 5"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"without influence. A common feature of all ancient tradi­ tions is that their contents are not demonstrable, and that those which have been elevated to religions are bel ieved. When we try to interpret old texts from new standpoints today, no new versions are available to us, so we have only the old belie ved or rejected texts to go on . Nevertheless, they provide us with startling informa tion. But appar­ ently it is not done to call traditionally bel ieved dogma in question or to take mythical accounts as reports of real events. \\ In the library of the Sorbonne in Paris, I buri ed myself in the complete seven-volume edition of the Cabbala. Be­ fore I describe the fruits of my read ing, I must say briefly that the Cabbala is certainly the most comprehensive and puzzling secret doctrine in the world. A start on writing it down is supp osed to have been made around 12 00 A.D. It is also said that it originated as a reaction against the realism and materialism of the Talmud. The Cabbala interprets mysterious pronouncements in the Old Testament and comments for a circle of initi ates on the encoded mess ages in old Jewish laws. The cab­ balists say that the book was written down at God 's com­ mand. It contains secret signs, symbols, and mathematical form ulae, and links all occult data with the mystical powe ,r of various gods. Those who belong to the small cir­ cle of initi ates and have fully mast ered the secrets of the Cabbala are supposed to be given the power to perform mir acles. Just as I am in the habit of considering the descriptions in other ancient texts as real, I have also taken the stories in the Cabbala as factual accounts written down after the event. It is the only way to penetrate the occult ideas of the Cabbala and find a real trace that leads from our earth to the \"gods .\" The \"seven other worlds\" of the Cabbala, with their inhabit ants , are described in great detail in a number of 3 26"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"passag es. Here are some extracts of which I reproduce the general sense: The inhabi tants of the world of Geh sow and plant trees. They eat every thing from trees, but know no wheat or any kind of cerea l. Their world is shadowy and there are many large animals in it. The inhabitant s of the world of Nesziah eat shrubs and plants, which they do not have to sow. They are small in stature and instead of noses have two holes in their heads through which they breathe. They are very forge tful and when doing a job of work often do not know why they began it. A red sun is seen in their world. The inhabitants of the world of Tziah must not eat what other beings eat. They constantly seek for under­ ground wa tercourses. They are very fair of face and have more faith than all other beings. There are great riches and many hands ome buildin gs in their world. The ground is dry and two suns are visible. The inhabi tants of the world of Thebel eat every thing from the water. They are superior to all other bei ngs and their world is divided into zones in which the inhabit ant s diff er facially and in color. They make their dead to live again. The world is far away from the sun. The inhabitants of the world of Erez are descendants of Adam. The inhabitants of Adamah are also the descendants of Adam because Adam complained of the cheerlessness of Erez. They cultivat e the earth and eat plants, animals and bread. They are mostly sad and often make war on each other. There are days in this world and the groupings of the const ell ations are visible. In the past they were often visit ed by the inhabitants of the world of Thebel, but the visi tors were stricken with failing memories on Adamah and no longer knew whence they came. The inhabitants of the world of Arqa sow and harvest. Their faces are diff erent from our faces. They visit all worlds and speak all lan guages. 3 27"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"Once again the old familiar questions arise. How did the authors of the Cabbala know that the beings in the seven other worlds had a different appearance from the citizens of earth? How did they know that they ate differ­ ent food and knew other suns in the sky? It is also worth mentioning the statement in the Cab­ bala that originally human beings did not look each other in the face during the sexual act and that the union of the seeds took place in a si ngle being .. Modern Cabbal ists claim that. before Adam. God created another being who was man only. a characteristic that did not prevent this being from producing childr en. who later mated with the snake. The main work of the Cabbala. the Book Zohar. is writ­ ten in Aramaic and interprets the Pentateuch from the standpoint of the cabbalistic conception of God. The Zohar is considered to be the work of Rabbi Simon bar Yochai (A.D. 1 3 0-7°) . but was probably first written down from oral traditions by Moses de Leon in Spain at the end of the thirteenth centur y and first printed in Cremona in 1 55 8 .. In the Zohar-and this is astounding -a conversation between an earth man and someone stranded from the world of Arqa is given. In this dialogue we learn that after the earth had been destroyed by fire. some refu­ gees, who had survived the catastrophe and were led by Rabbi Yosse, met a stranger who suddenly emerged from a crack in the rock and had \"a different face.\" Rabbi Yosse went up to the stranger and asked where he came from. The stranger answer ed: \"I am an inhabitant of Arqa .\" The refugee was surprised and asked: \"You mean there are living creatures on Arqa?\" The stranger replied: \"Yes. When I saw you coming, I climbed out of the 3 28"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"cave in order to learn the name of the world on which I had arrived .\" And then the stranger said that in his world the seasons were not the same as in their country ; there sowing and harvest would only recommence after several years ; the arrange ment of the constellations was also different from the way it looked on earth. . . . Nearly 1 ,800 years of oral tradition stand behind this account, which was not written down until about 700 years ago and only printed for the first time 4 00 years ago. But once again I have to ask what ancient knowledge was hidden behind these words . Naturally a stranger who visited the earth saw the con­ stellations from a different point of view from the one he was used to on his own planet, which also had its seasons in a different sequence from the earth . The statements are basically too realistic to be brushed aside as pure fantasy. Then we have the Book of Dzyan with its sacred sym­ bolic signs. No one in the world knows its real age. It is said that the original is older than the earth. It is also said that it was so strongly magnetized that the elect who took it in their hands saw the events described pass before their eyes and at the same moment they could understand the mysterious texts through rhythmically transmitted impulses, provided their language had an adequate vo­ cabulary. For thousands of years this esoteric doctrine was guarded as top secret in Tibetan crypts. It was said that the secret teaching could be tremendously dangerous in the hands of ignorant people. The original text-it is not known if it still exists somewh ere-was copied word for word from generation to generation and ampli fied by the elect with new accounts and new knowledge they had acquired. The Book of Dzyan is supposed to have originated be- 3 2 9"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"yond the Himalayas. By unknown routes its teaching reached Japan, India, and China, and traces of its ideas are even found in South American traditions. Secret fra­ ternities, who hid themselves in the solitary passes of the west Chinese Kun-Iun range or in the deep gorges of Altyn-t ag, situated also in the western part of present-day Red China, watched over collections of books of vast size. They lived in miserable temples. Subterranean vaults and passages concealed their literary treasures. The Book of Dzyan was also guarded in these fastnesses. The first fathers of the church made every effort to erase this secret doctrine from the memories of those who were familiar with it. Yet all their efforts failed and the texts were trans­ mitted orally from generation to genera tion. I have often been told about this teaching in foreign countries, but I have never met anyone who had seen a genuine copy of the book. Parts of the Book of Dzyan that have been preserved or, more accurate ly, become known, circulate through the world in thousands of texts trans­ lated into Sanskrit. By all accounts this remarkable secret doctrine is supposed to contain the primordial ancient word, the formula of creation, and to tell of the evolution of mankind over millions of years. The seven stanzas of the creation according to the Book of Dzyan are so interesting that I shall quote extracts from them here: Stanza I Time was not, for it lay sleeping in the infinite bosom of duration . . .

It is uncanny how these texts really interpret themselves in the age of space travel. Only a few concepts need enlarging on. The eternal mother = space. Seven eternities = aeons or periods. Eternity in the sense of Christian theolo gy is meaning less in Asian ideol· 33 2"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"ogy. An aeon extends over a great period of time, i.e., 100 years of Brahma or 3 I 1,0 4 0,000,000,000 terrestrial years. A day of Brahma consists of 4 , 3 20,000,000 years for mortal. Brahma is the force that creates and preserves all worlds. May I remind readers of the laws of time dilation without which these measurements of time are Incon­ ceivable. Time = succession of states of consciousness. Space = matter. Light = something unimaginable because its source is unknown. Father and mother = male and female principle of primordial nature. Seven sublime lords = seven creative spirits. Builders = the real creators of the universe , or archi- tects of the planet ary system. Breath = dimensi onless space. Ray = matter in the world egg.

(Quotations and exegesis are taken from The Secret Doctrine by Helene Petrovna Blavatsky, published in Germany in 18881) Other sections of the Book of Dzyan reputedly tell us that 18,000,000 years ago there were living creatures on earth that were boneless and rubberlike, and vegetated without reason or intelli gence. These beings are sup­ posed to have reproduced themselves by division. On the course of a long evolution, a peaceful and gentle kind of being originated in this way 4 ,000,000 years ago.

These giants, it says in Dzyan, were androgynous and mated with themselves.

These monsters were unable to free themselves from this bestial method of reproduction and became dependent on animals and dumblike animals.

The literature and art of antiquity leaves no doubt about that. Pictures of winged beasts with human heads, mermaids, scorpion men, birdm en, centaurs, and many-headed monsters are all vividly in our memory. Old books say that even in historical times these hybrid beings lived together in hordes, tribes, and even in larger units like peoples. They tell of specially bred hybrids who spent their existence as temple animals and seem to have been the spoiled darlings of the populace. The Sumerian kings and later the Assyrians hunted half men, half ani­ mals-p ossibly just for diversion. Mysterious texts refer to half humans and hybrids, whose remarkable existence constantly evaporates into the uncheckable realms of the mythical. The Egyptian ram still haunts the stories of the Orders of Knights Templar founded in the twelfth century. He is depicted walking upright, with human hair on his head, goat's feet, goat's hind parts, and a large phallus.

I also have very little doubt that the dance around the golden calf was the climax of a sexual orgy. Plato writes in his Sy mpo sium : \"Originally there was a third sex in addition to the male and female sexes. This human had four hands and four feet . . . great was the strength of these humans, their minds were presumptu­ ous, they planned to storm heaven and to lay violent hands on the gods . . .\" The Cabeiri, mostly called the great gods in inscrip­ tions, carried on a mysterious cult with fertility demons, which continued from ancient Egyptian times through the Hellenistic period and down to the flowering of the Roman culture. As the Cabeiri's rites were secr et, it has not yet been possible to find out what sort of hearty sex games the ladies and gentlemen played with one another. Nevertheless, it is certain that two male and two female Cabeiri, as well as an animal, always took part in these diversions. The man and woman were not the only ones to copulate, the animal played an active role, tool Perhaps I also ought to mention in this connection the Egyptian bulls of Apis, the \"sacred bulls of Memphis.\" Because of their fertility they were mummified in sar­ cophagi over 9 feet long and 1 2 feet high. Three years ago I stood in some of these musty burial chambers deep be­ low the sands of the desert and asked myself what these fertile animals had done in their lifetime.

The god Pan was depicted with goat's feet and a goat's head by classical artists. That, too, upset Herodotus (II, 4 6) : \"But that is how they paint him, why, I should pre­ fer not to mention .\" The Jewish Talmud recounts that Eve coupled with a snake.

Distressing as it is, the sinful side of our past cannot be wiped out. Pornography has been a sought after stimu­ lant in all ages. Prehistoric pictures of sexual excesses on clay tablets, rock faces, and animal bones speak for them­ selves. Strange half-human, half-animal beings can be made out on the relief s on the black obelisk of Salmanasar II in the British Museum. In the Louvre, the Museum of Baghd ad, and elsewhere there are pictures of remarkable coupli ngs between animals and humans. Large stone fig­ ures with an extraord inary anatomy exist on the island of Malta. They have globular thighs and pointed feet; they cannot be defined sexually at all.

Such mating has never produced a viable being. But do we know the genetic code accor ding to which the chromosome count of the mixed being s was put together? The sexual human-animal cult which was practiced with gusto and enjoyment by the people of antiquity seems to me to have been celebrated against their better judgment. Cannot the better judgment of coupling with one's own kind have come only hom unknown intelli­ gences? Did the earth's inhabitants lapse after the \"gods\" had left? And was this lapse the same thing as original sin? Did they perhaps fear the day when the \"gods\" would return because of their backslid ing? The factor that im­ peded evolution in primiti ve times was probably inter­ breeding with animals. From this point of view the Fall was simply arrested or recessive evolution owing to ad­ mixture with bestial blood. Original sin only becomes logical if at each birth something of the former animal side is inherited: the bestial in man. What other kind of sin was there to inherit, for heav­ en's sake? The Sumerians had one single concept for the uni­ verse : an-hi, which can be roughly translated as \"heaven and earth.\" Their myths tell of \"gods\" who drove through the sky in barks and fire ships, descended hom the stars, fertilized their ancestors, and then returned to the stars again. The Sumerian pantheon, the shrine of the gods, was animated by a group of beings who possessed fairly recogn izable human shape, but appear to have been superhuman, indeed immortal. But the Sumerian texts do not refer to their \"gods\" with vague imprecision ; they 33 8"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"say quite clearly that the people had once seen them with their own eyes. Their sages were convinced that they had known the \"gods\" who completed the work of instruc­ tion. We can read in Sumerian texts how every thing hap­ pened. The gods gave them writing, they gave them in­ structions for making metal (the translation of the Su­ merian word for metal is \"heavenly metal\") and taught them how to cultivate barley. We should also note that accord ing to Sumerian records the first men are supposed to have resulted from the interbreeding of gods and the children of earth. Sumerian tradition says that the sun god Utu and the goddess of Venus, Inanna (at least) , came from the uni­ verse. The Sumerian word for \"rib\" is ti; ti also means \"to create life.\" Ninti is also the name of the Sumerian goddess who creates life. Tradition has it that Enlil, the god of the air, made many humans pregna nt. A cunei­ fonn tablet says that Enlil discharged his seed into the womb of Meslamtaea : \"The seed of thy lord, the gleam­ ing seed, is in thy womb; the seed of Sin, the divine name, is in my womb ... \" Before men were created and only gods dwelled in the town of Nippur, Enlil raped the delightful Ninlil and made her pregnant on orders from above. At first the lovely child of earth, N inlil, was unwilling to be fertilized by a \"god.\" The cuneif orm text from Ninlil's fear of the act of violation : \"My vagina is too small, it does not un­ derstand intercourse. My lips are too small, they do not understand how to kiss. . . .\" The divine Enlil overheard Ninlil's words of refusal, but it was a decision of the \"gods\" to wipe the loathesome brood of unclean beings from the face of the earth and so Enlil discharged into Ninlil's womb. On one of the tab­ lets translated by the Sumerologist S. N. Kramer we read: \"In order to destroy the seed of mankind the decision of the council of the gods is procla imed. According to the 339"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"commanding words of An and Enlil . . . their dominion shall come to an end. . . .\" So it was quite clearly a matter of wiping out the im­ pure. Another tablet reads: In those days, in the chamber of creation of the gods, in their house Duku were Lahar and Ashman formed . . . In those days Enki said to Enlil: \"Father Enlil, L a har and Ashman, they who were created in the Duku, let us allow them to descend from the Duku.\" Was the \"chamber of creation of the gods\" the same as the \"Duku\"? And was the \"Duku\" from which the two were to descend the spaceship of the gods? This assump­ tion is automatically suggested by the vivid description. In 188 9 , scholars of Pennsylvania University brought home from an expedition the oldest true-to-scale town plan in the world, the plan of the town of Enlil-ki, or Nippur. In this town of the god of the air Enlil, there was a gate for the sexually impure. I think this gate was a pro­ tective measure by the gods after their work was done. After they had produced a new generati on, they wanted to prevent a lapse into bestial ity by separating the new men from their still contaminated environment. One cuneif orm tablet even gives a brief reference to the gods' method of fertilization, namely to the implant ation of the divine seed. The Pentateuch, which has already suppli ed me with such a wealth of illustrative material about the means of locomotion of the galactic supermen of primiti ve times, is a mine of information for my theory, so long as the texts are read imaginatively, with the eyes of a man living in the age of space travel.

And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount. And mount Sinll:i was altogether on a smok.e, because the Lord descended upon it in fire: and the smok.e thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked gr eatly. And ... the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder . Exodus 20: 18 says: .. And all the people saw the thunderings, and the light­ nings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.\" Does anyone still believe today that the Lord God Al­ mighty had to travel in a vehicle that smoked and light­ ninged and caused earthquakes, and made a fiendish noise like a jet fighter? God was omnip resent. But if He was, how could He watch over and guard His children and yet appear in such a terrifying way? Why did He frighten His children so much that they ran away from Him? The great, compassionate God! Nevertheless He ordered Moses to keep the people away from the mountain where the landing took place.

I should also like to examine what the Old Testament has to say about artificial insem ination. God (or the \"go ds\") had landed on earth in a cosmic vehicle. They began their most important task of fertilizing the inhabi­ tants of earth with their seed. They separated all the peo­ ple chosen for this experiment from the hybrid bestial world and destined them for the \"journey into the wil­ derne ss.\" There they had their guinea pigs in quarantine, so to speak. They protected them from their enemies and gave them manna and ambrosia so that they did not starve. They had to stay like that \"in the wilderness\" for a whole gener ation. Exodus 19 :4 says : \"Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings [I], and brought you unto mys elf. \" If it is true that the \"gods\" were masters of the genetic code, it throws light on the darkness surrounding many texts, for example, the passage in Genesis 1: 26-27: \"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness . . . So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him . . . \" Not· until later, as I have already mentioned, was woman created from man, as Moses tells us in Genesis 2:2 2: \"And the rib, which Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman .... \" Noah, survivor of the flood and progenitor of the races of the world, was placed in the womb of Bat-Enosh by the \"go ds.\" Abr aham's wif e Sarah, who could no lo nger bear children because of her advanced age, was visit ed by God and brought her son Isaac into the world. Moses recounts this in Genesis 2 1 : 1 : \"And the Lord visited Sarah as he had said, and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken. 34 3"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"\"For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age .... \" The Lord confides in the Prophet Jeremiah (I: 5 ) : \"Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee ... \" The reference to knowing Jeremiah before birth is crystal clear if we take it in the sense of programming ac­ cording to the genetic code. Many Old Testament stories seem to me to refer to fertilization by the gods. In my in­ terpretation the \"gods\" created a special race to carry out the terrestrial tasks they later entrusted it with. Moses speaks about the future of the race in Genesis 15: 5 : (God is speaking to Abraham) \"Look now towards heaven and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them ... So shall thy seed be.\" But the seed must preserve its individuality, according to Leviticus 20: 24: \"I am the Lord your God, which have separated you from other people.\" However, the \"gods\" had no end of trouble with their creatures, who could not give up their old habit of cou­ p ling with animals. So Moses warns backsl iders and threatens them with punishment in Leviticus 18: 23 et seq .: Nei ther shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therew ith: nei ther shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto: it is confusion. Defile ye not yourselves in any of these things : for in all these the natio ns are defiled which I cast out before you: And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhab· itants.

And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt surely kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death. . . . The chosen people were finally to be freed from this sexual deviation, but only after spending forty years in quarantine in the wilderness. Afterward, the new genera­ tion would be disgusted at the idea of crossbreeding with animals. So the \"gods\" carried on a hard, but successful battle against the half men, half animals, and on behalf of the higher men genetically progra mmed by them. Con­ sequently, they only allowed the young generation to re­ turn to the promised land. Listen to Num bers 14: 2 9 -:- 3 0 on the subject : \"Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness ; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward ... \"Doubtless ye shall not come into the land .... \" But the same strict laws also applied to life in the promised land, according to Joshua 2 3 :7 and 12-1 3 : That ye come not among these nations, these that re­ main among you . . . If ye . . . shall make marria ges with them, and go into them, and they to you: Know for a certainty that the Lord your God will no more drive out any of these natio ns ... but they shall be snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your side, and thorns in your eyes. . . . 3 4 5"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"After the entry into the promised land, customs and mores were still very strict.

If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof he not turned white; then the priest shall shut him up that hath the plague seven days. \"God s,\" i.e., unknown intell igences, taught the new men to diagnose diseases and-as in this case-to isolate the sick. Modern instructions for total and scrupulous disinf ec­ tion were also given.

The Old Testament texts are steps in the construction of a religi on; they do not reflect an accurate historical unfolding of time. Comparisons with the literature of other ancient, and older, peoples lead to the conclusion that the events chronicled in the Pentateuch could not have taken place in the period as­ signed to them by theologists. The Old Testament is a wonderful collection of laws and practical instructions for civilization, of myths and bits of genui ne hist ory.

The central p roblem is: How can an omniscient god make mistakes? Can we really call a god almighty who, after creating man, says that his work is good, but a little later is full of repentance for what he has done? Compare Genesis I: 3 1: \"And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good\" with Genesis 6:6: \"And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.\" The same God who had created man decided to destroy His work. And He did it often. Why? The idea of original sin also seems inconsistent to me. Surely God, who created man, must have known that His creations would be sinful? And if He did not know, how can He be an omni scient god? God punished not only Adam and Eve for the Fall, but all their innocent descendants as well. Yet their children's children had no part in the Fall; indeed, they knew noth­ ing about it. Did God in His rage want to be propitia ted by the sacrifice of the blood of the innocent? I doubt 'whether an infinitely good god has feelings of revenge. Nor do I understand why almig hty God later allowed His own innocent Son to be put to death in a gruesome way in order to forgive the whole world for its sins. When I ask such questions, I am not trying to deni­ grate or doubt the great religions. I only point out these contradictions because I am convin ced that the great God of the universe has absolutely nothing in common with the \"gods\" who haunt legends, myths, and religions, and who effected the mutation from animal to man.

Today it is permissible to discuss problems and debatable points, and so I ask more questions. Why did God and His angels always show themselves in connectio n with phenomena such as fire, smoke, earth­ quakes, lightning, noise, and wind? Bold and imaginative explanations are offered of the kind that can flower into axiomatic proofs in the course of two thousand years of dialectical training. But who has the courage to take the mysterious as reality? The Swiss professor Dr. Othmar Keel thought that these epiphanies of God ought to be und erstood as ideo­ grams, in direct opposition to Professor Lindborg who interprets the same events as hallucinat ory experiences. The Old Testament scholar Dr. A. Guillaume considers them to be natural events, while Dr. W. Beyerlein recog­ nizes ritual parts of the Israelite religious holiday customs in nearly all the phenomena. Scholarly explanations? I find nothing but contradic­ tions. But the change in mental climate among the younger generation is refreshing. Thus Dr. Fritz Dum ermuth wrote in the periodical of the theological faculty of BasIe (November 2 J, J 9 6 5 ) that: on closer inspection the accounts in question can hardly be equated with natural phenomena of a meteorological or volcanic kind.

Exo­ dus 25: 2 mentions an offering, a concept it is easy to miss the point of.

Was the offering the price demanded by the \"gods \" for the great amount of intelligent knowl edge transmitted?

The story of Hercules tells of the Nemean lion, who had fallen down from the moon and could not be wounded \"by any human weapon .\" Another saga de­ scribes the dragon Ladon, whose eyes never slept and whose weapons were \"fire and frightful hissing. \" Before Medea and Jason could carry off the Golden Fleece, they had to outwit the dragon who was covered with flashing 35 2"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"scales of iron and who writhed about, enveloped in flames.

Moses tells us of an angel who was helpful on God's orders in Exodus 2�:2(}-21: Behold, I send an angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have pre­ pared. Beware o( him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgr essions: (or my name is in him. To me it seems only logical that a robot has the name or mind of his constructor \"in him,\" and also that he can never deviate from his progr amming. One thing I always found wonderful as a schoolboy was Jacob's experience as told in Genesis 28: 12. When Jacob laid down to sleep at night on one of his journeys , he saw a ladder the top of which reached to heaven and had God's angels climbing up and down it. Had Jacob per­ haps surprised the servants of God loading goods into a spaceship? Was Jacob 's wonderful experience an eye-wit­ ness account? As a crucial test of my audacious claims, my readers should make the experiment of reading \"robot s,\" as we understand the term today, for \"dragons\" whenever they are ment ioned in ancient texts. It is astonishing how in­ telligible the unint elligi b le suddenly becomes. I accept the fact that the theories I have expounded will be savage ly attacked.

And these overseers are supposed to have been robots or automatons? I try to recognize a reality that once existed behind myths, legends, and traditions. Here are some incontro­ vertible facts. Tibetans and Hindus called the universe the mother of the terrestrial race. The natives of Malekula (New Hebrides) state that the first race of men consisted of descendants of the sons of heaven. The Red Indians say that they are the descendants of the thunderbird. The Incas believed they descended from the \"sons of the Sun.\" The Rapanui trace their origin back to the birdmen. The Mayas are supposed to be children of the Pleiades. The Teutons claim that their forefathers came with the flying Wa nen. The Indians believe that they descend from Indra, Ghurka or Bhima-all three of whom drove through the heavens in fire ships. Enoch and Elijah disap peared forever in a chariot of fire. The South Sea islanders say they descend from the god of heaven, Tangalao, who came down from heaven in an enormous gleaming egg. One core is common to these genealogical stories: \"Gods\" came, chose a group whom they fertilized and separated from the unclean.

We have seen that time for the crew of a spaceship traveling just below the speed of light passes considerably slower than for those who stay behind on the launching planet. Should we regard it as coincidence that the oldest writings, quite independently of each other, constantly emphasize that the units of time applicable to the gods are different from ours? A human generation was only a moment to the Indian god Vishn u. Each of the legendary empe rors of Chinese prehistory was a heavenly ruler, who drove through the sky with fire-br eathing dragons and lived for 18,000 ter­ restrial years. Indeed, P'an Ku, the first heavenly ruler, traveled around in the cosmos 2,22 9 ,000 years ago, and even our own familiar Old Testament assures us that in the hand of God everyth ing is \"a time and times and the dividing of time\" (Daniel 7: 2 5 ) , or as Psalm 9 0: 4 so magnificently expresses it: \"For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.\" 3 55"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"12 Qyestions and Still More Qyestions WE R E outward signs of age-old traditions misund erstood during past millennia?

May not these \"gods ,\" whom mankind has longed for and prayed to in all ages, have left behind technical in­ structions which would enable us to meet them in the universe? Since the beginning of human history, wars have been and are being continuously waged somewhere or other on our planet. Did the \"gods\" promise peace on earth be­ cause they knew that once the inhabitants of earth had felt the full impact of seeing their tiny planet from outer space, they would realize that all terrestrial squabbles were utterly futile? Do the \"gods\" hope or expect that once earthly beings get to know space, they will lose the national conscious­ ness they have only assumed and instead consider the in­ finite cosmos as the universal motherland? From the perspective of the universe all men will be simply inhabitants of the third planet, a minor sun on the edge of the galaxy-and not Russians or Chinese, Americans or Europeans, black or white. Could mankind make its age-old dream of going to heaven come true if it took up the promise of the \"gods\"?

Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh A brainy man, whose field is our reading habits -I think it was Professor Alphons Silbennann ---discovered that a 'reading genera tion' lasts four years. Work it out for yourself and I think you'll find he's right. From the age of two to six, brightly colour ed picture books fonn the first generation of reade rs. Then come fairy tales and tiresome school books, until the age of ten (nowadays!) when childr en start to read comics and in the case of smart girls and boys adventur e and travel books and stories about animals. Early developers, at the age of about 14, use interesting factual books and the whole spectrum of novels as reading material. At 18 begins the first predilection for specialis ed subjects, which may last a lifetime or alter the rhythm of the reading gener ations, depending on a person's profession, private life, hobbies or on special events. If I reflect on this rhythm, three and a half gener ations of readers have grown up since the publication of my first book in 1967. Anyone who was 16 years old in 1967 is 30 today. Perhaps we have already met, dear reader, perhaps you are one of the great mass of my public who can be relied on to be there when a new book by me comes out nearly every two years. But of course many of my new readers come up against it when I confinn my 'old' theories in a new book with brand new items of knowledge. That is the fa te of all hypotheses, even the most scientific of them. They must be developed. And I admit that this puts me in a dilemma every time. My starting points are clear to my faithful readers, but what sort of basic data should I give my new readers, so that they have finn ground under their feet amid all the talk of heaven and earth? I don't want to bore my oid readers, but neither do I want to send my new adherents into the forest without a compass. 3 67"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"So I shall simply state in 'telegrammese' what I have been claiming for 14 years. The world was visited by alien beings from space in pre­ historic times. They are known as extraterrestrials in the literature on the subject. The extraterrestrials created human intellig ence by altering the hereditary material of the still primitiv e inhabitants. Scientists would describe it as mutation, an artificially produced change in the hereditary process. In my view the origin of human intelli gence is not a chance result, not a winning ticket in a lottery with milliards of possibilities, but a planned intervention by alien beings from space. The aliens' visits to earth also produced the oldest religions and the creation of myths and legends at the heart of which the facts about real events that took place in the past are handed down. If these briefly sketched hypotheses had not been highly explosive, they could not have set ofT a global controversy . In fact I was sawing unashamedly at the foundation pillars of the traditional mental edifice. Equipped wi t h knowle dge that I had acquired over 14 years I was constantly crossing the frontiers between the territories earmarked by arch­ aeologists, ethnologists, space-travel speci alists and, in­ evitably, theologians. I freely admit that I had to tread on a lot of toes during my wanderings. And also that I was led into error in some special cases. No doubt about that. But, and I found that out on my travels, there is a lot in my hypotheses. Books attacking me were plJbli shed in every language in the world . A whole phalanx of authors ganged up to assail my global success, sometimes hitting below the belt. Drowning people hit out in all directions. I am tolerant about this. On the other hand an increasing number of books are appearing that take my theories seriously and even welcome them. Some of them are by well-known scientists. The subject had global reverberations almost unparal leled in our century. It was not only my films Memories of the Future and Message of the Gods which contributed to this, the American super-films Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back were also fertilised by my ideas. My faithful readers met situations on the screen that were familiar to them. 3 68"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"The pop group Exiled (RCA PL 25297) has hit the bull's­ eye with their latest hit.

Ifit had not been for this letter from Cape Town, South Africa, I should never have dreamed of going to the Kiribat is:· Dear Mr von Daniken, I know that you are a man with a lot of commitments and therefore I will not waste your time but come to the point. I have been intending to write to you about some definite evidence of 'gods that came from the sk y'. During my time as a missionary in the Pacific, I was shown the graves of two giants who, the locals told in their folk-tales, came from the skies. These are well-preserved graves and each is approximately 5 m long. There are also many footsteps fossilised in the rocks and these are so numerous as to make photography quite simple. There is also a 'stone compass' and a site where the folk-tales say that the 'gods' landed. This place is most interesting because it is completely devoid of plant life and is in a perfect circle. If you are interested I would be pleased to follow it up and give you more information; if, on the other hand, you know all the evidence already, I shall not be offended not to hear from you. With every good wish and again many thanks for hours of good reading. Yours sincere]y, Reverend C. Scarborough I received this letter at the end of May 1978. A Protestant parson who was receptive to my ideas? I thanked him by return, asking for the information he offered and also whether there were any photographs of the mysterious places or literature about them. Naturally I 3 7 1"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"offered to pay any expenses he might incur. A month passed before Reverend Scarborough answered: Dear Mr von Daniken, Thank you for the reply to my letter. Firstly let me ex­ plain that I have no need of remunerati on. I am only too happy to help you in your quest for infor mation. You inquire as to available literature. Unfortunately it is almost non-existent, and on the subject about which we will be corresponding there is no literature whatsoever. More's the pity. I appreciate that you must hear news from 'cranks' all over the world, so it might be a good idea to establish my credentials from the start. I am a Congregational minister in Sea Point, South Africa. Before coming to take up this position my wife and I and two children were missionaries in the Kiribati Islands (formerly Gilbert Islands) South Pacific under the authority of the London Missionary Society. We spent a period of three and a half years there and could speak the native language fluently. We travelled extensively through­ out the 16 islands and spent many months on each island. We became aware of the strange and inexplicable ancient history of the islands very soon after learning the lan­ guage. The first thing that struck me was the fact that the islanders had two names for people. They themselves they referred to as aomata, meaning simply man in the plural. Anyone with a white skin and tall was referred to as te i-matang, which is translat ed literally as 'man from the land of gods'. As we got to know the islanders better we found that this difference between them and foreigners existed on all the islands. As you may wish to investigate the matter yourself at some point, I must tell you that the islanders can be very uncommunicative to strangers unless you adopt the right approach. They are very religious. They are ruled by the Protestant and Catholic native ministers to a great degree and unless you make your peace with the ministers you might as well stay at home. Be seen to mix with the islanders themselves and not so 3 72"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"much with the government and European community and you will make headway. I am sure that you are a past master of all this kind of diplomacy. The letter contained instructions about where to find the giants' graves and a descr iption of the compass stones in the south of 'an' island, which, the missionary discovered, had lines scratched on them giving the bearings of far distant goals. It was also interesting to hear that the stones must have been transported from elsewhere, because that kind of stone does not exist on the island. My correspondent had this to say about the 'landing site of the gods': On this point I must give you two possibilities as I confess to have forgotten on which island it was. It was either Tarawa North or Abaiang, both of which are close enough to see one island from the other. Ifmy memory serves me correctly, it was Abaiang. There the local tabunia (witch-doctor) keeps watch over this strange site. It is known to the islanders and they will readily tell you where the open site is to be found. It is a part of the island with dense undergrowth. The islanders go there secretly when the ministers are not watching to make their offerings to the gods. . In this case you will most certainly need the help of the local tabunia . He will lead you as he did me through the bush until you come to the circle. There nothing grows, not a weed or a tree, and there is no living thing to be seen. He will tell you that anyone who walk s over the large open circle will soon die. Why? Radiation or what? It is interesting when you are there to note that trees that have begun to grow leaning towards the circle have turned in their growth and leaned away from this open area. Nothing grows in the centre of the circle. When the Resident Commissioner visited the spot in 1965, he said to me that it must be radioactive. But radioactivity on a coral island? Again it is referred to in folk-lore as the landing place of the gods. Thi� minister, miles away and unknown to me, had got me going. I was champing at the, bit: where were the Kiribatis? 3 7 3"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"There are four big atlases on the shelves of my library, but none of them mentions the Kiribatis. Three famous reference works, the Encyclopaedia Britannica, Brockhaus and Larousse tell me that there are 1,200 kinds of flea, but they've never head of the Kiribatis. WeU-informed books of the seven ties still do not mention them, these Kiribati Isles float­ ing in the Pacific. They do exist, for I was there, and they are interesting fleas in that infinite sea. As my pious informant had lived on the Kiribatis, they must exist. I asked everyone I could think of: 'Have you heard of the KiribatisT The answer was always the same blank look, followed by 'KiribatisT . Finally I wrote to Cape Town and asked my clerical friend: Where are the Kiribatis? How does one get there? Are there any flights? Where can I stay? Are there any hotels? What is the cur,rency used on the islands? What sort of presents should we take with us fo r the priests, magicians and other local inhabi tants? Should we look out for any special dangers such as snakes, poisonous scorpions or spiders? Are you still in touch with friends or acquaintances there? Could you give me the names of people I could get in touch with and to whom I could mention your name as a ref erence? Reverend Scarborough answer ed promptly and helpf ully. The mist around the Kiribatis was cleared away. They consisted of a group of sixteen islands forming part of the British Crown Colony of the Gilbert Islands until they obtained their independence in 1977 and the name was changed. They float in the Pacific Ocea n, have an area of 973 sq km and a population of some 52,000 Micronesians . . One can fly to the main island of Tarawa, with a port and the seat of government, from Nauru, the island republic, or Suva, the capital of the biggest Fijian island. As gifts the Reverend recommended modern multi -purpose pocket-knives for the community leaders, cheap sunglasses for the fishermen and aspirin for the priests and women . Reverend Scarborough wrote comfortingly that there were 3 7 4"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"no snakes or spiders, and although there were scorpions their bite was no worse than a wasp sting. The letter warned: The real danger lies in the sea. Never bathe in the sea, even if the islanders tell you otherwise. Sharks are a real danger to every swimmer, as are other forms of submarine life. I can't warn you too strongly: never bathe in the sea! When I look back, I know fo r certain that we should have gone swimming if it had not been for this emphatic warning. My unknown well-wisher invited me to get in touch with his old friends, the ministers Kamoriki and Eritaia, and said they were nice men who would certa inly help me. Likewise Captain Ward of the ship Moana Roi, with his deep know­ ledge of the islands, could be helpful, since Ward was fa miliar with local legend and the islanders' holy places. Contr ary to the popular belief that I am a rich man who can make such journ eys simply by putting my hand in my pocket, I always plan to visit several places in a particular region so that expenditure on travel does not exceed the potential income. Only too often, advanc e infor mation turns out to be false on arrival, the fantasies of cranks, as the Reverend wrote, and then time and money are wasted. However, in 1980 a useful combination came up. The Seventh World Congress of the Ancient Astronaut Society was to take place in the summer in New Zeala nd. The AAS is an international non- profit-making organisation which discusses the subjects of my books. New Zealand! That was half the cost of reach ing my goal, the Kiribati Islands. I dictated a letter to Reverend Kamoriki on Tarawa. Early in 1980 I had an answer written in a shaky hand which indi­ cated that the parson was quite an old man. I read that Captain Ward had been pensioned ofT some years ago and returned to England, but Kamoriki and his fa mily would be glad to receive me and my friends, and naturally we must be his house guests. That sounded good. Feeling very gratef ul I deciphered the postscript in tiny spidery writing: 'Have 'You got an entry permit?' My secretary Willi Diinnenber ger and I set the telephone wires humming. Who would give us a visa?

The Kiribatis are a blank spot in the diplomatic lands cape of Switzerland. An official in the Ministr y for Foreign Affairs gave us a tip: 'Phone the Australians or the English .' The Australian Embassy told me that they did in fact trade with the group of islands and gave them development grants, but were not responsible for visas. In London the Office for Pacific Affairs was able to tell us that Swiss nationals could obtain an entry permit on their arrival at Tarawa, provided they undertook not to stay longer than three months and could produce a return air ticket. Three months! It wasn 't as if we were going to build huts on the Kiribatis! We got our kit ready: four cameras with cases for object lenses, films, a small Geiger counter, a first-aid case, pocket­ knives, sunglasses and aspirins. As always we tried to cut down as much as possible, but there was still a mountain big enough to make two men weak at the knees. We were in despair when we were saved by a tall young friend, Rico Mercurio, one of those rare people for whom nothing is too much trouble and who does not watch the clock when something important needs doing. Rico cuts diamonds and even more valuable jewels for a well-known Zurich finn. They are used to adorn the watches which the oil sheikhs give to the wo m en in their harems. Rico said that after two years without a holiday a break in the Kiribatis, wherever they were, would do him good . We told him it would.

There are 25 long hours of flying time between Zurich and Auckland. These long-dist ance flights are horrible. At first you read a pile of newspapers you haven't had time to catch up with. More out of boredom than hunger you gulp down the rich meals. You clamp the headphones over your ears, you try to sleep, but your time rhythm is out of step and you can't. We watch the film of Agatha Christie's Death on the Nile, but even that does not kill time.

But New Zealand has something we cannot otTer-the sea. If anyone wants Switzerland plus sea, they should emigrate to New Zealand. Owing to the constant breezes from the Pacific, the air here is purer and tangier than in Switzerland in spite of the 40 million sheep. Forty million sheep and only 4 million New Zealanders.

Our onwar d flight from Auckland to the island of Nauru with Air Nauru was planned for 13 July. The fact that the flight was delayed for 24 hours had nothing to do with the number 13. The oddest airline in the world does not stick to timetables. We waited. We were tired and often rather hungry, a state explained by the consumption in the airport restaurant of a gruesome speciality of the countr y-spaghetti sandwiches. White worms in sticky sweet tomato sauce coiled inside two slices of cottonwool toast. They don't taste any better if they're heated.

Air Nauru operates with two twin-jet Boeing 727 passenger aircraft and two triple- jet 737s. The President of the Republic of Nauru is reputed to have said that Air Nauru was needed to fly in phosph ate contracts, cheques, engineers and repairmen, but if a 'normal' passenger wanted to go along, he would be allowed to. That is certainly a rare occurrence, for the rich island has no tour­ ism. With its 21 sq km Nauru is an islet that lies just below the Equator on longitude 1670 east of Greenwich. Nauru is sur­ rounded by a reef that descends steeply into the open sea and consists of coral containing phosphate deposits. The wealth of this tropical island is based on phosphate.

Dusty conveyor belts rattle down to the harbour with the indis pensable fertiliser which cranes load on to freighters bound fo r Australia and New Zeala nd. Accord ing to the Annual Report of the Nauru Phosphat e Corporation for 1979, reserves will last for another 14 years, although in that year alone phosphate to the value of 79,444,463 Australian dollars was sold. Given the present volume of exports, the phosphate deposits could be exhauste d in five years. Then the island's wealth would come to an end. The export of coconuts and vegetables brings in very little. A few years ago the government had the .only acceptable hotel, the Meneng, built for Air Nauru pilots, engineers and businessmen in the Phosphate Corporation so that travellers used to better accomm odation would at least have somewhere cool to stay. So the first thing that hits your sweaty face at the entrance is a blast from the air-conditioning. The waitresses in the dining-room look serious and digni­ fied. They bring you a menu, the front page of which offers rather simple fare: baked fish with sweet potatoes and corn on the cob with melted butter. But on the back there is something sensational: three Australian and two New Zealand wines, the Chateau Mouton Rothschild, 1970 vin­ tage, for 35 Australian dollars, about £22. We thought it was a joke or a misprint. This 1970 vintage from Bordeaux was the wine of the century. In Switzerland you cannot lay your hands on it for less than 400 francs: in first-class restaurants you would have to pay at least double that. Chateau Mouton Rothschild is a drink for sheikhs who ask Muh ammad to avert his eyes for a moment when they trans­ gress his ban on alcohol. It is no drink for ordinary mortals. Rico said, 'Friends, this is our last evening before the Kiribatis. We don't know what awaits us there. I'll stand you a bottle .' The waitress was flabbergasted when she saw Rico's finger pointing to the great wine. She could not m ove. As Rico's finger was almost boring a hole in the menu and he gave the terrified girl a look that was almost as penetrating, she trotted off behind the buff et and whispered to her pretty colleagues who began to giggle and stare at us. 3 7 9"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"The wine waiter sneered as he took the cork out.

The Rothschilds always decorate their 'Mouton' With a drawing by a famous painter. Whenever we raised our glasses the watching girls whis­ pered and giggled. I stood the second bottle. This wine was the purest n ec tar, a drink fit for gods. Behind the merry wives of Nauru an Asiatic cook bobbed up, his hearty laughter making his white chef's hat wobble. The maidens squealed as if we were unwittingly drinking castor oil that would give us a busy time that night. We checked our clothing to see if there was something wrong or ridiculous about it. We were wearing correct tropical gear. The Air Nauru pilot who had flown us over came into the room. As he spoke the local language, we asked him to find out why we had been laughed at for two hours. He nodded and strode-every inch an aviator --to the circle of clucking hens and soon returned to our table with the result of his mission. 'They're laughing, gentlemenj because they have found three crazy foreigners st u pid enough to drink such an old wine and pay 35 dollars for it into the bargai n. Bye-bye .' We were not ashamed of our stupidity. Willi ordered the third bottle and I wrote the numbers of the labels in my notebook, knowing that this would be my first and last en­ counter with that unforgettable 1970 Chateau Mouton Rothschild: 242/443, 242/444 and 242/445. We had to tear Rico away. Although we could not speak the language, he had made unmistakable visual contact with a beautif ul waitress, an Esperanto understood by men and women everywhere. The Air Nauru Boeing 727 was supposed to fly to Tarawa. the main island of the Kiribati group, at 6.30 a.m. on 15 July, but it took otT an hour late. We were going to learn on more than one occasion that time over there has a different value from that of our own hectic world. At seven o'clock we were in the little airport at Tarawa surrounded by coffee-brown and black men and women who 3 80"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"were starting the day in a cheerf ul and leisurely way. They took no notice of us. No one grabbed our cases from us, as they do in South American and Arabic countries, no one dragged us towards a taxi shouting volubly. In the equatorial morning sunlight our presence seemed pretty superfluous. In search of the right address for my mission, I turned to a young man who was idly contemplating the motley throng. Like the rest of the islanders, all he wore was the tepe, a brightly colou red rectangular piece of cloth, round his loins. When I spoke to him he smiled and said in a guttural voice, 'Ko na mauri !, I did not realise then, nor even guess, that during that very morning, ko na mauri, thou shalt be blest, would become part of our vocabulary. The islander asked, 'You speak English?' The language, a relic of the English colonial days, helped me out of my difficulty, but in answer to my question about taxis he replied sympathetically, 'No taxi here.' I asked if there was a hotel. Reverend Kamoriki had not answered that questi on. With an emba rrassed grin, the boy said there was no hotel, only a government guest-house. 'Wait here,' he said and set otT at a trot baref oot, the ingrowing toenails on his big toes obviously causing him no pain. The Air Nauru aircraft had flown on. The crowd who had come to meet relatives had dispersed. A few locals who ap­ parently intended to spend the day here turned their curious gaze on us and offered to help. We waited for our boy, who finally trundled up in a small clapped-out lorry. He drove us to the Otintai guest-house . A remarkably nervous man, his high forehead pouring with sweat which he wiped clear of his eyes with a large blue rag, was daydreaming behind the recep tion desk. In easily intel­ ligible English he explained that the government would not decide whether the hotel would strike until that afternoon and that in the meantime he could not accept any guests owing to the shortage of statT. I cautiously asked what the strike was about. 'People want to work longer,' he said wearily and wiped a stream of sweat from his eyebrows. 'P eople want to work longer?' I asked, my ears still ringing with demands for 30- and 35-hour weeks, for 7 and 8 weeks' 3 81"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"On the isla nders' doorstep natur e provides everyt hing they need for living. free of charge.

The nervous gentleman explained that wage earners in the Kiribatis were pensioned off at the age of 50 with a reduced income. Those now on strike wanted the pensionable age to be set at a minimum of 55, for on none of the islands did the d e pressed economic situation offer the possibility of sup­ plementary work. There was no industry, while copra, island hand icrafts and phos phate from the island of Banaba were the narrow basis of the export trade. The only thing there was plenty of was manpower. After the first impressions on my arrival, I wondered automatically why the islanders wanted to work longer. Everything necessary for a peacef ul life was supplied virtually free by nature: fish from the sea, palm trees fo r building huts in the permanently hot climate and nourishing fruit. Since these idyllic islands had been blessed with officials and administrations, since they had had to export and adopt the profit motive, the bacillus of that 382"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"occidental sickness, the strike, had crept in. No, civilisation does not create happiness. It was at least obliging of the sweaty black gentleman to let us dump our luggage in a comer behind his desk. It would have been embarrassing to descend on the pastor with bag and baggage. The island of Tarawa is a typical atoll, a horseshoe-shaped coral island which from great depths protrudes only a few metres above sea level. Between the north and south parts of Tarawa lies a lagoon connected with the sea by natural chan­ nels. As the terrain is so frequently penetrated by water, the north of the island can only be reached by boat and is almost uninhabited, whereas the south is fairly thickly populat ed. That was where our little van jolted over the narrow strips of coral terrain. From our seat high up in the back of the lorry we could see only a few stone building s-government offices, churches, the hospital and a fe w private houses belonging to the better­ off islanders. Palm trees provided the material for the indig e­ nous method of building: bungalow-type huts of palm trunks and fronds. Often they have only one room. The wealthier permit themselves two or three rooms. The 'communications centre' is always the living-room where people gossip, eat, sing and sleep and even beget children. In spite of the early hour and the pleasant breeze created by our speed, the humid equatorial heat made us pour with swea t. Our shirts and trousers clung to our bodies. Plumes of smoke from open fires spiced the close salty air. Our vehicle wound its way along a narrow road between palms, bread­ fruit trees and huts. The islanders waved to us; childr en ran alongside our wheezing lorry. The island of Tarawa seemed to be a haven of peace, but there was a strike on. On our right we could see the calm waters of the lagoon, on our left lay small villages, while right behind them the huge Pacific rollers thunde red against the reef as they had done since time immemo rial. There were no seasons here. Every day the sun rose and set at the same time. Our boy stopped the lorry outside the small unpla stered houses. Pink curtains waved in the open windows, something we never saw anywhere else. 'That is Reverend Kamor iki's house,' said our driver. 3 8 3"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"�' .• .. . ' \" r,"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"One old lady and two younger women were watching us from a window. They disappeared like ghosts when we looked at them. The house had no doors, only open entrances, and as the pink curtains were drawn we could see into the interior: on the right, in the largest of the three rooms, stood a large mosquit o-net-dr aped bed that had seen better times; the other two rooms appeared to be unfurnished. Our driver had gone into the house and was talking to one of the young women. A sad expression came over his normally cheerful face. He came up to us slowly and he obviously did not relish telling us what he had just heard. 'Reverend Kamoriki is dead !' That was a shock. The Reverend was dead. I remembered the shaky handwri ting, which was that of a very old man. The Reverend Scarborough also mentioned in his letter the name of his colleague, Eritaia. I asked about him. Yes, said our guide, Reverend Eritaia lived in the other house, but was a very, very old man, who certa inly could not receive any visitors. Then he asked if the childr en of the two clergymen could not help us and led us into the courtyard of the adjoin­ ing house. A coffee-brown man of about 35 with the thick black hair characteristic of the islanders crouched on the ground on a coconut mat. When he realised that we were there, he stood up and said with the ghost of a smile, 'Ko na mauri.' 'Good morning, sir,' I replied . Bwere, Eritaia's son, understood and spoke English very well, so that I was able to tell him about my correspondence with the Reverend Scarborough, the letter from Reverend Kamoriki and my mission, in particular that I was interested in the mythology of the island and had made the long journey to examine the places with their hidden secrets. Bwere gave his visitors a long delib erate scrutiny: Willi and Rico who stood behind me sweating, and me, politely explai ning my mission. After his inspecti on he asked, 'How long do you mean to stay on the island?' We drove past vil lages behind which the giant Pacific rollers have been thunder­ ing on to the beach since time immemorial. Beautiful girls sit outside their huts under the palms and prepare dried fish for the next meal. 3 8 5"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"Without thinking I answered, 'About a week,' and thought to myself that we could prolong our stay if necessary. Bwere lowered himself to the coconut mat. With a superior smile he re-examined us closely and then burst out laugh­ ing. 'A week! You'r e crazy. You must come from a strange country to take such a cavalier attitude to time! You want to investig ate a serious subject and you'v e only got a week! You need months to visit our islands, which are scattered widely .' He looked at us crossly. 'Go and loaf in the sun for a couple of days and come back when you've got more time ... In any case, you can't do anything during the strike; there's no hotel room at the Otintai and no means of transport .' I was cross with myself , with our frantic life, the tyranny of deadlines, the professional, family and finaJ:lcial pressures in which we hang like spiders in a web. Bwere was right, but we were there and it had been no shor t joyride. Nothing was going to stop us seeing and exami ning the goal of our jour­ ney, seeing it in person and checking it, in spite of the strike and although we could not spend months there. Reverend Scarborough had warned me to be very diplomatic when dealing with the islanders. I made a quick mental review of everything I had said so fa r. Had Bwere Eritaia been upset by my abrupt answers? Perhaps the islands' secrets were under a taboo and they were · protected from the eyes of strangers. I tried diplomacy. 'The little we have so fa r seen on this marvellous island has made a deep impression on us. Your countr ymen are friendly and helpf ul. We're sorry we can't stay here long. And we don't want to give any trouble. It would mean a lot to us even if we knew whether there was a school with a library which would tell us about the local mythology. We should be most gratef ul.' Bwere, who had been so prickly, posit ively smirked. He himself was the government cultural official; the library and archives were under his care . .He would open them for us and would also help us in our search for local lore. The first and presumably the easiest stage on the way to our goal had been reached. I thought of some islets in the Micronesian Caroline Islands, north of the Equator. They had natural landing grounds on which a small propeller- 3 86"},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"driven aircraft could land. I asked if there were such landing strips on the Kiribati Islands. With visible pride Bwere told me that they existed on the larger islands and that Air Tungaru, a small airline, flew a regular service between the islands. But, he went on, at the moment the machines were grounded because of the strike. I could ask the head pilot if he felt brave enough to break the strike, but he did not hold o:ut much hope. A beautif ul woman came from the house and put three coconuts down in front of Bwere. He opened them with a skilful blow of his machete and gave us the half nuts full of refreshing juice. It is amazing how many things can be made from the empty shells-the white flesh is rich in vitamins. Drinking vessels, plant pots, lamps in which glim­ mering wicks float in oil and even brassieres for adolescent girls. Bwere gestured to us to sit down on the coconut mat. He gave us a lesson in local history. He and his fellow coun try­ men were Micronesians, but their languag e was related to Melanesi an. Bwere said that there were various theories about the origin of the Kiribatis. Some scholars claimed that their forefathers came from Indo nesia and had interbred with a dark-skinned original race below the Equator, others said that they origi­ nally came from the South American continent, while still others traced their origins directly to divine beings who . had visited the island in former times. I pricked up my ears. Magic formed part of the Kiribatis' life, said Bwere. Although he was the son of a parson and a pract ising Christian, his eyes assumed a cryptic, almost fanatical look, but he did not elabor ate on this vague statemen t. I did not pursue the matter so as not to destroy his confidence. Besides I had read all the relevant literature before my journey and there had been a lot about magic in the islands. At the beginning of this century Arthur Grimble lived in the colony as envoy of the British CroWD. He learnt the Kirib ati language, shared their customs and usages and was so accepted by them that he was admitted to the exclusive sun clan Karongoa, a kind of secret lodge, which was a great honour. I read Grimble's . book l and also his daughter Rosemar y's2 who published a scholarly edition of her 3 87"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"Teeta. the son of Reverend Kamoriki. was our guardian angel on the roads and in the stea ming jungle. father's posthumous papers. Of the islanders' magic rituals, which our friend Bwere did not mention, she wrote: There is one incantation for the protection of coconuts, another for help to steal one's neighbours coconuts and yet another to prevent theft; there is a formula to conjure poison into one's enemy's food and another to prevent it. Then there is wawi, fatal magic, and bonobon to make it i neff ecti ve. Today six churches are trying to make the islanders re­ noun ce their magical practic es. Catholics, Prote�tants, Adventists, Mormons, the Chur ch of God and Baha'i are competing for the right way to save the Kiribatis' souls, for their manpower and the little money they possess.3 They take over everyday life, root out customs and usages preserved for centuries, encour age unrestrained conception to increase the numbers of their flock, compete to build the biggest churches. 3 88"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"By dark hints, Bwere himself did not seem to find this de­ velopment altogether favourable for his countrymen. Suddenly a baref ooted giant in tattered white shorts appeared in our midst. A massive muscular chest was beating under his T-shirt with the inscription Teeta. He smiled at us like a child and shook hands with everyone at the first break . in the convers ation. 'Ko na mauri. I am Teeta, the son of Reverend Kamor iki.' The English of his sonorous rather guttural baritone was hard to understand . You had to get used to it first, but Bwere explained that his family invited us to supper and that the Kamorikis would be glad to put us up. We thanked him politely, but asked if we could first check with the goverJ.1ment hotel Otintai to see if we could get rooms. I mentioned our luggage and said that we did not want to overburden his hospitality. This circumspect refusal took ten times as many sentences as Teeta 's invitation. Bwere drove us to the Otintai in a Toyota delivery truck. When he spoke after a long silence, we heard that he wanted to help us. 'You must be free to move around; you need a car. I have a friend who will rent you his.' He did not wait for us to answer and stopped outside a hut, next to which a small Datsun was parked under a palm­ leaf carport-the Japanese also have a hold on Kiribati. For a couple of Australian dollars, we drove to the hotel in 'our own' car. The sweating manager showed us to rooms 102 and 103 fo r one night. The next day it would be decided whether we had to leave the hotel because of the strike. When he handed over the keys, we took our luggage up to the first floor and opened the doors to two rooms which looked com­ pletely uninhabitable. In true Swiss fashion we got down to some sprin g-clean ing. We emptied stinking wastepaper baskets, gathered up the contents of overturned ashtrays, used rolled-up newspapers to sweep the floor clear of nut­ shells, cigarette butts and ragged underwear and fastidiously removed filthy sheets and blackish-g rey towels from the shower and put them in the corridor -to be removed after the strike. Above us the air-conditioning hummed its mono­ tonous song and wafted cold air at us, making the rooms an 3 8 9"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"oasis in the humid heat in spite of everything. After a good wash we left the hotel and spent the evening with the Kamorikis. We were curious. Were we going to get just a little nearer our goal? Teeta and Bwere were in evening dress-the former wore a pillarbox-r ed cloth round his loins, the latter a sky-blue one. Before entering the living-room we took ofT our shoes and stockings, fo r everyone went baref oot, including an old lady who shook hands with us and curtsied. She spoke to us in a melodious voice. She nodded, we nodded, we smiled when she smiled and we tried to say a few words of English, but made a mess of it. Bwere whispered that she was Reverend Kamoriki's widow, Teeta's mother. Her polite son, who softened his harsh baritone in her presence, invited us to sit on three chairs placed against the left-hand wall, the most comfortable part of the room because it was next to a fan. Bwere and Teeta squatted next to us, tailor fashion . An incredibly funny pantomime began. We sat speechless as if we were hatching ostrich eggs. The merry widow's chubby face radiated cheerf ulness.'and affection. Could she be under the effects of some kind of drug? Her eyes twinkled, she nodded confidentially, a friendly gesture we returned. Sometimes, but I don't know if it was intentional, an eyelid closed briefly as if she was winking. In case this was a local custom, I winked gaily back. Marcel Marceau, that marvel­ lous French mime artist, should have seen us. What a number he would have to add to his programme! This comic performance was interrupted by three enchant­ ing girls. They danced in baref ooted to unroll a gaily coloured 'tablecloth' on top of the coconut mat. They, too, kept nod­ ding at us, then disappeared silently to return with dishes and bowls which they laid out on the floor, along with plates and beakers. Because we were hungry, we gaped rather rudely at the lavish meal which made our mouths water: green, yellow and red vegetables, raw and cooked coconut meat, honey­ colour ed sweet potatoes, steamed and baked fish, cubes of meat in spicy sauces, grilled breadfuit, rice. Only the official protocol stopped us from tucking in. Three sweet little girls aged six or seven came up to us 3 90"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"quite unaff ectedly and crowned our unworthy heads with brilliant wreaths of flowers that smelt of jasmine and orchids. Before we could thank them, the little fa iries had vanished. Then widow Kamoriki, wearing a red dress with white flowers on it, stood up near the opposite wall and made a speech which Bwere translated. I took it down on tape and brought it home with me. Widow Kamoriki said 'My late husba nd, who rests out there in the garde n, offered you our hospitali ty-as is the custom. He told me to make you welcome-as is the custom. The wreaths in your hair mean friendship and peace-as is the custom. My daughters are happy to be able to cook and wash clothes for you-as is the custo m. My sons are honored to be able to help you-as is the custo m. I am only a foolish weak old woman who is fulfulling her husband's wishes-as is the custom. Our house is your house, our family is at your service-as is the custom.' Mrs Kamoriki sat down and smi led at us. We were moved by the hospitality of the good-nat ured old lady. Although I was as hung ry as a hunter, I stood up to express our gratitude and assure her that we visitors from a small country on the other side of the globe would be happy, during our stay on the Kiribatis, to learn what we had been unable to learn so far, and I offered our condolences on the death of the hus­ band and fa ther. I said that we would do nothing that would displease the late Rever end. The old lady nodded amiably and gestured to us to start eating. We left our chairs and squatted on the floor like Bwere and Teeta, next to the buffet. Groaning dishes and bowls circulated; we used our hands to heap our plates with all the delicious food. At first, in the European way, I offered dishes to the women, who were huddled against the wall at a dis­ tance, but they solemnly refused. They did not laugh and smile again until they saw that we liked the meal. We were only too happy to stuff ourselves. It was an outstanding meal, not least in comparison with those hideous spaghetti sand­ wiches! When we could not eat another morsel, in spite of constant pressing, the women crouched by the remains of the food on the gaily coloured cloth and began to eat. If we had known of this custom we would have tamed our appetites and left more. 3 9 1"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"During the women's snack, we discussed our plans for the next few days with Bwere and Teeta over a cigarette. Bwere thought that the stone circle was at a holy place on the island of Abaiang, as Reverend Scarborough had also intimated in his letter. Bwere said that Teeta would try to procure a boat and enough petrol for us to visit the island, which was 50 km away. Teeta askj!d if I had black Papuan toba cco on me. I hadn't and asked why. I was told that the place was taboo and that I would have to offer the tobacco as a sacrifice to make the magic of the place well disposed to us . Teeta firmly refused to obtain the tobacco for me . We had to buy it ourselves if it was to have any effect on the magic. During our convers ation, more than a dozen young men and women wearing only the brightly colour ed tepes round their waists crowded into the room, whispering and stealing curious looks at the flower-crowned foreigners. I have never seen better- looking people. We forgot the legendary circles, compass stones and myths; we were under the spell of vital animated nature. The group formed a row which gave us time to admir e the graceful movements and sensuous charm of the young islanders, creatures from some paradis e thought long lost. I began to understand the biblical giants and sons of the gods who had sinned with the daughters of man. Were they aware of their beauty, their fascination? They sang. Begin ning softly, then swelling to become a polyphonic choir. Two boys strummed guitars and a third drummed the rhythm on a hollow treetr unk. There were many vowels in the melodious song. After the third song boy and girl singers sat on the floor. A young girl knelt down before us and shouted in English, 'Now it's your turn!' We had to sing! After a quick consultation, we found out that our trio would have to be reduced to a duet. Rico said even at school he had been asked to keep his mouth shut because of the horrible noises he made. Our hosts and the choir gazed at us expect antly. Willi and I bravely rendered 'Blue Suede Shoes', not as well as Elvis Presley sang it, but well enough to be asked for an encore. Willi and I sang 'My Love Is Like a Red Red Rose'. It was a smash hit. There was a standing ovation, with applause, laughter and jumping about -a horde of happy children in paradise. 3 9 2"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"The locals lille in palm huts which are open all round. At any time of day you can see women, chi ldren and their neighbours exchanging gossip. The young islanders continued the lively programme until they broke off abruptly after a song, squatted again and the young girl repeated her challenge. 'It's your turn!' Because this could go on for ever, but also because our repertoire was running dangerously low, I tried desperately to think of a crowning melody. I had an inspiration. I went over to the singers and asked Bwere to explain to them that we would all sing a well-known European folksong 'Frere Jacqu es', a lovely, but simple, melody. I hummed the tune, then sang it aloud with the words and it took only a quarter of an hour before the musical Kiribatis were singing 'Frere Jacques' at concert pitch. Owing to this communal singsong, our soiree with Mrs Kamoriki, the close of our first day on Tarawa, gave us the freed om of the island. People waved at us when we walked down the street. When we came to the big maneaba, the com- 3 9 3"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"munity house, the centre of every village, people shook hands with us and pulled us-a gesture of special friendship-into the room that was open on all sides beneath the roof of brown palm fronds. It is the meeting place at which the old men do the talking and the young men are only allowed to join in if they are asked to. Women have no place here. They did not seem any the worse for it when they greeted us cheerf ully. When we looked inside the open huts which were scattered around, we could see them in animated conversation with their daughters and neighbours. Often they sang and some­ times we even heard 'Frere Jacques' during our stay. Over breakf ast at his house the next morning Teeta said that the sea was too rough for a small boat and that he could not get enough petrol for a large boat because of the strike. We ate bread from the breadf ruit tree. Each year every tree bears up to a hundr ed fruit the size of a Rugby football. These trees grow plentif ully on the Kiribatis and the whole fruit as well as its green shell can be used. When ground, it makes a pleasantly spicy-tasting porridge. Cut in slices like pineapples and grilled on hot stones, it forms a coarse-grained cake which tastes infinitely better than our industrially made bread. ' It tasted good but I could not enjoy it. The idea that the crazy strike might cripple our ventur e ruined my appetite. I took a drink of cold coconut milk and said, 'Yest erday Bwere mention ed a small airline. Couldn't we fly to Abaiang ?' Teeta looked at me in surpris e and answered in his agree­ able baritone, 'Okay, let's try it.' Teeta, who was our guardian angel during our stay, went to the airport with us so that we could meet Gil Butler, the Australian head pilot of Air Tungaru. We met a bad­ tempered aviator, who was swearing like a trooper about the strike and asked sarcastically if we Swiss had a magic wand to cure the chaos caused by the misguided islanders. Fly to Abaiang? No, he could not fly today because of the strike, but tomor row a colleague was flying a government deputy to Abaiang and if there were empty seats we could go with him and be back by evening. Being a best seller turned out to be a blessing. Gil Butler had read my book Return to the Stars and invited us to dine at his house the following evening.

We sensed that Teeta was embarrassed by the strike and was doing his best to keep us in good spirits. He led us into a hut and point ed to a bundle of sticky black plugs of tobacco which smelt revoltingly of liquorice, damp cigarette butts and-I have to say it-sweaty feet. This tobacco was imported from Papua, New Guinea. I bought a bundle, con­ vinced that the stench would drive out even the most evil of spirits once we stood on the threshold of the holy places. After this shopping session Teeta drove us to the little vil­ lage of'Bairiki and left us in the library, which had an aston­ ishing assortment of books. It contained literature from all over the Pacific. Thank heavens there was no strike here. Polite attendants brought us all the books we wanted. I was particularly interested in one book,4 the joint work of twenty­ five local aut\\lors, which contained the saga of the origin of the world and the Kiribatis. Under the humming fan which slowly stirred the heavy air in the room, I read a remarkable addition to my collection of prehistoric myths. In the beginning, a long, long time ago, there was the god Nareau, the creator. No one knew where he came from, no one knew who his parents were, for Nareau flew alone and asleep through the universe. In his sleep he heard his name called three times, but the one who called him was a 'nobody'. Nareau awoke and looked around him. There was nothing but emptiness, but when he looked down he perceived a large object. It was Te Bomatema ki, which means 'earth and heaven together'. Nareau's curiosity drove him to go down there and he paid a cautious visit to Te Bomatema ki. There were no living beings there, no men, only he, the creator. He circled the world he had discovered four times, from north to south and from east to west, and he was alone. Finally Nareau dug a hole in Te Bomatemaki and filled it with sand and water. He mixed them together to form rock and ordered the rock, together with the void, to bear Nareau Tekikiteia. That is how Nareau Tekikiteia, which means 'Nareau the Wise', came into being at the command of Nareau. Nareau, the creator, now ruled over Te Bomatemaki, whereas Nareau the Wise was on earth. They were able to 395"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"speak to each other and decided to separate the heavens from the earth. After great efforts their plan succe eded. Then Nareau the Wise created the first thinking beings, to whom he gave names such as these: Uka, which means the concentrated power to stir the air. Nabawe, which means the concentrated power of age. Karitoro, which means the concentrated power of energy. Kanaweawe, which means the concentrated power of dimension (distance). Ngkoangkoa, which means the concentrated power of time. Auriaria, which means the concentrated power of light. Nei Tewe nei, which means comet. That � then, is the commonest version of the myth about Nareau, though there are some variations. Arthur Grimble l supplies an important amplification: 'And when the work was done, Nareau the creator said: \"Enough. It is finished. I go, never to return.\" And he went, never to return, and no man knows where he lives from that day to this.' There are sparkling stones in this tradition that fit perfectly into the great mosaic of the gods-astronauts theory. The creation god Nareau flew alone and asleep in space, when someone, who was a nobody, called him by name and woke him. Lookin g at this from a modem standpoint, we can imagine an ideal spaceship whose pilot has been put into a deep sleep by a special process to check the activity of his body cells until he comes to a place which makes his organism start up again at a desired point in time. For some time space travel doctors have been discussing various types of physio­ chemical deep sleep to keep astronauts alive over long dis­ tances and periods of time until x hour. When the ship's computer confinns by radar that the spacecraft is approach­ ing a solar system, the deep sleep is tenninated. 'His name rang out and Nareau awoke.' The newly awakened pilot looks around him, but all he can see is the blackness of space, but below him he sees a planet from which the gravitational attraction of a solar system is effective. 'Then Nareau looked down and perceived a large object.' 3 9 6"},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"In possession of his faculties once again, the pilot decides to land on the third ideal planet of this solar system. 'Nareau stretched his limbs. He-wanted to know what kind of an object it was ... He went down and set foot on it cautiously .' The astronaut reconnoitres the whole planet from the air and recognises the prerequisites for life, but sees no kind of life. He decides to plant the seeds of lif e. 'At that time there were no spirits and no men, only the mighty Nareau.' Perhaps the methods used were too complic ated to find , their way into popular myths and be understood. For example, Nareau could have blown blue algae out of his spacesh ip. He could have diffused bacteria or, but less probably, scattered the seeds of hardy primitive types of plant. 'Nareau dug a hole in the earth and filled it with sand and water, he mixed them together to form rock ... and ordered [it], together with the void, to bear the earth [Nareau Tekikiteia]. That is how Nareau the Wise came into being.' It may be that the nickname 'the Wise' originally stood for 'spirit' or 'endowed with a soul'. Life now begins where once the sterile void reigned. From this prehistoric beginning two creative elements were active. Nareau, the creator of all being, and Nareau the Wise, who started terrestrial development. 'Nareau the creator was now over Te Bomate maki, whereas Nareau the Wise was on the earth .' But it is amazing to find a cre ation myth with concepts such as 'concen trated power of energ y', 'concen trated power of dimension', 'concen trated power of time', and 'concen­ trated power of light'. My imagination is not powerful enough to guess what the first Kiribatis understood by all this. Unwittingly they handed down clues to the powers of an inconceivable god. Nowadays it is easy to realise that the concentr ated power of light comes from the concentr ated power of energy. We know about the researches of Professor Eugen Sanger (1905-64) into photon drive for spacecraft, which, once outside the field of gravity of a solar system, could accelerate them to in­ credible speed s. Today we know that all acceleration is con­ nection with the 'concen trated power of dimension '. T h is acceleration implies the ability to cover vast distances, a pro­ cess which is coupled by a natural law to time ('concentrated 3 9 7"},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"power of time') and age (,conc entrated power of age'). Time dilatation is an empirically proved natural law. • The amplification by Arthur Grimblel of what I noted down in the stuffy library at Bairiki is important. 'And when the work was done, he said: \"Enough. It is finished. I go, never to return.\" And he went, never to return and no man knows where he lives from that day to this.' On interstellar journeys at very high speeds disappearance for ever is plausible. I seemed to hear that fantastic song by the pop group Jenghiz Khan :t They were called gods for there was no other word for the aliens. Yet in the books of the ancients it says that when the aliens come again we shall no longer exist. Only their traces remained on the earth. Water and sand had covered everyth ing, and no one knew what message they brought, the aliens. They were called gods for there was no other word for the aliens. I do not know who inspired the authors to write those words. When friends ask me if I was the author, I can swear under oath that I wasn't! The same questions crop up in all creation myths. How did our forefathers know that life on earth is of ex­ traterrestrial origin, that it was introduced by chance or according to plan? There were no witnesses to the creation of the Kiribatis -Nareau flew to our solar system while asleep and initiated lif e-o r of any other peoples. To whom could Nareau tell the story of his mission? Is it all the luxuriant imagination of the storytellers, with no real background? The Bible tells us that God created heaven and earth when the earth was still 'without fonn and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep'. So there was no reporter present at the biblical act of creation, either. As none of the traditional mytho logical acts of creation had eye-witnesses or chroniclers, yet creation myths are con­ centrated on one major event and handed down all over the world, the logical answer to all questions was obvious. Millions of years after the creati on, the god responsible • Acco rding to the Evidence. pp. 201. 204 . t Jupiter Records, No. 101777. 3 9 8"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"returned to the scene and told the men he had created about the events that lay so far back in the past-told them about their own creation. I can see ethnologists pulling sour faces as if they had been forced to suck a lemon, when they hear my simple explana­ tion of the origin of such puzzling myths. They say that we must take all the circumstances into consideration, put many possibilities together and accept the simplest explanations first. After a head long gallop the interpreta tion of pure science ends in clouds of psychological incense which bring tears to our eyes. Myths survive in different versions. For they are retold over endless stages from tribe to tribe, from family to family, sometimes with additions, sometimes with omissions. Every criminologist knows how widely the statements of witnesses of one and the same set of facts can differ. It takes com­ parisons and the rejection of subjective embellishments to disclose the core of what really happened. In the Kiribatis I also came across the story of Baby Terikiato, who was stolen and taken to the lady of heaven Nei Tetange niba. The lady flew away with the babe and brought him up as a demigod. In the west of the island, which is called 'the bird of Biiri', Terikiato, by now a young man, said to the lady of heaven, 'Look these birds are won­ derful, fo r they look like men.' By a magic spell the young man's foster-mother made his anns strong and his body powerf ul. Terikiato climbed on to the back of a bird and held it fast. The bird turned in circles, then flew up to heaven and 'they came into land of the heavenly ones'. There Terikiato stood before the house of the celestial lady Ne Mango Arei, who asked him, 'Where do you come from and what kind of creature are you? No man may visit me, for I am different from mankind.' In spite of the obvious difference they produced four children. They called the first one Niraki ni Karawa, which roughly means heaven circler. The legend expressly says that after the offspring were born Terikiato returned to earth and at first settled in Samoa.2 This story is reminiscent of the heavenly flight of the Babylonian Etana,· who rose from the earth on the back of • Gold of the Gods. pp. 12 {}-2 1. 3 99"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"A small airc raft jolted us high over the rough sea to Abaiang.

On the evening of my 'theoretical' day in the Bairika library I wonder ed if the tantalising myths had left tracks that were still warm, those tracks which Reverend Scarborough had put me on to. I could not wait for the morning. At 6 a.m. Teeta, our dark angel, took us to the airport, a thoroughly misleading description in comparison with air­ ports in our own latitudes. A twin-engined propeller-dr iven plane ferried us over the choppy sea to the island of Abaiang, which even in the early morning was steam ing in the op­ pressive heat. Inside a bamboo hut, the airport building, Teeta, waving his hands about and continually pointing to • Acco rding to the Eviden ce. pp. 12 4-5. 400"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"us, was talking to some men, two of whom set off at a trot and soon stopped near us with a Toyota lorry. They piled our luggage into it and rattled off with us over the deep potholes in the natural road, without sparing the vehicle. Abaiang is a narrow atoll 32 km long, flat as a board and smothered in lofty coconut palms and breadfruit trees, from which heavy fruit dangled . It took us two hours to cover two-thirds of the island's length. 'Teeta, do you know where the circle under taboo is?' I asked, when we stopp ed in the village of Tuarabu. He shook his head and confessed that he did not know the place him­ self, although he had lived on Abaiang as a boy when his father was minister there. However his mother, our cheerful hostess, had told him who to look for to lead us to our goal. Thank heavens! Teeta left us, as lig htfooted as a gazel le. We took a look at the settlement of 451 souls. As on all the islands, the huts were made from materials obtained from the coconut palm. Many of them stood on blocks of coral which aided ventilation and kept out the vermin and crabs which abound as well as preve nting the rapid rotting of the palm trunks in the muddy earth, which was even more im­ portan t. Some boys clamber ed up palms, which at a height of 30 metres provide fronds for roofing, and threw down nuts which the men skilfully cut open to offer us the milk in a gesture of welcome. In this heat coconut milk quenches the thirst better than a whole carton of Coca Cola. It consists of 45 per cent water, the rest being valuable albumen, fat, car­ bohydrates and minerals, offered free and in profusion by nature. Teeta reappeared in strange compan y. A skinny old woman shuffled along by his side. She was an uncanny figure in a kind of black robe, with a veil on her head . Her companion was a wrink led old man, who carried a whimpering baby under his left arm and dragged along a boy under school age with his right hand. None of them said a word. The baby seemed to be hungry, but I did not think the old lady's bosom was still a source of nourishment, if indeed she still had one under her robe. As we rattled off, packed like sardines in the back of the Toyota, Teeta lost his gaiety. 'Give the woman ten plugs of tobacco and a box of matches,' he whispered in his dry bari- 401"},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"tone. The nun in the black robe nodded; the old man bared his teeth which were brownish yellow stumps. Some consola­ tion, I thought, that even on the Kiribatis old age exacts its tribute and that not all islanders are good looking. At the southern tip of the island the Toyota braked sharply. The village was called Tebanga and here our com­ panions underwent a sudden change, as did the young people who had run up to see us. Laughter died away. Fear showed in everyone's eyes. Even Teeta, usually so cheerf ul, froze up. 'What's wrong?' I asked. Teeta silently shook his head towards the tropical green vegetation in front of us, but said nothin g. The nun in the habit walked into the bush on a path the width of a handker­ chief. We formed a silent procession behind her. Grandpa and the little boy began to whimper now, in addition to the baby. They were afraid. The old lady stopped and signalled to us to do the same. She emerged from the thicket into a clearing. A curtain of luxuriant tropical bushes hid her from sight. She advanced to perform the solemn ceremony, holding the stinking tobacco. What happened next took place against a background of noises-the songs and chatter of exotically coloured birds, the thunder of the nearby surf and the smack of our hands when we killed the mosquitoes which were tormenting us. In our opinion mosquitoes prefer the sweetness of the sinful foreigner's blood. Without wasting a glance on us, the old lady returned and walked past us. Teeta, his fear of evil spirits removed by the tobacco sacrifice, gave me a gentle push and said, 'Go on !' The clearing was a small space free of tropical under­ growth. It was obvious to me at first glance that nothing could grow ther e--4: ven without magic. The area was thickly carpeted with coral pebbles. Larger round stones marked out a rectangle in which stood a coral monolith the height of a man, like a gravestone, a suspicion which a walk round it confirmed. I saw the name and date of death of some islander carved on the stone. The plugs of tobacco were smouldering under a muss el shell the size of a tortoise. The three of us were alone. The islanders watched us curiously and fearfully from a safe distance. What we had found here had no connection with the mys- 402"},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"terious holy places mentioned by the Reverend Scarborough. Remembering that we must always be polite to the islanders, we swallowed our bitter disappointment, took a couple of photos and joined the phalanx of waiting natives. The old lady with the magical abilities felt that the effect of the tobacco sacrifice was confirmed and looked at us proudly. Grandpa and the baby whimpered; in fact they never stopped. Even the comparatively enlight ened Teeta submitted us to a critical scrutiny. Had his friends chang ed? Were they leaving the burial ground satisfied? But deep down we could not help feeling angry. Not until the Toyota was some distance from the place which was so uncanny and evil to the islanders did the spirits of our companions brighten. Teeta handed round a plastic flask containing a milky lukewarm brew. As no gif t must be refused, I overcame my revulsion and took a hefty slug, closely obser ved by everyone. I must have twisted my face into horrible grimaces, which Teeta took for those of a con­ noisseur, for he laughed delightedly, helped himself generously, then held the flask to the mouths of my friends. Besides the lady magician, Grandpa and the baby let the nectar run down their gullets and became tireder and tipsier every minute. 'What's this we're drinking, Teeta?' 'Sour toddy!' he replied as prosaically as if it had been a whisky sour. 'What ' is sour toddy?' He stopped the Toyota and point ed with the bluish tip of his index finger to the top of a coconut palm. Large and small bottles hung down from the branches under the leaves. The sugar-rich sap was being tapped. It had to stand fo r three days, then it started to ferment and knocked you over like new wine-a dangerously intoxicating drink which put the almost teetotal islanders out of action for hours. So the coconut palms even provide alcohol! The sour toddy worked like a sedative, otherwise I should have gone berserk! Back at Tuarabu, our starting point, the old men were standing round gossiping, just as they had been early that morning. Striving to be a civil European, I asked Teeta to find out about the place where we had been taken in error. Our dark angel discovered from his fe llow countrymen 40 3"},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"The circle under taboo lies in a rec tangle free of un aergrowth and covered with coral pebbles.

All honour to the warrior, I said, but our goal was a stone circle without a tomb, a sterile area, where even palms could not grow. If we could have heard the noise of the ideas revolving in the old men's heads, it would have sounded like mills tones at work. One could see from their expressions how they were racking their brains. A light gleamed in the eyes of one old fe llow. Yes, he said, there was such a circle in northern Tarawa. There, fr om time immemorial, dwelt a 'mighty spirit', who would not tolerate being disturbed, so that even birds which flew over 'his kingdom' fell to the ground dead. That was music to my ears-but was it really our goal? Before the sun rose from the sea on the fo urth morning of our island life, we went to dim l er at the house of head pilot Gil Butler, as invited.

He said that the island of 404"},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"Tamana mentioned by the Reverend Scarborough was 544 km away as the crow flies, whereas northern Tarawa could easily be reached by boat. He added that the next day he could fly us to Tamana for 225 Australian dollars per hour's flying time. I decided to accept this ofTer. The natural landing ground at Tamana did not look too good from above and this proved to be true on landing. The runways made by Air Tungaru are no more than narrow strips hacked out of the palm forest and roughly freed of stones and undergrow th.

They say, 'Eng, eng,' yes, yes, and a week later, the grass has grown again, the tropical rain has washed up more stones and animals are grazing and grunting again. Each landing and take-ofT demands treme ndous skill on the pilot's part. Our aircraft did a slalom between animals and stones. Teeta made for a palm hut in which three of the ground staff were loung­ ing. Our dark angel now knew exactly what we were looking for and explained to his countrymen, stimulating their im­ agination and memory with gestures and a torrent of words. Finally he approached with the three men. 'Over there are graves with very large beings!' 'Are you sure?' I asked. Teeta cross-examined them once more. They nodded and point ed straight across the landing strip to the hedge of palm trees. Draped with heavy gear, we marched ofT. High noon. The sun was perpendicularly over­ head . It grilled our bodies pitilessly. Sweat poured ofT us; it even ran into our shoes. Palef aces that we were, we dared not take our shirts off or we would have been one big blister in no time. Swarms of greedy mosquitoes bit us through our clothing. Our camera straps cut into our shoulders as if into raw meat. Graves covered with brown coral stones came into sight. 'Is that it?' I asked. My tongue was sticking to my gums with thirst and disappointment. 'Tiaki, tiaki. No, no, it's further on,' said the ground stafT, cutting their way through the dense undergrowth, dodging round palm trees, climbing over mounds of stones and graves until they beamingly announced, 'That's it!' We looked blank and disappointed. Teeta sensed that this was still not the right place. He turned away in embarrass­ ment and scratched his enviably thick hair. 405"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"How were we going to make any progress? The locals were willing and doing their best. It was up to us. 'Teeta,' I began caref ully, 'tell the men I am gratef ul for bringing us here and that we are surpri sed to see so many ancient graves, but that the graves we are looking for are very large, much larger than these. They were built for giants who were twice and three times as big as you and I. And these graves must be located somewhere on their own, not in the middle of a burial field like this one, for the giant men would not tolerate either life or death anywhere near them .' Our indefatigable interpreter entered the circle of men, who looked quite cheerful in spite of the burning sun and op­ pressive air. I could see that Teeta was doing his utmost to explain what the white men wanted to see. One of them started to talk to our fr iend and assur ed him that there were larger graves at the end of the island, larger than the biggest one here. 'Are there other graves in the vicinit y?' I asked. 'Eng, eng,' yes, yes, they agreed enthusiastically. I realised that we would only be on the wrong track agai n. I took paper and pencil fr om Willi, sat on a grave and questioned Teeta about the circle. 'Is the grave you're talking about bigger than any grave here?' 'Eng, eng.' I called to a man and asked him to draw the burial mound. He did so with rudimentary lines. 'Now draw the other graves surrou nding the big one.' He drew the layout of a whole cemetery. It was not the place we were looking for. Obviously politeness prevented the Kiribatis from saying 'no' to a foreigner when they could not satisf y his wishes. I dreamed up a story. 'Listen. A long time ago there were two big men, much bigger than Teeta. They came from a distant land, perhaps even from heaven . They were so strong that they could throw the canoes of your fa thers into the air like coconuts. Your people made them drunk and conquered them with a magic chann. Then they killed them and threw their bones into a deep grave so that they could never cause trouble agai n. Do you know where those graves are?' They listened attentively to Teeta's translati on. After a 406"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"lengthy silence and much deliberation, a man stepped out of the group. 'One tomb of the giants lies at the southern tip of the neighbouring island of Arorae .' 'Are there also large stones which point to islands lying far out to sea?' Yes, the man assur ed me, he had seen such stones when he lived on Aror ae with his father. The island was not visible from our present locati on. At a distance of 80 km, it was the furthest south of the sixteen Kiribati islands. Ought we to risk flying there on such vague information? Owing to the strike Gil Butler had only a limited amount of petrol, but by now he was so infected with the prospecting fever, that he overruled us. Within half an hour his aircraft was hopping down the runway. It was two o'clock and the equatorial sun was beating down as strongly as at noon. Arorae, too, boasted three natives dozing in the shade of a shelter made of palm fronds; here\" too, animals were grazing on the runway. But the ground staff had bicycles! Teeta asked the usual questions and we were directed to an old man who was reputed to be well versed in the local topography. We swung into the saddles of two rusty old bik�s. The lively old man, flattered at being asked to give in­ formation, explained with a wealth of gesture were the giants' graves and the navigation stones were to be found. With renewed hope, I reflected that the island was only 4.5 km long and a few hundred metres wide, so that anyone who'd grown old there must know it like the back of his hand. When I asked Teeta to chase up more bicycles, the news spread like wildfire. Four teen strong, we cycled back to the so-called airport. I pressed coins into the hands of the riders whose cycles we had asked to rent and our expedition set off on the 4 km stretch, which is no distance under civilis ed con­ ditions. In Arorae it was a cross-country rally of the most testing kind-through quagmires and fine sand, across ilI­ kept fields through luxuriant tropical undergrowth, con­ stantly tormented and attacked by swarms of mosquitoes. The old man had lived up to his promise. On the northern tip of Arorae, directly behind the manea ba, the community house, there was a rectangle marked out with neatly arranged flat stones. The stone wall rose one 407"},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"The second giant's grave was destroyed to make room for this maneaba. the commun ity house of Arorae. metre above ground. There were no graves or gravestones. Five paces from the putative giant's grave was a squar e shal­ low hole. The sunlight was reflected from the water it con­ tained . The Reverend Scarborough had mentioned two giant graves. Where was the second? Teeta found out that years ago, when the maneaba was built, the islanders needed extra space and had removed the second grave . They were not afraid to do so, because there was nothing left of the spirits' magic or the giants' bodies . Whether terrestrial or extraterrestrial giants had been buried here, I was not surprised that the spirits had evaporated, their bones dissolved in the brackish water. So now we stood in front of a burial mound measuring 5.3 by 2.9 m. There was no question of rummaging about under the pile of stones-what was to be found? Besides Gil Butler had to be back before nightfall . At all events we should depart with the definite impression that this was an ancient myth- 408"},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"Leaving Arorae Airport. ological grave. We paid a silent tribute to the memor y of the Reverend Scarborough and asked ourselves where the navi­ gation stones were . We were told that they were at the oppo­ site end of the island, far beyond the landing strip. If it had not been for the ubiquitous strike, we should have taken it easy and flown back another day, but we had to make the most of what was presumably our only chanc e. The rally was repeated, but there was no question of cycling, once we had left the primitive country track. Dehydrated as we were, our march through the sand dunes was torture. Sometimes I found myself having hallucinations of the kind described by desert travellers saved from death by thirst. My heartbeats hammered in my temples and echoed in my head .

Another groove pointed south-east to West Samoa, 1900 km away as the crow flies to the east of the Fiji Islands. A third line was aimed at the Tuamotu Islands in the South Pacific, 4700 km away as the crow flies, and after that approximately at the Hawaiian Islands. Once again a thank-you winged through ,the air to the Reverend- Scarborough at Cape Town! Two of the navigation stones were made of granite, which does not exist on Arorae, three had the characteristics of volcanic stone and the others consisted of material from th e coral reef. I toy�d with many of the ideas which always crop up when I am confronted �ith prehistoric navigational problems, as I was here on Arorae. It is unanimously accepted that the islanders have always been able to solve simple navigational problems with the help of the stars and their knowledge of curren ts. But this does not solve the biggest puzzle of all, how the first, the very first, seafarers reached goals of whose existence they had no inkling. When they set sail from the coasts of their home island, they did not know where they would land, nor had they any idea how long the voyage would last. If the goal was just anywhere, experience gained on the outward voyage would not help their return, because the stars change their positions, and currents and winds do not stay in one direction. If we accept, as is done today, stars, currents and winds as navigational aids, we presuppose that the earliest seafarers knew about difficult aspects of astronomy, marine currents and wind movements, a state of knowledge which had not been generally reached by our early forefathers. I remembered a recent conversation with the ethnologist Dr Robin Watt in the museum at Wellington, New Zealand. Questio ned about such navigational problems, Watt claimed Stones as tall as a man, com pass stones, point to distant islands. Many of them have collap sed, eaten by wind and weather. 412"},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"that he could not see any difficulty. The Maoris, for example, the Polynesian people of New Zealand, knew that there were archipelagos to the north-east, such as the present-day Fijian, Tonga and Samoan Islands. So all-they had to do was steer in a general north- easterly direction in order to reach land somewher e among the network of islands. Once they had landed, the local inhabitants would help them to sail fu rther. At first this sounds quite reasonable, but then doubts about this 'solution' of the problem arise. Setting off in a 'general north -easterly direction' presupposes a precise idea of what that means and especially the know ledge that there are islands in the sea somewhere in that direction. Catamarans, rowing­ boats, canoes and even sailing boats could easily sail right through the wide-meshed net of islands without making a landf all. A journey to 'somewher e', with no return! Obviously there are navigational aids for the exper ienced seaman even when there is no land in sight: refuse carried by the waves, tree-t runks, the bodies of animals. But they are minor aids which are of little use at night or in stormy seas. When I hear all the explanations and check them, I feel that the prehistoric seafarers must have known their goal very precisely before they set forth and that they took plenty of supplies with them. Did they operate on the basis of knowledge acqui red over the centuries or were they instructed by their mythological 'gods'? Who brought the stones here? Who put them in position? Who knew about the specific directions in which 'invis ible' islands lay? The only concr ete witnesses in a desert of ques­ tions are the navigation stones which stand before us in the glaring sun and the mythologies of the Pacific which without excepti on speak of flying beings, their 'gods'. A central myth is the legend of the bird Rupe, which is attributed to the Maoris, but nevertheless appears among other peoples in countless varia tions. According to one version, Hina, one of Rupe's sisters, married Tinirau, who took his wedded wife to a distant island, made her pregnant and shut her up in a house which he surroun d ed with a 'protective screen'. This not only pre­ vented Hina from leaving the house, but also stopped strangers from forcing their way in. When the time to give birth approached, there was no one to assist Hina. In her 414"},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"need she cried out, 'Rupe! Rupe! Come and help me.' Soon there was a whirring noise above the house and the bird Rupe shouted to his sister, 'I'm here, Hina!' . The bird Rupe could not reach his sister until he had bored a hole in the protective screen. After a difficult birth, Hina asked to be flown back home. But first Rupe was to evacuate Tinirau and his countrymen and then she would follow. Rupe explain ed that he would have to ascend into the sky th ree times. The islanders clung to Rupe's back. He flew them far away and tipped them into the sea. After three flights, he collected Hina and her baby. High in the air, Hina saw bodies and articles of clothing floating in the sea. She asked why he had killed them. Rupe replied, 'They did you wrong when you lived in their country. They imprisoned you and no one helped you during childbirth. So I was angry and threw them all into the sea'. 5 Our Rupe was a strange charter plane! The Kiribati legend of Te Bongi Ro, the 'Black Darkness ', relates that those who dwelt in heaven landed before men existed . Before their return they left a founding father behind on every large island. The names of these legendary fathers are interesting-Bai Matoa, Matinaba and Matiriki and the rest-for they all correspond to descriptions of stars and const ellations. Are these tracks that are still hot enough to lead us to the begetters of the navigation stones? The ancient temple ofTe Mahara on the island of Raivavae jn French Polynesia is still consider ed to be the point where the mythological god Maui landed after his space flight. 6 There is a similar legend originating from the first inhabitants of Atu Ona, one of the Marquesas Islands. On it is the small mountain of Kei Ani, which is looked on as a temple, al­ though there are no signs of a man-made building. The first Polynesians called the mountain Mouna tuatini-etua, 'Mou ntain of Many Gods', or Mouna tautini-etua, literally, 'Mountain, on Which the Gods Lande d'.7 I get no special pleasure from proving my hypothes es with so many myths and legends from the Pacific. It is no effort on my part, there is such an abun d ance of them. So I shall play some aces from my hand . Legend says of Ta'aroa, the god of creation of the Society Islands: 'Ta'aroa sat in his mussel, in the darkness of eternity. 415"},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"The mussel was an egg which drove through endless space. There was no heaven, no land, no sea, no moon, no sun, there were no stars. All was darkness, dense all-pervading darkness .' 8 During the last centur y venerable priests told eth­ nologists about the god 10: '10 moved through the infinity of space. The universe was in darkness, there was no water any­ where. There was no trace of sunrise, no brightness, no light.' 8 The oldest legends have this to say about the god Tagaloa on the Samoan Islands: 'The god Tagaloa floated in the void, he created everything, he was alone. Before him there was no heaven, no land, he was all alone and slept in the vastness of space. Nor was there any sea, nor did the earth exist then. His name was Tagaloa fa'atutupu nu'u which means some­ thing like \"cause of grow th\".' 9 Hawaii, presumably influenced by Christian missionaries, has the triune god Ku kau akahi, a contraction of the names of the gods Ku, Kane and Lono. Kane is the creator, who created men 'in his own imag e'.9 Needless to say, Kane came from the darkness of space. The prayers offered to him prais e his home at the finnament: The wandering stars, the immovable stars, the moving stars of Kane, countless are these stars. The big stars, the small stars, the red stars of Kane. o infinite universe! The great world of Kane, the great sun of Kane, ' they move in the vast expanses of the universe. Today if you ask the Kiribatis, Maoris or any other islanders about their traditions, you will meet with in­ compreh ension. They no longer know anything about their ancient gods. Missionary activity in the Pacific buried ancient cultures, set up new ones and banned the oral transmission of 'heathen' memories. For what is left we can thank the 416"},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"ethnologists who, at the turn of the century, recorded what was told them. The ethnologist Robert Aitken has described what a Sisyphean task it was. S 'It was disappointing to find that most people admi tted they knew nothing about pre-Christian sagas. Almost every­ one could repeat psalms or long passages from the Bible, but very few could or would tell me what must have been common knowle dge before the introduction of the Bible.' Thus old, important, undoubtedly explosive know ledge disappears into the maws of time. It is absurd when towns and unique buildings are bombed to dust and ashes in today's crazy wars. But when important evidence of our common past is wiped out with the palm of peace in the hands of clergymen, it is downright madness. I cannot prove it, but I am sure that there must have been references to the compass stones of Arorae in the old traditions if they had not been zealously rooted out. So five stones stand there upright and point to distant goals with their grooves, while eight mono­ liths lie half a metre above ground. We shall never learn what technique enabled the primitive islanders to aim at unkno wn points in the open sea. The government of the Kiribatis, which has not been in power long, does nothing to preserve the stones .' They are known only to a few old men and they have not got the secret of eternal life. We arrived in Tarawa as night was fa lling. We were met at the airport by Father Hegglin, a Swiss compatriot, and Dr Rosina Hassig, who was working for the World Health Organisation at Tarawa HospitaL The tea, relic of English colonial days, that we drank with Dr Hassig moistened our parched throats and restor ed our spirits. Naturally I could not wait to ask her about the legendary magical circle that was reputed to exist in north Tarawa. 'Never heard of it,' she said, but added after a moment's thought, 'If anyone knows about it, it's our medical superi ntendent. He is from here, grew up in north Tarawa, studied in America and then came back home.' Without fu rther ado she took me to see the superintendent to whom I put my question straight out so as not to bother him unduly , He gave us a benevolent appraising look, as do all consult­ ants, and diagnosed the case. 417"},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":"'Why do you want to find the circle?' 'May I conclude from your Question that this magic circle exists?' 'Yes, it does. For untold gener ations it has been taboo and my coun trymen are convinc ed that it is fatal to anyone who enters it. Do not get any wrong ideas, . it is no enormous giant circle. It's comparatively small and its centre is laid out with a rectangle of small stones. If you will take my advice, do not visit the circle !' That wasn't diagnosis, but therapy by a skilful doctor who knew how to wield the scalpel� 'Are you superstitious?' I asked with a grin. He laughed . No, he said, he did not believe in ghosts and spirits. Ultimately there was a scientifically possible explana­ tion for everything, but until one was found we should not casually dismiss the experience of his compatriots during long years of observing what went on in the magic circle. For example, they had noticed that animals which ran through the circle contracted mysterious diseases. 'Was there any Question of radioactivi ty? , I intervened. No, that could be excluded because artificial radioactivity had only existed since the work of Marie Curie in 1903, whereas the odd hap­ penings had been observed from the earliest times. The head doctor had no explanation for me, but he confirmed the existence of the magic circle mentio n ed by the Reverend Scarborough. Although there was no service at all, we were still staying at the government hotel Otintai, in spite of the strike. We were allow ed to stay and that was a good thing, because all our destinations were easier to reach than if we had accepted Teeta's repeated invitation to his parents' house. Our dark angel came fo r us at 7 a.m. In spite of the strike he had laid on a boat and three cans of petrol so that we could chug off to northern Tarawa. After an hour and a half's journey through the lagoon we reached an islet barely as big as a football ground . Teeta asked for five plugs of tobacco and matches. I still had them on me and was glad to get rid of the smell. At first I had thought the stink would keep the mosquitoes at bay, but they love the scent of heathen smoke sacrifices. Teeta took tobacco and matches from me and used his right hand to throw them into the water over 418"},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"his left shoulder. 'Why are you doing that?' I asked. He said that this was the place w here one had to ofTer a sacrifice to the sea god, to ensur e a safe return. Although he was a parson's son, Teeta's Christian faith did not seem to have a very deep and convincing foundation. Like everybody else when the pastor was not watching, he still propitiated the spirits for saf ety's sake. We were half-way there when he paid tribute to the sea spirit. Thousands of crabs were scuttling along the beach of north Tarawa. Prepared in advance, we took Teeta's polite an­ nouncement that he had to ask the natives about the location of our circle as a necessar y civility. We waited. We waited three whole hours in the burning sun. Had it not been for the Reverend Scarborough 's impressive warning, 'Never bathe in the sea,' we should have been only too glad to plunge into the clear water. Friendly, smiling islanders paid their respects to us and gave us coconut milk to drink. Once again Teeta returned with a small Toyota lorry . Again he was accompanied by an old man who showed the way to the magic circle. He guided us to a clearing in the tropical undergrowth with a squar e marked out by stones inside it. At the top, outside the enclosure, was a large inver ted muss el. Thank heavens it wasn't a tombstone! That was my first thought and then I was silent. Our trio exchanged hesitant looks. The talk of dang erous magic had infected us. We suddenly felt rather faint-hearted but sensed that we had to put on a brave front for the anxious natives. Teeta 's gaze rested on us, silently saying, 'Friends, give up! Don't tempt the spirits!' We took our bearings. Before us lay a circle 14 m in diam­ eter and in its centre a square with sides of 5.1 m marked out by small oblong stones. This squar e was the only remarkable fe ature. Not a plant, not a blade of grass grew in it, although there was luxuriant vegetation all round. Admittedly the square was dotted with pebbles, but there was still enough space between them for something green to thrive. In the tropical hothouse heat, ground that is cleared today is over­ grown tomorrow. Moreover, no palm trees grew towards the zone that was taboo, but that could have been coinci­ dence. In spite of the head doctor's warning not to expect any- 419"},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"thing colossal, we were disappointed. To look as if we were doing something, we aimed our Geiger counters along both diagonals of the square. The pointer did not budge. When Willi made to enter the square, Teeta held him back in an iron grip. This was very odd, because we had not had to appease any evil spirits with vile-smelling tobacco. Like spec­ tators watching a big match on the centre court at Wimbledon, the natives could not take their eyes off us. We paced off the ground close to the magic circle, but found absolutely nothing worthy of note, just jungle full of rampant vegeta tion. It still seemed odd that it came to an abrupt halt outside the circle. Was there a family clan which kept it clear-because of tradition or to make fools of out­ siders? Why should a family lumber itself with this work just for the sake of a practical joke? Conditio ned by the climate, the islanders make .only the minimum effort needed for exist­ ence. I approached the old man and asked him if there was a priest or village sage who could tell us about the island's past. 'Eng, eng,' he nodded and led us to a hut outside which a corpulent man sat like a Buddha. Forewarned, I fished for tobacco and matches. The Buddha lit the smoke sacrifice and we crouched in a half-circle round him, like the others. In guttural English that grate� on our ears, the Buddha told us that the circle we had seen was reigned over by the oldest and mightiest of the spirits. He would not tolerate any kind of life in its vicinity and even killed birds which flew over it. There were a few more similar areas on the island, but the one we had seen belong ed to a powerf ul spirit. Anyone who disregarded warnings of his power would soon pay for it with his life. 'How does he die?' I want ed to know. The Buddha intoned, 'We do not know, no one knows, the spirit kills with his power.' For years I have visited the holy places of all kinds of religions at which miracles have happened. These miracles happen at Lourdes, Fatima, the Convent of San Giovanni Rotonda, Guadeloupe and Iborra; they happen all over the world . The preva iling view is that faith, the ardent will to be healed , works the miracle. There must be a reason for mir­ aculous cures attested by doctors. It is a positive miracle- 420"},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"working fa ith which only unbel ievers dismiss contemptuously as supers tition. I asked myself whether negative results could not be affected by similar psychological impulses. Frivolous visitors, permeated with the deadly power of the magic circle, still close to belief in gods and spirits, suffer death or disease as soon as they enter the zone which is taboo. Perhaps that is the explanation of the events which the islanders have been recounting since the distant past and in which they still be­ lieve. I share the medical superintenden t's view that mysterious magical phenomena will be given a logical s C ientific explana­ tion at some time or other, but I doubt if they will be found by academic thinking. Research which seeks to measure, count and weigh everything categor ically excludes what cannot be weighed or measur ed. But there are powers which cannot be captured even with the most delicate technical in­ strum ents. The Kiribatis' early forefathers related (and their living descen dants confirm it) that the magic circle brings death. I could not find anything extraordinary, but I am not arrogant enough to claim that the islanders are the naive victims of their belief in spirits. So long as unusual phenom­ ena cannot be measured, weighed and counted, they will be dismi ssed as miracles or supersti tions. Until the day when a convincing explanation is given, the stone circles . of Aror ae can be registered as a miracle, with the proviso of Michael Faraday (1791-1867) that nothing is too wonderf ul to be true. Teeta did something I would not have dared to do as a foreigner. He stopped the garru lous Buddha in full flow and urged us to leave. He wanted to finish the trip through the lagoon before the onset of darkness so that his watchf ul pilot's eye could steer us round the knife-sharp coral reefs which had sliced through many a boat before. In addition, sharks and octopuses wanted their supper in the evening. We were happy to follow our dark angel, because we had no desire to watch a fight between a native and an octopus. One man acts as living bait and swims into its clutches. Then at the precise moment when the octopus wraps its tentacles, tactile organs for seizing its food, round its prey, a companion leaps into the water and kills the creatur e by biting it between the eyes. 1 We did not witness one of these gruesome combats, 421"},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"although they are still suppos ed to take place as a sport in the southern Kiribati Islands. Thank heavens, too, we did not have to see sharks being caught. Once they have been lured by bait of meat, divers cut up their bodies with sharp knives. Sharks' genitals are highly prized by the islanders as aids to virilit y-sex aids from the sea. The method of killing smaller fish as long and as thick as an arm is unchanged. The fisher­ man sticks the hooked fish in his mouth like a flash and bites its head off. 10 It is said that many nativ es only lisp because the fish bit quicker than they did. The ebb tide dragged our boat more than a kilometre out to sea. Ten islanders waded out to us. The sun sank on the horizon in a purplish-r ed ball of fire. With the help of the islanders we pushed and dragged the boat in. Crabs crawling over our feet and calves felt most unple asant. The lights of Baraiki twinkled in the darkness and were reflected in the entrance to the harbour of south Tarawa. Beach fires flickered. Oil lamps made of coconut shells smoked in the huts. The palm groves were full of lovers. Songs floated over this island paradise. Night had fallen on the Kiribatis. My curiosity was not satisfied; there was still a trail to be pursued . I gave Teeta the Reverend Scarboro ugh's letter to read. I mentioned the footprints of the giants said to be the footmarks of the gods as they walked throughout the islands. They are very large, perfectly shaped footsteps in the rocks and are found on nearly all the islands. Some are to be found just outside the village of Antebuka, almost on the sea side of the island, but there are much better examples on other islands. If you walk about 300 yards from Antebuka towards the nearest habitation you will find them in the rocks about 50 yards from the sea-line. If you have some idea that perhaps the island ers themselves have caref ully carved these prints in the rocks ... then you must ask yourself why? For what purpose should the islanders on 16 islands undertake to manufacture marks in the hard rock? Bear ing in mind that they hav e little or no tools, that would be nonsense. The local verbal customs say that they are the footprints of gods who came from heaven. 4 22"},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"The fact that we had not yet seen the Reverend Scarborough 's footprints did not mean much, because we had not asked about them, but it seemed astonishing that even Teeta looked at us uncomprehe ndingly. But the hunting fever had us in its grip; equipped with such precise data, we set out hunting for the fourth time. The area so accurately defined in the letter was an absolute abomination. If my readers might suspect from previous de­ scriptions that Tarawa was a paradise of ideal beauty and sweet odours, I must let them see the other side of the coin. The stretch of 50 yards from the waterline was one big cloaca. The islanders have no WCs in or near their huts. Since the days of their ancestors they relieve themselves on parts of the beach. So that the backsides of their lovely bodies are not pinched by octopuses or tickled by other water fauna, huts on piles have been built in the water. In urgent need they can reach across two palm trunks which sway like tightropes. At flood tide natives drunk on sour toddy can relieve themselves into the sea, at ebb tide on the rocks far below. These WC huts are insular communications centres. Kiribatis crouch next to each other on the thunder seat for hours, exchanging news-a community united in the same business. This centuries' old custom of leaving human waste on the beach for the sea to remove had a logical extension when the blessings of civilisation came to Kiri bati. Unlike human refuse, tin cans and Cola bottles, plastic wrappings and broken tools, do not decay, nor are they all carried far out by the tide to destructi on. Back from the sea, they disintegrate on the beach -slowly or not at all. This was the aspect of the 'catchment area' pinpoint ed so accurately by the Reverend Scarborough. After our previous experiences, we had to take this indication seriously, too. Whether our search was too cursory in the absence of gas­ masks or because we were upset by the news that flying would stop owing to the strike, I don't know, at any rate we left the beach near the village of Antebuka without stumbling on the giants' track s. After lunch, Teeta came up, all smiles. He had spent the break doing some research. He said we ought to go to the village of Banr eaba where there were footsteps of the kind 423"},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"we were looking for on land belonging to a relation of his. The plot was called Te Aba-n-Anti -'Pl ace of the Spirits'­ or Te Kananrabo-' Holy Place'. This information actually did lead us to footprints of vari­ ous sizes. A giant must have walked on incredibly large feet to leave prints 1.37 m long by 1.14 m wide stamped in the rock like greetings from prehistory. One left footprint had 12 toes and a palm tree was g{ow ing out of it. Odd. The giant with the enormous feet was obviously accompanied by others with smaller feet, some of them presumably children. Most fo otprints had six toes on both feet and were impr essed a good centimetr e into the ground . In the library I found a copy of The Footprints of Tarawa 11 edited by the Polynesian Society. It had informative fo otnot es about the giants' prints. According to legend, they were made by the giant Tabua riki, who was so tall that he could pick coconuts from the tops of palm trees without stretching. He has his place in the legend 'Te Bongi Ro', the black darkness. Acco rding to this tradition he was one of the second crew of celestial beings who are supposed to have landed on the island of Banaba. And where does the palm tree come from? In the fortieth year of this century it was planted by a clergyman so that it would overgrow the legend about Tabuari ki, the gentle art of botanic missionary work. The Footprints of Tarawa, which was scrupulously docu­ mented, mentioned several places with giant's footpri nts. I would have loved to visit them, but the comparatively close targets could not be reached without a boat or an aircraft. Owing to the strike they were as remote as the moon. So I had to leave the sites near Banreaba for others to investigate. According to the most recent research, the Kiribatis have been inhabit ed for at least 3000 years. Three thousand years without a written tradition is a very, very long time. The 'gods' were quite right to leave the rock with permanent traces which would testif y to their presence into the distant fu ture. We must ask ourselves how such footprints originated. An obvious idea is that they were chiselled out of the rock. The On the edge of the village of Banreaba we found prehistoric footprints, ' both gigantic and normal. Most of them have six toes on each foot. 425"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"samples that we saw and photographed did not give this impression. They had natural curves round heel and toes. The alternative theory that they were made by people of enormous weight collapses. Many tons would have had to be pressing on the soles of the feet. More conceivable than that is the absurd idea that the landing legs of a scout-craft from a spaceship were\" perpetuating themselves. More plausible is the possibility that the prints originated when the rock was still hot and pliable-or had not yet acquired its present-day form. The prints of naked feet pressed into a layer of fine volcanic ash can become tufa by weathering and so preserve the traces. Even the outlines of feet pressed into clay can dry out over the centuries and petrify. J do not know when the giant footprints to be found in many parts of the world will find a convincing scientific explanation so long as visits by extraterrestrials are excluded. We learnt from Gil Butler that an Air Nauru plane would fly to Nauru next morning, possibly the last for some time as the strike was disrupting flights more and more. We would willingly have tacked a few days on to our original week and-in spired by the islanders' timeless sense of time-we almost did ' so, if we had not faced up to our Western end-of ­ term feeling on the eve of the flight. We ate our supper sadly as if it had been a last meal before an execu tion. We tried to work out if the long journey to the Kiribatis had been worth while. We had seen one of the giant's graves mention ed by Reverend Scarborough, we had seen the magic circle. Now we knew that this evidence of a distant past existed, that they were still taboo to the present-day islanders, even though they all profess to belong to an import ed religi on. We could not fathom the reasons for their fear of the magic circle. And then there were the navigation stones whose goals we had verified with maps and compass. For how much longer would they bear silent witness to the navigational abilities of prim­ aeval islanders? Exposed to wind and weather the stone mys­ teries will crumble to dust. The giant footsteps also existed. The Reverend Scarborough who had spent three and a half years on the island had given us hard facts. The best kind of proof of the former existence of ex- 426"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"traterr estrials is in the traditions. Nareau, who flew through the cosmos while asleep and was awoken by a cry, the bird Rupe, who appeared noisily and evacuated the inhabitants of an island, the names of worsh ipped beings from space, whose names stand as synonymous for the first gods . . Bwere was there to say goodbye, bringing greeti ngs from Teeta's friendly mother. He smiled indulgently. 'In a short time on our islands you have seen mysterious places which I haven 't seen in my 35 years. You have achieved much, but I don't envy you-I don't want to be a Europea n. When do you rest, when do you have inner peace? Where do you get the energy for your frenzied existence? You reach your goal, but you squander your life.' On the edge of the runway, with the engines turning, I could not explain to Bwere what drove me on or where I got the energy from. It is the pressur e present even when I am asleep, it is the desire to get on the trail of the 'gods' regard­ less of where in the world they manif est themselves. Teeta, our dark angel , stood to one side. He looked at me trustingly. He asked, 'Will the old gods return?' 'They will, Teeta, they certa inly will.'

It is as if they themselves were continually asking permission to take the floor. With so much new and exciting material, I feel as if the stones are addressing me; I cannot relegate them to the archives yet. Every tourist in England is advised to look into the mystery of these silent witnesses from prehistoric times. He will not have to look far.

To my way of thinking Rollright and Stone henge can serve as repres entative of the other 900, for they were the scene of the exciting discoveries, the results of which are undoubtedly applicable to the other mega lithic centres as well. The mists and shadows of 5000 years of past enshroud Stone h�nge. The experts are at least unanimous on this dating. They date the first stage of its construction to 2800 BC, in the Neolithic, the Late Stone Age, the third epoch in the history of mankind that began in the sixth millennium BC. The great pyramid of Cheops in Egypt had not yet been built, nor was the Sphinx crouching in the desert at Gizeh. If we accept the most widely held hypothesis, some archi­ tect must have set to work around this time. It is hardly credible that he undertook the planning on his own account without a patron or employer. The complex was on too gigantic a scale for that. Who were the builders? Stone Age priests or mighty rulers? We cannot find out, for writing had not yet been invented, a state of affairs which must certainly have been a major obstacle to the extensive planning. The brilliant archi tect who made a start at some point in time could refer to centuries of observations of sun, moon and stars, or so it seems if we look at the rock-hard facts. Many generati ons must have marked out the light and shadow of sunrise and sunset on the ground, and studied the phases of the moon and movements in the firmament. We shall never know how these astronomical data were handed down, for, as I have said, there was no writing then. All w e know is that when zero hour came in St onehenge the archi tect must have had a mass of proven information at his disposal and that the wealth of accurate data was collected through observ ations over long periods without any kind of technical aid. Ostensibly on the basis of this traditional knowledge and with a commission unlimi ted in scope in the bag the archi tect took a look at his workmen's tools, which were made of flint. bone and wood, and realised that his task of erecting a temple fo r celestial observ ations would take a thousand years. So he relied on f u ture generati ons carrying on the good work after his impressive beginning, especially as the preci sion he sought for did not perm it botched workmanship.

The first stage consisted of a circular enclosure with an entr�nce of two large blocks of stone and the so-called Heel Stone outside the circle. Later a second stone circle was set up inside the wall-like enclosure for accurate predictions of celestial phenomena, e.g. sunset at the winter solstice or moonrise at the summer solstice. It was marked out by 56 holes which probably held poles in order to aim at specific . sight lines. So that they could move accurately within the mathe­ matically fixed points, the constructors adopted from the 'int ernational bureau of weights and measures' the Megalithic Yard of 82.9 cm, which remained the unit of measure for thousands of years. The first archit ect was not only a brilliant mathematician and astronomer, he was also a formidable clairvoyan t. He included 4.5 tons of heavy stone colossi in his pl an.

For all archaeologists agree that there was none. And I wonder how they could anticipate the future and make use of the theorem of Pythagoras, who lixed c. 570 BC, i.e. more than 2000 years after building began, in the ground plan of St oneheng e. I do not understand it. Which came first, the chicken or the egg? King James I (1603-25) wanted to know more about the confused mass of stones at Stonehenge. And as kings can act without parliamentary authorisation, he wasted no time in commissioning his court architect and stage designer Inigo Jones (1573- 1652) to get to the heart of the matter. Jones was impr essed by the primaeval complex. He noted some 30 stones, each weighing about 25 tons and 4.3 m high, arran ged in a recognisable circle, even though some of them had fa llen. He observed that the standing stones had pro­ jecting pegs and that the lintels had holes to receive them. Jones sketched a monolithic circle of five great trilithons made of sarsen, a greyish-yellow sandstone, and the massive undr essed Heel Stone outside the inner ring. What did Inigo Jones tell the king? He said that Stone henge was the ruins of a Roman temple inscribed to Coelus. Some years after this investigation a trilithon-two upright stones with a lintel-f ell on to the so-called Altar Stone. On 3 January 1779 the next of the stone gateways collaps ed.l The teeth of time were gnawing at Stonehenge. It looks as if kings took more interest in our mysterious past than the potentates of our own day do. They can barely cope with the present, let alone the future. King Charles II commissioned John Aubrey, an antiquary, who had studied the stone circle at A vebur y 30 years previ ously, to visit Stonehenge. In 1678 Aubr ey register ed 56 holes, which have since been known as Au brey Holes. What did Aubrey tell the king? He said that the idea of its being a Roman temple was nonsense; it was much more probably an ancient Druidical sanctuary . 434"},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"The Druids (Irish: great sages)? These priests of the Celts, said Aubrey, were versed in a secret doctrine and were fa r advanc ed in astrono m y. They could be reasonably accepted as the master builders of the enormous complex. Members of the present-day Order of Druids still assemble at Stoneheng e at the summer solstice and sing as they await the sun, which rises exactly above the Heel Stone, looking eastwards from the middle of the Altar Stone. Over 200 years later, in 1901, Sir Joseph Norman Lockyer (1836-1920) looked into the phenomenon of Stoneheng e and he was the first astronomer to make a fundamental study of the stone witnesses from ancient times. Lockyer was an outstanding expert in his field. He was Director of the Solar Physics Observatory in South Kensington, a pioneer of astrophysics and the discoverer of helium, which was unknown on earth until then. Lockyer's astronomical studies led him to date the monu­ ment to 1860 BC, plus or minus two centuries. It makes no difference . This date was long before the Celtic period . Celts are first heard of in the sixth century, BC. That put paid to the theor y of a Druidical sanctuary. Investigation of Stoneheng e became more active in our own century. Scholars found flint axes and sandstone ham­ mers, and they were puzzled about the origin of the material. There were sandstone quarries within a 30 km radius, but no place where bluestone could be found. Nevertheless, blue­ stones were there in profusion. In 1923 Dr Thorn, working for the Ordnance Survey, took over the quest and found that the bluestones came from a small deposit in the Prescelly Mountains in Pembrokeshire. The discovery had one blemish. Presce lly is 385 km from Stonehenge. If we accept Presce lly, we must try to solve the problem of how transport to Stonehenge was effected thousands of years ago. By common consent the archaeologists put forward the solution they always favour when they are at a loss. The gigantic blocks of stone were dragged from the Presce lly Mountains on sledges to a river where they were loaded on to ships from rafts. Professor Atkinson of the Archaeological Department of Cardiff University says that the bluestones were transf erred to boats which consi sted of several dugout 435"},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"tree-trunk canoes laid next to each other and which could carry the stones on a communal deck.2 An experiment was carried out in 1954. Three canoes built of elm boarding were fixed together by four trans verse bearers and floated on the River A von. A replica of a bluestone in reinforced concrete was lowered on to the vessel. Four public schoolboys punted the cargo upstream. In a second experiment, another team of 14 schoolboys dragged the block up a slope on a sledg e riding on roughly fashion ed rollers. Puzzle solved . Puzzle solved? Yes, if we attribute to the Stone Age men resources they did not have. Even the second phase of construction around 2100 BC still took place towards the end of the Stone Age. So scholars have frivolously or falsely assumed the availability of appli ances and workshops that did not exist. For example, shipyards to build models for the specific task, ropewalks to make the ropes for the heavy loads, cranes, even of the sim­ plest type, for loading, and last but not least a transport organisation with a staff of experts such as cargo foremen and skilled dockers. Altogether a couple of assumptions too many. If anyone objects that the islanders had already left the Stone Age around 2100 BC, I must explain one thing. It has been proved that the bluestones were present befo re the second building phase, i.e. before the erection of the sand­ stone precinct! Then the only conclusion left is that the men of the Late Stone Age had a lot more technical know-how than scholars allow them. This contradiction has not escaped Professor Atkinson's notice, for he admits, 'We shall never know exactly how the stones were transport ed'.2 That is an hono urable academic admission. Thank you. On 26 October 1963 the scientific periodical Nature pub­ lished an article by the astronomer Gerald Hawkins of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Laboratory, Massachusetts. Hawkins wrote that Stonehenge must definitely have been an astronomical observation station-24 horizon markers and sighting possibilities indicated astronomical connections. Hawkins proved these claims in his book Stonehenge Decod edJ• Hawkins wanted to know whether the 56 Aubr ey Holes in 4 3 6"},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"a straight line were connected with each other and the Heel Stone, but also with the bluestones and the trilithons. He did what is the practice nowadays when many different possibili­ ties exist. He fed 7140 possible connecting lines into a com­ puter and programmed it to work out whether specific sight­ ing lines were more frequently in connection with stars than the chance expectancy. The facts are stagg ering! The whole of Stonehenge proved to be one great observatory, a complex which was capable of predicting a chain of astronom ical data. Thus the Stone Age astronomers knew that the moon oscillat ed between a nor­ thernmost and a southernmost point in exactly 18.61 years. From the centre of the ci rcle they could observe sunrise over the Heel Stone at the summer solstice. Not only could they predict eclipses of the sun and the moon, but also sunrise on the day of the winter solstice and moonrise at the summer and winter solstices. Such a revolutionary claim has, of course, been disputed. Professor Atkinson, the 'Pope' of Stonehenge arch­ aeologists, made fun of 'Moonshine about Stonehenge' in the periodical Antiquily .4 His world picture had collapsed! So how could Stone Age men have built such accurate complicated know-how into 'their' Stonehenge? Hawkins and Atkinson climbed into the ring, but there was no outright winner; thoy sparred cautiously \"and came to a compromise. And when Sir Fred Hoyle had intervened with the elegant pen he wields as an SF author, to write 'Speculations on Stoneheng e',S it was agreed, after the correction of some minor computer data, that Stonehenge was a Stone Age ob­ servatory which provided extraordinary astronomical data. Professor Alexander Thorn also used a computer in his investigation of hundreds of stone complexes in France and England . He fed masses of circles and lines marked by mega­ liths into the ob jective electronic brain and asked it for ref er­ ence points in the starry sky. The results left no room for doubt. More than 600 of the monuments examined had definite astronomical coordinates! The stones spoke and their messag e was that their master builders not only aligned their sights on sun and moon, but also observed the paths of many fixed stars, such as Capella, Castor, Pollux, Vega, Antares, Altair and Deneb.6 437"},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"It was Professor Thorn, too, who discovered the unit of measur e which was universally used by the builders of such complexes. Thorn called it the Megalithic Yard. It measures 82.9 cm. Felix R. Paturi drew this conclusion: 7 The almost incredible identicality of the measure of length in Scotland, Wales, West Prussia and Brittany, with oc­ casional deviations of a few milimetr es, lead to a very interesting conclusion. Four thousand years ago there must be something like a central 'Bureau of Weights and Measur es' somewher e in Europe that supplied standard wooden measuring rods to different parts of the continent. For if every community had received the rods from a neighbouring village, instead of the central office, errors in length would certainly have been much greater. The geologist and mineralogist Vladimir Ivanovich A vinski, USSR, had a fantastic tale to tell. In an interview with the news agency Tass 8 he explai ned that he and his team had identifi ed a pentagr am in the geometry of the five Stoneh enge trilithons, the 30 stones in the circle and the 56 Aubrey Holes from which the magnitude of the five planets nearest the earth could be read off. Avinski asserted that the order of magnitude of Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn did not differ from that known today by more than 1 per cent. What about that! Naturally we ask ourselves how Stone Age men made such calculations without the aid of modern telescopes. Astronomy is one of the oldest branches of science; archaeo- astronomy is one of the youngest. It has only existed for a few years. It is an interdisciplinary science, combining the techniques and experiences of modem archaeology with the numerical certainty of practical astronomy. A few dozen experts are already engaged on it,9 starting from scratch, but they already include celebrated names such as Gerald Hawkins, Alexander Thorn, Anthony Aveni, the physicist John A. Eddy and the initiator Edwin C. Krupp, Director of the Griffith Observatory, Los Angeles. I like this recent branch of science. It seems to me to prove that authors like myself who cleared the ground for imagina­ tive realism were not so far off the mark. Can it be that we 43 8"},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"were responsible for bringing archaeologists and astronomers round a single table? My affection for archaeo-as tronomy is unchanged even when its representatives are obviously unfriendly to us. Given any outlook on everything human, I even understand that they must ' keep Immanuel Velikovski, Daniken and others at a distan ce, so as not to lower their reputation in the circle of academic demigods and infallible scholars, for in their eyes we are only vision aries and cranks. Nevertheless the archaeo­ astronomers themselves must stake out their claims with speculations and theories, like us, and seek proof of their assumptions, like us. If you venture to off er the public something new, you must not be squeamish. You must accept attacks, even if they hurt. But attacks should be fair and based on facts. Dr Edwin C. Krupp has said I have cheated with my infonnation. Dr Krupp says I claim that the tracks on the plains of Nazea were laid out by extraterres trials. Although Dr Krupp uses quotes, my readers know that I never offered the explanation imputed to me. I merely recommend ed it as an intelligen t assump­ tion. It does not make a good impression for a new science to cheat. It is certa inly not in the old academic tradi tion. It would be interesting to discover from archaeological finds, in so far as they allow us to suspect a connection with astronomy, how our early forefathers acqui red their astounding knowledge of the finnament. To reach that goal a young science should be more courag eous. It can and should include outsiders' ideas in research. It can march for­ ward without blinkers through the cramping legacy of pro­ fe ssorial ballast. It does not. So I am astonis hed by the pro­ gramme of archaeo-astronomy which leaves no room for the possibility of an extraterrestrial visit. It would only be com­ mons ense to bear these ideas in mind so that the facts do not come as a shock one day. Perhaps Edwin C. Krupp would not then write such incomprehensible sentences as: 'Astonishingly enough, advanced astronomical knowledg e is hidden in the first plan? He is puzzling about Stonehenge, but he cannot get over his astonishment. Stonehenge is like a second home to Professor Alexander Thorn and his son Alexander, and they keep an open mind when discussing it. 439"},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"I t is hard to imagine how the master builders of the mega­ lithic designed and constr ucted their monuments without these [astronomical] aids and yet that was exactly what happened ... The megalithic builders experimented with geometry and tabulat ed rules of measu r ement. We do not know what relation these concep tions had to their other institutions but fo r some reason or other the mathematical principles they investigated were important enough for them to be applied to the stone. OK. To me Stonehenge is an absolutely classic example of the need to take a visit by extraterrestrials into considera­ tion. Who are they, where are they, the beings who thought out the buildings at Stonehenge and Rollright in advance? They are all traced back to the sacrosanct theory of evolution. In other words the builders of the megalithic complexes had predecessors who, generation by gener ation, collected, in­ creased and handed on small portions of know ledge. So where are these climbing monkeys on the ladder of wisdom? They do not exist. The megalithic architects had all the necessary mathematical and astronomical basic knowledge at their fingertips, and even had a unit of length. From the start and without further-education classes they knew all about types of material, since they brought special stone for special purposes from a distant site. Because it had special prop­ erties? The pseudo-scientific fairy tale hour can now begin! I read 10 that around 2800 BC the northern half of Europe was drier and wanner than · today and that large tracts of England were covered with dense forests in, which herds of cattle grazed, and that the scanty population was the reason for the considerable wealth of the stockbreeders. This restricted state of trade and husbandry continued. It is assumed that the population density in 2500 BC was two per­ sons per squar e kilometre. There were no villages or small towns. So where was the demand for meat when there were no buyers at the market? Take it easy. The fairy tale hour about political economy has a point. The stock breeders' wealth gave them a lot of leisure and they used it to produce creative ideas about the 440"},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"struggle fo r existence. 'We can ascribe the idea of Stoneh enge to these stock fa rmers simply because their life was monoto­ nous and primitiv e.' Idleness is the beginning of all wisdom! If we actually fo llow the culture of the stock breeders, it is not revealed in its materials, but in its great fe ats of memory. Rabbits out of a top-hat -memory m u st appear. Obviously, for the Stone Age men could not read or write. Ston ehenge-ma gicians of the world unite!-the product of a brand-new culture, the so­ called memory cultur e. Good heavens! Stone Age geniuses! Stock breeders and. farmers tilled their fields with sharpened stones or antlers. Naturally a king ruled over them and their fa milies and alone or with the help of his wise priests con­ trolled everything. Then one fine day he ordered a start o n the incredibly productive work of covering the British Isles with stone circles a la Stonehenge. Why? For some reason or other. One of the most stupid reasons is that the priests asked for the complexes so that they could at last predict the seasons, calculat e neap-tides and spring-tides and foretell eclipses of the sun and moon. In other words, the priests were demanding a calendar! The result being that gigantic stones had to be set up, in the ab­ sence of writing, so as to reveal what everybody could observe without any trouble: the daily rise and fa ll of the tide, spring­ tides occurring at two-weekly intervals, the rising of the sun on the days of the summer and winter solstices. Stone Age men, being closer to nature than we are today, could follow all that from their huts or caves. They needed these gigantic complexes which took centuries to build to determine such recurrent events? Sheer nonsense. In 1979 the highly regarded American periodical Science 11 carried an article about a simple calendar, thousands of years old, which the Indians invented in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico. The Indians noticed that the sun's rays described a recur­ ring curve through a crack in the rock during the cours e of the year. They marked this by scratching a spiral at the point where the light rays reached the highest point. If the light rays traversed the 40 cm high spiral in exactly 18 minu tes, it was the summer solstice. From a nearby crack in the rock another ray of light cut a smaller 13 cm spiral. That meant 441"},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"the onset of autumn or spring. If both strips of light formed a tangent to left and right of the big spiral, it was the winter solstice. It was as simple as that. This article prov ed that monumental buildings for calendar purposes were unne cessary even for simple societies. Yet the Stonehenge architects were by no means primitive, as their legacy shows. Stones were not shoved about fo r centuries just to make the priests a present of a massive unwieldy calendar. Even Stone Age men were endowed with reason . In all ages one really important reason has inspir ed men to impressive extraordinary achievement-r eligion. So we should ask in which gods' honour monstrous buildings were erected in the Neolithic period, and we should check whether certain localities seem to be predestined for the purpose and why heavy stones and not light wood were used. Why were certain types of stone preferred-at Stonehenge dolerite and rhyolite. A scientific by-product points the way to a trail that is still warm . Ancient traditions tell the story of the magician and pro­ phet Merlin. In the year AD 573 he is supposed to have been wounded in battle, to have fled to the forests of northern Scotland and lived there among the wild beasts for half a century. It is said that he acquir ed the gift of proph ecy during this compulsory seclusion in the bosom of nature. 12 Merlin the magician emerges as counsellor to the fabulous King Arthur, who is recorded in legends from the sixth cen­ tury. There is no definite information about him but the Arthurian legend persisted and acquir ed literary fame, from the king's birth when Merlin protected him to the Round Table at which Merlin sat as adviser. The court of King Arthur has been celebrated as the model of knighthood, from Wolfram von Eschenbach 's Parzival to the musical Camelo t, in which Richard Burton starred on Broadway. King Arthur is suppos ed to have held court with beautif ul ladies and noble knights at Castle Camelot in the county of Monmouth. Twelve ambitious knights with no distinction in rank could sit at the round table, at which wise Merlin gave advice. So the round table was invented for knightly heroes. It has salvag ed protocol in many a tricky diplomatic situation. Every power is at the head of a round table! 442"},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"If Merlin only appeared at the Round Table meetings, he would be uninteresting in connection with Stonehenge. But this multi -purpose magician also appears in a work by Geof frey of Monmouth, Bishop of St Asaph: Historia de Gestis Regnum Britanniae. It is not a historical work, but a historicising narrative in the style of Homer's and Virgil's epics.13 Geof frey introduces Merlin as the magician and steward of the British usurper King Vortigern . This fine monarch had 460 nobles treacherously murdered at a coun cil. When he himself was beheaded, his rightf ul heir King Aurelius Ambrosius wanted to erect a monument to the 460 murdered nobles. Magician Merlin gave this advice: If you want to grace the burial place of these men with a work that shall endure for ever, send for the Gia�ts' Dance that is in Killaraus, a mountain in Ireland. For a structure of stones is there that none of this age could erect unless he combi ned great skill and artistry. For the stones are big, nor is there stone anywher e of more virtue; and, so they be set up round this plot in a circle, even as they now be, they shall stand for ever ... For in these stones there is a mystery, and a healing virtue against many ailments. Giants of old did carry them from the farthest ends of Africa and did set them up in Ireland, when they lived there.14 The King took Merlin's advic e and sent a whole army to Ireland, but they had to give up trying to move the gigantic stones. According to Geoff rey of Mo nmouth, it was Merlin the magician who managed to transport the stones to Stonehenge by means of a spell. Whatever may be discovered about the legend, Merlin cannot have given his advice in the sixth centur y AD. Building at Stonehenge was demonstrably begun 2000 years earlier. The 'hard core' of the saga must be dated much further back. That is often the case. Since I have been delving into sagas, myths, legends and old popular tales, I am constantly finding that the substance of such traditions, i.e. the hard core, is often submerged by the embellishments and imaginative 44 3"},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"additions of later narrators. The hard core is history that has been experienced and endured . Later gener ations no longer understand it, they were not present at the event, they added to it or made omissions, but, because the central point of the traditional story was so astonishing, it surviv ed beneath its many accretions. The hard core of the Merlin legend says that an inexplic­ able force is at work in certain stones set up in certain places. The 'circle' of the royal Round Table, too, acquires more signi ficance than that of courtly etiquette. People communi­ cate well in a 'circl e'. What special quality do the megalithic stones possess? Are they merely dead matter? Can they be 'addr essed ', once they stand in a specific circle? Can the stones 'hear', and perhaps even 'answer'? If only one of these questions could be answered affir­ matively, how did the Late Stone Age man see the phenomenon of the stone circles? The British chemist, Dr G. V. Robins, who speciali sed in investigating stones, also asked himself some strange ques­ tions. He publis hed the first results of his researches into Rollright in the periodical Alpha.ls The Rollright stones can be reached from London on a pleasant half-day excusion. You take the M40 to Oxford, bypass the old university town and swing off north on the A34 to Chipping Norton. From there you continue on the M44. Four kilometres to the north in the direction of Adlestrop the stone monuments lie to the left and right of the road, on private ground. The owner of the land willingly opens the complex to visitors from all over the world. The Rollright complex has three parts. It consists of a per­ fect stone circle with a diameter of 31.6 m known as the King's Men . About 70 m distant from the circle there is a weathered upright menhir, a typical product of the Late Stone Age, called the King Stone. In spite of the teeth of time which have gnawed at it fo r millennia, it still stands upright, 2.60 m high and 1.44 m wide. To the east of the stone circle there is a group of standing menhirs, though some of them have fallen over. They are called the Whispering Knights. What can the saga tell us about the goal of our visit? 444"},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"The ancient Rollright stones are only a half-day excursion from London. One saga rumours it that the Rollright stones are a king and his soldiers who were turned to stone by a miracle and that there are graves in which the king and his men sleep until one day they awake to life again. The saga also says that on New Year's Eve the Whispering Knights march downhill to a spring to drink. Another tale relates that an attempt was once made to remove one of the large stones at night to fit it into the pier of a bridge that was being built. Many men and their horses mana ged to do this, but every morning it lay on the grass again. On repeated occasions it could not be kept in place, so that the bridge builders finally gave up and took the recal citrant stone back to its original site. Oddly enough only two horses and four men were needed for the return transport. 16 Equally nebulous stories circulate in our own day. For example, people who have touched the stones claim that they felt giddy. Road-menders talk about hallucinations, illusions of the senses in the waking state, which came over them at 445"},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"certain times of the day, when they were inside the stone circle. Sensitive people are even suppos ed to have suffered shocks. Altogether enough puzzling phenomena to make a scholar like Dr G. V. Robins investigate Rollright. Dr Robins and his team took as their starting point the fact that most of the stones are silicates, from the Latin silex (hard stone). They form about 95 per cent of the structure of the earth's crust. Their own structur e exhibits a three-dimen­ sional net of silicon-oxygen chains, atoms that are permeated with ions, such as natrium, kalium and aluminium. The analyst speaks of stones with fa ulty physical structures, because the geometrical relation between the various atoms in the stone is never the same. Under the electron microscope a fragment of stone gives the impression of a disparate crystal and atom lattice with many holes. The holes in the lattice act like a coarse filter. Where such holes are found, the filter catches other atoms, ions, simple molecules ... and electrons! Like men, animals, trees and all organic matter, stone has a small amount of radioactivity, which comes from the atmosphere, a constant quantity of the radioactive carbon isotope. This radioactivity in the stone is constantly disintegrating and causes continuous change in the atomic lattice. Holes origi­ nate, to be immediately filled with ions and electrons. The lattice releases the captur ed electrons as soon as energy is applied to the stone, say by radiation or great heat. This basic pattern by which 'captured' electrons remain in stone and materials like stone led to a new method of dating things, analysis by thermolumin escence. The material under in­ vestigation is heated, electrons are released, reduce their acti­ vity to a lower level and give off the difference in energy in visible light. The amount of light can be measur ed with the technically highly complicat ed photomultiplier 1 7 and from that we can find out when a potsherd, for example, was fired hundr eds of years ago. The method can be used on any kind of stone. Stone x or y or z is heated, the electrons leave it and give off light. The amount of light set free is in direct relation to the emission of radioactive rays and so to the stone's age, for the disintegra­ tion times of radioactive rays are known. In other words, the thermolumines cence method reduces 446"},{"pageNumber":491,"pageContent":"The 'Whispering Knig hts' can no longer leave their site. They have been railed in. released electrons to a new level of energy. But,· if the elec­ trons are to be measured at their original level, we make use of what is known as electron spin resonance. The transition between two states of energy is effected by microwaves. The stone is exposed to a magnetic field and once again we have a measurable electromagnetic radiation which varies accord­ ing to the amount of electrons and enables us to decide on the age of the stone. The earth has had a natural magnetic field since its exist­ enc e . Magnetic fields originate through veins of metal in the ground. Stones have been exposed to these weak forces for millennia. At all times, we are told, they have minute amounts of electrons captu red in the lattice and released again by long­ term radia tion. Making use of this knowledge Dr Robins took a decisive step fo rward . The transf ormation of electromagnetic energy into sound is a known physical effect. So Robins looked for ultrasonic 447"},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"waves near the Rollright stones. In 1978-9 he carried out measurements on the site at various times of the day and night with a perfectly normal ultrasound detector. The de­ tector's protected head prevented inter ference by chance waves in the micro-range. The scale was graduated from one to ten. First of all Robins ascertained the basic level of ultrasonic frequencies in the district near Rollright. The values oscillat ed between nought and one on the scale. Robins knew that stones radiate rather more strongly at sunrise than dring the day. At daybr eak there is a predomi­ nance of long-wave rays activating the electrons in the stone. Then came the first surprise! The Rollright stones did not begin to emit rays slowly and continuously at sunrise. Unexp ected pulsation began in the King Stone and the group of Whispering Knights half an hour before sunrise, but not in the precinct of the stone circle. The pulsating effect of the stone and the group reached an incredible seven on the scale, whereas the ultrasonic emis­ sion around the stone circle fe ll below the normal level for the c\\istrict . Two or three hours after sunrise the pulsation suddenly stopped. But, while the reading on the scale at the King Stone diminished, it increased in the stone circle. In the spring of 1979 the ultrasonic activity in the stone circle in­ creased stead ily and built up an electric field between the King Stone and the Whispering Knights that pulsated in synchron isation with the ultrasound. Now for the second surprise! When a member of the team e ntered the stone circle during the measuring, the pulsation stopped abruptly. Dr Robins states: During all visits at dawn strong pulsation around the menhir as well as on the road and the field between menhir and circle could be observed, yet it stopped as soon as anyone entered the stone circle. This change from intensive pulsations to very weak oscillations below the basic values was repe a ted during the whole period of observation and was confirmed by a number of observers. 1 S Today the King Stone still towers 2.60 m above the ground. A single menhir. it stands about 70 m away from the circle. 44 9"},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"Rollright -stone witn esses from antiquity. In his final report Robins confirms the hypothesis accord­ ing to which the stone circles are energy-ac tivating centres and states that Stone Age men who built the Rollright com­ plex consciously made use of the energy produced. That is a fantastic statement! It opens up dimensions which measurabl y oppose the theory of evolution. That doctrine will have it that all development, regardless of in which sphere, results from tiny steps, that every advance arrives via a sequence of stages and over thousands of genera tions. According to it nothing can simply and suddenly be 'there'. If Late Stone Age men-to think in terms of the dusty old dogma-produced complexes like those at Rollright, Stonehenge and elsewhere and are assumed to have been at a comparatively low stage of evolution, their predecessors must have been even more simple-minded.

The fact that their stones also communic ate with the stars does not solve the puzzle, it only makes it more uncanny ---especially in view of the world-wide distribution of such sites! As I am assured that the collaboration of extraterrestrials is out of the question, something must have snapped in the sick brain of a Stone Age dictator, making him force his countr ymen to install giant stones in playgrounds, and, since all dictators are imitated, other madmen emulat ed him and whipped their populations on to similar feats.

If this absurd 451"},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":"origin and development is accepted, the stone circle phenomenon would have remained confined to a com­ paratively small geographical area, a purely European stone plague. But that is not the case. Stone circles must have been an international fashion. They are found in India, Africa, Australia, Japan and the Pacific. Here are the addresses of the most important megalithic stone circles: 18 The stone circle of Brahmagiri lies to the south of the Narmada and Godavari Rivers in south India. The stone circle of Sillustani is located near Lake Titic aca in Peru. The stone circle of Msoura is in north Morocco. The stone circle of Nioro du Rip in the provi nce of Casamance lies in Senegal, south of the River Senegal. The biblical stone circle of Gilgal lies on the eastern city limits of Jericho. It was mentioned in the Bible. The prophet Joshua is supposed to have set up 12 stones in a circle in memory of the crossing of the Jordan. The stones are supposed to symbolise the twelve tribes of Israel. The stone circle of Ain es Zerka is in east Jordan. The stone circle of Ajun uns Rass is in the steppe plateau of the Nejd in Saudi Arabia. The geographical location of the Australian stone circle south- west of the Emu desert: latitude 28° 58' south, longitude 13r 00' east. There are several stone circles and stone wheels on the Japanese mainland and near Nonakado on the island of Hokkaido. Professor Marcel Hornet discovered the stone circle of Quebrada of Queneto 1 9 at sea level on the border between Peru and Ecuador. There is a stone circle on Naue, one of the Tong areva Islands. In the literature it is specifically pointed out that the stone circle was neither a grave nor a tribal sanctuary com­ parable to a marae.20 The stone circles of Portela de Mogos and Boa Fe lie 16 km to the west of Evora in Portugal. 18 For some reason or other the Late Stone Age men made building stone circles into a world-wide cult.

The stone circles all over the world do not all stem from the same period, but the builders were all simple journeymen who had not the faintest idea about radiation technique. It is said that stones have always been sacred to mankind . Correct. Certain stones were worshipped and still are today. Gravestones and memorial stones, for example. Jacob, one of the three patriarchs of Israel, even-so Moses tells us­ erected a memorial tablet to a dream experience: Jacob left Beer-sheba and went toward Haran. And he came to a certain (holy) place, and stayed there that night, because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones of the place, he put it under his head and lay down in the place to sleep. (Genesis 28.10 et seq.) We do not have to read anything into this passage. It says in black and white that Jacob came to a holy place and put one of the stones, which presumably had collapsed, under his head. In other words, it was a special stone from a conse­ crated site on which Jacob slumber ed and had this dream : And he dreamed that there was a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heave n; and behold, the angels of God were ascending and descend ing on it! And behold, the Lord stood above it and said ... 'and your descendants shall be like the dust of the earth and you shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south; and by you and your descendants shall all the families of the world bless themselve s'. (Genesis 28.12 et seq.) The next verse says: 'For I will not leave you until I have done that of which I have spoken to you.' What had the Lord promis ed? Simply that Jacob's de­ scendants would spread all over the earth and the Lord would not leave Jacob. Whatever generative power we attribute to him, Jacob could scarce ly have distributed sons, daughters 4 5 3"},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"and grandchi ldren over every continent in one lif�ime, so the Lord must have supported him actively, for the I l ord did not make his promise fot an indefinite future. He would not leave Jacob until his mission was accomplished. Jacob found the affair mysterious. He does not sense that he can speak to the Lord at 'this place': Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, 'Surely the Lord is in this place and I did not know it.' And he was afraid, and said: 'How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven .' So Jacob rose early in the morning, and he took the stone which he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on the top of it.' (Genesis 28.16 et seq.) The facts: On his march Jacob came to a place with holy stones. Jacob takes a stone and sleeps on it, without having any idea of the magic power of his 'pillow'. Jacob has a vivid dream. Angels are climbing up and down the ladder leading to heaven . The Lord makes Jacob a tremendous promise. Was all that a dream or a real event actually experienced? If it were only a dream, the Lord's promise would have been meaningless. Dreams are disconnected, stuff without substance. So what if it was not a dream? If the stone on which Jacob rested developed a picture of the heavenly ladder in his brain? Had the heat of his body released pulsations in the stone? Undoubtedly every stone in these holy places was a special stone with a special history. Did the stone have the property of strengthening currents in the brain? Was Jacob a par­ ticularly suitable medium? Could a privi leged being com­ municate with human brains through the stone? Do certain stones work like 'transmi tters' and receptive men as 'aerials', when they are coupled to other human brains? Those seem to be purely speculative quest ions. It remains to be proved that they are not, that they are more than wild ideas winging in the blue. 4 5 4"},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"Men did not get the idea of erecting stones and monuments spontaneously. They were often inspir ed by God (or gods). In the Book of Joshua, the Lord orders the erection of mem­ orial stones at a certain place: And the men of Israel did as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, according to the number of the tribes of the people of Israel ... and they carried them over with them to the place where they lodged, and laid them down there. And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan, in the place where the priests bearing the ark of the covenant had stood; and they are there to this day. These stones were not to be consider ed simply as memor­ ials. They were obviously intended to tell a story down the ages: And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God; and he took a great stone, and set it up there under the oak i n the sanctuary of the Lord. And Joshua said to all the people, 'Behold, this stone shall be a witness against us; for it has heard all the words of the Lord which he spoke to us; therefore it shall be a witness against you, lest you deal falsely with your God.' (Joshua 24, 26 et seq.) The stone had 'heard words'? Joshua makes it virtually an 'aural' witness. But what use is a dead stone as a dumb wit­ ness? Did Joshua know about this special ability to repeat the words it had heard at some time in the future? It is still to be shown whether we are on the track of something working like a tape. - In Asia Minor the goddess Cybele, the great earth mother, supplied her Greek countr ymen with proph ecies which she made with the help of a 'holy stone'. On the Syrian coast her collague Laodic aea compiled her news with the same assis­ tance.21 At Delphi Pythia worked through the omphalos in the middle of the temple, the semi-ovoid stone called the navel of the world, and made daily statements about past and future which she had learnt about through the stone. 455"},{"pageNumber":500,"pageContent":"Mohammed Ibn al-Chatib from Kufa tells us in his Book of Idols about ancient Arabic holy stones, miraculous stones, the most famous of which is set into the wall in the south­ east comer of the Kaaba in Mecca at a height of one and a half metres. This is the mystical religious centre of the Isla­ mic world, worshipp ed in an empty windowless room. Muhammad himself made the Kaaba the central point of his religion and the 'Black Stone' (Arabic: Hajar al-aswad) the goal of all Muslims' thoughts. All over the world 650 million Muslims daily prostrate themselves in prayer in the direction of this stone. Their prayers carry wishes and hopes over seas and mountains to the 'Black Stone', from which they expect some kind of return. At least once in a lifetime every Muslim must make a pilgrimage to Mecca and touch the stone, otherwise he will never share the bliss of paradise. For the faithful are 'recorded' by the stone when they touch it. No wonder then that millions of Muslims still touch and kiss the 'Black Stone' in its silver setting, as they have done fo r more than 1200 years. What is there about the 'Black Stone'? What can it do, what effects can it produ ce? What is the unique property which the prophet recognised in it? As legend claims that the 'Black Stone' fell from heaven, it was at once assumed that it was a meteorite, an aerolite or nickel body of extraterrestrial origin, which did not burn up completely on its passage through the atmosphere. That is a totally unproved assumption, for there has been no chemical analysis of the 'Black Stone'. The Mu­ hammadans do not allow non-b elievers into the Kaaba, so they certainly would not pennit an investigation of their sanctuary. Perhaps it really is an ordinary meteorite, for its uninterrupted power of attraction since Muhammad (57� 632 ) is inexplicable. Meteorites of all sizes fall daily on to the earth, including Arabic countries, yet no one has ever heard of them being sanctified. Perhaps it is a quite special stone which did not fa ll, but came from heaven. There is a very big difference between the two.

There it is, this miserable trick of dismissing 'heretics' cur­ sorily and frivolously. If we realistic dreamers are so medio­ cre, why does anyone at all accept us? Because we hurt with our persistent questions, because we are not prepared to swallow the illogicality of many current explanations, because we do not look on highly dubious dogmas as taboo, because we doubt them. I read with pleasure a newspaper column 'Science 100 years ago' and sometimes catch myself thinking presumptuously, 'Good grief! Was that the ultimate conclusion of scientific knowledge?' I at once curb myself and think, that was the latest state of know ledge at that ti me. Time corrects errors and replaces old results by new more correct conclusions, which in tum will be polished up and superseded in a couple of years. That is a nonnal and hono urable process. I have to marvel at the sublime self-sati sfaction of my critics. They possess the ultimate definitive know ledge about everything that really holds the world together. Their elitist arrogance, their naive state of mind is enviable. I share the aims of the curious who think ahead, who are not afraid of being able to prove tomorrow what is unthinkable today.

The construction of transport problems of the megalithic complexes are dismi ssed as solved in many erudite tomes. Such problems can be solved in many ways. What worries me about the explanations put forward is this: people always proceed from the possibilities conceivable today, as if they could go back in their imagination, scientific imagination, of course, to fonner times. But no one was actually there. What is put on the table as a solution is still only one of many other possibilities. Those who have thought themselves back into the past always ofTer the same set of aids: sledges, ropes, rollers and inclined planes of tightly packed sand or clay.

I have a high opinion of our scientists, but I cannot believe in them. They are human and hence subject to error, as you are, as I am, as we all are. Even when they happen to sit on the throne of eminence, that does not make them gods. I This question is meant to shock. What if men, thousands of years ago, could liquef y stone to a pulp and harden it again on the building site, just as we do with concrete today, delivering it from the factory in big tankers? Excuse me, omniscient ones, it is only a question. I wrote it down without thinking, for I can already see it, torn out of its context, being quot ed by my smart opponents! So I do not claim the megalith builders worked in this way. No, I think that stones weighing tons were dragged cen­ timetr e by centimetre over hundreds of kilometres by ropes attached to the necks of Late Stone Age men. If belief makes us blessed, the great beyond is teeming with incorporated archaeolog ists. We shall not meet there, for I doubt their often utopian assumptions. From early times holy stones seem to have been associated with the 'gods'; at least they are associated with the firmament for they, like the stone circles, were aligned on the stars. Were the heavens under perpetual observation because the 'gods' had promi sed to return? In terms of a religious cult that would be a sensible motive for the tremendous expenditure of work on erecting the stones. However, it does not explain the astronomical knowledge, the choice of sites or the special materia ls. Or does it? Nor does a religious cult explain the story of Genesis­ although the 'Lord' had a hand in it-according to which Jacob set up his stone pillow after use and pour ed oil over it. Why did he anoint the stone? He performed a sacred ritual which pertained to the priests. What had Jacob in mind, since he knew that the oil would evaporate and burn 'up in the heat of the sun? Was it his thanks to the stone that 'spoke' to him? Undoubtedly Jacob was in a trancelike state when he raised his head from the stone. Was that also true of Pythia when she brooded over the omphalos ? Did she owe her pro­ phecies to this stone 'Navel of the World'?

I am looking for indications that extraterrestrials influ­ enced Stone Age men. According to the way of looking at things so far, megalithic complexes show no proof of anything at all. Anyone who blissf ully believes this has only to read a single clever book about Stonehenge to know that ex­ traterrestrials are not needed to solve the mystery. Everything is known. On the other hand, if we think just a little further than the 'assured doctrine' then the extraterrestrials, in­ opportune yet helpful in tricky situations, hold an outstand­ ing positi on. There are countless traditions which tell of promises by the 'gods' to return in the distant future after their stay on earth .· Hope of this return has survived among mankind. No one has so far tried to find out if a mathematical key to the date of the return is hidden in megalithic structures. More than 600 of the complexes examined by Professor Thorn are laid out according to astron omical rules. So far only the 'gods' know why. There should be no doubt that hard stone was ideally suited as a deposit for news of the extraterrestria ls. It is plen­ tiful, it survives the millennia, it made possible monumental structures which constantly attract attention. So my hypo­ thesis is: Thousands of years ago 'gods' explained to the inhabitants of earth how to lay out stone circles, what material to use, in what arrangement and where the stones had to be erected, so that the inserted messages could be deciphered in days to come. The 'gods', who created us in their own image, placed traces of their intellig ence in the descendants of the new species genetically manipulat ed by them. They made a mis­ take.

No one should 'believe' that titanic courage goes unrewarded . Let us set out on a new road. Unfortunately I cannot help it if it is rather hard going.

The molecular geneticist and Nobel Prize winner Professor Werner Arber says: 1 The results of molecular genetics ... show us that spatially and temporally creation is infinite ... Moreover creation is at work here and now, ubiquitously and continuously, in the independent choic e of details during the accomplish­ ment of specific vital processes. 2.

Professor Max Thiirka uf, a physicist from the University of Bale, says: 3 Recently the natural sciences have been trying to reduce everything to physical and chemical processes. Never­ theless, paranormal phenomena are connected with what we call life or the spiritual world and that is superior to physical and chemical processes. 4. Prof essor Erwin ChargafT, the biochemist, saYS:4 A viscous avalanche of information pours into every gap in our consciousness. The mindless babble of idling mach­ inery drowns every thought ... Naturally there is always something more to do. As we know, small fleas have even smaller fleas, but how small can we chop up atoms and atomic nuclei? I have an uneasy feeling that if the Nobel Prize for Physics were abolished, no more elementary par­ ticles would be discovered. 5. The theoretical physicist Jean E. Charon says in his book The Mind of Matter: S Scientists are seldom prepa red to deal with 'metaphysical' questions, for the simple reason that the high priests of 'official' science forbid it. Now, as in the past, to occupy oneself with metaphysical questions is con sidered unscien­ tific. Personally I find this attitude scandalous. 6. Professor A. E.

If anyone sug­ gests that God, who is a logos or ideas of a personal kind, stands behind the coding of life, the scientist generally re­ jects the suggestion immediately and decisively because it is outside his research possibilities ... But what would we think of an astronomer who was unwilling to explain the orbits of the heavenly bodies with the help of gravitation, because he would not accept the idea of such a force on philosophical grounds? By its very nature we could not prod uce such a force or study it in a laboratory. Admittedly, we could put the effects of this force under the microscope, but not the nalure of the force itself . Consequently the whole snbject of gravitation is scien­ tifically intolerable. Let us now make an experiment in the darkened room of an ophthalmologist and direct an electron microscope at our eyes. It penetrates the cornea, the iris and the retina. We slip through the lens, which is attached to a fine mesh of fibres, and perceive the optic nerve which looks like a tree with many branches when magnified several thousand times. A fascinating world is revealed. Small crystals, which look like the stone debris of a bizarre landscape, are attached to the nerve fibres. Our microscope brings out molecular chains, hundreds of atoms linked 'to one another. While looking at an atom, it suddenly gleams brightly; we see a world in per­ petual motion, we see the atomic nucleus, around which even smaller particles rush at great speed s. They are protons, neu­ trons and electrons. Between atomic nucleus and particles a universe is revealed like that between the sun and the orbits of its planets, Let us catch an electron. If we couple it to a measuring appliance, which slows down its velocity as if in a slow­ motion film, we see that in one second our electron enlar ges by 1023 and then contracts. In other words it pulsates. The figure 1023 is a 10 with 23 noughts! This world of constant movement and diffuse radiation is the mysterious dimension of all matter. .

For in the last event, everything is energy, radiation and movement, as Albert Einstein postul­ ated 75 years ago. This unalterable eternal fact makes many scientists despair, but forces others to be modest. Supposing we reduced (almost) everything to its compon­ ent parts and molecules were turned into the s m aller unit of the atom. If we then studied its behaviour and that of the sub­ atomic particles in a gigantic acceler ator that splits atoms and releases radiation, we should still be faced with the same result in the end. Behind the smallest unit there would be a new order, a new law, which seems to obey instructions unkno wn to us given by the guiding force which all philosophers call 'mind'. The French mathematician and physicist Jean E. Charon proved that mind and matter are inextricably connected! Charon speaks the precise language of mathemati cs.7 Col­ leagues who have not yet made use of his work to form a revolutionary new conception will have to take notice of it. There is no way round it, for Charon's way a/so points back to prehistory, which leads to the 'gods', I am glad to say. Charon's proof means a significant change. Matt er is material, mass, the substanc e of all life, every­ thing that exists. Regardless of its consistency, matter can be reduced to atoms and elementary particles. All that is old hat. But where does matter come from? How does it, how did it, originate? How did everything begin? Those are the exciting questions. In the beginning there was nothing, the infinite void-black body radiation, as physicists call it. This radiation was in a waiting state from time immemorial, before any beginning so to speak. We may ask what existed befo re this state. but we shall find no answer. It may be imparted to us in a diffe rent dimen sion-after death. But that is a solution dependent on belief . As we are trained to think in terms of four limiting dimensions -length, bread th, height and time-the concept of infinit e time has no place. If we posit a creator before any beginning, the new, yet age-old, question crops up. Who created the creator? Presumably a physical perpetuu m mobile will never be found, but the question behind the question is a philosophical perpetuum mobil e. 464"},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"Mathematics and physics are counterpoints to philosophy. Physical calculations and observations show that the first pair of particles-cum-matter were an electron · and a positron. t Negatively and positively charged, the particles hardly needed any energy to unite as a pair, to form the first matter. The first electron pulsated, as it still does today, at the incredible rhythm of 1023 expansions and contractions per second, a movement that led to extremely high temperatures of some hundr ed million degrees. Once again the physicists called the electromagnetic radiations so released 'black body radiati on' . On the basis of known physical reciprocal action, the posi­ tron can link up with the neutron to form a proton -one of the two building blocks of the atomic nucleu s. Then the elec­ tron combines with the proton and produces a hydrogen atom. Seventy-five per cent of the matter in the universe is hydrog en. As there would have been no hydrogen atom without the electron, it follows that the electron existed before hydrogen. The slogan 'In the beginning was hydrogen' is wrong. In the beginning was the electron. It was present at the origin of the first pair of particles and it asserts its un­ changeable role during the penetration of all matter, includ­ ing mind. Jean E. Charon proved mathematically that the el�tron exhibits similar properties to a 'black hole'. We must go into that further, for we do not want to lose sight of the elec­ tron. What is a black hole? We must go a long way back . After the origin of the world, the so-called Big Bang, gas, carbon and cosmic dust swept through the universe. Particles met and whirled round in a kind of cloud until, owing to the constant rotation, they formed a ball which perpetually attracted more matter. The increa sing density caused intense friction among the particles. Treme ndous heat was engender ed and as a result a glowing red star. The young star increased in density still more and finally shone like a sun. Light atomic nuclei fu sed to form heavier ones. In the burning melting-pot helium grew out of • A negatively charged elementary particle. t An elementary particle with the same mass and charge as the electron, but posi­ tive. 465"},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"hydrogen, then carbon, oxygen and nitrogen. Finally in­ creasingly heavy elements were formed, including iron. During this smelting process energy was constantly produ ced and emitted, a pr ocess like that which has been taking place in the sun for milliards of years and during which, says the English astrophysicist John Taylor,8 'our sun pours out 4 million tons of its own mass every second, ten thousand times more than the amount of water that flows under Waterloo Bridge in the same time'. Even a sun cannot go on expending forces so lavishly for milliards of years without damage. As soon as the lighter elements are exhausted, nuclear f usion (the construction of heavier atomic nuclei from lighter ones) comes to an end, because there is nothing left to fuse. The star inflates, explodes and becomes a big, new star, a supernova. During the explosion its brightness increases ten-million-fold. Stellar matter is sprayed into space, but in the last phase of extinc­ tion the majority of it falls back on to the star. This com­ presses it; it becomes smaller and owing to its small mag­ nitude joins the group of white dwarfs. But such a white dwarf has a special characteristic. Its weight increases the speed of rotation around its own axis. In spite of the original mass preserved in the turbulence, its diameter shrinks to a few kilometr es and the white dwarf becomes a pulsar, so called because it is supposed to emit brief electromagnetic signals with each rotation. Whether it actually does or not is unimportant; it does rotate and lose energy, which gradu­ ally slows down the rotation around its own axis. The top stops spinning. The star is finished; it suffers a collapse. Its internal pres­ sure can no longer withstand the gravitation of space. It col­ lapses and not a ray of light is left to tell of its former exist­ ence. The astrophysicist Reinhard Breuer defines it as fol­ lows:9 A black hole is what we call a star that has become so extremely heavy by contraction that no particle, not even light, can pass its surface. The contraction of a star that leads to the birth of a black hole happens in a flash-in fractions of a second-in what is called a gravitational collapse. 466"},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"We owe our ability to ascertain the violent hour of birth of a black hole to the astronomer Kark Schwarzschild (1873- 1916), who, as Director of the Astrophysical Observatory at Potsdam, made important discoveries about the movement of fixed stars. The limit (event horizon) to which a star must be compressed and from which space\" closes around it is defined by the Schwarzschild radius. Thus Schwarzschild confirmed what Einstein had calculated and what astron­ omers and astrophysicists have observed on countless occasions since then. The black hole is a space inside space, rather like a bubble in water. Anything captur ed in the space of a black hole can never come out again. This sinister Moloch does not even allow light quanta to escape and is, theref ore, invisible. Its existence is only betrayed by the curvatur e of our space which approaches the space of the black hole in the shape of a fu nnel. In this alien world, the physical laws preva iling are totally different from those in our environment. Compared with the unfolding of time in our universe, time in a black hole runs in reverse. In a black hole space has a temporal nature and time a spatial nature. In our universe all processes unfold with increasing en­ tropy. Entropy is the measure of heat content that is no longer available for mechanical work when energy is transf ormed. This is based on the second law of thermodynamics and means that the 'order' in every closed system always reaches a state of equilibrium of total disorder, what is known as maximum entropy. In simpler terms, if we pour a can of cold water into a bath fu ll of hot water, the hot and cold water mix. We call this mixture a 'disor dered state'. In black hole space everything takes place the other way round-the processes unfold with decreasing entropy. The 'order' gets steadily higher. In a black hole time unfolds cyclically, which means that all states keep on beginning anew. All inf ormation returns to its starting point. As nothing ever leaves the 'treasury', no information is lost. 'Order' is timeless. In this cycle informa­ tion and order increase, like human experience which gains a little more information every day.

Jean E. Charon proved in addition that the electron behaves like a black hole, that it deforms the surrounding space in exactly the same way. Space curves and closes round the tiny electron like water round a bubble. The electron possesses all the properties of the black hole, plus one of its own. From its enclosed space it can connect with the enclosed spaces of other electrons. Is that a contradiction, seeing that I have described the black hole as permanently cut off from surrounding space? Black photons, light quanta with very short wavelengths and no mass, exchange their velocities with the black photons of other electrons. The fascinating and important thing from our point of view is that the processes in the electron continue with decreasi ng entropy, i.e. with increasing order. If electrons exchange black photons with each other-and it has been proved that they d<r-the state of information inside an electron increases stead ily. The resultant conclusion is tre­ mendous. The electron has been present since the creation of the universe. Whatever stages it may have gone through, it has not 'forgott en'; its information has increased all the time. The electron has always been a stable particle. If we look on it as a carrier of memory, it has experienced everything si n ce the very beginning. It permeated the universe and pene­ trated all kinds of matter. It is a component of all living beings, all plants, all stories and all brains. Its order increased. It amassed information and know ledge which it can exchange with particles of its own kind. In connection with his description of black holes, 10 Rudolf Kippenhahn (1926), Professor of Astronomy and Astro­ physics at Gottingen, wrote: 'Even the matt er from which our bodies are built up has certainly bubbled about in the interior of a star at least once .' We must understand and accept the full signifi cance of that. The matter of the electron is immortal. Since it forgets nothing, took part and still takes part in past and present, know ledge and experience are also immortal. The electron preserves all the message of joy experienced and suffering 4 68"},{"pageNumber":513,"pageContent":"undergone. It permeated (and permeates) the earth, every stone, every plant ... and each and every one of them are bearers of information. Bodies die and disintegrate; the elec­ tron lives on and hands on knowledge and information from the past to the future, as if in a relay race without beginning or end. Jean E. Charon asserts: S This means that all matter that took part in the building of a living or thinking structur e and during the relatively short lifetime of that structure possessed the qualities of its con­ sciousness cannot simply return to its original diffuse minimal psyche after the death of that structure. The in­ fo rmation and the 'consciousness' once acquired can never be lost. After the death of a complex organised structure no power in the world can ever effect a retrograde de­ velopment of the elementary particle's consciousness. Although in the past we have had no idea how to tackle many paranormal, parapsychological and metaphysical problems, now a cosmic system suddenly appears behind everything. Albert Einstein stipulated that his body should be cremated and his brain donated to research . In 1978 the shamef ul news appeared in the press that his legacy to science was preserved in formaldehyde in a glass jar kept in a cardboard box in an experimental biolog ical laboratory in Wichita, Kansas. At the time, when I read the terrible news, I thought automatic­ ally that a chance for humanity would be squandered once the cells died off. Now we know that the electrons of this superbrain whir through the universe, lodge in plants and stones and penetrate brains in which they resurrect the knowledge already stored there. Then electrons whose know­ ledge Einstein increased flash out and stimulate ideas in a new brain that its owner would not have had from his own experience. The sudden illumination of a lightning idea happens to many of us. Suddenly up comes an image or a situation which we say we have experienced, although our memory says, I was never in that place, I never took part in that event. This mystery, too, is explained with the discovery that the know- 46 9"},{"pageNumber":514,"pageContent":"ledge of the electron. is immort al. Electrons of the long since dead nest in our brains and unreel earlier memories. The incomprehensible is now an actual event. The confus­ ing, the mysterious, the inexplicable become intelligible. Time in the electron runs backwards, as it does in a black hole, therefore it can also annou nce events that lie in the fu ture. Clairvoyance, precognition and prophecy become explicable. Nearly all West Europeans have read the name of Gerard Croiset, the clairvoyant who died recen tly. Police investiga­ tors from various countries used his services when they had to find the trail of a kidnapped child or the corpse of a murder victim. Croiset's proportion of successes was im­ probably high. He was the medium for something he himself could not explain. He did not know what went on in his brain at such moments. The power of electrons explains the phenomenon. A kidnapped child thinks and emits electrons charged with memories into the environment. These tiny omniscient particles are everywhere; there are no fences or walls which they cannot penetrate. If the brain of a suitably receptive medium manag ed to 'tap' even one of these elec­ trons and allow it to penetrate his brain, it would find the trail that others sought in vain or know whether a victim was alive or dead. Others will be able to emulate Croiset in finding a hidden corpse. It may be that a brain that makes contact with the know­ ledge of the electrons needs a specific talent, but I suspect that the ability lurks in each one of us. What was science fiction material yesterday is explained now that the electron has been revealed as an information carrier. Then the question, 'Who are weT arises. To put it crudely, like all matter, we are the allotted vehicles and park­ ing places for the electron to collect and store information and experience, so that the timeless particle can hand them on from eternity to eternity. In the mid-fifties a similarly astounding discovery shook the world. Francis C. Crick and J. D. Watson succeeded in unravelling the secret of hered ity. Every body contains the genetic code, the building plan for the construction of the whole body.

The cause at work here is the mind behind matter, the consciousness in the electr on. While female egg cells and male sperm are ap­ proaching each other, electrons exchange information through their black photons in fractions of a second . They are seeking carriers suitable for evolution. Utopia? No longer. As Wernher von Braun said: 'In hind­ sight nothing looks so simple as a Utopia made into reality.' The astronomer and physicist Arthur Eddington (1882 - 1944), who initiated research into the internal structur e of stars, wrote that the matter of the world is the matter of the mind. A distinction is made between dead and living matter, a distinction which should not really be made. Living or dead, it consists of atoms, protons and electrons. Let us recall the investigations Dr Robins made into the stone circles at Rollright. The stones pulsated; an elec­ tromagnetic field was formed-the world of electrons! If anyone stood in the centre of the stone circle, the pulsation stopped. Were the electrons communicating with the person at the centre? Is it not conceivable in the light of recent research that a medium sensitised for the reception of the electron message could 'talk' to the stones? The stones oscillate, re­ lease electrons and transmit information -they compr ehend mankind, the whole of natur e and the vast universe. For the matter of the world is the matter of the mind. There are primaeval stone sanctuaries on nearly all the islands in Melanesia and Polynesia. These religious sites are called maraes. The maraes have no characteristic architectural style. Sometimes, as on the island of Raiatea, the marae is a large rectangle of massive monoliths, then at Arahurahu on Tahiti it is a terrace-style temple and an orderly arrangement of monoliths on the island of Tubuai in the South Pacific. Before Christian proselytising, the maraes were 'the official places of meeting between Polynesians and the realities of another world '. 1 1 The rites that were celebrated in the mart/es are not known, but the islanders told the first European visi­ tors that they were very tapu, very holy places. Tapu means f 47 1"},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"'the strongly marked' as opposed to the normal. We have adopted our word 'taboo' from the Polynesian. What was taboo about the maraes? ,What was strongly marked? The South Sea islanders had a second concept that was sacred to them , mana, which means effective. Dictionaries say that mana is a word to describe a power or effect that is not physical and is in a certain sense supernatural. Mana is eff ective in men, or organic and inorganic nature, and is usually inherit ed. Mana can be concentrated in men, the divine king for example, or in objects. Mana also means the power that inspir es terror and awe. A marae was not only taboo, it also possessed consid erable mana. Wilhelm Ziehr wrote: 12 Mana can also manif est itself at certain places, such as spooky clefts in a clifT, dark places on the beach or in the jungle. Such an impersonal mana is then embodied in the spirits and demons that haunt these holy places. By hold­ ing secret cerem onies, for example by using the mana of a cave in a coral reef in the New Hebrides (Port Olry), one can make oneself invisible and invuln erable. One over­ hanging cliff conceals so much mana that anyone who stands under it can change his sex. Strangely shaped stones are set up at special religious sites, for they, too, contain mysterious powers. When highly regarded personalities died, such as a wise priest, an hon oured' chieftain or a brave hero, a mysterious mana possess ed them even in death. Their skeletons were more taboo than those of ordinary men. Their graves were especi ally taboo compared to other graves, because there was more mana in them. This strange spooky world which has had to be catal ogued as an esoteric mystery until now has a plausible explanation. The mana that filled the experienced chieftain or the wise priest consi sted of imperishable electrons. A priest had even more mana than other men and theref ore radiat ed more wisdom and knowledge.

May we not ask ourselves is this the reason why our feelings in a cemetery are different from those we have in a theatr e or a restaurant? Is that why we are overcome by memories of the past and ideas about the future in a mortuary? Does a heightened exchange of electrons take place? Did the primitive peoples still have immediate access to natur e? Did they still ' sense the vibrations of the whirling electrons? Were they still able to 'talk' to plants, animals and objects (fetishes!)? A Polynesian legend says that the god Maui came from the Tuamotu Islands to Raivavae to install a large morae. When it was finished, Maui took a stone from it to Tubuai , set up another morae and inserted his heavy present into the structure. The god must have been bitten by a craze for morae building, for immediately after finishing the one at Tubuai he again took a stone and flew to Rurutu, then to Rimatara and Rarotonga (the Cook Islands) and so on and so on. Everywhere he took with him a stone from the morae he had just completed. An absurd legend? Today we know why the god Maui acted as he did. With every stone, he implanted mana into the new structure. That is why Maui sought out certain special stones. For stones vary g reatly. Basalt has a different atomic structure from andesite, granite a different one from coral. It is true that ultimately everything terminates in the atomic world, the world of diffuse radiation and the electron, but the atomic lattices-we mentioned them in connection with our visit to Stoneheng e-d iffer from each other in the rough state. There are types of stone which, with less applied energy, exchange their electrons more rapidly than others which can only release their electrons with difficulty. Did the primitive peopl e s know this? Is that why our early forefathers brought a selection of special stones to special religious sites? Is that why bluestones brought from 400 km away had to be used at Stoneh enge? An article by Dr Hans Biedermann supports this assumpt ion.14 The archaeologists who specialise in the remains of Guatemala's prehistoric period have found several stone sculpt ures repres enting the heads or seated figures of ex- 47 3"},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"tremely obese men. These statues, which they call 'fat boys', are characterised by a property that had remained unnoti ced bef ore. Certain parts of their bodies are mag­ netic, a discovery which we owe to the geographer Vincent H. Malmstrom (Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA). In the case of the stone heads, which are to some extent reminiscent of the later sculptures by the Olmeks on the Gulf of Mexico, the concentration zone of natural mag­ netism are near the temples; in the figures of obese men crouching or sitting they are in the umbilical region. Stonemasons or sculptors must have been fa miliar with the phenomenon of magnetism around 2000 BC, for they sought out basalt blocks that clearly show ed natural mag­ netism in places as raw material for their work. That's it, I said. In magnetism electrostatic fields have a reciprocal action. Electrons are exchang ed. Modem in­ vestigators used modern measuring apparatus to show that primae val stones had a magnetic effect. What kind of ap­ paratus the scholars of 4000 years ago used to determine magnetic radiation at a certain point in a rock is a question I should like some omniscient being to answer, please! Research into a magnetic sense in human beings has just begu n.l! In June 1979, at Barnard Castle, 31 boys and girls were blindf olded, put into a bus and driven to an unknown des­ tination on a sunless day which precluded orientation. Longish objects, half of them containing bar magnets, the other half merely dummies of the same weight and appear­ ance, were attached to their heads. When they reached their destination, the children, still blindf olded, were asked to in­ dicate the direction in which they thought their starting point had been. The object of the experiment was to find out if the human capacity for orientation was influenced by magnetic fields. The result was astounding and created a sensation in England-as the New Sci entist reported in October 1980. For the test children who wore dummies on their heads could point out the direction easily, while those who wore magnets had no sense of direction. 4 7 4"},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"After further experiments, Robert E. Baker, of Manchester University, was firmly convi nced that human beings actually possess a magnetic sense which can be distu rbed by magnets. Although there is no doubt about the existence of a mag­ netic sense in various creatures, bees, doves, dolphins, birds of passage, etc., the biophysical mechanisms have so fa r remained a mystery to science. Last year, researchers at Princeton University in New Jersey, USA, demonstr ated the permanent presence of magnetic material in the dissected heads and necks of doves. The resear chers, writing in Science, said it was not clear whether the magnetic structures of living beings were actually used as detectors of the earth's magnetic field and their per­ ceptions then passed to the senses. 'At least six laboratories in different parts of the world are already engaged in in­ vestigating human magnet ism,' the report concludes. As soon as Jean E. Charon's epoch-making discovery is made use of in these researches, the circle closes. Magnetic fields are the operational territories of electrons. The original mind, the mind of God, knew that. He made his creatures and all matter receptive to the eternally active force of the electron. The mind behind the matter left nothing to chance during the milliards of years when the universe was coming into being-the creation was not a 'gam e'! As Albert Einstein said, 'God does not play dice.' Critics are particularly fond of dismissing my astronaut­ gods theory with the deadly remark that the distances from other inhabit ed planets alone made the cooperation of ex­ traterr estrials in the creation of life on our planet impossible. They say that spaceships could never reach the velocity close to the speed of light that alone would make the transporta­ tion of 'life' possible. Without repeating what I have already written about this attitude in my book Signs of the Gods, a spaceflight by a technically superior intell igence (though still conceivable) is no longer necessary, according to the latest scientific findings, for the importation of the extraterrestrials' know ledge and experience into our planet and their effective action during the 'creation' of the earth.

In 1918 he won the Nobel Prize for Physics fo r his quantum theory. Towards the end of his days Max Planck made this state­ ment: As a physicist, in other words as a man who throughout his life has served the most rational of sciences, namely the investigation of matter, I am surely free of the suspicion of being taken for a fanatic. So I say this to you after my research into the atom, there is no matter as such! All matter originates and exists only through a force which sets the atomic particles oscillating and holds them together to fonn the minute solar system of the atom.

Jonathan Swift (1667-1745) The American journalist Henry Gris, who speaks fluent Russian, interviewed the Soviet mathematician and astro­ physicist Professor Sergei Petrovich Bozhich . At the be­ ginning of August 1979 UPI (Unit ed Press International) sent the sensational conversation on the wire all round the world. I came across it on 20 August 1979 in the Rand Daily Mail when I happened to be staying in South Africa .1 I read the article and held my breath. 'There is no doubt in my mind that a crippled alien spaceship is orbiting our earth, a tomb from outer space with a dead crew aboard .' Had Professor Bozhich gone out of his mind? So when my clipping service sent me the Na tional Enquirer2 with the same interview, I wrote to friends on the editorial staff in Latana, Florida and asked for a transcript of the taped interview which they promptly sent me, translated into English.3 I re­ produce parts of it here word for word. Gris: Professor Bozhich, your colleagues �re very upset by the results of your resear ches. Will you tell us in the West something about them? Bozhich : I have definitive astronomical data concerning various important discoveries. Gris: And you're convin ced of them? Bozhich : Yes, I'm convinced. A crippled extraterrestrial spaceship from an alien solar system is orbiting our earth and it has been doing so since it fell into difficulties. It exploded. Two large and eight smaller parts of it are circ­ ling the earth. Our scien tists have been following the two large parts by telescope for years. We assume that your people in the West have done the same. I think that a Russo-Amer ican project should be started to bring to earth 477"},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"whatever remains of the alien spaceship and its inhabitants. It can be done and it must be done before the bits fa ll to earth and burn up in the atmosphere. Gris heard the Russian Professor Bozhich express the astounding belief that aliens from another galaxy might still be alive in one or other of the two pieces hurtling through space. He also considered the possibility that the alien re­ conn aissa nce crew, while observing our planet, could no longer manoeu vre their craft owing to the breakdown and died as the victims of their mission. All the indications seemed to Bozhich to be urging us to seek contact with the aliens (or at least the objects) in order to advance our technology by decades. On hearing this self-confident statement Gris made sure that the professor was really convi nced of what he was saying. He received the reply that there were no terrestrial objects in space before October 1957, whereas the fragm ents in question had been observed for much longer. The possibility that they might have been fragments of a meteor that exploded had been eliminated, because the speed at which they move would either have made them plummet into the earth's atmosphere and burn up or hurled them into outer space. Gris's attempt to get a simpler more plausible explanation from Professor Bozhich failed. No, he said, all the other possibilities have been checked out and I stick by my statem ent. Originally the alien fragments were taken for meteorites, but then scientists asked themselves over and over again, what is it? What is staying in orbit and not leaving it? Not until Russian satellites were diverted from their courses by the unidentifiable objects were the relevant data fed into a computer. Then, with the objectivity possessed by computers, it emitted the astonishing conclusion (which shook him and his colleagues) that the ten parts were all united at one point on 18 December 1955. Consequently 'something' must have exploded in our orbit on 18 December 1955. Once they had acquired this infonna­ tion, they kept silent for years, calculating and recalculating before they made the sensational news pUblic.

In my opinion there is absolutely no doubt that we are dealing with parts of an alien spaceship. We must not confuse these parts with meteors. And meteors don't have orbits! The geophysicist Professor Alexei Vasili evich Zolotov, well known for his investigation of the Tungusku meteorite which exploded at about 7.17 hours on 30 June 1908 over the Siberian taiga, confirmed, 'There Can be no doubt that we are dealing with the remains of what was once an alien spaceship. We have studied the case for years; now there is no time to lose!' Are we losing the first real proof of an extraterrestrial technology through negligence?

Why don't the Americans make a move to clear up the phenomenon? If there is anything in the most fantastic story of the century, why is it not constantly hitting the headlines in the press? Would not this research be worth a scientific 'summit' that might justif y that pretentiously overworked concept . I wanted to know what there was in the 'sensatio n'. Here is the story: In October 1969 the American scientific periodical devoted to astronomy, Icarus, published a nine-page article: 'Terrestrial Satellites: Some Direct and Indir ect Evidenc e':' The author was the astronomer John P. Bagby, who works at the research centre of the Hughes Aircraft Company in Culver City, Calif ornia. 47 9"},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":"For years Bagby has been observing the space around the earth, an important task, for as from ' the beginning of the sixties Russians and Americans were putting more and more satellites into orbit. The flight paths of these artificial heavenly bodies allow of no deviation from the paths calcu­ lated in advance. 'Wobbly' satellites must be prevented from colliding. That applies equally to the geostationary satellites which relay television programmes and telephone conversa­ tions round the globe and which, seen from the earth, appar­ ently always 'stand' at the same point on the horizon, al­ though they do move as wel l. No matter how accurately the orbits were calculated and although there were no technical problems, individual satellites did not stick to the preca lcul­ ated path. Something was diverting them, altering their courses and causing not a few of them to burn up prematurely in the earth's atmosphere. Russians and Americans covered every point in space above us with their precision radar. What was the cause of the course alterations? Even before the first Sputnik was sent up on 4 October 1957, it was known that natural 'micromondes' orbit the earth. Ten such natural satellites were registered: eight small and two larger fragmen ts. John P. Bagby examined these micromondes, publi shed tables, compiled over a lengthy period, with orbital data and fed them into a computer to ascertain whether the natural satellites were responsible for the course deviations of the artificial satellites . Bagby and his computer produced an amazing result. If the path of a heavenly body is known, as well as other physical influences such as solar winds, the earth's attraction and centrif ugal force, the deviations from its path that the satellite will make in the future can be calculat ed in advance. (Using similar calculations it was possible to predict in 1979 where and when the remains of Skylab would fall to earth.) Bagby explor ed every possibility. To avoid the artificial satellites having orbital collisions, he not only made the com­ puter calculate ahead, but also ran it backwards. Where did the natural micromondes come from? That was his query . And how much longer would they orbit the earth? Calculating the orbital data retrospectively show ed that all ten parts were united at one point on 18 December 1955. There was no doubt. There was an explosion in a terrestrial 480"},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"orbit on 18 December 1955. But in his Icarus article Bagby put forward the view that natural fragments were involved; there was no mention at all of an extraterrestrial spaceship. The Russians were the first to come up with that idea. Why? The Russians keep tabs on all interesting scientific publi­ cations in the West, which often publishes its findings in a rather casual way. To be sure Professor Bozhich said that he had followed the two larger pieces by telescope, but it was a fact that John P. Bagby was the first man to write about the phenom enon. East and West both ag � ee that there �re frag­ ments, but they disagree about what they are. The great powers like to pull the wool over each other's eyes, but there are facts which cannot be concealed, not even explosions deep undergr ound. If a technical heavenly body had been sent into orbit, there would have been even less chance of concealing it. That is what launched the specu lation that the ten obscure fragments might be artificial . The first launching of a terrestrial satellite took place on 4 October 1957, two years after the explosion of the mysterious object. After the publication of Bagby's article, the Russians also began to calculate and they came up with the same date for the explosion: 18 December 1955. What gave them at first sight the extraordinary idea that this disturbance of the peace in space was caused by parts of an alien spaceship? The wily Russians thought a little further than the Americ ans. They wanted to find out what path the original object had followed before the 18 December 1955. In order to do this, they first had to know the size of the separate parts, which would enable conclusions about the size of the object when it was whole. Radar and laser measurements gave the two larger fragments a diameter of some 27 m, whereas the eight smaller parts could only be estimated roughly. Our reliable friend the computer knew in a flash that before the 18 December 1955 the object must have been between 70 and 80 m in diameter. The Russians went still further. If the object consisted of meteoric iron it would have logically had a different weight from a hollow sphere.

Retrospective orbital calculations are always a bit dubious. To that extent, the 'unity of the object' is to be taken with a grain of salt. Measurements of the 'original' are easily arrived at.

Jesco von Puttkamer, a NASA engineer, answered simi­ larly, but in more detail.

You ask why such objects must have a natural origin. Becatlse logically that is the most obvious answer. We know that the solar system is full of them, so it is not unlikely that the earth has some, too. To date ex­ traterrestrial spaceships only exist in our imagination and it would be completely baseless and meaningless to scien­ tists to call these figments of the imagination real so long as there are simpler, more firmly based, more normal and more logical explanations. So the bubble of the 'extraterrestrial' spaceship bursts and honestly leaves nothing behind.

This must await a direct examination. However a natural origin is obviously much the most reasonable and in fact is entirely consist ent with the existing know ledge of the objects. Of particular impo rtance is that the roughly estimated semi-ma jor axis of the orbit places the objects just inside the Roche limit of the earth. This makes a consistent pictur e in which a natural object broke up due to the tidal forces when it passed within the Roche limit .· This is also consistent with the fact that the objects seem to have very similar orbits, suggesting that if a parent object broke apart, the mech­ anism of the break-up was very gentle, and not highly ex­ plosive. This fits a tidal break-up picture. I have no inf ormation about measurements of the objects, sizes, present whereabouts or any attempts to study them in detai l. I hope the above is helpful to you.

Given this weighing up of material benefits, science seems to me to be on the horns of a dilemma between the 'most obvious answer' and chance correct answers on an empirical basis. A fatal situation. Although I'm imaginative, I'm not a crank. I understand the dilemma, I am not pleading that every farfetched idea should be examined, but there is a broad field between the 'most obvious' answer and the speculative possible answer. Before the trace o f a possible answer is pursued , the probab­ ility of its being fruitful should thoroughly be checked, that does not cost money, only a little brain grease. Scholars should investigate most caref ully to check if the possible answer has a chance in comparison with the 'most obvious' answer. To put it in concr ete tenns, two divergent statements are in opposition to each other. In the West the most obvious answer is that the ten unidentified fragments are natural 'satellites'. The Russians say, 'We have carried out all kinds of research, we have calculated and recalculated ... they are parts of an alien spacesh ip.' It is not up to me to assess the quality of the standpoints of either side, but my nonnal common sense tells me that the scientific high-ups should get round the conference table! I 4 86"},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"am against losing a chance that may have incredible results. I am all for the Russians' suggestion to put at least one of the objects under the microscope before it burns up for ever in the earth's atmosphere. Millions of dollars were spent on collecting a few samples of stones from the moon that no one talks about any more. But very close to us, among 4500 registered artificial satellites, ten unidentified fragments are orbiting, with no one in the West giving a damn about them, because they have been explained by the 'most obvious answer' . I, too, incline to the view that the ten fragments are of natural origin, but they must have come from somewhere. And definitely not from the earth . The complete object which exploded on 18 December 1955 in the miraculously coinci­ dental view of both East and West had made a very long voyage. Does not its mere presence bring up the question of the existence of extraterrestrial life again? Could not mini­ bodies also be the bearers of alien distant forms of lif e. Did 'Bombs' from Space Bring Life to Earth? Die Welt. 11 January 19 80 In November 1980 a number of well-known academ icians met at the Univ ersity of Maryland, USA, to discuss the question of whether life on earth originat ed through 'seeding' from space .8 When I modestly put this possibi lity up for dis­ cussion in 1973, bucketfuls of scorn were poured on my thick head ;-now scientists are discussing it seriously. I'm delighted. Definite proof of extraterrestrial life is still lacking. Accord ing to Prof essor Hans Elsasser, the fact that the ques­ tion of the existence of cosmic forms of life has become a serious subject for research is connected not least with the view held by many scientists who think it crazy to assume that we are the only intelligent beings in the cosmos. Spec u lation about extraterrestrial life is not all that new. Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz (1821-94), phy­ sicist and physiologist, wrote, 'Who knows whether or not meteorites and comets rushing through the universe carry seeds to places where worlds have developed subsequently, that they give beings a future.'

The earth was hostile to life, like other heavenly bodies, which had been analysed by space probes-bare as the moon, ice­ bound like Jupiter, with a dusty crater landscape like Mars, with no atmosphere. But comets and asteroids hit the earth like 'bombs' and supplied the basis for every form of life with material rich in carbon. Sherwood Chang is convinced that the first life developed from these biological building blocks. The objection that space radiation and great heat would inevitably have destroyed the molecules is contradicted by Don E. Brownlee of Washington Univ ersity who is con­ vinced that the carbon-rich particles could withstand the long journey. With the help of their characteristic radio radiation Brownlee was able to find at least 50 chemical combinations as the . basic material for the origin of life-of the kind meteorites and comet tails bring with them. Professor Yeheskel Wolman of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem held the same view .9 At a congress in the summer Jerusalem Conference on the Origin of Life Did Adam Come from Outer Space? • Die Welt. 26 June 19 80 of 1980, more than 100 scientists discuss ed the question, 'Did Adam come from space?' Although they agreed on the de­ velopment from lower to higher forms of life, they disputed the question of how the step from the purely mineral abiotic world to the first low forms of life was taken. Professor Wolman: We know from chemical analyses that the basic building blocks of life are chemical combinations with monster molecules. Each of these molecules consists of many hundred thousand or even millions of atoms. We call this chemical substance polymer. As soon as we know how and when the first polymers originated, we shall be closer to the origin of life ... We suspect that the basic substance from which nature created the first polymers came from the cosmos, not from the surf ace of the earth.

The existence of vital building blocks is dis­ covered, but that does not bind us to admit that ex­ traterrestrial life exists. Bits of space junk are revolving almost next door to the earth and we don't even take the trouble to find out whether this extraterrestrial stone-let's forget the parts of a wreck of the (Russian) alien spaceship--­ contains micro-organisms which might at least supply irrevo­ cable proof of life in space! Don't these dear scholars realise that here is a tangible chance of turning theory into fact? We have the technical know-how to investigate the ten mysterious fragments. Why don't we do it? In view of the incomparably greater problem, does it really matter whether the parts are of natural or arti­ ficial origin? Let us go in search of the origin of the first form of life. It is worth any amount of effort. In this sense the previous researches of East and West are of great importance. It is simply a question of switching to a new target. That should not be too difficult. [f the UN (and its affiliat ed organisations) were not such an impotent rubberstamping set-up, it could summon members to a great communal effort: search for the first life in space! . We know that science is busily concerned with the question of how life reached our planet from the universe. When the idea dawned on us that we are not the only intelligent beings in the universe, many comic and speculative ideas were put forward. What would the gentlemen from other stars look like? [n the hope that the assumption of extraterrestrial life could be killed by ridicule, the 'little green men' hit the headlines. This kind of humour was of no avail, because more and more scholars were adopting the view that our civilisation was only one among millions or milliards of others. In the meantime the men who according to my conviction only recently were literally reach ing for the stars are back­ tracking ... for example the Soviet astrophysicist Y osif Samuilovich Shlovski. He once told me in his Instit ute at 491"},{"pageNumber":552,"pageContent":"Univ ersitetskiprospekt 13 in Moscow that be suspected pla­ nets with intelligent life within a radius of 100 light-years and he spoke of a cybernetically steered spaceship which could withstand a thousand-year journey undamaged. Today Shlovski describes the earth as a 'rare exception in the uni­ verse' and estimates the distance to the next civilisation at 10,000 light-years. The Russian's stateme nt10 that our earth and its life fonn a 'rare exception in the universe' is not so new. It is as rancid as the postulate put forward in 1974 by Jacques Monod in his book Chance and Necess ity. He claimed that we citizens of earth were the only intellig ences in the univer se-by chance! I otTer some reflections which in my opinion do not emerge in the public discussion. Scientists do not have to prove that life must have begun somehow, somewhere and at some time. We ourselves are proof of that. We are here! It is a law of all lif e that it spreads and mUltiplies. That happens -yes, but since when and why?-a round us every day and we contribute to it in a pleasurable way. That life perishes only to rise anew is an axiom that does not need proving. Unintelligent life, the lowest fonns of life, can only spread on its own planet, although owing to a physical event (earth­ quakes, volcanic eruptions, the destruction of a planet by the impact of a giant meteor) seeds of life, spores of the low unintelligent fonns of life may be hurled into space. Intelligent life has a tendency to spread. As soon as the technical prere quisites are available, it strives to leave its home planet to steer for new, distant destinations. Our own reconnaissances of the moon, Mars, Jupiter and Venus are examples of such beginnings. Intelligent life does not have to spread necessarily and ex­ clusively by manned spaceships. Intellig ent extraterrestrials can also send out 'life bombs', light capsules, which they fire out of their solar system with rockets. Such capsules can contain micro-organisms, cells with the genetic code of their own specie s. By this process intelligent inhabitants of other planets could 'seed' an infinite number of solar systems, as was assumed at the Maryland symposium in 1980. Many capsules reach no destination, roaming through the 4 9 2"},{"pageNumber":553,"pageContent":"cosmos for all eternity or burning up in a sun. This possibility of spreading life could already be an actual practice in our case. By the time the reader of this book holds it in his or her hand, the Jupiter probe launched in March 1972 will have already passed Saturn and left our solar system. If the probe had been equipped with a small container filled with micro· scopically small balls that were diffused by a radio signal, our 'life envoys', genes and micro-organisms, could be float· ing in all directions in the universe and-perhaps -reach a planet suitable for life, on which after millennia beings 'in our own image' would develop. According to this scenario life following the original pat· tern can develop in various solar systems. The scientific view is that this development on other planets is beyond our ken. Consequently the question, 'How great is the probability of the development of life on other planets?' is unanswerable. Once in the universe the life sent forth by us (or by other intelligent beings) continues to evolve according to the pri· maeval law. Life multiplies by snowballing. Ceasel essly. Irresistibly. Taking all the criteria into consideration, we have, in my opinion, a choice between three possibilities. First, life is infinitely complicated . Our existence was a unique piece of good luck-coincidence! (Monod.) Secondly, life can have originated at different times in dif· ferent places in different fonns. This possibility is so minimal that it can happen at the most every 10,000 light·years (Shlovski). Thirdly, life evolved once, somewhere, at some time, and spread by addition and mUltiplication. This assumption is assur ed by the evolutionary principle according to which all developed intelligent fonns of life are similar (Daniken). Possibilities one and two are not demonstrable at the pres· ent. Admittedly we exist, but we do not know for certain whether there are other intelligent living beings. Three is demonstrable. We exist and all intelligent life tends to spread and mUltiply. ·We-like natur e-p ractise this. Without the little green men!

Nevertheless, three men in the same clothes had been in his study in the flesh. Several eye-witnesses had followed their behaviour. Barely half an hour later the drama was over. The men in black withdrew as they had come without a word, as if the ground had swal­ lowed them up. 'What did the men want? What were they looking for?' 1 asked. 'I don't know,' said de Aguilar.

I doubt that Padre Le Paige's extraterrestrial relics will ever crop up again. On 5 July 1980 I stumbled across a three-column article with the headline: 'Did the Incas Know the Secret of Making Diamonds ?' The Inca, nowadays the plural 's\" is omitted, are old friends of mine and always good for a surprise. Why should they not have known about artificial diamonds, in addition to other inexplicable abilities? To my amazement I read: In the 500-year-old Inca temple of Cuca which lies in the inaccessible mountains north of Huanuco in Peru, a climbing expedition under the leadership of the South African ethnologist Dr 'Maath has made surprising finds on a site for sacrifices to the Sun God of this legendary South American people. After the Spaniard Lepico who reached the temple ruins of Cuca in 1925, Dr Maath from Cape Town became the second Inca scholar to penetrate to this 'holy masonry', as the correspondents of La Cronica, Lima, calls it. Apart from the fact that no one has yet worked out how the Inca transported giant blocks of a stone not fo und in this wild mountain region from the valleys to, a height of nearly 5000 m to build a temple for the Sun God-they worship the sun-it is incredible that diamonds described as 'synthetic stones' by some experts should be found under the floor of a place of sacrifice. According to the article the Inca ornamented their sac­ rificial chalices with valuable diamonds, stones cut from 502"},{"pageNumber":563,"pageContent":"natural finds that are priceless today. What was new was that the splendid sacrificial chalices were set in diamond­ ornamented bases, two examples of which Dr Maath dis­ cover ed; he removed seven stones to have them examined in Lima. I was not surpri sed to read that the diamond specia list and chemist Collins flew from America on hearing the news and travelled to Huanuco to meet the expedition. Later Collins said that he felt like an alchemist faced with the big­ gest discovery of his lif e. 'I have never seen such diamonds,' said Collins. 'During my long years as a specialist I have never hesitated so much in giving my judgement. I take them for half-diamonds, not synthetic stones, although they could be the latter. But it would be too incredible to claim that the Inca knew the secret of manuf acturing synthetic/real diamonds. In any case they are genuine carbon diamonds. But there are characteristics which contradict a natural origin.' Mr Collins did not want to elaborate, but Lima was await­ ing specialists who intended to put the previous finds under their special microscope s. Their report concluded in this optimistic and speculative vein: Perhaps decipherment of the hieroglyphs also found at the temple of Cuca above the tomb of the 'Prince of the Sun Stone' will solve the puzzle and throw light on the mystery. Cuzeca , the eleventh-dynasty ruler, was reputed to worship the diamond in which he saw a sacred gift from the Sun God. A report full of names, places and facts! The contradictory epithet of 'synth etic/real diamonds' had obviously been inser ted by a reporter. Diamonds are either 'synthetic' or 'real'. What irritated me, for I think I know Peru pretty well, I looked on as a gap in my education. Before then I had never heard of an Inca temple called Cuca. The mention of Cuzeca as the eleventh-dynasty ruler must have been a slip. The eleventh dynasty lasted from 1493 to 1525 and its ruler was called Huayna Capac. But that counted for little in comparison with the exciting news -diamonds, possibly manuf actured synthetically. Good heavens! I phoned my friend Rico Mercurio, who had proved him- 503"},{"pageNumber":564,"pageContent":"self on the journey to the Kiribatis, and dragged him away from his diamonds, which he was just sorting or dressing. 'What's the score on synthetic diamonds? Do they exist? How are they made, what do they cost?' I asked and was told: Antoine Laurent Lavoisier (1743-94), a member of the Academy of Sciences, was the founder of modern organic chemistry. In 1776 he proved that diamonds consist of carbon and are materially identical with the graphite frequently found in nature. This piece of knowledge stimulated researchers at the end of the nineteenth and during the first half of the twentieth centuries to patient and expensive attempts to manuf acture diamonds synthetically. They had no success. Not until 1954 did the Belt apparatus provide the technical requisites fo r manuf acturing synthetic diamonds under high pressure at great heat. It worked like this. A test-tube is let into a high­ pressure press that is under pressure of 35,000 atu at I 600 0c. Under these extreme conditions graphite turns into diamond, with the help of a catalyst of nickel or the chemical element tantalum, a very expensive metal. Rico explained that the process was complicated and expensive and that the dia­ monds so produced could not compete with real ones. That was just what I wanted to hear. The production of synthetic diamonds demanded a technical know-how which the Inca did not possess. If such stones were actually found in the temple of Cuca, we must posthumously ascribe an ultramodern technology to the Inca ... or assume that they were gifts from represen tatives of a highly developed tech­ nological civilisation. The article which so pleased me mention ed the newspaper La Cronica . An airmail letter to the editor was already on its way, promising payment in return for granting my request to send me the original report. In spite of the self-addressed envelope and the international reply coupons I enclosed there was no answer from Lima. I also ' asked the Gemmological Institute of Santa Monica near Los Angeles about the method of distinguishing natural stones from synthetic stones and imitations. Not a murmur. During my lengthy stay in Peru in the summer of 1980 I had a few days free when I meant to take a mini-holiday. 504"},{"pageNumber":565,"pageContent":"One morning in Lima I took a battered old taxi to the building housing La Cronica, a popular paper with a big cir­ culation, as I discovered . The sceptical friendship of the editor .;hanged to extreme politeness when instead of flowers I gave him a signed copy of my book According to the Evidence in Spanish. I told him about the report of the Cue a diamond find in a German paper, which said that a reporter from La Cronica had supplied the information. The editor knew nothing about it and summoned a colleague. The conversa­ tion revealed that no one knew anything about Cuca, not to mention synthetic diamonds up there in the mountains. 'That's impossible!' I interrupted. 'We roast that sort of fa t canard on April the first, not in the middle of the summer !' Through the cloud of smoke in which his thick cigar en­ veloped him, the editor put a colleague at my disposal and said, 'During the last few years since I have been in charge that item has not been in the paper. Take a look in the archives for as long as you want!' When I entered the long narrow room in the next-door building with shelves full of documents, files, annuals and boxes, my hope of finding anything in this classical South American disorder were dashed, but were pleasantly resto red with the support of three kindly archivists. Much like my own archives, there was a dual classific ation, by date and by captions. In addition to La Cronica all the Lima newspapers had been taken apart and filed in orderly fashion. I was faced with mountains which were assembled under the heading 'Archaeology '. With the assistance of the archi­ vists and the volunt eer we covered every report. There was nothing about Cuca. Did Cuca really exist? I began to wonder. It was not mentioned in the Peruvian lexicon, but given the thousands of Inca sites that did not necessarily mean anything. From the hotel I phoned all the archa eologists and eth­ nologists I knew in Peru, including men who have devoted their lives to the Inca. None of them knew the Inca temple of Cuca in the mountains of Huanuco, but they all consol ed and comforted me. There were so many Inca ruins in Peru that if they did not have something really out of the ordinary to offer they found no. place in the literature. 505"},{"pageNumber":566,"pageContent":"A good boy scout since my childhood, I picked up some maps. Accor ding to the German newspaper article the Cuca temple was suppos ed to lie at a height of 5000 m, i.e. in the eternal ice and snow. All right. Huanuco is 3000 m lower down, north-west of it rises the Cordillera Blanca, the white cordillera, with Huascaran, 6768 m high. Within a radius of 100 km from Huanuco there are some five-thousa nd-metre mountains on which the Cuca temple might be located . Aero Peru flies to the town of 50,000 inhabitants twice a week. The tourist guide, 20 which otherwise recommends a visit to every heap of stones, warns: 'The provincial capital on the upper Huall ago, prized for its pleasant climate, has no worthwhile sights to offer the foreign tourist.' That is an understatement. Huanuco is dreary, yet I stayed at the Hotel Turistas for three days. State hotels with this name are found in all the larger towns such as Ica, Nazca and Cuzco. In an old house near the hotel was a museum privately owned by a skinny nervous man with a goatee. The four rooms were crammed with all kinds of junk: stuffed animals, including a sheep with six feet, absurd archaeological figur­ ines, skull-bones, etc. The bearded gentleman, who travelled around the countryside buying his trinkets, had never heard of Cuca. The local Huanu co paper appears when needed, once a week if necessary. The editor and his wife had plenty of time to think seriously about my quest. No, they had no know­ ledge of Cuca, a temple or a diamond find. There were no archaeologists around, no excavations had been made for a long time. Was I on a wild goose chase? Toward evening I sat on a green bench in the marketp lace and stared dully at the colou rful crowd . Schoolgirls and schoolboys of all ages, with books and satchels under their arms, were running home. They were uniformly dressed, the girls in white blouses and dark -grey jackets, the boys in dark­ grey trousers and white shirts. Three young girls stopped in front of me. They asked: 'Where do you come fromT We were conversing. More schoolchildren came up, alert brown faces with hair as black as boot-polish. They asked, I answered. They asked me to sing the Swiss National Anthem. I promised I would if they would sing one of their folksongs 506"},{"pageNumber":567,"pageContent":"first. The song they spontaneously broke into is called EI Condo r Pasa. The song or rather my rather flat version of our national anthem attracted more curious children. For a moment I thought I had become a good missionary. I suddenly popped a question into the general discussion. 'Does any of you know the Inca temple in Cuca? It must lie somewhere here in the mountains ... ' The childr en looked at me blankly and whispered to each other. None of them had ever heard of Cuca. I asked them to ask their parents that evening and their teachers the next day. I would wait for them at the same time in the same place and if any one of them could tell me where Cuca was he or she would get ten American dollars. To make a pretence of work on the next day of my holi­ days, I drove to the ruins of Kotosh on the town limits of Huanuco. I knew from the relevant literatur e that Kotosh is consider ed to be a pre-Inca settlement, about whose buil­ ders absolutely nothing is known. The little site on a hill is not a place about which one can say anything much. The pre-Inca builders could not handle monoliths or dress great blocks. They had not yet been 'kissed awake' by technology. On this particular day I was the only visitor. Warned by the tourist guide, others did not even go to Huanuco, let alone to Kotosh. And they were right. My late afternoon rendezvous with the children gave me no information. Neither parents nor teachers had ever heard of Cuca. I was advised to visit other Inca temples, but I was only looking for Cuca. The sensational article in the serious German paper lacked any foundation. If it appear ed on 1 April, I would have laughed about it, as I did at the report in Sterne und Weltraum fo r April 1980,21 scientifically presented under the title 'Archaeology at La Silla' and supposedly coming from Hungarian sourc es.

But I had never been there long enough to get out into the country. My previous visits were confined to cities which were easily and comfortably reached by air. Perhaps I never would have gone into the countryside had not several reasons for doing so cropped up simultaneously. I heard about speculations that the tomb of Jesus was in India.

The letter from my Indian publisher was still unans wered when the post brought a letter from Tehr an. My correspondent of many years Dr Kamil Botosha wrote that he had just returned from a desert trip which had taken him 80 km into the west of Persia, to the town of Kermanshah. There he had seen hun­ dreds of cave and rock drawings which reminded him of ftying beings and astronaut-like figures such as I had pres­ ented in my books.· The caves are only known to the locals and are virgin territory, archaeologically speaking. Dr Botosha recommended me to make the journey in a cross­ country vehicle, unless I was keen on a long camel ride. I reftect ed.

Brooding over the maps I discovered a chain of archaeological points of burning interest to me that lay pre­ cisely on the stretch between Pakistan and the Iraqi border. I noted the following down: . Tepe Yahya lies in the Soghum valley in southern Iran. Six thousand years ago the city is supposed to have been a centre of the Elamite kingdom. It played its part in histor y from the third century BC. The oldest written tablets, older than those of the Sumerians, were found at Tepe Yahya. In 1971 a joint American -Iranian excavation team decided that the place was already a trading centre around 4000 BC. They had con­ vincing reasons. The written tablets proved to be rec eipts for the import and export of goods. Several hundred seals, as well as potsherds with mysterious motif s, were taken from the hill of ruins. There was no doubt that Tepe Yahya was worth a journey. The old Sassanid town of Ardashir Khurr a is located barely 100 km south of the present-day town of Shiraz in the plain of Firuzabad. I knew of this circular town with a diam­ eter of 2.16 km from descripti ons. Ardashir Papak, the buil­ der from the Sassanid house, had the city divided into four equal sectors by a road forming a. cross and considered it an image of the cosmos. In the centre stood a 30 m high tower without doors or steps. Archaeologists puzzle about the pur­ pose of this peculiar structure. This round edifice had always fascinated me, all the more because I know that the Parthians, forerunners of the Sassanids, knew and used electricity. I have already written about a Parthian electric battery which is in the Baghdad Museum .· The tomb of Kashmir, the ruins of Moh enjo Daro, the ancient city of Tepe Yahya, the Sassanid Ardashir Khurra, the caves of Kermanshah formed a line which could be covered in one journey. I had to go, but how? Far more luggage than I usually take was needed fo r the long journ ey conceived on a surprise basis. In India and Pakistan, road conditions, with a few pleasant exceptions in the big cities, are at least as bad as in South and Central American countries.

A cross-country vehicle is indispensable, one of the kind you are never able to rent. If I travelled from Switzerland in my own car, the round trip would take more than four months. Taking into !lccount local stops and possible political unrest I could count on half a year which had no place in my calendar. How could I reduce this period to a more reasonable one? After much de­ liberation, there was only one solution. I would have to buy a Range Rover, send it on ahead by ship or air, start driving from the landing place and return to Switzerland on four wheels following the line between my various destinations. Buying the Range Rover was a matter of a telephone call. Two weeks later it stood outside my front door, in its impos­ ing size and massiveness. It is faster than a jeep and has four­ wheel drive, and a differential gear. In addition it is roomy and comf ortable. I shut myself up in my den with the tech­ nical handbook. Soon I discovered many Achilles' heels when it came to mountain and desert journeys. What to do if the petrol pump failed? Would I find a spare pump in a country with an area of 3,046,000 sq km and more than 500 million inhabitants? Was the nonnal battery charge enough? Could the bearings be protected against fine desert sand? What about the spark coil, the oil filter, the V-belt, the inner tubes? A guardian angel made me do something that friends mocked me for. I took two of everything with me, not to mention a winch which could haul the expensive vehicle out of mud and slime if necessary. I do not know what we would have done without the winch. Perhaps I should have done my critics the favour of vanishing without a trace. In the century of tourism everyone knows that a passport is needed for travel abroad . It is not so well known that an international passport, a carnet de passage, must accompany a car. On payment of a considerable deposit, you are issued with this document. The deposit is supposed to prevent the car being flogged en route. In accordance with the inter­ national agreement of8 June 1961 the Chamber of Com merce of the home country issues a 'carnet for the temporary import of professional equipmen t'. I was yet to learn that interna­ tional agreements are not worth the paper they are written on.

Air France sent Mr Lakmiehr, a lanky Pakistani, to the hotel to help us with the customs. Why? We had a carnel de passa ges. At once he asked for Form A.

I infonned him that the car had not flown with me and my secretary, Willi Diinnen berger, but had arrived days before on a cargo flight. The Pakistani thought our omission was a bad business. He drove us to the airport customs. There he deposited a letter in my name which read roughly as follows: Most honour ed and venerable Mr Customs Inspector! I, Erich von Daniken, a Swiss subject with passport XY, arrived here last night and omitted to declar e my car im­ mediately on arrival. I sincerely regret this and beg you in your immeasurable generosity to overlook my fault and issue me with Fonn A. After three hours I got Fonn A and filled it in in 30 seconds. Mr Lakmiehr took us into an office in which Fonn A was stamped after a lengthy delay. My Pakistani signal led us to follow him into the next office. There the first stamp was validated by a second. The 'offices' are open sheds. Weary fans turn under the ceiling. There is never more than one chair which is always occupied by an official. Cats are busy hunting mice, and sometimes rats as well. Waving Fonn A like a proof of victory, Mr Lakmiehr made for a building at the other end of the airport. Why didn't we take a taxi? Our helper silently pointed to the distant house burning in the sun. I was fed up to the teeth. And I did not hide my feelings. The man behind the desk smiled!

'Carnels are not dis­ patched at the airport, only at road customs posts or in the port. Nonnally cars do not come by air!' If I had not already been perspiring like a shower from all pores, I would have broken out in sweat. An angry silent Mr Lakmiehr, Willi and I drove for one and a half hours through Karachi to the harbour and there enter ed the customs house, a gigantic hall with a hundr ed officials at a hundred desks. Below the ceiling 41 useless crippled fans-I had time to count them-were humming. No one there had ever heard of the internationally valid carnet de passages. With the courage born of desperation I shouted as loud as I could above the din: 'Is anyone here responsible for a carnet de passages?' The effect was tremen­ dous. Suddenly there was total silence. The gentlemen stopped their work and stared at me. Right at the back a bald official wearing glasses stood up. 'Are you responsib le?' I shouted. Apparently he was very frightened. I switched from anger to amiability, chatted him up, asked him to sit down again and said mildly that I had been chasing up my car for two whole days and was not going to put up with this circus any longer. Baldhe ad said, 'Your car will be outside the hotel in two hours!' You only have to pick out the right man. He handed Mr Lakmiehr three new fonns, told him to have the car inspected in the hangar, and then return with the fonns so that car could be released. Mr Lakmiehr assur ed me that all we needed now was an official to inspect the car, then we could go back to the har­ bour. Once again right across the city, then we stood in the same hut.

I said. 'Can you prove that the details in it are identical with those of the carT I clam bered on to the platf orm, with the carnet in my left hand. Out of his sight I shouted down to the inspector all the details from the carnet with a slight hesitation each time as if I was reading from the parts of the car. He gave a quick look at the car ab o ve him and scrawled his signature on the form. It was in the bag. I asked the hangar guard who did the work there.

'What's that?' I asked. New snags were looming up. Mr Lakmiehr said that the hangar was cut ofT from the street by a barrier. Soldiers guarded it and in order to drive out one needed a gate pass. As no one was prepared to issue me the blasted gate pass until noon, I said I was going to the hangar to get in the car and crash through the barrier. Mr Lakmiehr, who by now believed I was capable of it, beseeched me not to do it. I would be shot at and he would get into trouble with Air France who had seconded him to me. I went to the hangar. The Range Rover was still on the platf orm. I asked some workers to get it down and I would pay them well. After a lengthy conference three men began to undo the blue strap, taking their time. About 5 p.m. the car was on the ground again. Then I had an eye-opener. The petrol tank was empty, the batteries were not connected and the tyres were at half­ pressur e-our disastrous work at Orly!

That really upset the Pakistani. He was an important gentleman. I would have to wait until Monday. After forking out a goodly bundle of notes, I obtain ed the address of the almighty one. After a taxi ride of at least 30 km we stopped outside a villa with a lovely park. A fe male with a veil over her face said that the director was absent.

The director took the fo rm, scribbled on it with a green felt-tipped pen and handed to me without a word. Perhaps he did not speak at week ends. Mr Lakmiehr looked at the directorial signature as if it was the sign of a miracle. At last! Into the car and out of this bureaucratic hell. I reached the barrier. The soldier wanted to know what the contents of the car were. I told him in a tone that suggested I was worried about his future not to make any difficulties, because the car had been cleared by the very highest authority.

We made Lahore in west Pakistan our first destination, a city of 1.3 million inhabitants, and an important industrial and cultural centre with the famous Punjab University. To get to Hy derabad on the lower Indus, the map promised us a road 100 km long, which the Pakistanis enthused about as a super-highway. We got a taxi driver to guide us out of Karachi to the main road through bustling streets with b azaa rs and slum districts teeming with people. It turned out to be a badly asphalted country road.

The third reason for the presence of cows on all the streets was par­ ticula rly illuminating. They eat all refuse that is .in any way digestible. So they are simultaneously dustmen and hygiene inspectors! But why are they holy? Because Hinduism strictly forbids the slaughter of cows and the 300 million people Hindus in the Indian union watch caref ully over this religious law.

We were dried out by the heat at this time of year and enjoyed Srinagar in Kashmir, a region the travel guide calls the Asiatic Switzerl and.

In a flash the hothouse air of the Indus valley was blown away. Spicy clear mountain air made our spirits rise. We were in the foothills of the Himalayas . Srinagar! Factually and without exagger ation one could describe the town as the 'Venic e of Asia'. It is traversed by many canals teem ing with boats, gondolas and moor ed houseboats, especially on Lake Bal which borders the town to the east. Srinagar lies on latitude 34, the same as Gibraltar and Damascus. The average summer temperatur e is 30°C, in winter 3-4°C. Srinagar lies at the outlet of Lake Wular in the Kashmir valley. There is every justification for calling this valley 'heaven on earth'. Fonner rulers laid out parks of exception a l beauty, great extent and unusual floral richness, especially the garden of Shalimar, praised by poets, in which wooden bridges cross still pools. However delightf ul it looks, it is all on the surface. There is something wrong with this holiday paradise. Kashmir's Asiatic tradition cannot adapt to modern ways. Up here the streets are choked with the same filth (Sri nagar has half a million inhabitants) as down in the valleys. The most primitive hygiene is lacking. Although the drinking water is filtered, it is still a yellowish colour. Revolting. Here as elsewher e one senses how many expensive ship­ ments of foreign aid are wasted pointlessly. Medicines perish because of a shortage of ref rigerators. If there are any, they do not work, with few exceptions. Surrounded by dirt from birth, the natives are immune to the bacteria and viruses pre­ vailing here. They are dangerous to foreigners. Mortally dangerous.

The little pimp was disappoint ed when a rich foreigner­ all foreigners are rich-refused his otTer. The physical similarity between the Kashmiris and the Israelis is astonishing. They are of the same stature, have the same almond eyes and similar noses. The boys are circum­ cised here, too. As in ancient Israel the dead are buried in an east-west direction. Like the Israelis, the Kashmiri men wear a kipa, a little cap, on the back of their heads. As we drove through the valleys of Kashmir (without snow in the winter), we constantly felt that we were travelling thr o ugh a biblical lands cape and living among the biblical folk of the Old Testame nt. Kashmiri itself , the languag e of the 522"},{"pageNumber":583,"pageContent":"country, has much in common with Old Aramaic, the oldest branch of West Semitic, in other words the language that Jesus and his disciples spoke.

A legend finnly held by the Kashmiri people says that the Kashmir valley was really the promi sed land that Moses promised the children of Israel. Moreover they claim that the present-day Kashmiris are direct descendants of an Israeli tribe. Popular tradition here astonished me. The Kashmiris say that the Exodus-contrary to the biblical account-did not start from Egypt and wind through the Sinai Desert for 40 years to end up in Palestine. According to them, the Exodus started from Egypt and traversed the (present-day) countries of Jordan, Syria, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan to the highlands of Kashmir. We must take this version seriously, for if you look at the map, it makes more sense than the chaotic and aimless movement of masses in the deserts of the Near East. If we consider the Kashmiri tradition, many of the battles which the Israelites had to fight for 40 long years begin to make sense. What battles would they have been exposed to in march­ ing round the Sinai Desert? There were no enemy alien peoples there. On the long trek to Kashmir, on the other hand, the wandering Israelites would really have had to fight their way through against opposing forces. The land frontiers they reached were under the dominion of kings hostile to nomadic peoples who poured in with bag and baggage and a train of carts and cattle. The legend also states that Moses died in the Kashmiri 523"},{"pageNumber":584,"pageContent":"highlands. Traditions have it that the prophet was active there and that Solomon had his throne there, too. Following this legend the local mountain near Srinagar is still called Takht­ i-Suleiman, the Throne of Solomon, and 30 km south -west of Srinagar lies the tomb of Moses on Mount Booth, as every Kashmiri knows! This fact is also noted in the Bible: And the Lord said to him (Moses), 'This is the land of which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, I will give it to your descenda nts. I have let you see it with your eyes, but you shall not go over there.' So Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the Lord, and he buried him in the valley in the land of Moab opposite Beth-Peor; but no man knows the place of his burial to this day. What if ... Suppose that Moses had not led the Israelites to Palestine, but to the highlands of Kashmir. Tradition assures us that Moses acted on the orders of the Lord, the same Lord who destroyed the attacking Egyptians and preceded the Israelites in a pillar of cloud which glowed red at night. The Lord provided the Is raelites with manna from heaven on their long wanderings, so that men, women and children would not perish in the wilderness. There are many deserts to cross on the way from Egypt to Kashmir. Could the Lord have had an interest in guiding the Israelites to Kashmir ? I remembered the mutiny described by the antediluvian prophet Enoch-the rebellion of 200 'angels' against their 'Lord'. In Chapter 6 of his apocryphal (Greek for 'hidden scriptures') book the prophet Enoch writes: After the sons of men had mUltiplied, beautif ul and pleasing daughters were born to them in those days. But when the angels, the sons of heaven, saw them, they lusted after them and said to each other: 'We want to elect wives for our­ selves from among ,the daughters of men and beget chil­ dren .' But Semyasa, their chief , said to them: 'I fear that you will not carry out this deed, so that I alone will have to atone for a great sin.' Then did they all answer him and say: 'We shall all swear an oath and bind ourselves 524"},{"pageNumber":585,"pageContent":"mutually by curses not to give up this plan, but to fulfil the work we have intended .' Then they all swore together and bound themselves mutually by curses. In all they were 200, who came down on to the summit of Mount Hennon in Yared's days. And they called the mount Hennon be­ cause they had sworn on it and bound themselves mutually by curses. These are the names of their leaders: Semyasa, their chief , Urakib, Arameel, Akib eel, Tamiel, Ramuel, Danel, Ezeqee l, Saraquyal, Asael, Anners, Batraal, Anani, Zaqebe, Samsaveel, Sartael, Turel, Yomyael, Arasyal ... These and all the others with them took themselves wives, each of them chose one, and they began to go in to them and to defile themselves with them. They taught them channs, incantations and how to cut roots, and revealed healing plants to them. 1 Further on Enoch describes the conspi racy and even the functions the unusual 'angels' had to exercise. I did not need my imagination stimulated to recognise these 'angels' as something quite different. None of the qualities described by Enoch tallies with the benevolent and helpf ul attributes ascribed to biblical angels. Bibli cal angels did not beget chil­ dren, did not seduce the daughters of earth and did not bind each other mutually by 'curs es'. Enoch's angels were muti­ neers against the Lord. A considerable team of 200 members rebelled against their commander, wh(}-- as Enoch knew­ finally vanished into space in a spaceship and left the muti­ neers behind on the earth. What did the mutineers have at their disposal , how could they maintain their exist ence? They still had tools, a few technical apparatuses, perhaps a caterpillar track vehicle, a craft like a helicopter, but they ha d nothing to conquer interstellar space. Nevertheless, they had something left: their knowledge! The mutineers would have had some valid reasons for their rebel lion. Perhaps the commander was too strict with them. Perhaps they were fed up with the monoto­ nous everyday work on board. All these are purely specula­ tive assumptions. But now they were on a planet with men on it who were very like themselves. The mutineers decided to turn these men into servants and serfs who would enable them to lead a riotous life. 525"},{"pageNumber":586,"pageContent":"The mutineers did not stay together long. They split into groups, divided up the remaining appliances and decided to keep each other mutually infonned about their activities by radio. Then they went off to different poin�s of the compass. One group sailed over the ocean to South America, another to North America, a third to the Pacific and a fourth to Asia. Dividing up the earth caused them no problems. They behaved exactly like the mutin eers on the Bounty thousands of years later. Its crew took over the ship in the South Pacific in 1787 and made themselves independent in that ocean. Each one of them wanted to be a king. Some of them fulfilIed their dream, others were murdered by the islanders. And one of the groups described · by Enoch ftew over the highlands of Kashmir, perceived the indescribable beauty of the landscape and sensed the ideal climatic conditions. A good place to live! But alas, 3000 years ago or whenever it was-I do not trust the biblical dating -there were no men in the Kashmir valIey, no domestic servants. Being used to an aristocratic life, the gentlemen from another star could not imagine a day without servants, even in their worst nightmares. Rearing a domestic troop from a single pair o f humans would take too long, they felt, so they decided to guide a tribe from Egypt to the Kashmir valIey. That would be the land ftowing with milk and honey. No sooner said than done. The mutineers led the Israeli tes out of Egypt to the Indian highlands! So they used columns of smoke and fire to show the way by night. Without these signals the goal could not have been reached. Marches through deserts are worse than wrong turns in a maze. The 'gods' would have to help. Wherever it was necessary, they intervened in battles so that their future domestics would arrive at their destination unhanned and victorious. Those are just thoughts that came to me on the long jour­ ney. But I also thought about something else. In order to reach Kashmir the Pir Panjal mountains have to be crossed. At the lowest point at which they can be passed, they are still 2510 m high. Today this pass is pierced by the Banihal Tunnel at a height of 2180 m. The fact that the Kashmir valIey was uninhabited thousands of years ago can presumably be ascribed to this mountain barrier. If we spin the colou rful thread further, the Israelites now 526"},{"pageNumber":587,"pageContent":"had their own land which they could cultivate for themselves and their 'Lord'. Then as now the Israelites, now the Israelis, were and are an industrious obedient and intelligent people, obviously the reason why the mutineers brought this highly cultivated tribe into the country. With its help, temples, palaces and gardens soon came into being. The Kashmir valley became the promised land, a paradise. These admitt edly bold speCUlations have a snag. According to biblical exegeses King Solomon (c. 965-926) had a temple built in Jerusalem. Did King Solomon, like his predecessor David, not belong to the group which was pilot ed to the Kashmir valley? Did Solomon spend some time in Kashmir and some time in Palestine? No one can be in two places at once. Not even Solomon! The Kebra Nagast is the oldest Ethiopian traditional scrip­ ture. In Chapters 30, 52, 58, 59 and 94 it tells at length about a 'heavenly car' which King Solomon inherited from his forefathers and used zealously.· 'But the King ... and all those who obeyed his word, flew on the wagon without pain or suffering, and without sweat or exhaustion, and travelled in one day a distance which (usually) took three months to traver se.' 2 From Jerusalem to Sri nagar it is barely 4000 km as the crow flies. On foot this distance would take more than three months to cover. Given a day's march of 20 km, one could cover 600 km in a month and 1800 km in three months. And the land route is infinitely longer than the distance as the crow flies. But that is just the distance Solomon is supposed to have covered in one day in his flying machine, according to Kebra Nagas t. If the king had been in the air only 12 out of the 24 hours his craf t would have had a speed of 150 km per hour. If we \"\"\"ume that he flew only eight hours a day, his heavenly car would have had an average speed of 225 km per hour, not the speed of jet planes, but fa st enough to go back and forth between Jerusalem and Srinagar several times a month. Supposing King Solomon had made an interim landing about half way between Kashmir and Israel, there should presumably be indications of such a landing in present-day Iran. Heavenly air machines, not an everyday sight in those • The story of the heavenly vehicle is described in detail in Signs of the Gods. 527"},{"pageNumber":588,"pageContent":"days, could not have started and landed without being spotted. by the inhabitants. In fact the sugarloaf mountain Takht-i-Suleiman, Throne of Solomon, like the one near Srinagar, is located in north­ west Iran at a height of 2200 m. On the Iranian Throne of Solomon there was a Sassanid fire temple in which fire and water were worshi pped . Fire and water? They do not like each other. When they meet, steam arises. Was Solomon's flying machine driven by steam? Was the technique of the steam engine known, in the form in which it was first dis­ covered by the Frenchman Denis Papin (1647-1712 )? Did they worship fire and water because of this wonder? Oddly enough the neighbouring mountain is called Zendan-i­ Suleiman which means 'Prison of Solomon'. Perhaps the pilot went off course and made a fo rced landing there. Quite apart from any bold flights of imagination, the fact remains that there are two mountains called after Solomon one in Iran and one near Srinagar. There were temples con­ secrated to Solomon on both of them. The edifice in Iran no longer exists, but the temple near Srinagar is still in use, al­ though it has been rebuilt many times. Incidentally, my assumption explains why Solomon had to fe tch architects and master builders from Lebanon to build the temple at Jerusal em. His own people were working in the valley of Kashmir. It is obvious that these hypothes es, which will take Many of my readers' breath away, are conne cted with my extra­ terrestri als. It is not clear what they can have to do with Jesus who lived 1000 years later. Until I had hard facts to handle, I let my thoughts dwell on the matter. The sect of the Essenes on the Dead Sea, who were bound by the Mosaic law, knew that at least one Israelite tribe lived in distant Kashmir. 3 They knew old writings frf)m Solomon's reign and his Asiatic connec tions. Perhaps there was still contact in Jesus' day between the Essenes and their fe llow country­ men who had gone to Kashmir. So these are my assumptions about how and why Jesus might have come to Kashmir. Jesus was nailed to the cross at noon on a Friday. The Sabbath, the seventh day of the week, begins at midnight on Friday. It is the day of rest, of sanctification and spiritual renewal. The Roman occupying forces were intelligent 528"},{"pageNumber":589,"pageContent":"enough to respect this religious law. Consequently no one who was punish ed could continue to hang on the cross on the Sabba th. Contrary to general opinion the Roman punishment of crucifixion was not inevitably a death sen­ tence, but rather a barbarous form of torture which strong and healthy bodies, controlled by a stubborn will, could surviv e. The Bible tells us that a Roman legionary pierced Jesus in the side with a spear and that blood and water flowed from the wound. That means that Jesus was not dead. Joseph and Nicodemus, in the presence of some women, including the mother of Jesus, were allowed to take the Master down from the cross. The men allowed the Roman soldiers to go on thinking that the Lord was dead, covered the martyred body with cloths and treated the wounds with salves and herbs in a secret place, perhaps the monastery of the Essenes, who had some outstanding doctors. That is the only way in which the following biblical text becomes intelligible : 'Why do you seek the living among the dead?' , the question two men asked the women at the tomb (Luke 24.1). John the Evangelist does not mention the resurrection and the statements of Matthew, Mark and Luke are con­ tradictory. The biblical account relates that Jesus show ed himself to his disciples after being taken from the cross and that he even allow ed Doubting Thomas to touch the wounds in his hands and feet. The Romans heard the news that Jesus was alive and began to look for him. As a well-known figure Jesus dared not show himself in public, a difficult task, for all the territory around present-day Israel was occupied by the Romans-Egypt. to the south, Lebanon and Turkey in the north, and Europe to the west. There was only one suitable direction to flee in­ eastwards! Were the Essenes in action again with their fifth column? Did they advise Jesus to fly in the direction of Kashmir because they could assure him that he would meet fellow countrymen there? The Romans install ed Saul as a persecutor because they knew that as a trained officer he hunted the Christians down. Saul, the crafty fox, realised that Jesus would have to go via Damascus in an easterly direction to escape persecu tion. Outside Damascus Jesus made Saul blind. 'Saul, Saul, why doest thou persecute me?' (Acts 9.4.) In conversation Jesus 529"},{"pageNumber":590,"pageContent":"manag ed to convinc e the Romans that he was no longer dangerous to them and they could let him go on his way. After this encounter Saul changed his name to Paul. He turned into a missionary to the heathens, in other words he was the first non -believer won over to Christianity by Jesus hims elf. Now Paul preached the doctrine of Jesus by which all are equal before God, a politi cal programme of an explosive nature, because it was liable to misint erpretati on. Paul's mis­ sionary journeys were punctuated by revolts by slaves­ reason for the first post-Christian emperors to persecute the youthf ul Christian community in ,a bloodthirsty fashion. The Roman Saul/Paul was finally crucified head downwards, payment for his treason in the eyes of the Romans. Was Christ's mother Mary unable to stand the rigours of the journey? Did she die a few kilometres west of present-day Rawalpindi in Pakistan? In any case the chapel Mai Mari, 'Last Resting Place of Mother Mary', still exists there today. If we follow Indian traditions, Jesus continued on his way to Kashmir. He had escaped from his Roman persecu tors. He would certai nly have been given a friendly reception in Kashmir by the exiled community living according to the strict precepts of the Essenes. He would have married and died at a great age, venerated both by simple men and mighty rulers. These thoughts put together from my reading and various pointers, though they contained many question marks, kept me going until I could follow up visible track s. Professor Dr F. M. Hassnain, with whom I had exchanged several letters in which I had told him of my forthcoming visit, was waiting for me on the terrace of the Hotel Oberoi, a former mahara jah's palace. He is in government service and as Head of Archives not only looks after present-day state papers, but also documents from the past. I hoped that he would help to clarif y my daring conjectures. Now he sat next to me under a sunshade. All was peace around us. Our view of an Eden-like park and the waters of Srinagar spark­ ling in the sunlight formed the ideal background for a quiet convers ation. Only as the days went by was I to realise the respect fe lt for this amiable scholar by the highbrows of the city. Chance had led me to a really well-inf ormed man. When I began to talk about Jesus' possible sojourn in Kashmir and pointed out that the story of the exist�nce of 530"},{"pageNumber":591,"pageContent":"Jesus' tomb was not enough for genuine conviction, Professor Hassnain obviously felt my scepticism was asking too much. 'The chain of proof has no gaps in it. It can stand up before any court!' 'Thank you, Professor, I am anxious to hear it.' 'I assume,' lectured Hassnain, 'that you have noticed during your drive through our country how similar the population of Kashmir is to the inhabitants of histo rical Palestine. These similarities are not confined to appearance and language, or even to religious rituals. You can recognise the similarities in ancient temple buildings, which all look like miniatures of the temple in Jerusalem. You saw the Throne of Solomon mountain and the Garden of Solomon barely 15 km from here. The mountains mentio ned in Deuteronomy that you seek in vain in Palestine are here in Kashmir and, hono ured sir, the tomb of Moses is also here in our country. No, believe me, when Jesus made his way here, he wasn't looking for some vague destination, but the land of his fa thers!' 'How did Jesus know about this coun try?' Profes sor Hassnain looked at me and took a drink of iced tea with lemon. 'There are several possibilities. Perhaps he knew about it from ancient writings in the Essene monastery. If there were no written references, there were oral traditions, after all it was not long after the Exodus. And there is one underesti­ mated possibility. You know that Western Christian scholars cannot fill the gap in Jesus' life between the ages of 12 and 13. So we must ask whether Jesus had not been in our country from his boyho od.' As the professor was pleading for accuracy, I asked 'There is an enormous distance of 4000 km as the crow flies between Jerusalem and Srinagar. How. did Jesus cover it?' The professor grinned and answer ed after lighting one of his super-king-s ize cigarettes: 'My dear fellow, think of the Canadian settlers in our cen­ tury. They crossed from the east to the west coast-700 km­ without railways, airplanes or cars. On foot, with families and household in the simplest of covered wagons. Given a day's march of only 15 km the distance from Palestine to Kashmir could be covered in a year and in biblical times the 531"},{"pageNumber":593,"pageContent":"people were definitely much better walkers than we are today .' He argues well, this professor, I thought, but I persist ed. 'Is there anything tangible to measur e or phot ograph?' The question obviously startled Hassnain; he sat up stiffly in his chair. 'We have the tomb of Jesus, mentioned in documents for more than 1900 years. The inscription reads: \"Here lies the famous prophet Yuz-Asaf , called Yusu, prophet of the chil­ dren of Israel.\" I should tell you that Yuz-Asaf and Yusu are identical with the name of Jesus. They are the local trans­ literations. ' The next day Prof essor Hassnain took us to a narrow alley which is in perpetual gloom. It is called 'A Prophet Will Come'. Our goal is Rauzabal Khanyar, a building combining elements of church and mosque. Unauth orised as we were, we would not have been allowed to enter without Professor Hassnain. He is known and respected and anyone accom­ panying him profits by his authority. We all took our shoes ofT and said a prayer along with the custodian and his family. I admit that I fe lt uneasy . It was an uncanny thought that I might be close to the bones of the genuine Jesus. The room is rather dark. A cross with lighted candles rests on beams. In the centre stands a delicately carved shrine pro­ tected by a lattice of narrow strips of wood. Incense sticks glowed in a bowl on the floor. It is not only a place of pilgrimage for Christians, for Hindus and Moslems venerate the burial site, too. Although they look on Muhammad as the highest prophet of god, Jesus means much to them as an eloquent prophet and exemplary man. At one point, which could not be entered, I saw footprints in the stone floor. 'What is that?' I whispered. 'Those are Jesus' footprints,' said the custodian, mumbling a prayer, lowering his head and folding his hands across his chest as pilgrims to Christian holy places do. 'May I touch the stone?' I asked. Without interrupting his prayer, the guide nodded with monkish meekness. Measuring Rluzlbal KhlnYlr, thl piece of pilgrimage, lies in I gloomy alley. 533"},{"pageNumber":594,"pageContent":"with my outspread hand, I estimated the prints to be equal to a size 12 foot. I felt depressions and unevennesses in the prints. The marks of wounds? That is what they claim here. In a whisper I asked Prof essor Hassnain if I might be allowed to go into the tomb. My request would probably have been firmly refused, if Dr Aziz Kashmiri, author of the book Jesus in Kashmir, had not jo ined our group as agreed. He supported my request. The shrine was opened. I said a short prayer to please those who were watching me. I got my camera ready and went inside through a small lattic e door. Looking back on it I have to admit that I was annoyed for some inexplicable reason. At the time, I remember, I was forced to concentrate on complicated shots. The flashlight blazed. Sacrilege? I thought of the Jesus of my schooldays who, so we were taught, understood all kinds of human behaviour. I believe that he would also have understanding for my curiosity. I fished the compass from the breast pocket of my bush jacket. The stones of the tomb were aligned in a west-east direction. I took photos with various objectives. I kept busy because I was disappointed. Does this tomb, this stoneclad burial place, offer conclusions about what is hidden in it? Is every­ thing that is claimed about it simply a chimer a? These stone slabs must be raised, the real grave must be opened. We would not have genuine proof until bones with wound marks in hands and feet were revealed. Perhaps the funerary adjuncts would also provide information. One might also imagine that, in the case of such a famous figure as Jesus, a scroll with details of his life might have been laid in his last resting place. The exact time of his death could be dated from the smallest piece of bone. • Professor, why is the grave not investigated so that assumptions would become facts?' Hassnain explained that he had been trying to achieve this for years, but without succe ss. The highest circles were afraid of offending the religious suscept ibilities of Christians, Moslems and Hindus. He winked at me. 'Write about it! Your books are read and discussed every­ where. Besides it would be a great success if scholars from all over the world could obtain permission to open the grave from the highest Indian authorities !' 534"},{"pageNumber":595,"pageContent":"'Even an X-ray examination of the grave could supply important evidence ,' I said, 'without disturbing the bones or the mummy or whatever is hidden down there.' 'Perhaps,' said Hassnain resigne dly. On our way back to the Hotel Oberoi I made it abundantly clear to the professor that this tomb could not convince any­ one of the correctness of the assumption that Jesus had been in Kashmir, grown old there and been buried in Srinagar. Hassnain looked at the teeming mass of humanity in the street and said, 'I freely admit that, but think of the docu­ ments!' 'Which documents?' 'Tomorrow I will show you two inscriptions on the Throne of Solomon mountain. One says: 'In this time the prophet Yusu preached .' The date reckoned by the Gregorian calen­ dar is AD 54. The second inscription says: 'He is Jesus, the prophet of the children of Israel.\" , 'Could not one of Jesus' disciples have visited Kashmir in 54 to give rise to the inscriptions. The presence of Jesus was not needed for that.' 'Come to the library tomorrow. There I'll show you the Sanskrit book Bhabishya Maha Purana. It dates to AD 115. On pages 465 and 466 i n verses 17 to 32 a meeting between Jesus and the ruler of Kashmir is described. I am asked about it so often by Western visitors that I always carry a transcript of it in my pocket. 1 can dictate the text on to your tape machine if you like.' If I liked: Now 1 have a tape spoken in English in my archives. This is what Prof essor Hassnain read to me: During the reign of Raya Shalevahin -that was AD 78- the monarch had himself carried over the cool hills of Kashmir. There the king saw a happy person in white linen sitting on the grass, surrounded by many listeners. Shalevahin asked the stranger who he was. The man in the white robe answered in a calm and cheerful voice: 'I was born of a virgin. I am the preacher of the Mlacha religion of the true princi ples.' The king asked: 'What kind of religion is that?' 'Omaharay (great lord), 1 wandered and preached in the land of Mlacha (geographical Palestine) and taught the 535"},{"pageNumber":596,"pageContent":"truth and preached against the destruction of traditions. I appeared there and they called me Masih (Messiah). They did not like my teaching, rejected the traditions and judged me. I suffered much at their hands.' When the king wanted to hear more about the religion which was unknown to him, the man in white linen answered: 'The religion is love, truth and purity of heart, and that is what I was called Messiah for.' . An exciting text! After we had said goodbye outside the Oberoi, I sat out on the balcony for an hour in the early evening by the light of a storm lantern. In one great panorama I saw the river Jhelum which runs through Srinagar and on the slopes the temples from the Hindu period, the fourteenth- and fiftee nth-century palaces and mosques. After an exciting day I regained my calm, reflected on what I had heard and played the tape over and over again. According to this Sanskrit tradition from the year AD 11 S, Jesus-Masih answered the king: 'I was born of a young woman, I taught the truth and preached against destruction of the traditions . .. they rejected the traditions and judged me .. . ' The evangelists also tell us that Jesus was born of a virgin­ a young woman. We know that Jesus preached the genuine doctrine of the tradition since the Dead Sea Scrolls 4 were found in the caves near Qumran in 1947. They give vital information about the beginning of the era which dates from the birth of Jesus. In AD 66 the Essenes put their most valu­ able scriptures in clay vessels and hid them in the caves above Qumran. Found by chance, the caves on the Dead Sea saw the start of a real thriller. S Some scrolls went half-way round the world by routes varying from black to grey; they were put under the micro­ scope in universities and monasteries and gold, too, played a part in the sensational find ... before the unique documents, which transf ormed the theological world picture, came into the safe hands of Professors Andr e Dupon t-Sommer and Millar Burrows.

Some of the Jews, more than 4000 in number, are known as Essenes; in my opinion this name ... is connected with the word 'holiness', for in fact they are men who are especially devoted to the service of God ...

The Jewish historian and general Flavius Josephus (AD 37- 97) wrote as follows about the Essene community in his History of the Jewish War: 7 For there are three philos ophical sects among the Jews: the fo llowers of the first which are the Pharisees, of the second the Sadducees, and the third sect, which pretends to a greater discipline, are called Essenes ... They neglect wedlock, but choose out other people's childr en while they are pliable and fit for learning, and esteem them to be of their kindred, and form them according to their own man­ ners ... But the management and habit of their bodies is such as childr en use ... A priest says grace before meat ... the same priest ... says grace after meat ... They also take great pains in studying the writings of the ancients ... They condemn the miseries of life, and are above pain, by the generosity of their mind ... For their doctrine is this, that bodies are corruptible, and that the matter they are made of is not permanent; but that the souls are im­ mortal ... This psychogram of a community fits in with what we know of Jesus the loner. As a boy born of a virgin, was his education entrusted to the Essenes? Was the Mosaic law that 537"},{"pageNumber":598,"pageContent":"there is only one God so finnly implant ed in him that as a man he despised Roman polytheism and became a rebel? Did he learn from the Essenes to endure and overcome pain and martyrdom on the cross by spiritual strength? Ought we to dismiss it as coinc idence when ancient Sanskrit texts say that the Masih-Messiah told the king that he was born of a maiden and had 'preached the truth against the destruction of the traditions' which was the Essenes' programme? I saw the trail that led from Srinagar 2000 years back to the time of Jesus and yet fu rther back in time to the gods and the mutineers. If in the fu ture I say with conviction that the tomb of Jesus might be located in Srinagar, I know that Asiatic legends will only bring ' a forbearing smile to the faces of Western theologians. But they should combine to explain the Indian legend of Jesus! Is that an improper challenge, a heresy? May we not investigate the tomb of Jesus in Kashmir just because the resurrection should preclude the idea of there being any grave? Is it blasphemy? The question should be answ ered for the sake of the ultimate Christian truth. If the bones of Jesus are really at that place of pilgrimage, Rauzabal Khanyar, that does not alter his noble teachings. We must be pessimistic as St Paul was in I Corinthians, 15.16--17: 'For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised. If Christ has not been raised, your fa ith is futile and you are stiIl in your sins.' Professor Hassnain showed us the ruins of the temple of Parhaspur, a scene of total destruction for kilometres around. The terraced steps of the original complex are clearly re­ cognisable. They immediately reminded me of the stone­ dressing and building methods of blocks fitted into and over each 'other in Inca temples in South America, for example above Cuzco in Peru. Just like there, the masses of stone are sawn out of the rock without apparent effort, here as there, there seems to have been no transport problem. Here, as there, one is forcibly given the impression of an explosive destruc tion, an annihilation that cannot be attribut ed to the passage of thousands of years. A look at the wilderness, like the daily television shots after bombardments of war areas, forces one to think the chaos could not have been created without an explosion on the Hiroshima scale.

I am as familiar with the stories of the gods and their ter­ rible weap ons as I am with my 'one times' table. So to me there is nothing absurd about the idea of destruction from the air. 'Flying machines in old Indian Sanskrit texts.' Professor Dr Dileep Kumar Kanjilal gave a brilliant lecture with this title to the Sixth Congress of the Ancient Astronaut Society in Munich in 1979.8 Kanjilal is a professor at the Calcutta Sanskrit College and therefore a leading scholar in that tongue. Kanjilal's statements, which I can quote with his kind per­ mission, confirm my hypothesis that the 'mutin eers' described in action by Enoch still posses sed technical apparatuses and simple flying machines when the mother spaceship had been relaunched. The rebel angels, the beings from heaven, had intercourse with the daug hters of men and begot children. They were called the 'sons of God' and certainly no longer had the original knowledge of the mutin eers, who had belonged to the first space team and had grown up on a distant planet. The extraterrestrials' technical appliances dis- 539"},{"pageNumber":600,"pageContent":"integrated, rusted and got lost during the first centuries after the landing. The childr en produc ed by the 'mutineers' and their grandchildren grew up on earth. No one had the know­ ledge necessary to repair defective apparatuses. Nevertheless, thanks to the technical tradition of processes, the know-how of their forefathers, they were still able to build simple flying machines which gave them immeasurable superiority over their contemporaries. My ears are open to any other explanation of the processes described in the old Sanskrit texts. They are by no standards obscure secret scriptures. The documents quoted by Professor Kanjilal can be seen in any large Sanskrit library and read, too, if you understand Sanskrit. The message from our Sanskrit scholar in Calcutta is so 'dangerous' for scholars stuck in the same old groove that they�wi thout weapons to defend old points of view---can only ign ore or mock it. They have no arguments against the traditions. I quote from Professor Kanjilal's lecture: There is a tendency to represent the arrival of ex­ traterrestrial gods and their sexual traffic with terrestrial women, which frequently had consequences, as the dis­ covery of the Vedic texts (the oldest religious literatur e of the Aryan Indians) and the Mahabharata (the Indian national epic) . But if we follow the history of idolatry in India we come across two important works, the Kausitaki and the Satapatha Brahma na, dating from about 500 BC and telling us about images of the gods. Text and illustrations show forcefulIy that the gods were originally corporeal beings. But how, and this question must be faced, did these gods reach the earth through the atmosphere ? The Yajurved a quite clearly tells of a flying machine, which was used by the Asvins (two heavenly twins). The Vimana is simply a synonym for flying machine. It occurs in the Yajur veda , the Ramay ana, the Mahabharata, the Bhagatava Purana, as well as in classical Indian literature. Accurately translated the word Yantra means 'mechanical apparatus' and is found widely in Sanskrit literatur e.9 At least 20 passages in the Rigveda (1028 hymns to the gods) refer exclusively to the flying vehicle of the Asvins. 540"},{"pageNumber":601,"pageContent":"This flying machine is represented as three-storeyed, trian­ gular and three-wheeled . It could carry at least three pas­ sengers. According to tradition the machine was made of gold, silver and iron, and had two wings. With this flying machine the Asvins saved King Bhujyu who was in distress at sea. Every Sanskrit scholar knows the Vaimanika Sastra, a collection of sketches the core of which is attributed to Bharadv ajy the Wise around the fourth century BC. The writings in the Vaimanika Sastra were redisco vered in India in 1875. The text deals with the size and the most important parts of the various flying machines. We learn how they steered , what special precautions had to be taken on long flights, how the machines could be protected against vio­ lent storms and lightning, how to make a forced landing and even how to switch the drive to solar energy to make the fuel go further. Bhar advajy the Wise refers to no fewer than 70 authorities and ten experts of Indian air travel in antiquity! The descri ption of these machines in old Indian texts are amazingly preci se. The difficulty we are faced with today is basically that the texts mention various metals and alloys which we cannot translate. We do not know what our ancestors understood by them. In the Amar anganasu­ tradhara five flying machines were originally built for the gods Brahma, Vishnu, Yama, Kuvera and Indra. Later there were some additions. Four main types of fly­ ing Vimanas are descri bed: Rukma, Sundara, Tripura and Sakuna. The Rukma were conical in shape and dyed gold, whereas the Sunda ta were like rockets and had a silver sheen. The Tripura were th ree-storeyed and the Sakuna looked like birds. There were 113 subdivisions of these four main types that differed only in minor details. The position and functioning of the solar energy collectors are described in the Vaimanika Sastra. It says that eight tubes had to be made out of a special glass absorbing the sun's rays. A whole series of details are listed, some of which we do not understa nd. The Amar angan asutra dhara even explains the drive, the controls and the fuel for the flying machines. It says that quicksilver and 'Rasa ' were used. Unfortunately we do not yet know what 'Rasa ' was. 541"},{"pageNumber":602,"pageContent":".

The ruined site of Parhaspur on which I stood might have been the scene of 'divine' air battles. In 1979 a book by David W. Davenport, an Englishman born in India, was published in Italy. Its title was 2000 AC D;struz;one Atom;ca, Atomic Destruction 2000 BC. Davenport claimed to have proof that Moh enjo Daro, one of the oldest sites in the history of human civilisation and one of my destinations, had been destroyed by an atomic bomb. Moh enjo Daro is 350 km north of Karachi in present­ day Pakistan, to the west of Sukkur on the Indus. Davenport shows that the ruined site known as the place of death by archaeologists was not formed by gradual decay. Originally Mohenjo Daro, which is more than 4000 years old, lay on two islands in the Indus. Within a radius of 1.5 km Davenport demonstr ates three different degrees of de­ vastation which spread from the centre outwards. Enormous heat unleashed total destruction at the centre. Thousands of lumps, christened 'black stones' by archaeologists, turned out to be fragments of clay vessels which had melted into each other in the extreme heat. The possibility of a volcanic erup­ tion is excluded because there is no hardened lava or volcanic ash in or near Moh enjo Daro. Davenport assumed that the brief intensive heat reached 2000 °C. It made the ceramic ves­ sels melt. The author says that in the suburbs of Mohenjo Daro ske­ letons of people lying flat on the ground, often hand in hand, were found, as if the living had been suddenly overcome by an unexpected catastrophe. In spite of the interdisciplinary possibilities, archaeology works solely by traditional methods in Mohenjo Daro. They ought to use the former, for it would produc e results. If flying machines and a nuclear explosion as the cause of the ruins are excluded out of hand, there can be no research by enlar ged teams with physicists, chemists, metallurgists, etc. The ruined site of Parhaspur is too extensive for the site of a temple. Indian trad itions mention destruction from the air.

A nuclear explosion 4000 years ago does not fit into the scenario? After rea q ing Davenpor t's book , Monhenjo Daro fa scinated me even more, as what I had learnt so fa r seemed to be only half the truth. Before continuing my journey to the Indus valley, I had to visit my publisher Ajitt Dutt in Calcutta. He and his family were waiting for me at the airport. His cries of delight on receiving the portable typewriter were combined with a torrential account of how they had expected me two days ago and had had to send home several thousand people who had come to hear me lecture. Much as I would have liked to see Calcutta, India's largest city with more than 3.5 million inhabitants and an area of 425 sq km, I hardly set foot outside my hotel room. Journalists struggled for the door handle, radio reporters shoved microphones at me. I refused a television interview 544"},{"pageNumber":605,"pageContent":"when I heard that there were only 20Q0 sets in the city. The television age has only just begun here. The second day passed like the first. What I said the day before was on the front page of the newspapers next to topical political news and photos of Indira Ghandi. (I recognised it from my photogr aph.) What were they writing about me? I cannot read Bengali script, but it looked as if I was in clover. An EvD reception committee appeared at midday with two archaeologists, the director of a museum and several univer­ sity lecturers. As I had already been taught I placed my hands on my breast in an attitude of prayer Bnd bowed . I was told that everything had been well prepared. What I experienced in Calcutta that evening was more riot­ ous than anything in my worst nightmares. When we drove up to the museum in the reception committee's car about six o'clock, I saw crowds being held back by the police. Was this in my honour? The polic e towed me into the inside courtyard . A cordon cleared an alley through which I was squeezed into the hall, a large hall with steps, galleries and wide window­ sills. Every inch, one could say, was plastered with people . The air was hot, humid and stuffy. Four massive chairs, into one of which I was pushed, stood in front of a screen. A lady anthropologist, an archaeologist and the museum director praised me in such eulogistic terms that I felt terribly embar­ rassed. With my watch on the lectern, I stood for a minute without being able to speak through the din. Willi was some­ where in the crowd wearing a bright red shirt so that I could seek him out when I wanted a new slide on the proje ctor. I realised at once that I was going to give an abbreviat ed ver­ sion of my lecture. Nevertheless, my vocal chords gave out three times. That had never happened to me before; it must have been due to the stifling air. A wild tumult broke out when I finished . Thousands thronged to meet me. Until that moment, I did not know how one could be so frightened of people. I was pressed against the wall by autograph hunters, but I could not move my hands. Some distance away I saw Willi who was trying to fight his way to me. The pressure of the throng put me on the floor. With my last ounce of strength I crawled into a comer to reach the protection of two walls. Suddenly I saw the police swinging batons. They laid in with a will, but it did 545"},{"pageNumber":606,"pageContent":"not seem to bother the unrestrained mob. It was an un­ pleasant scene to have to witness. Was there no window through which I could escape? They all had iron bars. Then the police beat a path through to the car. We got in. Exhausted, bathed in sweat, bedraggled ... and fairly happy all the same. The whole of next day I was feeling rather afraid of the second evening lecture at the university. With 240,000 stu­ dents (!) Calcutta has the oldest and largest university in India. I was told that the lecture would take place in the auditorium for nuclear physics, which was the biggest on the campus, and that the public would be mainly acade mic. It did not turn out very academic ally. Things began when I could not get out of the car because it was besieged by students. Once again the police roughly cleared the way. The students did not mind; they shouted in chorus: Long live Daniken! Can you imagine? The auditorium was packed to overflowing. I spoke for two hours. You could have heard a pin drop. The volume of the applause at the end was indescrib able. I sensed a wave of sympathy among the faculty leaders. Professors were ready to help me with their speciali sed knowledge. Sanskrit scholars said they could supply me with a wealth of material from India. They were as good as their word . One scholar assured me that the theories in my books were realities to Hindus that he had always waited fo r. What I wrote was confirmation of the thoughts of the simple man. A shy lanky student handed me a book bound in pink. 'That's for you.' I quickly read the title, Vymaanika-Shaastra Aeronauti cs, by Mah arishi Bharadwaa ja,lo I asked politely what the book was about. The student smiled. 'It is an extremely old collection of texts that will interest you.' He disappeared into the crowd . Back at the hotel I opened my present and was afraid I would have to go back to school to learn Sanskrit, when to my delight I found English translations of the texts starting in the middle of the book. My night's rest was done fo r. Ten sections dealt with uncan nily topical themes such as pilot training, flight paths, the individual parts of flying machines, as well as clothing for pilots and passengers, and the food recommended for long flights. 546"},{"pageNumber":607,"pageContent":"There was much technical detail: the metals used, heat­ absorbing metals and their melting point, the propulsion units and various types of flying machines. If I had not known that I was looking at Sanskrit texts thousands of years old, I would have taken the book for a manual for trainee pilots. There was a check list with 32 in­ structions to pilots which the man in charge of an aircraft had to know before he could fly the machine. Among them were secrets such as how to 'jump' with the flying machine, how to fly in a zig-zag, how the pilot can see on all sides and hear distant noises. There were also instructions about the use of the machines in battle. How an enemy manoeuvre could be recognized in time, how to spot the direction of hos­ tile attacks and then prevent them. The information about the meta i s used in construction name three sorts, soma/a, soundaalika and mourthwika. If they were mixed in the right proportions, the result was 16 kinds of heat-absorbing metals with names like ushnambhara , ushnapaa, raajaam/atrit, etc., which I did not understand. And presumably the translators had not identifi ed them either, or they would have been in English. The texts also explained how to clean metals, the acids such as lemon or apple to be used and the correct mixture, the right oils to work with and the correct temperatur e for them. Seven types of engine are described with the special func­ tions fo r which they are suited and the altitu des at which they work best. The catalogue is not short of data about the size of the machines, which had storeys, nor of their suitabI­ lity for various purposes. I recommend the texts mentioned here to those who doubt the existence of flying machines in antiquity. The mindless cry that there were no such things would have to fa ll silent in shame. The book that came into my hands from the student by chance should be compulsor y reading for aeronautical and aerospace engineers and constructors. Perhaps they will dis­ cover solutions to projects they are sweating over in the Sanskrit texts. Perhaps they will soon be able to take out patents! Copyright in technology so many thousands of years old no longer exists.

But my publisher Ajitt Dutt was very happy. We profited by our previous experiences and left Srinagar at about 4 a.m. At that time the caravans of pedestrians are still camping by the roadside. We drove 100 km, then the natives and the nocturnal sleepers, cows, camels, dogs and goats awoke and buses and lorries roared along, as rashly as tanks into battle. After the great awakening we only covered 40 km an hour and took a good eight hours for the 350 km to Jammu. Jammu, capital of the state of Jammu-Kashmir, was once the winter residence of the north Indian mahara jahs. Today officials from Srinagar winter in the pleasant climate at 403 m above sea level. It is difficult to pick out particular character­ istics in Indian cities. They all overflow with people, they are all bogged down with unregulated traffic, they all have the same filth and they are all domi nated by skinny cows. On the level road leading to Amritsar we wanted to make up for lost time by pressing on fast in order to see the famous 'Golden Temple', the supreme sanctuary of the Sikhs, a re­ ligious community with 8 million adher ents. Founded by gurus in the sixteenth century, the town also has the 'Pool of Immortality', the literal translations of Amritsar. How can a town bear the promis e of immortality in its name? Something unfathomable must have happened here, for under the gold­ clad dome of a building there is also a 'Throne of Immor­ tality'. Today the religious guardians of the Sikhs reside under the dome. At that moment our sturdy Range Rover proved that it was not immortal. There was a blowout in the left rear wheel. Just at high noon. The road was baking. No shadow, not a cloud in the sky. We burrowed under the mountain of luggage for a spare tyre; we wanted to get it over quickly. When I let the jack down, the newly chang ed wheel spread out alarm­ ingly. We had forgotten to replace the air let out for the car's transport by air. The foot pump over which we sweated did not inflate the tyre; it must have been overworked at Karachi airport. Hell! At a pace a snail could have followed we crawled on to the next filling station. 'Do you have air?' I asked, but English is only understood by the upper classes. 548"},{"pageNumber":609,"pageContent":"At such moments one has recourse to a pantomime of signs, just like the first men. I demonstrated pumping movements, puffed out my cheeks and blew hissing air through my lips. No, he had no air, the attendant explained using comical gestures. Air is not normally provided at Indian service sta­ tions. Roasted by the sun, we dawdled on to Lahore. Night was already beginning to fall.· In a workshop a nine-year-old boy inflated the tyre and repaired the damaged tube in a flash. The road from Lahor e to Sukkur via Multan was marked on the map by a red line, which meant that it should be asphalted. From Lahore to Mult an the red line lived up to its promise, afterwards it was terrible. I asked a policeman the shortest way to Sukkur. Asians are sympathetic. If they cannot wrap up a distres­ sing piece of news in polite words, mourning crape descends over their features. What the policeman had to tell us tallied with his mournf ul expres sion. At a distance of only 32 km from Multan the Indus flows past the village of Muzaffar­ garh. Contrary to the seasonal norm, the heavens had opened their sluices; the weather had gone crazy. Although we had sunned ourselves in Srinagar, here the water was absolutely pouring down. Further south on the other side of the Indus it was already impossible to reach Mohenjo Daro. After the policeman, who spoke tolerable English, had consulted the locals, he advised us to drive further south via the dam of Alipur. One can only accept the forces of nature humbly; it is no good getting angry about them. So we drove towards Alipur. The dam was already under water. The floods were washing over the bridges on the two arms of the Indus. However, we were advised to drive 320 km northwards where the dam near Dera Ismail Khan was still open. A gigantic detour, but what could we do? For a long time the speedometer had shown more than the 320 km announced. The road became narrower and finally turned into a muddy country lane. There was no sign of the dam. In a nameless village we heard that the dam of Dera Ismail Khan, too, had been taken over by the Indus hours ago, so we had to make haste. All we had to do was go back southwards for 140 km where the Taunsa dam was still intact and open to traffic according to the latest news. 549"},{"pageNumber":610,"pageContent":"The Taunsa dam is a large structur e with concrete car­ riageways. Tanks could roll over it, but unfortunately the builders had forgotten the access roads. Six o'clock in the evening. We had been on the road for 16 hours and hoped that now it would be plain sailing all the way to Suk kur. Hope springs eternal in the human breast, but ... After I had overtaken a mass of lorries and buses, we came to a river. The road ended somewhere in the mud. What was our cross-country car with four-wheel drive and a winch for? Now I wanted to find out what technology could do. Willi got out, wearing knee-high wellingtons and waded ahead of the car like a sailor on a rolling deck through the bubbling yellow soup so that I could check the level of the water against his long legs. I drove after him at walking pace and fe lt slippery mud under the wheels. I prayed that the car would not stop. After minutes that seemed like hours, I was over the river. Eureka! I had found the other saving shore. What was it Archimedes discovered when he shou ted Eureka? I think it was the law of specif ic gravity. If he had been here, he would have shout ed Eureka two or three times. 550"},{"pageNumber":611,"pageContent":"Although it was night, we wanted to continue. We were stopp ed at the first crossroads and told that all roads to Sukkur were closed as the bridges were flooded. That news sapped all the energy from brain and body and we drove slowly to the haven of Dera Ghazi Khan. Near roadside fires people were selling fruit and vegetables by the light of oil lamps, but against all the rules of salesmanship they looked at us in a most unf riendly, almost hostile manner and were reluctant to give information. A young man of untrustworthy appearance speaking mangled English recommended the Shezan hotel as the best in town . The Shezan was filthy and bug,.ridden with an un­ appetising coffee bar and an interior courtyard with a water­ pump that had not spouted a drop of water for years. A Pakistani who spoke English fluently and kept himself apart from the other men whispered that we ought to be caref ul. Many travellers had been robbed here and the authorities were powerless because the people stuck together like the Mafia. I asked to be allowed to park the Range Rover in the courtyard . Dog-tired and still in our filthy clothes we collap­ sed on to the dirty bedstead. We awoke from an uneasy sleep. The rattle of chains and the sound of a voice came from the courtyard . By the light o f their glaring carbide lamp we watched four men inspecting our car and obviously not because they were curious about Western technology. We went down, stood with our backs to the wall, looking braver than we fe lt, and glared at the men challengingly. My flashlight formed a bulge in my lightweight jacket so that it looked as if I was ready to draw a revolver. Willi was next to me with his arms crossed, holding in his right hand a canister of teargas which we had brought with us on a prophetic im­ pulse. Figures whom we had not seen bef ore emerged from the darkness. They spoke to the four men, and pointed to the bulge under my jacket and to Willi's spray. The gang with­ drew. We left immediately because we suspected that rein­ forcements would be coming. It was a short night. It was not surprising that the road to Sukkur was impass­ able. The roads here are built in a primaeval way. Ox carts bring large stones which Pakistanis hammer into chips. At random they distribute the chips as a foundation, without 551"},{"pageNumber":612,"pageContent":"any binding material. Naturally the tar they pour over it in a thin stream does not stop the Indus from sweeping the surface away every year. Aid from developed countries could really be useful here if it provided instruction in road-making, but not with modem machines, for that would only put the poor locals out of work. Christopher, the patron saint of travellers, withheld his blessing. We had our second punctur e in the middle of the water. The brown Indus broth was up to the hubcap. As St Christopher blesses, but does not help, we plung ed into the clinging mud with the jack. Why isn't there a button inside the car to set a hydraulic pump in motion? In every aircraft life jackets are inflated automatically after being conne cted to a valve. Why do jacks never raise the vehicle high enough? Why do car manuf acturers imagine that punctures always happen on firm ground? As they only drive their cars on testing grounds, they have no idea that tyres can lose air anywhere. If I was a technician, I know how someone could have a guaran teed million-dollar busine ss-even after the zip­ fa stener-by making a jack that could be used in every situ­ ation. In Sukkur which we finally reached after taking many wrong turnings an officer in the Pakistani army told us that it was impossible to drive on southwar ds. The whole area was flooded and it would be weeks before the water subsided and the roads were repai red. Mohenjo Daro, the place of death, did not want us. We left the sinister inaccessible site to our left. Tepe Yahya, the excavated site, the circular Sassanid city of Ardashir Khur rah and the caves near Kermanshah were still on our list of destinations. So on to Iran ... The officer who I asked if the road from Sukkur to Quetta and from there to Iran was passable looked at me un­ comprehend ingly. 'Where do you want to go?' 'To Iran.' 'Haven't you read the papers?' I suddenly realised that I had not seen a newspaper since my arrival in Karachi. Our programme took up every moment of our time.

The latest paper contained the information the office had given us and was dated 20 February. After the fo rces of nature the superior fo rces of politics! We had to give up. So back to the port at Karachi which we knew only . too well. Our baldhead grinned at us. He seemed to enjoy doing so. 'Do you know what we're missi ng?' asked Willi, after we had sat in stunned silence for hours. I pondered . 'Luck!' I said. 'No, the four days after our arrival in Karachi and our three days' wasted driving in the rain.' A week sooner and we should have been in Iran but we should have driven into the revolution which, so we read, showed all the signs of xenophobia. 'No,' I said, 'we were lucky really ... and we will be back again.' No longer in a hurry, owing to the forces beyond our control, we loaded our Range Rover on board a ship in the port of Karachi.

Naturally I could see the dark hatching which led over hills and gorges from the distant background of the picture to the fo reground, standing out clearly from the natural slopes. My Chicago well-wisher had another surprise. He pressed a second photo into my hand, an enlar gement of part of the first. It showed the same trail, but hundreds of small holes were punched in it, as regularly as if a knobbly rolling-pin had been pressed into the ground. I took the normal width of mountain streams as a criterion and estim ated .the strip to be about 15 m wide. I was electrified by these aerial photos. 'What is itT I asked my well-d ressed friend. 'Gods have travelled along it in some kind of vehic le,' he answered, as if he knew all about it. 'Look. It must have been a fantastic vehicle. Can you think of a modern method of locomotion that would leave such marks in the rock or could travel at all at these heights? Just look how the trail goes up the mountains and down into the gorges. That is no product of modern ...

He left me with the two photos and disapp eared with a 'God bless you' into the crowd of guests who turn the foyer of every American hotel into a railway station. Back home in my study I thumbed through a hundr ed books on Peru, feeling sure at first that I would come across the sensational photos. But they did not appear. I found illus­ trations, taken from many angles, of the famous Inca wall which runs for 60 km, from the coast near Paramonga to the Peruvian mountains, flanked to left and right by 14 fortresses. The only feature the Inca wall had in common with the dark dark band in the two photos was the way they both crept over hills and valleys like prehistoric snakes.

But what could this dark band be? Was it rows of ancient graves? Or had a freak of nature caused this accurate and unusual pattern. Was it a sophisticated protective wall? Was it the remains of ancient plantations? The question nagged at me. I must go there, but where? With its 1,285,2 16 sq km, Peru is very large, especially if one is looking for a relatively small area in impassable terrain. Letters flew from my Swiss retreat to my friends in Peru. Every letter contain ed copies of the two aerial photographs and asked the same question: Tell me where it is. For weeks the answers were depress ing. I no longer wanted to open the letters. When I had almost given up, my secretary put an opened letter on my desk. It came from Omar Chioini Carranza, a colonel in the air force. I knew that this friend of mine was recognised as a first-class aviator and amateur archaeo logist. For some years, c o mmissioned by the Air Ministry, he had been' involved in the building of an Aviation Museum in Lima, the capital. Colonel Chioini had circulated my photos among his friends and Peruvian archaeologists. He wrote that one of the arch­ aeologists knew the location of the pockmarked strip. It was in the north of Peru in the spurs of the Andes, north- east of the town of Trujillo, the centre of rema ins of ancient Indian cultures. I must come out. He would be glad to organise the journey to the region; all I had to do was advise him in advance of my date of arrival in Lima. I chose 15 August 1980 for the beginning of the exped ition. As I would be in the region I wanted first to visit EI Baul, a small town in Guatemala to which my friend Dr Gene Phillips had drawn my attention. Extremely interesting and quite neglected statues of the gods are to be found there. It is only a step from Guatemala City to Lima by jet plane. Sitting at my desk with my flight plan all worked out, I had no idea what awaited me in my search for the dark band in Peru. Having learnt from experience, I tried to rent a cross- I could not find the remarkable pockmarked band in any of the books about Peru. What was it? Who laid it out? 559"},{"pageNumber":620,"pageContent":"coun try vehicle in Guatemala City airport. Why car rental finns can only otTer you flashy limousines suitable for good asphalt roads I fail to understan d. In Central and South American countries cross-country vehicles are the only sen­ sible means of locomotion, but there aren't any. The pretty Guatemalan girl at the desk asked where EI Baul was. 'Near Likkin, which is close to San Jose on the Pacific Ocean,' I said, for I had done my homework. The channing lady showed her toothp aste-ad teeth. 'You don't need a cross-country car there. The roads are in perfect condi tion.' If a man with brown teeth had made such a promise, I would not have fa llen for it. On the pretty lady's re­ comm endation, I accepted a big American Dodge for 28 quetzal a day plus II cents a kilometre. The quetzal is the currency of the country and one quetzal is worth one US dollat. Outside the city a four-lane motor way leads with a great many curves into the deeper lying region in the direction of Escu intla. Apparently my Guatemalan beauty had not been lying. It started like a tourist trip, but the joyride ended after only 20 km, outside Escuintla. Dripping jungle steamed on both sides of the road. Buses and lorries stuck close together and sent out sooty plumes of noxious exhaust gas. Overtaking was out of the question. As fa r as the eye could see there was a queue of stinking monsters crawling round the hairpin bends at a snail's pace. The only thing that impressed me about Escuintla, a miserable dump, were potholes as deep as wells. What must axles and shock-absorbers sutTer under heavy loads? I should not have fallen for the smiling assur­ ance that I did not need anything except the Dodge. The road forked. The main road led westwards to the Mexican border, my route went south along the CA9 to San Jose. It was only partially asphalted and the Dodge creaked into and over potholes as deep as a bathtub and groaned over lumps of stone when they were too close together to drive round. On my right I was accompanied by a stream about two metres wide that would undoubtedly overflow the road if there was heavy rain. But it wasn't raining, at least not on that day.

I wanted to be in peak condition for next day's drive to EI Baul. The madonna of the airport was still smiling at me when I fe ll asleep. A lot can happen overn ight, both pleasant and unpleasant. When I pulled back the curtains in the morning, the sky was full of heavy clouds. Looking on the bright side, I thought that at least the sun would not turn the Dodge into an oven . In the jungle, clouds of this massive kind sometimes thre,!ten without breaking. One can even escape them in a good cross­ country vehicle. I had just reached the route, when the heavens opened their sluices with a deluge of such proportions that they might have been trying to fill ten lines in the Guinness Book of Record s. It was no first time for me; I have known heavy tropical rain before, but what happened on this 12 August exceeded all my previous experiences. The stream that had been on my right the day before now grumbled on my left and rose menacingly until it overfl owed the road, sweep ing along uproot ed trees, stones and small animals. Only suicides or greenhorns unus ed to the jungle would continue in these cond itions. I stopped, took the tow­ rope out of the boot, already up to my knees in water, and tied it round a massive mahogany tree. During my disagreeable paddle in the yellowish-brown broth I saw the smile of the seductive Guatemalan like a mene tekel on the surface of the water. If only I had a cross­ country car! Their axles �re higher; they allow the water to flow unhind ered between the wheels and the engine is better protected against water and dust. The brown soup frothed in front of the Dodge as if it were the bow of a ship. I took off my shoes and jeans, piling the luggage as high as possible on the rear seat and on the ledge under the rear window, for the stream had long since forced its way into the car.

After two hours the deluge ended as suddenly as it had started . Presumably the angels had emptied all the celestial swimming pools and switched on the sun again. Suffocating vapours . rose over the jungle as if from a mediaeval wash­ house. The birds twittered and crowed proudly as if they had closed the sluicegates. A cowboy wearing a rig-out decorated with silver and a black sombrero rode up to my car as it lay at anchor to inform me that the banks of the stream had colla psed in many places and the road was damaged. He advised me to take care if I was driving on. That had already occurred to me without his horse-borne information service . Three hours elapsed before the water subsided a little. The road was still under dark water that hid the potential dangers. I took the protective covering off the engine and got it to go after a fe w false starts, a bit of luck I tried to preserve by driving fa st through the spray . The engine was ceaselessly baptised from below. My intention of getting away from the scene quickly and avoiding the swarms of mosquitoes which had simultaneously declar ed my body their feeding ground failed. A victim of the deluge, I pushed and pulled my car out of the mud, often with the help of farmers. Thirty-eight km beyond San Jose the level of the road rose above the bed of the stream .

EI Baul is a little hamlet a few kilometres from Santa Lucia Cotzumalguapa . You find its attraction in a wooden shelter with no sides and open to wind and weather, next to a sugar­ cane fa ctory.

'Monument No. 27' is a stele 2.54 m high and 1.47 m wide. The stone sculptur e is domi nated by a figure standing with arms akimbo, rather self-confidently it seemed to me. It wears what look like boxing gloves and the hands hold balls the size of tennis balls. On its feet the figur e wears boots which reach to the knees and have trousers like knickerbockers tucked into them. A broad belt separates the trousers from the close-fitting upper part. To that extent the figure could be dressed in the fa shion of its day, but the helmet enclosing its head is amazing. Like a modern diving suit, it ends on the shoulders in broad bulges. A tube leads from the back of the helmet to a small tank-like chest, a container. The helmet leaves a peephole free for the eyes protected as if with a transparent disc. Behind it you can make out an eye with an eyebrow, the beginning of a nose and part of the nose. Now the stone object becomes even more remarkable. As 563"},{"pageNumber":624,"pageContent":"The 2.54 m tall figure. with arms akimb o, wears 'boxing gl oves' and holds 'tennis balls'. a direct extension of the nose, but outside the helmet, the stonemason has modelled an animal snout, possibly a jaguar' s. The figure's breath emerges from the snarling jaws, as if it was being forced out. It has two bands round its neck, one of which ends on the breast in a small square chest, the other in a round object, perhaps an amulet. This helmet wearer must have been somebody important, fo r a small figure crouches fearfully at his feet on the ground. It, too, wears boxing gloves and holds a tennis ball which it offers to the mighty one. To complete the relief, a broad rectangle at the foot of the stele contains six indefinable gob­ lins. In the view of the archaeologists the relief is supposed to represent a scene from the traditional deadly dangerous Mayan ball game and the victor wears the mask of an ape, a jaguar or perhaps an opossum, for then the tube from helmet to tank would simply be the little creature's tail and the 'air' fr om the mouth would symbolise water. The opossum is an aquatic animal. 564"},{"pageNumber":625,"pageContent":"Which is the more fa ntastic, to make out an opossum on the stele or to see parts of a clearly recognisable technique? How blind must one have become by blinkered study to 'be­ lieve' that an opossum, ape or jaguar dips its tail over its shoulder into a container on its back? Unfortunately one cannot find the first bold 'discoverer' who explained the recognisable stylised breath as the symbol of water. He must have been smart, this interpreter of images, for his rumination was acclaimed and put in the textbooks and once something is in them, it is declar ed taboo by scho­ larly opinion. I did not find a single word explaining what the tank meant. An animal accessory? Scientific belief does not need an explanati on. One has to believe. Basta: enough. The idea of the Mayan ball game would be an attempt at an explanation, were it not for the properties which, apart from the balls, are unne cessary and even a hindr ance in a ball game. Even the Maya would hardly play in trousers and boots, and tight-fitting overalls. I agree with Sir Alexander Fleming and refuse to clutter up my brain with the prevailing dogma. My interpretation is as follows. Two extraterrestrial beings, 'gods', had a fight; the van­ quished god offers the victor his weapon and begs for mercy . Or, only the large figure represents a divinity and a kneeling ruler or priest is begging for the favour of the mighty alien. The dominating figure is the victor, who is dressed differently from the earthly one; he protects himself from bacteria and viruses on what to him is an alien planet with hennetically sealed clothing. Earth-born locals did not need this protec­ tion; they were immune to the native bacteria and causes of infectious diseases. That also explains the closed-circuit breathing apparatus. The alien draws filtered air into his helmet from the tank through a tube. The Indians around El Baul still worship this stele as the representation of a great alien god. Until a few years ago they lit candles at the figure's feet. The Indians of Guatemala are Maya, descendants of those Maya who built the grandiose temples and pyram ids. According to the ancient Maya beliefs matter had a soul, like the stele of EI Baul, which contains mana. 565"},{"pageNumber":626,"pageContent":"A creature with an elephant's head on a human body greets us from a temple wa ll on Monte Alban in MeKico.

Mont e Alban, capital and religious centre of the Zapoteks, and its complexes were dated to 600-- 100 BC. How did the Zapoteks know about elephants at that time? Sacrosanct sci­ ence says that they only existed in Africa or Asia. If I am told-and nothing is too silly to be advanced-that elephants and mammoths made their way to America via the Bering Straits 12,000 to 15,000 years ago, then Monte Alban must be dated synchronously to 12,000 BC. One cannot have it both ways- lOOBc and elephants! Take it easy. There were no elephan ts. As elephant relief s are in fa ct exhibited on the walls at Mont e Alban the stonemasons depicted something that was unknown to them. Yet I have read, I swear it, that Egypt's Pharaoh Rameses III (1195-1164 BC) sent a fleet to Mexico and in that way elephant pictures arrived across the high seas. Good heavens! Rameses' elephants in Mexico! There are also archaeologists who are unable even to see elephants in the Central American depicti ons of trunks. They see an extinct species of bird.2 Birds with trunks, that's not bad! These gentlemen should buy themselves spectacles! I harbour the suspicion that the beings with trunks are neither elephants nor birds. In the Anthropological Museum of Mexico City I stood in front of a massive kneeling figure with a broad flat skull and eyes set wide apart. A trunk, which disappears into a strange swelling on the chest, pro­ trudes from the middle of the skull. Anyone who defines this monster as an elephant must accept an extraterrestrial import. Elephants on our earth look quite different. Between the pyramids at Tikal, in Guatemala, there is a large stone in the grass that has been exposed to the ravages of thousands of years. The once precise contours have been worn away by wind and weather. But if you take a close look, the outlines of a figure are still discernible. It, too, carried a tank on its back or chest. You can still make out a cog wheel from which a trunk, or more likely a tube, leads to the top of the torso. Strang e? It is said that the Maya did not possess the wheel.

My industrious friend Dr Gene Phillips photographed two perfect cog wheels perpetuated in stone in the Maya ruins at Copan, Honduras. Equidistant spokes lead from the hub to the rim, the exterior of which is marked with the broad teeth of a cog wheel. As this truly sensational find can never be accepted as a cog wheel, I look forward gleef ully to the evening when some terribly clever TV professor peers out of the long-suf fering screen to tell us that it represents the teeth of the rain god, the stone teeth of the patron saint of maize farmers or a high priest's bundle of bootlaces.

The Sunday archaeologist, Dr Gene Phillips, a lawyer from Chicago, has his eyes open, as befits his profession. Between the ruins of a temple wall, he spotted and photographed two busts which do not fit into any scenario, and theref ore have not found the shelter of a museum. The busts, without abdomens, wear a broad bib which the wearer originally pulled over his head through the hole in the middle and let it hang down over his shoulders.

Unchang ed during the years I had known him, a gentleman of perhaps 60, with hair streaked with grey, a neatly trimmed moustache, heavy dark eyebrows and wrinkles caused by laughter round his eyes.

He had also tried to get hold of the architect Carlos Milia, but had been told by his wif e that Carlos was unavailable over the weekend and could not be phoned until Monday.

If anyone could give me the inf ormation it was Carlos MilIa. I 'had not the slightest desire to wait in Lima. I knew the city with its important museums from earlier visits. I had been in the 350-year-old cathedral with its precious, carved choir stalls, consi dered to be the most beautif ul in America. The building was consecrated in 1624 and Francisco Pizarro, the Spanish conqueror of Peru, laid the foundation stone. Numerous earthquakes and architectural taste changing with each reconstruction have made the cathedral into a calendar of art history, in which one can distinguish Gothic, Baroque and Classical elements. I admired the splendid houses from the colonial period with their spacious inside courtyards and their art treasures carved out of fine jungle woods or ham­ mered and chiselled from iron. In the centre I know the Plaza de Armes where Francisco Pizarro drew the plan of the city on the ground with his sword in AD 1535.

The bushes with their delicate leaves and yellowish clusters of flowers are cultivated in plantations. The first travellers in the Andes related that chewing coca leaves gave the natives strengt h.

To the left of the main road a narrow lane leads south-east over the closed-down overgrown railway line from La Paz to Lake Titicaca. There stands a grass-cover ed hill surrounded by a wire fence. In specialist literatur e the little hill is described as a 'pyrami d', although there is nothing pyramidal about it. At the foot of the hill lies a monolith as if it had been hurled there by a giant. The Swiss travel-writer Johann Jakob von TschudP saw it in 1869 and wrote this: On the way to Puma Punka we found in a field a strange monolith 155 em high by 162 em wide; it is 52 em thick at the base and 45 em thick at the top.

A t the top of the hill you can see the mystery of the Andes, Puma Punku, a stone structure of incredible power, variety and precisi on. Its purpose has never been understood nor has it been adequately appraised in any modern work known to me. In the latest large general work about South America4 Puma Punku is dismissed in these few lines: In the south-west corner of Tiahuanaco stands the great pyramid called Puma Punku. Two areas of different heights form its upper platf orm which is reached up several steps. A temple probably stood on one of the platforms, the en­ trance to which consisted of three portals executed in the style of the Gate of the Sun. That is miserly, as if the Berlin Philharmonic were to play the 16 upward beats of the 'Eroica' to represent the whole work. Let us devote our fu ll attention to Puma Punku! The descendants of the Spanish conquerors brought the first news to the old world. In the middle of the sixteenth century Pedro de Cieca 5 described Puma Punku as a unique site with 'gigantic statues and a vast terrace. No one has seen the uncanny place other than in ruins.' His fe llow countr yman Antonio de Castro y del Castillo, who was Bishop of La Paz in 1651, wrote: And although it was formerly assumed that the ruins were the work of the Inca, as a fortress for their wars, it has now been realised that they are structures from before the 579"},{"pageNumber":641,"pageContent":"Flood ... For if it had been a work of the Inca in a plain without water, and set so deeply into the groun d, not even the Spaniards could have const ructed such a wonder fu l building or one so beautif ul. What I marvel at are those stones that fit one another so accurately . . . 6 In the first half of the nineteenth century the French palaeontologist Alcide Charles Victor d'Orbigny (1802-57) travelled through South America. Describing Puma Punku,7 he wrote about monumental gates which stood on horizontal stone platforms. He says that one of the complete platforms was 40 m long. Today there are no such conne cted slabs to be see n; they have collapsed, shatter ed and eaten by the teeth of time. But what remains is monumental enough to leave us awestru ck. As a 'collector' of ancient buildings it is hard to impress me, but Puma Punku, this grandiose panorama from another age, left me speechless. Massive lumps of granite, andesite and diorite, the grey-green plutonic rock of enormous hard­ ness and resistance, lie about in a confusing chaos that still allows you to sense their original arrangement. The mono­ liths, which are simply astonishing, are dressed, cut and polished with such precision that they might have been de:­ livered from a workshop with ultramodern machines, hard steel milling tools and drills. Extremely accurate grooves 6 mm wide and 12 mm deep run along diorite monoliths over 5 m long as if drawn by a ruler. The monsters were conn ected with their counterparts by mortises. Metal clamps united the stone monsters into a structure which eludes imaginative re­ construction today.

After some years of joint research Uhle and Stubel edited the stan­ dard work Die Ruine nstiitten von Tiahuanaco im Hochland des alten Peru. It is 58 cm h igh, 38 cm wide, weighs 10 kg and contains detailed drawings of Puma Punka, and data that are accurate to the millim etre and have not been improved on to this day. The sketches accom panying my text are taken from the work published in Leipzig in 1892. The two scholars were fascinated by Puma Punku. Faced with the incomprehensible complex, they decided to take accurate measurements and sketches of the layout home with them. It is conceivable that they were not driven merely by scientific zeal, but by the worry that otherwise their account of the mystery of the Andes would not be believed. The on­ the-spot impressions were too powerf ul. Stubel noted: The most remarkable feature of the ruins of Puma Punku is fo rmed by the still extant 'platforms' and the whole or broken blocks lying scattered between them which exhibit ex­ traordinary diversity in their shape, size and workmanship. There are platform -like stones, symmetrically dressed lava stones, others with small gate-like excisions, stones with depressions like basins, stones with ornaments like crosses, with small niches and thick or quite thin embossed mould­ ings, as well as countless other shapes. With the excep tion of the three main platf orms, which run in a straight line, the present state of th e ruins is extremely disordered. The three so-called main platf orms, run in a north-south direction. They cover an area 43 m long and some 7 m wide .9 Max Uhle had to stand by and watch a unit of the Bolivian In the first half of the nineteenth century the archaeol og ist d'Orbigny reckoned that the stone platforms still had a total length of 40 m.

If the builders of Puma Punku had not planned their complex fo r etern ity, only a mass of rubble or not even that would have been left. Puma Punku means Gate of the Lion. Today there is no sign of a gate, for the Spaniards and after them the Indians broke up many of the stones and took away whatever they could carry or drag. But even if Spaniards, Indians and the whole Bolivian army had combin ed in a communal robbery, they could not have altered the position of the gigantic dressed platf orms. Could it be done today? In 1964, for example, Abu Simbel was sawn into sections, numb ered and put together again 60 m above its fo rmer site close to the Nile, using the massed technology of Western industry. Nothing of that kind has been attempted at Puma Punku . So far, we still do not know how deep the andesite and diorite blocks and platforms stick into the ground . So far excavators have not been able to lift the biggest blocks, thank heavens. If they were transportable, they would be exploded and disappear as cheap long-lasting building material in the walls of pompous office blocks or stores, or at best recon­ structed by diligent archaeologists in the very places where they do not belong. Nevertheless, the terrain, as Siegfried Huber lo writes, gives one the impression of a busy building site: The area gives one the impression of a stonemason's workplace; the masters and apprentices have just left for their tea break to return immediately to work with hammer and chisel. A vast mount of skilfully dressed and polis hed material, platforms, blocks, millstones, fragments of fr iezes, stone seats and doors seem to be waiting for trans­ port. If you see what is anchor ed in the ground at Puma Punku, the method of transport to and from the sites remains a mys­ tery. Alcide d'Orbigny relates that he saw the main platf orms, now divided into three, still in one piece over 40 m long. A block of stone 40 m long and 7 m wide buried to an unknown depth has the volume of an eleven-stor ey house. The raw mass must have been much more voluminous, because it had to be 584"},{"pageNumber":645,"pageContent":"fa shioned and dr essed first. In places where stone is worked, chips are left behind. There is no stone debris at Puma Pu nku. To sum up: the stone masses weighing many thousand tons must have been transported over the treeless plateau by human muscular strength in the abs ence of modern lorries and cranes. Anyone who says lightheartedly that it was all fe asible should remember that one thousand tons equals one million kilograms and that many thousand tons were moved at Puma Punku! Were the celebrated wooden rollers pushed under these stone mo nsters as well? Only people who talk about colour like blind men could risk that theory. Wooden rollers would have been crushed and split. If transport columns had managed to get the burden fr om some site to the slopes and just one tropical rainstorm had fa llen, the stones would have vani shed like raisins in a cake, sunk in the morass. The transport was eff ected somehow, oth erwise there would be no stone pla tforms and monoliths at Puma Punku. Ho w? This is the mystery without a convincing solution. The precision of the works is as mysterious as their trans­ port. Example 1: We have a recta ngular block 2.78 m long and 1.57 m wide, with an average height of 88 cm . The block has six main su rf aces: top, bottom and fo ur sides. The six surf aces are divided into small and large su rf aces, with each surf ace on a diff erent plane. To explain: on the lateral su rface B surf aces (I) to (7) are · I cm higher or deeper than their neighbour. Surf aces (6) and (7) are separated by a ledge of 5 cm thilt narrows to a cornice 4 cm thick. The narrow moulding (8) running dead straight between surf aces C and D is only 2 cm wide. The block is wedg e-shaped. The rear part (in Figure 1) is thicker than the fr ont. Nowadays such pre cision work-if there was a stonemason to take it on-would be executed with the help of milling tools and high-s peed drills cooled by air, water or artificial ice. The work was made particularly dif ficult because it had to be carried out on diorite, a stone as hard as granite.

Apart from the two elements fitting into each other, an apparatus was necessary to allow them to fit without the stone mOUldings splintering during opening or closing. Wooden rollers or the arm of a lever would not have been adequate to allow blocks weighing tons to slam to like safe doors. The process presumably took place on the heights, not after the blocks were lying on the ground.

As regards the transport of the stone masses, the builders must have known their weights and taken stability and hard­ ness of the material into account.

The possibility that a genius, a once-in-a-millennium archi­ tect, ftexed his muscles here can be excluded. Given so many building sites with the attendant transport, stone dressing, instructions to the masons, etc., even a genius would have crumbled, quite apart from the fact that, if done by human powers, the topping-out cerem ony could not have been celebrated in one man's lifetime, or even in several genera­ tions. Result: As planning is obvious, we must credit the builders with knowledge of writing. But, and there the archaeologists and ethnologists are wonderf ully unanimous, the Aymara had no writing. Which means their exclusion as the builders! There can be no building plan without detailed drawings. They existed at Puma Punku. Even the archaeologists speak of 'copper clamps' with which the blocks were supposed to have been held together. Copper is a weak materi al. It is only 3 on the Mohs scale of hardness, as oppos ed to iron with 4.5. Copper could not chain together slabs weighing tons. Johann Jakob Tschudi4 already had something to say about this: Even more astonishing than the transport of these enor­ mous masses of stone is the perfect technical execution of the stonemason's work, especially when we think that the ancient Indian artisans had no iron tools and that the alloys of copper and tin known to them were much too weak to dress granite successf ul,ly.

The most suitable spot for you is 2 km past the village of Humay in the Pisco valley. Drive to the Hacienda Mont esierpe. Behind the hacienda there is a strip of cultivated land 300 m wide. Immediately above it on the barren hills you can see your strip with the holes.' If correct, it was a useful piece of information. On the map the Pisco valley runs at right-angles to the Panamericana, one of the dream roads of the world. I paid over the 200 dollars and promised Carlos Milla future business if I wanted to track down other mysterious places in Peru. If anyone is 604"},{"pageNumber":665,"pageContent":"interested, the address of the topographical expert is: Architect Carlos Milla, Avenida Salaverry 674, Lima. Immediately after the conversation, I telephoned my acquaintance, Professor Dr Janvier Cabrera, in lea, which is only 70 km from Pisco. Perhaps he knew the Hacienda Montesierpe, perhaps he would like to come with us. Cabrera, an unorthodox anthropologist, agreed on the spot. We arranged to meet the next day at 1700 hours in the Museum of lea. The journey in a rented Datsun took a good four hours. For 40 km outside Lima the Pan americana is built like a genuine motorway, then it narrows to a single lane which runs along the coast, but mostly through desert. Although the coastal strip down to Pisco on the Pacific lies in a geo­ graphical zone which allows luxuriant vegetation to flourish in other parts, that is not the case here. The cold water of the Humboldt current cools the hot atmos phere heated by the sun so that one must count on fog both morning and evening. But because the fog is dried out in higher, hot layers of air, there are hardly any precip itations. Long stretches of the dream road show the result. You see dunes, fields covered with pebbles and the uprooted trunks of plants like thistles drying out on the sand of the desert. The locals form them into letters on hillsides, like gigantic advertising slogans. The scenery changes abruptly: luxuriant valleys with cotton fields and fruit-and sugar-cane plantations on both sides of the road. By the roadside Indians sell fr uit, vegetables and of course pisco, their favourite spirit, and wine in fat-bellied bottles. No sooner are you used to seeing such cases of fer­ tility, when there is a harsh cut in the landscape film, and it continues with the absolute desolation of the desert, the whole region a kaleidos cope of sea, mist, uninhabited desert and strips of fertile land. Buses dash along at excessive speeds carrying tourists to Nazca. The tourists doze, thanks to the indispensable air­ conditioning. A good sweat would be more beneficial, but people demand this cursed comf ort. I am waiting for Professor Cabrera. Skulls taken from ancient graves around lea stare out from the museum's showcases. They are deformed. The def orma- 605"},{"pageNumber":667,"pageContent":"tions begin at the temples, then arch back upwards from the temples like the body of a hornet. The back part of the head often has three times the volume of a normal skull. In erudite tomes I find this explanation of the monsters. Inca priests selected boys at a very tender age and put their still malleable little heads between padded boards. Cords were pulled through hinges and slowly and steadily reduced the space between the boards. Some children must have suffered indescribable torments in the process, otherwise we should not have these deformed adult skulls. The sight of these monstrous heads, which might have come from the Gothic novel Frankenstein by Mary Shelley (1797-1851) , spurred me to ask questions. Why did this agonising ritual take place? How did men get the idea of deforming children's skulls? Skulls of this kind are no Peruvian or South American spe­ ciality. They are found among the Maya in Central America, in the north-west of the USA among the flathead Indians, as well as in ancient Egypt. 1 J The various peoples seem to have been copying some­ thing. Is it true-after all, no one was there-that the deformed were chosen to become future priests and high priests ? Why? Did children have to be misshapen so that their adult skulls would resemble those of the ancient gods? Did man once meet intelligent beings who inspir ed respect and strive to re­ semble them, externally at least? Were the priests using a barbarous trick to con jure up the omnip otence attributed to the vanished figures with these highly individual head masks? Did the priests mean these overs ize skulls to show that they were different from the common people and formed an elite? Possibly, for their rituals are supposed to have taken place in secret. If these unpleasant relics of a brutal past were confined to the territory of a single people, special religious reasons might lie behind the custom, but they are found in widely separated regions on different continents. Was skull de­ formation practised to imitate the heads of alien beings seen I photographed thase deformed skulls in the Museum of lea. Have they anything to tell us? 607"},{"pageNumber":668,"pageContent":"by men when they visited the earth? Were deformed skulls intended to salvag e something of the aura of the powerful masters in a distant fu ture-a t least visually? If only one of these questions could be answered affirmatively, these skulls could provide significant indications of the appearance of the extraterrestrials who blessed our forefathers with their pres­ ence in the very very distant past. Professor Cabrera ended my meditations with warm tor­ rential greetings in the best South American style. We drank a pisco sour and I show ed him the photos of the hole-ridden band which ran through his homeland. He did not know it and was rather dubious when I assur ed him that it ran over h i lI and dale barely 100 km from lea. 'In the Pisco valley? I know it well; I've flown over it many times. I know the Hacienda Montesierpe, too. But I've never seen this remarkable band,' Cabrera admitted. He was still sceptical the next morning when we drove along the Pan americana to Pisco. Every time I drive through Pisco, my stomach rebels. Pisco stinks; I do not know any other town that sends up such noisome smells. A large fishing fleet is anchor ed in the harbour. The factories nearby are not manuf acturing attar of roses, but malodorous fish manure. The 'aroma' of Pisco, a cloud of fish oil, also lingers loath­ somely over the coast road. It reminded me of my childhood when my mother used to dose me with big spoonf uls of cod liver oil, because of the vitamins which childr en need for growth. Children are better off today; they swallow pleasant­ tasting vitamin tablets. Hens are fed horrif ying amounts of fish manure with the result that eggs and chicken meat taste fishy. In other parts of our humane world the idea of battery hens spoils my appetite for the chickens I once loved to eat, here the fish-hen smell did the trick. It was a marvellous day with blue skies that raised my hopes of success. Four kilometres north of Pisco a rough road leads into the Pisco valley to Humay, then up into the high Andes to Castrovir reyna and Huancavelica. In the fields which are irrigated, fruit and vegetables thrive. The abrupt transition from desert to cultivated landscape and vice versa is consistently irritating. Rocky hills and sand dunes flanked the tortuous narrow road. After 31 km we passed through the town of Humay and in 608"},{"pageNumber":669,"pageContent":"North of Pisco a dirt road leads into the Pisco valley and then upwards into tha high Andes. five minutes we reached the Hacienda Montesierpe. We drove into the courtyard, which had seen better days. The fonner seignorial house had been turned into cottages. There was also a church, the roof of which had fallen in, and small statues with their heads lying in the mud. Paintings flutt ered from the walls of the big house and the church. After the first land refonn under the then socialist military government, when the owners were driven out, everything of any value went to rack and ruin. Only the most essential things were repaired. The Indians are as badly otT as before the revolu­ tion. An unjust regime was overthrown, another one of the same calibre assumed power and the suff erer was the little man. Brown-skinned childr en with large dark eyes crowded round us, wearing dresses and trousers that were too large or too small. They were ragged and pitifully dirty. The revolu­ tion promised a new paradise. Nothing has changed. Once again all that happened was a transf er of power. Professor Cabrera went into the house and I followed him. 609"},{"pageNumber":670,"pageContent":"He showed my photos to a fat woman who was seated at a spinning-whe el. Next to her there was a huge pile of oranges above which tatter ed brightly colour ed shirts were drying on clothes lines. Cabrera and the woman fired salvoes of words at each other that my limited Spanish could not follow. He came back and said that the matron did not know it and had never seen anything like it. I remember Carlos Milla, the architect, and his claim that I would find my goal only 300 m from this hacienda. Surely the lady, who had certainly never left the place in her life, ought to have known about it. A broken-down tractor rattled into the yard. Cabrera went straight to the two men and asked for information. I kept in the background, reading what was said and thought from their faces. At long last one of the two tractor drivers indi­ cated that he knew something. With an infinitely tired gesture he point ed to the mountains behind the hacienda. Without waiting for Cabrera's news, I shou ldered my .cameras. The cultivat ed land behind the hacienda is only a strip of 250 m. One after the other, we climbed the first hill on a narrow path and checked the countryside around us, but there was no sign of the band with the holes : We panted on. The sun was beating down and the air was oppressive. We took a break and sat down. The light was glaring, the sun stood perpendicularly above us and there was hardly any shade. Nowadays I have problems with my eyes; they often hurt and cannot stand bright light. I sometimes think that it started this midday when I strained to find contours, points of reference and small hints in the blinding light. My eyes smarted then as they do today when I sit at my desk and write by the bright lamplight. Sometimes the lines blur and flicker like the slopes of the hills and the verges of the desert. Did my eyes deceive me? In the shimmering iridescent air black stripes stood out on the other side of the valley, a black snake which clung to the hills. I said nothing, but took the tele-objective and checked my observ ation. It conf irmed what I had seen with my bare eyes. Somewhere out of the distan t haze the band crept over hill and dale to end in the area of cultivated land in the Pisco valley. In my mind I built up a further piture of the formation. An extension of it ought 610"},{"pageNumber":671,"pageContent":"Dark stripes stood out in the shimmering air. The band crawled towards us from the distance. to lead in our direction. I handed the tele-ob jectiv e to Cabrera and indic ated the point he was to look at. He saw what I saw, I was sure of that. We had to climb very steeply to get a better look. We panted. We clam bered on to the ridge of the mounta in. To our right and left there were nothing but arid valleys, scree, shimmering air and yet more scree which you could not take you r eyes off. We stumbled. Then I stumbled into the first hole of the dark band ... I knew at once that this was it! Professor Cabrera, the sceptic, scratched the back of his sweaty head, stared at the ground and said, 'Erich, we're here!' The hole I stumbled over was one metre deep and one metre in diameter. Next to it there were a second, a third and fourth hole, a veritable band pierced with holes that unfolded into the distance as far as the eye could see. I looked up, 611"},{"pageNumber":672,"pageContent":"When I stood before the first hole in the ground. I knew that we had reached my goal. followed the route taken by the holes and saw it disappear fa r above beyond the mountains. Five hundred metres above the hacienda we stood by the foremost row of holes. All the holes were empty, except for a little crumbled scree. They were simply there, just as in my first impression from the old photos, like an exact pattern impressed into the earth by a rolling-pin. We followed the trail of holes upward, climbing the mountain like weary war­ riors, but secretly glad to have reached our goal. Every time we went a little higher, the holes chang ed. More and more often they were surrounded by stones. Sometimes we saw little walls piled up around them. On the ridge of the mountain every hole was enclosed by a wall. In an endless line the holes clung to the sloping sides of a valley like a snakesk in. It looked as if Indian pioneers, acting on orders, had simultaneously dug into the ground, side by side on a band 24m wide. There was room for a man in each hole. Had it been a defence installation? That was the first ques- 612"},{"pageNumber":673,"pageContent":"We followed the band 88 far as the eye could see.

That runs counter to any kind of rational strategy. The soldiers could not have hanned the attackers if they were coop ed up in holes in the ground. The course taken by the bank also refutes the assumption of a def ence installation. If it covered only the tops of hills and mountains it could have fulfilled a pur­ pose. From above-if there was anything to defend up there­ the attackers, fighting uphill, would have had to show them­ selves; they would have been within the field of vision. Major defence works such as the Inca wall in Peru and the fa mous Great Wall of China dominate mountain ridges. Logic ally. Mediaeval knights planted their castles on mountain tops fr om which any enemy in the valley was visible. None of that applies here, because the band with the holes often clings to the slopes in the valleys in gentle elegant curves. If the holes 61 3"},{"pageNumber":674,"pageContent":"had been one-man bunkers for defenders, they would often have been lower down than the onrushing enemy army. So what purpose did the hundreds and thousands of holes fulfil? Clay soil which would have made digging child's play never existed here; the ground was always stony hard and dry. But why had men undertaken such strenuous work? We crouched in the holes next to each other. We looked up the mountain and down into the valleys, following the band into the distance where the harsh shimmering heat haze swallow ed it up. Was it a burial place? It would be the only one in the world , laid out over many, many kilom etres, whose graves were never discovered. Burial places always exhibit something that points to their purpos e--m emorial stones, the remains of bleached bones and· funerary gifts. There was n.othing up here to point in that direction. Did the holes mark the territorial boundaries of some monar ch or state? Even to primitive minds the cost of digging the holes would have been colossal. Stones placed next to each other would have served the purpose. Would men have also put boundary demarcations on the steep sides of valleys? Even a dictator, who forced his subjects to carry out this work, would have accepted the course of a river as a boun­ dary. But the band with holes frequently runs along 'such slopes, now straight, now curved, an unpar alleled infrastruc­ ture. It was certainly not a boundary line. So what was it? Were signs set up here to form a line of signals? Can we imagine that on dark nights -on the birthday of a king or a priest-hundreds of thousands of Indians cowered in the holes and lit torches on the word of command? A chain of lights illumi nated by the brillian ce of the streets of Las Vegas? Come now, they did not need holes.in the ground for that; all the Indians had to do was stand in line. Are we dealing here with signs for the gods, as on the plain of Nazca, only 180 km to the south as the crow flies? Has the band as astronomically determined alignment ? So fa r that has not been investigated . The old photographs from the National Geogra phic are forgotten, the band of holes is unknown. It is not mentioned in a single book.

It is a tax-exem pt, non-profit membership society . It was founded in the USA in 1973. It now has members in more than 50 countries. The Society's objective is the collection, exchange and publication of evidence tending to support and confirm the following theories: The earth received a visit from outer space in prehistoric times ... (or) The present technical civilisation on our planet is not the first ... (or) A combination Of both theories. Membership of the AAS is open to everybody. A newsletter for members is published in English and German every two months. The AAS takes part in the organisation of expedi­ tions and study journeys to archaeological and other sites of impor tance for the proof of the theory. A world congress takes place every year.
