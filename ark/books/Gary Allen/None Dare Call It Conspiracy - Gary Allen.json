Afterreading this book, you will never look at national and world events in the sameway again.None Dare Call It Conspiracy will be a very controversial book. At first it willreceive little publicity and those whose plans are exposed in it will try tokill it by the silent treatment. For reasons that become obvious as you readthis book, it will not be reviewed in all the \"proper\" places or be available onyour local bookstand. However, there is nothing these people can do to stop agrassroots book distributing system. Eventually it will be necessary for thepeople and organizations named in this book to try to blunt its effect byattacking it or the author.

Usually you are shown a landscape with trees, bushes, flowers andother bits of nature. The caption reads something like this: \"Concealedsomewhere in this picture is a donkey pulling a cart with a boy in it. Can youfind them?\" Try as you might, usually you could not find the hidden pictureuntil you turned to a page farther back in the magazine which would reveal howcleverly the artist had hidden it from us. If we study the landscape we realizethat the whole picture was painted in such a way as to conceal the real picturewithin, and once we see the \"real picture,\" it stands out like the proverbialpainful digit.We believe the picture painters of the mass media are artfully creatinglandscapes for us which deliberately hide the real picture. In this book we willshow you how to discover the \"hidden picture\" in the landscapes presented to usdaily through newspapers, radio and television. Once you can see through thecamouflage, you will see the donkey, the cart and the boy who have been thereall along.Millions of Americans are concerned and frustrated over mishappenings in ournation. They feel that something is wrong, drastically wrong, but because of thepicture painters they can't quite put their fingers on it.Maybe you are one of those persons. Something is bugging you, but you aren'tsure what. We keep electing new Presidents who seemingly promise faithfully tohalt the worldwide Communist advance, put the blocks to extravagant governmentspending, douse the tea of inflation, put the economy on an even keel, reversethe trend which is turning the country into a moral sewer, and toss thecriminals into the hoosegow where they belong. Yet despite high hopes andglittering campaign promise these problems continue to worsen no matter who isin office. Each new administration, whether it be Republican or Democrat,continues the same basic policies of the previous administration which it had sothoroughly denounced during the election campaign. It is considered poor form tomention this, but it is true nonetheless. Is there a plausible reason to explainwhy this happens? We are not supposed to think so. We are supposed to think itis all accidental and coincidental and that therefore there is nothing we can doabout it.FDR once said \"In politics, nothing happens by accident. If it happens, you canbet it was planned that way.\" He was in a good position to know. We believe thatmany of the major world events that are shaping our destinies occur becausesomebody or somebodies have planned them that way. If we were merely dealingwith the law of averages, half of the events affecting our nation's well-beingshould be good for America. If we were dealing with mere incompetence, ourleaders should occasionally make a mistake in our favor. We shall attempt toprove that we are not really dealing with coincidence or stupidity, but withplanning and brilliance. This small book deals with that planning and brillianceand how it has shaped the foreign and domestic policies of the last sixadministrations. We hope it will explain matters which have up to now seemedinexplicable; that it will bring into sharp focus images which have beenobscured by the landscape painters of the mass media.Those who believe that major world events result from planning are laughed atfor believing in the \"conspiracy theory of history.\" Of course, no one in thismodern day and age really believes in the conspiracy theory of history - exceptthose who have taken the time to study the subject. When you think about it,there are really only two theories of history. Either things happen by accidentneither planned nor caused by anybody, or they happen because they are plannedand somebody causes them to happen. In reality, it is the accidental theory ofhistory preached in the unhallowed Halls of Ivy which should be ridiculed.Otherwise, why does every recent administration make the same mistakes as theprevious ones? Why do they repeat the errors of the past which produceinflation, depressions and war? Why does our State Department \"stumble\" from oneCommunist-aiding \"blunder\" to another? If you believe it is all an accident orthe result of mysterious and unexplainable tides of history, you will beregarded as an \"intellectual\" who understands that we live in a complex world.If you believe that something like 32,496 consecutive coincidences over the pastforty years stretches the law of averages a bit, you are a kook!Why is it that virtually all \"reputable\" scholars and mass media columnists andcommentators reject the cause and effect or conspiratorial theory of history?Primarily, most scholars follow the crowd in the academic world just as mostwomen follow fashions. To buck the tide means social and professional ostracism.The same is true of the mass media. While professors and pontificators professto be tolerant and broadminded, in practice it's strictly a one way street -with all traffic flowing left. A Maoist can be tolerated by Liberals of IvoryTowerland or by the Establishment's media pundits, but to be a conservative, anda conservative who propounds a conspiratorial view, is absolutely verboten.Better you should be a drunk at a national WCTU convention!Secondly, these people have over the years acquired a strong vested emotionalinterest in their own errors. Their intellects and egos are totally committed tothe accidental theory. Most people are highly reluctant to admit that they havebeen conned or have shown poor judgment. To inspect the evidence of theexistence of a conspiracy guiding our political destiny from behind the sceneswould force many of these people to repudiate a lifetime of accumulatedopinions. It takes a person with strong character indeed to face the facts andadmit he has been wrong even if it was because he was uninformed.Such was the case with the author of this book. It was only because he set outto prove the conservative anti-Communists wrong that he happened to end upwriting this book. His initial reaction to the conservative point of view wasone of suspicion and hostility; and it was only after many months of intensiveresearch that he had to admit that he had been \"conned.\"Politicians and \"intellectuals\" are attracted to the concept that events arepropelled by some mysterious tide of history or happen by accident. By thisreasoning they hope to escape the blame when things go wrong.Most intellectuals, pseudo and otherwise, deal with the conspiratorial theory ofhistory simply by ignoring it. They never attempt to refute the evidence. Itcan't be refuted. If and when the silent treatment doesn't work, these\"objective\" scholars and mass media opinion molders resort to personal attacks,ridicule and satire. The personal attacks tend to divert attention from thefacts which an author or speaker is trying to expose. The idea is to force theperson exposing the conspiracy to stop the exposure and spend his time andeffort defending himself.However, the most effective weapons used against the conspiratorial theory ofhistory are ridicule and satire. These extremely potent weapons can be cleverlyused to avoid any honest attempt at refuting the facts. After all, nobody likesto be made fun of. Rather than be ridiculed most people will keep quiet; and,this subject certainly does lend itself to ridicule and satire. One techniquewhich can be used is to expand the conspiracy to the extent it becomes absurd.For instance, our man from the Halls of Poison Ivy might say in a scoffingarrogant tone, \"I suppose you believe every liberal professor gets a telegrameach morning from conspiracy headquarters containing his orders for the day'sbrainwashing of his students?\" Some conspiratorialists do indeed overdraw thepicture by expanding the conspiracy (from the small clique which it is) toinclude every local knee jerk liberal activist and government bureaucrat. Or,because of racial or religious bigotry, they will take small fragments oflegitimate evidence and expand them into a conclusion that will support theirparticular prejudice, i.e., the conspiracy is totally \"Jewish,\" \"Catholic,\" or\"Masonic\". These people do not help to expose the conspiracy, but, sadly playinto the hands of those who want the public to believe that allconspiratorialists are screwballs.\"Intellectuals\" are fond of mouthing clichÃ©s like \"The conspiracy theory isoften tempting. However, it is overly simplistic.\" To ascribe absolutelyeverything that happens to the machinations of a small group of power hungryconspirators is overly simplistic. But, in our opinion nothing is moresimplistic than doggedly holding onto the accidental view of major world events.In most cases Liberals simply accuse all those who discuss the conspiracy ofbeing paranoid. \"Ah, you right wingers,\" they say, \"rustling every bush, kickingover every rock, looking for imaginary boogeymen.\" Then comes the coup degraceâlabeling the conspiratorial theory as the \"devil theory of history.\" TheLiberals love that one. Even though it is an empty phrase, it sounds sosophisticated!With the leaders of the academic and communications world assuming this sneeringattitude towards the conspiratorial (or cause and effect) theory of history, itis not surprising that millions of innocent and well-meaning people, in anatural desire not to appear naive, assume the attitudes and repeat the clichÃ©sof the opinion makers. These persons, in their attempt to appear sophisticated,assume their mentors' air of smug superiority even though they themselves havenot spent five minutes in study on the subject of international conspiracy.The \"accidentalists\" would have us believe that ascribing any of our problems toplanning is \"simplistic\" and all our problems are caused by Poverty, Ignoranceand Disease - hereinafter abbreviated as PID. They ignore the fact thatorganized conspirators use PID, real and imagined, as an excuse to build a jailfor us all. Most of the world has been in PID since time immemorial and it takesincredibly superficial thinking to ascribe the ricocheting of the United Statesgovernment from one disaster to another over the past thirty years to PID.\"Accidentalists\" ignore the fact that some of the more advanced nations in theworld have been captured by Communists. Czechoslovakia was one of the world'smost modern industrial nations and Cuba had the second highest per capita incomeof any nation in Central and South America.It is not true, however, to state that there are no members of the intellectualelite who subscribe to the conspiratorial theory of history. For example, thereis Professor Carroll Quigley of the Foreign Service School at GeorgetownUniversity. Professor Quigley can hardly be accused of being a \"right wingextremist.\" (Those three words have been made inseparable by the mass media.)Dr. Quigley has all the \"liberal\" credentials, having taught at the LiberalEstablishment's academic Meccas of Princeton and Harvard. In his 1350-page, 5pound tome Tragedy and Hope, Dr. Quigley reveals the existence of theconspiratorial network which will be discussed in this book. The Professor isnot merely formulating a theory, but revealing this network's existence fromfirsthand experience. He also makes it clear that it is only the network'ssecrecy and not their goals to which he objects. Professor Quigley discloses:\"I know of the operations of this network because I have studied it for twentyyears and was permitted for two years, in the early 1960's, to examine itspapers and secret records. I HAVE NO AVERSION TO IT OR TO MOST OF ITS AIMS ANDHAVE, FOR MUCH OF MY LIFE, BEEN CLOSE TO IT AND TO MANY OF ITS INSTRUMENTS. Ihave objected, both in the past and recently, to a few of its policiesâ¦but ingeneral my chief difference of opinion is that IT WISHES TO REMAIN UNKNOWN, andI believe its role in history is significant enough to be known.\" (Emphasisadded)We agree, its role in history does deserve to be known. That is why we havewritten this book. However, we most emphatically disagree with this network'saim which the Professor describes as \"nothing less than to create a world systemof financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system ofeach country and the economy of the world as a whole.\" In other words, thispower mad clique wants to control and rule the world. Even more frightening,they want total control over all individual actions. As Professor Quigleyobserves: \"â¦ his [the individual's] freedom and choice will be controlled withinvery narrow alternatives by the fact that he will be numbered from birth andfollowed, as a number, through his educational training, his required militaryor other public service, his tax contributions, his health and medicalrequirements, and his final retirement and death benefits.\" It wants controlover all natural resources, business, banking and transportation by controllingthe governments of the world. In order to accomplish these aims the conspiratorshave had no qualms about fomenting wars, depressions and hatred. They want amonopoly which would eliminate all competitors and destroy the free enterprisesystem. And Professor Quigley, of Harvard, Princeton and Georgetown approves!Professor Quigley is not the only academic who is aware of the existence of aclique of self-perpetuating conspirators whom we shall call Insiders. Otherhonest scholars finding the same individuals at the scenes of disastrouspolitical fires over and over again have concluded that there is obviously anorganization of pyromaniacs at work in the world. But these intellectuallyhonest scholars realize that if they challenged the Insiders head-on, theircareers would be destroyed. The author knows these men exist because he has beenin contact with some of them.There are also religious leaders who are aware of the existence of thisconspiracy. In a UPI story dated December 27, 1965, Father Pedro Arrupe, head ofthe Jesuit Order of the Roman Catholic Church, made the following charges duringhis remarks to the Ecumenical Council:\"Thisâ¦Godless society operates in an extremely efficient manner at least in itshigher levels of leadership. It makes use of every possible means at itsdisposal, be they scientific, technical, social or economic.It follows a perfectly mapped-out strategy. It holds almost complete sway ininternational organizations, in financial circles, in the field of masscommunications; press, cinema, radio and television.\"There are a number of problems to be overcome in convincing a person of thepossible existence of a conspiratorial clique of Insiders who from the veryhighest levels manipulate government policy. In this case truth is reallystranger than fiction. We are dealing with history's greatest \"whodunit,\" amystery thriller which puts Erle Stanley Gardner to shame. If you love amystery, you'll be fascinated with the study of the operations of the Insiders.If you do study this network of which Professor Quigley speaks, you will findthat what had at first seemed incredible not only exists, but heavily influencesour lives.It must be remembered that the first job of any conspiracy, whether it be inpolitics, crime or within a business office, is to convince everyone else thatno conspiracy exists. The conspiratorsâ success will be determined largely bytheir ability to do this. That the elite of the academic world and masscommunications media always pooh-pooh the existence of the Insiders merelyserves to camouflage their operations. These \"artists\" hide the boy, the cartand the donkey.Probably at some time you have been involved with or had personal knowledge ofsome event which was reported in the news. Perhaps it concerned an athleticevent, an election, a committee or your business. Did the report contain the\"real\" story, the story behind the story? Probably not, and for a variety ofreasons. The reporter had time and space problems and there is a good chance thepersons involved deliberately did not reveal all the facts. Possibly thereporter's own prejudices governed what facts went into the story and which weredeleted. Our point is that most people know from personal experience that a newsstory often is not the whole story. But many of us assume that our own case isunique when really it is typical. What is true about the reporting of localevents is equally as true about the reporting of national and internationalevents.Psychological problems are also involved in inducing people to look at theevidence concerning the Insiders. People are usually comfortable with their oldbeliefs and conceptions. When Columbus told people the world was a ball and nota pancake, they were highly upset. They were being asked to reject their way ofthinking of a lifetime and adopt a whole new outlook. The \"intellectuals\" of theday scoffed at Columbus and people were afraid they would lose social prestigeif they listened to him. Many others just did not want to believe the world wasround. It complicated too many things. And typical flat-earthers had such avested interest involving their own egos, that they heaped abuse on Columbus forchallenging their view of the universe. âDon't confuse us with facts; our mindsare made up,\" they said.These same factors apply today. Because the Establishment controls the media,anyone exposing the Insiders will be the recipient of a continuous fusillade ofinvective from newspapers, magazines, TV and radio. In this manner one isthreatened with loss of \"social respectability\" if he dares broach the idea thatthere is organization behind any of the problems currently wracking America.Unfortunately, for many people social status comes before intellectual honesty.Although they would never admit it social position is more important to manypeople than is the survival of freedom in America.If you ask these people which is more important - social respectability orsaving their children from slavery - they will tell you the latter, of course.But their actions (or lack of same) speak so much louder than their words.People have an infinite capacity for rationalization when it comes to refusingto face the threat to America's survival. Deep down these people are afraid theymay be laughed at if they take a stand, or may be denied an invitation to somesocial climber's cocktail party. Instead of getting mad at the Insiders, thesepeople actually get angry at these who are trying to save the country byexposing the conspirators.One thing which makes it so hard for some socially minded people to assess theconspiratorial evidence objectively is that the conspirators come from the veryhighest social strata. They are immensely wealthy, highly educated and extremelycultured. Many of them have lifelong reputations for philanthropy. Nobody enjoysbeing put in the position of accusing prominent people of conspiring to enslavetheir fellow Americans, but the facts are inescapable. Many business andprofessional people are particularly vulnerable to the \"don't jeopardize yoursocial respectability\" pitch given by those who don't want the conspiracyexposed. The Insiders know that if the business and professional community willnot take a stand to save the private enterprise system, the socialism throughwhich they intend to control the world will be inevitable. They believe thatmost business and professional men are too shallow and decadent, too statusconscious, too tied up in the problems of their jobs and businesses to worryabout what is going on in politics. These men are told that it might be bad forbusiness or jeopardize their government contracts if they take a stand. Theyhave been bribed into silence with their own tax monies!We are hoping that the conspirators have underestimated the courage andpatriotism remaining in the American people. We feel there are a sufficientnumber of you who are not mesmerized by the television set, who put God, familyand country above social status, who will band together to expose and destroythe conspiracy of the Insiders. The philosopher Diogenes scoured the length andbreadth of ancient Greece searching for an honest man. We are scouring thelength and breadth of America in search of hundreds of thousands ofintellectually honest men and women who are willing to investigate facts andcome to logical conclusions - no matter how unpleasant those conclusions may be. "},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2SOCIALISM â ROYAL ROAD TO POWER FOR THE SUPER-RICH Everyone knows that Adolph Hitler existed. No one disputes that. The terror anddestruction that this madman inflicted upon the world are universallyrecognized. Hitler came from a poor family which had absolutely no socialposition. He was a high school drop-out and nobody ever accused him of beingcultured. Yet this man tried to conquer the world. During his early career hesat in a cold garret and poured onto paper his ambitions to rule the world. Weknow that.Similarly, we know that a man named Vladimir Ilich Lenin also existed. LikeHitler, Lenin did not spring from a family of social lions. The son of a pettybureaucrat, Lenin, who spent most of his adult life in poverty, has beenresponsible for the deaths of tens of millions of your fellow human beings andthe enslavement of nearly a billion more. Like Hitler, Lenin sat up nights in adank garret scheming how he could conquer the world. We know that too.Is it not theoretically possible that a billionaire could be sitting, not in agarret, but in a penthouse, in Manhattan, London or Paris and dream the samedream as Lenin and Hitler? You will have to admit it is theoretically possible.Julius Caesar, a wealthy aristocrat, did. And such a man might form an allianceor association with other like-minded men, might he not? Caesar did. These menwould be superbly educated, command immense social prestige and be able to poolastonishing amounts of money to carry out their purposes. These are advantagesthat Hitler and Lenin did not have.It is difficult for the average individual to fathom such perverted lust forpower. The typical person, of whatever nationality, wants only to enjoy successin his job, to be able to afford a reasonably high standard of living completewith leisure and travel. He wants to provide for his family in sickness and inhealth and to give his children a sound education. His ambition stops there. Hehas no desire to exercise power over others, to conquer other lands or peoples,to be a king. He wants to mind his own business and enjoy life. Since he has nolust for power, it is difficult for him to imagine that there are others whohaveâ¦others who march to a far different drum. But we must realize that therehave been Hitlers and Lenins and Stalins and Caesars and Alexander the Greatsthroughout history. Why should we assume there are no such men today withperverted lusts for power? And if these men happen to be billionaires is it notpossible that they would use men like Hitler and Lenin as pawns to seize powerfor themselves?Indeed, difficult as this is to believe, such is the case. Like Columbus, we arefaced with the task of convincing you that the world is not flat, as you havebeen led to believe all your life, but, instead, is round. We are going topresent evidence that what you call \"Communism\" is not run from Moscow orPeking, but is an arm of a bigger conspiracy run from New York, London andParis. The men at the apex of this movement are not Communists in thetraditional sense of that term. They feel no loyalty to Moscow or Peking. Theyare loyal only to themselves and their undertaking. And these men certainly donot believe in the clap-trap pseudo-philosophy of Communism. They have nointention of dividing their wealth. Socialism is a philosophy which conspiratorsexploit, but in which only the naive believe. Just how finance capitalism isused as the anvil and Communism as the hammer to conquer the world will beexplained in this book.The concept that Communism is but an arm of a larger conspiracy has becomeincreasingly apparent throughout the author's journalistic investigations. Hehas had the opportunity to interview privately four retired officers who spenttheir careers high in military intelligence. Much of what the author knows helearned from them. And the story is known to several thousand others. Highmilitary intelligence circles are well aware of this network. In addition, theauthor has interviewed six men who have spent considerable time as investigatorsfor Congressional committees. In 1953, one of these men, Norman Dodd, headed theReece Committee's investigation of tax-free foundations. When Mr. Dodd begandelving into the role of international high finance in the world revolutionarymovement, the investigation was killed on orders from the Eisenhower occupiedWhite House. According to Mr. Dodd, it is permissible to investigate the radicalbomb throwers in the streets, but when you begin to trace their activities backto their origins in the \"legitimate world,\" the political iron curtain slamsdown.You can believe anything you want about Communism except that it is a conspiracyrun by men from the respectable world. People will often say to an activeanti-Communist: \"I can understand your concern with Communism, but the idea thata Communist conspiracy is making great inroads in the United States is absurd.The American people are anti-Communist. They're not about to buy Communism. It'sunderstandable to be concerned about Communism in Africa or Asia or SouthAmerica with their tremendous poverty, ignorance and disease. But to beconcerned about Communism in the United States where the vast majority of peoplehave no sympathy with it whatsoever is a misspent concern.\"On the face of it, that is a very logical and plausible argument. The Americanpeople are indeed anti-Communist. Suppose you were to lay this book down rightnow, pick up a clipboard and head for the nearest shopping center to conduct asurvey on Americans' attitudes about Communism. \"Sir,\" you say to the firstprospect you encounter, \"we would like to know if you are for or againstCommunism?\"Most people would probably think you were putting them on. If we stick to oursurvey we would find that ninety-nine percent of the people are anti-Communist.We probably would be hard put to find anybody who would take an affirmativestand for Communism.So, on the surface it appears that the charges made against anti-Communistsconcerned with the internal threat of Communism are valid. The American peopleare not pro-Communist. But before our imaginary interviewee walks away indisgust with what he believes is a hokey survey, you add: \"Sir, before you leavethere are a couple of other questions I would like to ask. You won't find thesequite so insulting or ludicrous.\" Your next question is: \"What is Communism?Will you define it, please?\"Immediately a whole new situation has developed. Rather than the near unanimitypreviously found, we now have an incredible diversity of ideas. There are amultitude of opinions on what Communism is. Some will say: \"Oh, yes, Communism.Well, that's a tyrannical brand of socialism.\" Others will maintain \"Communismas it was originally intended by Karl Marx was a good idea. But it has neverbeen practiced and the Russians have loused it up.\" A more erudite type mightproclaim: \"Communism is simply a rebirth of Russian imperialism.\"If per chance one of the men you ask to define Communism happened to be apolitical science professor from the local college, he might well reply: \"Youcan't ask 'what is Communism?' That is a totally simplistic question about anextremely complex situation. Communism today, quite unlike the view held by theright wing extremists in America, is not an international monolithic movement.Rather, it is a polycentric, fragmented, nationalistic movement deriving itscharacter through the charismas of its various national leaders. While, ofcourse, there is the welding of Hegelian dialectics with Feuerbachianmaterialism held in common by the Communist parties generally, it is amonumental oversimplification to ask 'what is Communism?' Instead you shouldask: \"What is the Communism of Mao Tse-tung? What is the Communism of the lateHo Chi Minh, or Fidel Castro or Marshal Tito?\"If you think we are being facetious here, you haven't talked to a politicalscience professor lately. For the above is the prevailing view on our campuses,not to mention in our State Department.Whether you agree or disagree with any of these definitions, or, as may well bethe case, you have one of your own, one thing is undeniable. No appreciablesegment of the anti-Communist American public can agree on just what it is thatthey are against. Isn't that frightening? Here we have something that almosteverybody agrees is bad, but we cannot agree on just what it is we are against.How would this work in a football game, for example? Can you imagine howeffective the defense of a football team would be if the front four could notagree with the linebackers who could not agree with the corner backs who couldnot agree with the safety men who could not agree with the assistant coaches whocould not agree with the head coach as to what kind of defense they should putup against the offense being presented? The obvious result would be chaos. Youcould take a sand lot team and successfully pit them against the Green BayPackers if the Packers couldn't agree on what it is they are opposing. That isacademic. The first principle in any encounter, whether it be football or war(hot or cold), is: Know your enemy. The American people do not know their enemy.Consequently, it is not strange at all that for three decades we have beenwatching one country of the world after another fall behind the Communistcurtain.In keeping with the fact that almost everybody seems to have his own definitionof Communism, we are going to give you ours, and then we will attempt to proveto you that it is the only valid one. Communism: AN INTERNATIONAL,CONSPIRATORIAL DRIVE FOR POWER ON THE PART OF MEN IN HIGH PLACES WILLING TO USEANY MEANS TO BRING ABOUT THEIR DESIRED AIMâGLOBAL CONQUEST.You will notice that we did not mention Marx, Engels, Lenin, Trotsky, bourgeois,proletariat or dialectical materialism. We said nothing of the pseudo-economicsor political philosophy of the Communists. These are the TECHNIQUES of Communismand should not be confused with the Communist conspiracy itself. We did call itan international conspiratorial drive for power. Unless we understand theconspiratorial nature of Communism, we don't understand it at all. We will beeternally fixated at the Gus Hall level of Communism. And that's not where it'sat, baby!The way to bring down the wrath of the Liberal press Establishment or theprofessional Liberals is simply to use the word conspiracy in relation toCommunism. We are not supposed to believe that Communism is a politicalconspiracy. We can believe anything else we wish to about it. We can believethat it is brutal, tyrannical, evil or even that it intends to bury us, and wewill win the plaudits of the vast majority of American people. But don't ever,ever use the word conspiracy if you expect applause, for that is when the wrathof Liberaldom will be unleashed against you. We are not disallowed frombelieving in all types of conspiracy, just modern political conspiracy.We know that down through the annals of history small groups of men have existedwho have conspired to bring the reins of power into their hands. History booksare full of their schemes. Even Life magazine believes in conspiracies like theCosa Nostra where men conspire to make money through crime. You may recall thatLife did a series of articles on the testimony of Joseph Valachi before theMcClellan Committee several years ago. There are some aspects of thoserevelations which are worth noting.Most of us did not know the organization was called Cosa Nostra. Until Valachi\"sang\" we all thought it was named the Mafia. That is how little we knew aboutthis group, despite the fact that it was a century old and had been operating inmany countries with a self-perpetuating clique of leaders. We didn't even knowit by its proper name. It is not possible a political conspiracy might exist,waiting for a Joseph Valachi to testify? Is Dr. Carroll Quigley the JosephValachi of political conspiracies?We see that everybody, even Life magazine, believes in some sort of conspiracy.The question is: Which is the more lethal form of conspiracy criminal orpolitical? And what is the difference between a member of the Cosa Nostra and aCommunist, or more properly, an Insider conspirator? Men like Lucky Luciano whohave scratched and clawed to the top of the heap in organized crime must, ofnecessity, be diabolically brilliant, cunning and absolutely ruthless. But,almost without exception, the men in the hierarchy of organized crime have hadno formal education. They were born into poverty and learned their trade in theback alleys of Naples, New York or Chicago.Now suppose someone with this same amoral grasping personality were born into apatrician family of great wealth and was educated at the best prep schools, thenHarvard, Yale or Princeton, followed by graduate work possibly at Oxford. Inthese institutions he would become totally familiar with history, economics,psychology, sociology and political science. After having graduated from suchillustrious establishments of higher learning, are we likely to find him out onthe streets peddling fifty cent tickets to a numbers game? Would you find himpushing marijuana to high schoolers or running a string of houses ofprostitution? Would he be getting involved in gangland killings? Not at all. Forwith that sort of education, this person would realize that if one wants power,real power, the lessons of history say, \"Get into the government business.\"Become a politician and work for political power or, better yet, get somepoliticians to front for you. That is where the real powerâand the realmoneyâis.Conspiracy to seize the power of government is as old as government itself. Wecan study the conspiracies surrounding Alcibiades in Greece or Julius Caesar inAncient Rome, but we are not supposed to think that men today scheme to achievepolitical power.Every conspirator has two things in common with every other conspirator. He mustbe an accomplished liar and a farseeing planner. Whether you are studyingHitler, Alcibiades, Julius Caesar or some of our contemporary conspirators, youwill find that their patient planning is almost overwhelming. We repeat FDR'sstatement: \"In politics, nothing happens by accident. If it happens, you can betit was planned that way.\"In reality, Communism is a tyranny planned by power seekers whose most effectiveweapon is the big lie. And if one takes all the lies of Communism and boils themdown, you will find they distill into two major lies out of which all othersspring. They are: (1) Communism is inevitable, and (2) Communism is a movementof the downtrodden masses rising up against exploiting bosses.Let us go back to our imaginary survey and analyze our first big lie ofCommunismâthat it is inevitable. You will recall that we asked our intervieweeif he was for or against Communism and then we asked him to define it. Now weare going to ask him: \"Sir, do you think Communism is inevitable in America?\"And in almost every case the response will be something like this: \"Oh, well,no. I don't think so. You know how Americans are. We are a little slow sometimesin reacting to danger. You remember Pearl Harbor. But the American people wouldnever sit still for Communism.\"Next we ask: \"Well then, do you think socialism is inevitable in America?\" Theanswer, in almost every case will be similar to this: \"'I'm no socialist, youunderstand, but I see what is going on in this country. Yeah, I'd have to saythat socialism is inevitable.\"Then we ask our interviewee: \"Since you say you are not a socialist but you feelthe country is being socialized, why don't you do something about it?\" Hisresponse will rim: \"I'm only one person. Besides it's inevitable. You can'tfight city hall, heh, heh, heh.\"Don't you know that the boys down at city hall are doing everything they can toconvince you of that? How effectively can you oppose anything if you feel youropposition is futile? Giving your opponent the idea that defending himself isfutile is as old as warfare itself. In about 500 BC the Chinesewarlord-philosopher Sun Tsu stated, \"Supreme excellence in warfare lies in thedestruction of your enemy's will to resist in advance of perceptiblehostilities.\" We call it \"psy war\" or psychological warfare today. In poker, itis called \"running a good bluff.\" The principle is the same.Thus we have the American people: anti-Communist, but unable to define it andanti-Socialist, but thinking it is inevitable. How did Marx view Communism? Howimportant is \"the inevitability of Communism\" to the Communists? What do theCommunists want you to believe is inevitable Communism or socialism? If youstudy Marx' Communist Manifesto you will find that in essence Marx said theproletarian revolution would establish the SOCIALIST dictatorship of theproletariat. To achieve the SOCIALIST dictatorship of the proletariat, threethings would have to be accomplished: (1) The elimination of all right toprivate property; (2) The dissolution of the family unit; and (3) Destruction ofwhat Marx referred to as the \"opiate of the people,\" religion.Marx went on to state that when the dictatorship of the proletariat hadaccomplished these three things throughout the world, and after someundetermined length of time (as you can imagine, he was very vague on thispoint), the all-powerful state would miraculously wither away and statesocialism would give way to Communism. You wouldn't need any government at all.Everything would be peace, sweetness and light and everybody would live happilyever after. But first, all Communists must work to establish SOCIALISM. Can'tyou just see Karl Marx really believing that an omnipotent state would witheraway? Or can you imagine that a Joseph Stalin (or any other man with the cunningand ruthlessness necessary to rise to the top of the heap in an all-powerfuldictatorship) would voluntarily dismantle the power he had built by fear andterror?* [../images/00001.jpeg]*Karl Marx was hired by a mysterious group who calledthemselves the League of Just Men to write the Communist Manifesto as demagogicboob-bait to appeal to the mob. In actual fact the Communist Manifesto was incirculation for many years before Marx' name was widely enough recognized toestablish his authorship for this revolutionary handbook. All Karl Marx reallydid was to update and codify the very same revolutionary plans and principlesset down seventy years earlier by Adam Weishaupt, the founder of the Order ofIlluminati in Bavaria. And, it is widely acknowledged by serious scholars ofthis subject that the League of Just Men was simply an extension of theIlluminati which was forced to go deep underground after it was exposed by araid in 1786 conducted by the Bavarian authorities.Socialism would be the bait... the excuse to establish the dictatorship. Sincedictatorship is hard to sell in idealistic terms, the idea had to be added thatthe dictatorship was just a temporary necessity and would soon dissolve of itsown accord. You really have to be naive to swallow that, but millions do!The drive to establish SOCIALISM, not Communism, is at the core of everythingthe Communists and the Insiders do. Marx and all of his successors in theCommunist movement have ordered their followers to work on building SOCIALISM.If you go to hear an official Communist speaker, he never mentions Communism. Hewill speak only of the struggle to complete the socialization of America. If yougo to a Communist bookstore you will find that all of their literature pushesthis theme. It does not call for the establishment of Communism, but SOCIALISM.And many members of the Establishment push this same theme. The September 1970issue of New York magazine contains an article by Harvard Professor John KennethGalbraith, himself a professed socialist, entitled \"Richard Nixon and the GreatSocialist Revival.\" In describing what he calls the \"Nixon Game Plan,\" Galbraithstates:\"Mr. Nixon is probably not a great reader of Marx, but [his advisors] Drs.Burns, Shultz and McCracken are excellent scholars who know him well and couldhave brought the President abreast and it is beyond denying that the crisis thataided the rush into socialism was engineered by the Administrationâ¦\"Dr. Galbraith began his article by stating:\"Certainly the least predicted development under the Nixon Administration wasthis great new thrust to socialism. One encounters people who still aren't awareof it. Others must be rubbing their eyes, for certainly the portents seemed allto the contrary. As an opponent of socialism, Mr. Nixon seemed steadfastâ¦\"Galbraith then proceeds to list the giant steps toward socialism taken by theNixon Administration. The conclusion one draws from the article is thatsocialism, whether it be from the Democrat or Republican Parties, is inevitable.Fellow Harvard socialist Dr. Arthur Schlesinger has said much the same thing:\"The chief liberal gains in the past generally remain on the statute books whenthe conservatives recover powerâ¦ liberalism grows constantly more liberal, andby the same token, conservatism grows constantly less conservativeâ¦\"Many extremely patriotic individuals have innocently fallen for the conspiracy'sline. Walter Trohan, columnist emeritus for the Chicago Tribune and one ofAmerica's outstanding political commentators, has accurately noted:\"It is a known fact that the policies of the government today, whetherRepublican or Democratic, are closer to the 1932 platform of the Communist Partythan they are to either of their own party platforms in that critical year. Morethan 100 years ago, in 1848 to be exact, Karl Marx promulgated his program forthe socialized state in the Communist Manifestoâ¦\"And Mr. Trohan has also been led to believe that the trend is inevitable:\"Conservatives should be realistic enough to recognize that this country isgoing deeper into socialism and will see expansion of federal power, whetherRepublicans or Democrats are in power. The only comfort they may have is thatthe pace will be slower under Richard M. Nixon than it might have been underHubert H. Humphreyâ¦Conservatives are going to have to recognize that the Nixon Administration willembrace most of the socialism of the Democratic administrations, whileprofessing to improve itâ¦\"The Establishment promotes the idea of the inevitability of Communism throughits perversion of terms used in describing the political spectrum. (See Chart 1)We are told that on the far Left of the political spectrum we find Communism,which is admittedly dictatorial. But, we are also told that equally to be fearedis the opposite of the far Left, i.e., the far Right, which is labeled Fascism.We are constantly told that we should all try to stay in the middle of the road,which is termed democracy, but by which the Establishment means Fabian (orcreeping) socialism. (The fact that the middle of the road has been movinginexorably leftward for forty years is ignored.) Here is an excellent example ofthe use of false alternatives. We are given the choice between Communism(international socialism) on one end of the spectrum Nazism (national socialism)on the other end, or Fabian socialism in the middle. The whole spectrum issocialist!This is absurd. Where would you put an anarchist on this spectrum? Where do youput a person who believes in a Constitutional Republic and the free enterprisesystem? He is not represented here, yet this spectrum is used for politicaldefinitions by a probable ninety percent of the people of the nation.There is an accurate political spectrum. (See Chart 2) Communism is, bydefinition, total government. If you have total government it makes littledifference whether you call it Communism, Fascism, Socialism, Caesarism orPharaohism. It's all pretty much the same from the standpoint of the people whomust live and suffer under it. If total government (by any of its pseudonyms)stands on the far Left, then by logic the far Right should represent anarchy, orno government.[../images/00002.jpeg]Chart 1 depicts a false Left-Right political spectrum used by Liberals which hasCommunism (International Socialism) on the far Left and its twin, Fascism(National Socialism) on the far Right with the \"middle of the road\" being FabianSocialism. The entire spectrum is Socialist!Chart 2 is a more rational political spectrum with total government in any formon the far Left and no government or anarchy on the far right. The U. S. was aRepublic with a limited government, but for the past 60 years we have beenmoving leftward across the spectrum towards total government with each new pieceof socialist legislation.[../images/00003.jpeg]Fabian Society emblem[../images/00004.jpeg]Anarchists' symbol Our Founding Fathers revolted against the near-total government of the Englishmonarchy. But they knew that having no government at all would lead to chaos. Sothey set up a Constitutional Republic with a very limited government. They knewthat men prospered in freedom. Although the free enterprise system is notmentioned specifically in the Constitution, it is the only one which can existunder a Constitutional Republic. All collectivist systems require power ingovernment which the Constitution did not grant. Our Founding Fathers had nointention of allowing the government to become an instrument to steal the fruitof one man's labor and give it to another who had not earned it. Our governmentwas to be one of severely limited powers. Thomas Jefferson said: \"In questionsof power then let no more be heard of confidence in man, but bind him down frommischief by the chains of the Constitution.\" Jefferson knew that if thegovernment were not enslaved, people soon would be.It was Jefferson's view that government governs best which governs least. Ourforefathers established this country with the very least possible amount ofgovernment. Although they lived in an age before automobiles, electric lightsand television, they understood human nature and its relation to politicalsystems far better than do most Americans today. Times change, technologychanges, but principles are eternal. Primarily, government was to provide fornational defense and to establish a court system. But we have burst the chainsthat Jefferson spoke of and for many years now we have been moving leftwardacross the political spectrum toward collectivist total government. Everyproposal by our political leaders (including some which are supposed to have thevery opposite effect, such as Nixon's revenue sharing proposal) carries usfurther leftward to centralized government. This is not because socialism isinevitable. It is no more inevitable than Pharaohism. It is largely the resultof clever planning and patient gradualism.Since all Communists and their Insider bosses are waging a constant struggle forSOCIALISM, let us define that term. Socialism is usually defined as governmentownership and/or control over the basic means of production and distribution ofgoods and services. When analyzed this means government control over everything,including you. All controls are \"people\" controls. If the government controlsthese areas it can eventually do just exactly as Marx set out to doâdestroy theright to private property, eliminate the family and wipe out religion.We are being socialized in America and everybody knows it. If we had a chance tosit down and have a cup of coffee with the man in the street that we have beeninterviewing, he might say: \"You know, the one thing I can never figure out iswhy all these very, very wealthy people like the Kennedys, the Fords, theRockefellers and others are for socialism. Why are the super-rich for socialism?Don't they have the most to lose? I take a look at my bank account and compareit with Nelson Rockefeller's and it seems funny that I'm against socialism andhe's out promoting it.\" Or is it funny? In reality, there is a vast differencebetween what the promoters define as socialism and what it is in actualpractice. The idea that socialism is a share-the-wealth program is strictly aconfidence game to get the people to surrender their freedom to an all-powerfulcollectivist government. While the Insiders tell us we are building a paradiseon earth, we are actually constructing a jail for ourselves.Doesn't it strike you as strange that some of the individuals pushing hardestfor socialism have their own personal wealth protected in family trusts andtax-free foundations? Men like Rockefeller, Ford and Kennedy are for everysocialist program known to man which will increase your taxes. Yet they paylittle, if anything, in taxes themselves. An article published by the NorthAmerican Newspaper Alliance in August of 1967 tells how the Rockefellers paypractically no income taxes despite their vast wealth. The article reveals thatone of the Rockefellers paid the grand total of $685 personal income tax duringa recent year.The Kennedys have their Chicago Merchandise Mart, their mansions, yachts,planes, etc., all owned by their myriads of family foundations and trusts. Taxesare for peons! Yet hypocrites like Rockefeller, Ford and Kennedy pose as greatchampions of the \"downtrodden.\" If they were really concerned about the poor,rather than using socialism as a means of achieving personal political power,they would divest themselves of their own fortunes. There is no law whichprevents them from giving away their own fortunes to the poverty stricken.Shouldn't all these men set an example? And practice what they preach? If theyadvocate sharing the wealth, shouldn't they start with their own instead of thatof the middle class which pays almost all the taxes? Why don't NelsonRockefeller and Henry Ford II give away all their wealth, retaining only enoughto place themselves at the national average? Can't you imagine Teddy Kennedygiving up his mansion, airplane and yacht and moving into a $25,000 home with a$20,000 mortgage like the rest of us?We are usually told that this clique of super-rich is socialists because theyhave a guilt complex over wealth they inherited and did not earn. Again, theycould relieve these supposed guilt complexes simply by divesting themselves oftheir unearned wealth. There are doubtless many wealthy do-gooders who have beengiven a guilt complex by their college professors, but that doesn't explain theactions of Insiders like the Rockefellers, Fords or Kennedys. All their actionsbetray them as power seekers.But the Kennedys, Rockefellers and their super-rich confederates are not beinghypocrites in advocating socialism. It appears to be a contradiction for thesuper-rich to work for socialism and the destruction of free enterprise. Inreality it is not.Our problem is that most of us believe socialism is what the socialists want usto believe it isâa share-the-wealth program. That is the theory. But is that howit works? Let us examine the only Socialist countriesâaccording to the Socialistdefinition of the wordâextant in the world today. These are the Communistcountries. The Communists themselves refer to these as Socialist countries, asin the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Here in the reality of socialism youhave a tiny oligarchical clique at the top, usually numbering no more than threepercent of the total population, controlling the total wealth, total productionand the very lives of the other ninety-seven percent. Certainly even the mostnaive observe that Mr. Brezhnev doesn't live like one of the poor peasants outon the great Russian steppes. But, according to socialist theory, he is supposedto do just that!If one understands that socialism is not a share-the-wealth program, but is inreality a method to consolidate and control the wealth, then the seeming paradoxof super-rich men promoting socialism becomes no paradox at all. Instead itbecomes the logical, even the perfect tool of power-seeking megalomaniacs.Communism, or more accurately, socialism, is not a movement of the downtroddenmasses, but of the economic elite. The plan of the conspirator Insiders then isto socialize the United States, not to Communize it.How is this to be accomplished? Chart 3 shows the structure of our government asestablished by our Founding Fathers. The Constitution fractionalized andsubdivided governmental power in every way possible. The Founding Fathersbelieved that each branch of the government, whether at the federal, state orlocal level, would be jealous of its powers and would never surrender them tocentralized control. Also, many phases of our lives (such as charity andeducation) were put totally, or almost totally, out of the grasp of politicians.Under this system you could not have a dictatorship. No segment of governmentcould possibly amass enough power to form a dictatorship. In order to have adictatorship one must have a single branch holding most of the reins of power.Once you have this, a dictatorship is inevitable. [../images/00005.jpeg]A dictatorship was impossible in our Republic because power was widely diffused.Today, as we approach Democratic Socialism, all power is being centralized atthe apex of the executive branch of the federal government. This concentrationof power makes a dictatorship inevitable. Those who control the Presidentindirectly gain virtual control of the whole country. The English philosopher Thomas Hobbes noted: \"Freedom is government divided intosmall fragments.\" Woodrow Wilson, before he became the tool of the Insiders,observed: \"This history of liberty is a history of the limitations ofgovernmental power, not the increase of it.\" And the English historian LordActon commented: \"Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corruptsabsolutely.\" Even though these men lived after our Constitution was written, ourforefathers understood these principles completely.But what is happening today? As we move leftward along the political spectrumtowards socialism, all the reins of power are being centralized in the executivebranch of the federal government. Much of this is being done by buying withlegislation or with \"free\" federal grants all the other entities. Money is usedas bait and the hook is federal control. The Supreme Court has ruled, and inthis case quite logically, that \"it is hardly lack of due process for thegovernment to regulate that which it subsidizes.\"If you and your clique wanted control over the United States, it would beimpossible to take over every city hall, county seat and state house. You wouldwant all power vested at the apex of the executive branch of the federalgovernment; then you would have only to control one man to control the wholeshebang. If you wanted to control the nation's manufacturing, commerce, finance,transportation and natural resources, you would need only to control the apex,the power pinnacle, of an all-powerful SOCIALIST government. Then you would havea monopoly and could squeeze out all your competitors. If you wanted a nationalmonopoly, you must control a national socialist government. If you want aworldwide monopoly, you must control a world socialist government. That is whatthe game is all about. \"Communism\" is not a movement of the down-trodden massesbut is a movement created, manipulated and used by power-seeking billionaires inorder to gain control over the worldâ¦first by establishing socialist governmentsin the various nations and then consolidating them all through a \"Great Merger,\"into an all-powerful world socialist super-state probably under the auspices ofthe United Nations. The balance of this book will outline just how they haveused Communism to approach that goal."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3THE MONEY MANIPULATORS Many college history professors tell their charges that the books they will beusing in the class are \"objective.\" But stop and ask yourself: Is it possible towrite a history book without a particular point of view? There are billions ofevents, which take place in the world each day. To think of writing a completehistory of a nation covering even a year is absolutely incredible.Not only is a historian's ability to write an \"objective\" history limited by thesheer volume of happenings, but by the fact that many of the most importanthappenings never appear in the papers or even in somebody's memoirs. Thedecisions reached by the \"Big Boys\" in the smoke-filled rooms are not reportedeven in the New York Times which ostensibly reports all the news that is fit toprint. (\"All the news that fits\" is a more accurate description.)In order to build his case, a historian must select a miniscule number of factsfrom the limited number that are known. If he does not have a \"theory,\" how doeshe separate important facts from unimportant ones? As Professor Stuart Crane haspointed out, this is why every book \"proves\" the author's thesis. But no book isobjective. No book can be objective; and this book is not objective. (Liberalreviewers should have a ball quoting that out of context.) The information in itis true, but the book is not objective. We have carefully selected the facts toprove our case. We believe that most other historians have focused on thelandscape, and ignored that which is most important: the cart, boy and donkey.Most of the facts which we bring out are readily verifiable at any largelibrary. But our contention is that we have arranged these facts in the orderwhich most accurately reveals their true significance in history. These are thefacts the Establishment does not want you to know.Have you ever had the experience of walking into a mystery movie two-thirds ofthe way through? Confusing wasn't it? All the evidence made it look as if thebutler was the murderer, but in the final scenes you find out, surprisingly,that it was the man's wife all along. You have to stay and see the beginning ofthe film. Then as all the pieces fall into place, the story makes sense.This situation is very similar to the one in which millions of Americans findthemselves today. They are confused by current happenings in the nation. Theyhave come in as the movie, so to speak, is going into its conclusion. Theearlier portion of the mystery is needed to make the whole thing understandable.(Actually, we are not really starting at the beginning, but we are going backfar enough to give meaning to today's happenings.)In order to understand the conspiracy it is necessary to have some rudimentaryknowledge of banking and, particularly, of international bankers. While it wouldbe an over-simplification to ascribe the entire conspiracy to internationalbankers, they nevertheless have played a key role. Think of the conspiracy as ahand with one finger labeled \"international banking,\" others \"foundations,\" \"theanti-religion movement,\" \"Fabian Socialism,\" and \"Communism.\" But it was theinternational bankers of whom Professor Quigley was speaking when we quoted himearlier as stating that their aim was nothing less than control of the worldthrough finance.Where do governments get the enormous amounts of money they need? Most, ofcourse, comes from taxation; but governments often spend more than they arewilling to tax from their citizens and so are forced to borrow. Our nationaldebt is now $455 billionâevery cent of it borrowed at interest from somewhere.The public is led to believe that our government borrows from \"the people\"through savings bonds. Actually, only the smallest percentage of the nationaldebt is held by individuals in this form. Most government bonds, except thoseowned by the government itself through its trust funds, are held by vast bankingfirms known as international banks.For centuries there has been big money to be made by international bankers inthe financing of governments and kings. Such operators are faced, however, withcertain thorny problems. We know that smaller banking operations protectthemselves by taking collateral, but what kind of collateral can you get from agovernment or a king? What if the banker comes to collect and the king says,\"Off with his head\"? The process through which one collects a debt from agovernment or a monarch is not a subject taught in the business schools of ouruniversities, and most of us - never having been in the business of financingkings - have not given the problem much thought. But there is a king-financingbusiness and to those who can ensure collection it is lucrative indeed.Economics Professor Stuart Crane notes that there are two means used tocollateralize loans to governments and kings. Whenever a business firm borrowsbig money its creditor obtains a voice in management to protect his investment.Like a business, no government can borrow big money unless willing to surrenderto the creditor some measure of sovereignty as collateral. Certainlyinternational bankers who have loaned hundreds of billions of dollars togovernments around the world command considerable influence in the policies ofsuch governments.But the ultimate advantage the creditor has over the king or president is thatif the ruler gets out of line the banker can finance his enemy or rival.Therefore, if you want to stay in the lucrative king-financing business, it iswise to have an enemy or rival waiting in the wings to unseat every king orpresident to whom you lend. If the king doesn't have an enemy, you must createone.Preeminent in playing this game was the famous House of Rothschild. Its founder,Meyer Amschel Rothschild (1743-1812) of Frankfurt, Germany, kept one of his fivesons at home to run the Frankfurt bank and sent the others to London, Paris,Vienna and Naples. The Rothschilds became incredibly wealthyduring the nineteenth century by financing governments to fight each other.According to Professor Stuart Crane:âIf you will look back at every war in Europe during the Nineteenth Century, youwill see that they always ended with the establishment of a 'balance of power'.With every reshuffling there was a balance of power in a new grouping around theHouse of Rothschild in England, France, or Austria. They grouped nations so thatif any king got out of line a war would break out and the war would be decidedby which way the financing went. Researching the debt positions of the warringnations will usually indicate who was to be punished.âIn describing the characteristics of the Rothschilds and other majorinternational bankers, Dr. Quigley tells us that they remained different fromordinary bankers in several ways: they were cosmopolitan and international; theywere close to governments and were particularly concerned with government debts,including foreign government debts; these bankers came to be called\"international bankers.\" (Quigley, Tragedy and Hope, p.52)One major reason for the historical blackout on the role of the internationalbankers in political history is that the Rothschilds were Jewish. Anti-Semiteshave played into the hands of the conspiracy by trying to portray the entireconspiracy as Jewish. Nothing could be farther from the truth. The traditionallyAnglo-Saxon J.P. Morgan and Rockefeller international banking institutions haveplayed a key role in the conspiracy. But there is no denying the importance ofthe Rothschilds and their satellites. However, it is just as unreasonable andimmoral to blame all Jews for the crimes of the Rothschilds as it is to hold allBaptists accountable for the crimes of the Rockefellers.The Jewish members of the conspiracy have used an organization called theAnti-Defamation League as an instrument to try to convince everyone that anymention of the Rothschilds or their allies is an attack on all Jews. In this waythey have stifled almost all honest scholarship on international bankers andmade the subject taboo within universities.Any individual or book exploring this subject is immediately attacked byhundreds of A.D.L. committees all over the country. The A.D.L. has never lettruth or logic interfere with its highly professional smear jobs. When noevidence is apparent, the A.D.L., which staunchly opposed so-called\"McCarthyism,\" accuses people of being \"latent anti-Semites.\" Can you imaginehow they would yowl and scream if someone accused them of being \"latent\"Communists?Actually, nobody has a right to be angrier at the Rothschild clique than theirfellow Jews. The Warburgs, part of the Rothschild empire, helped finance AdolphHitler. There were few if any Rothschilds or Warburgs in the Nazi prison camps!They sat out the war in luxurious hotels in Paris or emigrated to the UnitedStates or England. As a group, Jews have suffered most at the hands of thesepower seekers. A Rothschild has much more in common with a Rockefeller than hedoes with a tailor from Budapest or the Bronx.Since the keystone of the international banking empires has been governmentbonds it has been in the interest of these international bankers to encouragegovernment debt. The higher the debt, the more the interest. Nothing drivesgovernment deeply into debt like a war; and it has not been an uncommon practiceamong international bankers to finance both sides of the bloodiest militaryconflicts. For example, during our Civil War the North was financed by theRothschilds through their American agent, August Belmont, and the American Souththrough the Erlangers, Rothschild relatives.But while wars and revolutions have been useful to international bankers ingaining or increasing control over governments, the key to such control hasalways been control of money. You can control a government if you have it inyour debt; a creditor is in a position to demand the privileges of monopoly fromthe sovereign. Money-seeking governments have granted monopolies in statebanking, natural resources, oil concessions and transportation. However, themonopoly which the international financiers most covet is control over anation's money.Eventually these international bankers actually owned as private corporationsthe central banks of the various European nations. The Bank of England, Bank ofFrance and Bank of Germany were not owned by their respective governments, asalmost everyone imagines, but were privately owned monopolies granted by theheads of state, usually in return for loans. Under this system, observedReginald McKenna, President of the Midlands Bank of England: \"Those that createand issue the money and credit direct the policies of government and hold intheir hands the destiny of the people.\" Once the government is in debt to thebankers it is at their mercy. A frightening example was cited by the LondonFinancial Times of September 26, 1921, which revealed that even at that time:\"Half a dozen men at the top of the Big Five Banks could upset the whole fabricof government finance by refraining from renewing Treasury Bills.\"All those who have sought dictatorial control over modern nations haveunderstood the necessity of a central bank. When the League of Just Men hired ahack revolutionary named Karl Marx to write a blueprint for conquest called TheCommunist Manifesto, the fifth plank read: \"Centralization of credit in thehands of the state, by means of a national bank with state capital and anexclusive monopoly.\" Lenin later said that the establishment of a central bankwas ninety percent of communizing a country. Such conspirators knew that youcannot take control of a nation without military force unless that nation has acentral bank through which you can control its economy. The anarchist Bakuninsarcastically remarked about the followers of Karl Marx: \"They have one foot inthe bank and one foot in the socialist movement.\"The international financiers set up their own front man in charge of each ofEurope's central banks. Professor Quigley reports:âIt must not be felt that these heads of the world's chief central banks werethemselves substantive powers in world finance. They were not. Rather, they werethe technicians and agents of the dominant investment bankers of their owncountries, who had raised them up and were perfectly capable of throwing themdown. The substantive financial powers of the world were in the hands of theseinvestment bankers (also called 'international' or 'merchants' bankers) whoremained largely behind the scenes in their own unincorporated private banks.These formed a system of international cooperation and national dominance whichwas more private, more powerful, and more secret than that of their agents inthe central banksâ¦â (Quigley, Tragedy and Hope, pp.326-7.)Dr. Quigley also reveals that the international bankers who owned and controlledthe Banks of England and France maintained their power even after those Bankswere theoretically socialized.Naturally those who controlled the central banks of Europe were eager from thestart to fasten a similar establishment on the United States. From the earliestdays, the Founding Fathers had been conscious of attempts to control Americathrough money manipulation, and they carried on a running battle with theinternational bankers. Thomas Jefferson wrote to John Adams: \"â¦I sincerelybelieve, with you, that banking establishments are more dangerous than standingarmiesâ¦âBut, even though America did not have a central bank after President Jacksonabolished it in 1836, the European financiers and their American agents managedto obtain a great deal of control over our monetary system. Gustavus Myers, inhis History of The Great American Fortunes, reveals:\"Under the surface, the Rothschilds long had a powerful influence in dictatingAmerican financial laws. The law records show that they were powers in the oldBank of the United States [abolished by Andrew Jackson].\"During the nineteenth century the leading financiers of the metropolitan Eastoften cut one another's financial throats, but as their Western and ruralvictims started to organize politically, the \"robber barons\" saw that they had a\"community of interest\" toward which they must work together to protectthemselves from thousands of irate farmers and up and coming competitors. Thisdiffusion of economic power was one of the main factors stimulating the demandsfor a central bank by would-be business and financial monopolists.In Years of Plunder Proctor Hansl writes of this era:\"Among the Morgans, Kuhn-Loebs and other similar pillars of the industrial orderthere was less disposition to become involved in disagreements that led tofinancial dislocation. A community of interest came into being, with resultsthat were highly beneficialâ¦\"But aside from the major Eastern centers, most American bankers and theircustomers still distrusted the whole concept.In order to show the hinterlands that they were going to need a central bankingsystem, the international bankers created a series of panics as a demonstrationof their powerâa warning of what would happen unless the rest of the bankers gotinto line. The man in charge of conducting these lessons was J. Pierpont-Morgan,American-born but educated in England and Germany. Morgan is referred to bymany, including Congressman Louis McFadden, (a banker who for ten years headedthe House Banking and Currency Committee), as the top American agent of theEnglish Rothschilds.By the turn of the century J.P. Morgan was already an old hand at creatingartificial panics. Such affairs were well coordinated. Senator Robert Owen, aco-author of the Federal Reserve Act, (who later deeply regretted his role),testified before a Congressional Committee that the bank he owned received fromthe National Bankers' Association what came to be known as the \"Panic Circularof 1893.\" It stated: \"You will at once retire one-third of your circulation andcall in one-half of your loansâ¦âHistorian Frederick Lewis Allen tells in Life magazine of April 25, 1949, ofMorgan's role in spreading rumors about the insolvency of the Knickerbocker Bankand The Trust Company of America, which rumors triggered the 1907 panic. Inanswer to the question: \"Did Morgan precipitate the panic?\" Allen reports:\"Oakleigh Thorne, the president of that particular trust company, testifiedlater before a congressional committee that his bank had been subjected to onlymoderate withdrawals â¦ that he had not applied for help, and that it was the[Morgan's] 'sore point' statement alone that had caused the run on his bank.From this testimony, plus the disciplinary measures taken by the Clearing Houseagainst the Heinze, Morse and Thomas banks, plus other fragments of supposedlypertinent evidence, certain chroniclers have arrived at the ingenious conclusionthat the Morgan interests took advantage of the unsettled conditions during theautumn of 1907 to precipitate the panic, guiding it shrewdly as it progressed sothat it would kill off rival banks and consolidate the preeminence of the bankswithin the Morgan orbit.\"The \"panic\" which Morgan had created, he proceeded to end almostsingle-handedly. He had made his point. Frederick Allen explains:\"The lesson of the Panic of 1907 was clear, though not for some six years was itdestined to be embodied in legislation: the United States gravely needed acentral banking systemâ¦\"The man who was to play the most significant part in providing America with thatcentral bank was Paul Warburg, who along with his brother Felix had immigratedto the United States from Germany in 1902. (See Chart 4) They left brother Max(later a major financier of the Russian Revolution) at home in Frankfurt to runthe family bank (M.N. Warburg & Company).Paul Warburg married Nina Loeb, daughter of Solomon Loeb of Kuhn, Loeb andCompany, America's most powerful international banking firm. Brother Felixmarried Frieda Schiff, daughter of Jacob Schiff, the ruling power behind Kuhn,Loeb. Stephen Birmingham writes in his authoritative Our Crowd: \"In theeighteenth century the Schiffs and Rothschilds shared a double house\" inFrankfurt. Schiff reportedly bought his partnership in Kuhn, Loeb withRothschild money.Both Paul and Felix Warburg became partners in Kuhn, Loeb and Company.In 1907, the year of the Morgan-precipitated panic, Paul Warburg began spendingalmost all of his time writing and lecturing on the need for \"bank reform.\"Kuhn, Loeb and Company was sufficiently public spirited about the matter to keephim on salary at $500,000 per year while for the next six years he donated histime to \"the public good.\"Working with Warburg in promoting this \"banking reform\" was Nelson Aldrich,known as \"Morgan's floor broker in the Senate.\" Aldrich's daughter Abby marriedJohn D. Rockefeller, Jr. (the current Governor of New York is named for hismaternal grandfather).[../images/00006.jpeg]After the Panic of 1907, Aldrich was appointed by the Senate to head theNational Monetary Commission. Although he had no technical knowledge of banking,Aldrich and his entourage spent nearly two years and $300,000 of the taxpayers'money being wined and dined by the owners of Europe's central banks as theytoured the Continent \"studying\" central banking. When the Commission returnedfrom its luxurious junket it held no meetings and made no report for nearly twoyears. But Senator Aldrich was busy \"arranging\" things. Together with PaulWarburg and other international bankers, he staged one of the most importantsecret meetings in the history of the United States. Rockefeller agent FrankVanderlip admitted many years later in his memoirs:\"Despite my views about the value to society of greater publicity for theaffairs of corporations, there was an occasion, near the close of 1910, when Iwas as secretiveâindeed as furtiveâas any conspiratorâ¦I do not feel it is anyexaggeration to speak of our secret expedition to Jekyll Island as the occasionof the actual conception of what eventually became the Federal Reserve System.\"The secrecy was well warranted. At stake was control over the entire economy.Senator Aldrich had issued confidential invitations to Henry P. Davison of J.P.Morgan & Company; Frank A. Vanderlip, President of the Rockefeller-ownedNational City Bank; A. Piatt Andrew, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury;Benjamin Strong of Morgan's Bankers Trust Company; and Paul Warburg. They wereall to accompany him to Jekyll Island, Georgia, to write the finalrecommendations of the National Monetary Commission report.At Jekyll Island, writes B.C. Forbes in his Men Who Are Making America:\"After a general discussion it was decided to draw up certain broad principleson which all could agree. Every member of the group voted for a central bank asbeing the ideal cornerstone for any banking system.\" (Page 399)Warburg stressed that the name \"central bank\" must be avoided at all costs. Itwas decided to promote the scheme as a \"regional reserve\" system with four(later twelve) branches in different sections of the country. The conspiratorsknew that the New York bank would dominate the rest, which would be marble\"white elephants\" to deceive the public.Out of the Jekyll Island meeting came the completion of the Monetary CommissionReport and the Aldrich Bill. Warburg had proposed the bill be designated the\"Federal Reserve System,\" but Aldrich insisted his own name was alreadyassociated in the public's mind with banking reform and that it would arousesuspicion if a bill were introduced which did not bear his name. However,Aldrich's name attached to the bill proved to be the kiss of death, since anylaw bearing his name was so obviously a project of the international bankers.When the Aldrich Bill could not be pushed through Congress, a new strategy hadto be devised. The Republican Party was too closely connected with Wall Street.The only hope for a central bank was to disguise it and have it put through bythe Democrats as a measure to strip Wall Street of its power. The opportunity todo this came with the approach of the 1912 Presidential election. RepublicanPresident William Howard Taft, who had turned against the Aldrich Bill, seemed asurefire bet for reelection until Taft's predecessor, fellow Republican TeddyRoosevelt, agreed to run on the ticket of the Progressive Party. In America's 60Families, Ferdinand Lundberg acknowledges:\"As soon as Roosevelt signified that he would again challenge Taft thePresident's defeat was inevitable. Throughout the three-cornered fight[Taft-Roosevelt-Wilson] Roosevelt had [Morgan agents Frank] Munsey and [George]Perkins constantly at his heels, supplying money, going over his speeches,bringing people from Wall Street in to help, and, in general, carrying theentire burden of the campaign against Taftâ¦Perkins and J.P. Morgan and Company were the substance of the Progressive Party;everything else was trimmingâ¦In short, most of Roosevelt's campaign fund was supplied by the two Morganhatchet men who were seeking Taft's scalp.\" (pp.110-112)The Democrat candidate, Woodrow Wilson, was equally the property of Morgan. Dr.Gabriel Kolko in his The Triumph of Conservatism, reports: \"In late 1907 he[Wilson] supported the Aldrich Bill on banking, and was full of praise forMorgan's role in American society.\" (Page 205) According to Lundberg: \"Fornearly twenty years before his nomination Woodrow Wilson had moved in the shadowof Wall Street.\" (Page 112)Woodrow Wilson and Teddy Roosevelt proceeded to whistle-stop the country tryingto outdo each other in florid (and hypocritical) denunciations of the WallStreet \"money trust\"âthe same group of Insiders which was financing thecampaigns of both.Dr. Kolko goes on to tell us that, at the beginning of 1912, banking reform\"seemed a dead issueâ¦ The banking reform movement had neatly isolated itself.\"Wilson resurrected the issue and promised the country a money system free fromdomination by the international bankers of Wall Street. Moreover, the Democratplatform expressly stated: \"We are opposed to the Aldrich plan for a centralbank.\" But the \"Big Boys\" knew who they had bought. Among the internationalfinanciers who contributed heavily to the Wilson campaign, in addition to thosealready named, were Jacob Schiff, Bernard Baruch, Henry Morgenthau, ThomasFortune Ryan, and New York Times publisher Adolph Ochs.The Insiders sheepdog who controlled Wilson and guided the program throughCongress was the mysterious \"Colonel\" Edward Mandel House, the British-educatedson of a representative of England's financial interests in the American South.The title was honorary; House never served in the military. He was strictly abehind-the-scenes wire-puller and is regarded by many historians as the realPresident of the United States during the Wilson years. House authored a book,Philip Dru: Administrator, in which he wrote of establishing \"Socialism asdreamed by Karl Marx\" as steps toward his goal, House, both in his book and inreal life, called for passage of a graduated income tax and a central bankproviding \"a flexible [inflatable paper] currency.\" The graduated income tax anda central bank are two of the ten planks of The Communist Manifesto.In his The Intimate Papers of Colonel House, Professor Charles Seymour refers tothe \"Colonel\" as the \"unseen guardian angel\" of the Federal Reserve Act.Seymour's work contains numerous documents and records showing constant contactbetween House and Paul Warburg while the Federal Reserve Act was being preparedand steered through Congress. Biographer George Viereck assures us that \"TheSchiffs, the Warburgs, the Kahns, the Rockefellers, and the Morgans put theirfaith in Houseâ¦\" Their faith was amply rewarded.In order to support the fiction that the Federal Reserve Act was \"a people'sbill,\" the Insider financiers put up a smoke screen of opposition to it. It wasstrictly a case of Brâer Rabbit begging not to be thrown into the briar patch.Both Aldrich and Vanderlip denounced what in actuality was their own bill.Nearly twenty-five years later Frank Vanderlip admitted: \"Now although theAldrich Federal Reserve Plan was defeated when it bore the name Aldrich,nevertheless its essential points were all contained in the plan that finallywas adopted.\"Taking advantage of Congress' desire to adjourn for Christmas, the FederalReserve Act was passed on December 22, 1913 by a vote of 298 to 60 in the House,and in the Senate by a majority of 43 to 25. Wilson had fulfilled to theInsiders the pledge he had made in order to become President. Warburg toldHouse, \"Well, it hasn't got quite everything we want, but the lack can beadjusted later by administrative process.\"There was genuine opposition to the Act, but it could not match the power of thebill's advocates. Conservative Henry Cabot Lodge Sr. proclaimed with greatforesight, \"The bill as it stands seems to me to open the way to a vastinflation of currencyâ¦I do not like to think that any law can be passed whichwill make it possible to submerge the gold standard in a flood of irredeemablepaper currency.\" (Congressional Record, June 10, 1932.) After the vote,Congressman Charles A. Lindbergh Sr., father of the famous aviator, toldCongress:\"This act establishes the most gigantic trust on earthâ¦ When the President signsthis act the invisible government by the money power, proven to exist by theMoney Trust investigation, will be legalizedâ¦This is the Aldrich Bill in disguiseâ¦The new law will create inflation whenever the trusts want inflationâ¦âThe Federal Reserve Act was, and still is, hailed as a victory of \"democracy\"over the \"money trust.\" Nothing could be farther from the truth.The whole central bank concept was engineered by the very group it was supposedto strip of power. The myth that the \"money trust\" had been defrocked shouldhave been exploded when Paul Warburg was appointed to the first Federal ReserveBoardâa board which was hand-picked by \"Colonel\" House. Paul Warburgrelinquished his $500,000 a year job as a Kuhn, Loeb partner to take a $12,000 ayear job with the Federal Reserve. The \"accidentalists\" who teach in ouruniversities would have you believe that he did it because he was a \"publicspirited citizen.\" And the man who served as Chairman of the New York FederalReserve Bank during its early critical years was the same Benjamin Strong of theMorgan interests, who accompanied Warburg, Davison, Vanderlip, et al. to JekyllIsland, Georgia, to draft the Aldrich Bill.How powerful is our \"central bank?\" The Federal Reserve controls our moneysupply and interest rates, and thereby manipulates the entire economyâcreatinginflation or deflation, recession or boom, and sending the stock market up ordown at whim. The Federal Reserve is so powerful that Congressman Wright Patman,Chairman of the House Banking Committee, maintains:\"In the United States today we have in effect two governmentsâ¦ We have the dulyconstituted Governmentâ¦ Then we have an independent, uncontrolled anduncoordinated government in the Federal Reserve System, operating the moneypowers which are reserved to Congress by the Constitution.\"Neither Presidents, Congressmen nor Secretaries of the Treasury direct theFederal Reserve! In the matters of money, the Federal Reserve directs them! Theuncontrolled power of the \"Fed\" was admitted by Secretary of the Treasury DavidM. Kennedy in an interview for the May 5, 1969, issue of U.S. News & WorldReport:Q: âDo you approve of the latest credit-tightening moves?âA: âIt's not my job to approve or disapprove. It is the action of the FederalReserve.\"[../images/00007.jpeg]Professor Carroll Quigley of Harvard, Princeton, and Georgetown Universitieswrote a book disclosing an international bankers' plan to control the world frombehind the political and financial scenes. Quigley revealed plans ofbillionaires to establish dictatorship of the super-rich disguised as workers'democracies. [../images/00008.jpeg]J.P. Morgan created artificial panic used as excuse to pass Federal Reserve Act.Morgan was instrumental in pushing U. S. into WWI to protect his loans toBritish government. He financed Socialist groups to create an all-powerfulcentralized government which international bankers would control at the apexfrom behind the scenes. After his death, his partners helped finance theBolshevik Revolution in Russia. And, curiously enough, the Federal Reserve System has never been audited and hasfirmly resisted all attempts by House Banking Committee Chairman Wright Patmanto have it audited. (N.Y. Times, Sept. 14, 1967.)How successful has the Federal Reserve System been? It depends on your point ofview. Since Woodrow Wilson took his oath of office, the national debt has risenfrom $1 billion to $455 billion The total amount of interest paid since then tothe international bankers holding that debt is staggering, with interest havingbecome the third largest item in the federal budget. Interest on the nationaldebt is now $22 billion every year, and climbing steeply as inflation pushes upthe interest rate on government bonds. Meanwhile, our gold is mortgaged toEuropean central banks, and our silver has all been sold. With economiccatastrophe imminent, only a blind disciple of the \"accidental theory ofhistory\" could believe that all of this has occurred by coincidence.When the Federal Reserve System was foisted on an unsuspecting American public,there were absolute guarantees that there would be no more boom and busteconomic cycles. The men who, behind the scenes, were pushing the central bankconcept for the international bankers faithfully promised that from then onthere would be only steady growth and perpetual prosperity. However, CongressmanCharles A. Lindberg Sr. accurately proclaimed: \"From now on depressions will bescientifically created.\"Using a central bank to create alternate periods of inflation and deflation, andthus whipsawing the public for vast profits, had been worked out by theinternational bankers to an exact science.Having built the Federal Reserve as a tool to consolidate and control wealth,the international bankers were now ready to make a major killing. Between 1923and 1929, the Federal Reserve expanded (inflated) the money supply by sixty-twopercent. Much of this new money was used to bid the stock market up to dizzyingheights.At the same time that enormous amounts of credit money were being madeavailable, the mass media began to ballyhoo tales of the instant riches to bemade in the stock market. According to Ferdinand Lundberg:\"For profits to be made on these funds the public had to be induced tospeculate, and it was so induced by misleading newspaper accounts, many of thembought and paid for by the brokers that operated the poolsâ¦\"The House Hearings on Stabilization of the Purchasing Power of the Dollardisclosed evidence in 1928 that the Federal Reserve Board was working closelywith the heads of European central banks. The Committee warned that a majorcrash had been planned in 1927. At a secret luncheon of the Federal ReserveBoard and heads of the European central banks, the committee warned, theinternational bankers were tightening the noose.Montagu Norman, Governor of the Bank of England, came to Washington on February6, 1929, to confer with Andrew Mellon, Secretary of the Treasury. On November11, 1927, the Wall Street Journal described Mr. Norman as \"the currency dictatorof Europe.\" Professor Carroll Quigley notes that Norman, a close confidant ofJ.P. Morgan, admitted: \"I hold the hegemony of the world.\" Immediately afterthis mysterious visit, the Federal Reserve Board reversed its easy money policyand began raising the discount rate. The balloon which had been inflatedconstantly for nearly seven years was about to be exploded.On October 24, the feathers hit the fan. Writing in The United States'Unresolved Monetary and Political Problems, William Bryan describes whathappened:\"When everything was ready, the New York financiers started calling 24 hourbroker call loans. This meant that the stockbrokers and the customers had todump their stock on the market in order to pay the loans. This naturallycollapsed the stock market and brought a banking collapse all over the countrybecause the banks not owned by the oligarchy were heavily involved in brokercall claims at this time, and bank runs soon exhausted their coin and currencyand they had to close. The Federal Reserve System would not come to their aid,although they were instructed under the law to maintain an elastic currency.\"The investing public, including most stock brokers and bankers, took ahorrendous blow in the crash, but not the Insiders. They were either out of themarket or had sold \"short\" so that they made enormous profits as the Dow Jonesplummeted. For those who knew the score, a comment by Paul Warburg had providedthe warning to sell. That signal came on March 9, 1929, when the FinancialChronicle quoted Warburg as giving this sound advice:\"If orgies of unrestricted speculation are permitted to spread too farâ¦theultimate collapse is certainâ¦to bring about a general depression involving thewhole country.\"Sharpies were later able to buy back these stocks at a ninety percent discountfrom their former highs.To think that the scientifically engineered Crash of '29 was an accident or theresult of stupidity defies all logic. The international bankers who promoted theinflationary policies and pushed the propaganda which pumped up the stock marketrepresented too many generations of accumulated expertise to have blundered into\"the great depression.\"Congressman Louis McFadden, Chairman of the House Banking and CurrencyCommittee, commented:\"It [the depression] was not accidental. It was a carefully contrivedoccurrenceâ¦ The international bankers sought to bring about a condition ofdespair here so that they might emerge as the rulers of us all.\"Although we have not had another depression of the magnitude of that whichfollowed 1929, we have since suffered regular recessions. Each of these hasfollowed a period in which the Federal Reserve tromped down hard on the moneyaccelerator and then slammed on the brakes. Since 1929 the following recessionshave been created by such manipulation:1936-1937 Stock prices fell 50%1948 Stock prices dropped 16%1953 Stock declined 13%1956-1957 The market dipped 13%1957 Late in the year the market plunged 19%1960 The market was off 17%1966 Stock prices plummeted 25%1970 The market plunged over 25% Chart 5, based on one appearing in the highly respected financial publication,Indicator Digest of June 24, 1969, shows the effects on the Dow-Jones IndustrialAverage of Federal Reserve policies of expanding or restricting the monetarysupply. This is how the stock market is manipulated and how depressions orrecessions are scientifically created. If you have inside knowledge as to whichway the Federal Reserve policy is going to go, you can make a ton of money. [../images/00009.jpeg] The members of the Federal Reserve Board are appointed by the President forfourteen year terms. Since these positions control the entire economy of thecountry they are far more important than cabinet positions, but who has everheard of any of them except possibly Chairman Arthur Burns? These appointmentswhich should be extensively debated by the Senate are routinely approved. But,here, as in Europe, these men are mere figureheads, put in their positions atthe behest of the international bankers who finance the Presidential campaignsof both political parties.And, Professor Quigley reveals that these international bankers who owned andcontrolled the Banks of England and France maintained their power even afterthose banks were theoretically socialized. The American system is slightlydifferent, but the net effect is the sameâever increasing debt requiringever-increasing interest payments, inflation and periodic scientifically createddepressions and recessions. The end result, if the Insiders have their way, willbe the dream of Montagu Norman of the Bank of England \"that the Hegemony ofWorld Finance should reign supreme over everyone, everywhere, as one wholesuper-national control mechanism.\" (Montagu Norman by John Hargrave, GreystonePress, N.Y., 1942.) [../images/00010.jpeg][../images/00011.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4BANKROLLING THE BOLSHEVIK REVOLUTION The establishing of the Federal Reserve System provided the \"conspiracy\" with aninstrument whereby the international bankers could run the national debt up tothe sky, thereby collecting enormous amounts of interest and also gainingcontrol over the borrower. During the Wilson Administration alone, the nationaldebt expanded 800 percent.Two months prior to the passage of the Federal Reserve Act, the conspirators hadcreated the mechanism to collect the funds to pay the interest on the nationaldebt. That mechanism was the progressive income tax, the second plank of KarlMarx' Communist Manifesto which contained ten planks for SOCIALIZING a country.One quite naturally assumes that the graduated income tax would be opposed bythe wealthy. The fact is that many of the wealthiest Americans supported it.Some, no doubt, out of altruism and because, at first, the taxes were verysmall. But others backed the scheme because they already had a plan forpermanently avoiding both the income tax and the subsequent inheritance tax.What happened was this: At the turn of the century the Populists, a group ofrural socialists, were gaining strength and challenging the power of the NewYork bankers and monopolist industrialists. While the Populists had the wronganswers, they asked many of the right questions. Unfortunately, they were led tobelieve that the banker-monopolist control over government, which they opposed,was a product of free enterprise.Since the Populist threat to the cartelists was from the Left (there being noorganized political movement for laissez-faire), the Insiders moved to capturethe Left. Professor Quigley discloses that over fifty years ago the Morgan firmdecided to infiltrate the Leftwing political movement in the United States. Thiswas not difficult to do since these Left groups needed funds and were eager forhelp to get their message to the public. Wall Street supplied both. There wasnothing new about this decision, says Quigley, since other financiers had talkedabout it and even attempted it earlier. He continues:\"What made it decisively important this time was the combination of its adoptionby the dominant Wall Street financier, at a time when tax policy was driving allfinanciers to seek tax-exempt refuges for their fortunesâ¦\" (Page 938)Radical movements are never successful unless they attract big money and/oroutside support. The great historian of the Twentieth Century, Oswald Spengler,was one of those who saw what American Liberals refuse to seeâthat the Left iscontrolled by its alleged enemy, the malefactors of great wealth. He wrote inhis monumental Decline of the West (Modern Library, New York, 1945):\"There is no proletarian, not even a Communist, movement, that has not operatedin the interests of money, in the direction indicated by money, and for the timebeing permitted by moneyâand that without the idealists among its leaders havingthe slightest suspicion of the fact.\"While the Populist movement was basically non-conspiratorial, its Leftistideology and platform were made to order for the elitist Insiders because itaimed at concentrating power in government. The Insiders knew they could controlthat power and use it to their own purposes. They were not, of course,interested in promoting competition but in restricting it. Professor GabrielKolko has prepared a lengthy volume presenting the undeniable proof that thegiant corporate manipulators promoted much of the so-called \"progressivelegislation\" of the Roosevelt and Wilson erasâlegislation which ostensibly wasaimed at controlling their abuses, but which was so written as to suit theirinterests. In The Triumph of Conservatism (by which Kolko mistakenly means bigbusiness), he notes:ââ¦the significant reason for many businessmen welcoming and working to increasefederal intervention into their affairs has been virtually ignored by historiansand economists. The oversight was due to the illusion that American industry wascentralized and monopolized to such an extent that it could rationalize theactivity [regulate production and prices] in its various branches voluntarily.Quite the opposite was true. Despite the large numbers of mergers, and thegrowth in the absolute size of many corporations, the dominant tendency in theAmerican economy at the beginning of this century was toward growingcompetition. Competition was unacceptable to many key business and financialinterestsâ¦\"The best way for the Insiders to eliminate this growing Competition was toimpose a progressive income tax on their competitors while writing the laws soas to include built-in escape hatches for themselves. Actually, very few of theproponents of the graduated income tax realized they were playing into the handsof those they were seeking to control. As Ferdinand Lundberg notes in The Richand the Super-Rich:\"What it [the income tax] became, finally, was a siphon gradually inserted intothe pocketbooks of the general public. Imposed to popular huzzas as a class tax,the income tax was gradually turned into a mass tax in a jiu-jitsu turnaroundâ¦\"The Insiders principal mouthpiece in the Senate during this period was NelsonAldrich, one of the conspirators involved in engineering the creation of theFederal Reserve and the maternal grandfather of Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller.Lundberg says that \"When Aldrich spoke, newsmen understood that although thewords were his, the dramatic line was surely approved by 'Big John [D.Rockefeller]â¦ '\" In earlier years Aldrich had denounced the income tax as\"communistic and socialistic,\" but in 1909 he pulled a dramatic and stunningreversal. The American Biographical Dictionary comments:\"Just when the opposition had become formidable he [Aldrich] took the wind outof its sails by bringing forward, with the support of the President [Taft], aproposed amendment to the Constitution empowering Congress to lay income taxes.\"Howard Hinton records in his biography of Cordell Hull that Congressman Hull,who had been pushing in the House for the income tax, wrote this stunnedobservation:\"During the past few weeks the unexpected spectacle of certain so-called'old-line conservative' [sic] Republican leaders in Congress suddenly reversingtheir attitude of a lifetime and seemingly espousing, through ill-concealedreluctance, the proposed income-tax amendment to the Constitution has been theoccasion of universal surprise and wonder.\"The escape hatch for the Insiders to avoid paying taxes was ready. By the timethe Amendment had been approved by the states (even before the income-tax waspassed), the Rockefellers and Carnegie foundations were in full operation.One must remember that it was to break up the Standard Oil (Rockefeller) andU.S. Steel (Carnegie) monopolies that the various anti-trust acts wereostensibly passed. These monopolists could now compound their wealth tax-freewhile competitors had to face a graduated income tax which made it difficult toamass capital. As we have said, socialism is not a share-the-wealth program, asthe socialists would like you to believe, but aconsolidate-and-control-the-wealth program for the Insiders. The Reece Committeewhich investigated foundations for Congress in 1953 proved with an overwhelmingamount of evidence that the various Rockefeller and Carnegie foundations havebeen promoting socialism since their inception. (See Rene Wormser's Foundations:Their Power and Influence, Devin Adair, New York, 1958.)The conspirators now had created the mechanisms to run up the debt, to collectthe debt, and (for themselves) to avoid the taxes required to pay the yearlyinterest on the debt. Then all that was needed was a reason to escalate thedebt. Nothing runs up a national debt like a war. And World War I was beingbrewed in Europe.In 1916, Woodrow Wilson was re-elected by a hair. He had based his campaign onthe slogan: \"He Kept Us Out of War!\" The American public was extremely opposedto America's getting involved in a European war. Staying out of the perennialforeign quarrels had been an American tradition since George Washington. But asWilson was stumping the country giving his solemn word that American soldierswould not be sent into a foreign war, he was preparing to do just the opposite.His \"alter ego,\" as he called \"Colonel\" House, was making behind-the-scenesagreements with England which committed America to entering the war. Just fivemonths later we were in it. The same crowd which manipulated the passage of theincome tax and the Federal Reserve System wanted America in the war. J.P.Morgan, John D. Rockefeller, \"Colonel\" House, Jacob Schiff, Paul Warburg and therest of the Jekyll Island conspirators were all deeply involved in getting usinvolved. Many of these financiers had loaned England large sums of money. Infact, J.P. Morgan & Co. served as British financial agents in this countryduring World War I.While all of the standard reasons given for the outbreak of World War I inEurope doubtless were factors, there were also other more important causes. Theconspiracy had been planning the war for over two decades.The assassination of an Austrian Archduke was merely an incident providing anexcuse for starting a chain reaction.After years of fighting, the war was a complete stalemate and would have endedalmost immediately in a negotiated settlement (as had most other Europeanconflicts) had not the U. S. declared war on Germany.As soon as Wilson's reelection had been engineered through the \"he kept us outof war\" slogan, a complete reversal of propaganda was instituted. In those daysbefore radio and television, public opinion was controlled almost exclusively bynewspapers. Many of the major newspapers were controlled by the Federal Reservecrowd. Now they began beating the drums over the \"inevitability of war.\" ArthurPonsonby, a member of the British parliament, admitted in his book Falsehood inWar Time (E.P. Dutton & Co., Inc., New York, 1928): \"There must have been moredeliberate lying in the world from 1914 to 1918 than in any other period of theworld's history.\" Propaganda concerning the war was heavily one-sided. Althoughafter the war many historians admitted that one side was as guilty as the otherin starting the war, Germany was pictured as a militaristic monster which wantedto rule the world. Remember, this picture was painted by Britain which had itssoldiers in more countries around the world than all other nations put together.So-called \"Prussian militarism\" did exist, but it was no threat to conquer theworld. Meanwhile, the sun never set on the British Empire! Actually, the Germanswere proving to be tough business competitors in the world's markets and theBritish did not approve.In order to generate war fever, the sinking of the Lusitaniaâa British shiptorpedoed two years earlierâwas revived and given renewed headlines. Germansubmarine warfare was turned into a major issue by the newspapers.Submarine warfare was a phony issue. Germany and England were at war. Each wasblockading the other country. J.P. Morgan and other financiers were sellingmunitions to Britain. The Germans could not allow those supplies to be deliveredany more than the English would have allowed them to be delivered to Germany. IfMorgan wanted to take the risks and reap the rewards (or suffer theconsequences) of selling munitions to England, that was his business. It wascertainly nothing over which the entire nation should have been dragged intowar.The Lusitania, at the time it was sunk, was carrying six million rounds ofammunition. It was actually illegal for American passengers to be aboard a shipcarrying munitions to belligerents. Almost two years before the liner was sunk,the New York Tribune (June 19, 1913) carried a squib which stated: \"Cunardofficials acknowledged to the Tribune correspondent today that the greyhound[Lusitania] is being equipped with high power naval riflesâ¦ \"In fact, theLusitania was registered in the British navy as an auxiliary cruiser. (Barnes,Harry E., The Genesis of the War, Alfred Knopf, New York, 1926, p.611.) Inaddition, the German government took out large ads in all the New York paperswarning potential passengers that the ship was carrying munitions and tellingthem not to cross the Atlantic on it. Those who chose to make the trip knew therisk they were taking. Yet the sinking of the Lusitania was used by cleverpropagandists to portray the Germans as inhuman slaughterers of innocents.Submarine warfare was manufactured into a cause celebre to push us into war. OnApril 6, 1917, Congress declared war. The American people acquiesced on thebasis that it would be a \"war to end all wars.\"During the \"war to end all wars,\" Insider banker Bernard Baruch was madeabsolute dictator over American business when President Wilson appointed himChairman of the War Industries Board, where he had control of all domesticcontracts for Allied war materials. Baruch made lots of friends while placingtens of billions in government contracts, and it was widely rumored in WallStreet that out of the war to make the world safe for international bankers henetted $200 million for himself. [../images/00012.jpeg]\"Colonel\" House (left) was front man for the International banking fraternity.He manipulated President Woodrow Wilson (right) like a puppet Wilson called him\"my alter ego.\" House played a major role in creating The Federal ReserveSystem, passing the graduated Income tax and getting America into WWI. House'sInfluence over Wilson is an example that in the world of super-politics the realrulers are not always the ones the public sees. [../images/00013.jpeg]German born International financier Paul Warburg masterminded establishment ofFederal Reserve to put control over nation's economy in hands of internationalbankers. The Federal Reserve controls the money supply which allows manipulatorsto create alternate cycles of boom and bust, i.e., a roller coaster economy.This allows those in the know to make fabulous amounts of money, but even moreimportant, allows the Insiders to control the economy and further centralizepower in the federal government. While Insider banker Paul Warburg controlled the Federal Reserve, andinternational banker Bernard Baruch placed government contracts, internationalbanker Eugene Meyer, a former partner of Baruch and the son of a partner in theRothschilds' international banking house of Lazard Freres, was Wilson's choiceto head the War Finance Corporation, where he too made a little money.*It should be noted that Sir William Wiseman, the man sent by BritishIntelligence to help bring the United States into the war, was amply rewardedfor his services. He stayed in this country after WWI as a new partner in theJacob Schiff-Paul Warburg-controlled Kuhn, Loeb bank.World War I was a financial bonanza for the international bankers. But it was acatastrophe of such magnitude for the United States that few even today graspits importance. The war reversed our traditional foreign policy ofnon-involvement and we have been enmeshed almost constantly ever since inperpetual wars for perpetual peace. Winston Churchill once observed that allnations would have been better off had the U.S. minded its own business. Had wedone so, he said, \"peace would have been made with Germany; and there would havebeen no collapse in Russia leading to Communism; no breakdown of government inItaly followed by Fascism; and Nazism never would have gained ascendancy inGermany.\" (Social Justice Magazine, July 3, 1939, p.4)The Bolshevik Revolution in Russia was obviously one of the great turning pointsin world history. It is an event over which misinformation abounds. Themyth-makers and rewriters of history have done their landscape painting jobswell. The establishing of Communism in Russia is a classic example of the second\"big lie\" of Communism, i.e., that it is the movement of the downtrodden massesrising up against exploiting bosses. This cunning deception has been fosteredsince before the first French Revolution in 1789.Most people today believe the Communists were successful in Russia because theywere able to rally behind them the sympathy and frustration of the Russianpeople who were sick of the tyranny of the Czars. This is to ignore the historyof what actually happened. While almost everybody is reminded that the BolshevikRevolution took place in November of 1917, few know that the Czar had abdicatedseven months earlier in March. *Meyer later gained control of the highly influential Washington Post whichbecame known as the \"Washington Daily Worker.\" When Czar Nicholas II abdicated, a provisional government was established byPrince Lvov who wanted to pattern the new Russian government after our own. But,unfortunately, the Lvov government gave way to the Kerensky regime. Kerensky, aso-called democratic socialist, may have been running a caretaker government forthe Communists. He kept the war going against Germany and the other CentralPowers, but he issued a general amnesty for Communists and otherrevolutionaries, many of whom had been exiled after the abortive Red Revolutionof 1905. Back to mother Russia came 250,000 dedicated revolutionaries, andKerensky's own government's doom was sealed.In the Soviet Union, as in every Communist country (or as they callthemselvesâthe Socialist countries), the power has not come to the Communists'hands because the downtrodden masses willed it so. The power has come from thetop down in every instance. Let us briefly reconstruct the sequences of theCommunist takeover.The year is 1917. The Allies are fighting the Central Powers. The Allies includeRussia, the British Commonwealth, France and by April 1917, the United States.In March of 1917, purposeful planners set in motion the forces to compel CzarNicholas II to abdicate. He did so under pressure from the Allies after severeriots in the Czarist capitol of Petrograd, riots that were caused by thebreakdowns in the transportation system which cut the city off from foodsupplies and led to the closing of factories.But where were Lenin and Trotsky when all this was taking place? Lenin was inSwitzerland and had been in Western Europe since 1905 when he was exiled fortrying to topple the Czar in the abortive Communist revolution of that year.Trotsky also was in exile, a reporter for a Communist newspaper on the lowereast side of New York City. The Bolsheviks were not a visible political force atthe time the Czar abdicated. And they came to power not because the downtroddenmasses of Russia called them back, but because very powerful men in Europe andthe United States sent them in.Lenin was sent across Europe-at-war on the famous \"sealed train.\" With him Lenintook some $5 to $6 million in gold. The whole thing was arranged by the Germanhigh command and Max Warburg, through another very wealthy and lifelongsocialist by the name of Alexander Helphand alias \"Parvus.\" When Trotsky leftNew York aboard the S.S. Christiania, on March 27, 1917, with his entourage of275 revolutionaries, the first port of call was Halifax, Nova Scotia. There theCanadians grabbed Trotsky and his money and impounded them both. This was a verylogical thing for the Canadian government to do for Trotsky had said many timesthat if he were successful in coming to power in Russia he would immediatelystop what he called the \"imperialist war\" and sue for a separate peace withGermany. This would free millions of German troops for transfer from the Easternfront to the Western front where they could kill Canadians. So Trotsky cooledhis heels in a Canadian prisonâfor five days. Then all of a sudden the British(through future Kuhn, Loeb partner Sir William Wiseman) and the United States(through none other than the ubiquitous \"Colonel\" House) pressured the Canadiangovernment. And, despite the fact we were now in the war, said, in so manywords, \"Let Trotsky go.\" Thus, with an American passport, Trotsky went back tomeet Lenin. They joined up, and, by November, through bribery, cunning,brutality and deception, they were able (not to bring the masses rallying totheir cause but) to hire enough thugs and make enough deals to impose out of thegun barrel what Lenin called \"all power to the Soviets.\" The Communists came topower by seizing a mere handful of key cities. In fact, practically the wholeBolshevik Revolution took place in one cityâPetrograd. It was as if the wholeUnited States became Communist because a Communist-led mob seized Washington,D.C. It was years before the Soviets solidified power throughout Russia.The Germans, on the face of it, had a plausible excuse for financing Lenin andTrotsky. The two Germans most responsible for the financing of Lenin were MaxWarburg and a displaced Russian named Alexander Helphand. They could claim thatthey were serving their country's cause by helping and financing Lenin. However,these two German \"patriots\" neglected to mention to the Kaiser their plan tofoment a Communist revolution in Russia. The picture takes on another dimensionwhen you consider that the brother of Max Warburg was Paul Warburg, prime moverin establishing the Federal Reserve System and who from his position on theFederal Reserve Board of Directors, played a key role in financing the Americanwar effort. (When news leaked out in American papers about brother Max runningthe German finances, Paul resigned from his Federal Reserve post without awhimper.) From here on the plot sickens.For the father-in-law of Max Warburg's brother, Felix, was Jacob Schiff, seniorpartner in Kuhn, Loeb & Co. (Paul and Felix Warburg, you will recall, were alsopartners in Kuhn, Loeb & Co. while Max ran the Rothschild-allied family bank ofFrankfurt.) Jacob Schiff also helped finance Leon Trotsky. According to the NewYork Journal-American of February 3, 1949: \"Today it is estimated by Jacob'sgrandson, John Schiff, that the old man sank about 20,000,000 dollars for thefinal triumph of Bolshevism in Russia.\" (See Chart 6)One of the best sources of information on the financing of the BolshevikRevolution is Czarism and the Revolution by an important White Russian Generalnamed Arsene de Goulevitch who was founder in France of the Union of OppressedPeoples. In this volume, written in French and subsequently translated intoEnglish, de Goulevitch notes:\"The main purveyors of funds for the revolution, however, were neither thecrackpot Russian millionaires nor the armed bandits of Lenin. The 'real' moneyprimarily came from certain British and American circles which for a long timepast had lent their support to the Russian revolutionary causeâ¦âDe Goulevitch continues:\"The important part played by the wealthy American banker, Jacob Schiff, in theevents in Russia, though as yet only partially revealed, is no longer a secret.\"General Alexander Nechvolodov is quoted by de Goulevitch as stating in his bookon the Bolshevik Revolution:\"In April 1917, Jacob Schiff publicly declared that it was thanks to hisfinancial support that the revolution in Russia had succeeded.In the spring of the same year, Schiff commenced to subsidize Trotskyâ¦Simultaneously Trotsky and Co. were also being subsidized by Max Warburg andOlaf Aschberg of the Nye Banken of Stockholmâ¦ The Rhine Westphalian Syndicateand Jivotovskyâ¦whose daughter later married Trotsky.\"Schiff spent millions to overthrow the Czar and more millions to overthrowKerensky. He was sending money to Russia long after the true character of theBolsheviks was known to the world. Schiff raised $10 million, supposedly forJewish war relief in Russia, but later events revealed it to be a good businessinvestment. (Forbes, B.C., Men Who Are Making America, pp.334-5.)According to de Goulevitch:\"Mr. Bakhmetiev, the late Russian Imperial Ambassador to the United States,tells us that the Bolsheviks, after victory, transferred 600 million rubles ingold between the years 1918 and 1922 to Kuhn, Loeb & Company [Schiff's firm].\"Chart 6FINANCING THEBOLSHEVIK REVOLUTION[../images/00014.jpeg] Schiff's participation in the Bolshevik Revolution, though quite naturally nowdenied, was well known among Allied intelligence services at the time. This ledto much talk about Bolshevism being a Jewish plot. The result was that thesubject of financing the Communist takeover of Russia became taboo. Laterevidence indicates that the bankrolling of the Bolsheviks was handled by asyndicate of international bankers, which in addition to the Schiff-Warburgclique, included Morgan and Rockefeller interests. Documents show that theMorgan organization put at least $1 million in the Red revolutionary kitty.*Still another important financier of the Bolshevik Revolution was an extremelywealthy Englishman named Lord Alfred Milner, the organizer and head of a secretorganization called \"The Round Table\" Group which was backed by Lord Rothschild(discussed in the next chapter).De Goulevitch notes further:*Hagedorn, Herman, The Magnate, John Day, N.Y. See also Washington Post, Feb. 2,1918, p. 195.\"On April 7, 1917, General Janin made the following entry in his diary ('AuG.C.C. RussÃ© âAt Russian G.H.Q.âLe Monde Slave, Vol. 2, 1927, pp.296-297): Longinterview with R., who confirmed what I had previously been told by M. Afterreferring to the German hatred of himself and his family, he turned to thesubject of the Revolution which, he claimed, was engineered by the English and,more precisely, by Sir George Buchanan and Lord (Alfred) Milner. Petrograd atthe time was teeming with Englishâ¦He could, he asserted, name the streets andthe numbers of the houses in which British agents were quartered. They werereported, during the rising, to have distributed money to the soldiers andincited them to mutiny.\"De Goulevitch goes on to reveal: \"In private interviews I have been told thatover 21 million rubles were spent by Lord Milner in financing the RussianRevolution.\"It should be noted parenthetically that Lord Milner, Paul, Felix and Max Warburgrepresented \"their\" respective countries at the Paris Peace Conference at theconclusion of World War I.If we can somehow ascribe Max Warburg's financing of Lenin to German\"patriotism,\" it was certainly not \"patriotism\" which inspired Schiff, Morgan,Rockefeller and Milner to bankroll the Bolsheviks. Both Britain and America wereat war with Germany and were allies of Czarist Russia. To free dozens of Germandivisions to switch from the Eastern front to France and kill hundreds ofthousands of American and British soldiers was nothing short of treason.In the Bolshevik Revolution we see many of the same old faces that wereresponsible for creating the Federal Reserve System, initiating the graduatedincome tax, setting up the tax-free foundations and pushing us into WWI.However, if you conclude that this is anything but coincidental, your name willbe immediately expunged from the Social Register.No revolution can be successful without organization and money. \"The downtroddenmasses\" usually provide little of the former and none of the latter. ButInsiders at the top can arrange for both.What did these people possibly have to gain in financing the Russian Revolution?What did they have to gain by keeping it alive and afloat, or, during the 1920'sby pouring millions of dollars into what Lenin called his New Economic Program,thus saving the Soviets from collapse?Why would these \"capitalists\" do all this? If your goal is global conquest, youhave to start somewhere. It may or may not have been coincidental, but Russiawas the one major European country without a central bank. In Russia, for thefirst time, the Communist conspiracy gained a geographical homeland from whichto launch assaults against the other nations of the world. The West now had anenemy.In the Bolshevik Revolution we have some of the world's richest and mostpowerful men financing a movement which claims its very existence is based onthe concept of stripping of their wealth men like the Rothschilds, Rockefellers,Schiffs, Warburgs, Morgans, Harrimans, and Milners. But obviously these men haveno fear of international Communism. It is only logical to assume that if theyfinanced it and do not fear it, it must be because they control it. Can there beany other explanation that makes sense? Remember that for over 150 years it hasbeen standard operating procedure of the Rothschilds and their allies to controlboth sides of every conflict. You must have an \"enemy\" if you are going tocollect from the King. The East-West balance-of-power politics is used as one ofthe main excuses for the socialization of America. Although it was not theirmain purpose, by nationalization of Russia the Insiders bought themselves anenormous piece of real estate, complete with mineral rights, for somewherebetween $30 and $40 million.[../images/00015.jpeg]Lord Alfred Milner, wealthy Englishman and frontman for the Rothschilds, servedas paymaster for the International bankers in Petrograd during the BolshevikRevolution. Milner later headed secret society known as The Round Table whichwas dedicated to establishing a world government whereby a clique of super-richfinanciers would control the world under the guise of Socialism. The Americansubsidiary of this conspiracy is called the Council on Foreign Relations and wasstarted by, and is still controlled by Leftist international bankers. [../images/00016.jpeg]According to his grandson John, Jacob Schiff longtime associate of theRothschilds, financed the Communist Revolution in Russia to the tune of $20million. According to a report on file with the State Department, his firm, KuhnLoeb and Co. bankrolled the first five year plan for Stalin, Schiffâs partnerand relative, Paul Warburg, engineered the establishment of the Federal ReserveSystem while on the Kuhn Loeb payroll, Schiffâs descendants are active in theCouncil on Foreign Relations today. [../images/00017.jpeg]Home of the Council on Foreign Relations on 68th St. in New York. The admittedgoal of the CFR is to abolish the Constitution and replace our once independentRepublic with a World Government. CFR members have controlled the last sixadministrations. Richard Nixon has been a member and has appointed at least 100CFR members to high positions in his administration. We can only theorize on the manner in which Moscow is controlled from New York,London and Paris. Undoubtedly much of the control is economic, but certainly theinternational bankers have an enforcer arm within Russia to keep the Sovietleaders in line. The organization may be SMERSH, the international Communistmurder organization described in testimony before Congressional Committees andby Ian Fleming in his James Bond books. For although the Bond novels were wildlyimaginative, Fleming had been in British Navy intelligence, maintained excellentintelligence contacts around the world and was reputedly a keen student of theinternational conspiracy.We do know this, however. A clique of American financiers not only helpedestablish Communism in Russia, but has striven mightily ever since to keep italive. Ever since 1918 this clique has been engaged in transferring money and,probably more important, technical information, to the Soviet Union. This ismade abundantly clear in the three volume history Western Technology and SovietEconomic Development by scholar Antony Sutton of Stanford University's HooverInstitution on War, Revolution and Peace. Using, for the most part, officialState Department documents, Sutton shows conclusively that virtually everythingthe Soviets possess has been acquired from the West. It is not much of anexaggeration to say that the U.S.S.R. was made in the U.S.A. The landscapepainters, unable to refute Sutton's monumental scholarship, simply paint him outof the picture.At Versailles, this same clique carved up Europe and set the stage for World WarII. As Lord Curzon commented: \"It is not a peace treaty, it is simply a break inhostilities.\" In 1933, the same Insiders pushed FDR into recognizing the SovietUnion, thus saving it from financial collapse, while at the same time they wereunderwriting huge loans on both sides of the Atlantic for the new regime ofAdolph Hitler. In so doing they assisted greatly in setting the stage for WorldWar II, and the events that followed. In 1941, the same Insiders rushed to theaid of our \"noble ally,\" Stalin, after his break with Hitler. In 1943, thesesame Insiders marched off to the Teheran Conference and proceeded to start thecarving up of Europe after the second great \"war to end war.\" Again at Yalta andPotsdam in 1945, they established the China policyâ¦later summarized by OwenLattimore: \"The problem was how to allow them [China] to fall without making itlook as if the United States had pushed them.\" The facts are inescapable. In onecountry after another Communism has been imposed on the local population fromthe top down. The most prominent forces for the imposition of that tyranny camefrom the United States and Great Britain. Here is a charge that no Americanenjoys making, but the facts lead to no other possible conclusion. The idea thatCommunism is a movement of the downtrodden masses is a fraud.None of the foregoing makes sense if Communism really is what the Communists andthe Establishment tell us it is. But if Communism is an arm of a biggerconspiracy to control the world by power-mad billionaires (and brilliant butruthless academicians who have shown them how to use their power) it all becomesperfectly logical.It is at this point that we should again make it clear that this conspiracy isnot made up solely of bankers and international cartelists, but includes everyfield of human endeavor. Starting with Voltaire and Adam Weishaupt and runningthrough John Ruskin, Sidney Webb, Nicholas Murray Butler, and on to the presentwith Henry Kissinger and John Kenneth Galbraith, it has always been the scholarlooking for avenues of power who has shown the \"sons of the very powerful\" howtheir wealth could be used to rule the world.We cannot stress too greatly the importance of the reader keeping in mind thatthis book is discussing only one segment of the conspiracy, certaininternational bankers. Other equally important segments which work to fomentlabor, religious and racial strife in order to promote socialism have beendescribed in numerous other books. These other divisions of the conspiracyoperate independently of the international bankers in most cases and it wouldcertainly be disastrous to ignore the danger to our freedom they represent.It would be equally disastrous to lump all businessmen and bankers into theconspiracy. One must draw the distinction between competitive free enterprise,the most moral and productive system ever devised, and cartel capitalismdominated by industrial monopolists and international bankers. The difference isthe private enterpriser operates by offering products and services in acompetitive free market while the cartel capitalist uses the government to forcethe public to do business with him. These corporate socialists are the deadlyenemies of competitive private enterprise.Liberals are willing to believe that these \"robber barons\" will fix prices, rigmarkets, establish monopolies, buy politicians, exploit employees and fire themthe day before they are eligible for pensions, but they absolutely will notbelieve that these same men would want to rule the world or would use Communismas the striking edge of their conspiracy. When one discusses the machinations ofthese men, Liberals usually respond by saying, \"But don't you think they meanwell?\"However, if you think with logic, reason and precision in this field and try toexpose these power seekers, the Establishment's mass media will accuse you ofbeing a dangerous paranoid who is \"dividing\" our people. In every other area, ofcourse, they encourage dissent as being healthy in a \"democracy.\""},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5ESTABLISHING THE ESTABLISHMENT One of the primary reasons the Insiders worked behind the scenes to foment WWIwas to create in its aftermath a world government. If you wish to establishnational monopolies, you must control national governments. If you wish toestablish international monopolies or cartels, you must control a worldgovernment.After the Armistice on November 11, 1918, Woodrow Wilson and his alter ego,\"Colonel\" House (the ever present front man for the Insiders), went to Europe inhopes of establishing a world government in the form of the League of Nations.When the negotiations revealed one side had been about as guilty as the other,and the glitter of the \"moral crusade\" evaporated along with Wilson's vaunted\"Fourteen Points,\" the \"rubes back on Main Street\" began to waken. Reaction anddisillusionment set in.Americans certainly didn't want to get into a World Government withdouble-dealing Europeans whose specialty was secret treaty hidden behind secrettreaty. The guest of honor, so to speak, stalked out of the banquet before thepoisoned meal could be served. And, without American inclusion, there could beno meaningful World Government.Aroused public opinion made it obvious that the U. S. Senate dared not ratify atreaty saddling the country with such an internationalist commitment. In somemanner the American public had to be sold on the idea of internationalism andWorld Government. Again, the key was \"Colonel\" House.House had set down his political ideas in his book called Philip Dru:Administrator in 1912. In this book House laid out a thinly fictionalized planfor conquest of America by establishing \"Socialism as dreamed by Karl Marx.\" Hedescribed a \"conspiracy\" - the word is his - which succeeds in electing a U.S.President by means of \"deception regarding his real opinions and intentions.\"Among other things, House wrote that the conspiracy was to insinuate \"itselfinto the primaries, in order that no candidate might be nominated whose viewswere not in accord with theirs.\" Elections were to become mere charadesconducted for the bedazzlement of the booboisie. The idea was to use both theDemocrat and Republican parties as instruments to promote World Government.In 1919 House met in Paris with members of a British \"secret society\" called TheRound Table in order to form an organization whose job it would be topropagandize the citizens of America, England and Western Europe on the gloriesof World Government. The big selling point, of course, was \"peace.\" The partabout the Insiders establishing a world dictatorship quite naturally was leftout.The Round Table organization in England grew out of the lifelong dream of goldand diamond magnate Cecil Rhodes for a \"new world order.\"Rhodes' biographer Sara Millin was a little more direct. As she put it: \"Thegovernment of the world was Rhodes' simple desire.\" Quigley notes:\"In the middle 1890's Rhodes had a personal income of at least a million poundssterling a year (then about five million dollars) which he spent so freely forhis mysterious purposes that he was usually overdrawn on his accountâ¦\"Cecil Rhodes' commitment to a conspiracy to establish World Government was setdown in a series of wills described by Frank Aydelotte in his book AmericanRhodes Scholarships. Aydelotte writes:\"The seven wills which Cecil Rhodes made between the ages of 24 and 46 [Rhodesdied at age forty-eight] constitute a kind of spiritual autobiographyâ¦best knownare the first (the Secret Society Willâ¦.), and the last, which established theRhodes Scholarshipsâ¦In his first will Rhodes states his aim still more specifically: 'The extensionof British rule throughout the worldâ¦the foundation of so great a power as tohereafter render wars impossible and promote the interests of humanity.'The 'Confession of Faith' enlarges upon these ideas. The model for this proposedsecret society was the Society of Jesus, though he mentions also the Masons.\"It should be noted that the originator of this type of secret society was AdamWeishaupt, the monster who founded the Order of Illuminati on May 1, 1776, forthe purpose of conspiracy to control the world. The role of Weishaupt'sIlluminists in such horrors as the Reign of Terror is unquestioned, and thetechniques of the Illuminati have long been recognized as models for Communistmethodology. Weishaupt also used the structure of the Society of Jesus (theJesuits) as his model, and rewrote his Code in Masonic terms. Aydelottecontinues:\"In 1888 Rhodes made his third willâ¦leaving everything to Lord Rothschild [hisfinancier in mining enterprises], with an accompanying letter enclosing 'thewritten matter discussed between us.' This, one surmises, consisted of the firstwill and the 'Confession of Faith,' since in a postscript Rhodes says 'inconsidering questions suggested take Constitution of the Jesuits ifobtainableâ¦'\"Apparently for strategic reasons Lord Rothschild was subsequently removed fromthe forefront of the scheme. Professor Quigley reveals that Lord Rosebury\"replaced his father-in Law, Lord Rothschild, in Rhodes' secret group and wasmade a Trustee under Rhodes' next (and last), will.\"The \"secret society\" was organized on the conspiratorial pattern of circleswithin circles. Professor Quigley informs us that the central part of the\"secret society\" was established by March, 1891, using Rhodes' money. Theorganization was run for Rothschild by Lord Alfred Milner, discussed in the lastchapter as a key financier of the Bolshevik revolution. The Round Table workedbehind the scenes at the highest levels of British government, influencingforeign policy and England's involvement and conduct of WWI. According toProfessor Quigley:\"At the end of the war of 1914, it became clear that the organization of thissystem [the Round Table Group] had to be greatly extended. Once again the taskwas entrusted to Lionel Curtis who established, in England and each dominion, afront organization to the existing Round Table Group. This front organization,called the Royal Institute of International Affairs, had as its nucleus in eacharea the existing submerged Round Table Group. In New York it was known as theCouncil on Foreign Relations, and was a front for J.P. Morgan and Company inassociation with the very small American Round Table Group. The Americanorganizers were dominated by the large number of Morgan 'experts,' â¦who had goneto the Paris Peace Conference and there became close friends with the similargroup of English 'experts' which had been recruited by the Milner group. Infact, the original plans for the Royal Institute of International Affairs andthe Council on Foreign Relations [CFR] were drawn up in Parisâ¦\"Joseph Kraft (CFR), however, tells us in Harper's of July 1958, that the chiefagent in the formal founding of the Council on Foreign Relations was \"Colonel\"House, supported by such protÃ©gÃ©s as Walter Lippmann, John Foster Dulles, AllenDulles and Christian Herter. It was House who acted as host for the Round TableGroup, both English and American, at the key meeting of May 19, 1919, in theMajestic Hotel, Paris, which committed the conspiracy to creation of the CFR.Although Quigley stresses the importance of Morgan men at the creation of theorganization known as the Council on Foreign Relations, this organization's ownmaterials and \"Colonel\" House's own memoirs reveal his function as midwife atthe birth of the CFR.The CFR's Twenty-Fifth Annual Report tells us this of the CFR's founding atParis:ââ¦The Institute of International Affairs founded at Paris in 1919 was comprised,at the outset, of two branches, one in the United Kingdom and one in the U.Sâ¦.âLater the plan was changed to create an ostensible autonomy because, \"â¦it seemedunwise to set up a single institute with branches.\" It had to be made to appearthat the CFR in America, and the R.I.I.A. in Britain, were really independentbodies, lest the American public become aware the CFR was in fact a subsidiaryof the Round Table Group and react in patriotic fury.According to Quigley, the most important financial dynasties in Americafollowing WWI were (in addition to Morgan) the Rockefeller family; Kuhn, Loeb &Company; Dillon Read and Company and Brown Bros. Harriman. All were representedin the CFR and Paul Warburg was one of the incorporators. The Insider crowdwhich created the Federal Reserve System, many of whom also bankrolled theBolshevik Revolution, were all in the original membership. In addition to PaulWarburg, founders of the CFR included international financial Insiders JacobSchiff, Averell Harriman, Frank Vanderlip, Nelson Aldrich, Bernard Baruch, J.P.Morgan and John D. Rockefeller. These men did not create the CFR because theyhad nothing better to do with their time and money. They created it as a tool tofurther their ambitions.The CFR has come to be known as \"The Establishment,\" \"the invisible government\"and \"the Rockefeller foreign office.\" This semi-secret organizationunquestionably has become the most influential group in America.One of the extremely infrequent articles to appear in the national pressconcerning this Council was published in the Christian Science Monitor ofSeptember 1, 1961. It began this way:\"On the west side of fashionable Park Avenue at 68th Street [in New York City]sit two handsome buildings across the way from each other. One is the SovietEmbassy to the United Nationsâ¦Directly opposite on the southwest corner is theCouncil on Foreign Relationsâprobably one of the most influential semi-publicorganizations in the field of foreign policy.\"Although the formal membership in the CFR is composed of close to 1500 of themost elite names in the worlds of government, labor, business, finance,communications, the foundations, and the academyâand despite the fact that ithas staffed almost every key position of every administration since those ofFDRâit is doubtful that one American in a thousand so much as recognizes theCouncil's name, or that one in ten thousand can relate anything at all about itsstructure or purpose. Indicative of the CFR's power to maintain its anonymity isthe fact that, despite its having been operative at the highest levels fornearly fifty years and having from the beginning counted among its members theforemost lions of the Establishment communications media, we discovered afterporing over volumes of the Readers' Guide To Periodical Literature coveringseveral decades that only one magazine article on the CFR has ever appeared in amajor national journalâand that in Harper's, hardly a mass-circulationperiodical. Similarly, only a handful of articles on the Council have appearedin the nation's great newspapers. Such anonymityâat that levelâcan hardly be amatter of mere chance.What makes this secret organization so influential? No one who knows for acertainty will say. The Christian Science Monitor, which is edited by a memberof the American Round Table (a branch of Milner's secret society), did note inthe article of September 1, 1961, that \"its rosterâ¦contains names distinguishedin the field of diplomacy, government, business, finance, science, labor,journalism, law and education. What united so wide-ranging and disparate amembership is a passionate concern for the direction of American foreignpolicy.\"The Christian Science Monitor indicates the fantastic power the CFR has hadduring the last six administrations:\"Because of the Council's single-minded dedication to studying and deliberatingAmerican foreign policy, there is a constant flow of its members from private topublic service. Almost half of the Council members have been invited to assumeofficial government positions or to act as consultants at one time or another.\"[Emphasis added]The policies promoted by the CFR in the fields of defense and internationalrelations become, with a regularity which defies the laws of chance, theofficial policies of the United States Government. As Liberal columnist JosephKraft, himself a member of the CFR, noted of the Council in the Harper'sarticle: \"It has been the seat of some basic government decisions, has set thecontext for many more, and has repeatedly served as a recruiting ground forranking officials.\" Kraft, incidentally, aptly titled his article on the CFR,\"School for Statesmenâan admission that the members of the Council are drilledwith a \"line\" of strategy to be carried out in Washington.As World War II approached, the Round Table Group was influential in seeing thatHitler was not stopped in Austria, the Rhineland, or Sudetenlandâand thereby waslargely responsible for precipitating the holocaust. A second world war wouldgreatly enhance the opportunity for establishment of World Government. Thefinancing for Adolph Hitler's rise to power was handled through theWarburg-controlled Mendelsohn Bank of Amsterdam and later by the J. HenrySchroeder Bank with branches in Frankfurt, London and New York. Chief legalcounsel to the J. Henry Schroeder Bank was the firm of Sullivan and Cromwell,whose senior partners included John Foster and Allen Dulles. (See James Martin'sAll Honorable Men, Little Brown Co., New York, 1950, p. 51. See also Quigley,p.433.)With the Round Table doing its work in Europe, the CFR carried the ball in theUnited States. The Council's first task was to infiltrate and develop effectivecontrol of the U.S. State Departmentâto make certain that after World War IIthere would be no slip-ups as there had been following World War I. The story ofthe CFR takeover of the Department of State is contained in State DepartmentPublication 2349, Report To The President On The Results of the San FranciscoConference. It is the report of Secretary of State Edward R. Stettinius (CFR) toPresident Truman. On page twenty we find:\"With the outbreak of war in Europe it was clear that the United States would beconfronted, after the war, with new and exceptional problemsâ¦Accordingly, aCommittee on Post-War Problems was set up before the end of 1939 [two yearsbefore the U.S. entered the war], at the suggestion of the CFR. The Committeeconsisted of high officials of the Department of State [all but one of whom wereCFR members]. It was assisted by a research staff [provided by, financed by, anddirected by the CFR], which in February, 1941, was organized into a Division ofSpecial Research [and, went off the CFR payroll and onto that of the StateDepartment].[After Pearl Harbor] the research facilities were rapidly expanded, and theDepartmental Committee on Post-War Problems was reorganized into an AdvisoryCommittee on Post-War Foreign Policies [completely staffed by the CFR].\" (Seealso the CFR's booklet, A Record of Twenty Years, 1921-1947.)This is the group which designed the United Nationsâthe first major successfulstep on the road to a World Superstate. At least forty-seven CFR members wereamong the American delegates to the founding of the United Nations in SanFrancisco in 1945. Members of the CFR group included Harold Stassen, John J.McCloy, Owen Lattimore (called by the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee a\"conscious articulate instrument of the Soviet conspiracy\"), Alger Hiss(Communist spy), Philip Jessup, Harry Dexter White (Communist agent), NelsonRockefeller, John Foster Dulles, John Carter Vincent (security risk), and DeanAcheson. Just to make sure that Communist Party members understood theimportance of the U.N. establishment, Political Affairs, the Party's officialtheoretical journal, in the April 1945 issue, gave the order:\"Great popular support and enthusiasm for the United Nations policies should bebuilt-up, well-organized and fully articulate. But it is also necessary to domore than that. The opposition must be rendered so impotent that it will beunable to gather any significant support in the Senate against the UnitedNations Charter and the treaties which will follow.\"One wonders if the boobs at the Party level ever questioned why they were tosupport an organization dominated by the hated \"Wall Street\" personalities. Thelandscape painters of the mass media have outdone themselves painting the U.N.as a peace organization instead of a front for the international bankers.Not only did members of the Council on Foreign Relations dominate theestablishment of the U.N., but CFR members were at the elbow of the AmericanPresident at Teheran, Potsdam and Yaltaâwhere hundreds of millions of humanbeings were delivered into the hands of Joseph Stalin, vastly extending thepower of the International Communist Conspiracy. Administrative assistant to FDRduring this time was a key member of the CFR named Lauchlin Currieâsubsequentlyidentified by J. Edgar Hoover as a Soviet agent.So completely has the CFR dominated the State Department over the pastthirty-eight years that every Secretary of State except Cordell Hull, JamesByrnes, and William Rogers has been a member of the CFR. While Rogers is not amember, Professor Henry Kissinger, Mr. Nixon's chief foreign policy advisor,came to the job from the staff of the CFR, and the undersecretaries of state,almost to a man, are CFR members.Today the CFR remains active in working toward its final goal of a governmentover the entire worldâa government which the Insiders and their allies willcontrol. The goal of the CFR is simply to abolish the United States with itsConstitutional guarantees of liberty. And they don't even try to hide it. StudyNo.7, published by the CFR on November 25, 1959, openly advocates \"building anew international order [which] must be responsive to world aspirations forpeace, [and] for social and economic changeâ¦an international order [code wordfor world government]â¦including states labeling themselves as 'Socialist'[Communist].\"The reason is evident to those who have studied its membership for this littleknown semi-secret organization to be called \"the Establishment.\" (See Chart 7)International banking organizations that currently have men in the CFR includeKuhn, Loeb & Company; Lazard Freres (directly affiliated with Rothschild);Dillon Read; Lehman Bros.; Goldman Sachs; Chase Manhattan Bank; Morgan GuarantyBank; Brown Bros. Harriman; First National City Bank; Chemical Bank & Trust, andManufacturers Hanover Trust Bank.Among the major corporations that have men in the CFR are Standard Oil, IBM,Xerox, Eastman Kodak, Pan American, Firestone, U. S. Steel, General Electric andAmerican Telephone and Telegraph Company.Also in the CFR are men from such openly Leftist organizations as the FabianSocialist Americans for Democratic Action, the avowedly Socialist League forIndustrial Democracyâformerly the Intercollegiate Socialist Societyâand theUnited World Federalists which openly advocates world government with theCommunists. Such devotedly Socialist labor leaders as the late Walter Reuther,David Dubinsky and Jay Lovestone have also been members of the CFR. In theory,these men and organizations are supposed to be the blood enemies of the banksand businesses listed above. Yet they all belong to the same lodge. You can seewhy that fact is not advertised.The CFR is totally interlocked with the major foundations and so-called \"ThinkTanks.\" Included in the interlock are the Rockefeller, Ford and Carnegiefoundations and the Rand Corporation, Hudson Institute, Fund for the Republicand Brookings Institute \"Think Tanks.\" Chart 7World Supra-Government[../images/00018.jpeg]The fact that the CFR operates in near-complete anonymity can hardly beaccidental. Among the communications corporations represented in the CFR areNational Broadcasting Corporation, Columbia Broadcasting System, Time, Life,Fortune, Look, Newsweek, New York Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, NewYork Post, Denver Post, Louisville Courier Journal, Minneapolis Tribune, theKnight papers, McGraw-Hill, Simon & Schuster, Harper Bros., Random House, LittleBrown & Co., Macmillan Co., Viking Press, Saturday Review, Business Week andBook of the Month Club. Surely the CFR could get a few blurbs of publicity ifpublicity were desired. If it seems impossible that one entity could controlsuch a vast array of firms, it is because most people do not know that theso-called founders of such giants as the New York Times and NBC were chosen,financed and directed by Morgan, Schiff and their allies. The case of AdolphOchs of the Times and David Sarnoff of RCA are examples of this control. Bothwere given early financial aid by Kuhn, Loeb & Company and Morgan Guaranty.These are the Establishment's official landscape painters whose jobs it is tomake sure the public does not discover the CFR and its role in creating a worldsocialist dictatorship.You will recall that \"Colonel\" House believed we should have two politicalparties but only a single ideologyâOne World socialism. This is exactly what wehave in this country today. (See Chart 8) Although there are philosophicaldifferences between the grassroots Democrats and the grassroots Republicans, yetas you move up the party ladders these differences become less and lessdistinguishable until finally the ladders disappear behind the Establishment'smanaged news curtain and come together at the apex under the control of the CFR.In 1968, when George Wallace maintained that there wasn't a dime's worth ofdifference between the two parties, he may not have known how right he was orwhy.Chart 8Control of Political Parties[../images/00019.jpeg]The following are so called Democrats who have been or now are CFR agents: DeanAcheson, Alger Hiss, Adlai Stevenson, John Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, EdwardKennedy,* Averell Harriman, George Ball, Henry Fowler, Dean Rusk, AdamYarmalinsky, Hubert Humphrey, and John Lindsay. It is interesting to note that rewards of cushy jobs were given by theinternational bankers to many men high in the LBJ administration for theirservices. Undersecretary of State George Ball went with Lehman Brothers;Secretary of the Treasury Henry Fowler was taken in by Goldman, Sachs & Co.;Budget Director Peter Lewis, Undersecretary of the Treasury Frederick Deming andformer Secretary of Commerce C. R. Smith all avoided the bread lines by beingpicked up by Lazard Freres (Rothschilds). Fowler and Deming were largelyresponsible for policies which led to European nations claiming half of our gold(and having potential claims on the rest) as well as denuding the U.S. Treasuryof all of the silver reserves it had built up over a century of time. Did theinternational bankers take pity on these men for their incompetence or were theyrewarded for a job well done?Controlling the Republican Party for the CFR have been Dwight D. Eisenhower,John Foster Dulles, Thomas E. Dewey, Jacob Javits, Robert McNamara, Henry CabotLodge, Paul Hoffman, John Gardner, the Rockefeller clan, Elliott Richardson,Arthur Burns, Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon.** * Boston Committee** Richard Nixon now claims that he no longer belongs to the CFR, having droppedout when the organization became an issue in his primary campaign for thegovernorship of California in 1962. Nixon has never said why he dropped out, butthe fact that he has appointed over 110 CFR members to important positions inhis administration speaks for itself. It should come as no surprise that thevery same Richard Nixon who campaigned in 1968 as a conservative had alreadymade his real position very clear to the Insiders of the CFR by authoring anarticle in the CFR magazine, Foreign Affairs, in October 1967. The title of \"Themembers of the council [On Foreign Relations] article, \"Asia after Vietnam,\"revealed how the aspiring President Nixon would open a new policy toward RedChina and bring \"realism\" to our Asian foreign policy. The CFR's Annual Reportfor 1952 admitted that sometimes members in sensitive positions were forced togo underground and keep the membership secret. While it is true that every administration since FDR has been dominated by theCFR, the Nixon Administration has set the all-time record by appointing over 110CFR members to key positions. Henry Kissinger, the \"Colonel\" House of the NixonAdministration, came to his job directly from employment on the CFR staff.Kissinger represents the very opposite of everything Nixon said he stood for inhis campaign. Both Liberals and Conservatives admit Kissinger is by far the mostimportant man in the Nixon Administration.Administrations, both Democrat and Republican, come and goâbut the CFR lingerson. This is why the more things seem to change, the more they remain the same.The fix is in at the top, where the same coterie of Insiders, bent on control ofthe world, runs the show. As Professor Quigley admits:\"There does exist, and has existed for a generation, an internationalâ¦networkwhich operates, to some extent, in the way the radical Right believes theCommunists act. In fact, this network, which we may identify as the Round TableGroups, has no aversion to cooperating with the Communists or any other groups,and frequently does so.\" [Emphasis added.]Yes, the Insiders have no aversion to working with the Communists whoseostensible goal is to destroy them. While the Insiders are serving champagne andcaviar to their guests in their summer mansions at Newport, or entertainingother members of the social elite aboard their yachts, their agents are outenslaving and murdering people. And you are next on their list.Clearly, the Chicago Tribune's editorial of December 9, 1950, on the CFR stillapplies:\"The members of council [On Foreign Relations] are persons of much more thanaverage influence in their community. They have used the prestige that theirwealth, their social position, and their education have given them to lead theircountry toward bankruptcy and military debacle. They should look at their hands.There is blood on themâthe dried blood of the last war and the fresh blood ofthe present one [the Korean War].\"It goes without saying that the CFR's hands are bloodier now with the gore of50,000 Americans in Vietnam. Shamefully the Council has succeeded in promoting,as American policy, the shipment of American aid and trade to the East Europeanarsenal of the Viet Cong for the killing of our sons in the field.It should not be surprising to learn that there is on the international level anorganizational equivalent of the CFR. This group calls itself the Bilderbergers.If scarcely one American in a thousand has any familiarity with the CFR, it isdoubtful that one in five thousand has any knowledge of the Bilderbergers.Again, this is not accidental.The strange name of this group is taken from the site of the first meeting inMay, 1954âthe Hotel de Bilderbergâin Oosterbeek, Holland. The man who createdthe Bilderbergers is His Royal Highness Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands. ThePrince is an important figure in Royal Dutch Petroleum (Shell Oil) and theSocietÃ© GÃ©neral de Belgique, a huge conglomerate cartel with worldwide holdings.The Bilderbergers meet onceâor sometimes twiceâa year. Those in attendanceinclude leading political and financial figures from the United States andWestern Europe. Prince Bernhard makes no effort to hide the fact that theultimate goal of the Bilderbergers is a world government. In the meantime, whilethe \"new world order\" is being built, the Bilderbergers coordinate the effortsof the European and American power elites.Prince Bernhard's counterpart among the American Bilderbergers is DavidRockefeller, chairman of the board of the CFR, whose economic base is the giantChase Manhattan Bank and Standard Oil. Among the other Bilderbergers from theworld of ultra-high finance are Baron Edmund de Rothschild of the House ofRothschild, C. Douglas Dillon (CFR) of Dillon Read & Co., Robert McNamara of theWorld Bank, Sir Eric Roll of S.G. Warburg & Co., Ltd., Pierce Paul Schweitzer ofthe International Monetary Fund, and George Ball (CFR) of Lehman Brothers.Not everyone who attends one of the Bilderbergers' secret meetings is anInsider, but only men of the Left are allowed to attend the private meetingsfollowing the general sessions. The avowedly Socialist Parties of Europe arewell representedâ¦another example of the tie-in between the Insiders of highfinance and the ostensible leaders of the proletariat. Bilderberg policy is notplanned by those who attend the conferences, but by the elite steering committeeof Insiders composed of 24 Europeans and 15 Americans. Past and presentAmericans of the Bilderberger Steering Committee include George W. Ball, GardnerCowles, John H. Ferguson, Henry J. Heinz II, Robert D. Murphy, DavidRockefeller, Shepard Stone, James D. Zellerbach, Emelo G. Collado, Arthur H.Dean, Gabriel Hauge, C. D. Jackson, George Nebolsine, Dean Rusk and GeneralWalter Bedell Smith. Those who adhere to the accidental theory of history willclaim that it is sheer coincidence that every single one of those named as pastand present members of the Bilderberger Steering Committee is or was a member ofthe Council on Foreign Relations.The Bilderberger Advisory Committee forms an even more âinner circleâ' than theSteering Committee. Americans on the Advisory Committee include Joseph E.Johnson, Dean Rusk, Arthur H. Dean, George Nebolsine, John S. Coleman, GeneralWalter Bedell Smith and Henry J. Heinz II. Again, all are members of the CFR.One would assume (that is, if one had not read this book) that when the world'sleading parliamentarians and international tycoons meet to discuss the planningof their various nations' foreign policies, that the news hawks from papers andtelevisionland would be screaming to high heaven that such an event held insecret makes a mockery of the democratic process. One might expect WalterCronkite to be thundering in wrath about an elite clique meeting to plan ourlives; or the New York Times editorialists to be pounding their smokingtypewriters, fuming about \"the public's right to know.\" But, of course, thelandscape painters merely brush the Bilderbergers right out of existence andfocus the public's attention on something like the conditions in the prisons orcoke bottles littering the highways. Since the Bilderbergers are a group of theLeft (or, as the Liberals in the media might say, but don't, \"a group ofprogressives\") they are allowed to go on in peace and quiet planning for 1984.The fact that there is heavy Rockefeller (Chase Manhattan Bank and CFR)influence in the media might also have something to do with the fact that whileeverybody has heard of, say, The John Birch Society (and almost always in aderogatory manner from the Eastern Establishment media), practically nobody hasheard of the Bilderbergers.As this is written, there have been 29 Bilderberger meetings to date. Theyusually last three days and are held in remote, but plush quarters. Theparticipants are housed in one location and are protected by a thorough securitynetwork. Decisions are reached, resolutions adopted, plans of action initiated,but only Bilderbergers ever know for sure what occurred. We must assume thatthese people did not congregate merely to discuss their golf scores. The press,naturally, is not allowed to be present, although occasionally a brief pressconference is held at the end of the meeting at which time the news media aregiven in very general terms the Bilderberger version of what was discussed. Whyall the secrecy if there is really nothing to hide? Why do the Ford, Rockefellerand Carnegie foundations finance the meetings if they are not important? Yes,why?[../images/00020.jpeg]Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, head of the secret, one world Bilderbergermovement, confers with President Nixon. A former Nazi SS storm trooper (\"We hada lot of fun\"), Bernhard now works with the Rothschilds and Communists topromote a World Super State of the elite. Bernhard holds yearly secret meetingswith high U.S. officials, bankers and industrialists to map plans for mergingthe U.S. and the Soviet Union into a world government. After last meeting, Nixondevalued the dollar and opened up trade with Red China.[../images/00021.jpeg][../images/00022.jpeg]Edmond and Guy de Rothschild, leaders of the French Rothschild clan. TheRothschilds are closely connected with Prince Bernhard in business (Royal DutchShell) and in the building of a one world super government with the Soviets.Time of Dec. 20, 1963, says of Guy: \"Guy is every inch a Rothschild. Hepersonifies much of what the family name stands forâ¦He is a friend andconfidante of some of France's politiciansâ¦ Most of all, he is dedicated toenlarging the fortune of his bankâ¦ Guy heads a versatile clan of modern dayRothschilds.\" Edmond, reputedly the richest of the French Rothschilds, is worth$500 million personally, according to estimates.The most recent meeting took place at Laurance Rockefeller's Woodstock Inn atWoodstock, Vermont, April 23, 24, 25, 1971. Apparently the only newspaper tocarry a substantial story on the meeting was the Rutland, Vermont, Herald, whosereporter could acquire only sketchy information about what the meeting was allabout. The April 20, 1971 issue of the Herald reported:\"A rather tight lid of secrecy was being kept on the conferenceâ¦A closed-doormeeting was held in Woodstock last week to brief a handful of local officials onsome phases of the conference. One participant of the meeting insisted Mondaythat the officials were told the meeting would be an 'international peaceconference.' However, other reliable sources said the conference will deal withinternational financeâ¦The Woodstock Inn will apparently be sealed up like Fort Knoxâ¦No press coveragewill be allowed, with the exception of issuing a statement at the close of themeeting on Sunday.\"When Prince Bernhard arrived at Boston's Logan Airport, he did admit toreporters that the subject of the conference would be the \"change in theworld-role of the United States.\" Isn't it nice to have changes in America'srole in the world decided upon by Bernhard, Rothschild and Rockefeller? There isreal democracy in action, as they say. Present at the scene to carry back ordersto Mr. Nixon was CFR-Rockefeller errand boy, the President's Number One advisoron foreign affairs, Henry Kissinger. Shortly after the Woodstock meeting, twoominous and \"role changing\" events occurred: Henry Kissinger went to Peking andarranged for the acceptance of Red China as a member of the family of tradingnations; and an international monetary crisis developed after which the dollarwas devalued. As the British statesman and Rothschild confidante BenjaminDisraeli wrote in Coningsby: \"So you see, my dear Coningsby, that the world isgoverned by very different personages from what is imagined by those who are notbehind the scenes.\""},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6THE ROCKEFELLERS AND THE REDS The most important American of those \"different personages\" who run the worldfrom behind the scenes are the Rockefellers. The Rockefeller clan reportedly hasworked with the Rothschilds and their agents since the 1880's when the originalJohn D. arranged to get a rebate on every barrel of oil he and his competitorsshipped over Kuhn, Loeb & Co.-controlled Pennsylvania and Baltimore & Ohiorailroads. It has been a profitable partnership ever since, although thereappear to have been areas in which the two financial dynasties competed.The involvement of the Rockefellers with their supposed blood enemies, theCommunists, dates back to the Bolshevik Revolution. During the 1920's Leninestablished his New Economic Policy (the same name Mr. Nixon applied to hiswage- price control package), when the supposedly hated capitalists were invitedback into Russia.The Federal Reserve-CFR Insiders began pushing to open up Communist Russia toU.S. traders soon after the revolution. However, at that time public opinion ranso high against the Bolsheviks because of their barbarism that it was officialU.S. government policy not to deal with the outlaw government. The U.S. did notofficially recognize the Bolsheviks until 1933. In the meantime, the Sovieteconomy was in a shambles and the people were starving to death. Communism wouldhave collapsed had it not been aided by the Insiders. The Bolsheviks wereoriginally saved from collapse by Herbert Hoover (CFR) who raised money to buyfood which was appropriated by Lenin and his gangsters. They used it as a toolto subdue starving peasants who had been resisting their newly imposed slavemasters. While Hoover's \"humanitarian\" gesture saved the Soviet regime, theRussian economy was still in total chaos. In came the Vanderlips, Harrimans andRockefellers. One of the first to jump in was Frank Vanderlip, an agent of theRockefellers and one of the Jekyll Island conspirators, president of theRockefeller First National City Bank, who compared Lenin to George Washington.(Louis Budenz, The Bolshevik Invasion of The West, Bookmailer, p.115)The Rockefellers assigned their public relations agent, Ivy Lee, to sell theAmerican public the idea that the Bolsheviks were merely misunderstood idealistswho were actually kind benefactors of mankind.Professor Antony Sutton of Stanford University's Hoover Institution, notes inhis highly authoritative Western Technology and Soviet Economic Development:\"Quite predictably, 180 pages later, Lee concludes that the communist problem ismerely psychological. By this time he is talking about 'Russians' (notCommunists) and concludes 'they are all right.' He suggests the United Statesshould not engage in propaganda; makes a plea for peaceful coexistence; andsuggests the United States would find it sound policy to recognize the USSR andadvance credits.\" (Antony Sutton, Western Technology and Soviet EconomicDevelopment, 1917-1930, Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace,Stanford University, Calif., 1968, p.292)After the Bolshevik Revolution, Standard Oil of New Jersey bought 50 percent ofthe Nobel's huge Caucasus oil fields even though the property had theoreticallybeen nationalized. (O'Connor, Harvey, The Empire Of Oil, Monthly Review Press,New York, 1955, p.270.)In 1927, Standard Oil of New York built a refinery in Russia; thereby helpingthe Bolsheviks put their economy back on its feet. Professor Sutton states:\"This was the first United States investment in Russia since the Revolution.\"(Ibid, Vol. 1, p.38)Shortly thereafter Standard Oil of New York and its subsidiary, Vacuum OilCompany, concluded a deal to market Soviet oil in European countries and it wasreported that a loan of $75,009,000 to the Bolsheviks was arranged. (NationalRepublic, Sept. 1927.)We have been unable to find out if Standard Oil was even theoreticallyexpropriated by the Communists. Sutton writes:\"Only the Danish telegraph concessions, the Japanese fishing, coal and oilconcessions, and the Standard Oil lease remained after 1935.\" (Ibid, Vol. II,p.17.)Wherever Standard Oil would go, Chase National Bank was sure to follow. (TheRockefeller's Chase Bank was later merged with the Warburg's Manhattan Bank toform the present Chase Manhattan Bank.) In order to rescue the Bolsheviks, whowere supposedly an archenemy, the Chase National Bank was instrumental inestablishing the American-Russian Chamber of Commerce in 1922. President of theChamber was Reeve Schley, a vice-president of Chase National Bank. (Ibid, Vol.II, p.288) According to Professor Sutton: \"In 1925, negotiations between Chaseand Prombank extended beyond the finance of raw materials and mapped out acomplete program for financing Soviet raw material exports to the U.S. andimports of U.S. cotton and machinery. (Ibid, Vol. II, p.226) Sutton also reportsthat \"Chase National Bank and the Equitable Trust Company were leaders in theSoviet credit business.\" (Ibid, p.277)The Rockefeller's Chase National Bank also was involved in selling Bolshevikbonds in the United States in 1928. Patriotic organizations denounced the Chaseas an \"international fence.\" Chase was called \"a disgrace to Americaâ¦ They willgo to any lengths for a few dollars profits.\" (Ibid, Vol. II, p.291) CongressmanLouis McFadden, chairman of the House Banking Committee, maintained in a speechto his fellow Congressmen:\"The Soviet government has been given United States Treasury funds by theFederal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Banks acting through the ChaseBank and the Guaranty Trust Company and other banks in New York City.Open up the books of Amtorg, the trading organization of the Soviet governmentin New York, and of Gostorg, the general office of the Soviet TradeOrganization, and of the State Bank of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republicsand you will be staggered to see how much American money has been taken from theUnited States' Treasury for the benefit of Russia. Find out what business hasbeen transacted for the State Bank of Soviet Russia by its correspondent, theChase Bank of New Yorkâ¦.â (Congressional Record, June 15, 1933.)But the Rockefellers apparently were not alone in financing the Communist arm ofthe Insiders' conspiracy. According to Professor Sutton \"â¦there is a report inthe State Department files that names Kuhn, Loeb & Co. (the long established andimportant financial house in New York) as the financier of the First Five YearPlan. See U.S. State Dept. Decimal File, 811.51/3711 and 861.50 FIVE YEARPLAN/236.\" (Sutton, op. cit., Vol. II, p. 340.)Professor Sutton proves conclusively in his three volume history of Soviettechnological development that the Soviet Union was almost literallymanufactured by the U.S.A. Sutton quotes a report by Averell Harriman to theState Department in June, 1944 as stating:\"Stalin paid tribute to the assistance rendered by the United States to Sovietindustry before and during the war. He said that about two-thirds of all thelarge industrial enterprise in the Soviet Union had been built with UnitedStates help or technical assistance.\" (Sutton, op. cit., Vol. II, p.3.)Remember that this was at a time when the Soviets had already established anextensive spy network in the U.S. and the Communist Daily Worker newspaperregularly called for the destruction of our liberty and the Sovietizing ofAmerica.Sutton shows that there is hardly a segment of the Soviet economy which is not aresult of the transference of Western, particularly American, technology.This cannot be wholly the result of accident. For fifty years the FederalReserve - CFR - Rockefeller - Insider crowd has advocated and carried outpolicies aimed at increasing the power of their satellite, the Soviet Union.Meanwhile, America spends $75 billion a year on defense to protect itself fromthe enemy the Insiders are building up.What has been true of the past is even more valid today. The leader in promotingthe transfer of technology and increasing aid and trade with the Communists isthe Council on Foreign Relations.On October 7, 1966, President Lyndon Johnson, a man who had appointed a CFRmember to virtually every strategic position in his administration, stated:\"We intend to press for legislative authority to negotiate trade agreementswhich could extend most favored-nation tariff treatment to European Communiststatesâ¦We will reduce export controls on East-West trade with respect to hundreds ofnon-strategic itemsâ¦\"The New York Times reported one week later on October 13, 1966:\"The United States put into effect today one of President Johnson's proposalsfor stimulating East-West trade by removing restrictions on the export of morethan four hundred commodities to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europeâ¦Among the categories from which items have been selected for export relaxationare vegetables, cereals, fodder, hides, crude and manufactured rubber, pulp andwaste paper, textiles and textile fibers, crude fertilizers, metal ores andscrap, petroleum, gas and derivatives, chemical compounds and products, dyes,medicines, fireworks, detergents, plastic materials, metal products andmachinery, and scientific and professional instruments.\"Virtually every one of these \"non-strategic\" items has a direct or indirect usein war. Later, items such as rifle cleaning compounds, electronic equipment andradar were declared \"non-strategic\" and cleared for shipment to the SovietUnion. The trick simply is to declare almost everything \"non-strategic.\" Amachine gun is still considered strategic and therefore may not be shipped tothe Communists, but the tools for making the machine guns and the chemicals topropel the bullets have been declared \"non-strategic.\" Meanwhile, nearly 50,000Americans have died in Vietnam. The Viet Cong and North Vietnamese receive 85percent of their war materials from Russia and the Soviet bloc nations. Sincetheir economies are incapable of supporting a war, the Communist arm of theconspiracy needed help from the Finance Capitalist arm. The United States hasbeen financing and equipping both sides of the terrible Vietnamese war, killingour own soldiers by proxy. Again, the landscape painters in the mass media havekept the American public from learning this provable fact.Not surprisingly, the Rockefellers have been leaders in championing this bloodytrade. On January 16, 1967, one of the most incredible articles ever to appearin a newspaper graced the front page of the Establishment's daily, the New YorkTimes. Under the headline \"Eaton Joins Rockefellers To Spur Trade With Reds\" thearticle stated:\"An alliance of family fortunes linking Wall Street and the Midwest is going totry to build economic bridges between the free world and Communist Europe.The International Basic Economy Corporation, controlled by the Rockefellerbrothers, and Tower International, Inc., headed by Cyrus S. Eaton Jr., Clevelandfinancier, plan to cooperate in promoting trade between the Iron Curtaincountries, including the Soviet Unionâ¦\"International Basic Economy Corporation (IBEC) is run by Richard Aldrich,grandson of Federal Reserve plotter Nelson Aldrich, and Rodman Rockefeller(CFR), Rockyâs son. On October 20, 1969, IBEC announced that N. M. Rothschild &Sons of London had entered into partnership with the firm.Cyrus Eaton Jr. is the son of the notoriously pro-Soviet Cyrus Eaton, who beganhis career as secretary to John D. Rockefeller. It is believed that Eaton's riseto power in finance resulted from backing by his mentor. The agreement betweenTower International and IBEC continues an old alliance. Although Eaton's namedoes not appear on the CFR's membership rolls, the Reece Committee whichinvestigated foundations for Congress in 1953, found that Eaton was a secretmember.Among the \"non-strategic\" items which the Rockefeller Eaton axis is going tobuild for the Communists are ten rubber goods plants, including two syntheticrubber plants worth $200 million. Mr. Eaton explains in the Times article:\"These people are setting up new automobile plants and know they have got tohave tire factories.\" Under the Nixon Administration which, contrary to campaignpromises, has multiplied trade with the Reds tenfold, American concerns arebuilding the world's largest truck factory for the Communists. Trucks arenecessary for a nation's war machine and truck factories can be converted to theproduction of tanks as was done during WWII. The U.S. will provide the Sovietswith both the facilities to build the trucks and the tires (or tank treads) forthem to roll on.In addition, the Rockefellers and Eatons are constructing a $50 million aluminumproducing plant for the Reds. Aluminum for jet planes is considered\"non-strategicâ under Johnson-Nixon doctrine.Even more incredibly, the Times reveals:\"Last month, Tower International reached a tentative agreement with the Sovietpatent and licensing organization, Licensintorg, covering future licensing andpatent transactions. Until now, Mr. Eaton said, the Russians have left thebuying and selling of licenses and patents to the Amtorg Trading Corporation,the official Soviet agency in this country for promoting Soviet-American trade.\"This means that the Rockefellers and Eatons have a monopoly on the transfer oftechnological capability to the supposed enemies of the super-rich, the SovietUnion. According to the Times:\"Mr. Eaton acknowledged the difficulties that Amtorg's representatives hadencountered here in trying to arrange licensing agreements with Americancompanies. 'As you can imagine,' he said, 'it is almost impossible for a Russianto walk into the research department of an American aerospace company and try toarrange the purchase of a patent'.\" [../images/00023.jpeg][../images/00024.jpeg][../images/00025.jpeg]Nikita Khrushchev, the infamous âButcher of Budapestâ, Nelson Rockefeller, andCyrus Eaton (left to right).When Communist dictators visit the U.S. they do not visit the laborers or unionleaders, but hobnob with industrial leaders. There is little, if any, attempt bythe Red dictators to identify with the working class.The avowedly pro-Communist industrialist Cyrus Eaton started his business careeras secretary to John D. Rockefeller and the Rockefeller family is believed to belargely responsible for his fortune.The Rockefeller and Eaton families have now joined forces to build warproduction plants behind the Iron Curtain so that the Communists can become abigger threat to U.S. survival. America spends $70 billion a year ostensibly ondefense and then the Rockefellers build aluminum mills for the Communists. Onlythe absence of a formal declaration of war in Vietnam keeps the Eatons andRockefellers from being actionable for treason. They have the blood of nearly50,000 American servicemen on their hands.Certainly every loyal American will say to himself, \"Well, I would hope to Godthe Soviets couldn't walk into our defense plants and buy a patent.\" TheRockefellers and the Eatons have solved that problem for the Communists. Now,instead of dealing with an official agency of the Soviet government, Americanconcerns will be dealing with the Rockefellers. Meanwhile, nearly 50,000Americans have died in Vietnam, many of them killed by weapons which theRockefellers directly or indirectly supplied to our avowed enemies. Only thetechnicality of the lack of a formal declaration of war prevents theRockefellers' trading in the blood of dead Americans from being actionable astreason.Thus by the purchase of patents for the Communists the Rockefellers arevirtually in charge of research and development for the Soviet military machine,allowing the Soviets to mass produce American developments. The transfer of suchknowledge is even more important than the sale of weapons. A process that mayhave taken an American corporation a decade to develop is transferred in toto tothe Communists. Does it make sense to spend $75 billion a year on nationaldefense and then deliberately increase the war-making potential of an avowedenemy? It does to Mr. Rockefeller and the Insiders.Since the Rockefellers have contracted to arrange for patents for the Soviets,they are by dictionary definition Communist agents. Would it not be moreaccurate to define the Communists as Rockefeller agents?Indicative of this was a strange event which occurred in October of 1964. DavidRockefeller, president of the Chase Manhattan Bank and chairman of the board ofthe Council on Foreign Relations, took a vacation in the Soviet Union. This is apeculiar place for the world's greatest \"imperialist\" to take his vacation sincemuch of Communist propaganda deals with taking all of David's wealth away fromhim and distributing it to \"the people.\" A few days after Rockefeller ended his\"vacation\" in the Kremlin, Nikita Khrushchev was recalled from a vacation at aBlack Sea resort to learn that he had been fired. How strange! As far as theworld knew, Khrushchev was the absolute dictator of the Soviet government and,more important, head of the Communist Party which runs the USSR. Who has thepower to fire the man who was supposedly the absolute dictator? Did DavidRockefeller journey to the Soviet Union to fire an employee? Obviously theposition of premier in the Soviet Union is a figurehead with the true powerresiding elsewhere. Perhaps in New York.For five decades the Communists have based their propaganda on the theme thatthey were going to destroy the Rockefellers and the other super-rich. Yet wefind that for five decades the Rockefellers have been involved in building thestrength of the Soviets. We are supposed to believe those internationalcartelists do this because they are foolish or greedy. Does this make sense? Ifa criminal goes up and down the streets shouting at the top of his lungs that assoon as he gets hold of a gun he is going to kill Joe Doaks, and you learn thatDoaks is secretly giving guns to the criminal, one of two things must be true.Either Doaks is a fool or all the shouting is just \"show biz\" and the criminalsecretly works for Doaks. The Rockefellers are not fools.While David runs the financial end of the Rockefeller dynasty, Nelson runs thepolitical. Nelson would like to be President of the United States. But,unfortunately for him, he is unacceptable to the vast majority of the grassroots of his own party. The next best thing to being President is controlling aPresident. Nelson Rockefeller and Richard Nixon are supposed to be bitterpolitical competitors. In a sense they are, but that still does not precludeRockefeller from asserting dominion over Mr. Nixon. When Mr. Nixon and Mr.Rockefeller competed for the Republican nomination in 1968, Rockefellernaturally would have preferred to win the prize, but regardless of who won, hewould control the highest office in the land.You will recall that right in the middle of drawing up the Republican platformin 1960, Mr. Nixon suddenly left Chicago and flew to New York to meet withNelson Rockefeller in what Barry Goldwater described as the \"Munich of theRepublican Party.\" There was no political reason why Mr. Nixon needed to crawlto Mr. Rockefeller. He had the convention all sewed up. The Chicago Tribunecracked that it was like Grant surrendering to Lee.In The Making of the President, 1960, Theodore White noted that Nixon acceptedall the Rockefeller terms for this meeting, including provisions \"that Nixontelephone Rockefeller personally with his request for a meeting; that they meetat the Rockefeller apartmentâ¦that their meeting be secret and later be announcedin a press release from the Governor, not Nixon; that the meeting be clearlyannounced as taking place at the Vice President's request; that the statement ofpolicy issuing from it be long, detailed, inclusive, not a summary communiquÃ©.\"The meeting produced the infamous \"Compact of Fifth Avenue\" in which theRepublican Platform was scrapped and replaced by Rockefeller's socialist plans.The Wall Street Journal of July 25, 1960, commented: \"â¦a little band ofconservatives within the partyâ¦are shoved to the sidelinesâ¦ [T]he fourteenpoints are very liberal indeed; they comprise a platform akin in many ways tothe Democratic platform and they are a far cry from the things that conservativemen think the Republican Party ought to stand forâ¦\" As Theodore White put it:\"Never had the quadrennial liberal swoop of the regulars been more nakedlydramatized than by the open compact of Fifth Avenue. Whatever honor they mighthave been able to carry from their services on the platform committee had beenwiped out. A single night's meeting of the two men in a millionaire's triplexapartment in Babylon-by-the-Hudson, eight hundred and thirty miles away, wasabout to overrule them; they were exposed as clowns for all the world to see.\"The whole story behind what happened in Rockefeller's apartment will doubtlessnever be known. We can only make an educated guess in light of subsequentevents. But it is obvious that since that time Mr. Nixon has been in theRockefeller orbit.After losing to Kennedy by an eyelash, Mr. Nixon, against his wishes, and at therequest (or order) of Rockefeller, entered the California gubernatorial race andlost. (For further details see the author's Richard Nixon: The Man Behind TheMask.) After losing to Pat Brown in the California gubernatorial race in 1962,Nixon had universally been consigned to the political trash heap. He left hispractice as an attorney in California and went to New York, where he moved in asa neighbor of Nelson Rockefeller, the man who is supposedly his archenemy, in a$100,000-a-year apartment in a building owned by Rockefeller. Then Mr. Nixonwent to work for the law firm of Mr. Rockefeller's personal attorney, JohnMitchell, and in the next six years spent most of his time touring the countryand the world, first rebuilding his political reputation and then campaigning toget the 1968 Republican nomination. At the same time, according to his ownfinancial statement, his net worth multiplied many times and he became quitewealthy. Nelson Rockefeller, (and his colleagues of the Eastern LiberalEstablishment), who helped make Nixon acceptable to Conservatives by appearingto oppose him, rescued Nixon from political oblivion and made him President ofthe United States. Does it not make sense that Mr. Nixon, the man of passionateambition whose career had sunk to the bottom, had to make some deals in order toreach his goal? And did he not acquire massive political debts in return forbeing made President by the Eastern Liberal Establishment?When Nixon left Washington, he, by his own claim, had little more than an oldOldsmobile automobile, Pat's respectable Republican cloth coat, and a governmentpension. While in law practice Nixon had an income of $200,000 per year, ofwhich more than half went to pay for the apartment in Rocky's building. By 1968,he reported his net worth as $515,830, while assigning a value of only $45,000to his partnership in his increasingly flourishing law firm. It may be that thefrugal Mr. Nixon acquired the after-tax investment capital that mushroomed into$858,190 in assets by faithfully plugging his change into a piggy bank. Thenagain, it may have been part of Nixon's deal with Rockefeller and the Insidersthat Mr. Nixon's personal poverty problems should be solved. The President isobviously an un-free agent.The man most observers agree is the most powerful man in the Administration ondomestic policy matters is Attorney General John Mitchell. Mitchell, who hadbeen a Nixon law partner, served as campaign manager in 1968, and reportedlywill serve in that capacity in 1972. The Wall Street Journal of January 17,1969, revealed that Mitchell was Rocky's personal lawyer. The Establishment'slandscape painters have etched a picture of Mitchell as a tough cop-typeconservative bent; it appears that in reality Mitchell is but anotherRockefeller agent.Richard Nixon was elected President on a platform which promised to stopAmerica's retreat before world Communism. Yet he appointed Henry Kissinger, aman who represented the opposite of the stands Mr. Nixon took during hiscampaign, to a position which is virtually Assistant President. Is it surprisingthen that Mr. Nixon has done just the opposite of what he promised he would doduring his 1968 campaign?How did Mr. Nixon come to pick an ultra-liberal to be his number one foreignpolicy advisor? We are told by Time magazine that Mr. Nixon met Kissinger at acocktail party given by Clare Boothe Luce during the Christmas holidays in 1967.Mr. Nixon is supposed to have been so impressed by Dr. Kissinger's cocktailparty repartee that he appointed him to the most powerful position in the NixonAdministration. Mr. Nixon would have to be stupid to have done that; and Mr.Nixon is not stupid. The Kissinger appointment was arranged by NelsonRockefeller. (Salt Lake City Desert News, March 27, 1970.) Kissinger had servedfor five years as Rockefeller's personal advisor on foreign affairs and at thetime of his appointment he was serving as a paid staff member of the Council onForeign Relations.Mr. Nixon's fantastic about face was praised by LBJ in the Washington Star ofDec. 1, 1971. The paper states:\"Former President Lyndon B. Johnson acknowledges that Richard Nixon, as aRepublican President, has been able to accomplish some things that a DemocraticPresident could not haveâ¦â\"'Can't you just see the uproar,â he asked during a recent interview, âif I hadbeen responsible for Taiwan getting kicked out of the United Nations? Or if Ihad imposed sweeping national controls on prices and wages?â\"'Nixon has gotten by with it,â he observed, an appreciative tone in his voice.âIf I had tried to do it, or Truman, or Humphrey, or any Democrat, we would havebeen clobbered.'\" [../images/00026.jpeg]Nelson Rockefeller and Richard Nixon are theoretically political enemies, butRocky arranged '68 election so that if he could not be President, someone whomhe controlled would be. The Rockefeller family through their Chase ManhattanBank and other entities has been great benefactors of the Soviet Union eversince Communist Revolution in Russia. During his campaign Nixon promised to haltshipment of war materials from America to North Vietnam via European Communistbloc because these supplies were being used to kill American soldiers. But muchof this bloc trade is controlled by Rockefellers and Nixon has reversed himselfand greatly multiplied such trade. The press, quite naturally, remains silentabout killing American soldiers by proxy. [../images/00027.jpeg]The boss and his two employees â the three musketeers of the CFRâRocky,President Nixon and Henry Kissinger. Kissinger of Harvard was made â virtualAssistant President by Rockefeller on whose staff he had served for a dozenyears. Kissinger also had been on the staff of the CFR just prior to joining theNixon Administration. Kissinger was the very embodiment of everything Nixondenounced during his '68 campaign. This explains why Nixon has reversed himselfon so many stands. Among those to hail Mr. Nixon's move to the Left is AlgerHiss, the Communist spy Richard Nixon helped convict (Chicago Tribune, Oct.25,1971). It was the Hiss Case which catapulted Nixon â from obscurity into theSenate, the Vice Presidency, and eventually, the White House."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7PRESSURE FROM ABOVE ANDPRESSURE FROM BELOW The Establishment's official landscape artists have done a marvelous job ofpainting a picture of Richard Nixon as a conservative. Unfortunately, thispicture is twenty years out of date. The very liberal Senator Hugh Scott ofPennsylvania boasted to a reporter one day: \"[Liberals] get the action and theConservatives get the rhetoric.\" Richard Nixon could not have been elected hadhe run as a Rockefeller liberal, but he can get away with running hisAdministration like one simply because the landscape painters fail to call thepublic's attention to the fact. However, columnist Stewart Alsop in writing fora sophisticated audience of approving Liberals, reveals the real Nixon. Alsopclaims that if Nixon were judged by his deeds instead of his ancient image, theLiberals' attitude toward him would be different. If only the Liberals'Pavlovian response to the Nixon name could be eliminated, says Alsop, they wouldrealize how far Left he is. Therefore Alsop substitutes a hypothetical\"President Liberal\" for President Nixon:\"â¦If President Liberal were actually in the White House, it is not at all hardto imagine the reaction to his program. The right would be assailing PresidentLiberal for bugging out of Vietnam, undermining American defenses, fiscalirresponsibility, and galloping socialism. The four basic Presidential policypositions listed above would be greeted with hosannas by the liberalsâ¦âInstead, the liberals have showered the President with dead cats, while mostconservatives have maintained a glum silence, and thus the Administration hasbeen 'little credited' for 'much genuine achievement.' But there are certainspecial reasons, which Pat Moynihan omitted to mention, why this is so.\"Alsop further explains how having the reputation of being an enemy of theLiberal Democrats helps Nixon pass their program:\"For one thing, there is a sort of unconscious conspiracy between the Presidentand his natural enemies, the liberal Democrats, to conceal the extent to whichhis basic program, leaving aside frills and rhetoric, is really the liberalDemocratic program. Richard Nixon is the first professional politician and 'realRepublican' to be elected President in 40 yearsâand it is not in theself-interest of the liberals to give credit to such a President for liberalinitiatives. By the same token, it is not in the self-interest of the Presidentto risk his conservative constituency by encouraging the notion that he is not a'real Republican' after all, but a liberal Democrat at cut ratesâ¦There are plenty of examples of the mutual obfuscation which results from thismutual interest. The withdrawal of half a million men from Vietnam is quiteobviously the greatest retreat in American history. But the President talks asthough it were somehow a glorious advance, certain to guarantee a 'just andlasting peace.' When the President-like any commander of a retreat-resorts tospoiling actions to protect his dwindling rear guard, the liberals howl that heis 'chasing the will-o'-the-wisp of military victory.'â¦When the President cuts back real military strength more sharply than in aquarter of a century, the liberals attack him for failing to 'reorderpriorities.' The President, in his rhetoric about a 'strong defense,' plays thesame game. The result, as John Kenneth Galbraith accurately noted recently, isthat 'most people and maybe most congressmen think the Administration isindulging the Pentagon even more than the Democrats,' which is the preciseopposite of the truthâ¦\"Alsop continued what is probably the most damning column ever written aboutRichard Nixon by noting the role that the mass media have played in portrayingto the public an image that is the reverse of the truth:\"â¦There is also a human element in this exercise in mutual obfuscation. To theliberals, especially the liberal commentators who dominate the media, RichardNixon is Dr. Fell ('The reason why I cannot tell, but this I know and know fullwell, I do not like thee, Dr. Fell.'). This is not surprising. Not too manyyears ago, Richard M. Nixon was one of the most effectiveâand least lovableâofthe conservative Republican professionals of the McCarthy era.\"The columnist, himself a member of the socialist Americans for Democratic Action(ADA), speculated on what the \"old Nixon\" would have had to say about the \"newNixon\":\"â¦on his past record, it is not at all hard to imagine R.M. Nixon leading theassault on the President for his 'bug-out,' 'fiscal irresponsibility,''galloping socialism,' and all the rest of it. So how can one expect Mr. Nixonto defend President Liberal's program with the passionate conviction that aPresident Robert Kennedy, say, would have brought to the defense of such aprogram?\"Alsop has revealed the real Nixon and is obviously pleased. Those who voted forNixon shouldn't be quite so happy. If you liked the Richard Nixon who ran forthe Presidency, then you cannot, if you are consistent, like the Richard Nixonwho is President. Nixon and his fellow \"moderates\" have turned the Republicanelephant into a donkey in elephant's clothing. On June 19, 1959, Vice PresidentNixon gloated: \"In summary, the Republican administration produced the thingsthat the Democrats promised.\" It looks as if it's happening again!A year and a half earlier Nixon had been warbling a different tune:\"If we have nothing to offer other than a pale carbon copy of the New Deal, ifour only purpose is to gain and retain power, the Republican Party no longer hasany reason to exist, and it ought to go out of business.\"The Nixon \"Game Plan,\" as Harvard Professor John Kenneth Galbraith gleefullypoints out, is SOCIALISM. The Nixon \"Game Plan\" is infinitely more clever anddangerous than those of his predecessors because it masquerades as being theopposite of what it is.Mr. Nixon is aware that most Americans fear \"big government.\" An August 1968,Gallup Poll showed that 46 percent of the American public believed that \"biggovernment\" was the \"biggest threat to the country.\" Gallup commented: \"Althoughbig government has been a favorite Republican target for many years, rank andfile democrats are nearly as critical of growing Federal power as areRepublicans.\" Recognizing this attitude, Mr. Nixon geared much of his campaignrhetoric to attacking Big Daddy government. However, the Nixon Administrationhas taken massive steps to further concentrate authority in the federal \"powerpinnacle.\" (See Chart 3, p.36)While centralizing power at a rate which would have made Hubert Humphrey blush,Mr. Nixon has continued to pay lip service to decentralization. During the firstyear of his Administration Mr. Nixon announced his \"New Federalism\" (the nametaken from the title of a book by Nelson Rockefeller). The first part of the\"New Federalism\" is the Family Assistance Program (FAP) which would, contrary tohis campaign promises, provide a Guaranteed Annual Income. Based on suggestionsfrom John Gardner of file CFR and Daniel Moynihan, a member of the board ofdirectors of the socialist ADA, the FAP would double the number on welfare andincrease tremendously the power of the executive branch of the federalgovernment. The Leftwing weekly, the New Republic, cheered the proposal as\"creeping socialism.\"The second major segment of the President's \"New Federalism\" is revenue sharingwith the states, touted as a step in the decentralization of power from thefederal government. Actually, the program does just the opposite. The money mustfirst go from the states to Washington before it can be shared. As columnistJames J. Kilpatrick remarked: \"â¦power to control follows the Federal dollar assurely as that famous lamb accompanied little Mary.\" As soon as the states andlocal governments get hooked on the federal funds, the controls will be put onjust as they were in education and agriculture. Every field the governmentattempts to take over it first subsidizes. You can't decentralize government bycentralizing the tax collections.Mr. Nixon's \"power to the people\" slogan really means \"power to the President.\"House Ways and Means Chairman Wilbur Mills has called the revenue-sharing plan a\"trap\" that \"could become a massive weapon against the independence of state andlocal government.\" The plan, said Mills, \"goes in the direction of centralizedgovernment.\"But, Mr. Nixon is very clever. In his 1971 State of the Union Message, the talkin which he used the Communist slogan \"Power to the People,\" the President said:\"We in Washington will at last be able to provide government that is truly forthe people. I realize that what I am asking is that not only the Executivebranch in Washington, but that even this Congress will have to change by givingup some of its power.\"That sounds reasonable doesn't it? The Executive branch will give up some powerand the Congress will give up some power and the people will gain by havingthese powers returned to them. Right? Wrong! That is nothing but verbal sleightof hand. Notice the precision of Mr. Nixon's language. He speaks of the\"Executive branch in Washington\" giving up some of its power. Three days laterit became obvious why Mr. Nixon added the seemingly redundant \"in Washington\"when it was announced that the country was being carved up into ten federaldistricts. These federal districts would soon, be used to administer the wageand price controls which centralize in the federal government almost total powerover the economy.To many political observers the most shocking development of the past year wasthe admission by President Richard Nixon to newsman Howard K. Smith that he is\"now a Keynesian in economics.\" The jolted Smith commented later, \"That's alittle like a Christian Crusader saying: 'All things considered, I thinkMohammed was right.'\" Howard K. Smith was well aware that such a statement wastantamount to a declaration by Mr. Nixon that \"I am now a Socialist.\" JohnMaynard Keynes, the English economist and Fabian Socialist, bragged that he waspromoting the \"euthanasia of capitalism.\"It is generally believed in England among students of this conspiracy that JohnMaynard Keynes produced his General Theory of Money and Credit at the behest ofcertain Insiders of international finance who hired him to concoct apseudo-scientific justification for government deficit spendingâjust as themysterious League of Just Men had hired Karl Marx to write the CommunistManifesto. The farther a government goes into debt, the more interest is paid tothe powerful Insiders who \"create\" money to buy government bonds by the simpleexpedient of bookkeeping entries. Otherwise, you can bet your last farthing thatthe Insiders of international banking would be violently opposed to inflationarydeficits.In his internationally syndicated column of February 3, 1971, James Reston (CFR)exclaimed:\"The Nixon budget is so complex, so unlike the Nixon of the past, soun-Republican that it defies rational analysisâ¦ The Nixon budget is moreplanned, has more welfare in it, and has a bigger predicted deficit than anyother budget of this century.\"During 1967, while on the primary trail, Richard Nixon made exorbitant Democratspending his Number Two campaign issue, just behind the failure of the Democratsto win the Vietnam War. Mr. Johnson's 1967 Budget was $158.6 billion, \"Which atthe time seemed astronomical. Mr. Nixon claimed that if that amount were notsliced by $10 billion the country faced financial disaster. At a time when theVietnam War was a far bigger financial drain than it is now, Richard Nixonargued that we should be spending around $150 billion. President Nixon is nowspending $230 billion, and bills already introduced in Congress and likely topass could push the 1972 Fiscal Budget (July 1, 1971 to July 1, 1972) to $250billion.The point is that the man who campaigned as Mr. Frugal in 1968 is, in his thirdyear of office, out-spending by $80 to $100 billion what he said his predecessorshould spend. And some experts are predicting that Mr. Nixon could spend as muchas $275 billion next year.This is the same Richard Nixon who in Dallas on October 11, 1968, declared that\"America cannot afford four years of Hubert Humphrey in the White House\" becausehe had advocated programs which would have caused \"a spending spree that wouldhave bankrupted this nation.\" Candidate Nixon flayed the Johnson Administrationfor failing \"to cut deficit spending which is the cause of our presentinflation.\" Budget deficits, he said, \"lie at the heart of our troubles.\" Forhis own part, he renounced any \"massive step-up\" in federal spending. \"This is aprescription for further inflation,\" said Nixon. \"I believe it is also aprescription for economic disaster.\"While it took LBJ five years to run up a $55 billion deficit, Senator Harry Byrdnotes that the accumulated deficit for Mr. Nixon's first three years will reachat least $88 billion. Congressional experts are now predicting Richard Nixoncould well pour on the red ink to a total of $124 billion in this term of officealone.In order to halt inflation Mr. Nixon has now instituted wage and price controls.Most Americans, sick of seeing their paychecks shrink in purchasing power eachmonth, have overwhelmingly approved. But this is because most people are notaware of the real causes of inflation. And you can be sure that theEstablishment's landscape painters will not explain the truth to them. The truthis that there is a difference between inflation and the wage-price spiral. Whenthe government runs a deficit, brand new money in the amount of the deficit isput into circulation. As the new money percolates through the economy it bids upwages and prices. This is easy to understand if you think of our economy as agiant auction. Just as at any other auction, if the bidders are suddenlysupplied with more money, they will use that money to bid up prices. Inflation,in reality, is an increase in the supply of money. It causes the wage-pricespiral which is generally mislabeled inflation. You could not have a wage pricespiral if you did not have an increase in the money supply with which to pay it.This is not just economics, it is physics. You can't fill a quart bottle with apint of milk. To say that the wage-price spiral causes inflation is like sayingwet streets cause rain. Mr. Nixon, unlike the vast majority of the Americanpublic, is aware of the real causes of \"inflation.\" He explained it clearly onJanuary 27, 1970:\"The inflation we have at the start of the Seventies was caused by heavy deficitspending in the Sixties. In the past decade, the Federal Government spent morethan it took inâ$57 billion more. These deficits caused prices to rise 25percent in a decade.\"Business blames \"inflation\" on the unions, and unions blame \"inflation\" onbusiness, but only the government can cause \"inflation.\"Mr. Nixon has fastened wage and price controls on the economy supposedly tosolve a problem which Mr. Nixon (and LBJ) created by running huge deficits. Ifhe sincerely wanted to stop \"inflation\" he would have put wage and pricecontrols on the government rather than on the rest of us and would have stoppeddeficit spending. People are cheering Nixon because he \"did something.\" This isakin to cheering for a motorist who shoots a pedestrian he has just run over.Wage and price controls are at the very heart of Socialism. You can't have atotalitarian government without wage and price controls and you can't have afree country with them. Why? You cannot impose slavery upon people who haveeconomic freedom. As long as people have economic freedom, they will be free.Wage and price controls are people controls. In his Phase II speech, Mr. Nixonmade it clear that the 90-day wage and price controls are with us in onedisguise or another from now on. They are a major step towards establishing anall-powerful Executive branch of the federal government.After the Insiders have established the United Socialist States of America (infact if not in name), the next step is the Great Merger of all nations of theworld into a dictatorial world government. This was the main reason behind thepush to bring Red China into the United Nations. If you want to control thenatural resources, transportation, commerce and banking for the whole world, youmust put everybody under the same roof.The Insiders' code word for the world superstate is \"new world order,\" a phraseoften used by Richard Nixon. The Council on Foreign Relations states in itsStudy No.7: \"The U.S. must strive to: A. BUILD A NEW INTERNATIONAL ORDER.\"(Capitals in the original) Establishment spokesman James Reston (CFR) declaredin his internationally syndicated column for the New York Times of May 21, 1971:\"Nixon would obviously like to preside over the creation of a new world order,and believes he has an opportunity to do so in the last 20 months of his firstterm.\"A world government has always been the object of the Communists. In 1915, in No.40 of the Russian organ, The Socialist Democrat, Lenin proposed a \"United Statesof the World.\" The program of the Communist International of 1936 says thatworld dictatorship \"can be established only by victory of socialism in differentcountries or groups of countries, after which the Proletariat Republics wouldunite on federal lines with those already in existence, and this system wouldexpandâ¦at length forming the world union of Soviet Socialist Republics.\"One of the most important groups promoting the \"world union\" is the United WorldFederalists, whose membership is heavily interlocked with that of the Council onForeign Relations. The UWF advocate turning the UN into a full-fledged worldgovernment which would include the Communist nations.Richard Nixon is, of course, far too clever to actually join the UWF, but he hassupported their legislative program since his early days in Congress. In theOctober 1948 issue of the UWF publication World Government News, on page 14,there appears the following announcement: \"Richard Nixon: Introduced worldgovernment resolution (HCR 68) 1947, and ABC (World Government) resolution1948.\"World government has a strong emotional appeal for Americans, based on theiruniversal desire for world peace. The Insiders have the Communists rattlingtheir sabers with one hand and dangling the olive branch with the other.Naturally everyone gravitates towards the olive branch, not realizing that theolive branch is controlled by another arm of the entity that is rattling thesabers.In September of 1968, candidates for public office received a letter from theUnited World Federalists that stated:\"Our organization has been endorsed and commended by all U.S. presidents in thelast 20 years and by the current nominees for the presidency. As examples wequote as follows:Richard Nixon: 'Your organization can perform an important service by continuingto emphasize that world peace can only come through world law. Our goal is worldpeace. Our instrument for achieving peace will be law and justice. If weconcentrate our energies toward these ends, I am hopeful that real progress canbe made.'Hubert Humphrey: 'Every one of us is committed to brotherhood among all nations,but no one pursues these goals with more dignity and dedication than the UnitedWorld Federalists.'\"There really was not a dime's worth of difference. Voters were given the choicebetween CFR world government advocate Nixon and CFR world government advocateHumphrey. Only the rhetoric was changed to fool the public.A world government requires a world supreme court, and Mr. Nixon is on record infavor of a world supreme court. And a world government must have a world policeforce to enforce the laws of the World Super state and keep the slaves fromrebelling. The Los Angeles Examiner of October 28, 1950, reported thatCongressman Richard Nixon had introduced a \"resolution calling for theestablishment of a United Nations police forceâ¦\"Not surprisingly, the Insiders have their pet planners preparing to administratetheir world dictatorship. Under an immense geodetic dome at Southern IllinoisUniversity is a completely detailed map of the world which occupies the space ofthree football fields. Operating under grants from the Ford, Carnegie andRockefeller foundations (all extensively interlocked with the CFR) a battery ofscientists including everything from geographers, psychologists and behavioralscientists to natural scientists, biologists, biochemists and agronomists aremaking plans to control people. These elite planners conduct exercises in whatthey call \"the world game.\" For example: There are too many people in Country Aand not enough people in Country B. How do you move people from Country A toCountry B? We need so many males, so many females, so many of this occupationand so many of that occupation, so many of this age and so many of that age. Howdo you get these people from Country A and settle them in Country B in theshortest possible time? Another example:We have an uprising in Country C (or as it would now be called, District C) Howlong does it take to send in \"peace\" forces to stop the insurgency?The World Game people run exercises on global control. If you plan on runningthe world, you cannot go about it haphazardly. That is why the Insiders of theFord, Carnegie and Rockefeller foundations are making these plans. The real nameof the game is 1984. We will have systematic population reduction, forcedsterilization or anything else which the planners deem necessary to establishabsolute control in their humanitarian utopia. But to enforce these plans, youmust have an all-powerful world government. You can't do this if individualnations have sovereignty. And before you can facilitate the Great Merger, youmust first centralize control within each nation, destroy the local police andremove the guns from the hands of the citizenry. You must replace our once freeConstitutional Republic with an all-powerful central government; and that isexactly what is happening today with the Nixon Administration. Every action ofany consequence, despite the smokescreen, has centralized more power in what israpidly becoming an all-powerful central government.What we are witnessing is the Communist tactic of pressure from above andpressure from below, described by Communist historian Jan Kozak as the deviceused by the Reds to capture control of Czecho-Slovakia. The pressure from abovecomes from secret, ostensibly respectable Comrades in the government andEstablishment, forming, with the radicalized mobs in the streets below, a giantpincer around middle-class society. The street rioters are pawns, shills,puppets, and dupes for an oligarchy of elitist conspirators working above toturn America's limited government into an unlimited government with totalcontrol over our lives and property.The American middle class is being squeezed to death by a vise. (See Chart 9) Inthe streets we have avowed revolutionary groups such as the Students for aDemocratic Society (which was started by the League for Industrial Democracy, agroup with strong CFR ties), the Black Panthers, the Hippies, the YoungSocialist Alliance. These groups chant that if we don't \"change\" America, wewill lose it. \"Change\" is a word we hear over and over. By \"change\" these groupsmean Socialism. Virtually all members of these groups sincerely believe thatthey are fighting the Establishment. In reality they are an indispensable allyof the Establishment in fastening Socialism on all of us. The naive radicalsthink that under Socialism the \"people\" will run everything. Actually, it willbe a clique of Insiders in total control, consolidating and controlling allwealth. That is why these schoolboy Lenins and teenage Trotskys are allowed toroam free and are practically never arrested or prosecuted. They are protected.If the Establishment wanted the revolutionaries stopped, how long do you thinkthey would be tolerated?Chart 9[../images/00028.jpeg]Instead, we find that most of these radicals are the recipients of largesse frommajor foundations or are receiving money from the government through the War onPoverty. The Rothschild-Rockefeller-CFR Insiders at the top \"surrender to thedemands\" for Socialism from the mobs below. The radicals are doing the work ofthose whom they hate the most.Remember Bakunin's charge that Marx' followers had one foot in the bank and theother in the Socialist movement.Further indications of Establishment financing of the Communist S.D.S. arecontained in James Kunen's The Strawberry Statement: Notes of A CollegeRevolutionary. Describing events at the 1968 S.D.S. national convention, Kunensays:\"Also at the convention, men from Business International Roundtablesâthemeetings sponsored by Business International for their client groups and headsof governmentâtried to buy up a few radicals. These men are the world's leadingindustrialists and they convene to decide how our lives are going to go. Theseare the boys who wrote the Alliance for Progress. They're the left wing of theruling class.They agreed with us on black control and student controlâ¦They want McCarthy in. They see fascism as the threat, see it coming fromWallace. The only way McCarthy could win is if the crazies and young radicalsact up and make Gene look more reasonable. They offered to finance ourdemonstrations in Chicago. We were also offered Esso (Rockefeller) money. Theywant us to make a lot of radical commotion so they can look more in the centeras they move to the left.\"THAT IS THE STRATEGY. THE LANDSCAPE PAINTERS FOCUS YOUR ATTENTION ON THE KIDS INTHE STREET WHILE THE REAL DANGER IS FROM ABOVE. As Frank Capell recently observed in The Review Of The News:\"Of course, we know that these radical students are not going to take over thegovernment. What they are going to do is provide the excuse for the governmentto take over the people, by passing more and more repressive laws to 'keepthings under control.'\"The radicals make a commotion in the streets while the Limousine Liberals at thetop in New York and Washington are Socializing us. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE ADICTATORSHIP OF THE ELITE DISGUISED AS A DICTATORSHIP OF THE PROLETARIAT.Now the Insiders of the Establishment are moving into a more sophisticatedmethod of applying pressure from below. John Gardner, a \"Republican\" and memberof the CFR, has established a grassroots proletarian organization called CommonCause. This may become the biggest and most important organization in Americanhistory. Common Cause's goal is to organize welfare recipients, those who havenot voted before, and Liberals to lobby for Socialism. That lobbying will notonly be expressed in pressuring Congress to pass Socialist legislation but willalso be expressed as ballot power in elections. Common Cause is supposedly theepitome of anti-Establishmentarianism, but who is paying the bills? The eliteInsider radicals from above. The number one bankroller of this group tooverthrow the super-rich and redistribute their wealth among the poor is John D.Rockefeller III. Other key financiers are Andrew Heiskell (CFR), chairman of theboard of Time, Inc.; Thomas Watson (CFR), chairman of the board of IBM; JohnWhitney (CFR) of the Standard Oil fortune; Sol Linowitz (CFR), chairman of theboard of Xerox; and Gardner Cowles (CFR) of Cowles publications. In anyorganization, the man who pays the bills is the boss. The others are hisemployees.What better proof could we have that Socialism is not a movement of downtroddenmasses but of power hungry elitists? The poor are merely pawns in the game.Needless to say, the landscape painters hide Common Cause's financial angels sothat only those who understand that the Establishment's game plan is SOCIALISMunderstand what is going on before their very eyes."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8YOU ARE THE ANSWER Many people cannot refrain from rationalizing. After reading this book, somewill bemoan the fact that the situation is hopeless. These will be many of thesame people who, before reading this book, really did not believe the problemsfacing us were serious. Some people wake up and give up in the same week. Thisis, of course, just exactly what the Insiders want you to do.The conspiracy can be defeated. The Insiders are not omnipotent. It is true thatthey control important parts of the federal government, high finance and themass media. But they do not control everything, or the vise would already havebeen closed. We might say the conspiracy controls everything but you. You aretheir Achilles heel if you are willing to fight. There is an old clichÃ© insports that quitters never win and winners never quit. We need a millionAmericans who are not quitters, but, moreover, who have the will to win!Of course, you can't buck the conspiracy head onâ¦trying to fight it on its homegrounds. But the Insiders are vulnerable to an end run. You, and thousands ofothers like you can make an end run if you want to. It is our intention in thisclosing chapter to show why it can be done and how you can do it.The timing for an end run has never been better. What Barry Goldwater said in1964, people were willing to believe in 1968. Most people who voted for Nixondid so because he promised to balance the budget, not establish wage and pricecontrols; slash government spending, not multiply it; cut welfare, not push fora guaranteed annual income; stand firm against the Communists, not lead the RedChinese into the U. N.; build America's defenses, not continue to unilaterallydisarm us; and stop aid and trade with our avowed Communist enemies, not doubleit. These were the issues which supposedly differentiated Nixon from Humphrey.Now we see that Nixon has repudiated his own promises and carried out those ofhis opponent. By 1972, millions of Americans will have concluded that there islittle difference between the leadership of the two major parties. And more andmore people are beginning to realize that there is a tiny clique of conspiratorsat the top which controls both the Democrat and Republican Parties.The one thing these conspirators cannot survive is exposure. The Insiders aresuccessful only because so few of their victims know what is being planned andhow Insiders are carrying out those plans. Conspiracies can operate only in thedark. They cannot stand the truthful light of day. Once any sizable minority ofthe American people becomes aware of the conspiracy and what it is up to, themany decades of patient planning and work by the Insiders in this country can bedestroyed in an amazingly short period of time.This job is largely a matter of getting others to realize that they have beenconned and are continuing to be conned. You must become the local arm of theworld's largest floating university. But before you can go to work, pointing outthese conspiratorial facts to others, you must know the facts yourself. Thisbook is designed to give you these facts, and can be your greatest tool. It isavailable on tape cassettes so that you can virtually memorize its contents bylistening to it repeatedly while you are washing the dishes or driving to andfrom work. The concept of an army of individuals which is dedicated to exposing\"the conspiracy\" frightens the Insiders because it works outside the channelswhich they control.Richard Nixon has said of the Republican Party: \"We've got to have a tenteveryone can get into.\" The Democrats have obviously believed that for a longtime.But a Party must be based on principles or it has no justification forexistence. Bringing Socialists into the Republican Party theoretically maybroaden the base, but, in reality, serves only to disfranchise those who believein a Constitutional Republic and the free enterprise system.In 1972, the Republicans will try to make you forget that Richard Nixon waselected on George Wallace's platform but has been carrying out HubertHumphrey's. The pitch will be \"party unity.\" \"If not Nixon then who?\" will bethe typical response to complaints about Nixon's actions. But unity with evil isevil. During the campaign of 1972, Nixon will again talk conservatively whilethe CFR's Democrat candidate will sound frighteningly radical in order tostampede you into accepting Nixon as the lesser of two evils. The Establishmentmay even run its John Lindsay or Eugene McCarthy as a far Left third or fourthparty candidate in order to split the Democratic Party and re-elect RichardNixon with a comparatively small number of votes.It is only logical that the Insiders will try to apply the coup de grace againstAmerica through a Republican President simply because most people cannot believethat a Republican could be \"soft on Communism\" or would jeopardize our libertyor sovereignty. The watchdogs tend to go to sleep with a Republican in office.Democrats and Republicans must break the Insider control of their respectiveparties. The CFR-types and their flunkies and social climbing opportunistsupporters must be invited to leave or else the Patriots must leave.It is up to you to put the politicians on the spot and make the CFR-Insiders acampaign issue. This can be accomplished easily by creating the base of thinkingthat will oppose their positions. The Socialists must be forced to gather intoone party. The conspiracy doesn't want the resultant clear distinction betweenparty ideologies. The Insiders want the issues between the parties to be cloudyand gray, centering on personalities, not principles. Neither party can come outstrongly against Socialism as long as it is pushing Socialist programs. But thatis the way the Insiders want it.The issue, very simply, is the enslavement of you and your children. Justbecause many of these Insiders are theoretically Americans, don't think theywill spare this country the terror they have brought to thirty others throughtheir hired Communist thugs. To the Insiders, the world is their country andtheir only loyalty is to themselves and their fellow conspirators. Being anAmerican means no more to them than being an honorary citizen of Bali would meanto you. It has not bothered their consciences one iota that millions of yourfellow human beings have been murdered, including 50,000 of your own sons inVietnam. In order to solidify their power in the United States they will need todo here the same thing they have done in other countries. They will establishand maintain their dictatorship through stark terror. The terror does not endwith the complete take-over of the Republic. Rather, then terror just beginsâ¦fortotal, all-encompassing terror is an absolute necessity to keep a dictatorshipin power. And terror does not mean merely punishing the enemies of the NewOrder. Terror requires the murdering and imprisoning of people at randomâ¦evenmany of those who helped them come to power.Those who are complacent and hope to escape the terror because they were notinvolved in politics or resisted the New Order coming to power must be made, byyou, to understand that this all-encompassing need for terror includes themespeciallyâ¦ that they cannot escape by doing nothing.What can we expect from the conspiracy during the next few years? Here arefourteen signposts on the road to totalitarianism compiled some years ago byhistorian Dr. Warren Carroll and a refugee from Yugoslavian Communism, MikeDjordjevich. The list is not in any particular order nor is the order of anyparticular significance as given here. But the imposition of any one of thesenew restrictions on liberty (none of which was in effect when the list wascompiled) would be a clear warning that the totalitarian state is very near; andonce a significant number of themâperhaps five have been imposed, we canrationally conclude that the remainder would not be far behind and that thefight for freedom and the preservation of the Republic has been lost in thiscountry. FOURTEEN SIGNPOSTS TO SLAVERY1.Restrictions on taking money out of the country and on the establishment orretention of a foreign bank account by an American citizen.2.Abolition of private ownership of hand guns.3.Detention of individuals without judicial process.4.Requirements that private financial transactions be keyed to social securitynumbers or other government identification so that government records of thesetransactions can be kept and fed into a computer.5.Use of compulsory education laws to forbid attendance at presently existingprivate schools.6.Compulsory non-military service.7.Compulsory psychological treatment for non-government workers or public schoolchildren.8.An official declaration that anti-Communist organizations are subversive andsubsequent legal action taken to suppress them.9.Laws limiting the number of people allowed to meet in a private home.10.Any significant change in passport regulations to make passports moredifficult to obtain or use.11.Wage and price controls, especially in a non-wartime situation12.Any kind of compulsory registration with the government of where individualswork.13.Any attempt to restrict freedom of movement within the United States.14.Any attempt to make a new major law by executive decree (that is, actuallyput into effect, not merely authorized as by existing executive orders.) As you are no doubt aware President Nixon already has invoked numbers 1, 11 and14.Steps 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 12 and 13 already have been proposed and some are activelycampaigned for by organized groups. As of January 1, 1972 banks must report tothe government any deposit or withdrawal over $5,000. The next step will be torestrict the taking of money out of the country. Big Brother is watching yourbank account!Increased government control over many kinds of private schools is proposedannually in many state legislatures. Compulsory non-military serviceâa universaldraft of all young men and women, with only a minority going into the armedservices has been discussed by the Nixon Administration as an alternative to thedraft. Sensitivity training is already required for an increasing number ofgovernment workers, teachers and school children. As long ago as 1961, VictorReuther proposed that anti-Communist groups and organizations be investigatedand placed on the Attorney General's subversive list. The propaganda war inprogress to force registration or confiscation of firearms is the number onepriority of all the collectivistsâan armed citizenry is the major roadblock to atotalitarian takeover of the United States.You are in this fight whether you want to be or not. Unless you are an Insider,you are a victim. Whether you are a multimillionaire or a pauper you have anenormous amount at stake.The Insiders are counting on your being too preoccupied with your own problemsor too lazy to fight back while the chains of slavery are being fastened on you.They are counting on their mass media to con you, frighten you, or ridicule youout of saving your freedom, and, most of all, they are counting on your thinkingyou can escape by not taking part in opposing their takeover.They are also counting on those of you who recognize the conspiracy becoming soinvolved with watching all moves that you become totally mesmerized by theirmachinations, and thus become incapable of acting.The choice is yours. You can say, \"It can't happen here!\" But nearly every oneof the one billion people enslaved by the Communists since 1945 doubtless saidthe same thing. Or you can end run this whole conspiratorial apparatus.The choice you must make was enunciated by Winston Churchill when he told thepeople of England:\"If you will not fight for right when you can easily win without bloodshed; ifyou will not fight when your victory will be sure and not too costly; you maycome to the moment when you will have to fight with all the odds against you andonly a precarious chance of survival.\"Because we have ignored warning after warning, we are now at that place inhistory. Unless you do your part now, you will face a further choice, alsodescribed by Mr. Churchill. He said:\"There may be even a worse fate. You may have to fight when there is no hope ofvictory, because it is better to perish than live as slaves.\" WHAT WILL YOU DO?If you are unwilling to get involved because you feel it may be bad for businessor may jeopardize your social respectability, just look into the eyes of yourchildren and tell them that making a buck and climbing the social ladder aremore important to you than they are.This is the end of our case.If you have decided not to do anything about it, then you can close this book,read no further, and turn out the light. That is just what you will be doing forthe United States of America, and may God help us. And may He have mercy on yoursoul.If you decide that you will do somethingâthat you at least are not yetcontrolled - read on - pick up the ball we are tossing you and with thousands ofothers, let's \"end run\" the conspiracy. Here's how: The four keys in this program are:1. You. What you do now is, of course, the key to this whole operation. If youdelay, your motivation will wane, your concern will recede, but the danger willincrease. Remember, the Insiders don't care how much you know about theirconspiracy so long as you don't do anything about it. So keep reading and thenact.2. This book: None Dare Call It Conspiracy. In writing this book we have triedto give a concise overall picture of the nature of the conspiracy. We wrote itnot only to explain the conspiracy, but to give you a complete program of actionnow, so that the many \"You's\" around the country would not necessarily have tobe articulate sales men to make your \"end run.\" You can simply pass this bookout and let it do the job for you. The conspiracy may be able to stiflepublicity on this book and keep it off the magazine rack at your localsupermarket, but they can't stop you from distributing it to friends, neighbors,relatives and business associates and especially in your precinct. With apotential 30 million distribution of this book to those mentioned above (and ina manner yet to be described), you will create a base of opinion that will throwthe Insiders out.It is quite possible that in distributing this book, questions will come upconcerning certain statements and conclusions with which you are not able todeal. There are a number of organizations that have well documented material onall subjects raised in this book. But after considerable personal research theauthor has concluded that the organization which is the leader in this field,has had the most experience, and is doing the best job of exposing theconspiracy is The John Birch Society.Doesn't it appear strange that this organization which works towarddecentralization of political power and the exposure of the Insiders should beso vilified by the mass media, while the Council On Foreign Relations, whichpromotes centralization of power in the hands of a few within a worldgovernment, is practically never mentioned? So contact The John Birch Societyfor further back-up information (Belmont, Massachusetts 02178- San Marino,California 91108âor check your telephone directory for the nearest AmericanOpinion Bookstore)3. Your Precinct. The precinct is the lowest denominator in our politicalstructure. Any politician will agree that whoever reaches and influences themost people in the precinct wins the election. When you break down the job to bedone to this least common denominator, it doesn't seem to be nearly as big a jobas when you look at those millions of votes that need to be switched. Manyelections are won or lost by less than five votes per precinct. Remember thatevery vote-switch you can accomplish (by planting the seed with your book)really amounts to two votes, as it takes one from the other side.Start your \"end run\" in your own precinct now. Lists of registered voters areavailable from your County Registrar. With everyone working within his ownprecinct, the hit and miss efforts of prior years will be avoided andorganization will be added to this effort. A blanket coverage of your precinctwill create talk between neighbors on this subject and thereby greatly increasethe number of persons reading this book.4. Your Congressman. You have now completed the three simple basic moves in your\"end runâ. Barring a wholesale awakening by the American people, it is probablywishful thinking to believe that the CFR's hold on the Presidency can be brokenin 1972. But it is possible to block the Insiders' men in the House ofRepresentatives. Congress can still lift a powerful voice against the conspiracyif only it would. It can also throw a searchlight on to the CFR's strangleholdon the executive branch of the government. No burglar tries to rob a house whena spotlight is on him. With your effort Congress can be that spotlight.It is at the Congressional level that the conspiracy can be delayed at leastuntil there is sufficient strength to rout it. But your local Congressionalcandidate must be forced to take a public stand on the Council on ForeignRelations, its goals, and its power in the federal government. And once yourcandidate is elected you must make sure that he does not submit to theincredible pressure which will be put upon him in Washington to compromise hisprinciples. The Congressman for whom you are laying the base for election mustbe as steadfast in Washington as he is at home in personal conversation withyou. Keep in mind that a Congressman must return to his constituents every twoyears for re-approval.How would you like to be a Congressman who had voted for any one of the 14Signposts to Slavery, asking to be elected by constituents who had read NoneDare Call It Conspiracy? It is therefore easier to keep a Congressman on thestraight and narrow than a Senator or the President. The latter run lessfrequently than Congressmen and represent tremendously larger geographicalareas. Although it is not easy, it is still possible for a good Congressman tofinance his campaign from within his district and not be dependent on theInsiders for campaign contributions.If there are no Congressional candidates worth supporting in your area at thistime, support one or more in other areas. Never contribute money to theRepublican or Democratic National Committee. That money, except in tokenamounts, will never reach anti-CFR-Establishment candidates, most of whom sufferfrom a severe shortage of funds, at least until they are well established. Onlycontribute your campaign dollars to those who are committed to fighting theconspiracy. A candidate running on good conservative principles is not enough.We've had many such candidates, and although most of them are very good men,they never come to grips with the real problemsâexposing those behind the WorldSocialist Movement.So, organize your \"end run,\" pass out your books and then keep your eagle eye onyour Congressman and his voting record.This \"end run\" concept we are suggesting is not just a game we are playing eventhough we use a football term.To summarize: You do not necessarily have to be an articulate salesman to makethis \"end run.\" You do not necessarily have to know all the ins and outs of thetotal conspiracyâthe book is intended to do this for you.All you have to do is find the wherewithal to purchase the books and one way oranother see that you blanket your precinct with them. Then force yourCongressman to stand up to the CFR Establishment.It is simple. It is straightforward. It is a workable plan.With 30 million \"end runs\" being made during 1972, you can, and will, rout theconspiracy, turn the tide of history and prevent the enslavement of yourself andyour family.Remember, seeds planted in 1972 will pay off not only this year, but in 1974 and1976. If we do not build a large counter-revolutionary base in 1972 the ballgame will be lost by 1976."},{"pageContent":"MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS NOMINATED AND APPOINTED BY PRESIDENTNIXON TO GOVERNMENT POSTSADM GEORGE W ANDERSON JR,Chairman, President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board DR.
