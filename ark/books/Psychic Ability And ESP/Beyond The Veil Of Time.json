Frankly, I don ’ t know for sure other than to say they are a remarkably advanced form of highly intelligent beings who - by using the mind of internationally renowned trance -medium, Carole Davis-Wilson - are sending us a warning of a rapidly approaching total magnetic-pole reversal that will trigger cataclysmic Earth- changes of a magnitude totally in comprehensible to man. These ‘ changes ’ , we are told, will signal the end of our global civilization as we know it. Although their message is for ALL people on Earth, we are told that only a small number of people - those with ‘ Like-Mnds ’ - will both heed the warning and act on it. The rest of the world will either ignore it, ridicule it, or put it to one side until it is too late. To underscore the importance of what The Monitors are telling us - and to give credibility to what they are saying - they have included info rmation on a number of our modern scientific hypotheses whic h, they claim, are badly-flaw ed. They tell us that the ‘ Big Bang-Creation-of-the-Universe ’ theory is only marginally corre ct: That the speed of light is NOT absolute: ‘ Matter ’ is formed from what they call, ‘ The Essence of Pure Energy ’ : ‘ Man ’ was not ‘ created ’ by ‘ God ’ but by the ‘ Soul-Spirit ’ that is within him: How inter- dimensional and inter-galacti c travel can be achieved by mechanical means: What we should know about ‘ Man-made ’ Religions: Why Man fights Man and Nations wage Wars: Why our Soul-Spirits came to Earth in the firs t place, and - last but not least - why so many of them have remained her e - trapped within the Earth ’ s magneto-sphere - for thousands upon thousands of years.

By either manifesting as - or melding with - various 'life-forms' compatible to the environmen- tal conditions of the Earth, they were able to experience and understand hitherto unknown emotions and feelings that in soul-spirit or ethereal form, t hey could not otherwise discern. This alien invasion was to be the beginning of Mankind as we know it, and, at that time in our planet's history, our Earth was accessible to these alien visitors only because of an anomaly in the magnetic field that surrounds our planet. This anomaly wa s analogous to a 'tear' in the dimensional fabric of space-time reality which enabled these partially ethereal visitors to come and go, as though through an open gate, from this world - the world of Third dimension vibrations - into the multi-dimensional levels that lie beyond. Over a period of many sessions, Carole and I discovered that our host-communicator professed to be one of the ancient 'Monitors' who claimed to have been present on this planet during the time the so-called 'electromagnetic dimensional gates' had first begun to close in around Earth. We learned of the large numbers of alien soul-spirits who - at that time - had become trapped within the Earth's magnetosphere when the 'gates' finally cl osed, leaving them caught within the confines of our planet's magnetic field until such time as the next polar reversal would re-open the 'gates' and"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 9 release them back into the dimension (or dimens ions) from which they had originally come. These soul-spirits - or, I should say, our soul-spirits, for together we share a common bond - have been held as prisoners within the confines of this planet's magnetic field ever since . . . reincarnating over and over again in this limited dimension until such time as they (we) are released to return to the dimensions of our choice. The Monitor went on to relate how he and a number of other 'visitors' had been able to partially escape from Earth before the dimensional 'gates' closed around them. \"We escaped being trapped in the Third dimension at the time we were trying to keep the dimensional gates open by artificial means, \" he said, \"but we were using uncontrollable energy (at the time) and, as a result, were unable to escape completely. We now remain in a dimension and a Universe that, in many aspects, are similar to that with which you are familiar, (i.e.), your planet Earth. Your (physical) bodies are merely dictat ed by the energy that surrounds you, but we - not being encumbered by the surroundings in which you find yourselves trapped - can assume whichever shape we need.\" Monitor paused for a long moment before going on. This came as no surprise to me, for the people he referred to as being 'forever trapped in the dimension of body' are those human beings here on Earth who are incapable of seeing anything beyond the material world around them, and, like donkeys with carrots on sticks held before them, see only that which relates directly to their own desires, power-trips, vested interests and physical well-being. Carole and I usually refer to these people as the ‘ G-B ’ s ('Gross-Beings'). The voice continued. \"We are closer to you now as the dimensional gates begin to align themselves once more. (In the past), we have given you information regarding the two moons, your Earth, and the Sun. This was such a time.\" He was referring to information we had received while Carole and I were preparing our"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 10 first book, ‘ The Skull Speaks ’ . At that time we had been told that there two moons within our own Earth's gravitational influence. (NOTE: S o far, my research has not been able to confirm or deny such a claim). He continued. \"Now comes closer unto your planet Earth, that which takes the place of the moon which was destroyed,\" he said. He went on to tell of the time when the destruction of this secondary moon occurred. \"Its destruction came about by intervention of mechanical means. We altered the gravitational pull of the Earth and the Moons. . . \" He paused for a moment, then in a tone that expressed great sadness, continued. \"It was not our intention to do this, but (at the time) we were not as familiar with the density that the Earth brings unto itself, therefore there was a . . .\" His voice trailed off for a moment as he sought for a word to describe the enormity of the event. \"It is a word like catastrophe . . . but it is much more than that.\" \"Cataclysmic?\" I volunteered. \"Cataclysm! Yes, that is it.\" Again he paused as a new trend of thought began to form. \"We are not different . . . we are not different: We are All of One. The downfall of Earth is man's acknowledgment of the 'Other',\" he said. \"You must recognize and understand 'The Law of One'.\" By this, we learned later, our Monitor was speaking of the duality of our existence on Earth, in both Physical and Soul-Spirit forms - and of our Physical form's failure to acknowledge that the Soul-Spirit is Man; not the other way round. He is saying, in effect, that those of 'The Law of One' are those whose soul-spirits are joined together as a single 'One-ness That Is All\", and that by losing sight of this fact, mankind's ve ry existence is in jeopardy. Our concentration on materiality in conjunction with our primal physical desires has contributed to our downfall as Spiritual beings. We had left the metaphorical Gar den of Eden - the paradise that was ours in our Soul-Spirit existence - and become totally absorbed wi th the physicality of this new existence. We had, as it were, 'fallen from grace'. In actuality, he is espousing the very same philosophies, thoughts and beliefs that can be found in the teachings of nearly all of the ancient prophets and"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 11 philosophers from many different faiths and lands. Is this a coincidence, or did they really have knowledge of something we - with all of our modern wisdom - are just beginning to discover? - * - * - * - During one session while preparing ‘ The Skull Speaks ’ I had been introduced, (through Carole) to an entity who claimed to be associated with UFO's. The information we received sounded so farfetched and hard to swallow that I found myself unable to include any of it in the book. Carole - who was using the Mitchell-Hedges Crystal Skull as an 'amplifying-oscillatory' device at that time - had managed to reach many different entities who were doing the channeling though her. This UFO-related material had intrigued me, and I was now anxious to follow it up. I posed the following question. \"There appear to be many objects that we term 'UFO's' - Unidentified Flying Objects - in our atmosphere that have been seen - or supposedly seen - by many people. What can you tell us about them?\" \"Those that you call 'Unidentified' would be 'Tim e-Travelers'. They would be vehicles from other galaxies,\" the Voice replied. \"We will seek to connect you.\" I had not asked to be 'connected' with yet another Entity, but, nevertheless, jumped at the opportunity of hearing first-hand from any 'expert' who may be able to shed more light on the subject. There was a long pause as Carole underwent a strange personality change. She laughed pleasantly, and began speaking in a soft, low voice. \"You seek information about galactic travel and our craft? How may we help you?\" \"We need information - verification,\" I explained. \"I understand,\" the voice replied. \"We wish to know about the existence of Unidentified Flying Objects, and of the 'Aliens'"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 12 who supposedly inhabit them and whether or not they have connected with people here on Earth. Is this at all possible?\" \"Yes, there have been those sighted, and there have been many landings, many communications, and many details given to a large number of Earth people. We come in various forms: Some were the last to leave the 'Twin-Star System', which is much like this small planet but without the negative vibrations.\" He paused before continuing. \"Many of the craft that you see are unmanned, sent in advance to seek out life on this planet.\" Again he paused. \"You will have far more c ontact with that which you perceive as 'human beings' when your Earth turns warm (if we are unable to) penetrate the bands surrounding you,\" he said, referring to the Earth's magneto-spheric shield, \"But, with the help of people, such as yourself upon the Earth, we will land and help restore sanity and peace.\" This Voice signed off with a friendly farewell telling me that others would be in touch with me 'immediately'; leaving a 'call signal' etched in my mind should I wish to make a connection. As it turned out, 'immediately', didn't happen for quite a while after the session, but it nevertheless did happen as he said it would. More about that later. My reluctance to include UFO material in ' ’ The Skull Speaks ’ ' stemmed from my own inner doubts. I had read a great deal about UFO's by that time, including a variety of books by credible authorities such as Dr J. Allen Hynek, Jaques and Janine Vallee, Bud Collins, Timothy Goode, Whitney Strieber, Dr. Harley D. Rutledge, and the former head of the U.S. Air Force Project Blue Book, Captain Edward J. Ruppelt, etc. All of them claimed - almost unequivocally - that not only did UFO's exist, but many people had actually been abducted and taken aboard them. Did I believe them? Somewhat, but not entirely: There was still a nagging doubt in my mind simply because I had not seen a UFO myself! Further, there was another reason why I shied away from including any information regarding UFO's - scant as it was - in the first book, and that was a fear of ridicule! I was leery it"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 13 might destroy the credibility of the book if people began linking the Crystal Skull - and the message we were getting about the imminent destruction of our planet by forces unknown - with 'Little Green Men' and Flying Saucers. The ridicule it could have engendered at the time may very well have negated the truth within the message it self and as a result it might have been lost to the very people it was meant to reach. As it turned out, I had no need to fear that side of the equation, for the material contained in ‘ The Skull Speaks ’ has, for the most part, been almost totally ignored by the general media yet by some not so odd coincidence, has reached many of those for whom it was intended. What, then, has changed my mind about divulging other equally bizarre material subsequently received through Carole regarding UFO's? The answer is simple: After ‘ The Skull Speaks ’ had been published, I finally saw my first (and, so far, only) UFO while on vacation in The Turks and Caicos Islands with my wife. From that moment on, all doubts as to their existence vanished from my mind. Today, regardless of how well the Governments of the world may run their conspiracies of silence and programs of ridicule, they will never be able to reverse the remarkable scene my wife and I witnessed on a bright, clear, moonlit stretch of beach on the northern shores of the Turks and Caicos Islands. For over three-quarters of an hour - with the northern constellation, Cassiopeia, as the center of a vast, star-filled backdrop - we watched a demonstration of the most incredible aerobatics I have ever seen. A single UFO sped overhead at an incredible rate of speed - stopped dead in its tracks - reversed its flight path - and then proceeded to do a series of 90 degree turns, loops and spirals at unbelievable speeds. Then, as if thumbing its nose at the US Military machine, it actually 'drew' the out line of an enormous Pentagon across the cloudless sky! It was a remarkable display of advanced technology that set both of us free from all doubt as to the reality of UFO's, and left us with the knowledge that, whatever they might be, or wherever they may come from (be it outer space, other dimensions, or the highly secret base at Area 51)"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 14 these machines are being controlled by an incredibly advanced form of intelligent beings. To deny their existence is ludicrous, and only a totally blind jackass would continue to refute or debunk their existence after witnessing such a remarkable display of technology. During the earliest sessions with Carole, I had asked the Voice-Entity she was channeling at the time (there are many) to explain the method of communication they were using to bridge the dimensional gap, and why they were communicating through her and using the Mitchell- Hedges Crystal Skull as a conduit. \"We are using sound and light,\" the Voice responded. \"This object (the Crystal Skull) is a receptacle of magnification.\" This partially confirmed a suspicion I had begun to nurture that it was not the SKULL that was the means of electromagnetic conduction or amplification, but rather the QUARTZ CRYSTAL from which it is made. In effect, the quartz crystal the skull was made from was merely behaving like an oscillatory device much like the silicon crystal we used in the old-fashioned radio-crystal sets we had used as kids. Carole's fingers - running over the skull - were acting in much the same way as the fine spring wire (we called this the 'Cat's Whisker') we used to put pressure on a quartz crystal in order to create the 'piezoelectric effect' that caused it to oscillate at a frequency compatible to the wave bands broadcast from radi o-transmitting stations. This simple device - in conjunction with an aerial (antenna) and set of headphones - could pick up radio broadcasts from any number of different wave-bands we were able to select by tuning a crude, wire-coiled variable condenser, to the radio station of choice. These ‘ crystal sets ’ were easy and cheap to put together, and requiring neither power nor battery cost absolutely nothing to run. If my assumption was correct, it meant that Carole and the quartz crystal were actually functioning as a receiver of electromagnetically induced waves that were being ‘ broadcast ’ from either unknown sources, or even from another dimension. I coul d not help wondering at the time, if this, perhaps,"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 15 is why crystal balls and other crystal objects have, for centuries, been used by psychically gifted Channel-Mediums and Fort une Tellers to amplify their connections to other-dimensional forms of intelligence? Could this be a possible explanation for channeled medium ship? I asked the Voice if he would tell me from which dimension he was speaking. \"We are not in the dimension known to you as the Third,\" he replied. \"When we communicate we are in the First dimension, but we are 'harmonizing' so that we are able to exist and be seen in both the First and the Third dimensions. \"We have made ourselves manifest, perceivable and understood, to many upon the Earth plane. Look for us in extreme cold, for we will make an appearance,\" he said. \"We are also devising a method to make direct contact with your own 'enquiring mind'.\" The possible success or failure of his last statement is very difficult to assess due to the ambiguity of their methods of 'contact'. The fact that - in nearly all of the reported cases of close encounters of the Third Kind - the Aliens have nearly always made telepathic contact with abductees and others with whom they have been in touch - would indicate that they are capable of communicating directly with anyone they choose in the same telepathic manner. Remote as it may sound, the 'little voices' some people claim to 'hear' (and often blame when trying to justify bizarre actions), could - conceivably - be a communication of sorts from either telepathic-aliens or other-dimensional beings. Weird though it may seem, this is not beyond the realm of possibility. More will be said on the subject in later chapters. Is there a limit regarding distances as far as telepathic communica tions are concerned? I don't know. But I have read that under hypnotic r egression, many 'abductees' have claimed to have had heard 'voices' within their heads when wi thin close proximity to these Alien-beings. However, to date, I have yet to learn of any so-called 'long distance' messages being received. But there again, what is 'near' or 'far' when one is trying to compare our Third dimensional world and standards of measurement with those of other dimensions?"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 16 My own 'awakening' (such as it is) has broadened my knowledge considerably since the first sessions with Carole took place way back in 1982-83. Since that time, I have had a constant flood of information flowing through my mind that was not there before. This ‘ intelligence ’ - for want of a better word - has embraced everythi ng from innovative ideas, inventions, musical compositions, solutions to a number of diverse pr oblems, plus a whole slew of creative theories involving a wide range of subjects in multiple fields. To claim that I, personally, had developed these concepts on my own, would be dishonest at the best, and tantamount to a form of ‘ out-of- this-world ’ plagiarism at the worst. Is it possible that 'they' (whoever 'they' may be) have kept their word and have, indeed, devised a method of communicating directly wi th many of Earth's people without anyone being fully aware of what is happening? Is this their way of bringing change and advancement to our world and, if so, why haven't we solved more of Earth's problems? I asked for some kind of explanation. \"Your mind is constantly being probed,\" he replied. \"We are constantly seeking to bring to your attention our communications, therefore we say, anything you are re ceiving you will have to interpret for yourself. We only affirm that you are in constant communication with us. We do not speak to you from any ‘ vessel ’ (UFO) for we are unable to enter close enough to your Earth's atmosphere, since at this time, the negative forces are testing explosives and nuclear energies. These will be reported by your news systems (media).\" The Voice was, of course, correct in his prediction that the warmongering 'Gross Beings' of many so-called 'advanced' nations would eit her continue to detonate the nuclear devices in their possession, or acquire them from others for the purpose of dominating their neighbors. The United States, USSR (at the time), Britain, Israel, India, Pakistan, China, North Korea and France have all tested, and re-tested, their weapons of mass destruction many times since this message was received, and now, as I update this (April, 2000) , there is every possibility that Iran and Iraq -"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 17 as well as Pakistan and India - will start employing their recently acquired nuclear weapons in real warfare in the not too distant future. The Voice went on to say, \"We, at the present time, geographically speaking, are over the coldest point of your Earth planet. We are ov er your Poles where magnetic disturbances are reacting.\" \"Can you tell us why the weather patterns have changed so drastically since we have been in communication with you?\" I asked. \"You have launched into the atmosphere that which is a communicator,\" he replied. \"You understand this to be a satellite communications system, but in fact it disrupts your atmosphere because of the micro-waves that are constantly being into it - and (away) from your Earth. We would say you are 'bending' the energies. This is extremely dangerous for the well-being of your planet.\" At the time of this communication I had little knowledge as to how micro-waves affected our magnetic shield, the magnetosphere. It was only after I had begun extensive reading regarding the Van Allen Radiation Belts, Current Rings, the Solar Wind, and the Ionosphere (which The Monitors refer to as the ‘ plasma-sphere ’ ) and the interaction of various fields (electro-magnetic and particle combinations, etc.) that I learned just how our radio, and other electro-magnetic transmissions are indeed destroying the atomic structure of the Van Allen Radiation Belts by removing electrons from them at an alarming rate. In addition, on several occasions in the past, high altitude nuclear detonations have released high-energy electrons into the outer atmosphere, which by the sheer force of the explosions, were injected into the geomagnetic field and trapped there. In 1962, for example, an experimental test named 'Starfish' created an intense radiation belt which lasted for many years, no doubt causing changes in the normal radiation belt structures and ultimately affecting the shield that prevents the surface of our Eart h from being bombarded by both cosmic rays from"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 18 beyond the solar system, and from the Sun's magnet ic storms and solar flare residues that are carried by the solar winds. Although I will go into this in greater detail in later chapters, let it suffice to say that the delicate balance between the magnetosphere and the solar and cosmic forces is no less delicate than our planet's ecosystem. If truth be known, it is far more delicate, and subject to greater damage due to the less complex structure of the atomic and sub-atomic particles in the shield. Interference of any kind affects the whole, and it is the whole shield - not just a part of it - that is protecting our planet from both the Cosmos ’ and our sun's radiation. In our world today, we are surrounded by a veritable ocean of High Frequency, Low Frequency and Medium Frequency electromagnetic radiation. Generators, power lines, automobile electrical and ignition systems, home and industrial appliances, television stations, navigational systems, radar, satellite weather broadcas ts etc., etc., all emit radiation of various frequencies. To naively believe that these transmissions are doing no harm to our magneto- sphere underscores the lack of understanding and concern our scientists have for both our fragile world and all life-forms that live upon it. - * - * - * -"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 19 II  =====================================  THE CREATION OF OUR UNIVERSE Up until the time of we had started the sessions with The Monitors, I had read a fair amount of material on theories postulated by such brilliant minds as Stephen Hawking, Roger Penrose, Fred Hoyle, Neils Bohr and many other cosmologists, astrophysicists, theoretical and particle physicists as to the so-called 'creation' of our Universe, and to me, there seemed a great deal missing in both their ideas and conclusions. Although there is still no real consensus as to the 'age' of the Universe, there are those who believe it all started some 12 to17 billion years ago from a minuscule, unimaginably dense point in space they refer to as a 'singularity' . Everything now in our Universe - and they do mean everything - all matter, mass, energy, force-fields and anything else that currently exists in our Universe - including 'Time' itself - originated, they claim, with that impossibly tiny dot in space when it suddenly exploded with a Big Bang! This, our scientists believe, is when the Universe was created and 'Time' began. In fact, as many of you readers already know, both Hawk ing and Penrose believe they can pinpoint the exact moment when even 'Time' began . . . postulating that it occurred between 10- 33 and 10- 34 of the first second after the 'Big Bang'. However, the one thing they don't tell us is that 'Time' exists only in a Third dimensional reality and - more to the point - has neither a beginning nor an end. I find it just as difficult to accept the premise that 'Time' had a 'beginning' as I do in accepting the proposition that EVERYTHING began as a 'point of singularity'. Of equal"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 20 puzzlement to me is how scientists and theoreticians arrived at such a far-out conclusion in the first place. The 'singularity' (or Big Bang) theory is a simplistic device developed by theoretical physicists to explain how an expanding universe might have been created. Incredibly, their conclusions are based on a somewhat dubious form of 'reverse mathematics' which postulates that everything that is here now, must have come from somewhere back then. Their reasoning might be illustrated by the following analogy: Two flea-sized scientists were standing on the skin of a giant balloon as it was being slowly inflated, trying to estimate how long it would take before it would burst. From their careful calculations and astute observations, they ascertained it was inflating at 'X' amount of volume per day and could conceivably reach 'Y' dimensions ov er 'Z' period of time. Pleased with their data, they hastened back to HQ to feed it into a Super-Computer wherein, after several hours of digesting the numbers, it finally spewed out a surprising answer: Give or take a decimal point or two, the ba lloon would finally burst on the second Friday of the third month in the year 2053. They presented the information to their Boss, the HBEPD (Head Balloon Expansion Program Director) who next asked them to calculate where the balloon came from in the first place. Unsure as to how to figure the answer, they decided to instruct the Super-Computer to simply reverse its earlier calculations. This it did. And to their amazement, within less than five minutes, the computer had calculated that the whole balloon - skin and all - would disappear into an infinitely minuscule point in space leaving nary a whimper behind it. They passed this information onto their Boss who, well versed in the English language, claimed it was, indeed, 'a most singular explanation!'. The media picked up the story and, from that day forward, it has been assumed that ALL balloons - of all shapes and sizes - must start off in life as 'points of"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 21 singularity'! This form of logic somehow reminds me of the sad tale of the 'Ooooeee! Ooooeee! Birds' (a rare flock of now extinct Arctic Tern) who, reportedly, flew around in ever-diminishing circles until they eventually disappeared up their own rear ends! - * - * - * - The other major cosmological theory - preceding the 'Big Bang' by a number of years - is 'The Steady State Theory'. Both are based on Bondi's 'c osmological principle' which, in essence, states that no matter where the observer is in a totally homogeneous Universe, it would always look the same in every direction. Regrettably, The Steady State idea was discarded by most cosmologists in favor of the ‘ Big Bang-Singularity ’ hypothesis after Edwin Hubble discovered the Universe was expanding at a uniform rate and therefore, could not be considered in any kind of 'steady-state'. To counter this argument, some of the steady-state advocates attempted to work on a theory that would allow new matter to form as the existing matter spread apart. Unfortunately, this concept ran afoul of the laws of conservation which, in essence, state; the sum of the mass and energy in the Universe must remain constant. However, there is a major flaw in the 'Conservation Law', and that is it deals only with the dimension of the Third and doesn't allow for inter-dimensional interchange of the ESSENCE OF PURE ENERGY (EPE) and MATTER (i.e. MASS) at all . As all scientists will learn to their peril other dimensions have no respec t for Laws conceived by man. \"The limits of Infinity ,\" I have been informed by a very advanced intellect, \" Lie within the Third dimension\" . And although this axiom may appear to be an oxymoron at first, closer examination suggests that most of our existing physical laws apply only to the Third dimension. Some of them will have little if any bearing when applied to dimensions beyond the boundaries of our Universe. The Third dimension is the dimension of MATTER. It is the dimension in which the levels"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 22 of vibration and sub-zero temperatures are well below the frequency (or 'spin') of EPE . In order to fully grasp the difference between our THIRD DIMENSION and the Nth DIMENSION (where EPE exists in its purest form) try to equate it with what happens when an artificial Snow-Making Machine creates snow from a mixture of water and chemicals in the frigid air on a ski slope. The mixture freezes as it combines with the cold air and turns into tiny ice crystals which in turn combine into snowflakes. Now imagine the frigid air on the ski-slope as being our Third-dimensional Universe and the water and chemical mix as being the EPE (the Essence of Pure Energy ) pouring in from the Nth Dimension. As the EPE enters the slower and cooler vibration of the Third dimension it slows down and begins forming into MATTER: Thi s is basically what Einstein stumbled upon when he equated ENERGY = MATTER (MASS) x THE SPEED OF LIGHT SQUARED (i.e. E=MC 2 ). Now try to visualize the whole of the Third dimensional Universe as being a vast open plain somewhere in the Antarctic where temperatures are constantly hovering at -50 ° C (-58 ° F), and then imagine a GIANT STEAM BOILER - full of an endless source of super-heated steam - standing in the middle of it. This Giant Steam-Boiler (representing the SOURCE of all EPE in the Nth dimension ) suddenly springs a small number of minute leaks which shoot jets of super-heated steam out into the freezing temperature where it is instantly cooled by the -50 ° C air and forms into billions of minute ice-crystals. As time goes by, these tiny crystals become mutually attracted to each other and - clumping together - begin to form into varied forms of snow flakes, ice pellets and other crystalline structures which, in turn, form into snowdrifts, ice-packs and glaciers. This is an analogy of what happens to EPE when - in the vibrational form of LIGHT - it enters the Zero Kelvin temperatures and slower vibrational levels of the Third dimension. Just as"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 23 Super-Heated Steam turns into ice crystals or snow in frigid temperatures, EPE becomes - in direct proportion to its vibrational speed and temperature - various stages of MATTER. Quantum theory ( wave/particle theory) in which electrons can be described as either particles or waves can be readily understood if the vibrational levels and dimension factors are included in the equation. Imagine the dividing li ne between the density of the sea and the density of the atmosphere with the slower vibrational level of the sea representative of the Third dimension, and the higher vibrational level of the atmosphere representing the Nth dimension . Next, allow an undulating wave of EPE - traveling at the speed of light - to flow (fluctuate) between the two dimensions in much the same way a speeding porpoise breaches the waves between surface and water as it races alternately through the air and the sea like a tossed stone skipping atop the surface. In the higher vibrational level of the atmosphere the porpoise will meet very little resistance, but, when it dives beneath the surface, it is momentarily slowed by the density of the water. The same is true when the EPE interacts with the slower vibrational levels of the Third dimension, for as it skips between the two dimensions a fractional part of it is transformed into matter . This slowing and cooling down process allows part of the EPE to form (initially) into discrete sub-atomic particle-matter (quarks, hyperons, neutrinos, photons, gluons, bosons, etc.) then, as it slows and cools still further in Third dimensional space, it next forms protons, electrons and neutrons which in turn, combine into the tiny atoms that eventually form all of the elements in our Universe. It is interesting to note that the atomic masses of each element listed in the periodic tables increase in weight as the vibrational and temperature levels of the EPE slow down. Everything within our enormous Universe is part of a never-ending cycle, and to some degree contrary to the Conservation Law . It is my belief that the cosmological principle is better expressed in the amended 'Steady State' theory than in the 'Singularity' hypothesis. New"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" 24 matter is constantly being formed in the Universe through an almost endless number of inter- dimensional rips and tears between the dimensions. However, as it is presently being produced at a faster rate than it is being returned to the Nth Dimension via the so-called ‘ Black Holes ’ , it has added fuel for the ‘ Big Bang ’ theorists to play with as it agrees, in part, with their ‘ expanding Universe ’ theory. These proponents of the ‘ Big Bang ’ hypothesis claimed they had absolute proof of the theory when two Bell engineers (A. Penzias and R. Wilson) accidentally discovered background radiation ('White Noise') coming from all corners of space at a relatively uniform rate. This was hailed as being 'residual micro-wave radiation' that came originally from the 'The Big Bang' and used to bolster and promote their beliefs. But it is an erroneous theory. This background radiation is a phenomenon caused by the never ending process of creation and return ! It is the ‘ sound ’ of the ESSENCE OF PURE ENERGY leaking into the Third dimension from the Nth dimension and being converted into MATTER . After a time, as the vibrational levels and temperatures slow still further, a ‘ like-to- like ’ attractive force , causes the newly formed matter to be drawn together to coalesce into increasingly heavier and more dense forms of MASS which - over billions of years - gravity forms into either mega or dwarf stars. These eventually burn out and become either ‘ mini' or 'mega' black holes . It within these black holes that the forces of gravity increase the temperature of the mass to the levels of vibration above that of light thereby converting the mass-matter back into EPE for return to the Nth dimension. The cycle is then complete. It cannot be stressed too strongly that our Universe is no more than a single dimension in a possible infinite number of other dimensions. We refer to it as the dimension of the Third, and it is within this dimension that our physical reality exists. Our Third dimensional reality is tentatively ‘ held in place' solely by the boundary levels of vibration ’ , for each level of vibration is a boundary that separates one dimension from another"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 25 whenever an interface occurs.

As stated earlier, “ The limits of infinity lie within the Third dimension, ” not beyond.

We said - we stated - that we are a mirror-image of Earth that will take you time to achieve.\" I saw the subtle difference and accepted what he was saying. My next question was based on the recent reading I had done regarding the alleged abductions of many people by the occupants of UFO's. As many of you reader s may know, under hypnosis, a number of the abductees have described their abductors as being either little pallid grey bald creatures with large obsidian eyes, or as being exceptionally tall, fair-haired people with high foreheads and keen blue-grey eyes. I wanted to know if The M onitor's physical make-up resembled either of these descriptions. \"Your physical being - your physical make-up - is quite different to that of Earth people,\" I stated. \"Why is this so?\" \"Our physical make-up can be manifested in anyway we choose,\" he replied. \"Why do you assume that we visually take on a very different appearance?\" \"Because of the number of people who claim to have seen you.\" I replied. \"The Earth people, with whom you have made contact, describe y ou as vastly different creatures to that of"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 28 man,\" I told him. \"If you associate those with eyes that are 'sensors', then you associate with the 'robot-condition'.\" I interpreted that to mean he was referring to t he 'Little Grey Men' as being a type of robot - possibly clones - or, as science fiction writers would have us believe, Androids. I asked him to describe the physical appearance of The Monitors when they enter (or manifest) within our Third dimensional space. \"Whatsoever energy we find,\" he responded, \"then do we imitate.\" \"Why have you been conducting experiments with humankind?\" I asked him bluntly. \"Why have you been abducting, examining, and exper imenting with human beings? What is the purpose of this?\" \"You are in error. We have no such contact with humankind. You speak of the robots. You speak now of those that do not monitor your Earth but invade it,\" he said. \"Are they of a different dimension to yours?\" I asked. \"They are,\" he replied. \"The ones you perceive are of a different Galaxy. We - as yet - are not perceived by you.\" \"Then who are the ones who have been perceived by us?\" I asked, \"Who are the very tall, fair, blue-eyed Spacemen - or 'Star People' - some Earth people claim to have seen?

I told him that I could sense a subtle change between this communication and previous communications had with an entity we called 'Voice'.

The time for the 'dimensional gates' to be re-aligned is fast approaching, but if the vibration of Earth and Earth's people - and Earth's mind - is not raised . . . his voice began to falter, (What I am saying is) if the consciousness is not raised, you will bring to yourselves those who would seek dominat ion rather than progression.

Man has taken that which was to have been your greatest gift and abused it to the ultimate, therefore it has turned upon itself. You have brought upon yourselves a regression rather than a progression, and this cannot be allowed to continue.\" He paused for a long moment before continuing. \"Our immediate intervention upon the Earth has made it necessary for us to use whatever means we can to assist those who reach out to us (asking us) to make changes within the Earth's structure and within the minds of man.\" As he ended the sentence, I knew, in my own mind, that there was absolutely no doubt that what he was saying was true. We, on Earth, need every bit of help we can get IF this planet is to survive the next few years. But what will happen to all of us when the events of today are combined with the terrible events that we know will follow tomorrow? This warning is almost identical to the warning we had been given by another channeled Voice while working on our first book a number of years ago.

At that time, I thought I may have a partial answer to this space-time-travel question, so I raised the point with Monitor to hear what he had to say about it. \"As you are aware,\" I began, \"in our Third dimensional state, it would take far longer than the life-spans of many generations of Earth people to reach another star system or galaxy. Even our closest galaxy - Andromeda - lies approximately 2 .2 million light years away, a distance that - even if we could attain the speed of light - would still take us at over two million years to reach.

However, there is, and was . . . and is in fact soon to be . . . a change in the vibration of Earth which makes ‘ dimensional gates ' (as you understand them) accessible to changing matter which you consider so defined. \"Indeed,\" he went on, \"were you to look at a (physical) body structure, is it not true that, at some point, you recognize it is ma tter (made up from) atoms? Therefore it is not of great difficulty to change the surrounding energy field - being that of light - into a change within the body structure? The energy which you consider permanent?\" \"Yes, this I understand,\" I replied, \"and I realize there are possibly many ways of doing it.\" At that specific time, I had a need to talk to a physicist to further develop several of the ideas pertaining to the Essence of Pure Energy theory and the creation of Mass-Matter that had"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" 37 recently been running through my mind. What Monitor was now saying would, I felt sure, parallel this theory and, perhaps, offer a very sound and logical explanation for inter-galactic travel. It would also explain why (and how) it would be possible for inter-dimensional travel as well. It suddenly dawned on me that Monitor might possibly be able to answer all of the questions I had wanted to fire at a physicist. I asked if he would answer my questions on the subject. \"Pose your questions,\" he replied. I gave a brief description of my hypotheses and outlined a new theory in which a dividing line between two dimensions is the vibrational level shared by both. I went on to suggest that by increasing or decreasing the vibrational levels within the electromagnetic field surrounding each state, it might be possible to physically move from one dimension to another. He listened attentively to what I had to say before I asked if my theory was in any way correct. \"Yes, it is correct in your understanding,\" he replied. Pleased by the confirmation, I continued the discussion for a short while before broaching my premise that explained where, and how, anti-ma tter is formed during the vibrational process, and how any structure may be atomically 'disintegrated' thereby allowing it to pass - as pure energy - into another dimension. Monitor heard me out before continuing to expand on the subject. \"The material body is a 'reflectionary ' state of light- energy,\" he explained. \"Once you recognize the frequency at which the material remain s in form and shape, it is by merely undoing of same that makes that body 'transportable' to any dimension. Does this clarify the understanding for you?\" He asked. As he was speaking, I had mental image of Spock and Captain Kirk aboard the 'Starship Enterprise', entering the Transporter Room and asking Scotty to ‘ beam them down ’ to somewhere or other. And yet - as far-out as it may seem - the whole process is incredibly logical.

By simply lowering a frequency level to create an infinite number of vibrational patterns, all manner of forms may be made. Why is this so difficult to understand?

You are merely a reflection of light in bodily form.\" \"Then what about particle matter?\" I asked. \"Particle matter is a reflection of the energy of light. When you talk of 'created', you understand it in a Third dimensional form,\" he replied. \"We would offer you that particle matter is, once again, a Third dimensional form of the energy which you call Thought Processing.\" \"Fine, ” I responded, “ then let's develop that. What is a 'Thought Process?\" \"(It is) an energy that is attracted by material matter - such as the brain - where it is forced through the brain to become matter. Thought processes are governed by mind. Mind and personality are the sacred source,\" he explained, \"Sacred, in your understanding, is possibly indefinable, yet definable.\" \"Then let us take a 'Pure Mind' - a pure mind that has nothing to do with the personality of any individual within the Third dimension. Can you describe just what this pure mind - the essence of mind - really is?\" I asked. \"The essence of mind,\" he replied, \"is the reflection of light. It is Creation .\" \"Then what, by your definition, is the 'essence of pure light?'\" I asked. \"It is that which cannot be altered. It is, and was, and ever shall be.\" It wasn't quite the answer I was looking for so I moved on to a subject I knew many people would like answers to: Why are they - the alien Star People - here? Why has Earth - of all places in the Universe - been visited by so m any Alien-beings over the centuries? \"Your Earth was in balance with your Sun and t hat which you know as your Moon, and that"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" 39 which would have appeared as another duplicate of your Moon,\" he said. \"It was in perfect balance, therefore it was possible (during that time) to experience Third dimensional form. And, having thus experienced, return to whichever form that was compatible with its life-source. ” \"There were many who came from other galaxies to experience this,\" he told me, \"and many (who) also came to use Earth's vibration as an energy field. It was also used as a healing structure of life-forms and also, it was used to make mani fest an energy for craft - spacecraft, as you have called them - that which was in the Earth and above the Earth.\" I wasn't exactly sure of what he meant by this, and I was about to question him about it when he continued. \"Perfect balance was the key to the planet Earth. However, due to Earth's rate of progress within the Universal structure, there was a slowing of the vibratory force causing it to gather unto itself 'density'.\" He paused for a few moments, then added, \"The balance became perfect.\" It should be noted here that the term 'density' had been used many, many times in 'The Skull Speaks' in reference to our Earth which the Entities always referred to as 'The Small Dense Planet'. Further, since the term 'density' also refers to a stage of matter created by the slowing down of vibrational levels, it implies that we - mankind and other animal life forms - are existing in a much lower vibrational level than our more refined, higher vibrational and further advanced neighbors. Monitor continued his dissertation. \"There was also a time of destruction from a Universal source: the collapse of that which was closest to you. . . your Moon. \"There was - upon your Moon - a life-force structure of its own. And also upon the planet which accompanied your moon,\" he said. \"When the deterioration and collapse began, those who were within the atmospheric-change, deigned to stay.

You had separated from them and taken (upon) yourselves emotional states that strove to separate you from them, for they were not familiar (with) y ourselves and your origins. . . \" he seemed to be searching for the right phrase. . . \"In fact,\" he continued, \"they represent - even now - a barrier to your consciousness being fully awakened. \"We come looking for the remnants (of this time). . . or, as you might structure it, (looking for) our 'genetic link' to you, as do others,\" he said. As he related the history of these life-forms coming to this planet during its so-called 'balanced state', it slowly dawned on me that this was, in all probability, how 'intelligent life' first arrived here. Not in physical form, but as 'soul -spirit-energy' entities who were seeking a balanced"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" 41 vibrational state of existence as a means of 'relaxation and rehabilitation' - in much the same way we might visit a spa or hot-spring to regenerate our physical bodies and rejuvenate our minds. These ethereal beings were able to 'manifest' into a physical form in order to experience Third dimensional reality along with the emotional and sensory passions of the flesh. And, from what Monitor was telling us, it was during one of these 'R&R' visits that the dimensional 'gates' closed around them, blocking their return to their source of origin, and trapping their incorporeal beings within the confines of an often hostile planet Earth. These 'soul-spirit' entit ies unable to escape the magnetic fields that now encompassed the planet attempted to either manifest into - or meld with - various life-forms in order to survive their accidental incarceration. Most tried, but failed. A handful succeeded. A form of hysteria gripped many of these soul-spirits, and because of the negativity and confusion this created, it created warped and twisted forms upon the Earth. However, at this time, there were many different soul-spirit entities on Earth from many different parts of the Universe. At the time the dimensional gates began to close, each of these groups manifested into different forms. Our Monitor and his group of 'Star People' have now returned to this planet to search out their own 'genetic links' in the hope that they - along with other 'Space People' from different planets and galaxies - might, when the dimensional ' gates ' become aligned and open, be able to help their genetically linked soul-mates escape back to their sources of origin. \"You say that you have come back. By what mode of travel did you return to this planet?\" I asked him. \"How are you going to manifest yourselves again on Earth?\" \"We have (done), and we (still) do, manifest our selves upon this planet in Third dimensional form,\" he replied. \"That which you have deemed to be spacecraft are a part of this manifestation. Indeed, within the Earth lie remnants of many of our spacecraft as well as other ships of interplanetary travel,\" he said."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" 42 I saw this as an opening to learn more about their craft and took it. \"May we get technical for a moment regardi ng your ships and mode of travel?\" I asked. \"Pose your question,\" he replied. \"What is the motive power aboard your ships - your craft? How does it work? Can you give us a brief description of the type of propulsion forces you use?\" \"Within the light is the 'energy-sustenance' we require,\" he replied. \"This can be collected and stored (like) the sunlight in your re-generators (batteries) for your use. We take the Universal energy of light and (use) the essence of this energy to propel our craft. His reply puzzled me. \"We do know that light is energy, and that energy can be light,\" I said. \"Light can be mass, and we are aware that it can be converted from one form into another. We do not know, however, how you do it. How do you overcome gravity?\" I a sked, \"What is your method of overcoming the forces of gravity? Obviously, your craft are capable of doing this, but how do you do it?\" \"This is a form of reflected light energy. We bend the spectrum of light, as you understand it.\" \"Is this 'bending' done prismatically?\" I asked, feeling, as I did so, that I was about to be given another run around', \"or do you do it gravit ationally? Exactly how is the light 'bent'?\" \"The light is bent by changing its frequency,\" he answered. \"The Earth itself generates a frequency.\" \"We do know that every atom, every particle of matter, has its fingerprint. . . its own vibrational frequency,\" I told him. \"And that these particles - either collectively or individually - vibrate at different resonances.\" \"You're incorrect,\" he said. \"Then please correct me,\" I replied. \"We emphasize 'reflected light',\" he insisted."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" 43 \"Reflected? By what?\" \"You merely have the capabilities of measuring reflected light.\" \"I'm afraid I don't understand what you're saying,\" I told him. \"Your Earth reflects . . .\" he began. \"Yes, the sunlight, as does the Moon.\" \"This also is incorrect in our understanding. However, it is correct in your understanding,\" he replied. \"Your science will soon be at a point of understanding that there is a difference between Universal Light and reflected sunlight. You talk of light when talking only of your Sun,\" he insisted. \"We do not speak of the same light source. The source of light we speak of is direct, not reflected.\" \"But there are many sources in our Universe that produce light,\" I told him. \"Stars - which are suns in themselves - of which, there are countless billions of trillions visible to us.\" \"Correct,\" he replied. \"Each one is a Sun - a light-emitting body.\" \"Only Earth is a reflector,\" he stated. \"Why only Earth?\" I asked. \"In this dimension - in this structure - it was necessary for balance within this Universe,\" he explained. \"If you look within your mind you will, as of now, remember a time when there was more reflected light upon the Earth.\" This, of course, is true. Even in my lifetime, I can remember a world that was far brighter and less polluted than it is today. We used to be able to look up at night and see the stars - the whole of the visible Milky Way - without having to peer through a cloud of petroleum-fumed smog. But suddenly it then dawned upon me that Monitor was not talking about that, instead, he was addressing a far deeper memory, a memory of my origins, a time when the Earth was pure and pristine and man had not yet left his mark upon its face. I asked him if it was, indeed, a distant memory he was talking about."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" 44 \"Yes,\" he said, \"A distant memory. A memory of your origin. You must remember that within your own essence the awakening has begun, therefore allow that which you call your imagination to remind you,\" he responded. \"Again we stress there is a difference between 'reflected light' and the pure essence of light, for the energy fields - and the keys for which you look - are there.\" He paused for a moment before going on. \"We do not purposely hide these (truths), or disguise them, for we are permitted to offer to all who seek when you understand to seek it.\" I thanked him for his co-operation and the information he had just imparted. However, within my own mind I wasn't sure that I was ready to accept at face value, all that had been given. I did not completely understand the 'reflected light' concept, nor get any sort of handle on just how to find the elusive answers to what I believed was some sort of riddle. I decided to wait until some intuitive flash brought a solution. I changed the subject. \"Let us talk now of life and death,\" I said, \"and why it is that all of mankind - when born on here Earth (however many times that may be) - is born with little or no memory of whence he has come, why he is here, or anything else about his former lifetimes. A veil drops over one's memory and both past and future are gone. Why is this so?\" I asked. \"It is simply your chosen way of allowing the understanding and the purification process to take place,\" he replied. \"At the time when consciousness could manifest at will within Third dimensional form, everything was known and remembered. However, at the time of change upon the Earth, consciousness took with itself a negative form, that which you call 'emotion'.\" He waited for this to sink in before continuing. \"This was used - and is still used - to enslave you and to keep you from reaching the essence (of being) and of knowing your true identities. \"When we come and manifest in the Third dimension, we are looking to understand the greatest barrier of all; the emotion you deem to call 'fear',\" he said. \"For until we have a complete understanding of this emotion, we must remain poised and aloof, only revealing ourselves to those"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" 45 who recognize that we and they are one.\" \"But you have already reveal ed yourselves. . . all over the world,\" I pointed out. \"We reveal ourselves (primarily) to try to find the genetic links that have now established themselves in the consciousness that you regar d as Earth-beings,\" he explained. \"We again wish you to understand that you talk now not of single visitations. There were many, and (still are) many of these conscious nesses that were trapped at the time of change. \"We offer you this thought,\" he continued, \"Those who were less advanced in their fear, manifest themselves into animal life.\" I asked him if he would define 'animal life' for me, wondering, at the time, whether or not he meant animals that were, biblically speaking, 'of the beast'. His response was most interesting. \"We would offer you this,\" he said. \"Consciousness in flight, desperation, fear (or) anger is a nucleus surrounded by a density - a density foreign to its understanding. And so, now trapped within the Earth, it seeks to manifest itself. It took the energy forms which were of the Earth and exploded into consciousness - a consciousness it was not compatible with - so that only a mutant strain of that consciousness became manifest. Such were your creatures that are now extinct, for the consciousness could not hold that vibration and left. Now fragmented, it became weaker and even more vulnerable to the densities of emotions. \"Thereafter, life-forms (emerged) within th e Universe whose involvement and understanding are not all of 'One'. However, in the Universal Law, all (must) understand that which is regarded as Freewill. Once again, the consciousness tried to manifest and sought to bend energy into a dimensional form that was not strong enough. ” \"At that time, you had upon your Earth your so-called 'monsters' - a so-called mutant strain of man (a Neanderthal? ) - and even when that consciousness refined somewhat, you then had a manifestation in animal life which coul d converse with your Primitives. ” \"We would offer you that, even now, that which you call the dolphin is a manifestation of"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" 46 consciousness of another planet that is within your Galaxy.\" This, to me, is a most intriguing thought. We have so much to learn about - and from - dolphins and some other species of the whale family. I cast aside this reverie and returned to Monitor. \"But isn't everything a manifestation of a thought form?\" I asked. \"A thought form is not a 'consciousness',\" he explained. \"We talk now of that which has a degree of intelligence. Soon the consciousness of this planet that is manifest in that animal life (the dolphin) will withdraw, for it has not been satisfactory.\" I confess that this thought saddens me a great deal. To me, the Dolphin is one of the most beautiful creatures on our planet. It is an intelligence that is almost totally free and un-encumbered by either worldly trappings or possessions. It goes w here it wants when it wants, and travels as part of a small, closely knit family group. However, if, as our Monitor has told us, we - or our soul-spirits - are trapped upon this planet, then the dolphins (along with a whole slew of other intelligent creatures) must also be trapped. If this is so, then, sad though it may be, I will not begrudge them their escape when the dimensional 'gates' re-open and set them free. \"May we talk about reincarnation for a moment?\" I asked. \"You have spoken of (our soul- spirits) as having 'manifested' on Earth in the mold of mankind and then, when the ‘ Gates ’ closed, we became trapped within our physical bodies for life-span after life-span . Isn't this something we do voluntarily each time we return to human form?\" \"It was - before the time of change - a pleasurable undertaking, for there was no understanding of confinement,\" he replied. \"One could use the energies of Earth to experience (many different things). However, once the changes took place within, and upon, the Earth, there was a feeling of separation.\" He singled me out, personally, for his next few words of wisdom. \"Much of your strife - and we speak now of your personal life, of you who questions - has"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" 47 been due to the essence of the self remembering the separation. \"The separation manifested itself negatively and you have continued to separate and separate and separate,\" he told me. \"For whatsoever negativity is within the minds of man becomes a manifestation far more easily upon the Earth than that which is of the highest essence. The understanding of reincarnation is simply due to the consciousness blending itself with the 'Being' (the physical form into which it manifests) and the other 'Beings' (it becomes through various incarnations) here upon Earth. There were those whose consciousness vibrated at a lower level. They were the first to take on form.\" He paused for a long moment before continuing this dissertation on reincarnation. \"Your consciousness kept on waiting and waiting for an opportunity to manifest,\" he explained, \"However, once you found y ourself within the 'Gross Being' form, you sought to purify, to enlighten, and so it was necessary for the mind to undergo the birth, the death. . . the birth, the death. Each time your higher essence returned to the next dimension (the dimension man has come to refer to as 'Heaven') it became stronger and stronger, always monitored and looked after by those who sought to stay close and witness the progress. \"For even then,\" he said, \"it was known that the time of change would once again take place within this Galaxy and the ‘ Gates ’ would again be aligned. It is to this end that we now make ourselves known to you by deed. We are here to reawaken you.\" If we are 'All -as-One', I wondered, is there still room for individuality in a soul-spirit? I tossed the question to Monitor. \"Is there such a thing as an individual Soul?\" I asked. \"There is the individuality of personality,\" he replied. \"Then would you describe what happens to the Soul when it leaves the physical plane. What exactly happens to that Soul?\" \"It resides in the closest dimension to the Earth where it remembers and collects its past"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" 48 personalities,\" he answered, \"And, where there has been a refining and a progression, it allows more memory of its true identity to be opened and brought with it into its next Earth life - to be opened and remembered.\" \"This may seem repetitious, but to what purpose - to what ultimate purpose - is the whole process being enacted?\" I asked. \"The ultimate purpose of the Soul would be - should it so desire or choose - to return or stay. Freewill is the ultimate purpose of the Soul.\" \"Return to where? To what?\" \"To whichever life-form it originally came from,\" he replied. \"Is this an infinite, or a finite process?\" I asked. \"You would term it 'infinite' but, in your understanding, it would be 'finite'.\" \"Then let us assume that there is an infinite number of worlds - solar systems, planets - within an infinite Universe. And, within these solar systems, are near replicas and similar conditions to our Earth. Is it possible for the Soul to go to any - or all - of these worlds?\" \"To all,\" he replied, \"Freewill is the ultimate.\" \"Then why is Earth so special?\" \"We would remind you that Earth is but a stepping stone - a stop between many experiences,\" he replied. \"Then what is the fate - the immediate fate - of all humanity on this planet?\" I asked, then hastily added, \". . . within the next ten to fifteen years?\" \"Those whose awakening has been completed will recognize and understand who and what they are. Should they choose to do so, they will l eave Earth,\" he replied. \"Those who live within the body-structure and command (unto) themselves fear, will remain - still trapped - between the Earth structures. “ They who have regressed to a point where t hey cannot be reached (the Gross-Beings) will"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" 49 seek to stay.

Other than the fact it was carved from crystal, it had little to do with her being able to reach other- dimensional entities. After a couple of test runs with a number of different crystalline structures, she found that her own gift was all she needed to make contact with The Monitors - our new source of knowledge. For the first session we borrowed a very large chunk of pure Brazilian quartz crystal from a friend and using it as the oscillatory amplifier, Carole was able to slip easily into a trance-channel state and begin the process of searching for the 'right' channel. It was while she was 'twiddling the dial' - looking for the highest vibrational frequency she could find - that she came across an 'entity' who claimed to have been a physicist during a recent incarnation here on Earth. This character had a delightful sense of humor imbedded in a warm and rich personality, and I felt very much at ease as he listened attentively to my questions before responding with answers that were both logical, philosophical and straight to the point. I should point out that during the past several months prior to this session, my mind had been inundated with data relating to our physical world - new ideas, theories, and other miscellaneous concepts - and, knowing very little about any of these subjects, I had buried myself in books and articles searching fo r information and answers to a couple of strange theories that had recently formed in the deep recesses of my mind. I was a tad unsure as to whether or not they were"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":" 51 sufficiently developed for presentation to someone who knew far more about the subject matter than I, yet decided I would test some of the concepts on this delightful, ‘ non-physical Physicist, and see where they might lead. With nothing to lose, I gave it a shot. \"I believe that dimensions, as we know them, are no more than vibrational levels in which different realities exist, and may be entered or exited simply by altering the vibrational state in and around oneself. Is this correct?\" \"Yes,\" he replied. \"Cause affects matter. I would agree with your thinking on this.\" Bolstered by his response, I asked my next question which had to do with the theory of 'Creation ’ which, as most readers know, relates to both the beginning of the Universe and the beginning of Time. This hypothesis, now known as 'The Big Bang Theory', postulates that everything in the Universe - all galaxies, stars, planets matter and 'dark' matter - began from an unbelievably minuscule point in space scientists now refer to as a 'singularity '. According to this theory, a single point in space - no larger than a pinhead - exploded into empty space and became the whole Universe as we know it. To me, the concept of an infinitely minuscule point of nothingness - where all matter within our Universe began - is totally out of whack with everything else in our psychical world. It is contradictory to the concept of symmetry that pervades throughout the entire Cosmos and more to the point, was , at the time , counter to the flood of 'intelligence' being channeled into my mind. I posed the loaded question to my new-found non-physical ‘ Physicist ’ friend. \"Did our Universe begin with the so-called ‘ Big Bang ’ ?\" I asked. \"No,\" he replied quite emphatically, \"it started - or rather let me offer you another word - it ' collapsed ', with the changing of the Earth's vibration in the Universe.\" His answer was, in my opinion, totally off-the-wall and hard to accept. After all, our Earth is but a minuscule, insignificant planet in a remote section of a medium sized galaxy (the Milky Way) located in the vastness of a possibly endless Universe. How could it possibly have any effect on the"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" 52 birth or collapse of the entire Universe? \"It is the Earth's vibration,\" he said, sensing my doubts. \"Let me explain 'matter'. “ We have come to realize that it is only when it (energy) is 'collective' that we term it 'matter'. In fact this, whilst being true, is also untrue. For we must understand that in whatever (Third dimensional) space we find ourselves, there is matter. Our understanding of matter must be looked at closely.\" \"Correct me if I'm wrong,\" I interjected, \"but isn't Light a form of converted energy? Isn't it, in fact, a part of the Essence of Pure Energy ?\" \"Correct,\" he replied. \"For, if we were to slow the vibrational level of this Essence of Pure Energy down. . . ” \". . . You have light,\" he said. \". . . .And if we slow the vibrational level of light ?\" \"Yes, yes! If you slow the (vibration of) the pure essence of energy, you have light. And if you slow the light. . . \" \". . . You have matter,\" I concluded. \"Exactly !\" He sounded excited, like a schoolboy on the edge of his chair. \"So the division - the dimensional division - between the Essence of Pure Energy and Light and Matter, is no more than a level of vibration? Am I right?\" I asked. \"This is correct in essence, yes. But again I will stress to you that our understanding of 'matter' is only half of the reality.\" \"You are talking about particle physics?\". \"Correct.\" \"And you are suggesting that true 'matter' is only half of the particle?\" \"That is correct,\" he replied. \"Then I assume the other half is 'Anti-Matter'?\""},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" 53 He chuckled gleefully and, through Carole, nodded pointedly. \"You are nodding,\" I chided, \"I assume you are in agreement?\" \"Ahaah!\" he laughed, good-naturedly. \"Am I right?\" I insisted. \"Yes, indeed, you are!\" He seemed relaxed and in a highly approachable frame of mind, so I decided to get his views on a variety of subjects that I had ben pursuing since the publication of ‘ The Skull Speaks ’ . \"Everything that exists physically on Earth, exists because of our star, the Sun. Nothing could exist without the Sun's radianc e - in the form of electromagnetic radiation and light - as it goes through the process of creating MASS from what I call, the Essence of Pure Energy . This would hold true for each and every star-sun complex in our Universe with life-sustaining planetary systems around it. Would you agree with this?\" \"For physical matter?\" He asked. \"Yes. But only Third dimensional life,\" I replied. \"I would answer 'yes'.\" He said. \"Then if the stars - or the suns - are the creators and the sustainers of all physical life,\" I went on \"they are all 'gods'.\" \"Hmm!\" said my new non-physical friend, obv iously mulling my question over in his disembodied mind. \"But it doesn't answer the question regarding the ‘ God ’ of the other dimensions. What sort of 'religious' belief system is there in your present dimension,\" I asked. \"Who - or what - is God?\" \"In that dimension?\" \"Yes. In the dimension in which - for want of a better word - you are now residing?\" \"In the 'space' that I find my consciousness, the concept of 'religion' as I have known it upon the Earth, does not exist, ” he said. He corrected himself. “ Or, I should say, when I walked upon the"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" 54 Earth. For, indeed, I do not wish to imply that I am 'spinning crazily' around in some other Universe.\" \"Are you, perhaps, in a parallel Universe?\" I asked. \"In so far as I can understand, I am more of Earth than you . For you only occupy space - and a very small amount of space. However, to return to your previous question, the concept of religion. From where I view it now - religion has no existence. The concept of 'God' - which I was trained to understand - has no existence. It is my belief that man searching for 'man' outside of himself has created the 'God' and religion you speak of.\" He had, in my opinion, made a point which closely paralleled my own thinking, and I recalled that Voltaire had once written; 'If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him ’ . My Friend continued. \"In this dimension (the one I am now in) one understands the concept of 'ALL ' . There is no separation between God and Man. There is no 'outside'. . . there is no 'inside'. . . it is one continuous vibration of energy,\" he said. He paused for a moment before continuing. \"When you separate from this dimension to come as close to you as I do today, the old ideas - the old theories - cling very fast to one and it is like brushing dust away to re-release those old ideas and theories before one can enter back into the 'Oneness'.\" \"And yet you physicists - above all others - were more responsible for unlocking the atomic Pandora's Box than anyone else. You gave the world the secrets of matter and energy. Do you see things so very differently now? Was what you did, right or wrong?\" I asked him. \"Put in that perspective, one would quickly say we were in error. However, to vindicate the personality that was me, I will add that, for the time and the space I was right (in unlocking the secret of the atom),\" he said. \"You cannot take without you place something there for man - for human-beings - to reach for. In this time - and again, 'time' is used in the context you will understand - it was necessary that the information that wasn't given to man was that which surpassed our earlier discoveries . These minds - the minds of scientists collectively - must"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" 55 constantly be restricted until their refinement is of no hazardous vibration to the Universe. And I speak not of one Universe, but of many.\" \"Do all Universes touch? Do they interact with each other?\" \"Yes, of course. There, if anywhere, would be the closest concept of 'God',\" he replied. \"Is the energy - and here I'm talking about the pure essence of energy - the same throughout all dimensions? ” , I asked. \"In essence, yes,\" he replied. \"I would like to draw an analogy between multi-dimensions and a child blowing soap bubbles through one of those wire loops. Each bubble blown is a Universe or dimension in itself, ” I explained. “ Now, since it is possible to blow a variety of bubbles - that is, bubbles within bubbles, bubbles that attach to other bubbles, bubbles that gather around bubbles; big bubbles, little bubbles, and so on - would this, in anyway, describe the interaction between dimensions?\" \"A bubble without a bubble?\" He smiled. \"Yes. A bubble without a membrane,\" I replied. \"Exactly!\" He chuckled to himself. \"What fun you will have putting this down on paper!\" \"I'm having fun now,\" I assured him. \"They will either pickle your br ain, too, or lock you away!\" \"Don't worry about my brain, ” I told him. “ I'll be locked away!\" \"Better that, than to have your brain kept in a jam-jar,\" he laughed. \"You no longer had need of yours,\" I quipped. \"Neither had they!\" He snorted, and we both laughed heartily. \"Very well put, my friend. Very well put!\" He continued to laugh and shake his head at his own jest, obviously appreciating the moment. \"Most amusing, most amusing!\" He chortl ed, and I could easily visualize my new-found"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" 56 friend wiping tears of laughter from his eyes the way very old men so often do. When the laughter subsided, he nodded his head in my direction. \"Fascinating! Truly fascinating!\" He said. I asked him if he felt there was a sense of religion in any of the points we had been discussing - most especially the dimensional concept. He mulled it over for a few moments. \"Is there religion?\" He said, more to himself than to me. \"Is there a 'God' within it all?\" I asked. \"Your understanding of 'God'?\" He asked. \"Man's understanding?\" \"No,\" I replied. \" Your understanding of 'God'.\" \"Far more than any man-made God,\" he replied. Around the time Carole and I became involved in these sessions, there had been a great deal in the Press and other media outlets about both the successes and failures of ‘ Cold Fusion ’ alternative energy research. As many readers will recall, there were a number of chemists, nuclear scientists and others who had been trying to duplicate the experiments carried out by Stanley Pons, of the University of Utah, and Ma rtin Fleischmann, of the University of South- hampton in the U.K., when they first broke the news of their success in unlocking energy with their table-top experiments in ‘ cold ’ nuclear fusion. Other scientists had tried to duplicate their findings but had failed. Why it should work under some test-procedures and not in others was creating an obvious rift between the researchers all over the world. There were some who claimed some limited success, yet the main body of those who tried to prove that the experiments could be duplicated, failed. I gave my disembodied new friend him a brief outline of what Pons and Fleischmann had been up to, and asked him if he thought the process of 'Cold Fusion' was viable. \"Of course it is,\" he replied. \"It gives scientists something to do and keeps them out of our"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":" 57 hair,\" he laughed. \"It may well do that, but it shouldn't be looked at too lightly. It could do this world an incredible amount of good, ” I told him. “ It would rid us of our major source of pollution, and so many of the other things that are destroying our plane t. If it is viable, as you seem to believe it is, will it be allowed to come into being or will it be squashed by the mega-Oil Companies whose vested interests will certainly want to see it killed?\" \"I see you've done your research well,\" he said . \"Those that think they have discovered this (cold-fusion process) have only one way to go, and that is to be very , very vocal about it. However, I fear that man's greed will override man's spiritual endeavors,\" he added rather sadly. What he had just said (and this was back in 1989) would, in all probability, be exactly what was about to happen to 'Cold Fusion'. It would die because the vested interests of the Gross- Beings who run the petroleum industry would kill it. Billions upon billions of dollars are invested in petroleum, and the petroleum related industries: Automobile manufacturers; plastics companies; arms factories - plus the myriad of ancillary industries related to (and dependent on) our oil-petroleum-functioning society. OPEC and the Multi-National corporate giants cannot afford to allow the ‘ cold-fusion ’ process to happen, and we will no-doubt hear the dying flutter of wings in the West as the project does its swan song. The only hope for such a revolutionary new idea as Cold Fusion may lie in the hands of Russia, India, China, or possibly Japan. Somewhere - anywhere - beyond the reach of the avaricious and powerful moguls of the West who run their corporate giants with no real care for the well-being of our planet unless a bountiful profit can be made from it. Think Exxon Valdez. . . think Alaska. . . think Wildlife, and then think of the agricultural practice of Mono-culture or the Clear- cutting of Rain Forests, the Rape of the Earth . . . and the endless, mindless processes that pollute our land and oceans.

It seems that The Monitors and other Star-People are unable to comprehend our feelings of fear in light of our religious teachings and our genetic link with our beginnings here on Earth. They had thought that, through the process of reincarnating, the fear-emotion factor would have been wiped out completely from our minds. Instead, they are surprised to discover it has become even more deeply entrenched within our psyche. They want to know why, in spite of the teachings of our Prophets about the continuity of the soul-spirit, we still fear death? They are asking, \"How can this be so? Surely we should have learned, for example, that if man couldn't kill t he Christ figure, then our fear of death would have been removed forever?\" As Carole is completely ‘ out of it ’ during these trance-channel sessions, I did my best to explain to her what I had told Monitor: That fear was an instinctual reac tion and was, indeed, one of the most basic emotions associated with animal behavior in the never-ending process of survival. I also told her I had read some material on the pioneer work in the behavioral sciences by a Dr Paul MacLean, of the University of Maryland, who, I believe, first discovered that within the very core of our brain, buried beneath the cerebral cortex, lies a small pea-sized nodule he named the 'Reptilian Brain' or 'R-Complex'. This, he believ ed, was the seat of all instinctual animal response mechanisms. This 'Primal-Core Brain ' as I have come to call it, is the location of the 'fear-factor' (the trigger-mechanism to fear-reaction) that s ends the adrenalin pouring th rough our arteries, and"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" 60 prepares us for the fight-or-flight response necessary for on-going survival. This applies, I believe, to any species in any hostile environment, be it eit her in a jungle, or the dog-eat-dog world in which we humans exist. Carole immediately grasped the concept, but added that The Monitors didn't appear to understand mankind in this area at all, so I suggested that maybe I should attempt to enlighten them on the primal-core findings in order to gi ve them a logical explanation for our behavior. She then surprised me by saying that that was exactly what they had been saying to her: \"Help us, please help us in our understanding of man.\" If this was to be part of our mandate, then so be it. We were learning an incredible amount from The Monitors, maybe - just maybe - we c ould pass along what little knowledge we do have in return. I decided that I would raise the subject at our next session, - * - * - * - After we had begun the session and Carole had reached a deep enough state to channel through to The Monitors, I opened my remarks with a lead-in introduction to the 'fear-factor'. \"You have expressed concern over the fee lings of fear you have encountered when dealing with mankind,\" I said. \"Would you like to expound on this?\" \"Concept and understanding,\" he countered. \"You find this difficult to understand?\" I asked. \"We do.\" \"Can I help, in anyway, with a little information?\" \"Proceed.\" \"Fear is an integral part of the physical survival instinct within our human race,\" I said, then went on to describe the physical aspects of the prim al-core from my recollection of what little I had"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" 61 read of Dr MacLean's findings. I added that instinctual fear often completely overrules man's intellectual or rational abilities - sometimes almost totally immobilizing a person in both a physical and psychological sense. I continued: \"Civilized man, over the centuries, has sought to overcome his more primitive instincts in some areas, but, for the most part, this has been almost impossible to achieve. Does that help clarify it in any way?\" \"We understand the working of the human brain. We understand the reaction,\" Monitor replied. \"We are at a loss to understand the concept of destruction. Do you, then, inform us that the mind so associates itself with bodily form that it has become completely dominated by it?\" He asked. \"I wouldn't say it has been completely dominated, ” I answered. “ Intelligent mankind, in very small numbers, is slowly working his way out of the abyss of primitive being. Intellect, to a fair degree, rules us in our day-to-day dealings with each other in many of our so-called 'civilized' societies, but it is only when our emotions are activated, excited or stimulated, that the intellect is pushed to one side and our primitive instincts take over. \"The primal-core factor that lies within our brains - and within all animal brains with few possible exceptions - is the single underlying fa ctor behind most of the problems created by man himself. It is the root cause behind lust, greed, anger, spite, aggression, hatred, jealousy, intolerance, cruelty, dominance, territorial disputes, inter-racial hostilities and wars. It helps reinforce man's devious ways - his cunning, his lies and deceits - for each of these emotionally rooted traits are directly connected to man's ability to survive in a dog-eat-dog society. Failure to employ these survival 'skills' often means a man will be destroyed by his fellow man.\" \"When you speak of destruction, you speak of the bodily form?\" He asked. \"Yes, indeed. This is all I am talking here - the bodily form,\" I responded, \"For 'fear' is an emotion directly related to the bodily form.\""},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" 62 \"When those who are aware of the continuation of mind and personality cease to have bodily form and pass on, we do not perceive any great anguish,\" Monitor said. \"We have observed that which you term 'dying', and have watched them enter the next dimension. We do not perceive that emotions of negative form are demonstrated amongst them.\" \"This depends largely on the method or process by which the individual dies, “ I explained. “ Whether it is a painful death or a peaceful death. The emotional state just prior to death depends largely in the way a human being is about to exit this world. \"A peaceful death in one's bed is one thing, ” I explained, “ But being tortured, murdered, or killed by some ghastly or painful process, is something else again.\" \"We are observing that 'fear-factor', but still it is beyond our comprehension. This is a development totally outside of that which was to be,\" Monitor said. \"It belongs solely to the Earth dimension. You will not observe this in any other life-forms.\" \"Are you talking about other dimensional life-forms or just Earth life-forms?\" I asked. \"Earth life-forms and dimensional life-forms,\" he replied. \"Are you trying to tell me that you don't see any distress in our animal's lives when they die?\" \"After the moment of separation there is no distress observed,\" he said. \"That may well be true, ' after the moment of separation '. But the emotional experience - for either an animal or a human - depends entirely on the events which precede the actual moment of death. Death could well be welcome relief from a painful and terrifying experience.\" \"We understand, then, that the mind is still imprisoned by bodily form?\" He asked. \"Yes. Right up to the moment of death . . .the moment of separation,\" I told him. \"Why?\" \"Because it is during this time that the mind - through its attachment with, or to, the physical body - is still experiencing and feeling all of the emotions and pain of this Third-dimensional reality,\""},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" 63 I explained. \"Were you not able to leave the body at will?\" He asked. \"You mean me, myself?\" I asked, somewhat surprised at the question. \"As you were?\" \"Not during this lifetime, no,\" I replied. \"I can't do it, but there are some who can. The mind through which you are speaking (Carole) can leave its body at will, but I can't.\" \"There is no fear perceived in this mind,\" M onitor said, meaning that he could sense no fear of the 'other side' within Carole's mind. \"It is the 'unknown-factor ’ that man fears the most,\" I explained. \"There are many 'psychological' fears, also. Some are related to the physical primal-core while others - such as a fear of one's superiors, fear of failure, of heights, water, etcetera, which we refer to as phobias. These - are feelings over which man often has little or no control.\" \"Is it not the intellect that rules?\" \"Indeed, no! The intellect may rationalize a given situation - foresee events and create certain responses - but most often it is our base-instincts that prevail in times of great stress. Much depends on the individual's development of the intellect itself,\" I explained. \"The duality of our existence - our intellectual mind in the form of our soul-spirit, versus our physical body-structure with its built-in instinctual-response mechanisms - can best be described in an analogous way. “ Imagine a wild horse - a mustang or bronco - as representing our human physical body. Next, try and imagine our Soul-Spirit as a Cowboy or Bronco-buster out to capture, break, and tame this wild creature for his own personal use. \"Although rebellious at first, the wild horse is gradually broken to the saddle and subdued to a point where the Cowboy-cum-Bronco-Buster ( the Soul-Spirit ) is able to control and direct it to carry out his commands. But the creature - regardless of how well it has been broken and trained - is still a wild, free-spirited Mustang at heart. Its primit ive instincts are still within it, and it will respond"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" 64 instinctively when threatened by danger, stimulated by fear or challenged for its territorial 'space' by another member of its species. Why? Because all of its instinctive reactions are controlled by that pea-sized primal-core - the Reptilian Factor - disco vered by Dr MacLean. Do you understand this?\" I asked him. \"We find this illogical,\" he responded. \"Within each and every mind there is the remem- brance of previous dimensional times. The remember ing, therefore, must know that the existence and continuation of the mind is not controlled by the body. Indeed, the body is controlled by the mind. Therefore we ask the question: Who, what, where, controls the minds of man? Who, what, where is the rider?\" He asked. \"If the 'rider' is our Soul-Spirit - and our body is the Wild Mustang - then it comes down to the degree of control it is able to exert over our physi cal body as to who is in command,\" I answered. \"All memory of our other-dimensional existence is either blanked out of our minds at the moment of birth, or shortly thereafter. And, I might tell you, it remains a blank for most of us until the moment of death and separation.\" \"Is this true of all mankind?\" Monitor asked. \"There are, possibly, many exceptions,\" I repli ed, \"but, in general, I would say yes. We really have no knowledge of either our 'after-lives', or our 'before-lives'. We are aware only of the life we are living now. To most of us, the rest remains an ' unknown ' and, as I've already told you, man inherently fears the unknown.\" \"Have you not Teachers? Have you not t hose who have shown you? Why do you not listen?\" he asked. \"But we do listen,\" I told him. \"That is, the 'intellect' listens, but our body-structure possesses that overriding fear-factor that helps physical man to survive.\" \"There have been others before who demonstrated that survival depends not on body,\" he persisted. \"You have been shown, but still you choose not to accept.\""},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" 65 \"It is not always our choice to accept that which we have been religiously trained to believe,\" I told him. \"The belief in the after-life survival of the soul-spirit often comes into conflict with the way we have been conditioned or trained to respond to t he various stresses of everyday existence. \"Pain, or the threat of pain, is sometimes used to control the physical part of our dual existence,\" I explained, \"It is used to exact a desired response when imposing 'discipline' upon a child. Some children are slapped or spanked when they are disobedient, others are shouted at or browbeaten into submission. . . \" \"Conditioned?\" Monitor interjected. \"Yes, conditioned,\" I told him. \"Conditioned to accept their place and role in society by the older and more dominant members of our families, schools or communities. Unfortunately, it is most often the grossest beings of the world - the more physically dominant, power-hungry individuals - who control the populations of this planet, using fo rce and physical pain in order to impose their will upon the masses.\" \"Therefore our appearance would cause pain and suffering amongst humanity?\" He asked. \"It may not cause pain and suffering,\" I explained, \"but it might engender fear. It would not be fear of you - or your appearance - but, rather, a fear of the 'unknown quantity' you represent.\" \"Your Governments are well aware of our presence,\" he said, sounding somewhat puzzled by what I had just told him. \"Indeed they are, but you pose an even greater threat to these Government officials as well as to the religious leaders of the world and their followers. You are a threat to all 'civilized' people on this planet because you are an 'unknown quantity'. And, as such, you represent a potential threat to the 'status quo' that most G-B ’ s feel comfortable living with. \"The one thing most Governments fear most about your presence is your advanced knowledge and technology.\" \"And why is this?\" He asked."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" 66 \"Because it could completely undermine the control they exert over their people. This is what all Gross-Beings in power fear above a ll: The loss of their power, their money and their control.\" \"Why do you not change this condition?\" \"It is not that we don ’ t have a desire to change it,\" I explained, \"It is just that we don't have the leadership, or the followers - or a strong enough collective will - to change it. Change can only come through the efforts of the teachers and leaders among us.\" \"You have leaders who dominate?\" He sounded surprised. \"You support leaders who dominate?\" I misread his question and assumed he was speaking of leaders in general, not about the L-MP ’ s who might be Leaders. I answered accordingly. \"All of our leaders dominate,\" I told him, \"It is the major part of the power-structure they control. It is how they hold onto their power, and how they are able to manipulate their police forces, spy agencies, secret service bureaus, armed forces . . .\" \"Fear?\" \"Yes, fear. They control the world through the subtle - and sometimes not so subtle - use of fear.\" \"Why do you allow this?\" \"Because collectively, people are like sheep. . .like cattle. The collective consciousness of our world is weak and wimpish,\" I explained. \"There are a small number of Like-Minds in the world who see things as you see them - and who understand that massive changes must be made - but we are in the minority.\" \"When the Earth-changes occur upon the planet Earth, they will remain to be destroyed in bodily form,\" our Monitor intoned. \"Who will remain to be destroyed?\" I asked."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" 67 \"Those who fear,\" he replied. \"This I understand.\" \"We have approached your Governments and offered our co-operation,\" he told me. \"We have approached individuals to see how best we will be accepted.

We understand that there are those among you who remember from whence they came. It is to them we make our information most readily available. But the factor of fear, in all concepts, is a great inhibitor.\" I decided to continue playing the role of The Devil's Advocate and probe as deeply as possible into all aspects of the of the Ancient Ones ’ presence here on Earth . \"You have not made clear to us exactly what your motives are in coming to Earth,\" I said. \"Your real purpose - the real reason for coming here - has not been made entirely clear. It is partly because of this that you are still considered an unknown quantity and, as I've already explained, it is the unknown-factor that mankind fears the most.\" \"We have stated our purposes to all those whom you would call your 'Governing Body',\" he replied. \"They do not choose to enlighten each individual (the general public) for reasons you have given. This we comprehend. We have stated - to many enquiring minds that are compatible with our manifestations upon the planet Earth - the purpose of our communication with those of Earth's people. ” He explained, “ Our purpose is to assist with the coming times of change and eruption upon the planet Earth,\". \"Earth is needed by Universal forces as a balancing factor. We do not wish to see the planet Earth destroyed.\" He stopped for a moment as if weighing carefully what he was about to say next."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" 68 \"We come to offer co-operation and enlightenment so that Earth's people will cease to disrupt the globe from within and without, for this greatly upsets the balance in the Universe and your own Solar System. \"We are here to aid and to help.

You must not use the information to imprison your fellow beings. The information must be readily available to all who seek it, for those who seek are awakening in their remembering.\" I explained to Monitor that I understood what he was telling us and that we would - when they let me know the timing was right - try to get the information out to all who would listen. I went on to tell him that my major concern lay in the fact that the people who run and control our governments are the last people to take heed of any of the warnings Carole and I will be passing on to the world. I added that people in government were, for the most part, the very same Gross- Beings's we had been telling him about, and explained that they were blinded to anything and everything but their own positions in a bureaucracy based on control. Monitor listened intently to all I had to say before asking the next question. \"How is it that the Gross-Beings have risen to a State of power and domination when you"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" 69 are the 'enlightened ones'?\" He asked. \"Because they seek only to accumulate material wealth and the power that can be bought with it,\" I explained. \"They do not seek refinement of the mind. By using t heir wealth and resources, they can purchase the services of those who will serve. They dominate others by instilling fear into the hearts of all who oppose them. \"How does one negate this fear?\" He asked. \"Primarily by ignoring them,\" I replied. \"By refusing to waste precious time and energy fighting or opposing them, we give them nothing tangible to focus on. We gain more by 'doing our own thing' while leaving them to fight 'shadows' on their own. This way, we are able to concentrate all of our energy towards the future.\" \"They are the main warring and destroying factions within your Earth. To allow them to continue will mean the complete destruction of the planet Earth,\" he said. \"This we readily understand,\" I told him. \"But haven't you told us already about the coming 'changes' and the ultimate 'cl eansing' of the Earth? Who is to survive this 'cleansing' process? Will it be them, or us?\" \"Those who understand that the mind is greater than the body,\" he replied, \"For the mind is fed from the Source of All Knowledge, and - should disease or catastrophe attack the body - then those who have the mind, will reach out for the answers. ” He paused briefly. “ The answers have already been given to mankind.\" What he had just been saying made a great deal of sense to me, for my mind had been receiving a flood of information over the past several weeks regarding th e coming Earth-changes. I knew that there is absolutely no way of preventing the apocalyptic events that are soon to befall our planet. But I was beginning to formulate various so lutions that might lessen the mass slaughter and damage that will inevitably occur once the Earth changes begin and our planet is in upheaval."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" 70 One of the answers is ‘ dispersalization ’ - a method of dispersing some of the world's population from in . . . and around . . . major industrialized cities and towns into smaller, more self- sufficient communities. As a possible counter to the almost total decimation of our planet's population, I was being shown groups of L-MP ’ s - spread all over the globe in small, self-sufficient, partially isolated 'sanctuaries' - being able to survive the apocalypse. However, let me make it absolutely clear , the visions I was having were not - I repeat, not - of 'Hippie-Type-Havens' or ‘ Flower-Power-Cult- Cloisters ’ of the 1960's, nor were they like the Waco or Jonestown-Like Communes whose followers met such tragic ends in the hands of their leaders. Instead, I was seeing small, simple - totally independently run - village-type communities being developed by people who had primarily been bred and raised to the magnificent isolation of country life, along with those rare city folk who are attuned to nature and the wilds. Such Like-Minded People will not miss the unnatural vibrational rhythms of city living and, for the most part, will be people who are ready, willing, and able, to husband and nurture so the y , their families , and others might survive. Such 'Sanctuaries' would be comprised of relatively small numbers of younger families who - although fully aware of what is going on in the rest of the world - will not have been 'contaminated' by , nor indoctrinated in, the philosophies or the corruption of the Gross Being's. Although categorized by today ’ s standards as being somewhat ‘ Utopian ’ and ‘ far-out ’ , such a way of life already exists in many parts of the world - and is not as far-fetched as it sounds. There are already large populations of such people liv ing in relative harmony all over the planet : Quakers, Mennonites, Hutterite, Mormon, and Amish people live within the structures of their own communities in the West - each living within t heir belief systems and life-styles, and almost totally isolated from the corruption, drugs, crime, immorality, degradation, and the violence that goes on within so many of the larger cities in our so-called ‘ civilized ’ world. The Far-East abounds in a multitude of diverse communities. From the Hunza Valley in the"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" 71 Himalayas, through to northern India, Nepal, Pakistan and Tibet. They exist, also, throughout the countryside of China, Korea, Borneo, Java, Indonesia and Celebes . . .to the many semi-isolated islands of the Mid and South Pacific . . . and beyond to the shores of South America. It is a form of communal life that has thrived since man first emerged on this planet. This form of community isolation creates a healthy state of mind. It permits people to live their own lives, and to follow their own principles and beliefs without being contaminated by the filth, pollution and moral depravity that goes on in the world around them. It offers an escape for all those young people who, surrounded by peer-pressures in drug and sex-oriented neighborhoods, are desperately looking for their own space in which to learn how to say 'no'. It is an 'alternative life- style' that gives people of all ages the opportunity to think for themselves, and to evaluate who they really are in a world that is on the verge of almost total madness. I presented this 'dispersal' concept to Monitor. \"This would not be possible at this time, for the number of humanity of which you talk greatly outnumber that which would be considered,\" he said. \"But shouldn't we warn other 'enlightened' people in high risk areas of the world of the dangers to them and their children?\" I asked. \"At least they will be able to do something to protect themselves against the dangers of the coming Earth-changes.\" \"This is correct,\" he replied \"and information is being given by many who monitor your Earth to those many who seek it.\" \"What is going to happen to the vast majority of people?\" I asked. \"Those who leave the Earth plane with an enlightened mind will, once again, come into a bodily form of a faster rate of vibration than has been before. That which you term 'reincarnation' (will happen) at a faster rate than before,\" he said. I was about to pose another question when he spoke again. \"Those who are less understanding will leave the Earth and will remain in the next level of"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" 72 dimension so that they may be attuned to changing Earth patterns and life-forms,\" he said. \"Those who have been schooled in the understanding of benevolenc e to Earth's children will remain within the Earth's atmosphere to cast light where it is needed.\" \"You are talking now of the death of millions - maybe even billions - of people,\" I told him, \"and death - as I have explained to you - is a most frightening scenario to the majority of people on Earth. Knowing that they are doomed to die pr ematurely from causes over which they have no control will cause great fear, consternation and panic.\" \"Then will you not enlighten them?\" He asked. \"We will be trying to do just that through this book,\" I informed him, \"but we need your help through the upcoming transitional period that is about to decimate our planet.\" \"How may we assist you?\" \"By helping us warn people of the real dangers that exist. Dangers from the Earth changes, from the bombardment of cosmic and solar radiation, and from everything else that is either taking place, or is about to take place. \"People must be told of these dangers. The right people must be informed so that they can take measures to protect themselves and their fa milies. They must be warned in time to isolate themselves from all potential hazards so that - when the time comes - there will remain a higher- vibrational, more enlightened, more compassionate, and far more gentle nucleus of people who will be there to form the basis of a new humane race of the future,\" I told him. \"This is where we need your help. To help those who need help in forming these vital ‘ pockets of isolation ’ - these 'sanctuary-communities' - so they may protect and foster the future generations of the new human race on this planet.\" \"It will not be possible to isolate yourselves co mpletely,\" he said. \"Therefore we offer you that you must group together all those of one understanding.\" \"I am not suggesting all Like-Minds group together,\" I told him. \"Just enough of those who"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":" 73 are willing to live in isolated pockets of safety in various parts of the world until the Earth changes are over.\" \"We understand your concern,\" Monitor told me \"However, we feel this to be a task of great monument.\" \"Indeed it will be,\" I assured him. \"The isolation will come when the Like-Minds are totally of one mind,\" he said. \"Throughout the world there will be - as you speak - 'the isolation'. There will be the gathering unto one's own of all who will remove themselves.\" \"This is exactly what I am suggesting,\" I told him. \"This is exactly what must be communi- cated to any of the Like-Minded people who will listen. It will then be up to each of them - as individuals - to take the necessary measures to im plement their own safety and survival. Each group must organize, re-locate, and develop their own isolated survival area independent of all others. But it is absolutely necessary they begi n their preparations now - not next month or next year - but now ! Their future survival will depend on it.\" If nothing else, Monitor seemed to share my concern for the immediacy of the problem and the need for positive action as soon as possible. \"We have also emphasized greatly the need for understanding - the need for information to reach all those of Like-Mind,\" he said. \"It is imperative that the information be given and made available. This, we understand, is the only way to negate the fear-factor.\" \"Yes, I agree,\" I told him. \"It may not be the only solution I can think of at this point in time.\" There was a momentary lull as Monitor appeared to mull over what I had just said. \"We have been observing,\" he said. \"We do not find other alternatives.\" \"Then there is validity to what I have just presented to you?\" I asked. \"We understand,\" he replied."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" 74 At last I was beginning to feel some small sense of relief. - * - * - * - "},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" 75 VII  ===================================================  HYPNOTIC PROGRESSIONS INTO THE FUTURE My next question concerned the future of our planet as seen through the minds of a number of volunteer subjects who had been hypnotized and 'progressed' (the opposite of regressed) forward in time into the world of the near future. \"Do you have the ability to look into our future? The future of our planet Earth?\" \"You ask us to perceive 'time change'?\" He replied. \"Yes.\" \"We are aware (of the future).\" I had asked the question because, at the time, I had both heard, read of and conducted several hypnotic sessions myself into past-life experiences of a number of people. However, I was more intrigued by other experiments in which the subjects are asked to go forward in time instead of back. Some of the results have been quite amazing and not surprisingly give us a picture of the degree of destruction the Earth-changes are about to inflict upon our planet in many dramatic ways. The vast majority of those who have been hypnotically progressed into the future return with tales of cataclysmic events and mass destruction reporting that up to 75% of the entire Earth's human population had been wiped from the face of the Earth! Among those who managed to survive the hypnotized subjects told of liv ing conditions that were appalling and frightening, with some families reduced to living in caves, shattered buildings, and in derelict shipwrecks that had been washed ashore . Others - struggling to survive in small"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" 76 communities that lay in desert or desolate areas - found they were barely able to protect them- selves from the radiation and weather conditions beneath the small, flimsy shelters they had constructed to shade themselves. Similar scenarios have been depicted by other subjects who have penetrated the barriers of time and progressed into our Earth ’ s possible future. All of them perceived devastation of horrendous proportions in which the Earth's luscious mantle of plant life had been decimated beyond recognition, and where billions of people and animal life-forms had been erased from the surface of our planet. I outlined some of the scenarios that had been witnessed by so many of these subjects to Monitor and explained that this was the future into which I wanted him to peer. I asked him to describe the worldwide desolation and destruction of human, animal and plant life after the Earth changes had passed. \"We understand you speak of bodily forms?\" He enquired. \"Yes, indeed,\" I responded. \"Your Earth is undergoing great change,\" he said. \"Therefore land will disappear, and water will appear. Where these minds have projected into the future, they have gone to familiar places upon the Earth which - at that time - will no longer be in existence,\" he told me. \"There will be a decrease in bodily forms upon the Earth, but there will also be an increase . . .\" He paused in mid- sentence. \"An increase in what?\" I asked. \"An increase in the ability to use bodily form, or discard it as necessary,\" he replied. \"A dimensional change.\" There was a fairly long pause as Monitor appeared to be either weighing carefully what he wished to say next or - as had been the case earlier - he was consulting with his associates. At last he continued."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" 77 \"Those minds that are perceiving the future, as you would term it, and who understand only bodily form, perceive the Earth's people who are c hoosing - at that time - to demonstrate bodily form,\" he said. \"Once again, the choice will be for the individual to experience.\" He again paused as if listening to other voices I could not hear. \"We will look to further explanation.\" There was another long moment before he returned. \"It will be the choice of the individual (as to) whether or not they take on bodily form.\" He said. \"Much as we have described (to you) in y our past events, (there were) individuals who could do this at will. It is not always necessary for you to be encased in the bodily structures.\" I understood what he was saying, but it was only a partial answer to my question. Bodily life-forms, to Monitor, are completely incidental to existence. One slips them on and off in much the same way one would put on, or take off, one's clothes. To The Monitors, in general, it seems that destruction of either the planet's surface or of human or animal life forms simply means ‘ change ’ . It does not mean obliteration. And the resultant trauma in the form of fear, pain, horror or any number of other feelings is no more t han a range of emotions that need to be experienced if the Soul-Spirit is to refine to the vibrational level of the next dimension. Perhaps we would all be better off if we, too, could follow - and believe in - this simple philosophy of ‘ change ’ when it comes to life, death and the impending horrors of the coming Earth changes. - * - * - * - "},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" 78 VIII  ================================  MAGNETIC POLE REVERSALS As mentioned earlier in this book, I had been receiving vast amounts of miscellaneous information quite independent of Carole's trance-channel sessions. Much of it was of a technical nature pertaining to the coming Earth changes, and a great deal of it involved the nature and properties of the various fields and forces interacting within, and without, our planet. Far-out as it may seem, this intelligence was to prove useful when Carole had an ‘ Out-of-Body Experience ’ (OBE) during one of her trance-channeling sessions wherein she found herself far out in space looking back at planet Earth. She told me she could see a 'shield' around the planet that looked something like 'Saranwrap ' enveloping a giant watermelon, and said she was being told it was protecting Earth from being 'burned up' by our Sun. This 'visualization' is a fairly accurate depiction of our magnetosphere (were it possible to actually see it) as it deflects the solar wind and plasmic material as it flows (in the form of free electrons and ions) around and beyond the Earth's magnetic shield. During this OBE, she witnessed the shield 'breaking up' and was told that it, along with our moon, would soon be destroyed. Carole - and a number of other psychically-gifted people - have the ability to see many of the invisible force-fields that surround us (such as an aura, etc.) and, when she described the field as beginning to break up, this coincided exactly with the material I had been ‘ receiving ’ regarding the Earth's magnetosphere and the physical changes that have already begun to affect our planet. For the benefit of the sceptics (who may have read this far in this book) let me assure you,"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" 79 this breakdown of our magnetosphere is no occu lt mumbo-jumbo, but a measurable - already detected phenomenon - that has taken place both within and outside our magnetosphere. Our astrophysicists, solar scientists, geophysicists and others working in various Space programs around the world, are fully aware of the not-so-subtle changes that have already taken place in the space around our planet and, most especially, within the Van Allen Radiation Belts and the Ionosphere ( ‘ plasmasphere ’ ). They are also very much aware of the effects chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are having on our ozone layer and the even greater damage that continues to be done to our fragile Van-Allen radiation belts by the electromagnetic radio transmissions that are being beamed out nonstop into the Universe from such diverse electro-magnetic devices as hydro- electric grids and generating stations. Such transmissions are doing untold harm to our magnetosphere for they knock electrons from the trapped atoms within the radiation belts and turn them into highly reactive ions. For centuries there have been predictions of calamitous Earth changes which, it was claimed, would mark the end of our world as we know it and usher in the 'New Millennium'. Yet, to the best of my knowledge, nobody has satisfacto rily explained the actual physics behind such a cataclysmic event nor come up with a valid hypotheses linking a magnetic polarity reversal with the seismic upheavals that will upset the Earth's rotational axis to the point where it will start tumbling drunkenly through space. Within the center of our planet Earth lies a molten iron core which, as our planet rotates, creates a 'dynamo effect' within the Earth. This, in turn, generates a weak electromagnetic field of fairly substantial magnitude. As most readers alr eady know, it is this magnetic field that creates our North and South magnetic poles. But, more importantly, it is this field - in the form of our Magnetosphere - that protects the Earth's biosphere and surface from lethal doses of the radiation that issues from Solar flares and Magnetic storms generated by our Sun as well as beyond our solar system in the form of cosmic radi ation that fills every corner of the universe."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" 80 This Earth-generated magnetic fi eld - our 'magnetosphere' - forms a giant 'magnetic bottle' around our planet that protects all life-forms on Earth from both the cosmic rays and highly charged particles (protons and electrons) that are carried - at speeds of around 20,000 miles per second - by the ‘ Solar wind ’ ! Packing energies of over 10,000 electron volts each, these particles would decimate the surface of our planet were they not trapped in two enormous doughnut-shaped 'bands' (called the ‘ Van Allen Radiation Belts) that encircle the globe. Within these 'bands' lie two belts - the 'inner' and 'outer' - and it is within these two belts that most of the potentially harmful and lethal Solar and cosmic radiation is both trapped - and held in place by - by the Earth ’ s magnetic field. There is, however, one other little known fact about our magnetosphere that seems to have eluded even our brightest scientists: it is the interaction between the solar wind and our magnetic field holds our planet at its present axial tilt (or inclination) in relation to the Sun! The axes of all planets in our Solar system are tilted (inclined) at certain angles in relation to their paths around the Sun. As many of you ar e aware, the axis of our Earth is inclined at approximately 23.5 degrees to the plane of its ecliptic in relation to our Sun. But what actually holds it in this position? This answer is surprisingly simple: It is held in that specific inclination by the interaction between the magnetic fields created by the Solar Winds and our Earth's own magnetic field! In essence, this interaction between the charged particles from the Sun and our Magnetosphere acts as a giant magnetic axle which - like the 'C' mounts that are used to hold small Globe- Atlases in place - it too actually holds the axis of our planet in place. If Earth's magnetic field were suddenly switched off, this magnetic-axle-mount would completely disappear allowing our planet to begin a slow, drunken tumble along its path around the sun."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" 81 If n o longer held in place at its current 23.5 degree inclination to the Sun, the unevenly distributed mass of the planet's dense crustal plates and polar ice caps would instantly throw the planet off-kilter like an unbalanced wheel on an automobile, causing it to and shudder through space until it either found some form of equilibrium around a new semi-balanced center of gravity, or its magnetic field were 'switched' back on to create a new magnetic-axle mount . How is it possible for the Earth's magnetic field to suddenly turn off? No one really knows. However, over the course of our planet ’ s multi-million year history, it seems to have occurred many times, and each time it may have been triggered by a magnetic polarity reversal . Whenever an electrically generated magnetic field reverses polarity, it must first collapse. And it is during this collapsed stage that the electro-magnetic field is completely shut down. Put simply, the magnetic field is ' switched off ' ’ during the reversal thereby causing the Earth ’ s axis to slip off its mount and begin to wobble freely in space! As you know, our planet is not a perfectly round sphere but, rather, an oblate spheroid - the distance around the equator being sli ghtly greater than the Earth's circumference around the poles. This equatorial 'bulge' is the result of the centrifugal forces generated by the spin of the planet over the course of about 700,000 years. If the current balance of this rotational axis becomes altered in any way - even slightly - the density, weight and distribution of the tectonic plates will almost certainly shift, causing gargantuan seismic stresses to come into play as c entrifugal forces and the planet's gravitational field vie with each other in a colossal tug-of-war. Over hundreds of thousands of years the mass and thickness of the crustal plates has varied greatly as continents - floating on a molten core - drifted into each other causing seismic activity and upheavals that created mountains and ocean rifts and ridges in various areas of the globe. These gradual changes have - since the last magnetic reversal some 700,000 plus years ago - shifted the balance of our planet drastically, and should the magnetic-axle-mount be removed, ALL of the crustal plates will shift dramatically as they seek to find a new center of gravity."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" 82 This shifting will cause seismic activity of a magnitude we can only guess at as the combination of centrifugal and gravitational forces place pressure on all of the tectonic plates causing them to ride and slide over each other like melting ice-floes on a mighty river. This movement of the plates will build 'instant' mountain ranges in some areas, while sinking vast areas of land beneath the oceans in others. These are the apocalyptic events John warned us about in the Book of Revelations, not the arrival of giant meteors or asteroids. Similar warnings of impending doomsday by ‘ fire and brimstone ’ have also been predicted by other seers and prophets over the centuries and although such events will not be the end of the planet, it will certainly be the end of the world as we know it. Within the Earth's total life-span there have been many magnetic polarity reversals in which the Magnetic North Pole and the Magnetic South Pole have switched places. We know this because each time it occurred in the past, it left an indelible record of the changes imprinted within igneous rocks and within the sedimentary layers of the planet. We know from these records that such 'c omplete' reversals occurred approximately every 200,000 years - or they did, that is, up until about 600,000 to 720,000 years ago. Since then, the geological records show the magnetic poles stopped doing complete 'flip-flops' (total polarity reversals) and switched to partial shifts which, luckily for our primitive ancestors, were a lot less destructive to the globe. We also know from the many samples taken from surface rocks and core specimens that have been retrieved from the beds of our oceans , that our magnetic North Pole has wandered considerably over the face of the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions before it reached its current location on Bathurst Island. However, there is little indication that these wanderings had any significant bearing on either axial tilt or climatic changes. Why this is so, we don't know, but we do know we"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" 83 are long overdue for a polarity reversal within the next few years. There are many unknown factors associated with a complete polarity reversal and so far I have had great difficulty in assessing the potential for disasters that will befall this planet during the next Earth changes. A few of the unknowns are as follows:- 1. How long will it take for the process of a complete polarity reversal to take place? 2. How long will the Earth's magnetic field be shut down? Will it be for a split second. . . a minute. . . an hour. . . a day. . . a year or longer? 3. How long will it take before the Earth re-aligns its rotational axis and re-establishes a new elliptic plane? 4. When will the seismic activity settle back to a relatively normal balance? 5. What will happen to the Van Allen Radiation Belts once the magnetosphere 'releases' the trapped particle matter? Will the Belts return to help shield the planet when the reversal is complete? 6. Just how harmful or lethal will the Solar and cosmic radiation be to life-forms on Earth? We are, to a limited degree, aware of the mass-extinctions of animal and plant species that have taken place in the past and, as of now, there are many diverse theories concerning the extinction of the Dinosaurs and other life forms upon the planet. These range from the heating of the planet to the cooling of the planet, to the ‘ greenhouse effect ’ caused by volcanic dust, giant meteor collisions, etcetera. All of them are theories various scientists have expounded over the years yet so far I have yet to read of anyone who m entions the possibility that ancient life forms may have been wiped out as the result of Cosmic and Solar radiation due to a major polarity reversal! And this is odd in light of biblical prophesies that claim the end of world will come as a result of “ Fire that will rain down from the Heavens ” !"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" 84 However long the actual period of vulnerability may be (i.e. the length of time the Earth's magnetic field is actually shut down), it is obv ious from fossil evidence that some species are better able to survive than others. But how well did mankind do during the last major flip? Where, for example, did the human population shelter from the radiation? Was it in caves? And, if that was so, was it such an event that turned early man into a cave-dweller in the first place? Was he safer outside his shelter at night when the harmful radiation from the Sun was least powerful, or were there other factors that determined the extent of his immunity? What was there within the physical make up of different creatures (animals, fish, insects, man, and the rest) that enabled one species to withstand levels of radiation that would irreparably harm or kill other species? We have a few of the answers to these riddles, but we still have a long way to go to find the full and actual truth. It is essential that we learn as much as possible about the effects of radiation on all life forms as soon as possible so that we may be bette r prepared for what is to come. We need to know the best methods of protection against a cosmic-radiation onslaught of the magnitude that is coming, and be able to utilize the expertise and knowledge presently being gained by NASA and other Space Agencies in their study of our magnetosphere and the space around us. How long is too long when it comes to exposure? Will the roofs of our houses afford protection, and if not, how much time will we have to get to the nearest shelter before it is too late? Are there any materials available that will help protect people outdoors from the radiation? What will happen to household pets, farm livestock, field crops, wildlife, sea-life, and all the other living creatures? How mobile will man be during this 'switched-off' ’ period?

It should be stressed, however, that although the potential for disaster through cosmic and solar radiation is real, in all probability it will be the seismic activity and aftermath generated by the tumbling of our axis-free planet that will cause the greatest amount of damage and losses to mankind and our domesticated livestock. Although this subject will be covered in greater detail towards the end of this book, let it suffice to say at this time, that all low-lying coastal areas will be the most vulnerable to the effects of tidal wave inundation following the almighty collisions between the tectonic plates. No coastal areas will be safe from the oceans of the world for hundreds of miles inland once the Earth - free from its axles - begins its slow tumble through space. Last, but by no means least, comes the burning question. Who will survive these catastrophic events and go on to that sweeter, happier, more gentle land we call tomorrow?

I believe , Monitor confirms , and then - and only then - do I feel safe in proceeding with whatever is developing in my mind.

Thus do we differentiate between the tw o,\" he said. \"However, like-mind is to like-mind, as like-mind is to like-mind.

He had told me that some of these Alien-beings seek either to dominate us or to retard the progress of all Earth people. I asked him if these aliens were actually living and working among us as ordinary, common-or-garden individuals or if, perhaps, they were among the Gross-Beings of the world. \"They are among you,\" he replied, \"and would appear , in body-form structure, similar to you. However, in mind and spiritual concept, you would find them lacking in the demonstration of that spiritual concept you call 'conscience'. They are awar e, as you are aware, of their origin. They do not seek refinement or progression.\" His voice petered out and he paused for a long moment before going on. \"These also are fed in mind from a negative that is within the Universe. However, due largely to a positive field we place around Earth, their communication - hence vibration - can be overridden. \"When we caution you. . . indeed, when we plead with you to cease the destruction of your atmosphere, it is because through the atmosphere comes the vibration of all. And, when you pierce the atmosphere (as you have done in the ozone layers) you create greater gateways for an influx of the negative. There must always be those who receive and those who send.\" After this brief digression, he returned to answer my question."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" 89 \"Yes,\" he continued, \"they are among you, thos e who have taken bodily form, but they come from other worlds. That which you know as your Moon was once inhabited with beings not dissimilar to yourselves, but in grosser form. . . grosser body structure. . . grosser mind, and whose spiritual development and enlightenment was not yet recognizable.\" Regardless of how farfetched and far removed this may be from our current understanding and perception of our Moon, neither I nor any other living person have any real knowledge as to whether or not our Moon, Mars or any other planet, has at any time in the distant past hosted life forms. I reminded Monitor that during the last session he had referred to a life-structure that once was upon the Moon and also upon the Planet that accompanied it. I asked him to explain it in greater detail. \"There was another that was completely destroyed,\" he said. \"Your Ancient ones have memory of this and have passed. . . \" \"Another what?\" I asked. \"Another planet?\" \"This was another moon,\" he replied. \"And, in proximity to the Earth, where did it lie?\" \"This would have been one quarter again closer to your Earth measurements than your Moon.\" \"Could you give us a comparison of its size in relation to the Earth?\" He appeared to think about this for a moment before answering. \"To the Earth, it was half again as dense in structure.\" \"You are saying that it was one-and-a-half times more dense than Earth?\" \"This is correct,\" he assured me. \"That would have given it a very powerful gravitational field, would it not?\" I asked. \"It was.\" \"Then what was its orbit in relation to both the Moon and Earth? Did it orbit just around the"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" 90 Earth, or around both the Earth and the Moon?\" \"It was almost stationary due to its density. However, there was slow movement.\" \"You have said that this planet was destr oyed. How was it destroyed and what happened to the debris?\" \"Much of the debris entered y our Earth's atmosphere and much of the debris is still covering your Moon,\" he replied. \"Much debris was filtered - refined - as it came closer to the Earth. . . rendering it harmless. However, there was substance that clouded your Earth for many of your Earth years. You would call this gases or radiation.\" He stopped and appeared to reconsider the statement. \"You would call this storms. . . cloud and vapour.\" I felt compelled to let Monitor know that this was wildly out of line and totally contrary to established theory. \"You realize that what you are saying goes against everything we know about our moon, our solar system. . . and all planets with strong gravitational fields?\" Monitor had, from the research I had done based on statements made in the past, always been right. I was at a loss to understand how he could make such outlandish claims about enormous moons or satellites (with their attendant gravitational fields) spinning around each other in such limited space. It just didn't make sense. Then, as if out of the blue, a thought suddenly occurred to me: Was he, perhaps, talking about it being in another dimension other than the Third? \"Was this planet within our dimension?\" I asked. \"Was it part of this dimension in which we exist?\" Monitor was almost beside himself in his response. \"Indeed it was! And you must realize that even unto this time, this date. . . today. . . today. . . the time today - make note of it (approximately 3:45pm on July 22 nd , 1989) - your scientists will discover that they have incorrectly correlated many things.

He continued. \"However, we ask you - as you have queried this - to be patient and understand that were your mind not ready to accept them, you would not have come to the asking. Your science and, your government bodies, continue to mislead you.\" I told him I appreciated his understanding my position and added that, regrettably, most of my knowledge was gleaned only through reading the re search and findings of others. His response was succinct and to the point. \"Do not your facts constantly contradict themselves as your time progresses?\" \"Yes, to a certain degree they do.\" \"We would ask you to think of the planet of which you speak in terms of holding open a dimensional gate. This you will think upon, and further information will be revealed within your mind so that you will understand and can a ccept the concept. Indeed, remnants of the planet of which we speak are uncovered in your earth even now, as we converse here.\" I queried him about the remnants. \"Are you, perhaps, talking about re mnants of meteors and meteorites being uncovered?\" I asked. \"We are talking about substances for which your scientists are perplexed and offer only theory. And so it remains only theory just as does your theory of relativity.\" \"During a previous session you mentioned something about the collapse of the balance structures between this 'sister' planet, the Earth and the Moon. And, at the time, you said, 'Those who waited, still trapped in Third dimensional life-form s, waiting for the dimensions to re-align so"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":" 92 they might return from whence they came.' “ You went on to say that, 'When it was seen that the thread of energy of the Source from whence they had come was weakening, they tried to take upon themselves Third dimensional life but, though they tried many times, they failed to do so. ’ Would you elaborate on what you meant by the 'Source'?\" I asked. \"This would be other planetary systems,\" he said. \"Can you be more specific?\" \"There would be those who came - as we have come - from the Pleiades. There are also those who would have come from other star systems that are known. . . and others that are still - as of this moment - unknown to you, therefore we cannot identify them specifically by an understanding of name for you have yet to discover their existence.\" Although, at the time, I failed to ask him what he meant by this, I seemed to intuitively know he was talking about planetary systems that exist in other dimensions far removed from our present state of knowledge. He continued. \"However, we will offer you also that the Orion - those which are not as evolved - were also among early Earth people at that time. When we ta lk of their being trapped in the Third dimensional force, you must understand the trauma which the intelligence went through, therefore the need to express itself was great. We have given information earlier on the subject.\" I recalled what he was telling me but I was anxious to gain more knowledge about those early Star People who had landed here on Earth. \"There lies, in Indonesia, an island known a Celebes where, it is said, your direct descendants still exist, ” I told him. “ These people recall in their legends the time when the first Pleiadians arrived in their Spaceships many millennia ago. Are you familiar with these people?\" \"We wonder at your emphasis upon the (word) relative,\" he said. \"We wonder why you emphasise 'your' instead of 'our'. Do you consi der yourself apart, still? Yes, we are aware, and"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" 93 become aware of all those to which there is a possible link. We will again explain for your understanding. \"When the mind has been purified - when the mind has been freed of its density - it produces a pattern which our craft are designed to locate and communicate with. That mind-pattern you can liken, if you will, to your ancient forms of 'radar'. When the mind is lifted, and the vibration made higher, there is an energy field which can be traced upon a monitor we have within our craft. Therefore, we can draw near by technical terms to that mind. Hence we are able to find your mind in many locations. Once we have the patterns we merely draw closer. \"We heard - many times - your desire for our communication in a form which you could not, nor would not, deny. Therefore we realised that if further communication were to be harmonious with the mind we would show ourselves as best we were able to you. Thus you were not 'chosen'. . . but you were in communication (with us) and your message was received.\" I thanked him for his response but was now anxious to get more information about the people of Celebes who claim to be the direct descendants of the Ancient Ones from the Pleiades. I had recently seen a remarkable TV documentary film series, 'The Ring of Fire', that had been produced by two adventurous English brothers, Lorne and Lawrence Blair, in which they had included pictures of these ‘ Pleiadian descendants ’ . In the footage, we saw the rather unique style of architecture of the dwellings which, they claim, simulate the design of the original Pleiadian spaceships. I now raised another point he had mentioned. \"A short while ago, you referred to a 'thread of energy' that ties other planetary visitors to their original Source. Is this in any way similar to the 'Silver Cord' so often described in OBE's (Out of Body Experiences)?\" \"This, indeed, is similar in structure. However, this is the cord which operates - or allows the ‘ etheric ’ body to operate - within the body. You might call it, in your understanding, a 'converter of energy', for full energy passed through the bodily form could never manifest. Indeed, you have"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" 94 witnessed and understood those whose energy fields have heightened to an extent that the body disintegrated before witnesses.\" I presumed he was referring to a form of ' human spontaneous combustion ‘ - a highly controversial subject occasionally reported in the Tabloids - wherein a human body will for no apparent reason - burst into flames and burn from the inside out. I didn't question this and he continued. \"We would ask for a moment to explain further the different craft (UFO ’ s) for we feel you have a need to understand. There are also the craft which are manned by the 'Robots' which have been observed by those (who are) seeking (he was referring to my UFO sighting in the Turks and Caicos Islands). These are manned, in your understanding, by half- mechanical half-organic 'Robots'. There are others who use this shape of craft also who have been monitoring Earth's people. These craft - and our craft - are not suitable for vast travel, therefore we have, as stated earlier through this mind, that which you would recognize as a 'Mother-Craft' that is unable to be perceived by those upon the Earth plane. However, as in a distant communication to you, we demonstrated that each time the Mother Ship came close to the Earth (or close in your understanding) how greatly it disrupted even your weather patterns!\" \"Does this ‘ Mother Ship ’ have shape and form in the Third dimension?\" I asked. \"Yes. It would liken itself to the elongated dome. . . but of vast dimensions,\" he replied. Earlier, I had asked him about the 'aliens' from other worlds who had become trapped when the gates had closed and had to manifest in life forms upon this planet. I wanted to pursue this a little further. \"When you said that these people, the Pleiadians, were trapped in Third dimensional life forms, did you mean in Earth-forms, such as hom o erectus - I mean primitive man-creatures who evolved into homo sapiens? - or are you talki ng about some other form of early Earthly animal life?\""},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":" 95 \"We speak of all animal, vegetable and, indeed, mineral (forms). We would explain further. \"When an intelligence is subjected to trauma, it is much like your perception of dropping a pebble into water and watching the pattern flow (ripple outwards) as it is made,\" he explained. \"At that time (of the gates closing) the intelligence rose and scattered itself (into the ether). Therefore, once divided, it could no longer manifest perfectly, as there was a malfunction of the energy. “ We have, earlier this day, asked of you to study the fact that, in all there is energy, energy that can take many forms. If you understand the Un iversal term 'energy' (vibration), then you have an understanding of life (all life), not just the narrow view of Earth life.\" \"Is there an 'intelligence' in energy? In all forms of energy?\" I asked. \"There is a form of intelligence. . . whether it be greater or lesser,\" he replied. \"Are you, yourselves, the original voyagers fr om the Pleiades, or are you the children of the children - of the children - of the original entities?\" \"We are in confusion as to the information you seek,\" he replied. I was thinking, at that moment, there might be a lineal connection between the original space travellers and those with whom I was now conversing. \"We, ourselves,\" I explained, \"have many ancestors. I ’ m asking if you - in your present form - are the original entities who came from the Pleiades, or whether you are the descendants of the original travellers? Is there a continui ty of existence in your life forms?\" \"Do you seek as to whether there is a cessation of a certain vibration, much like reincarnation patterns?\" \"Yes, indeed. That is exactly what I'm getting at.\" \"We understand, and we would tell you, that yes, there is change. However, the consistency of a pattern-form we will call 'body-form' is much more advanced than in Earth time and measurement. Time - in this vibration - you would measure thus: An age of five hundred (500) of your Earth years. Therefore this form is coming to a maturity.\""},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":" 96 \"That is similar to our earlier reported ancestors,\" I told him, \"human beings who, we have been told, lived for five, six, seven, or even over nine hundred years or more.\" \"Indeed, you were then still able to sustain a link with the Source when - and depending on the Soul's inclination - the maturity of the Pleiadian would be - in your Earth years - likened to one five zero, zero (1,500) to two zero, zero (2,000) years old. \"Of our years? \" I asked, dubiously. \"Indeed,\" he replied. Whether or not I can accept this explanation, is a moot point. I believed then - and I still believe today - that the incredible number of year s attributed to many of these ancient biblical figures was simply an error in translation. If you were to transpose the word ' years ' to read ' months' (i.e.'moons' as it probably was back then), and re-calculate the purported ages of these ancient people by dividing each by twelve (i.e the number of 'moons' in a year), we find that all of these so- called multi-centenarians probably lived relatively normal life-spans by today ’ s standards. If we apply this standard to Methuselah, for example - who purportedly lived to be 969 years old - he would, in fact, have been only a normal eighty years and nine months old when he died. Other biblical so-called multi-centenarians, such as Methuselah's grandson, Noah (the ark-builder and sailor-supreme during the time of the Great Fl ood) was reputed to have lived to the ripe old age of 950 years. Yet, if re-calculated by the in 1 year = 12 months scale, he would have lived to be a mere seventy nine years and two months before he died, a far more logical time period. It is quite incredible the way pure fallacy can become a hard ‘ fact ’ when tales are handed down by word-of-mouth. When later, they are transcribed into the written word, they become 'gospel'.

As we entered this session, I was now sure I knew the 'mechanics' behind the ‘ soul-spirits ’ entrapment on this planet. I had discovered how we had become trapped and why we had been compelled to reincarnate over and over in bodily form. Most importantly, though, I was now certain I knew when - and how - our soul-spirits would be free to leave this Earthly prison and either return from whence we had come. . . or go on to wherever we may choose to go. Our Monitor was ready for us as soon as the session began. He informed us that he was in harmony with us, but added that there were other 'energies' scattered around us - 'energies' within the field he was using for communication. \"Are they sympathetic entities?\" I asked. \"They are seeking to assist your enquiries,\" he replied. \"In which area or field do they wish to assist us?\" \"In your enquiring as to 'propulsion', to 'fields', to 'magnetics',\" he replied. This was more than I could have hoped for, especially as I had wanted to explore the field of electro-magnetics and, most specifically, the Earth's magnetic field. I fired my first question. \"In our last session, a piece of information you gave me pertained to the 'bands' or 'belts' surrounding our planet. My question is this; What sort of 'belts' or 'bands' were you referring to? Are these the Van Allen Radiation Belts around the Earth, or the magnetic field?\" I asked. \"It is the magnetic field around your Earth,\" he replied.\"There is, as you would term it, a"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":" 99 'molten' field that is unperceived as yet by your instruments.\" 1 \"A 'molten' field?\" I asked, somewhat puzzled by the terminology. \"This would be a term for it that you would understand, for it is a structured field,\" he replied. \"You will investigate, as we have asked you, these word-terms.\" \"Molten, in my lexicon, means something that has been melted down',\" I explained. \"This is most often accomplished by the application of heat - sometimes very high heat.\" \"This is correct.\" \"Is this a 'physical' field you are talking about?\" I asked. \"It is a physical field,\" he replied. \"In other words, a molecular structure?\" \"It is a type of molecular structure.\" \"Does it lie beyond our eco- spheric boundaries - the gaseous envelope around our planet?\" \"It is the first of the fields.\" I wondered if he was talking about the ’ plasmasphere ’ , the first layer outside of our ionosphere that is partially trapped within the two Van Allen Radiation Belts. However, I wasn't too sure that this could be termed 'a field'. I told him that I didn't know much about the subject but would investigate further. I then concentrated on the next question. \"You made mention, during a previous session, of a planet that was supposed to have existed multi-years ago. You called it a sister or companion planet to our Earth. You also said, at the time, that you would tell me when it had existed, and when it was either destroyed or disintegrated.\" \"We have investigated further,\" he replied. \"We find we are looking at 500 million of your Earth years ago. It was when life - in the form that existed upon that planet - began to 'die', in your  1 Monitor was possibly referring to the plasmasphere, a fourth state of matter that encircles our planet within the boundaries of Earth’s Magnetosphere, conducts electricity and can be affected by magnetic fields. "},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":" 100 terms.\" He paused. \"Therefore there had to be a migration of that 'life-form' into the Universe. And the 'Universe' of choice was that in which planet Earth now resides,\" he said. \"The last known viewing as the planet (was) finally destroyed, was - in your Earth years - (about) five to seven hundred million years ago. This destruction of the planet was, in your understanding, slow and arduous.\" His estimate would place it somewhere between the Paleozoic and Sinian Eras - possibly at the latter end of the Cambrian period - a time when over 90% of all living matter on Earth became extinct. \"You asked me to think of that planet as holding open a dimensional ‘ Gate ’ . You also told me that information about this happening would be given,\" I reminded him. \"Would you tell me when this dimensional ‘ gate ’ will be opening. . . why it will be opening. . . and into which dimension it will open?\" \"We have spoken previously of changes that are about to take place upon the Earth's surface. Every 20,000 years, the Earth has gone through changes,\" he said. \"What sort of ‘ changes ’ do you mean exactly? Ice Ages? Axis-Shifts? Magnetic pole- reversals?\" \"We speak of polarity changes,\" he said. \"We also understand of the rising and falling of land and offer you that there will be such change within the years two zero . You will understand this when applied to that which you are aware of being a measuring rule.\" I understood this to mean within a twenty year period - i.e. between the years 1989 to 2009. However, as Monitor sometimes starts to give a number and then breaks off in mid-sentence, it is possible he may well have been starting to say \". . . within the year two, zero, zero, zero. . . \" meaning the year 2,000. I let it pass and continued with my next question regarding the coming Earth changes. \"Do the Earth changes have anything to do with our Sun?\" I asked, then went on to say."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":" 101 \"What I am asking you is whether or not the changes that take place periodically within the Sun have any bearing on the coming changes here on Earth?\" I was referring to such periodic solar changes as the Sunspot cycles that occur approxi- mately every eleven years, as well as the solar flare activity and the Sun's magnetic field polarity reversals which occur about every 22 years. During these changes, the solar flare and magnetic storm activities cause violent bursts of electromagnetic radiation and particle emissions that bombard - and bend considerably - our magnetic shield. Monitor answered my question. \"This also affects planet Earth,\" he replied. \"However, we have previously stated that another planet has entered your solar system but as yet it has not been identified. However, your scientists and astronomers are aware of this planet,\" he stated. Using Carole's lexicon, Monitor will occasionally use 'planet' for any heavenly body, and a comet, asteroid or any other large body might well be described in the same terms. He continued. \"It approaches Earth with great rapidity. This will be both of benefit to Earth and also it will have a negative form upon the Earth. Once all ar e in alignment, the dimensional gates will be cleared and you - and all those of Like-Mind - will travel once again from one dimension to the next - from the Third, to Fourth, to Fifth - if you wish to measure in these terms. However, we would say that to take the physical into the non-physical - [that is in) your time - as you on Earth calculate it - it will cease to exist.\" \"Could you give me some idea - by comparing it to Earth - of the mass or density of this new planet you say has entered our solar-system?\" \"The size and structure is not unlike that of planet Earth,\" he replied. \"However, it contains within its nucleus that which would be of greater density than Earth.\" \"So it would be about the same size as Earth, only a lot heavier. Is this correct?\" \"This, in your understanding, is correct. However, at the time of alignment, it will lose that which you term 'heavy', for it will have a 'repelling' force-field of its own. Therefore 'density', as you"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":" 102 would term it, is not relative.\" Frankly, I don't know what to make of this unless he means it possesses an opposite (i.e repelling) magnetic field. It is only quite recently that our astronomers have detected the planetary magnetic fields within our own solar-system and even as I was writing this Voyager 2 had sent back the first report that Neptune also has a magnetic field of its own adding one more to the list which now includes Earth, Mercury, Saturn, Jupiter, Uranus and now Neptune. Surprisingly, neither Mars nor Venus - (the Earth's 'sister' planets in many ways) - have appreciable magnetospheres although, theoretically, both should have. Venus, for example, exhibits a very faint field due in part to the speed of its retro-rotational direction (i.e. the reverse to all other planets). It is possible that, in the very distant past, Venus may also have rotated in the same direction as the rest of the planets in our solar-system but, due to a possible collision with another large planet (possibly the 'sister' - or ‘ Twin-Planet ’ to Earth we had been told about in “ The Skull Speaks ” ) it was thrown out of its original orbit and knocked upside down into a reverse spin? This would have automatically shut down any internal 'dynamo-effect' generator and cu t off its magneto-spheric shield. This lack of shielding - in combination with a now closer proximity to the sun - could account for a loss of any atmosphere and the ultimate demise of all life-forms due to a lack of shielding against cosmic radiation, the solar wind, radiation and the magnetic flare activity that would have turned its atmosphere into the dense, sulphurous carbon-dioxide soup that exists today. Mars is also devoid of a magnetosphere although I believe (and this belief is also shared by many scientists) that it may well have had one similar to our own in the distant past. All of this is, of course, mere conjecture, but it should be remembered that - at present - there is no way of proving or disproving whether either Mars or Venus were ever inhabited by intelligent (or otherwise) life-forms - or that they have always been in the same orbits they are in"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":" 103 today. Further, we have little evidence (other than the asteroid belt) as to whether or not other moons or planets ever existed in our solar-system in times gone by. But what exactly do we mean when we speak of 'intelligent' life-forms? I asked Monitor. \"We ask you to define 'intelligence'\" he replied. \"An ability to think, rationalize and direct oneself independently of others,\" I responded, hoping my definition would not be too far off the mark. \"For example, does a virus such as the AIDS virus have 'intelligence?\" \"It has an intelligence inasmuch as it seeks to expand itself and be dominant,\" he said. \"Does 'energy' have intelligence?' I asked. \"It is the same.\" He replied. \"Would you elaborate, please?\" \"You are talking of one and the same,\" he said. \"Each seeks dominance.\" \"So you're saying that each force or field has its own form of 'intelligence' - whether it be gravity, nuclear, electromagnetic, vibrational or anything else that generates energy. Is this correct?\" \"Given in this context, it is correct,\" he replied. \"So, by combining all of these 'intelligences', we are creating - or rather , they are creating - atomic structures, elements, amoeba and so on? Each particle of force or charge has its own intelligence with which it can 'dominate' (or exert influence over), or direct, or control, or combine with anything the Universal Rule of Freewill allows it to. Is this correct?\" Monitor acknowledged that this was so. I next asked him if , when they first seeded this planet Earth , the first 'beings' were those who 'manifested' themselves into physical being from their own ethereal bodies, or whether they genetically manipulated or 'engineered' new life-forms from those which already existed here? \"It was a manifestation of an etheric, as you know it,\" he replied. \"However, the etheric is"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":" 104 only the etheric when looked at through the eyes of the Third dimension, or through the eyes of the critical intellect. For the ether, when the vibration is changed, is also a reality.\" \"Let me see if I have this right,\" I said. \"You first manifested in body-structure here on Earth, then when you had established your own manife sted bodies, you began seeding the lower forms of hominid (i.e. Homo erectus) so that, in cross-breeding with these Earth-forms, you would then create an Earth-form into which your soul-spirits could later incarnate. Is this correct?\" \"This is not quite accurate,\" he replied. \"You are talking of those who were trapped within the Earth.\" \"Were those who had been trapped within the Earth's density, ‘ manifestations ’ , or were they genetically 'manufactured' by you?\" \"Manifestations,\" he assured me. \"They were - and are - such as we. Only the vibration, being higher and faster, makes the body structure appear ‘ etheric ’ . \"When it was either necessary, or by choice, the vibration was slowed to become that which you would term, solidified, or that which you perceive now,\" he explained. \"This was a matter of choice for it was the easiest 'vehicle' (in which) to experience the Earth dimension.\" He paused before continuing. \"When the dimensional gates closed, there were those who were trapped. They needed to experience and express themselves in a physical form to allow the soul to become free again, otherwise they would remain trapped. This soul, mind and the personality, are parts of the same.\" \"Are there any pure-blooded descendants of these original etheric manifestations still on Earth?\" \"You ask if there are now, upon the Earth, those who came directly from the Pleiades to be, as you would term it, 'born' upon the Earth?\" \"Not exactly,\" I replied, \"I'm asking if there are any direct descendants (still on Earth) whose ancestors never interbred with the Earth people?\""},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":" 105 \"You must understand that with every incarnation, there is a purifying process,\" he explained. \"Therefore you are becoming more and more as you were.\" \"I realize that this is so, but in previous sessions we talked of the primal-core - the Reptilian Brain - that exists in every creature (all vertebrates) including man. It is only as we become more and more refined and become the ‘ bronco-buster ’ gradually taming and controlling the wild mustang, that we overcome the instinctual response mechanism of the primal-core and continue our climb to ultimate refinement. My question is this: Did the first manifestations of the Pleiadian Man have within them this primal-core?\" \"We do not have such within our structure,\" he replied. \"This belongs to the brain. . . it is not of the mind.\" \"I understand this,' I responded, a tad impatiently, \"but you are here, using Earth body- structures as host 'vehicles' for the soul-spirits, are you not?\" \"We do not seek dominance. Those who come are those who have been before,\" he answered. \"They seek permission from the host vehicles. It is not done without their consent. It is also for the safety of the host vehicle - and the safety of mankind - that the memory factor is either blocked or distorted.\" \"I'm confused,\" I told him. \"Then how may we assist you?\" \"According to our anthropologists, all of mankind on this planet is descended - via the evolutionary process - from a hominid creature we call an Ape. It goes as follows: Initially as an ape. . . then to Homo erectus. . . and finally to Homo (sapiens) sapiens. . . \" \"This is incorrect,\" Monitor cut in firmly. \"But weren't Homo (sapiens) sapiens seeded by the Pleiadians?\" \"Intelligent man is not that of the ape,\" he insisted. \"Pleiadian man is not that of the ape.\" \"But Pleiadian man has crossbred, and inter-bred, with that which was of the ape,\" I"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":" 106 pushed. \"He genetically seeded Homo erectus which had, in turn, evolved from the ape.\" \"This is an incorrect theory,\" he replied. \"You must look at the term 'quantum leap' to understand better.\" \"A 'quantum leap' is where something jumps from one stage of development to another without going through interim stages,\" I said. \"I assu med that Homo erectus had, in fact, taken such a quantum leap in its evolvement to Homo (sapiens) sapiens through genetic seeding by the Pleiadians, and then slowly evolved, through the process of cross-breeding and inter-breeding, to become the modern man we know today. Is this, or is it not, correct?\" \"This is correct if you understand that those which you term 'man of today' remained dormant within the genes until that which bore the life-force - the structure of man - had refined itself to the point where the mind was able to accept and overcome that which you call 'Animal Instinct',\" he said, referring, of course, to the primal-core or R-complex. He continued. \"This is why we constantly search within the mind, for the mind has the ability to overcome all bodily-brain- structures.\" We now know, of course, that what Monitor had just said about the mind overcoming all bodily-brain-structures is slowly being revealed by 'modern' science. We can control many of our normal automatic body functions (breathing, blood pressure, heart rate, etc.) through simple 'mind over matter' exercises that have been long k nown and understood by the teachers of yoga and other spiritual healers. An d now, today, we are witnessing other truly remarkable recoveries from both physical and mental debilities within the hallow ed halls of 'modern medicine' as our scientists begin to re-discover things many of the ancient teachers already knew, and now - at long, long last - some of our modern medical practitioners are re-awakening to a truth that never really left them . . . to a knowledge that has always been theirs to share .- * - * - * -"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":" 107 XI  =============================================  PETS, PLEIADES AND UFO TECHNOLOGY Although I had previously touched on the subject of animals, I was about to touch upon it once more. Domestic pets play a large role in the lives of a great many people, often fulfilling a very real need for companionship, affection and reciprocal love in a totally unselfish way. I explained this as best I could to Monitor, then asked him what happens to the souls of these beautiful creatures after their Earthly lives are th rough. Do they, I asked him, re-join with the Souls of their human companions in other dimensions or other ‘ lives ’ . \"It is part and parcel of the same,\" he replied. \"You and the pet are as one.\" \"You are saying that our pets are an extension of ourselves? Is this correct?\" \"This is correct.\" \"Are they an extension of our physical vibrational pattern, or of the pattern of our soul- spirits?\" \"The very highest form! ” he replied. \"However you must understand that that which you term 'pet', was also a life-form seeking to express itself upon the Earth.\" \"That is very interesting. Would you elaborate.\" \"There are many life forms within the Un iverse, and many use the planet Earth,\" he explained. \"At the time of the 'closure' they, also, were trapped. However, there were those that were, in essence, compatible, yet not strong enough to manifest as complete forms, therefore they used, as you would term it, the energies or soul -vibrations of that which is known as Man.\""},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":" 108 \"So, what you are saying is that some of these other life-forms within the Universe are totally compatible with Pleiadian life-forms. Is this correct?\" I asked. \"That is correct,\" he replied. His answers made sense to me. There is an extraordinary amount of 'love-energy' shared between 'owners' and their charges during the life-span of a pet. Far too much for me to believe that it simply evaporates into empty space when either one passes on to another plane. They become as much a part of you, as you become a part of them, and it is comforting to learn that sharing is what life is all about. . . a mutual inter-twining of spirit that combines love, shared energy, and soul. I moved on to another subject. \"I would like to return to the subject of genealogy for a moment,\" I told Monitor. \"We have talked of and about the many races on Earth as having been genetically seeded by various 'races' of Star People. Am I right?\" \"This is correct,\" he replied. \"Can you give me some idea of just where on Earth these different racial groups originated, and where they migrated to after their development?\" \"There are those who came to Earth from other Universes,\" he replied. \"The closest one to the Pleiadian source is the Dial. They also manifested upon Earth.\" \"Would you give me that name again, please.\" \"In Earth words: Dial. . . D-I-A-L. Theirs is the Universe of Troka: T-R-O-K-A.\" Monitor (through Carole) spelled both names for me. \"And in which Galaxy would that be?\" I asked. \"This is the intermediary of the Pleiadian and Dial,\" he replied. He went on to elaborate. \"We would, once again, remind you of the frantic trauma of the consciousness that needed"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":" 109 to express itself during the time of closure. (Thi s) led to mutations - due to haste - of life-forms upon the Earth,\" he explained. \"The following may help you in understanding: \"Think of a conscious- ness, in a state of hysteria, reaching out and trying to dominate that which it came into contact with - be it animal, vegetable or mineral,\" he said. \"There were those who could not understand, what you would term, a 'calamity', therefore they coul d not be reached or be saved in any way, shape, or form. They felt abandoned and al one, and needed to manifest at any cost in an effort to be released from Earth.\" \"These various racial groups,\" I began, \"those who had their origin on our planet were reasonably advanced, technologically speaking, by the time they began to migrate from one area to another. Obviously they met other racial groups wi th whom they inter-mixed, inter-married, inter- bred, and in the process, began forming the so-called 'civilized' world. Would you elaborate on this inter-breeding process and what it had to do with the soul-spirits of each race?\" \"It was merely an experience for the soul-spirit. Each life-form in the Galaxy will seek its own. It is one atom of fire with which it can resonate,\" he explained. \"No matter how it has inter- bred, the Pleiadian is still a Pleiadian.\" \"Wouldn't there be an inner conflict in some cases?\" I asked. \"This does not happen,\" he replied. \"Is there continuity in the process of re-incarnation?\" \"Indeed, there is.\" \"Would you expand on this.\" \"The Pleiadian is still as the Pleiadian, although we would like to think that his progression is somewhat faster in its purification and, therefore, the ability to return to his original source faster. \"We would also like to think that, even though it may be trapped within the human body structure, and - had your scientists taken and experimented with a Pleiadian consciousness - they would not have discovered that which you term the 'Animal Factor'.\" He was, of course, referring to"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":" 110 the 'primal-core' or the Reptilian Factor. \"But, as I explained to you before, this primal -core is part and parcel of the animal survival process on this planet,\" I explained. \"The experimentation done was very limited. We would wonder why it is accepted as a complete reality.\" \"Regrettably,\" I replied, \"because it exists. It is there, in all of us, that's why.\" \"We have demonstrated that, within this mind, we do not find the fears expressed as you have expressed them,\" he responded, again referring to Carole's mind. \"And we do not find this mind 'unique', as you would term it. There are many who do not fear this progression, this change you call 'death'. Therefore we would ask if it is not po ssible that this reaction to certain stimuli is not within all, but within some?\" \"If these exceptions you speak of, can withstand being provoked or stimulated in any way - and not respond - then the answer may be 'yes',\" I told him. \"But should there be any response to provocation, danger or any other vexation, then we must assume that the primal-core does exist within their brains. As I've repeatedly told you, fear is a part of the instinctual response-mechanism and is a major factor in animal survival.\" \"We understand that you seek to show us that this is necessary,\" he responded. \"But there have been many who have demonstrat ed this to be incorrect.\" \"Can you give me an example?\" I asked. \"Your Teachers. That which you term your Saviours,\" he replied, and I assumed he was talking primarily of Jesus, Buddha, Mohamed, and possibly several of the saints, martyrs and other 'prophet-figures' in various religious orders both present and past. \"I believe that they, too, felt and feared the physical torture and pain inflicted upon them before they died,\" I insisted. \"To fear physical pai n is a primal reaction. To rise above it in mind and spirit bespeaks extreme courage and purpose. This , I believe, is mind over matter at its highest"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":" 111 level, and yet, within their body structures, the primal-core fear-mechanism still remained.\" \"Within the brain?\" Monitor asked. \"Yes, within the brain,\" I insisted. \"That is the very point I've been trying to make.\" But Monitor was determined to get in the last word. \"And, as we have stated, the true spark of your kind - our kind - overcomes the brain,\" he said. \"That is the dichotomy of Earthly existence,\" I to ld him. \"We are forced to live with two often opposing forces within one body-structure: We have the eternal ethereal spirit living within the gross physical being, with each striving desperately to dominate the other.\" \"But you must understand who, or what, is the most dominant,\" he chided me. \"The body can be destroyed, but the spirit cannot.\" \"I agree with you one hundred percent!\" I told hi m. \"All I have been trying to do is to answer - as honestly as possible - your constant questions r egarding 'fear'. I'm only trying to explain it, not rationalize it.\" \"We are also seeking to understand and, in understanding, we can overcome it, thereby making our entry into your world a peaceful one,\" Monitor stated. \"That would be good. It is our aim to help you achieve this goal.\" This little debate - or discussion - started me thinking of how simple things would be for all human beings if we were to indulge in serious introspection as to just who, or what, we really are. If we were to learn how to evaluate our own duality and more important assess the degree of 'grossness' that lies within each of us by accepting that there is a primal core brain lying at the very root of our developed brains. . . and that this physical ‘ organ ’ exists in all human beings regardless of how pious or innocent they may appear to be . . . then, and only then, will we mentally divorce ourselves from our primitiv e bodies long enough to understand that all so-called 'desires of the flesh' are entirely physical in nature and c an be totally overridden by the mind should"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":" 112 we choose to do so. All we need to do to accomplish the overthrow of this gross-factor within us is - according to the Monitors - to raise our vibrational level above that of our physical bodies. \"If the mind can overcome the body,\" he told us , \"then the body will refine. And the faster the vibration, the more etheric you become and the less hold the Earth's atmosphere will have upon you. \"When we walk upon the Earth, we come in a 'suit', as you would term it, which appears to those viewing to be solid. And yet this is a vibrational device which enables us to appear as you would see us.\" \"Is this a mechanical-vibrational device?\" I asked. \"This is, as you would term, a 'mechanical' device.\" \"You mean you are merely lowering the vibrati onal rate so that your etheric energy will manifest as matter?\" \"This is correct.\" “ Thank you for that insight. ” I then glanced at my notes and switched to another subject. - * - * - * - I was interested in learning more about the Pleiadians themselves. Their background, their history, their legends and, if possible, something about the social structure within which they existed. I also wanted to get an idea of just how advanced they were in comparison to our present technology. Monitor seemed more than willing to share this knowledge. \"We would be, as you would term it, three to four thousand years in advance of Earth technology. However, in the 'mind', as you would term it, we would be in some instances,"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":" 113 immeasurably ahead. \"You ask, do we have legends? You are seeking as to a structure of our society?\" \"Yes.\" I replied. \"We would offer you that we do, indeed, have our legends and our stories and our past. In our legend, and past, you are contained,\" he said. Frankly, at the time, I was too taken aback by this piece of information to pursue it further. However, I made a note to dig deeper into this part of their history to find out exactly where it was that we fitted into their legends. \"Do you have a hierarchy within your system? A government?\" I asked. \"There is a 'government' of the Universe,\" he replied. \"It would be, as you term it, a ‘ Council ’ .\" \"In which dimension does this exist? Is it a physical dimension, like our Third?\" \"If necessary, it can manifest within the physical,\" he answered. \"How do you and your fellow Pleiadians exist wi thin the Pleiades? Do you manifest there, too? \" \"In a physical form, as you would know it, but with refinement not quite as material . . . as solid . . . as your structure. Ours is a refined structure,\" he explained. \"You would see us as you have observed physical matter with your peripheral vi sion. If you look with Third dimensional eyes, we would not appear as solid as you, for the frequency in which we exist is merely higher than yours. It is much like your mechanical devices for entertainment.\" \"Are you talking about our television - our holograms?\" \"This is correct.\" \"When you travelled to this Solar System from the Pleiades, were you in the Third, or in another dimensional form?\" \"This was, as you would term it, in both,\" he replied. \"For it is within the craft that we retain"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":" 114 Third dimensional form. However, by use of the force fields without of the craft, we would not be perceived in this form.\" I was most anxious to garner information about their spacecraft and asked Monitor if it would be possible for him to describe the inside of it for us. He obliged quite readily and I asked if, perhaps, he might shed some light on the technical aspects of its function. \"I assume its motive source - the propulsion power - is derived from a combination of matter and anti-matter. Is this correct?\" I asked. \"This is correct,\" he replied. \"Also the use of magnetic fields.\" \"May we just explore the motive forces first, and then return to the magnetic fields in a few moments?\" I asked. \"Your propulsive forces are fuelled by matter-anti-matter, as you've just acknowledged, but are we talking about this energy being directed through a 'vibrational device' in order to create the propulsive energy levels you require?\" \"We define it as 'vibrational', yes,\" he replied. In order to determine whether or not the information I had been receiving independently of the sessions with Carole was valid I next described in a fair amount of detail how, by converting it into pure energy, the original fuel (matter-anti-matter) was used to power the actual propulsion system. For obvious reasons, I cannot go into this information here, but suffice it to say that the principle behind it is extremely simple and easy enough to comprehend. I asked Monitor if my description was correct. \"This is correct,\" he replied. \"Now, if we create around the outer skin of your craft a higher vibrational level by using an electro-magnetic field to develop a magnetic 'resonance' or frequency. . . \" \"Frequency is correct,\" he interjected. \". . . we can produce a higher vibrational frequency outside and around the craft that will"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":" 115 allow it to pass into another dimension. Is this anywhere near correct?\" I asked him. \"This is correct,\" he stated flatly. \"Alright, let's continue.\" I paused for a moment to fully concentrate on the hypothesis I was trying to get across to him. \"So we would now be able to leave the Third dimension because of the higher vibrational level that has been magnetically induced around and through the outer skin of the craft. Instantly, we would no longer exist within the Third dimension and find ourselves within the higher vibrational levels of the next dimension!\" I was inwardly excited by this insight into the possible function of a UFO. Monitor injected a note of caution. \"And if this is not calculated with great care. . . \" he intoned, \". . . Dilation and destruction will occur.\" \"This I comprehend,\" I assured him, \"But once in the next dimension, tim e - as we know it - will ceases to exist.

Is this about right?\" \"This is also correct.\" \"Then I'm confused,\" I told him. \"I thought you said earlier, that due to the closing of the dimensional gates, you were unable to return to the Pleiades?\" \"We were talking of your body-structures, not of ours.\" \"But aren't you trapped here, too?\" I asked. \"Or am I confused in this area, also?\" \"We are not trapped,\" he replied. \"We choose to be here. We are here on a mission to help Man, and to structure our own physical body-structures for the times of 'change'. \"We come close to Earth. . . take Third dimensional form. . .and then we return to the Mother Ship,\" he explained. \"There are many craft within the Mother Ship, for it remains, as you"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":" 116 would call it, a 'planet', self-contained in all ways.

My first session with Carole and the Mitchell-Hedges Crystal Skull a few years earlier had left me in a bit of a daze. The material I had received during Carole's trance-channel state (that later became the first session in, ‘ The Skull Speaks ’ ) was more than I could swallow at the time. It took about a year and a half before I was willing to accept it, edit it, and eventually see it in print. But from whence came this remarkable intelligence we had been receiving? I didn't know for sure, and it was not until after we had been working on the book for some time that it dawned on me that the Crystal Skull itself, awe-inspiring and beautiful as it is, was actually no more that a 'conductor' for Carole's channelling. Time and time again, she would call me after a session with additional information she said she was receiving from the same source we had tapped earlier via the Crystal Skull. It was because of this 'bleed- through' material that the truth finally dawned: It was Carole who was the medium - NOT the Crystal Skull! As I have already mentioned in an earlier chapter, the Crystal from which the skull is fashioned is no more than an 'oscillating device' that had enabled her to tune into a remarkable source of intelligent information. Unfortunately, by the time I fully realized this, the Mitchell-Hedges Crystal Skull had in the eyes of many become the 'message ' rather than the tool of the 'medium'. As a result, the material being channelled through Carole was being credited to the skull itself, and not to the 'source' from whence it had come. It was too late to remedy it. Some people bought our book because they believed the Crystal"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":" 118 Skull was some kind of magical 'container' with supernatural powers. It wasn ’ t then, and it isn' now. And that ’ s it, period! What is it? It is no more than an incredibly beautiful work of art of unknown origin , made by either one, or several, extraordinarily talented crafts-people at some time in the past. To equate it with a ‘ magic bottle ’ supposedly filled with an intelligence of its own, is akin to claiming your radio or television set or even your telephone is the ‘ source-container ’ of everything that comes through it. It was because of this misconception that I asked Monitor to explain the reason why Carole and I had been drawn together, and for what purpose. \"When I first came to you, it was through the Mitchell-Hedges Crystal Skull. Why did you find it necessary to use the Skull in order to bring us together?\" I asked him. \"We did not find it necessary. You did. For at that time you were - as you still are - seeking 'outside' confirmation (of something you already 'inwardly' knew). The Crystal that you speak of was merely a way of opening a door gently,\" he said. \"This mind is timid, even now, in its understanding of what you would term, extra-terrestrial life, therefore we seek to make it more harmonious. \"That which you term the Crystal Skull is no more than a vibration which oscillates through the Universe and is, as you would term , a Conductor,\" he told me. \"This mind needed to be awakened, even though gently, to the next level of understanding.\" It was only then that I realized Monitor was referring to my mind, not Carole's. He continued. \"Otherwise it would have remained complacent in its understanding of the light of Earth.\" \"And how do you find this mind now?\" I asked. \"This mind is receptive because the personality is impatient. Therefore it is constantly searching and searching. And, when it comes to an understanding, it merely catalogues and moves on. It has needed someone to extract the cataloguing of many lifetimes, therefore we are"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":" 119 able to use, even now, information which has been stored without the intellectual knowledge being intimidated. As it is with this mind (meaning Carole ’ s mind), it is also with your mind. That which you call 'idea' is but 'thought-energy' - energy that is fed and has been fed into the mind to be used at the appropriate awakening.\" It was his reference to 'thought-energy' that triggered something I had once either read, heard, or seen on TV, regarding Nikola Tesla, the brilliant inventor who pioneered so many breakthroughs in the field of electromagnetic science. His ideas, he claimed, did not originate in his mind, but came from somewhere else. He was merely an instrument of reception, a seer! And now , I too - just like Tesla - wanted to know where this 'thought-energy' came from, and why some people who are often labelled 'bright', 'brilliant' or even 'genius' are, in fact, no more than good receptors spouting ideas from other planes that just seem to ‘ pop ’ into their heads. \"We have a tendency to call anyone even remotely creative, a 'genius' ” I told him. “ I think the term, ‘ genius ’ is misused - a misnomer - because it doesn't give credit to either the source of the inspiration, or from whence came the seed of the idea.\" \"We ask you to listen to the sound of the word 'genius',\" he told me. We would say 'genes' and we would say 'intelligence'. With each gene there is a tiny fragment of intelligence. When it is scattered, as it so often is like any energy, it is not made manifest. However, when the mind and the brain and the body are in harmony to communi cate and align this energy, then you have the manifestation of the so called 'genius'.\" I laughed. \"That throws my theory for a loop!\" I told him. \"I had believed these so-called 'geniuses' were no more than good 'receptors' or 'mediums' who were actually getting their ideas from the Universal Bank of Knowledge.\" \"This is correct,\" said Monitor. \"We would ask you to listen as to what we have described."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":" 120 We would simplify and say; liken the collecting process to that of building a communicator such as the one you have in this area,\" he said, referring to the T.V. set in the room. He continued. \"When all working parts are in alignment, then the communicator and the communication are as one.\" \"Why is it that only a few people - only a certain number of people - are chosen to bring new ideas into this world ?\" I asked. \"You use the word 'chosen' to separate them ? To isolate them?\" \"Well they are few and far between, are they not?\" I countered. \"Are you not 'chosen'? Are you not 'genius' in other terms?\" \"My God, no!\" I exploded, \"I am no more than a good receptor. Period!\" \"Thus do many of your geniuses also subscri be. They will say it is a gift from God, and do not attach it to the personality.\" I could not help but agree with his assessment, not because he was trying to include me in the collective terminology, but because the few true 'geniuses' I have met over the years, have for the most part been a most self-depreciating group of people. 'Genius' has a ring to it which, in many instances, the fragile ego craves. In the eyes of many, it separates the men from the boys in much the same way letters of academic achievement (i.e. B.A., M.A., Ph.D. etc. ) separate students from the graduates and hereditary titles of nobility provide that great divide between plebeian, aristocrat, and the ‘ Royals ’ . But letters and titles are man-made labels. They should never be confused with that 'Gift from the Gods ’ that not only allows you to listen to your inner voice - but also lets you heed what it is telling you! Such gifts are the keys that can unlock all doors to that vast pool of knowledge that lies beyond our Third dimension.

They merely"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":" 121 pass in and out of my consciousness for presentation to whichever 'source of intelligence' happens to be available at the time. Edison, when asked to define genius, claimed it was one percent ‘ inspiration ’ , and 'ninety- nine percent perspiration' . He was one hundred percent right! The research and follow up research that most inventors have to go through in order to bring an idea into reality, is paved with setbacks and obstacles. And, as an inventor who has been down that road myself, I can vouch for the fact that a large part of the ‘ perspiration-factor ’ Edison mentioned can today be attributed to the Patent Offices in various countries, the Patent Attorneys who charge an arm and a leg for their services, plus the myriad other hurdles put in the way of would-be inventors by a bureaucratic and unwieldy system that favours the wealthy multi-nationals and mega-giant corporations over the poor under-funded ‘ back-room ’ entrepreneur. Nevert heless, regardless of all of these man-made trials and tribulations surrounding the inventor, the nucleus of an idea - any and all ideas - are freely given to anyone who dares to think, dream, and listen to their inner voice. It is that simple! The endless ‘ Source of Knowledge ’ that is open to any mind that wishes to tap into it, belongs to the whole Universe; to All of us. . . and no single idea is ever given to one person alone . It is given to many. And the idea is but the seed, for it is only after an idea is conceived, gestated, and nurtured through to term, that it becomes a viable reality. And, as any inventor - or mother - well knows, the process of conception, gestation and birth can be either a joy to end all joys, or a painful experience. Is man the only creative creature on Earth? Are we the only life form capable of inspiration, invention and the development of feasible notions? Do animals have the ability to create and"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":" 122 develop ideas? Are there, perhaps, ‘ geniuses ’ walking around among the higher primates - the gorillas, orangutans, chimpanzees? I asked Monitor to tell me to what heights any of these magnificent creatures might aspire. \"They will continue to refine until they reach a level of understanding,\" he replied. He paused, and seemed somewhat puzzled by my reason for asking the question. \"Do you seek to ask if they will become as mankind ?\" He asked. I told him no, that was not the purpose of the question. \"My concern is one of compassion for these beautiful creatures,\" I explained. \"Man is destroying their habitat, poisoning their environment and, worse still, capturing and breeding some of them for use in medical research and biological experiments.\" \"Such as mankind would also be used in?\" He asked. \"Yes, man has been used by some scientists,\" I admitted. \"My concern, though, is for the emotional stress and physical suffering these harml ess creatures are forced to undergo. Why must such cruel experiments be inflicted upon such helpless animals?\" \"We would ask you the same question,\" he countered. \"It is the seeking of the intelligence factor that your scientists are looking for, for t hey still ascribe (the seat of all man's intelligence as belonging) to the bodily structure and to the brain rather than the mind. And they use lower forms of their life-forms as they seek to research into something of which they have no understanding.\" \"Why should these creatures - these animal forms - be described as 'lower forms'?\" \"It is only by mankind they are designated as 'lower forms'.\" \" Do you believe they are?\" I asked. \"ALL intelligent life is as ONE. We do not have the understanding of 'lower forms' of life. We only understand the term 'Gross' as a descriptive for lack of spiritual understanding.\" \"Is it possible for 'spiritual' man - the soul-ener gy of man- to become a part of everything?\" I asked him, \"To embrace all, and to feel as everything around us feels ?\""},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":" 123 \"Yes, it is possible,\" he replied. \"Then at what stage of our progression will this happen?\" \"At that stage (where) you will have no need to retu rn to the Third dimensional form unless it is through a desire to help. Such has been demonstrated by those that your history has noted.\" Monitor stopped speaking for a few moments and, as I pondered what he had just said, I felt a series of deep emotional twinges as flashes of the sheer beauty of nature swirled through my mind. \"It's strange, but I sometimes have incredible feelings of love for this planet . . .and for everything on it.\" I told him. Monitor's voice - channelling through Carole - sounded soft and full of compassion. \"That is why we are manifesting in a stronger form,\" he said. \"So that you - and all like- minds - will be able to make a correction.\" \"I hope it will be soon.\" \" We also desire that it should . . . in your understanding . . . be soon,\" he said. There is a remarkable phenomenon that occurs whenever a really significant message is received from either Monitor or, from what I believe to be, the Source of Universal Knowledge. The words themselves are NOT the total message, for each communication can often have a different meaning to the many different people who may receive it . The reception of a message can be altered by many factors and coloured by the make-up and experiences of the receptor. It is because of this that the true meaning of a message is not just contained in the words of the sender, but also in the heart of the receiver. Many people have told us that, time and time again, they have repeatedly returned to the pages of 'The Skull Speaks' in search of answers to different problems that had confronted them at various times. And, when they do this, they say they are often able to find an answer that will fill"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":" 124 their specific need. Some have even referred to it as being 'revelational' material in context. I decided I would ask Monitor about this phenomenon. \"Is it possible that words - in themselves - have no real meaning as such but are actually ' conveyers ' of a very broad spectrum of knowledge?\" I asked. \"In much the same way a beam of light is also a 'conveyance' for a broad spectrum of wavelengths?\" I paused to allow him to digest my question, then added, \"Every colour in the rainbow lies within a single beam of visible light, and yet none can be seen until it is refracted through some form of a prism. Only then are we able to experience the full content of the 'message' (the full spectrum of colour) the light brings to us. Is this really what your words . . . your messages . . . are designed to convey?\" \"This is correct. And we have, earlier this day, anticipated you would question our communication, and we ask you to pay very specific attention to the words before they are given out. There are many different meanings and thr ough your mind you will open the path as to the (general) understanding (by choosing) which way a word will be used.\" It is interesting to note that Monitor's statement about having earlier anticipated my question was, at the time, unknown to me. Carole had brought a tape with her on which she had taped - that very morning - a message concerning an earlier communicati on. And, lo and behold, the postscript did, in fact, include a warning about paying special attention to the employment of words! I explained to Monitor that I had only my intuition on which to base the final editing of this book. Nothing else. \"Why do you belittle that which is the ‘ Source? ’ \" \"Because of me, the interpreter,\" I replied. \"It is not the 'Source' I ’ m belittling, but rather the many flaws within me - the 'receptor' - that concern me.\" \" Within all Third dimensional life there are flaws,\" he stated. \"As there are flaws also in many who are within the Universe.

When the energy becomes pure there are no flaws.\" With those words of wisdom ringing in my ears, he closed the subject. - * - * - * -"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":" 126 XIII   ========================   MAN-MADE HAZARDS I returned to the subject of the predicted earth changes and expressed my concerns regarding the potential for disaster that lies in the multiple hazardous man-made products scattered through-out the world. \"I ’ m speaking here of chemical hazards, nuclear hazards, bio-chemical warfare hazards, and the stockpiles of hundreds of other unstable elements man, in his blind folly, has created upon this planet. What will happen to all of these hazardous materials when earthquakes and other seismic activities tear nuclear reactors apart, rupture the storage facilities of deadly materials that will, inevitably, leach into lakes, rivers, oceans and the atmosphere?\" I asked him. \"Will there be enough people alive - nuclear technicians, chemists, engineers, etcetera - to both contain and clean up the mess? ” I was thinking of Three Mile Island in the USA, Chernobyl in the USSR. Bhopal in India, and the Exxon Valdez Oil disaster in Alaska. These, plus the hundred or more other major oil and chemical spills that have occurred over the past tw enty years are not something that can be swept under a rug and forgotten. \"You are perceiving a possibility,\" he replied. \"However, you must understand that, as we communicate with you, there are many others wi th whom we are also communicating. We have given to them, as we have given to you, the ways and means to avert many disasters. It is your understanding, that all is to be eradicated. This is not the plan for the Earth . There will be those who will leave into the next dimension,\" he said, m eaning those who will be killed, \"but there will by"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":" 127 many also who will come in to your bodily form.\" By this, he was telling us that although many will die, there will also be those who will be born to take their place. Monitor continued. \"These children, as you term them, will find they have the way to make many of man's inventions redundant. Man, since time began to manifest in this intelligence, is merely trying to ‘ speak ’ the vibration of the Earth itself, and of the body form, so that he may return from whence he came. Earth is but a synthesized form of many life forms therefore in trying to duplicate by mechanical and intellectual understanding there has been a malfunction. We seek, however, to hold the pattern and allow man to evolve or to ‘ spiritualise ’ so that Earth may, once again, be a ‘ reflection ’ if man lives compatibly with man.\" As Monitor had raised the issue about the compatibility of various creeds and races I was immediately interested in pursuing the race-creed-intelligence quotient factor with him. At the time of that session, there had been a great deal of media hype over a paper published by Professor Rushton of the University of Western Ontario in Canada, in which he claimed there are different levels of intelligence for different racial groups. I asked Monitor if there was any validity to the hypothesis. \"By 'intelligence', is he using the term in the intellectual understanding?\" He asked. \"There are many uses for the word 'intelligence'. You will define for us.\" I was put on the spot. Not having a clear definition at hand, I winged it as best I could. \"Intelligence, I believe, presumes an ability to learn from experience and be able to utilize the knowledge in a creative way to comprehend and evaluate that which is around one.\" I replied, hoping I hadn't misconstrued it by too much. I had fully expected Monitor to respond to my question by linking the degree of a soul- spirit ’ s refinement to the various levels of intelligence in man. I queried him on it. \"Surely the soul - the reincarnating spirit - determines the level of intelligence in an"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":" 128 individual, not the race, creed or anything else. Is this not correct ?\" I asked. \"We offer you this understanding,\" he replied. \"When a consciousness goes through a reincarnation, it is the experience for that particular time and place that it needs to know - and undergo - for the purification and speeding up of its vibration. As we have just stated, when this man ( Rushton) talks, he talks of the brain's ability to remember, retain and repeat that which has been given and indoctrinated into the brain. We offer you that the races to whom he credits the highest intelligence are not the most creative. Creativity is an area which is not related directly to intelligence. You will find many upon your Earth w ho are designated by man's understanding of intelligence as retarded, as brain-damaged, as imbeciles and yet these people are able to create with most beauty. They are able to reproduce the playing of instruments and music, yet their ability to understand, to read, to learn, is greatly im paired. Therefore we would ask you once again, to remember - as you have stated yourself - the use of words.\" \"I presume you are talking of the 'idiot-savant syndrome ’ that can be found among some mentally challenged people?\" I asked. \"But are they not of your seeding. . . of your intelligence? Were they not directly related to the Star People. . . to you?\" \"Constantly you refer to us as if we were other than yourself,\" he admonished. \"Constantly we remind you that you are a part of the whole.\" He paused for a moment before continuing. \"Yes, they were a manifestation closer to their original source, but still they were an Earth manifestation. You have to realize that when an energy comes into an area of density, it will either destroy, be destroyed, or adapt. We felt is nece ssary - as did the indivi dual personality - to adapt. But, in that adaption, there was a loss.\" \"Then what about the concept of ‘ Heaven ’ ? ” I asked. “ Or a belief in 'Other Worlds', in 'Spirit Voices', and so on. Weren't these notions originally put into the heads of man by the Star People?\". \"We would explain further,\" he answered. \" When, at the time of the (initial) change upon the"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":" 129 Earth, there remained those who underwent a change in density. Their ability to perceive and hold onto the higher vibration became less and less. Ther efore they became, as you would understand, a slower vibration compatible with their surroundings and therefore they had to undergo a refining process.\" He paused. \"Thus death and reincarnation belong to the Earth. “ If you can understand a 'belt' around your Earth - invisible forces holding this mani- festation of mankind close to the Earth - you will see what was holding the soul-spirit of man to your planet. It is constantly moving as the consciousness (of the soul-spirits) moved in and out as it refined and refined, yet they could not completely escape for by now it (this ‘ belt ’ ) had undergone change.\" As Monitor spoke, I was again led to envision the magnetosphere around our Earth in which lay the Van Allen Radiation Belts and Plasmasphere. And as I did so, a ‘ picture ’ began to formulate in my mind in such a way that, for the first time , I was clearly able to see what it was that was preventing our soul-spirits from leaving these Earth-bound environs. I was slowly being given information as to (a) how our souls had become trapped (b) at what time in Earth's history they had become trapped and, most importantly, (c) when ALL of the soul-spirits imprisoned here would fi nally be released to return from whence they (we) had come! It was an incredibly exciting moment. However, more about this later. Monitor continued. \"It is in coming to you now that we seek to make higher the Earth's vibration and the structure. Also of the body so that, should it be necessary, we will be able to remove you from the scene of great destruction.\" There was a slight pause before he continued. \"We again emphasize,\" he said, an edge of urgency in his voice, \"that you must make changes within the Earth.\" I assured him I understood what he was telling us, and told him we would do our best to pass the information on to those who will listen to his words. Hopefully, the L-MP ’ s of this world"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":" 130 will rally to the cause. - * - * - * - I wanted to probe deeper into the subject of the so-called 'Spirit Voices' who - over countless centuries - have been the 'conveyers of information ’ to mankind by using so-called 'gifted' people to carry their words of wisdom. And their numbers are legion. The Greek oracles, the Wise Men of the East, Witches, Seers and innumerable Prophets, Priests and other high-ranking religious leaders who on the strength of what they claimed to have been told by the 'Spirit-Voices' were able to garner followers from all walks of life, create new cults, and even build vast religious empires simp ly by convincing their followers that they were acting on the word of God! \"What is frighteningly important to the world right now,\" I told him \" Is that millions upon millions of people all over the globe are members or followers of a number of diverse religious orders or cults who blindly accept the words of leaders who claim their words are coming directly from the highest of the highest realms of light and understanding. These followers believe implicitly that their religious leaders communicate with 'God'. Would you please clarify this phenomenon?\" \"We would offer you this thought\" he replied. \"Within the Earth there are those who remain within the structure of the next dimension known to you as the 'spirit world'. These are without bodily form or structure but are in close contact with the source from whence they originally came. \"They remain there thus to communicate with those upon the Earth who are able to hear them. And they impart to them knowledge which is to be used for the betterment of mankind. However, it is often the way that the ego will be stronger than the spirit and given full energy to run its course the ego will override the spiritual aspects of man. We offer you this concept as we have before: The Nazarene (Jesus) came to you as one of you. He came in male form to teach, to"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":" 131 offer, to show the way.\" \"From whence did he come?\" I asked. \"He was of the Pleiadian structure.\" \"Which is, in fact, from the same place you are from.\" \"Which is the same as the communicating origins of this one,\" he admitted. I confess that I wasn't at all surprised by his answer. There are many instances recorded in the New Testament about Jesus that will substantiate what Monitor was saying. He continued. \"He was able to understand his original source, and he had not to undergo the 'purification' that mankind has to undergo,\" he said. \"He was in close contact with his source.\" \"But was not his physical being - his Earthly conception - 'seeded' by the Star People, the Pleiadians?\" I asked. \"The 'personality' was, as you put it, 'seeded',\" he replied. \"Was this the 'immaculate conception', as we know it?\" \"We understand your term (terminology). However, we do not understand your theory.\" I explained that in recent times there have been many reports of UFO abductions all over the world in which hundreds of women had been clinically 'seeded' by their abductors while their minds were totally blank. It was only later they discovered they had become pregnant without having had intercourse with a man. Such an occurrence could easily be translated as an 'immaculate conception' by any woman unaware she had been fertilized by extraterrestrial beings. I asked him if the seeding was, in fact, done by the Pleiadians. \"That is correct,\" he responded. \"But this is not, as your words would denote, unusual,\" he assured me. \"I didn't think it was unusual,\" I told him, \"not in light of the impregnated abductees. So why was Jesus considered so unusual in the eyes of man?\" \"He was an example; a Prophet. He brought information ahead (of its time) for the"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":" 132 understanding of man.\" \"Is this not what we discussed earlier about the concept of 'Genius'?\" I asked. \"This is correct.\" \"We are talking here of Religious Leaders. . . \" I started to say, but Monitor interjected. \"Why do you term the passing on of information as 'religious'?\" He asked. \"It has nothing to do with religion or the concept of religion.\" \"Regrettably,\" I told him, \"In this day and age, it has. We are talking about nations who are at war with each other in the name of 'religion'. . . people who are fighting, torturing, killing and murdering each other. . . ALL in the name of their own particular religion.\" \"They are inspired, controlled, and dominated. They merely use this as a camouflage for the releasing of gross energies ” he said. \"Yes, and all done in the name of their Prophets,\" I added drily. \"This sound of 'religion' stirs within the Earth, yet the taking of life is not (of) a higher vibration. We ask you again to look and understand the teachings. We look, and we ask you to look, at the concept of fear. . . that which you have enlightened us as being still within the brain of man,\" he said, referring, of course, to the R-factor - the primal-core - and the base survival instincts in all creatures. \"It is still the remnants of the Gross Being and not yet refined. It is well hidden and it is not recognizable until demonstrated by many. Man has learned to be a 'camouflage' as you would term it in many things. And, indeed, the Gross Being intelligence has learned to lie dormant until conditions are ripe for it to manifest in the most horrendous of ways. It will take the personality of man and it will twist and turn and writhe until it has the mind of man into a confused communication of its higher self. And there it will manifest. \"In all religions you will find a structured way of quietening the mind, ” he told me. ” You will find a way used to dominate with the use of sound; the use of large collections of humanity in one"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":" 133 place all looking to the one energy source to be triggered within each of them.\" \"Then why is it I continually see only one solution for our planet. . . only one solution to stop what man is doing to it?\" I asked. \"And what is that solution?\" \"The annihilation of countless millions of people,\" I told him. \"There are too many G-B ’ s in the world who see no wrong at all in wars and violence, in polluting of our environment, in destroying the ecosystem and decimation of species of life as long as it brings them profit. They hate for the sake of hating, fight for the sake of fighting, and have neither concern nor compassion for anyone, or anything, that gets in their way. \"Why do I keep seeing this future vision of total catastrophe - of destruction - and, inwardly, believe that it will be a good thing for our world to be 'cleansed' through the mass extinction of grossest of mankind?\" Monitor waited patiently for me to pour out my innermost feelings on this horrendous issue before he replied. \"You have come to an understanding,\" he said simply. \"But we would ask you to look to your use of the word, 'destruction', as you view it. It is merely 'change', just as death is merely change. \"Slowly you are coming to the understanding whic h we gently tried to broach when we were first in communication with you. That death is not as you perceive it to be. It is merely a change. Destruction, as you would perceive it, is merely change.\" There was I, harbouring incredible feelings of guilt for the thoughts that had filled my mind for so long, and now here was Monitor telling me in the simplest terms, what life and death were really all about. I felt as if an enormous weight had been lifted from my shoulders. It is, after all, our own personal concept of 'death coupled with the underlying primal-core fear factor that forces us to perceive 'death' as the absolute end of the line - oblivion - instead of what it really is, 'change'. I fired yet another question at him."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":" 134 \"Will we ever be rid of the bad influences that prevail upon this planet?\" I asked. \"I mean the Gross-Beings?\" \"The density which prevails will be lifted,\" he replied. \"It must be lifted. And, yes, you will be a part of it. . . you will assist. However, that which you call 'calamity' is merely the change that has to take place. This is not only the doing of man, for there are also planetary alignments which are coming into force that make the pressures upon planet Earth great,\" he said. \"But it is also a time when the dimensional gates will, once more, be aligned with the coming of the New Planet 2 which will be perceived in your space-time.\" This ‘ New Planet ’ , of which he speaks will in all probability herald the changes that will lead to the opening of the 'dimensional gates'. It will be yet another tangible clue to the accuracy of Monitor's statements for, as far as I know at th is time, any new planet' entering our solar system, would - in all probability - be the last thing our astronomers would expect. Monitor continued. \"You will understand why it is that we feel an urgency for education and communication,\" he said. \"Education and communication by whom?\" I asked. \"Am I right in assuming that this information you are passing along to us is only for the eyes and ears of L-MP ’ s? Is this correct?\" \"It is for all who will accept,\" he replied. \"Those who will not accept it need further refine- ment, therefore they will have their opportunities to refine.\" \"But they will reject all such opportunities.\" \"It is understood,\" he agreed. \"They will reject, and as you would term it, turn upon each other as has happened many times throughout the history of the Earth. And they will destroy each other,\" he replied. Time and time again - without getting a specific answer - I have tried to get Monitor to  2 Possibly referring to the NEW PLANET in our solar system discovered in the KUIPER BELT (that lies beyond Pluto) by Lawrence Wasserman & his team at Lowell Observatory.(News report BBC News Journal 03/07/2001)"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":" 135 pinpoint exactly when the first Star-People arrived on this planet. Now, as Monitor had just raised the point about the history of the Earth, I thought I'd try again. \"In terms of Earth years, when did you first co me to this planet?\" I asked him. \"And when did you first 'seed' mankind here? ” \"You seek for us to give you a quotation in your figures?\" \"I need to establish, conclusively, the point where 'mankind' had its beginnings on this planet. . . the time when man evolved after the seeding of Homo erectus by the Star People.\" \"Do you mean 'intelligent man'?\" He asked. \"Yes, I do. Homo ( sapiens ) sapiens,\" I replied. \"Do you mean 'Pleiadian Man' ?\" \"No,\" I told him. \"Then we will check further for you.\" There was a long pause as Monitor consulted, I pr esumed, with other Monitors. He returned: \"It would be in the millions of your Earth years. As for a more defined answer, this will be given at a later date.\" Once more I was thwarted. He sensed my frustration and went a couple of steps further in order to placate me. \"And we will seek to be as specific as we can to your understanding. However, once again we advise you that you do not understand all in the workings of dimensions.\" \"That is very true,\" I conceded. \"I understand only a bare fraction of it.\" Monitor suddenly sounded a little uneasy and stated that if there were no more questions he would like to release Carole's mind. I told him there were many more questions to ask, but I would postpone them until the next session. I added that I wished to delve into the world of physics next time. \"We will release the mind and we will, indeed, prepare that (entity) which you term the"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":" 136 understanding of Earth's physics.\" I thanked him and was just about to wind the session to a close when he volunteered a somewhat startling statement. \"If you would care to perceive we will make our selves visual for you in nights that are clear,\" he stated. \"You will look into the night sky, in your usual way, and we will attempt to show you - once again - the spacecraft. 3 There may be some disruption in your energy flows within this confinement, however we will attempt to negate them. If we are unable to negate them, we would advise you that it is only temporary and you are not to be alarmed.\" I assured him I would look forward to such an event. - * - * - * -   3 The date of the Turks & Caicos sighting vs the date this was January 11, 1987.

Among some of these major religious orders are those whose followers are constantly being admonished that 'sinning' will bar them from entry into their particular ‘ Heaven ’ , and if they persist in ‘ sinning ’ they will be forever doomed to a life in 'Hell' ” . . \"However, the ‘ sinners ’ do have an 'out'. ” I told him. “ It is called a ‘ confession ’ . If they confess their sins to a priest, then they may be forgiven and their souls will be 'saved'. Would you care to comment on this?\" \"Define 'sin',\" he told me. \"That's a good, yet difficult, question to answer,\" I replied. \"A 'Sinner' would probably be someone who breaks the man-made laws of the chur ch, indulges in excesses of the flesh. . . breaks any of the Ten Commandments. . . offends others. . . indulges in bestial acts, and so on, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. The list seems to go on ad infinitum depending on one's particular race, grace, or branch of a specific religion.\" \"This is an attempt, once more, at dominance,\" he explained. \"We must understand that those who would dominate to the point of restricting the thought process of intelligent man, would be the Gross-Beings, for their greatest fear - if 'fear' be the right descriptive - is the fear of 'thought'. \"The Gross Being is a creature of habit, not thought. He is repetitive and slow in seeking. He"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":" 138 seeks neither outside nor within. That which they te rm 'sin' is merely a means of 'dominance'.\" \"So what you are saying is that this is st rictly a man-made device used to dominate their followers? Is that the essence of it?\" \"It is a Gross Being's device of dominance,\" he replied. \"The Nazarene (Jesus) taught and showed not of this. Whatsoever the Nazarene gave to planet Earth was of light - light being energy - and energy being a vibration which each could use. What the Nazarene said was, in effect, 'Come, follow me, believe in me and you shall enter the Kingdom of my Father.\" \"What exactly did he mean by this. . . especially in light of the fact that he was Pleiadian?\" I asked. \"He was demonstrating the use of different energies and, indeed, if you would but master them, the structure of the body would obey and the mind would be free of fear. \"Here, at this time, as you would term it, we demonstrate and use different forms of energies. When the Nazarene spoke, he would have used words to convey deeper meaning, thereby - once again - awakening the true Pleiadian-soul. It would be, as you would term it, like a key unlocking a mighty door for once the key turned and the tiniest atom of light pierces the consciousness of the mind, that individual would begin to rise to find himself - his true identity - joining with the true energies and, at last, going home.\" \"As the vibrational levels increase, one goes higher?\" I asked. \"Have you not experienced a change within t he body structure since we have changed the energy fields?\" He asked. \"Yes, I have indeed,\" I replied. \"Then this should be - for your mind - a greater understanding, a better 'proof' than any verbiage used. You have experienced the changes, therefore you are.\" \"This is very true. I have experienced, yes, but please bear in mind that I am not asking these questions for just my own edification, but also for others who will read and learn from your"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":" 139 answers.\" I explained. \"I continue to ask you many basic questions because it is possible the answers may have eluded me - personally - as well as other people.\" \"We are aware of your enquiring,\" he replied. \"H owever we must also remember that you, too, must experience.\" \"And learn. . . \" I added. \"Learning is done by the brain. Experiencing is done by the soul.\" I continued to question him on religious belief systems. \"Do you have a belief system, within the Pleiades, ” I asked, “ One that involves a Supreme Being - a Supreme 'God'?\" \"There is the Council,\" he replied, \"and there is the Creation.\" \"You are saying that this is part of the entire Universe?\" \"This is correct.\" \"So the 'Council of the Pleiades' is, in fact, the Supreme Being - the 'God' of 'All That Is'?\" \"This is incorrect. Each has its own Council.\" \"You mean each Galaxy, Solar System, or each Universe?\" I asked. \"Each Universe.\" \"Has its own Council?\" \"That is wrong. Each forms another, higher, Council.\" \"Does that higher Council have any effect upon us, here on Earth?\" \"Indeed.\" \"Would it be fair to assume that members of your Pleiadian Council might have been mistaken for 'Gods ’ by earlier Earth people?\" \"The term ( ‘ God ’ ) means, ‘ That which came from the Sky ’ , in the eyes of your Ancient people. And, indeed, they were your ancestors, those who were termed 'Gods'. \"But, in the broader sense of that which you are implying, we would have to say that the"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":" 140 Council do not consider they are 'Supreme,\" he said. \"Do they have a form of 'God' - or a 'Supreme Being' - over and above them?\" \"When intelligence (mind and soul) is as 'One', how can there be anything above?\" He asked. There was absolutely nothing I could add to that! - * - * - * - The never-ending strife between different fact ions has puzzled and troubled me since I was a boy. Why, in God's name must so-called 'civilized ’ man be forever in conflict with his neighbors? Monitor, I thought, may have an answer to this age-old question. \"On this planet we have at least two diamet rically opposed view points on virtually every subject under the sun. There are those who believe one thing - with all of their heart - and there are those who believe the exact opposite. Both are one hundred percent sure their own point of view is right, and that the other is wrong,\" I told him. \"I would like to know why this is prevalent throughout our world and, more importantly, why it has to be so?\" \"We have explained to you that the manifestation into Third dimensional life was to experience it,\" he replied, \"It was to be experienced and used for progression. However, at the time of the changes, a manifestation of 'emotion' became a part of the personality of the entrapped soul,\" he explained. \"And this sought only separation . . .separation. . . separation.\" I interpreted this response to mean that the soul-spirit can only experience Third dimensional emotions by being a part 'of the flesh' where pain, suffering, anger, hostility, jealousy, lust - and the thousands of other levels of emotion and feelings only a physical being is able to experience - is denied to them. This, I believe, is our soul-spirit's prime reason for existing in the Third dimension."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":" 141 Obviously, diametrically opposed points of view are a necessary ingredient in creating scenarios best suited to the development of emoti onal conflicts among the various human races. What I wanted to know was whether or not this is a 'designed' plan created by a ‘ master mind ’ intelligence to engender interaction between members of the human race to assure the maximum number of Third dimensional experiences possible during each incarnation? By stimulating and raising our multiple underly ing emotions to the point where hostilities and rivalries come to the boil, we are able to create an incredible number of combinations - or even permutations of combinations - that involve basic emotions which, when fully developed, will inevitably lead to open aggression; pitting man against man, woman against woman, father against son and so on down familial lines until inter-tribal rivalries and interracial disputes will inevitably deteriorate into even more glorious ' W ARS' where pain, suffering, hatred, compassion, sorrow, grief, fear and heroics may be ex perienced to the fullest degree. Then, finally - when it ’ s all over - the sides will earn a bonus gift of abject humiliation for the vanquished, and pride, glory and exhilaration for the victorious Soul-Spirits whose bodies are clothed in flesh. The analogy here, of course, is that diametrically opposed factions are akin to a knife and a sharpening steel: they each require the other if their ultimate purpose is to be fulfilled. - * - * - * - "},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":" 142 XV =========================================================== PSYCHIC PREDICTIONS, MAGNETIC FIELDS & PLASMA Since becoming professionally involved with Carole in the writing of ‘ The Skull Speaks ’ , I have had to do a fair amount of research in areas of various ‘ predictions ’ and discovered that many of the writers on the subject are either shamelessly plagiarizing each other, or all must share the same source of Universal Knowledge. My own experience now leads me to believe that about 70% fall into the first category, 20% into the second, and only a mere 10% or less fall into the realm of genuine prognostication. Many psychics claim to be in touch with UFO-Nauts and other Alien beings who, they claim, warn of future disasters and promise that when these disasters strike, they will be plucked to safety and transported to some sort of safe-haven in an a lien w orld. The theme is almost always the same, and has been played to death in books, the tabloids, sci-fi literature, motion pictures, and T.V. series alike. In the hope he would shed some light on the s ubject and, perhaps, separate the wheat from the chaff as far as the prognosticators are concerned, I asked Monitor to tell us something about the many ‘ psychic ’ individuals who claim to be in communication with the Star People. \"Some people claim that you, or other Star P eople, have promised to carry them to safety in the event of a world-wide catastrophe. Is this true?\" I asked him. His answer surprised me. \"There are those who have been in communication. There are those who have been told that, if it is their choice, they will be removed from the surface of the Earth,\" he replied. Then"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":" 143 paused, then added. \"This has also been imparted to you.\" \"What exactly do you mean when you say 'remo ved' from the surface of the Earth?\" I asked. \"In the event they so choose - when catast rophes once again plague the small planet Earth - we will, as before, remove to an area of safety those individuals who so desire to go.\" I told him that I recalled reading - many y ears ago - of a man in California by the name of Professor George Adamski (he called himself 'Professor' even though the article had stated he held no degree from any bona fide academy) who, along with a group of 'followers', claimed they had been warned by UFO-Nauts from Saturn that the end of the world wa s about due. He told his followers that they would all be flown to safety in a giant UFO. \"Many of these people sold off all of thei r worldly goods and possessions and waited atop a mountain somewhere in California for the UFO to come down and carry them away. His followers did as he had instructed, but alas for them, it never came to pass. Could you give us some insight into this?\" \"We would first ask why it would be necessary for the individuals - before they see the catastrophe arising in front of them - to dispose of personal items?\" \"Because they claimed they had been told to do so by the Space People. They acted in good faith,\" I told him. \"This would seem totally unnecessary since that of Earth would no longer be of value to them, or to their place of safety,\" he returned. \"We would then ask, from whence came this communication? We would look to the source - as always we must - and we would say; 'You, who are of the Earth, know of the Earth and its people therein. Those who claim to have a higher intelligence, and yet give instructions which would seem of less than higher intelligence - must be suspect. \"It would not seem logical for those on Earth to dispose of all they have when they can see"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":" 144 others (are still safe) around them, and can foresee with logic that the Earth is still as it was.\" He paused momentarily before continuing. \"When we talk of catastrophe, we talk of mighty upheavals of the Earth when there will be, in each and every mind, no doubt as to the times of change. We do not need to wait or remove (people) before the catastrophes occur. Those who seek to be removed to a place of safety should not wait upon a mountain top. It would seem they had mistaken the logic of the Earth by waiting for a carrier. One does not depart beforehand and then wait for a carrier to arrive. \"In the instance of a removal to our time zones, there will be no waiting. There will be no pre-determined arrival or departure area. Those w ho are called will know exactly when and where.\" referring, of course, to those people of Like-Minds. \"Thank you.\" I wanted to continue with this coming ‘ Earth-catastrophe theme ’ he had so often talked about, so I posed my next question. \"You mentioned in a former session something about the ‘ collapse of the balance structure of the Earth'. Were you, perhaps, meaning the collapse of the Earth's magnetic field?\" \"There are many balancing factors within the planet Earth,\" he replied. \"There is the magnetic field barrier (and) there are also the li ght and sound barriers - as you would know them - and, also, there are other barriers of which Earth science is not yet aware - although it is becoming aware, in its infancy. \"We also remind you of the balance of the other planets with which Earth is compatible.\" \"I would specifically like to talk about the Eart h's magnetic polarity reversal,\" I told him. \"Can you tell us when the last major reversal took place?\" \"There have been, in the history of the planet Earth, four-four (forty four) such changes - such complete changes. We would advise you that the last complete change would be that which"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":" 145 'ending' was noted here on Earth during the Atlantean times and the Mu time. \"Time in years would not be significant to you since they would be in 'light-Earth' years and dimensional changes are not registered in light-Earth years.\" \"You have used the term 'light years' many times, but I would like to point out that a 'light year' - at least, to us on Earth - means the dist ance light would travel (a t 186,000 miles per second) in one Earth year. Is it possible you mean Earth years ? Three hundred and sixty five days being equal to one Earth year? Which of these do you mean?\" \"When we are talking of measurement close within the Earth, we refer to the Earth year, as you would understand it,\" he replied. \"Thank you. Now I understand what you meant.\" \"Once you leave the Earth into the outer atmosphere and into other Universes, there is also a change in measurements, therefore we will try to accommodate you with measurements of 'time' as closely as we can perceive your understanding,\" he said. \"We would have to tell you that the last of the disruptions - such as will be apparent again - was close to three to four million years ago.\" \"You are not equating this period with the time of the Atlantean period, are you?\" I asked, somewhat dubiously. I was puzzled by the seeming discrepancies in his measurements of Time, especially when comparing it to the information Plato claimed to have learned from Solon (the Egyptian high priest and sage) regarding the fate of Atlantis. How, I w ondered, could he be talking in terms of millions of years in one breath, and about the 'Earth-changes' which purportedly took place during the demise of a continent Solon had referred to as Atlantis? In Herodotus', ‘ The Histories ’ , Solon refers to the sinking of Atlantis as having taken place an estimated 35,000 to 40,000 years before Plato visited Egypt. Further, from recent geological data, we know that magnetic pole reversals have occurred throughout our planet's history at the"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":" 146 rate of about approximately five times every 1,000,000 years, placing (theoretically) the last major reversal somewhere between 20,000 and 35,000 years ago. It should be added that there is some geological evidence pointing to the fact that we haven't had a total reversal in upwards of 700,000 to 750,000 years. As diplomatically as possible, I explained this seeming discrepancy to Monitor, telling him his estimates didn't seem to match either Solon's accounts or the geological-paleo-magnetic measurements that had been unearthed. I asked him to explain the seeming contradiction. \"This is not the same,\" he said, referring to the 4 to 5 million years he had mentioned re the demise of Atlantis. This we have tried to im press upon you through this communication and the communications before. You, constantly question as to when is the catastrophe, and we tell you, it is now. In your time. . . it is now! \" Monitor had - one more time - raised the issue of just how little time we have left before the Earth changes are upon us. Now I wanted to tackle him over the obvious relationship between these so-called 'changes' and his constant referrals to the re-alignment of the dimensional gates. He has repeatedly told us that we - our soul-spirits - have been trapped within the confines of Earth for countless centuries, and unable to return to our source of origin. But what exactly is it that is doing the trapping? What sort of intangible force can prevent an ethereal being from moving freely - without let or hindrance - between dimensional states? From the information I had been ‘ receiving ’ independently from Carole I was now sure I knew - at least hypothetically - the answer to this conundrum. I decided it was time to test it out on Monitor. After skimming through the information we had already gathered regarding our magneto- sphere and its relationship to the Van Allen Belts and Plasma-sphere, etc., I presented this possibly new theory to him."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":" 147 \"You have told us that our magnetosphere - this field that protects us like a giant 'bottle' around the planet - is about to suffer a reversal in polarity, and that when it happens the field will collapse. Is this correct?\" \"This is correct. . . in part,\" he replied. \"Would you tell me the part that is not correct?\" \"We remind you that the dimensional changes along with the magnetic changes play a great part in the understanding of the 'gates' and the understanding of that which was from our galaxy,\" he said. \"This, I understand,\" I answered. \"We have - trapped within this ‘ magneto-spheric bottle ’ - that which we call the 'plasma-sphere'. My question is this: Is it possible that the basic make-up of plasma and our soul-spirit is the same? \". \"It is,\" he replied, \"Inasmuch as the various make-ups can be aligned with Earth understanding. You talk now of 'substance'?\" \"Almost a non-substance. It is a state between matter and non-matter,\" I told him. \"It is sometimes referred to as 'the fourth state of matter'.\" \"Matter as you know it?\" \"Yes, indeed.\" \"It is not matter as we know it since our understanding of matter is vastly different,\" he said. \"Would you elaborate?\" \"We would offer you that much of what you consider to be matter is that which you would call 'reflected'.\" He sensed my negative reaction to the word, 'reflected' and offered a further suggestion to try and help me understand. \"There is understanding (of the term) if you research the words: 'Sound reflected'. You will find much understanding. The way it is presented in this communication is not in its most simplistic"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":" 148 form. Therefore we have to ask you to research (t he words) for there is a way of understanding that must be given to those who are in contact with you and the mind.

Reflected so much as it is a reflection of a source.\" \"We have been through this before,\" I said, some what wearily. \"But the terminology (you keep using ) has little or no meaning in the lexicon wi th which I am familiar. Outside of the generally accepted definitions used in a layman's understanding of physics or science, I ‘ m unable to find what you want me to find in the word 'reflected'.\" \"Then we must search,\" he replied. He was silent for a long moment before continuing. \"We would ask you to look in the area which would be the 'death syndrome ’ . The 'death syndrome ’ is when the soul leaves the body structure. (At that time) there is a measurable 'substance' similar in context to that which you have described,\" and I suddenly realized he was referring to the ‘ soul-spirit ’ as a form of 'plasma'. He continued. \"However, this is a reflection - a dimensional reflection - of the Source. \"It is still, as you would understand it, Third dimensional, but it is of a faster vibration, although not always apparent to the eye of the body. However, those who view the next dimension easily, view this substance easily. Those which you call 'psychic' - those which you call 'seer' - are able to tap this dimension because their minds have been opened to receiving these communica- tions. They are open to viewing this 'reflection'. It is open in much the same way as one would choose to tune an instrument of viewing; listening; and receiving, and becomes apparent to the brain and then to the eye,\" he concluded. \"I'm still not sure of the full meaning of ‘ reflected ’ ,\" I told him. \"So bear with me while I try another approach in order to gain a better understanding. ” \"A shadow has no substance, and yet it can be seen. Is this what you're talking about?\" I asked him."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":" 149 \"This is,\" he replied. \"You are saying that a shadow is a reflection of the source?\" \"This, in part, is correct, yes,\" he replied. \"Then please explain the part that needs to be filled in.\" \"The mind is the governor of this. We would offer you this understanding: When the mind is disturbed - whether it be in the body or without - it is strong enough to cause a dent or a mark within the dimension,\" he explained. \"When this happens, the mark is registered, and therefore, becomes dimensional.\" \"I'm beginning to understand,\" I told him, \"but I'm going to need more time to fully digest what you are saying.\" \"Let us also refer that understanding to that which surrounds your Earth,\" he said. \"Do you not see now where the Earth itself is also a creator of that which is around it? As are the minds which are around it.\" \"If it's possible to link the two together, then, yes, I can. What you are saying is, at the moment of death, a measurable plasmic substance (i.e the soul-spirit) leaves the material body and joins with the ‘ plasma-sphere ’ contained within the 'magnetic bottle' surrounding our Earth? Is that right?. \"This is correct,\" Monitor interjected. \"You are saying that this is where the ' soul-plasma ’ becomes trapped? In the plasma- sphere?\" \"This is correct.\" \"And it is there that it blends with (or joins) all of the other soul-entities or, I should say, with all of the plasmic-souls ?\" \"As of the Earth, it gives back to the Earth,\" he intoned. \"So, when the soul-spirit leaves the body and goes into the magnetosphere (into this"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":" 150 magnetic bottle) it becomes trapped - along with all of the other plasma - in the magnetosphere. It is able to re-incarnate back to Earth, but it cannot go any farther afield. In short, it cannot escape beyond the outer edge of the Earth's magnetic field. Is this correct?\" \"This is correct until the process (is complete) and the soul-spirit has been refined sufficiently to release it from all attachment to that which you call the 'substance' (plasma).\" \"What if the magnetic 'bottle' were to start to collapse during the Earth's magnetic polarity reversal?\" I asked, \"What will happen to all of the soul-spirits - the plasmic body of souls - who are currently trapped within it?\" \"Those that are of the understanding - and no longer need to be trapped within the Earth - will come home,\" he responded. \"Then these are the 'gates' - the 'Gateways' - you have been talking about. Is that right?\" \"This is one of the understandings of the 'Gateways',\" he replied. \"When we first communicated with you, we assured you - over and over - that none would be lost who chose to come. None would be lost who chose to remain.

Did this take place towards the end of the last Magnetic Pole Reversal?\" \"This is correct.\" He replied. \"Then may we sum up by saying that the soul-spirits can escape and return from whence they came?\" I asked. \"Those who wish to escape,\" he corrected \"those who wish may return to their Source.\" \"How long, in our Earth time, will it take for th is magnetic reversal to occur?

I decided to go along with him regarding the belief that the combined 'minds within the Earth' will determine the length of time it will take for the magnetic pole reversal to do its thing, even though I, personally, find it very difficult to accept. I told him so. \"I find this difficult to accept because I believe the polar reversal to be a natural physical phenomenon that will occur regardless of any po ssible influence by collective 'minds'.\" \"It is 'physical' just as your body is 'physica l'. That which controls your body controls, also, that which happens to the Earth. ” He said. \"You have, indeed, grasped the understanding of the entrapment. We would offer you that the entrapm ent by the (magneto-spheric) belt so described, acts like a barrier, and that which hits the barrier, comes back again to Earth. It is a constant ongoing process, therefore we - who come to assist - constantly ask you to inform others of the Like-Mind that the changes will not be so severe , and will be handled by Earth and its peoples therein. \"You have seen and witnessed demonstrations such as this, and your mind participated in destructing that which it was given to do,\" he said, referring, no doubt, to ancient experiences we had shared together, but of which I have absolutely no recall.

Fear and hysteria! A mind not controlled is a mind of energy uselessly bonded,\" he said. \"Once again I ’ m confused,\" I told him. \"If you can understand the meaning of 'fear' and 'hysteria' in the entrapped Souls, then why couldn' t you understand the fear within Man when I tried to explain it to you?\" \"We still do not comprehend the fear-factor as you have described it. We observe what happens to the mind-energy and still we do not understand. Had we understood, we could have controlled and assisted in a more positive way,\" he explained. \"So you are telling me that the 'fear' experienc ed by man in his physical body is completely separate from the fear and hysteria he experiences with his mind?\" \"Mind uncontrolled,\" he corrected me. \"Then who, or what, controls the mind when it is out of the body?\" \"There are governing forces,\" he replied. \"We cons tantly tell you of the link to the Source.\" \"Yes, you do.\" \"When the link is ruptured or misplaced in an 'essence', it is like your communication systems when they are not tuned.\" \"Are you saying that the 'Silver Chord' can become ruptured or broken?\" I asked. \"This would be a way of understanding.\" \"Then yes, I understand, ” I told him. “ Now, with the exception of determining the time it will take to complete a Magnetic Reversal.. let's sum up what I have learned. . . \" \"We would offer you, two-zero-zero-four (2004) ,\" he interjected.

If you check that which are your old records, y ou will find that this communication was given.\" Monitor was referring to a communication I had received during the sessions which led to the first book, ‘ The Skull Speaks ’ . I acknowledged what he was telling me. I went on to explain that the Ozone Layer was not specifically mentioned, and at the time I had first learned about it I hadn't fully understood the magnitude of the destruc tion. Neither had I at that time understood the truth behind the phenomenon of physical destruction of the magnetosphere by radio and other electromagnetic transmissions. \"It is only now after having done considerable research into what has taken place that I realize the extent of the damage that has been done to both our fragile outer envelope, and to the various belts and spheres lying within the magnetosphere,\" I told him."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":" 154 This destruction is largely due to the indiscriminate use of atmospheric nuclear detonations, the effects of which have lasted for years. \"In addition,\" I informed him, \"there are the damaging effects upon our upper and outer atmospheres created by rocket propulsion systems and their particle acceleration as man reaches out into space. It is these man-made devices and experiments that are destroying our total Earth- shield systems.\" \"And, indeed,\" Monitor added, \"you have placed objects of war and destruction within the atmosphere.\" I wasn't one hundred percent sure that what he was saying was true. We knew of the earlier testings of nuclear bombs in the atmosphere, but I wasn't sure this was what Monitor was talking about. Because of this uncertainty, I decided to give the subject a break and move onto something else. \"You have used the term 'vibration', many, many times over the course of these communications, ” I told him. “ Would you define its exact meaning for me? I know you have already covered this, but I would like a clearer understanding of its meaning.\" \"Vibration? As applied to what?\" He asked. \"To the highest possible levels,\" I replied. \"The highest vibration being, that which is not.\" \"Is this the level I have referred to as 'fv (Hz) x+ ?\" I asked. \"This is correct.\" \"Thank you. You have mentioned the term 'Univers al Light'. Would you define this for me, please?\" \"This is our way of explaining to you that which is an Intelligence',\" he replied. \"I understand.\""},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":" 155 \"An 'intelligence' encased, is an 'Intelligence',\" he explained. \"And 'Universal Intelligence'. What is that?\" I asked. \"Which can also be called 'energy' that is then refined.\" \"Such as my earlier ‘ pure-white-light-shining-through-a prism ’ analogy?\" I asked. \"This is correct.\" \"When I asked you how you overcome the forces of gravity, you answered that you 'bent' the spectrum of light by changing its frequency. . . \" \"And also that of sound,\" he interjected. \"Our craft take what you would understand as your base metals , and from each of them, we extrac t the atomic particle (that which is excited) and then we overcome that which you know as 'gravity'. \"This is not done by the propulsion systems the wa y it is done on Earth. However, there are, within the Earth at this time - at this date -.three (people) who are very close to offering your scientific world that which is similar. But it is still a very crude form of this scientific procedure. \"We have tried to contain as much as possi ble your expanding upon this knowledge since it is still within the mind of the Gross-Beings to use such knowledge for the control of mankind,\" he said. \"I can understand this,\" I told him. \"The three people you speak of - these three scientists or engineers - are they of the Like-Mind or are they G-B ’ s?\" \"There are two who are of the Like-Mind', ” he replied, “ The other would seek to gain. However, this one, also, has been diverted,\" he replied. As we were on the subject of Like-Minds I was reminded of the name of the Professor of Psychics given by to me by Monitor in a previ ous session. I asked if he was an L-MP?. Monitor confirmed that he was a ‘ person whose mind registers with the resonance of our understanding.' He also added that he was also of 'like-mind' and very approachable. \"You will be helpful to him since you will re-awaken his heritage. He is of The Seven,\" he"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":" 156 said, meaning, of course, that he was also originally from the Pleiades or, as it is sometimes called, the constellation of the 'Seven Sisters'. I thanked him for the information and informed him that I had already taken steps to reach this person through contacts I had at the local University. I next asked whether or not the linking together of the magnetic field and the entrapment of our Soul-spirits had been raised before that day. It was, I admit, a question designed to determine if my discovery of it was new, or whether it had already been discovered by someone else. I need not have been concerned. \"When you say 'revealed', you must understand that this information is yours. It is not a 'revealing'. . . it is, an unlocking. You already had this understanding,\" he explained. \"I realize I must be careful with whom I share this information,\" I told him, meaning, of course, the information that was coming both directly from Monitor (through Carole) plus the information that was being fed directly into my own mind. \"This is affirmative,\" he acknowledged. \"We hav e - as in the past - informed you of your position within the Universal Law. We would reaffi rm that this is your mission. . . and was your mission. You have come to the understanding now. \"We have monitored you through many incarnati ons. You are not revealing. . . you are not collecting new information. . . you are unlocking the mind to that which you already know.\" His voice was sombre as he spoke. \"I understand this,\" I told him. \"But there are many G-B ’ s who could mis-use it.\" \"This is correct,\" he said. \"However, when a Gross Being would try (to use) this, he would get only to a certain point before his understanding would cease to exist. \"We will offer you more (information) on the 'S oul-Magnetic-Field'. We will tell you that you will devise - with another instrument of measuring - a way of measuring this field. And then you will understand just how the magnetic field is within t he Earth and within the human being. . . and how it"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":" 157 is that diseases can be controlled - or used - as it is now being used as an element of control of the vast masses,\" he said. I didn ’ t fully understand what he meant by this but assumed - as has happened many times before - that a better understanding would come later when I least expected it. I let it go and moved on to another topic. I was anxious to get back to the question of the pole reversals. Monitor had given the year 2004 as the time when the precursory events would begin that would warn us of an impending magnetic pole reversal, but he had not as yet given the crucial time-estimate of the duration of the total magnetic field collapse. I needed to know the length of time the dimensional gates would remain aligned and open. I went on to explain exactly why it was we needed to know this as precisely as possible, and how important I thought it was for the people of the world to know. \"The reason we need to know this is quite simple,\" I explained. \"During this period of collapse our magnetic field will be shut down to zero , leaving us completely vulnerable to cosmic radiation, solar radiation and sun-flare activity - plus the violent magnetic storms that will inevitably bombard the surface of our planet with radio-active particles and other materials carried by the Solar winds. This will devastate many life-forms on our planet. We must have this information now - as soon as possible - if lives are to be saved when it occurs,\" I said, with as much urgency as I could muster in voice. \"You are not taking into account that - once the Gates are fully opened - there will be much help from other Star Systems as well as your ow n,\" he said calmly. \"We will, in fact, be present upon the Earth. . . offering and showing you the ways of protecting the Earth from the elements.\" This was somewhat reassuring to know that some form of help was on the way, but it still didn ’ t give me the answer I was looking for. \"I appreciate what you are saying, but I think the 'Noah's Ark' analogy might be useful here."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":" 158 We need to know - well ahead of time - whether the dur ation of this collapse w ill be for six or twelve months. . . five years. . . ten years. . . or however long it is going to be, so that we can prepare now to save lives; stockpile for the future, and find the safety areas in which to build shelters. . . 'sanctuaries'. . . and whatever else may be needed by the Like-Minds.\" Monitor listened patiently to what I had to say, then, when I had finished, he replied in a very soft voice. \"We have also instructed you that this is not within our control,\" he said. \"It is within yours.\" \"The answers lie more within your capabilities than mine,\" I informed him. \"You have memory of the last time the magnetic field collapsed and of the souls being trapped. Right now, in this life-time, I have no memory of this event at all. Can't you recall how long that period lasted?\" \"This - that you will undergo at this time - is not of the same character as before. You are not taking into consideration all that we are giving you. . .such as the interference of the New Planet that is coming close to the Earth. \"We have told you that if you use all of the information that we have given you, that the changes will not be as severe as you believe them to be. Also, help will be readily available.\" He paused as if weighing over what more he must tell me to get the message across as succinctly as possible. \"You ask us to predict a time - as you know time - and yet you are the governing factor. You, and the minds of all Like-Minded people, are the governing factor as to the physical changes that will take place upon the Earth, and as to how long these changes will last. \"If you do not inform them - and the Like-Minds do not act to cease the destruction within and without your planet - then the destruction of Earth will be great and help will be of a very insignificant amount. We have also informed you that there are ways in which the Like-Minds will make 'higher' the vibration of the Earth, thus making the planet itself - and its structure within - vibrate at a higher frequency, and therefore, the density of the actual structure of the planet Earth"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":" 159 will not be as great - and the magnetic field, and the changes upon the mass - will not be so severe. ” \"How can we inform you more? You ask us to give you the time. We ask you to give us the time.\" Once again, he had sidestepped the issue and avoided giving me the length of time the reversal process might take to complete its cycle. I thought I'd try one more tack by using the Sun and other planets in our solar system as examples. \"Our Sun goes through a full magnetic polarity reversal approximately every twenty two years. Also, we can assume that some of the other planets in our system have periodic polarity reversals. . . Mercury. . . Jupiter. . . Saturn. . . Uranus and, maybe, others?\" \"Then you are questioning 'when is the alignment'?\" \"No. I ’ m asking you how long will the Gate remain open?\" \"The Gate will remain open for many of your Earth years,\" he replied, \"but the negative effects upon it will be in your control. This will be ei ther of a negative or positive force. . . the control is in the minds of those upon Earth.\" I confess that in my ignorance of the fundamental forces that lie beyond the realm of our physical reality, I was becoming somewhat testy at this seeming avoidance of the simple question I had repeatedly asked him. For some reason, Monitor's continual reference to our 'minds' being able to control any of the natural, physical proce sses within the Universe seemed so completely outrageous and ridiculous to me . It smacked mo re like the hocus-pocus-gibberish expounded by so many New Age cult-followers, that it was beginning to destroy the credibility of everything else he had been telling me. I expressed my feelings in a far from patient manner and concluded my remarks by saying: \"All I ’ m asking you is this: How long will the switching process take before the 'Bottle- Shield' is returned to help protect the Earth from solar and cosmic radiation - and just how long will"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":" 160 the Gates remain open?\" I asked, then added, \"Frankly, I cannot believe that the duration of this process can possibly have anything to do with the minds of the people on Earth. This is a physical phenomenon. Period!\" \"Then,\" he said, quietly and patiently, \"Your understanding is not yet open to this knowledge.\" \"Even in my wildest periods of fantasy, I cannot see where the collective minds of Earth people can affect a natural physical process as enormous as this,\" I told him. \"Our planet - along with all the other planets in our solar-system - orbit our Sun in a relatively fixed period of time. Magnetic reversals occur periodically, and our Sun continues to influence all aspects of our behaviour. This is a natural, physical process,\" I expl ained as patiently as I could. \"Why do I seem to have so much difficulty in extracting an answer from you regarding the length of time that our Earth's magnetic shield will remain shut down?\" \"We would offer you this. The destruction that plagues your planet - that of your War Machines - changes the speed and the vibration of the planet Earth. Each time it is in action - whether it be to a great degree or a small degree - it alters the Earth's vibration. Therefore we cannot predict for you when, exactly - in your timing - this alignment will take place. \"That which you explode deep within the Earth changes the vibration of the Earth and the speed - the magnetic pull - and the structure. It is, ther efore, very likely that you - in your intuitive understanding - would be able to 'feel' for the Earth and give an estimated time.\" Again he had turned the tables on me! He had once more left it up to me - or to other like- minded people - to figure out just how long our planet will remain un-shielded once the magnetic reversal begins, and the field collapses. Intuition ’ is one thing, but it would need a great deal more data from people knowledgeable in Geo-magnet ic and Magneto-spheric phenomena before any of us would be able to arrive at even a remote guesstimate. I am hopeful that other Like-Minds - with information and expertise far in excess of mine - will come forward to help. Monitor continued."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":" 161 \"You must realize that, in years before, this Earth was not bombarded with that which is now - such as your bombs and your microwaves - and that which you use so indiscriminately outside the atmosphere (fluoro-carbons, etc.) and within.\" \"I understand this,\" I responded, \"and I totally accept what you are saying.\" \"The core of the Earth. . . the structure. . . is being altered so greatly that you now have a reversal of the inner core of your Earth,\" he said . \"You do not understand that the very Earth itself is also, as you would term it, (made up of) 'bands'. . . 'layers'. That which is outside, is also within.\" I interpreted this 'inner core reversal' to mean an increase in turbulence within the magma, not a magnetic reversal emanating from the liquid metal core. However, what Monitor was saying - about the indiscriminate detonating of underground and atmospheric nuclear explosions affecting our planet and atmosphere - is 100% valid. The Russi ans, Americans, British, Chinese, East Indian and Pakistani governments - along with several other Nations - have done a considerable amount of damage by carrying on totally unnecessary underground testing of hydrogen bombs, while the French - seemingly totally blind and oblivious to t he destruction they are c ausing to the sea-life and other life-forms around the South Pacific - have callously carried out their atmospheric testing of nuclear weaponry despite pleas by the United Nation and Pacific rim countries to refrain from doing it.. There seems to be no end to the complete stupidity of mankind - most especially those in power. And why are they doing it? To what purpose? Dominance over others. . . the prime directive shared by the grossest of all Gross-Beings. I began to skip from one subject to another as I sought to gain additional information on subject matter we had already broached in past sessions. During one of these conversations, Monitor had hinted that some people might be able to observe physical matter - where it seemingly doesn' t exist - by using one's 'peripheral vision'. I queried him about this."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":" 162 \"I know what 'peripheral vision' means in an Earthly sense,\" I told him, \"but what, exactly, do you mean by it?\" \"Vision that is mind-related and affects the eyes and the body,\" he replied. \"So you are not talking about 'side vision ’ - that which can be seen at the outer periphery of our vision in the physical sense - are you?\" \"It can be explained that way,\" he replied. \"However, this is a very arduous way.\" \"I was wondering if you have another, possibly deeper, meaning. You are talking more about the 'mind' than about actual physical vision, aren ’ t you?\" \"We have observed,\" he replied. \"We see, and will place in this mind (Carole's) an observation that will be given to you for bending the li ght you perceive, therefore making that which is so-called 'unseen', more easily seen.\" That was all he had to say about that particular subject so I moved onto the next. \"When you use the term 'Universe', we generally take it to mean the entire Universe. . . the entire cosmos in the Third dimension. However, you have sometimes referred to 'many universes'. Is it possible that there is some degree of confusion in translating this through the mind you are currently using?\" I asked him. \"Is it possibl e you mean 'Galaxies' instead of Universes?\" \"No,\" he said flatly. \"There are other Universes as well as other Galaxies. That which is closest to 'The Seven' (The Pleiades) is the Dial Universe. It is also a governing body that takes into itself the planet Earth.\" \"You define many Universes within the structure of the Third dimension. Is this correct?\" I asked. \"This is correct,\" he replied. \"You have also used a phrase - when referring to your craft's ability to pass from one dimension to another - as 'dilation around the ship'. Would you define what you mean by the word"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":" 163 'dilation'?\" \"This would be a term understood by you in relation to 'time',\" he replied. \"You are referring to time dilation?\" I asked. \"As outlined in Einstein's 'Special Theory of Relativity'?\" Monitor acknowledged that this was, indeed, what he meant. He was, of course, referring to Einstein's theory in which he states that every observer will determine his own time measurement within his own frame of reference. For the benefit of those who may not be familiar with this 'time dilation' theory, a very rudimentary explanation would have two Observers - each with a highly accurate watch or timepiece set at exactly the same time - standing together beside a rocket launch pad in a Space- Rocket Centre on Earth. As Observer 'A' climbs aboard a rocket that can travel at 90% the speed of light, he is given instructions to report back to Observer ‘ B ’ at Ground Control in exactly 6 hours after blast off. The rocket leaves at exactly 12 o'clock noon and accelerates swiftly to 90% the speed of light while Observer ‘ A ’ carefully monitors his timepiece waiting until it is time to call base. At exactly 18.00 hours by his watch , he places a call back to base and asks to speak to Observer ‘ B ’ . To his consternation, an unfamiliar voice at Ground Control tells him that Observer ‘ B ’ is no longer there - that he had retired years ago and is now a very old man living in a home for the aged! How could this have possibly happened? The answer is simple: Time dilation! In the six hours that had passed - according to the timepiece aboard the rocket - Observer B and everyone else back at Ground Control had aged 48.75 years ! This is the relativistic phenomenon Monitor is referring to when he warns us of 'dilation around a ship'. * - * - * -"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":" 164 XVI =========================================================== MORE ON MATTER, PLASMA, REVERSALS & CHANGES At the time of this writing the Big Bang theorists were having a field day, little knowing that the theory is flawed, and the cracks in it will eventually split the hypothesis apart. As discussed in Chapter Two, if matter can be created through an endless number of rips and tears between two dimensions (positive & negative converter points) , then it is also probable that a constant state of creation exists all around us. I decided to pose this theory to Monitor to test his reaction. \"Is it possible,\" I asked, \"that a 'converter point ' (where the EPE is transformed into plasma or matter) could exist right here - in this room - if vibrational levels were changed?\" \"Yes, this is a possibility,\" he assured me. \"And matter could be both created and disintegrated within this room - allowing for the potential for both positive converter points (+CP ’ s) and negative converter points ( -CP ’ s i.e. Mini-Black Holes) - to exist as well?\" \"This also is a possibility,\" he said. I suddenly had a mental image of plasma being cr eated out of the 'nothing-ness' around us allowing the manifestation of something ethereal. \"How is a poltergeist created? Can you describe the type of vibration that might be required to manifest a poltergeist within this room - and who, or what, would be needed to generate the energy to produce such a phenomenon? ” I asked, beginning to link the poltergeist phen- omenon with the ‘ creation ’ of plasma in my mind."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":" 165 \"It would require the energy of one who vibrates at a slightly different level than the norm, ” he replied. \"The energy would be taken from all within the room. ” \"This manifestation is a substance that can be measured and seen in the Third dimension and yet it is also there, unseen by the eyes and the body,\" he explained. \"The personality that no longer inhabits the body is able to pick up the frequency from the mind of the individual it is operating towards. It will then take the energy of each and everyone around, and then make a manifestation of some kind within the area.\" \"By 'manifestation, do you mean a sort of 'plasmatic' manifestation?\" \"Yes, or an unseen manifestation - or the product of a manifestation - such as the disturbance of Third dimensional space.\" \"You are talking about a 'force field'?\" I asked. \"This is correct.\" \"Is this a magnetic force field?\" \"The 'magnetic' is incorrect. It is a force field of non-magnetic structure,\" he replied. \"You are saying, then, that it is a non-magnetic structure developed by one person within a room, who, in turn, draws additional energy from ot her people in the room in order to manifest a poltergeist. Is this correct?\" I asked. \"This can be done,\" he replied. \"Then isn't this, in its own way, a means of creating plasma - the same way matter is created?\" \"There has to be a form of plasma before plasma can join,\" he replied. \"If there is no conductor, there cannot be a receiver. Matter is not the same . Matter can be the product of the energy of thought.\" \"It is said that plasma is the 'fourth state' of matter,\" I reminded him. \"It is the stage that energy - the Essence of Pure Energy ( EPE) - must go through to become matter. Is this correct?\""},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":" 166 \"This is a state. However, it is not completely correct.\" \"Would you explain, please?\" \"There has to be plasma for plasma to expand,\" he explained. \"But the plasma is an ethereal body, is it not?\" \"This is not correct. Ectoplasm and plasma are one and the same. This is not etheric. The etheric is a manifestation - a vibration - of light.\" \"And that is matter?\" \"This can be termed 'matter', yes.\" He paused before continuing. \"Ectoplasm is a dense substance,\" he stated, possibly referring to the almost viscous ‘ substance ’ that is often reported to ooze out of the mouths of some psychic mediums during trance sessions. \"But there is no measure of density to it, is there?\" I asked. \"It can be measured.\" \"At a vibrational level?\" \"At a level where one would normally measure density,\" he responded. \"Is it a 'gaseous' substance?\" I asked. \"It contains animal, vegetable, and mineral.\" \"Is it made up of atoms? Ions?\" \"It is both. It is a product of body structure.\" \"And can be drawn from those in the immediate area?\" \"This is correct,\" he replied. \"Is this 'substance' in any way similar to that of the so called, 'Silver Cord' that is supposed to connect the ethereal to the physical body during OBE's (Out of Body Experience)? Does this cord have any substance at all?\" \"This is a substance of a different nature,\" he replied. \"At the moment of physical death, would this form of plasma leave the body?\" I asked."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":" 167 \"Plasma stays with the body,\" he replied. \"Even after death?\" \"Even after death.\" \"Yet when the soul leaves the body at the time of death, it has been reported that there is a sudden - measurable - decrease in the weight of the body,\" I told him. \"This is the ‘ etheric ’ ,\" Monitor responded. \"Then, by deduction, we must assume the etheric body - the soul-spirit - has weight. Is this correct?\" \"An etheric can be measured,\" he stated. \"And does have substance?\" \"And can have substance,\" he replied. This is a rather interesting subject which, I believe, is closely related to the sleep phases we go through. It is my belief that a part of this 'ethereal-substance' leaves the physical body while we are in the sleep-state. But does it always return to the body the exact same moment we wake up? I am one of those weight-conscious individual s who religiously steps on the scales each and every morning in order to monitor my bulk. A nd, over the years, I have noticed a remarkable phenomenon that seems to occur within the first ten to fifteen minutes of wakefulness: I gain weight! The amount I gain is somewhere around 1/8 to 1/4 a pound each time. Not a large amount, to be sure, but definitely a measurable increase in weight. And no, I neither drink nor ingest anything at all during this period. In fact, to put it delicately, the opposite is most often true ! What then, is the cause of this weight gain after I arise from sleep? Can it have anything to do with some unknown form of interaction between body molecules and gravity? Or is it, perhaps, the etheric substance Monitor has spoken of, gradually returning (from god-only-knows-where) back into my now awakened body? Frankly, I don't have any answers but I will make a point of"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":" 168 asking Monitor about it in the future. In the meantime, try this experiment for yourse lf. Walk, stagger, or run straight from your bed as soon after awakening as possible. Go first to your scales and check (as closely as you can on bathroom scales) how much you weigh. Next, go about your usual business - answer all calls to Nature, etc., but don't eat or drink anything for at least ten to fifteen minutes from the time you weighed in. When time is up, step back on your scales and check your weight again and see if you have lost or gained. Well? Where did that extra weight come from? - * - * - * - For some a number of years, I had been intrigued with the potential benefits to the world offered by the development and use of ' superconductors' - those exotic materials that are able to carry (conduct) electromagnetic charges with a minimum amount of resistance - and the relationship between temperature and molecular activity in a number of other materials. At a temperature of absolute zero -275.15 Celsius (Zero degrees Kelvin) there are a number of different materials in which all resistance to electromagnetic forces ceases . In such cases an electrical charge can - theoretically - continue to flow around and around a closed circuit forever in a state we know as ‘ perpetual motion ’ . This can only happen when the molecular activity - within the material itself - ceases completely leaving an uninterrupted pathway through which a charge can flow. In other words, when all of the atoms in the material lie in a state of suspended animation they will offer absolute zero resistance to a charge. It was this aspect of the phenomenon that intrigued me the most, for in it, I envisioned a 'sea of tranquillity' where neither chaos nor turmoil exists . . .a state of absolute and total bliss - a state where the vibrational levels of all physical things would be at zero. If this were so, I wondered, then should we not be seeking lower vibrational levels rather"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":" 169 than higher ones? I was beginning to see a condition of zero-movement, a serene, placid and peaceful state in which a Soul would exist forever. I described this to Monitor and asked him what such a state of existence really is. \"One-ness,\" he answered. \"You are saying it is a state of 'one-ness', where nothing disturbs the whole?\" I asked. \"This is correct. There is no need for movement, for (in such a state) intelligence and understanding becomes 'ALL' in its purest form.\" \"As far as vibrational levels are concerned, they would be at a level below zero, ” I suggested. ” . . . that is zero minus one.\" \"Vibration and frequency,\" he said, placing emphasis on the 'and'. \"They are different,\" I agreed. \"You look for a way to measure when we would offer you 'feeling '.\" \"A state of limbo is a state between states. It is a state of nothingness. Is this correct?\" \"We do not recognize (what you are saying),\" he responded. \"A state of suspended animation - suspended in time and space - where everything ceases to move.\" \"Time and space?\" He queried \"Cease to be,\" I replied. \"Time and space, become as One,\" he said flatly. My mind sought to find another avenue along which to pursue this line of reasoning and it suddenly dawned on me that, if zero degrees Kelvin were Nirvana, then the antonym to such paradisiacal 'heaven' could very well be the fiery furnace of Hell. \"What, exactly, is 'Hell'?\" I asked. \"It is a state of 'non-being', is it not?\" \"It is a state of confusion-of-mind and of intelligence,\" he replied. \"Hell - in our Christian religions - is depicted as a very hot inferno where 'sinners' are"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":" 170 doomed to spend an eternity as a punishment for their transgressions. It seems to be the exact opposite to the state of Absolute Zero K we've just been talking about,\" I explained. \"From whence our Christian fathers developed this concept, I have no idea. Perhaps you could elaborate on this belief system?\" \"When the mind and the body and the intelligence is in a state of chaos, you will find that there is a generation of heat,\" he replied. \"The opposite would be as you have described as very cold. ” \"When the mind or consciousness is in a state of confusion - even though the body be disintegrated (as in death) - consciousness will manifest in the Third dimension for disruptive purposes,\" he explained. \"Our Poltergeist, for example?\" \"Affirmative,\" he responded. \"You will notice that when this manifestation is present, your temperature drops rapidly as the 'personality' draws all that you know as 'heat' to within itself. This is how it is able to manifest.\" This, of course, explains why some people have reported feeling sudden drops in temperature around them when in the presence of 'ghosts ’ or poltergeists. It did not, however, resolve or answer my questions regarding absolute Zero and a state of Nirvana. However, as Carole was tiring after the longer than usual session, I resolved to bring it to a close and possibly raise the issue again at a later time. - * - * - * - A constant theme attributable to The Monitors is the safety and protection of planet Earth. I am fully aware that much of the material in this book is somewhat repetitive, but I have learned from experience that hidden within such repetition there often lie many bits of information which,"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":" 171 when combined together, add up to a substantial amount of extra interrelated bits of highly important material. As pointed out in Chapter VII, the words of conveyance employed by Monitor to penetrate the consciousness of our minds will invariably mean diffe rent things to different readers. It is for this reason that I have deliberately kept in some of the repetitive material - hoping that some of you like-minds may well garner a broader spectrum of intelligence from it than I have managed to retrieve. Monitor's following explanation may be of further help to you. \"To offer further guidance of the Earth and the Gates, we have examined a 'globe' within a 'globe' within a 'globe', and from there (within such a place) there would be points of perfect alignment. . . perfect field alignments. \"When that which was outside aligns perfectly with that which is inside . . .upon it . . .and through it . . .a state of perfection would exist, for the magnetic fields would all be in perfect alignment. Therefore, the 'Gates' would be open. \"First of all, ” he continued, “ When the total collapse of the planet (that which was close to Earth) took place, it shifted the Gates from without and this caused great havoc upon the Earth.\" I assumed he was talking about the magnetic field collapse of Earth ’ s companion planet, and was now relating the alignment of both the Earth's, and other planet's magnetospheres, as having been - at one time - balanced in a state of perfection. From what he was telling us, I assumed it was the magnetic polarity reversal of Earth ’ s sister planet that caused it to collapse, causing its ‘ gates ’ to fall out of alignment with those of Earth. At the time of that session I had guessed that the last magnetic-polarity reversal probably happened somewhere between 500,000 and 800,000 years ago. However, I did not believe he was alluding to anything as recent as the so-called sinking of Atlantis, but rather, he was possibly referring to the extinction of other life-forms on Earth."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":" 172 \"That which man is doing to this planet is causing much misalignment within the Earth,\" he said. \"If the Earth were to align perfectly with that which was previously without (the sister planet), you would have no fear of the destruction or harm that will be done to Earth. For where there is perfection, there are also ‘ intelligences ’ and barriers that you do not know exist. These would come into play and protect the Earth. \"However, the state of perfection that you seek will only come after the 'cleansing' of the Earth and the Earth's people.\" He paused for a long moment before going on. \"Earth has to cleanse from within, therefore great eruptions will occur upon the face of the Earth as it attempts to align itself with that which is without. Each of the barriers within the Earth vibrates at its own frequency, has its own field, and has its own life-sustenance, as you would term it. \"This, though not understood by Earth's people, will be understood by yourself and Like- Minds, for there are many forms of life and intelligence. That which has gone before you is pressed into the Earth. The intelligence factor remain s within the Earth and is used as a vibration to pacify the planet. \"The barriers which you have perceived in your hi story are not as correct as your scientists would have you believe,\" he said, referring to the magnetic field-shield. \"Therefore we again offer you that that which you fear can be offset, for other barriers can come into place to protect Earth. And if Like-Minds are open to the information we shall give to you, then this will take place.\" There was a very long pause as, once again, he seemed to be consulting with his peers. \"There will be a way of re-arranging matter that will be given to that which is of Earth's mind and Like-Minds. If used correctly, this will protect the Earth.\" I suggested that it had better happen quickly as we seem to be running out of time. His response was a touch whimsical. \"Are we running out of - or into - Time?\" He asked."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":" 173 \" Whichever way, we still need time to do all that must be done. It is not enough just to have answers at our fingertips,\" I told him. “ We must have time to develop, produce and test whatever safeguards or procedures may be necessary.\" \"Even with that which you know as 'sound waves' you can protect the Earth from much,\" he said. For some reason or other, such a suggestion seemed totally ridiculous at the time. Frankly, I thought it was Carole suddenly interjecting her own thoughts into the communication and that in some perverse way Monitor was trying to test both my intelligence and credulity. I gave vent to my feelings of disbelief. \"I don't for one minute believe the Earth can be protected from a bombardment of X-rays, gamma rays, charged particles or the violent flare activity and magnetic storms carried by the solar winds by ‘ sound waves ’ . . . Monitor cut in abruptly. \"There is a way.\" \"But we are talking about an incredibly vast field of energy and radiation that is about to strike this planet the moment our magnetic field-shield collapses.\" \"It is vast in your ways of thinking,\" he explained patiently, \"But you must understand that your ways are still in their infancy.\" It was the classic put-down, and I should have conceded the point right there, but my hackles were up and I felt I still had a valid argument to make regarding mind over matter. \"If our ways are still in their infancy,\" I bridled, \"then we are in very big trouble. This magnetic polarity reversal will hit us within ten. . . possibly fifteen . . . years from now (1989) and, unless we do something about preparing for it right now, we really are in trouble. We have too much to learn and too little time in which to learn it all.\" \"You talk of learning?\" He asked, a hint of surprise in the inflection of his voice. \"Again we emphasize it is not 'learning' it is an awakening! A magnetic shield around the Earth is not an"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":" 174 impossibility. There are many times when our craft alter the magnetics of the Earth, as you have witnessed. This could be done -and will be done - yet again.\" \"I would like to feel re-assured,\" I told him, \"but. . . ?\" I left the sentence in midair. My 'Irish' had subsided and I was now back in control of the semi-domesticated 'wild bronco' that is a part of my own gross-self. \"Then we urge you to do your part,\" he said. \"I ’ m trying to, but a part of my job is to fully understand that which I must pass onto others. Only then can I intelligently inform other people of the many, many things you are telling me. Monitor was quiet for a long while and, to make sure he was still there, I continued. \"When I pose the same sort of questions over and over again, it is because I often lack either the full understanding or meaning of what you ’ re saying.\" \"We see within your mind an awakening,\" he returned. \"We also sense your Earth urgency and, for which, we have understanding. \"You have voiced concern, and correctly so, in the information that is now given by us as an awak ening in you. Therefore we must proceed with great caution with this mind - and like-minds - or we will find that those of the Gross-Beings will, indeed, seek to destroy again.\" \"This is also my concern,\" I told him. \"I must first obtain the information, make sure it is as accurate as possible, then pass it on to those Li ke-Minds who will be able to do something concrete about it.\" \"The magnetic shield for protecting Earth - for which you, in part, will be responsible - will have a great deal to do with that which you call your Moon,\" he said. This time I bit my tongue, for no matter how far-out Monitor's information may sound, he was still the teacher who knew more than I could ever hope to know in a thousand lifetimes. If you will recall, Monitor had earlier claimed our Moon was in some way protecting the"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":" 175 Earth. This new reference to its possible future use as a means of shielding our planet was obviously a continuation of a theme which, I felt sure, he would develop when the time was right. In order to assure myself the information I was now receiving matched earlier data, I again questioned him about the 'sister-planet' to Earth he had previously spoken about. \"This companion planet to Earth - the one you said had been destroyed - can you give me an idea as to the size and density of it in relation to Earth?\" \"We have previously given you th is information,\" he replied. \"You said it was a tad smaller than the Earth. Is this correct?\" \"It was half... ” he stopped in mid sentence before correcting himself, “ It was one and a half times. . . \" \"The size of the Earth?\" I interjected. \"This is the density,\" he replied, giving the same information as before. \"And the atmosphere on this planet? What was it like?\" \"In which regard?\" \"Was it the same - or similar - to Earth's? Can you give me some idea of the chemical make up of it?\" \"There is much information already dissemi nated. You will travel. You will find this information,\" he replied. \"You mean you can't give it to me?\" \"The information that you require to print must be verified,\" he stated. \"Therefore it is to your advantage to print it so the scientific world may give credence to it. Should we give you the information we have - and such information were to change that which they have - there would be a great deal of scepticism among those to whom this word must reach.\" He was quiet for a few moments as if considering what to say next. Then he continued. \"However, we will liken it much to your Moon. . . and yet. . . \""},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":" 176 \"Our moon? When? At what time in the past?\" I asked. \"As your Moon is known to science in this day. . . in this time.\" He replied. \"Therefore it had no atmosphere. Is that what you're saying?\" He then gave me some important information that he felt was not appropriate to put into print at this time. I respect his wishes and have omitted it here, but at a future time, I promise, it will be revealed to those Like-Minds who will know how to use it. We next moved on to other aspects of our Earth's former ‘ companion ’ planet. \"From whence came this planet? Was it born in our Solar system or did it come from beyond?\" \"It was travelling, also, within your Solar system at the time of Earth,\" he replied. \"But not in the same general orbit as Earth. Correct?\" \"It was not in the same orbit as Earth,\" he stated. \"When it did come close to Earth, and what caused it to either break up, disintegrate or move?\" \"The structure of the vibrational change. Again, it was fragmented from within.\" \"Did it have a magnetic field?\" \"All bodies have magnetic fields,\" he stated. \"But not all planets have magnetic fields similar to our Earth's dynamo core-generated ones,\" I reminded him. \"Some have very weak, very limited, fields. A few are self-generated while still others are primarily generated through interaction between the Solar wind with the atmospheric boundaries of the planet itself. Others probably have none.\" \"Again we must advise you that your understandi ng of magnetics and magnetic fields is very limited,\" he said. \"I won ’ t disagree with you,\" I told him. \"My knowledge is very limited - period!\""},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":" 177 At the time this session was taking place most of my textbooks were quite out of date regarding planetary magnetic fields and - as a result - much of my research had necessitated ploughing through many Astronomical periodicals, magazines, National Geographic Society publications, and newspaper clippings to bring me reasonably up-to-date with the published findings. The remarkable discoveries of the various fields surrounding Saturn, Jupiter and Uranus made by Voyager 2 had gradually unfolded a weal th of startling information about our Solar system and planetary interactions with our Sun. At that time, Voyager 2 was hurtling through space en route for its rendezvous with Neptune where, I should point out, it was to discover yet another planet with a magnetic field, fine-particle rings, moons, and of course, its own remarkable moon, Triton. Monitor was, as usual, 100% correct. My knowledge is extremely limited as far as the field of magnetics is concerned, but then, even the knowledge of our scientists - those who specialize in the field of the magnetosphere in general - is also limited. Each year brings new findings, and every new discovery pertaining to the interactive forces within and beyond our Solar system is causing old paradigms and dogma to be replaced with new. Many UFO spacecraft, for example - when here within our Third dimensional state of existence - actually ‘ ride ’ upon the magnetic fields generated by our planet, and in all probability also interact with the magnetic fields of other planets they choose to visit. Who, then, would have a better knowledge of this type of magnetic phenomenon than these highly advanced people? When Monitor tells us (albeit diplomatically) that we have a lot to learn, I, for one, see no reason to doubt him. - * - * - * -"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":" 178 XVII ====================================== ANCIENT ‘ GODS ’ & OTHER PUZZLES There has been much written by hundreds of different writers about the ancient 'Gods' having been Alien visitors from outer space. I have broached this subject with other 'entities' while Carole has been in deep trance states, and regardless of the answers I have received I still find myself drawn back to ask yet more questions about this fascinating subject. In nearly every culture, folklore and legends abound that relate to ancient gods and early visitors who came down from the sky. The ancient Vedic books of the Hindus tell of many early gods; Greek Mythology speaks of Gods vi siting and dwelling on Mount Olympus; Assyrian- Babylonian legends tell of Gilgamish, while Indonesian beliefs relate stories of ancient visitors. And so it goes. The Old Testament is full of stories that tell of visiting Angels, Voices from Heaven, Visitations, and other happenings, that cry out for sane and rational explanations instead of the unmitigated hogwash most theologians continue to pass on to their flocks. So, one more time, I turned to Monitor to further my knowledge on man's early history. \"During Earth's past ages - in our biblical times - there is mention of so-called 'heavenly messengers' the ancients referred to as 'Angels'. Just how physical were these beings and whom did they represent?\" \"Much of that which is reported within your history is merely a 'mystification' of those we term 'The Time Travellers',\" he said. \"They came, and were able to sustain life on Earth for a short time. They still visit the Earth.\" \"But I thought Archangels were part and parcel of the Pleiadians - the Star People?\""},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":" 179 \"This is correct.\" \"But isn't this a contradiction?\" I asked. \"One moment you're telling me these people were 'Time Travellers', and the next you're saying t hey are Pleiadians, part of the Pleiadian group.\" \"When we use the term 'Time Travellers', it is our descriptive for those who enter your time.\" \"From our biblical teachings during the times when the Star People were obviously in touch with the primitive tribes-people of the day we have read of many examples of the 'wrath of the Gods' being hurled upon different races and creeds,\" I told him. \"For example, from the ancient Greeks, came Zeus with his 'thunderbolts, then the Norse God, Thor, with his hammer of war and from our Judaic-Christian testaments we hear cries of 'Vengeance is Mine, sayeth the Lord! ’ . According to our scriptures there was mayhem, carnage, slaughter, and the destruction of large armies and cities carried out by these so-called 'gods' who came from the skies. \"Would you tell us if the Star People - the Pleiadians - were really this harsh and violent when dealing with the primitive people of this world?\" I asked. \"This is not of our understanding,\" he said. \"We are not. . . nor have been for eons of your time. . . a warring, punishing intelligence. That which your primitive man observed was often of his own doing. When the atmospheres of Earth were different - after the Gates were closed - the rebounding intelligence of man was swift to return to the Earth.\" I took this last paragraph to mean that, as man died, he 'rebounded' straight back into another incarnation in order to undergo further Eart hly experiences and greater refinement. And, as he did so, he believed it was the only way he could escape from his entrapment within the Earth's magnetic field. I went on to ask Monitor if the Star-People with their advanced technology and superior intelligence had been looked upon as 'Gods' by primitive Earth people. \"There were many from throughout the Univer se who have come to Earth with their"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":" 180 technology to enlighten and assist in the growth of the Earthman,\" he explained. \"There were also those who - when reincarnated into a body - remembered specifically their heritage and links and had no further incarnations of Earth to experience. Therefore they were as they were, and when the time for the ’ body changes ’ (or release of that which you refer to as the 'soul') they were able to return directly home. \"You have, in your history, many accounts of Earth man living to a great number of Earth years. . . 400 and 500 years. Indeed, these were those who - although trapped within the Earth - had taken body form yet still remembered their source. And, when they were released through that which you call 'death', were able to come home.\" He paused for a moment. \"But these were few in number,\" he added sadly. \"The picture you have just painted would have us believe that all of the Star People, and other Aliens who came to Earth and interfaced with our earlier more primitive ancestors, were benign, benevolent and loving people,\" I said. \"Yet our myths, legends and history books tell a vastly different story. They tell of 'gods' who were cruel, tyrannical and unforgiving, of gods who were swift and violent in both their retribution and treatment of the Earth people of the time. Even today we see examples of this cavalier and callous treatment in the abductions of Earth people by Alien creatures who, on a whim, violate both the rights, and the dignity of, those who against their will are forced to undergo physical probing and examination. \"These poor humans have had samples of ova, flesh, or semen removed under traumatic conditions - as if they were no more than microbes undergoing microscopic examinations. Then, after being petrified by the experience, they are put into a state of amnesia before being returned from whence they had come. You are telling me one thing, yet the evidence points to something quite different.\" \"You are experiencing that which we have sought to explain (and that is) the ‘ fear-factor ’ of the human being,\" he returned. \"We have (already) explained to you that there are still (those)"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":" 181 visitors who (come to Earth) seeking their own genetic links to the Earth people. \"We have also explained to you, that - for the safety of the individual mind concerned - there have been implanted ideas,\" he said. \"I know we have broached this subject before, but I needed to hear it again. This is exactly the point I have (in past sessions) been trying to make about mankind fearing your presence. To the vast majority of human beings you are still an 'unknown quantity'. \"Because of what has been going on during these abductions plus the history of earlier 'Gods' and their violent and dominating behaviour all Alien-beings - including the Star People - are now suspect in the minds of human beings,\" I told him. \"If you want to contact the Earth people - I don't mean just you, I mean ALL Alien Visitors - why can't you do it the same way we are doing it now? Use a gifted channel-medium, and this way, you can gain all of the information you need without anyone being traumatized.\" \"We explained to you that we of the Pleiades are trying in many, many ways, to under- stand the 'fear-factor' in man and woman and child. We do not find the fear-factor in your mind, therefore we understand that (your) mind is open,\" he said. \"And yet the information I have already given you regarding the fear-factor in man has no bearing?\" I asked. \"We have taken this information and we are, indeed, using this information,\" he replied. \"However, we again stress that there are many who come looking for the genetic link that was lost to them. It is because of this that many seem to have little regard for body structure or of mind as is now. \"We should also bring to your attention, again, that you are not informed of the many, many contacts that are requested from Earth people, and the contacts that are made that are of a peaceful and harmonious nature.\" \"Then, if this is true - and I have no reason to doubt what you are telling me - then I, for"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":" 182 one, (through this book), would like to be in touch with as many people as possible who have had bona fide peaceful and harmonious physical encounters with the Star People , \" I told him. This exchange of views had been forthright and candid. We on this planet Earth have a right to know the motives of those who would seek to use us as biological specimens. If we are genetically linked to these various alien visitors - and I for one am totally convinced that we are - then the least they can do is to ask both our permission and co-operation in helping solve whatever riddle may lie outside the boundaries of our current level of understanding. We, as soul-spirit individuals, are striving to reach an eventual level of refinement that will enable us should we so choose to be free of our Earth-bound body-structures forever. These 'vehicles' we have chosen to be born into while here on Earth - be they manifested or a product of Darwinian evolvement - are ours through which we are able to experience Third dimensional reality. No-one - be they human or A lien - has the right to either impose their will upon our Earthly bodies, or to touch or use them without the express permission of the soul-spirits who dwell within them. This is the key part of the Universal Rule of Freewill. - * - * - * - Monitor has, on several occasions, stated emphatically that the Pleiadians are not here to 'dominate' us, but to render aid to us in the coming 'changes'. To test this oft stated commitment, I posed my next question. \"Do Pleiadians have any sort of competitive gam es or rituals in the Pleiades system?\" I asked. \"Do you compete with each other in anyway?\" I need not have worried. His answer was appropriate and anticipated my motives. \"We understand your inquiry,\" he replied. \"And as to where it would lead.\" By way of"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":" 183 explanation, he added. \"We have different interpretations of the word 'competitive'. Since 'all' is for 'all', there is not - in our understanding - the same competitive vibration that is within the Earth's people.\" \"But you do have a hierarchy?\" I asked. \"There is a Council.\" \"And how does one become a member of the Council if not by competing with others for each position?\" \"One offers information,\" he explained. \"One offers understanding. And, when that understanding is proven to be effective and consistent, then - and only then - may one assume to Council.\" Once again, he had sidestepped my proffered 'bait' and easily turned the tables on me with a rational and logical explanation of how things are run in Pleiadian society. I returned to the issue at hand and expanded the questioning regarding the Pleiadian's competitiveness to include how they might wish to be perceived when they next manifest upon our planet. \"Man, it seems, is born with a strong penchant to worship or idolize those he considers superior to himself,\" I told him. \"Because of your advanced knowledge and technology, it is probable that man would instantly put all Pleiadians upon pedestals and worship you. Would you want this to happen - to be treated as Gods and worshipped by Earth people?\" \"This is not necessary,\" he replied. \"It belongs to misinterpreted feelings resonating within the Soul as it seeks to return home to the Source.\" \"Are you aware that you have already been tu rned into 'cult-figures' by many misguided Earth people?\" I asked. \"There are UFO Cults, Space and Star People Cults. . . in fact all manner of cults whose members wish desperately to idolize and worship those they see as superior beings. What is the real reason for this?\""},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":" 184 \"Man's desire to shirk responsibility for himself often leads to this type of hysteria,\" he replied. \"But if you joined us. . . if you came down to Earth to live among the Earth people and help us during the coming difficult years. . . how would you expect to be treated by mankind?\" \"Those who come to Earth to assist you are the same as one who would assist a child,\" he explained. \"It offers assistance and, when the offer is accepted, there is a resonance between us. When the offer is rejected, there is a sadness - although there is still an understanding.\" \"Would you impose rules or laws upon mankind if you joined us?\" I asked. \"There is only one Universal Law,\" he replied. \"The Law of Freewill.\" \"Not the Law of Love?\" \"Love is an energy,\" he responded. \"Is there any one group of people. . . or race. . . or creed. . . among us who might be considered 'special' by you? Any group you may hav e seeded who might consider themselves to be your chosen people?\" I asked. \"You use the word 'chosen' as a means to s eparate and indicate superiority?\" He enquired. \"Yes.\" \"We do not recognize this. We recognize that there are advanced races within the Universe - such as the Dial - who are ahead of us in their technology by maybe three to four thousand years,\" he explained. \"And we recognize that we are ahead of Earth-beings in technology, but we do not recognize superiority as in a form of domination. \"Man, until he understands that he must be 'accepting', will not be allowed into the Universe. Thus, the times of changing will, indeed, purify and awaken many of man's better qualities. That, which is deep within man, will be accelerated for those who are not yet awakened. You have to understand that, if you were not of Like-Mind - even as of now - you would have a sense of superiority over those who do not have open thei r minds to your understanding. This does not find"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":" 185 resonance within your Soul-Being for you realize that it is, indeed, not a (sense of) 'superiority' but is, rather, a commitment.\" I took this to be a gentle warning to all Like-Minded people to remember who they are, and what they are committing to. I pressed a little further. \"You have previously stated that there are many dimensions and/or Universes that would - and I will quote you here: \" Use up energy fields to create disharmony \" . Why would they wish to create disharmony? Why would any intelligence, in any dimension, deliberately want to create disharmony or be a disruptive force?\" I asked. \"There is a need within some to expand its energy force,\" he explained. \"Therefore it will use - and collect unto itself - all that (energy) that is not governed.\" \"In our earlier book, ” I told him, “ It was stated that 'energy' was neither 'good' nor 'evil' for it had no conscience. Do you agree with this?\" \"When energy is used as a form of conductor, ” he replied. ” It has no conscience.\" I moved on to a slightly different, though still related, subject: The relationship between man and the various 'tools' he creates and uses as an extension of himself. \"Our soul-spirit uses our physical body-structure as a vehicle, and then we employ this 'soul- vehicle' to build a variety of other 'vehicles' (i.e. ships, automobiles, bicycles, aircraft and a host of other appliances, computers, machinery, tools and c ontraptions ) with which to extend our physical capabilities in countless other areas. Are all of these mechanical devices also a part of us. . . an extension of our Souls?\" \"This is affirmative,\" he replied. \"That is most interesting,\" I remarked. \"You will now understand that you are, indeed, condensing your worl d and, in understanding this, you will begin to expand your knowledge. And, indeed, you will awaken to the understanding.\""},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":" 186 \"You have spoken many times of your ability to manifest into Third dimension reality. Is there any way you can describe the actual process of manifestation...how you create (your energy) into different life-forms upon the Earth?\" \"It is a ‘ slowing-down ’ of the mind process,\" he explained. \"As the mind affects the brain of the body - such as in sleeping, waking, meditating, blood flow and pain - it can also control the process of manifestation.\" \"What form of matter is used to create the physical being during the manifesting process?\" I enquired. \"The matter that is within the Earth structure.\" \"So, in the slowing down process, you are not creating matter from the Essence of Pure Energy, but simply utilizing the matter around you. Is this correct?\" \"That which is acceptable to man,\" he replied, meaning of course that they use only those elements that go to make up the body-structure of a human being. \"You use it in much the same way we utiliz e the matter around us to form our own bodies? ” I asked. “ The basic building-blocks that are selected and guided into a structure by the DNA helix within each of us?\" \"This is affirmative. If you were to look upon the body-structure of the Pleiades individuals, you would say they all look alike.\" “ I presume this would be because the Pleiadian body-structures duplicate themselves from a single directive-mechanism instead of a genetically induced principle such as DNA?. Today, we would call this a form of 'cloning'. “ Through Carole, Monitor nodded in assent. There was one more question I wished to ask before we ended the session, and it had to do with 'time dilation' and the possibility of being in two places at once over a prolonged period of time."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":" 187 \"Is it possible to reincarnate back into the same time period one has recently vacated?\" I asked him. “ To live another parallel life while one is still living a present Earthly existence?

However this is something of which you are still not aware.\" \"Then what you are saying is that there has to be a form of lineal continuity in the reincarnation process. . . that we must always go from one period to the next, and onto the next, and the next. . . and so on. Is it always forwards, or can it also be back?\" I asked. \"This is forward,\" he replied. Carole showed signs of stress and I asked Monitor to release her as soon as possible. He sensed her reactions and concluded she was beginning to 'separate' from his level of vibration, so without further ado he ended the communication, thereby bringing the chapter to a close. - * - * - * - "},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":" 188 XVIII ======================================================== REFINEMENT, DISEASE, INNER EARTH & PROPHESY Monitor has often spoken of our vibrational levels and how they determine our on-going development towards refinement. The higher our vibrations, he has told us, the more refined we become. I decided to ask him for more details about this part of our soul-spirit education and if, perhaps, there were some way of controlling or stimulating individual levels. I opened our next session with this in mind. \"How is it possible to raise our vibrational levels?\" I asked. \"Would you describe - as simply as possible - the steps we should take - or the physical effort we must undergo in order to raise our own vibrational levels?\" \"One of your physical efforts that is so much a part of your daily routine that it isn't recognized, can help you,\" he replied. \"If you understand that the simple action of drawing in a breath of air and releasing it into the body will, indeed, manifest many changes that you would term 'miracles' upon physical matter such as the body and the organs therein,\" he explained. He went on to warn us that what we sometimes perceive to be good for us - or, as he termed it, 'in harmony' with us - was, in fact, a form of disharmony. \"Harmony with that which is of sustenance to the brain, mind and also the etheric (that which you term to be natural for man) can, with wrong use of the mind, bring disease to the body,\" he explained. \"That which you ingest as your sustenance is also not that of the higher vibration. We would"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":" 189 offer you the thought that there is much that could, and should, be brought into harmony with each and every other emotional vibration upon the Earth,\" he told me. \"In essence, we would say, body and spirit must be raised to obtain a desire of dominance over disease of the mind and physical body.\" \"Is this in any way similar to the practice of Yoga?\" I asked. \"We seek verification,\" he replied. There was a brief pause, as he consulted his sources of general knowledge, and then he returned. \"This would be affirmative.\" \"So you are saying that, by using Yoga breathing exercises, we can increase our vibrational levels in order to ward off, heal, or overcome disease. Is this correct?\" I asked. \"This is correct. We would also offer the t hought that to recognize and understand that which is disease, is the greatest benefit of all.\" \"I'm not sure I follow you. Would you be more explicit?\" \"That which is of disease,\" he explained, \"is disruption of the mind, the spirit or the body. Therefore if you first recognize what causes these disruptions, then you discover a means of preventing the disease from reaching the body, the mind, or the spirit,\" he said, voicing, in effect, the old axiom; 'An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure'. He continued. \"What you term a ' mis -use of the mind' denotes di s-harmony. We would say, then, that the recognition of the dis-harmony itself is the greates t ally of prevention. When the mind or body is not in harmony, then disease is apparent.\" \"Yes, I do understand this,\" I assured him. \"We would offer you that the greatest cause of disease among you at this time is that of imbalanced emotions. If you will look to the emotion of fear and hatred, you will see the alignment of the diseases described within these lower vibrational levels. You will find a great many diseases masquerading in many ways within the body.\" \"You are saying that the 'ingredients' for disease are within the body at all times?\""},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":" 190 \"This is affirmative.\" \"And it is only the vibrational level within us - the psychological factor - that either permits or prevents the disease from taking hold?\" \"This is affirmative. And you will find that your scientists, so keen, have now devised a mechanism that can measure each and every frequency of the body, therefore being able to determine from a median scale the body vibrations. \"If you fall within the low category of vibrational matter while in the Earth's atmosphere, you will be susceptible to disease.\" He paused briefly, then continued. \"How, then, does one raise the vibration? One must look to the mind at this point and one must ask; 'Where is the mind that it allows the body to vibrate at such a low frequency?' You will find that the thinking of man greatly affects that which the body harvests and manifests.\" \"Is this part of the same principle of energy flow as used in acupuncture?\" I asked, unable to think of the term, ‘ Yin and Yang ’ at that precise moment. \"We will seek verification,\" he replied. Again he paused for a moment before continuing. \"We look to your thought pattern and we understand that which you reach for. We would tell you that these so-called 'ancient arts' of healing are merely a remembering of a more sophisticated form of healing the body function, for they are, in fact, tuning the body to a higher frequency. \"You have mentioned the use of objects (acupuncture needles) being placed to relieve energies within and without the body. We also tell you that these are conductors of energies and they will raise and release the frequency at which the entire body vibrates from within and without, thus making its mark within Earth's atmosphere. “ \"It was not intended that each soul-spirit should sustain a body for long intervals of time, as you understand it,\" he said. \"Therefore you will now understand a little more of that which you questioned before: The use and need for sleep.\" \"I am not familiar with the equipment you say our scientists are using to measure the"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":" 191 vibrational frequencies of the body,\" I told him. \"Can you tell me who uses this? Are they practitioners of holistic medicine? Chiropractors? Naturopaths? ” \"You will find this device among the more enlightened in your healings - those who turn to the 'natural sources'. You will also see that those who work with an entity in the health area of your Astronauts also have such a device.\" \"I will try to follow up with this information,\" I told him. \"Then you will ask this enquiring mind, for he w ill remember information given,\" Monitor intoned. \"Who is the 'enquiring mind' you are referring to?\" \"You request. . . we will seek.\" He paused briefly before answering. \"You will request information concerning same from the Astronaut with whom you are familiar,\" he instructed. I responded with the name of a former NASA Astronaut, familiar to Carole, but a person I had not met. The answer was affirmative. I saw no point in pursuing this avenue of discussion so turned to the subject matter of our Sun. \"Could you describe the 'life-forces ’ - the physical or other life-forces - that emanate from our Sun?\" I asked him. \"We have previously corrected you,\" he replied. \"We have offered you this thought - to be verified at a time in your future, as it is now unacceptable to you - that, indeed, your Sun's light and 'life-force' are reflected .\" \"Then what about the electromagnetic fields and other forces that originate within the Sun?\" I asked. \"The magnetic force from the Sun is also shielded, \" he replied. \"However it is in this context that we have great concern for your planet Earth. For the shields through which we and others manipulate your energies are greatly weakeni ng. You have opened yourselves to much danger.\" \"Is this because the strength of our magnetic shield is lowering?\" I asked."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":" 192 \"This is correct,\" he replied. \"To which field, force or charge does the Soul belong? Is it a weak or strong nuclear force? A magnetic field? Or is it part of the Essence of Pure Energy?\" \"It would be closer to that which you would determine to be nothing,\" he replied. \"For, in so determining, it is ‘ the all ‘ of something. \"The Soul can, indeed, be measured by all of those descriptions you have just given; nuclear, magnetic, and the Essence of Pure Energy. However, you must again use the word ' reflected ', for the Soul cannot - in a direct way - be measured, for this would be the same as asking to be shown the face of God. ” \"We are able to see and experience this by showing you each other, and (in so doing ) we show you the manifestation of Soul. But this is , at the present time, beyond your grasp,\" he said. \"Your understanding is growing vastly with our communication, and it is undergoing, as you would term it, 'shock'. We therefore ease you gently into understanding that the Soul is pure essence . It is, therefore - as you would understand - nothing !\" I thanked him, and told him that I appreciated both the answer and the care he was taking in my gradual enlightenment and awakening. I then reminded him that he had told me earlier that he was going to give us more information in the field of basic magnetic vibrations. I asked if he was now ready to do this. \"We will seek information as to basic magnetic vibrations,\" he replied. He paused for a long moment to consult with his 'associates'. \"Your simplest way of understanding this,\" he said, \"Is to use the (combined) 'essence' with which you are most familiar: Sound and Light. Indeed, you will be able to photograph the waves of sound (as has been already done by your scientists) that affect all material objects. We would, again, offer you - for the self - an experiment - the following. . . \" Monitor went on to describe in great detail a device that would utilize both light and"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":" 193 sound waves in the performance of a specific function. I thanked him for the information and explained that this experiment (along with other s he has given me) would have to wait for a while longer because I had neither the expertise, facilities, money, associates, nor time to develop such equipment until this book was finished. Although I didn't voice it at the time, I was also concerned with the potential hazards that might affect anyone within close proximity to such a device during a test period. He seemed aware of my problems. \"We understand,\" he told me. \"We also understand that which you have not voiced.\" \"Please continue,\" I said. \"Your concern is for the individuals involved,\" he stated, reading my mind, \"And you are also concerned from whence the materials will come to build this device because, at this time, you find you are unable to acquire them yourself. \"We advise you that we will bring to you those who will carry out your instructions. They will be of great benefit to you without seeking material gain for they will be of Like-Mind and interested in doing the same for the greater enlightenment. \"You will be contacted by those of another country,\" he told me. \"They will seek verification of the propulsion systems of our craft, and through this mind (Carole's) and your interpretation, we will release that which we are able to release to them. \"They will also have the scientists who are of Like-Mind with them, and together, you will manifest into Third dimensional form the closes t you can understand to this system; a system that will be enough to change your thoughts, and those of the world, on propulsion.\" Had I not received a great amount of additional material independently of these sessions with Carole, I might have dismissed this out of hand. But I now had enough faith in Monitor to take his words seriously. \"Is this information for general knowledge?\" I asked. \"Or must it be kept under wraps for the"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":" 194 moment?\" \"We will release it when the time is clear,\" he replied. \"That which you term 'scientist', is already on the outer edge of your communication. He is someone you have heard of, though not yet closely associated with you. His thoughts are for greater understanding and greater knowledge. He is not of this area, however, but he will be made known to you.\" \"You must understand my reticence in all of this,\" I told him. \"I cannot always trust those with whom we are dealing.\" \"We understand. Only those of Like-Minds will remain. Those of the Gross-Beings - because they cannot sustain the higher vibration - will be like that which passes as your electric current: They will be discharged.\" He hesitated - as if searching for a word or a phrase to explain something else to me. . \"We seek verification,\" he told me, and paused again. \"We will translate. \"That which is like a light bulb - and is no longer useful - are those of a lesser vibration even though they seek to sustain the current,\" he explained. \"They will only be able to use the power for a limited time before the circuit will be broken. . . the light will cease and they will journey on.\" \"I appreciate everything you are telling me,\" I told him. \"But I have had a feeling during this, and other sessions, that you are sometimes reluctant to pass on information to me. It is almost as if you had to consult with other minds or entities before the information is released to me. Why is this?\" \"You must understand that the communication be tween us is not of one mind,\" he explained. \"The information is passed through one mind to another mind, and indeed, at this time of communication, your mind is locked into the same frequency as that of your translator (Carole), and those who would communicate with you. \"We also have to answer to the Council, and therefore, must continually monitor the information that is passed through. Should we, in error, pass through information that this mind"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":" 195 could not handle or understand. . . or, in the widest sense, accept . . . we would do damage to this mind and it could result in a manifestation within the body and, also, within your mind and the minds of those you are about to reach,\" he said. \"You would call this 'insanity' because it is a fracturing of the mind.\" \"Thank you for telling me this,\" I said. \"I now understand what you were trying to tell me.\" \"Also,\" he went on, \"You must understand that the information - as given to you - requires your researching for the peace of your own mind. And when you find that, indeed, it is correct and is the essence of that which is of the highest calibre , you will also understand that - once it is released in general - there will be a stirring of the Gross-Beings and an area of negativity will surround you, and such minds as communicate with you. \"We must also be very aware that the information is passed on in such a way that only those of the highest vibration will be able to understand - verify - relate to it - and move forward with it.\" \"When you manifest in order to help us through the catastrophic changes ahead, ” I asked “ who will you contact first? Will it be our political leaders, our scientists, religious leaders, or our military people? Who will it be?\" \"You must understand that all are contacted at the same time,\" he answered \"but all will not accept at the same time. Only the Like-Minds with the same vibrational frequency will join. \"You may have two individuals who look into the sky at the same time: One will see our craft, the other will not. Then you will photograph us, and one will see - in the photograph - that, indeed, when looking into the skies, the craft was there but the mind was not able to see it. Only those whose awakening and realization are of our frequency will collect and make the changes. For, as we determined before, that which is not of our frequency will destruct, or their minds will split.\" \"And, in splitting?\" I asked. \"Will be released. ” He paused. “ You have an understanding of the occult term, 'Posses-"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":" 196 sion'?\" \"Yes.\" \"Those who are in jeopardy of being 'possessed' will be saved,\" he said. \"You must understand that the Gross Being is very powerful. That which it does not possess, it must control. If the vibration - though high - is weak, it will be overridden. \"However, when a high vibration that is free, clear and strong gathers to itself the weaker like-minds, it is also able to free them.\" I thought about this for a moment before firing the next question. \"When the changes occur, how much protection will be needed to protect all life forms on Earth - that is animal, plant, as well as human - from contamination by the cosmic and solar activity once the magnetic shield has collapsed?\" I asked. \"A great deal of protection will be needed, and a great deal will be given,\" he replied. \"It is the opinion of Council that it may indeed be necessary to sacrifice a small - as yet, undeveloped - planet in order to save planet Earth. This would act as a shield.\" \"You are speaking of the planet that will enter our system in the near future?\" I asked. \"This is affirmative.\" \"Would it be possible to create small magnetic fields to protect small areas from the solar winds, magnetic storms and cosmic radiation?\" \"It is already in effect,\" he replied, \"And, yes, that has been considered by the Council. As yet we are unable to determine the severity of the conditions which will be inflicted upon the Earth.\" \"Is it possible to get instructions from you, and the Council, as to how we can construct such shields?\" I enquired. \"This is possible,\" he said. \"However, this will not be available until there have been two - what you would call disasters - upon the Earth within the coming of the year. For these will make a slight change as to the manifestation of magnetic fields and pulses within the Earth. ” He paused"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":" 197 again before continuing. “ These you will associate with the re-appearance of the land you associate with Atlantis.\" He continued with another cryptic message similar to one used by The Voice in 'The Skull Speaks'. \"As we have informed you, 'Atlantean' is a state of mind, not of land, and has yet to appear bringing with it a still-trapped consciousness which will change again slightly the magnetic fields of the Earth.\" \"You previously said that you were 'still of the Earth'. Does this mean that your soul-spirit is still trapped within the magnetosphere of this planet?\" I asked. \"This was a communication that we wanted you to understand, ” he replied. “ That you and we are as One. It is not that we are of the Earth, but that you are with us, for - as you will understand - we are. . . he stopped abruptly. \"We seek verification. . . \" He paused again. \"Wheresoever thou goest, I goest also. . .\" I waited for a few moments for him to continue, but when he didn ’ t, I tried to get him back on track. \"To continue along this vein,\" I said. \"The physicist-entity - with whom I was communicating when we first began these sessions - also made a similar remark. He said: 'I am more of the Earth than you. You only occupy space - and a very small amount of space. ’ What exactly did he mean? Would you explain this more fully for us?\" \"Because in the time that you call your 'creation', we were ‘ as-one ’ with the Earth,\" he explained. \"The Earth planet is like a child to those of the Pleiades. The Earth people and the Pleiadians are as one. You are our children.\" \"When this physicist-entity spoke of occupyi ng a very small amount of space, did he mean here on this Earth, or the parallel Earth?\" I asked. \"In this context it would be referring to the planet Earth, as you understand it,\" he said. \"For,"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":" 198 as yet, you do not understand that that which is parallel, is also of One.\" \"But it is not a physical world, is it?\" \"In your understanding of the term 'physical'?\" He asked. \"Yes.\" \"It is 'physical' inasmuch as it can be seen by those who are able to look into the next dimension easily.\" \"You are saying, in effect, that the 'scales' must be removed from one's eyes before they are able to see this other world. A sort of ‘ awakening ’ ?\" \"This is affirmative.\" I moved to another topic. As many of my questions pertained to material we had touched upon in earlier sessions, I decided to continue with a series of seemingly unrelated questions in an effort to get both greater detail, and further elaboration on some of the answers he had already given. . \"You have said that 'thought' is a form of energy . . . and you have implied that it was a sort of ‘ construction tool ’ used to create manifestations from raw matter. Would you elaborate on what you meant by this?\" I asked - then hastily added, \"The term ‘ construction-tool ’ is mine, I hope it doesn't throw you.\" \"We have given, previously, that all that is manifest within the Third dimension is demonstrated first by that which you term 'thought'. That which you term 'thought' is energy fed, and energy fed will either be from a high vibration or from a low vibration,\" he explained. \"When it is of a dense and low vibration, a manifestation will appear. . .usually of your warring type.\" \"So, this form of 'thought-energy' has little to do with Freewill or refinement?\" \"Thought, at its highest vibration, will contain that which is the essence of Freewill,\" he"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":" 199 stated. \"For that which would be of a negative vibration - a negative 'thought pattern' entering the brain - would be dismissed.\" \"Speaking of 'essence', ” I said, referring to his use of the term ‘ essence of Freewill ’ , “ you stated earlier that 'the essence of mind is the reflection of light creation'. Would you explain this in more detail, please?\" \"The essence and the reflection of light creation is that which you term ‘ Soul ’ .\" And, as abstract as his answer may seem, it made a great deal of sense to me at the time. The essence of pure light is, in fact, exactly the same as the Essence of Pure Energy ( EPE ) - that incredible non-substance from which everything in our Universe is made. Soul is EPE , therefore EPE is Soul . There is no separation. . . no fragmentation. . . no division of any kind whatsoever within the realm - or dimension - from which EPE and ALL-THAT-IS comes from. Why? Because EPE is THE ONENESS THAT IS ALL! So what does Monitor mean when he uses the term reflected? What exactly is reflected light? Or reflected soul? Or, for that matter, reflected anything? And, more important, why does whatever it is have to be reflected? The answer is surprisingly simple. The life within us - within all life-forms - is a reflection of the light of creation that emanates from the Nth dimension and passed through the Stars into our Third dimensional Universe. The radiance emanating from each and every Star is but a reflection of its source as it passes into the world of Third dimensional reality. Everything around us is a form of 'reflected light' - a form of EPE - converted into the physical building blocks of life. When Monitor describes the energy and light from our Sun as being 'reflected', he is stating that it isn't light-energy coming directly from the Nth Dimension - for energy of such purity would destroy anything and everything of a physical natur e in its path - but that it is the vibration of"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":" 200 EPE that has been slowed down and converted (reflected) into MASS. Only the very essence of life - i.e. the soul-spirit, or basic life-force - can meld with the Oneness of the Nth Dimension. Nothing of substance. . . of physical matter . . . can enter through the 'gates' - or 'converter points' - that lie between the Third and Nth dimensions. At last, I was beginning to get a better understanding of Monitor's oft-used term; 'reflection', so, with a modicum of satisfaction, I moved on to further develop several other subjects we had touched upon in earlier chapters. \"In our second session, information was telepathically relayed through Carole's trance- channelled mind by UFO occupants who claimed thei r craft's propulsion system 'sucked up energy' enabling them to 'break free'. I presumed they were talking about a system that 'sucked up' energy from the surrounding particles or molecules in space, converting it into a propulsive force which, in turn, enabled them to break free. Would you clarify this, please?\" I asked him. \"It was rejecting the gravitational pull?\" He responded. \"And by 'sucking up', it was using the particle-wave light energy around it?\" \"The light energy it is able to draw upon. This is the sustenance of the Earth not yet understood, but in time, you will understand it,\" he replied. 4 - * - * - * - 4 It is important to note that this session took place during the summer of 1989. Eight years later - in 1997 - Scientists at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Centre in California succeeded - for the first time - in producing particles of matter from light!. "},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":" 201 XIX  ===========================================  THE WORLD AND AIDS At the time we began the sessions for this book, AIDS had already taken a ghastly toll throughout the world, and since then most of the predictions regarding the deadly virus that had been made back in the late 1980's either by - or through - The Monitors have already come to pass. Regrettably, many beautiful and talented young people have learned to their sorrow that 'Freewill' really does play an incredibly important role when it comes to choosing a life style that can lead directly to HIV, then on to AIDS. Today - in the early part of 2002 - nearly everyone knows that promiscuous, un-protected sex, drug abuse and the spread of the deadly AIDS virus are closely related. But something we didn ’ t know when we began these sessions with our channelled contacts was that many of those who had become infected with the HIV virus [and which subsequently developed into full-blown AIDS] had actually chosen to reincarnate at this time in order to contract the deadly disease as part of their Karma! By exercising their Universal right of Freewill, they had deliberately singled out a specific life style that paid little heed to the dangers and risks of contracting the disease through the use of drugs and promiscuous sex . For some time prior to that session with Carole and The Monitors, I had been pondering as to whether or not the HIV-AIDS curse was some divine plan - a deliberately conceived man- made plot - aimed at wiping out large segments of the human population. I decided to pose the question to The Monitors in the hope they may have an answer. I gave Monitor the outline and waited for his response. \"(It is) a prime example of man's folly,\" he explai ned. \"We would tell you that this disease, as"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":" 202 you know it to be called - or the idea behind it - was to eliminate certain strains of humanity upon the Earth. Yes, you are right in your feeling that a greater hand played a part, for there are those who understand the 'outside' influences (and oppose them) for they consider them to be invaders, perpetrators, or those who would use mankind to their own ends. They gave unto those who would seek domination the ability to release, kill, or change those they felt would offer opposition to their thoughts or to their ways. They (became) engaged in a form of destruction.\" At the time of these sessions, I had scant knowledge of either HIV or AIDS. Nor, for that matter, did I know much about the various methods of transmission that was spreading it around the world. I had, however, garnered that it was not a true 'sexually transmitted' disease (such as syphilis & gonorrhoea) and that it could easily be contracted through love-making and sexual intercourse by both homo and heterosexual partners via un-healed lesions or other tissue damage that would allow direct admittance of the vi rus into the bloodstream. I was also becoming aware of the conspiracy of silence that seemed to exist within nearly all of the government agencies and health departments around the world as to where it had first started and the truth about its origin. At that time, there were several rumours going around as to how the virus had first come into being. One rumour hinted that it had been created in an US laboratory as a biological warfare experiment and had been tried out on various human guinea pigs in the States as a possible ‘ weapon of war ’ against humanity. 5 It was also believed that the virus had originally come from Africa and was linked to a species of prim ate referred to as the 'Green Monkey'. Still other stories linked it to the residual scab that formed on the udders or under-bellies of cows who had received the Hepatitis B vaccination. The sc abs were subsequently scr aped from the cows and used as the basis for a vaccine. The program of misinformation and disinformation orchestrated by various Governments and agencies around the wo rld to cover up the full extent of the damage  5 In June/2001, an item appeared in the news claiming that there were 22 million people in Africa afflicted with HIV and/or full-blown AIDS. I am still conv inced that my earlier estimate of 75 m illion people is the more accurate of the two. Later, in July/2001 I read of a reve lation of the 1771 U.S. Special Flow Char t that has been revealed by International Human Rights Activist, Dr Boyd E.Graves in which he di scloses and documents the secret virus development program which he claims is responsible for today ’ s global HIV/AIDS crisis. For more information contact Dr Boyd at: < ed@boydgraves.com > "},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":" 203 the virus was about to do - plus who was responsible for starting it - was being deliberately spread through the media back in the 80's. Having read and listened to a great deal of information on the subject [and also viewed an informational documentary based on the AIDS research being done at the time by Dr Robert Strecker ] I became aware of a small pox vaccination program that was being blamed for the spread of HIV/AIDS throughout Africa followed - a short while later - by its introduction into the Western hemisphere through a Hepatitis B vaccination program which, it was believed, had first accidentally introduced the HIV/AIDS virus into the gay communities in the United States where it had spread like wild-fire from the east coast of the USA to California in the west. Having been born in East Africa - and also having spent some time in India - I had conjectured (during the mid to late 1980's) that Africa, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, The Philippines, Central and South America - plus many other tropical areas around the globe - would be decimated by the HIV/AIDS virus within ten to twenty years from that time. This conviction was based on the fact that the deadly viral infection would be spread rapidly by the myriad of disease-carrying tropical and semi-tropical insects that exist within these areas. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) in a somewhat transparent attempt to allay the fears among the tropical zone populations, has repeatedly denied t hat mosquitoes in particular (and possibly, ticks, fleas, and other blood-sucking insects) can carry the virus. The Official stand by the medical profession would have us believe that the AIDS/HIV virus can ONLY be spread through ‘ unsafe ’ sex with an infected party (i.e without condoms or other genital protection) or by using drug needles contaminated by someone with HIV or AIDS. This, to me, was patently ridiculous! To first claim that even the most minute trace of tainted blood on a syringe needle is capable of transmitting the HIV/AIDS virus to other people yet - at the same time - expect us to believe that ordinary common-or-garden blood-sucking tropical or semi-tropical insects cannot pass on the disease is really a hard nut to swallow! The fact that malaria, black water fever, encephalitis lethargica, filariasis, elephantiasis, dengue fever, yellow fever, sleeping sickness, the Black Plague - plus more than 80 other viral diseases - can be spread by bloodsucking insects seems completely irrelevant to the wise sages"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":" 204 of the medical profession. If any of these so-called experts who insist on voicing such a claim are willing to spend three days with several AIDS-infected patients in a small ward in any poor African or Indian mosquito-infested village - and be willing to sleep there without using mosquito netting , insect sprays or bug-repellants - then, and only then, will the rest of the world take comfort in their assurances. At the time of that session I had done a fair amount of research on data garnered from different sources as to the actual number of people affected world-wide by either AIDS or HIV, and estimated that by the year 2000 there would be close to 75 million people in Africa alone who would test positive either with HIV or full- blown AIDS providing those tests were applied across the full continent. I presented this figure to Monitor and asked if (a) the estimate was right, and (b) what, if anything, might be done to prevent the spread of the disease. He replied. \"We do not understand your 'numbers', but we understand your reasoning mind. However we will offer you that you have not (yet) understood the intervention that we have also placed. While we do not make our presence as dramatically felt (as other 'Alien' intruders), we are still here to impede or, indeed restrict, any further progress of those who seek to take the Earth unto its own. Therefore we will say to you, there will be - as we have previously told you - a great cleansing of the Earth.\" I was not sure I understood what he meant by this. I didn ’ t know whether or not he was referring to a catastrophic reduction by which the Earth's population in spec ific areas of the globe would be wiped out through the Earth changes, or whether he was talking about the AIDS virus as being a part of this 'cleansing' process. I hazarded a guess that he meant both. I went on to ask if there would be a cure for the AIDS virus in the foreseeable future and if, by any chance, a possible cure or retardant might lie in the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation. Monitor paused for a moment before responding. \"There are many ways to counteract disease as you will well understand. We must use whichever is most compatible with man,\" he said. \"The correction of diseases that you understand is for those we will term The Children of the New Beginning...\""},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":" 205 He must have seen the puzzled look on my face for he stopped briefly before adding, “ You are a Child of the New Beginning “ , he said, and for some reason or other I knew instantly he was not speaking of this current lifetime, but to a reincarnation I would experience in the future. He continued. \"The cleansing of your planet is most necessary for we will not allow the domination of the planet Earth by any other than those Earth beings who seek a higher vibration,\" he explained, \"therefore it is permissible for those with disease - and those whose vibrations cannot be attuned to a higher radiation - to go through the 'cleansing of death' in order to return again.\" Carole was tiring and, as we were just about running close to the end of the tape, I wound up the session by asking Monitor for the simplest and most expedient method of contacting him in the future. \"If your Earth conditions are compatible,\" he told me, \"You have merely to repeat that which you have entered into.\" I assumed he meant I would again be contacting him through Carole, but didn't pursue it. I thanked him and bade him a fond adieu until our next meeting. Little did It I know at time the discoveries I, personally, would be led to make, and the information and ideas that - quite independent of Carole ’ s direct contact with The Monitors - would flow through my mind over the next few months. - * - * - "},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":" 206 XX  ================================================  CHLADNI DISCS, VISIONS OF THE CN TOWER On September 19th, we began Session #8 after a two-month break. During this time, I had completed writing up all of the previous sessions and had a chance to evaluate the material. Some areas needed further development while others required more research before I would be able to formulate additional questions. As Carole started to slip into a trance-channel mode, she began to drift freely in search of contacts. After a few minutes she began relaying some of the impressions she was receiving from around her. \"I am being told to tell you that they are ex tremely. . . er. . . extremely. . .er, 'Happy' is the word they choose, not 'pleased'. They are happy with the work you have put in.\" \"Who is telling you this?\" I asked. \"Somebody on this. . . this. . . \" She hesitated for a moment. \"I want to say 'Spaceship', but I don't really know if it is a Space-ship.

Both of them put a hand - sort of - in the middle of my back. . . and I'm still looking out through the windows. They're very tall - I'm not looking at them, but I know I can see them - and they seem sort of very fine featured, tall and slim.\" \"Are these ‘ beings ’ in solid form?\" I asked. \"Very solid. . . like I am.\" She paused, somewhat puzzled by what she was seeing and experiencing. \"Oh, I'm not so solid! I feel solid, though.\" \"Any sense of their vibrational levels?\" I enquired. \"It is their hand(s) in the middle of my back that is making me vibrate to their level,\" she responded. \"They are wearing a sort of 'uniform' - a coverall thing - but it ’ s something like. . . er. . . like dolphin skin - and it breathes!

It bounced off the sleeve of this person, and then something happened in the machine.\" She thought about this for a moment before continuing. \"It has something to do with language.\" \"Language?\" I asked. \"Or is it like the sound of language?\" \"The sound,\" she replied. \"Would you care to develop this, I think it pertains to. . . or is linked to. . . the vibrational"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":" 208 levels you are sensing between you?\" \"It has something to do with my brain and their communication,\" she replied. \"It makes my brain able to perceive their communication in a 'language' of sorts, although I don't think it really is a language.

There are so many things. . . \" Her voice trailed off. \"Is it possible to take a word - or, I should say, a sound - and translate it into a 'picture- pattern' that would be instantly recognizable to both you, and to them?\" I asked. She thought this over for a long moment as she searched the scene around her. \"It makes a pattern,\" she said flatly. There was another pause. \" that's what those rings are for - those areas - they're a form of energy!\" She seemed surprised. \"Let's use an example,\" I suggested. \"The sound made by a dolphin or a whale. If this sound could be used to form a vibrational pattern - one that would be recognizable to you - it would be instantly translatable to you, wouldn't it? Do you understand what I'm saying?\" \"Yes.\" \"It would become a 'sound-picture' - language written by sound. It would mean the same thing in many languages even though the 'word-sounds' of each language were different.\" I was becoming excited as the concept began to evolve in my mind. \"That's exactly what they're telling me!\" She exclaimed. \"We are talking of visual vibrational-harmonics, here. A sort of 'Chladni' picture - the type of thing Hans Jenny developed. . . \" I began, but she interjected her own thoughts into the discussion. \"He had some of the right ideas, but not all of them were valid. He tried to over-complicate things,\" she stated flatly. \"Who, Jenny or Chladni?\" I asked. \"Jenny.\" She cocked her head to one side as if listening intently to something being related to her. \"They say it will be you who will understand,\" she said, but her voice was very low and -"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":" 209 although it had been picked up by the tape recorder - I wasn't sure I'd heard her properly. I asked her to repeat what she had just told me. \"You will be given the opportunity because something must be done soon.

A planet - there's a name. . . \" Her voice dropped lower and lower, making it very difficult to hear what she was saying. I asked her to switch from the two small crystals she was holding to the large hunk of Brazilian crystal she had been using during the other sessions. I handed it to her and her energy level began to pick up dramatically. However, she did not repeat the name of the planet. The suggestion that I would be given the opportunity to do something regarding an inter- communication with dolphins left me a little baffled. My knowledge of 'visual vibrational harmonics' is extremely limited. I was vaguely aware of the wo rk pioneered by the 18th century physicist, Ernst Chladni, and had read that - by placing a variety of substances (sand, metal filings, liquids, etc.) on metal discs and then vibrating them with a horsehai r violin bow - he had discovered he could create a multitude of different 'vibrational patterns' in the material on the discs as each substance reacted accordingly to the different frequencies generated by the bow. These patterns (now known as Chladni figures) would 'line up' into harmonic configurations on the surface of the discs. It was this picture that had entered my mind - a vibrational picture-pattern that could be used to translate all word-sounds into a common 'language'. . . one that could be readily understood by us. Later research led me to the work done by Hans Jenny, a Swiss scientist, who had taken Chladni's ’ work a great deal further with his invention of a 'tonoscope' - an electronically operated device that converts sounds , speech, music, etc. into visual patterns - and these, in short, were the type of vibrational patterns I had envisioned."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":" 210 Recent developments in sound recordings and audio-visual patterns (as shown on the screen of an oscilloscope) have indicated an incredible audio-visual similarity between various species of birds, mammals and human beings as each species vents - or expresses - an emotion in its own 'language' or sound. For example, a warning sound - be it from lion, song thrush or man - produces an almost identical graph-line in levels of frequency. A distress call, a mating call, or territorial challenge, all provide similar visual patterns on an oscilloscope screen. To me, this indicates that there is a common communicational link between all of the so-called 'higher' species of animal life. The linguistic patterns may vary, but the underlying emotion or thought patterns carried within the audible vocal sounds of each individual species, will always appear as almost identical sound patterns on the screen of an oscilloscope! However, the patterns formed on an oscilloscope are not the same as those created on a metal Chladni disc to which sand (or other fine-grained substances) have been sprinkled. For when these discs are vibrated at different frequencies, each vibrational frequency will leave a distinctive pattern. . . a virtual -pictograph of a specific vocalized emotion . . . which, regardless of the animal or creature emitting the sound (be it projected by baboon, dolphin, yellow-bellied sapsucker or flaxen-haired Princess held prisoner atop a castle wall - will always remain within the parameters of the original pattern! This was the point I had been trying to make to Carole at the time she connected with the Spaceship entities at the start of this session. I am fairly sure this idea is not a new one - and reasonably sure that others, far more advanced in the knowledge of cymatics, will have already developed such a means of converting basic vocalizations into visual patterns. At the time of this session, I had no idea of where these researchers had taken this hypothesis, yet inwardly hoped their research and development would help bridge the gap between man and other animal species who share our planet."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":" 211 The Brazilian crystal had given Carole the energy she needed to drift into a deep trance- channel state, and as she sank slowly through the dimensional barriers, I instructed her to communicate directly with Monitor. After a substantial pause, Monitor came through. \"We are in harmony,\" he said. \"How may we help you?\" \"I wish to return to the subject I was discussing with the Alien-entities Carole has just been communicating with,\" I told him. \"It concerns harmonics and the use of vibrational patterns to translate different languages between all forms of life. . . whether it a whale, dolphin, human, bird, or any other animal,\" I said. I then went on to explain the basic premise and asked Monitor if he believed such a pictographic system would work. \"Affirmative,\" came his reply. \"Even now t hey experiment in such a way upon your planet Earth. However, since they who are in cont rol of such experimentation dominate (are G-B ’ s), there have been obstructions laid in their path, causing delays until Like-Minds will be in a position to understand this type of communication. For, as it presently rests, your scientific community - at this time in your understanding - is at a loss to put final understanding to their investigation. \"It will take the key in the information you have been given - both through our communica- tion, and the communication of the mind - before it is fully understood. You have the key and your expertise will be sought after,\" he said. We went on to discuss the concepts of sound patterns as they interact with - and deeply affect - all organic and non-organic materials on Earth. I alluded to the writings of Dr. Lyall Watson in his book, 'Supernature', and his exquisite exposition of the life-pattern formulae within nature that are seemingly 'conducted' by DNA in to forming every conceivable life-form we know.

Every vibrational level has a distinct form that determines the uniqueness of pattern in all natural creations. A spiral helix, a concave shell, a 'sundial' - or other crystalline forms of a shell - are all determined by the vibrational-frequency levels and the harmonic interactions between each level. Just as a symphony orchestra combines individual musical vibrations into notes and melodic counter-structures, so too does 'nature' combine the zillions of possible vibrational levels into countless permutations of shape, form, depth, colour, size and density. Each of these variations interact in such a way that they blend in harmoniously with the delicate ecological balance of this planet. It is indeed regrettable that it is man - and only man - who brings disruption to this incredibly delicate balance of nature. I did not know then - nor do I know now - anything about the 'key' that Monitor claims I ‘ m supposed to hold that may help solve the riddle of interactive communication within multi-species life-forms. I do know, though, that there is a distinct link between vibrational patterns and the creation of all matter and form.

That is, 'reflected light'. . . 'reflected sound'. . .

Here was yet another 'truth' behind the 'truth', and I began to see still further into a mystery I thought I had already solved! This time, however, I felt I was beginning to see something of the totality of the theory of 'reflection'. I began to see the analogy between the Essence of Pure Energy and the vibration of music within the context of the 'reflected' theory. I saw a metal disc sprinkled with sand as being representative of a medium sized sun. . . a large star. . . or a giant quasar. All would remain forever lifeless unless the substance of which they are made (represented by the sand on the disk) is activated by a vibratory source - be that music or the vibrational levels of the Nth dimension.

As the frequency of a vibration changes its level, the sand on a Chladni disc changes its pattern in exactly the same way all other physical phenomena react to the harmonic vibrations of nature. All shapes, sizes and life forms within our Universe are a direct result of the interaction between matter and the vibrational levels of energy and, like the Chladni disc, they become visible only when they reflect the energy that gives them life. I presented this analogy to Monitor and asked if I were now closer to the true meaning of his term, 'reflected'. \"You have understood,\" he replied. \"You mean I've finally got it?\" I was both surprised and relieved. \"This is affirmative. We offer you: 'Your Sun is that which is reflected'.\" \"So, by analogy, our Sun is a 'sand-disc' and the radiant energy and life-force we see, feel, and experience from it, is a direct result of an interaction between the Essence of Pure Energy (from the Nth dimension) and our Third dimensional reality. It is the state where matter is reflecting EPE . Is this correct?\" \"This is affirmative,\" he replied. \"Thank God!\" I exclaimed. \"I've been hunting for weeks for an answer!\" \"Then you should have been hunting in the memory banks of your mind,\" he admonished. \"To access the memory banks of your mind is a more simple task than studying that which has been spoken and written by others.\" \"I'm beginning to realize the truth in that.

I wondered whether or not the vibrational-harmonics between various races, creeds, or nations as a whole, had a bearing on the actual geographical location of their domicile, or whether it emanates from the vibrational levels of individuals themselves. I tossed the question to Monitor. \"What constitutes harmonic vibrations between people?\" I asked. \"You will understand when we offer you the explanation that each and every individual carries the essence of the One-ness. Therefore, when it reaches a point of understanding itself, it is able to feel the interaction of that sameness in another. When the mind remembers that - that which it perceives through the eyes can, at times, be deceptive - it then becomes more in tune with the vibrational levels of all in this dimension. It is 'like attracting the like': It is of the brother and the brother.\" \"Each and every large city I have been to throughout the world, has a vibrational pattern that you can actually feel. It is often quite palpable the moment you reach the outskirts of some cities. It is a pulse, a beat that, in some places, quickens one's own pulse with excitement. Many people refer to this ‘ throb ’ of a city as having either good or bad vibes. Is this a true evaluation?\" \"This is correct,\" he replied. \"What causes of this?\" \"There are areas of the Earth - deep within the Earth - that still hold within them negative forces,\" he replied. \"There are those areas of the Earth that vibrate to a higher vibration so, therefore, as each individual is pulled to that vibr ation it will be intensified and felt many, many, of your Earth miles away. It is also understood that the further you progress into your skies from that area, the easier it is to feel this vibration.\" \"But wouldn't the inhabitants of a city - the people themselves - contribute something towards the vibrational pattern of the place?\" I asked. \"Yes, this is affirmative.

He told me that if I were to question Carole at a later date, she would be able to give me the locations of these places. After the session, I followed up on this suggestion and Carole did, indeed, give me the exact locations Monitor had been talking about. Not surprisingly, they coincided exactly with locations to which I had long been yearning to go! Monitor continued to expand on the 'vibes' information, developing it into areas that were somewhat surprising to me. \"We wish, at this time, to pass to you information concerning the destruction of the physical body by the vibrations you have just discussed. We wish to pass on information that, within the range of one mile from this area,\" he said, meaning within one mile of where we - Carole and I - were sitting, \"there is instrumentation which gives off vibrations . . . which gives off waves. . . which gives off that which is of negative force to the physical bodies within the area. “ \"You understand that that which is called 'White Noise' - 'White Sound' - is very detrimental to the health of the body and the mind,\" he explained. \"You will understand that the waves that are used to 'conduct' (broadcast) through your air are being misused and are misunderstood. Indeed, the frequencies at which they are transmitting will cause breakdown within the bony structures of the body in many of your young, and in many of your elderly. Indeed, it will cause disintegration of the body structure most rapidly. \"You will find that which at one time upon the Earth were thought to be eradicated 7 will be  7 Over the last few years many of the diseases that were believed to have been eradicated by wonder drugs and modern medicine have begun to re-emerge: tuberculosis, etc."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":" 217 more prevalent due to the excitement of these waves upon the body structure.

Electromagnetic radiation (EMR) embraces a vast range of frequencies - from the ionizing gamma rays and X-rays (which, by knocki ng electrons from atoms, create highly reactive ions) - through to the Ultra High Frequency (UHV) used in television transmissions, radar, weather satellites and microwave ovens, etc., right down to the medium and low frequency wavelengths used in navigation signals, AM radio broadc asts and military communication systems. E.R. transmissions are not produced solely by T.V. and Radio transmitters, but also by the million or more high-voltage power lines - carrying both AC and DC fields - that are strung across the continents of the world. These power lines act as super-giant broadcast transmitters that actually broadcast 60 Hz wavelength radio wave s into our already fragile environment 24 hours per day times 365 days per year - thereby making them the largest and most powerful radio wave transmitters on Earth ! Researchers have found that radar technicians experience an unusually high build up of protein in their spinal fluids, and definite patterns of brain damage have been discovered after they have been exposed to high levels of microw ave energy over a number of years. These links indicate a dangerous interaction between externally transmitted radio frequencies and the brainwaves found in all of the higher primates up to, and including man."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":" 218 There is a growing field of literature pertaining to E.R. research and its effects on all life- forms (human, animal and plant) on this small, fragile planet.

He prefers to leave the care and well-being of his own existence and well being to the 'experts' in any given field even though he is aware that some of them may also have a vested interest in the very thing from which they are supposed to be protecting him! I needed to know how accurate Monitor's estimate of earthly distance was when he had stated that, 'within one mile ‘ of where I was currently residing something was broadcasting waves detrimental a person ’ s physical body'. I opted to press him further on the subject. \"The mind - through which you are now communicating - has a good idea of distance,\" I began, \"Would you scan her mind to determine the accuracy of your statement regarding the distance of this broadcast signal from here.

I asked Monitor if this is what he was referring to but he indicated it wasn't. \"There are different communications devices,\" he said. \"We will look for. . . microwaves. You understand microwaves?\" He asked me. \"Yes, I do,\" I replied. \"Not as an expert, but in general.\" \"This tower emits in the area of the microw aves, as do many, but those who use these waves do not understand that which they are emitting.

We wish to emphasize that you look at the physical structure of the brain for there you will see the 'pattern', so described by you, in many instances.\" I understood exactly what he was driving at. Many of the 'Chladni ‘ figure patterns on sand- covered discs take on a form - or pattern - that closely resembles a cross-section of a human or animal brain. . . it is as if one were looking at a CAT-SCAN picture of the brain itself! However, I was not sure whether Monitor was referring to electro-magnetic waves, or waves formed by sound. I posed the question. \"This would be both, in your understanding,\" he replied. \"At this time, however - as your enlightenment/awakening progresses - you will understand that there is, indeed, a vast difference between the two. But, at this time in your understanding, we will say that there is a sameness.\" - * - * - * - I had, at that time, an intuitive desire to move from the city of Toronto to another location but had no real idea of where I should re-locate. I presented this to Monitor. \"We have given, in other communications, that you will, indeed, be transferred from this area. We tell you that the area to which you will go will be under another flag,\" he said. \"That's a pretty broad area,\" I quipped, \"Could you be a little more specific?

I won't press you for an answer. . . \" \"Arizona!\" He exclaimed. This wasn't the answer I was looking for, but I wasn't surprised by Monitor's sudden outburst. I have always had a great fascination for that part of the world. . . especially the desert and semi-desert areas. I once spent a short while in the Sind Desert in India, and have also seen, from the decks of ships as they passed through the Suez Canal, the vast reaches of sand-filled deserts as they stretched off into the shimmering hills beyond. It is as if some ancient memory still vibrates in the deep recesses of my mind. . .and the shifting sands act as a mnemonic trigger to re- awaken my Earth-bound soul to an ancient knowledge I had once shared . I have visited Arizona briefly but make no claim to knowing it. I enjoyed what I saw, and was drawn to explore the area further despite the fact that, at the time, I was suffering rather badly from a dose of 'Montezuma's Revenge' - contracted during a brief stop for tacos in El Paso, Texas. However, much and all as I was intrigued by Arizona, I must admit that if I had my 'druthers', I would rather settle for a semi-tropical island paradise like Hawaii, St Lucia or the Canary Islands. He read my mind. \"The areas where you seek to reside will undergo 'changes',\" he said. \"You will, therefore, harmonize at a different level at that time.\""},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":" 221 \"I wondered about that. It was to be part of my next question regarding the coming 'changes'. Can you tell us where in the world the so-called 'safe areas' will be?

Monitor continued. ” Thus, the area which we gave you (Arizona) will be an area you will seek to harmonize. There is a small area of the 'Red Mountains' (a descriptive term for a mountain range near Sonora in Arizona) in which you will seek to harmonize ev entually,\" he told me. \"Also there are other areas that, at this present time, are not (exactly) appeali ng to the comforts of the body-structure,\" he said, meaning regions that - at this point in time prior to the Earth changes - are area of extreme cold (the Arctic and Antarctic) and to areas that are under the oceans at this time. \"The areas of calamity will be the tips of the Earth masses now, so you will look to islands that will be disappearing. . . and to the Earth that will be raised from the ocean bottoms. “ \"You will find that, as the calamities occur, vibrational changes upon the land will create a madness in the mind. . . and areas of human turning upon human will be great. ” \"In your seeking, we would say that the ar eas given previously are still those that will undergo great change.\" This was the first hint from Monitor of the psychological trauma that will sweep across nations as the 'changes' begin.

And where might he hide in safety from the lethal bombardment of solar and cosmic radiation once the Earth's magnetic shield is down? These had been my fears when, many years ago, I first became aware of the potential for disaster. I somehow intuitively knew that events of devastating proportions would strike the Earth during my lifetime and - through some quirk of nature - I kept 'seeing' the results of ongoing catastrophes over and over in my mind. Sometimes these visions would be in dreams. . . other times as intuitive flashes. Often, I would see a picture of future devastation around me, but the cause of the destruction was usually obscure. Other times I would see the land ravaged th rough the use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides as they filtered into our soil and water resources.

In spite of these 'visions', I have never cons idered myself to be particularly 'psychic'. My prophetic dreams have been something I have taken for granted. To me, they are not fantasies of my mind, but inevitable conclusions based on current geological data, events, trends, and the ongoing practices of politicians, world leaders, religious leaders, businessmen, and the vested interests of gross individuals throughout the world. Few, if any, of these people have any concern, for either the future of this planet, or for the ordinary people who dwell upon it.

Panic-stricken people began running out into the streets as gas lines ruptured and multiple fires - ignited by downed hydro lines - raged towards the downtown area of the city.

Therefore individuals will be able to govern that which is set for the body's deterioration (and) therefore, the concept of 'time' will be eroded.\" \"Eroded or erased?\" I asked him. \"Eroded first. . . then erased.\" \"Does this mean there will be no measurement of ‘ time ’ ?\" I asked, \"or that there will be no apparent relationship between lineal measurements and ‘ time ’ ?\" \"There will be no measurement,\" he replied. \"How ever, there will be no concern, for there will be no need for ‘ time ’ to be the governing factor of all things.\" He paused briefly before continuing. \"Those who undergo the change will, indeed, hold to Earth life. In our communication, at the start of this communication, we informed you that we are 'More of Earth than you are'. And now you understand why we commenced with this comment for we are able to enjoy all of the dimensions of Earth. And, indeed, when the changes have taken place - and Earth is once more in harmony and mankind is aware of his true self - you will i ndeed be 'Earth-beings'. And you will enjoy all the dimensions of Earth and hold onto Earth's life in all of its dimensions.

He painted a picture of total awareness of the Earth, and all of the dimensions that exist as part of it. Most of which, it would seem, we are presently totally unaware of at th is stage of our development. He was telling us that 'time' will no longer rule our lives . . . that it will slowly be eroded and then - later - erased completely. But what of Freewill? What if we have no desire to stay and enjoy the fruits of this Earthly paradise once the changes have passed? Will we still have to remain within the total surroundings that are presently Earth? The answer, of course, is 'No'. Only those who choose to stay will remain. All others who have reached a state of sufficient refinement, may pass through the dimensional gates and go to wheresoever they wish to go. They may, if they so desire, return to their source of origin, or go on to either tranquil worlds or those with turbulent, and perhaps, more challenging goals. - * - * - * - While man has remained trapped within the confines of Earthly space, he has constantly reached out in an attempt to contact (what he believes to be) some omnipotent deity he believes is ‘ God', oblivious of the fact that he is blessed with the Universal Gift of Freewill - and is solely in charge of his own life and destiny. There is no ‘ divine being ’ judging, directing, or otherwise controlling our lives. We are each in charge of our own destiny, for the Soul-Spirit that lies within each of us is a part of the ‘ One-ness That Is All ’ ! I asked Monitor why this is so. Why we are forever using prayer to reach out and grasp at the straws of unreality? Is this, I asked him, really necessary? \"It is a necessary exercise to bring the mind into quiet concentration,\" he replied. \"However,"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":" 227 the necessity, of which you speak and understand, is something that man has imposed upon himself.

It is that which you do not do that is governed. To bring the mind into harmony with the One-ness of All is not something one mind can impose upon another. It is, rather, that which the mind, the soul, the spirit will do for itself.\" \"I am appalled by the seeming hypocrisy of 'c ollective prayer',\" I told him. \"I see people attending their various places of worship on a once-a- week basis to pray to their God. Most of these church or temple goers preach about 'the brotherhood of man'. . .peace to the world. . . compassion. . . and consideration for their fellow human beings.

He begs for good fortune, a better life, more wealth, greater happiness, better health - and for all the other things he sees as representing 'the bounties of life' - because he is positive he can't alter his own past, and is not one hundred percent sure his God is ready to allow him a future that will smile upon his ways. This is why man prays. The irony of this is that - more often than not - the future is better known to us than our past! ” Monitor agreed with this little known truth. \"To those who seek with critical intellect, we would say that this is affirmative,\" he responded. \"You must understand that, in your enquiring, there is no past and no future. There is merely a change of dimension. All that has happened - and all that will happen - is obtainable to each and every individual who will condition himself to accept this truth and re-awaken his mind,\" he said. \"When we are talking of the future, we are talking of a direction,\" I said. \"And if we are able to change this direction, then we can also change the future. Is this correct?\" \"We wish you to keep this in mind, \" he replied. \"For it is our wish you to help with this change. This is the reason we are in communication with you.\" \"Then through me you are attempting to change the future?\" I asked, with a note of deep scepticism in my voice. \"We are attempting to educate mankind as to the Earth changes that will take place, and also to enable mankind to continue - in harmony - wi th these changes.

Although it appears to be little more than a simple preservation device this tiny nodule (the ‘ R-complex ’ ) is an emotional trigger of enormous magnitude. Not only is it a doorway to an incredibly wide range of feelings and emotions . . . but throughout the entire history of mankind it has also been the single, most important factor in shaping man ’ s behaviour and destiny! It is the root cause of more emotional conflicts, upheavals, and grief than all of the other factors combined. Everything from petty squabbles to jealous rages, territorial disputes to murder, power struggles to World Wars can be set in motion this tiny reptilian brain. It can trigger greed, hate, lust and every other vile emotion in man the way a detonator can trigger a bomb. Yet, before we condemn it out of hand, it is important to understand that each and every aspect of human behaviour - be it good, bad or indifferent - is an experience.

Some chose the dolphin species , many more selected the hominid creature as being the most advanced form of life on the planet through which they could ‘ experience ’ a physical reality. After a few trial runs, they quickly learned that their host-vehicles were both easy to ‘ possess ’ and meld with, and not too difficult to control. The creature also had a fair range of primitive emotions that could be tapped, thereby allowi ng them to share - albeit vicariously - all the feelings and experiences it went through during its relatively short life on Earth. When it died - or was killed while hunting or doing battle for territory with its fellow hominoids - they not only experience the pain, agony and fear it felt - but, onc e it had died, they were able to leave the body and find other, younger specimens to meld with . . .sometimes even entering the new host-vehicle at the moment it left the womb in order to experience the emotions an infant goes through when it first enters the world."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":" 232 The result of this first alliance between the Hominoid and disincarnate-Alien-beings was to be far-reaching, for this is how ‘ Mankind ’ - as we know it - was born.

But as time went by, and more and more different physical emotions were shared with their hosts, many of these diverse ethereal beings became addicted to the Third dimensional reality and began to invent new variations of each experience in an effort to top the last.

To say, as so many ‘ experts ’ keep telling us, that we are over populated is the understatement of both the 20th and 21 st centuries! But will these population figures have any bearing on the vibrational levels of the population of this planet? I believe they will. As earlier prophesied in ‘ The Skull Speaks ’ , the vibrational levels within the proximity of our Earth are now perceptibly slowing down as we slide in towards the magnetic polarity reversal that will precipitate the Earth changes. And, as the 'changes' draw ever closer, the vibrational frequency around us lessens to the point where the soul-spirits of man become more and more contaminated with 'matter' allowing the primal-core to overri de his higher reasoning powers and take over his mind. The denser the population the greater the levels of stress. When the numbers reach the stage of critical mass - and they are already beyond that level now - brother will be pitted against brother, sister against sister, friend against friend and, within no time at all, the rivalry for turf and dominance will escalate into a series of bloody wars.

For those of Like-Mind, eventual peace, tranquillity and paradise may exact a very high price-tag indeed. - * - * - * - I had accumulated a number of questions I wanted to pose to Monitor. Some had emerged as a result of answers he had already given, while others were imbedded in my mind waiting for his words to set them free. \"There are a few more general questions I'd like to ask you,\" I began, \"and the first one concerns those who will survive the 'changes'. What w ill they need to take into the future by way of knowledge, skills, experience, etcetera?\" \"You will need to take as much knowledge as you are able from those who will come to you offering their knowledge,\" he replied. \"All (knowledge) must be verified as to its understanding and accuracy. You will need to take from the past that which you have understood to be the essence of good.\" \"This is a decision to be made by the Like-Minds collectively?\" I asked. \"This is affirmative.\" I moved to the next question. \"During the process of abduction by other aliens - or even by yourselves, for that matter - it seems that small samples of flesh are taken from the abductees. Is this part of your 'searching for genetic links', or is there some other devious reason for doing this?\""},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":" 245 \"There are those who are interested, as we have previously stated, in the dominance of Earth's beings. And there are those who would seek to duplicate that of an Earth-being but without the soul,\" he explained. \"We are informed, from time to time, by The Council, that there are others who come to Earth with such practices but we feel that it is not the exercise that Earth was intended to undergo and, therefore, intervention takes place. ” \"Those who have come in peaceful purposes to study our own will not cause harm.\" \"But when you (Pleiadians) come to this pl anet you have said you manifest in whatever shape or form you feel is acceptable to those you contact. Is this correct?\" \"This is correct.\" He replied. \"If you visit a child, for example, you would assu me a form that would be least frightening to the child. Might that be in the guise or form of the 'Little People'? Like Elves, Fairies ? “ I asked. \"That which we find within the child's mind is the form in which we would appear,\" he replied. \"And when you appear to a child, what is your purpose? What are you trying to communicate to the child?\" I asked. \"It is to enable the mind to 'keep the door open',\" he replied. \"Otherwise the door to remembering will be closed fast by the critical intellect. \"Each and everyone who has a mission here upon Earth has had contact as a child, and therefore, the mind - however slowly it may appear the door opens - has always been kept open.\" \"Would you have abducted the child at that stage?\" I asked. \"This is not necessarily so.\" \"Was I contacted as a child?\", I asked, recalling one of the most vivid and lasting memories of an incident that occurred when I was around five years old. \"Indeed!\" He replied. \"There was more than one occasion when you were very aware of"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":" 246 that which would not have been considered 'normal' in your world. However, in the world of a child it was extremely normal. It is not necessary to abduct bodily those whose minds were open and still aware of the 'Source'.\" \"There have been many abductees in recent times who, during the course of an 'examination', have had some small, round, object inserted within the deep recesses of their nasal passages. Are you aware of this and, if you ar e, can you give us an explanation for it?\" \"We are aware of this.\" \"Then what is it, and what is it for?\" \"A monitoring device,\" he replied. \"Much as you would monitor your wildlife.\" \"I guess some of us are pretty wild,\" I quipped. \"It seems that some have taken more time to outgrow their grossness,\" he rejoined. I laughed, and we left it at that. - * - * - * - Many other issues were discussed in great detail, and many solutions were given but, due to the impact some of the solutions would have upon the more irrational and militant factions of our society, Monitor felt it would be wise for me to with hold such information until a more propitious time. The Gross-Beings of the world it seems are far more interested in blocking any and all solutions to the problems they have created rather than looking for ways to solve them . And this holds especially true if there is a remote they might lose a few dollars , or - even worse - some degree of control over those involved in the problem-making process. The vested interests of certain G-B ’ s are both vast and various in nature, and many of the solutions The Monitors have to offer would undoubtedly be viewed as a threat to their various power-structures and the many empi res they have built around them."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":" 247 Monitor went on to say: \"You must understand that the entire group-purpose of the Gross-Beings is to keep planet Earth in darkness.\" \"I understand completely,\" I replied. \"However, the times of the 'changes' will shake loose their hold upon this small dark planet, for indeed, it was not meant to be thus. We will give you that which you have been seeking. \"Planet Earth was to have been the twin and in ter-dimensional 'home from home' of the planet we have described before. It was to have been the exact replica of the 'Blue Planet' - the planet you have described as a 'Garden of Eden' - for it was harmonious to all things. . . to ALL life- forms. And, indeed, it enjoyed that reputation. However, when the 'changes' occurred, it became a synthesized-version of the original, a copy without a soul and without a true dimension. It became a poor imitation of a work of Art. \"Indeed, as it progressed, it began to lose sight of its original goal until now. But now, it is all but lost. This is the true destiny of planet Earth and this destiny will be fulfilled. Even the globe itself - like those upon it - has gone through many a purific ation, and soon you will see the emergence of this reflection. For Earth will reflect, in true essence, the Blue Planet.\" I continued the discussion, leading Monitor into developing further the subject of other life- forms upon this planet. I was anxious to lear n more about how they had developed over the centuries and whether they had ever interacted with mankind. I began the questioning as follows. \"I would now like to ask you about the people you earlier said live within the Earth and beneath the oceans. Are their souls a part and parcel of our ‘ soul-system ’ , the system in which our souls are currently trapped?\" I asked. \"Who are these people who exist within the Earth and Oceans?\" \"There are two or more dimensional forces here,\" he replied. \"There are those that"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":" 248 'manifest' - much as you do - but they are not from t he same civilization. At the time of the 'change' they sought to go into the Earth, and much as a ball-within-a-ball rotates, they were trapped within the Earth. They altered their vibrational force to exist within the Earth and now only in their memory banks do they have knowledge of an outside world.\" \"Where did they come from originally?\" I asked. \"They were from other galaxies.\" \"But their souls are still trapped within the Earth's magnetic field. Is this correct?\" \"This is correct. However, they would have to come back into the life-energy of the Earth - upon the Earth - before obtaining their true release.\" \"So their stages of soul-refinement would lead them back upon the Earth into human- form?\" \"This is affirmative.\" \"So they are a much lower form of vibrational level than us?\" I asked. \"It is a denser form and, therefore, not compatible with that of reflected light.\" \"Do we now have - or have we ever had - any form of interaction with these beings?\" \"This is affirmative.\" \"How long ago?\" \"This is not measured in your 't ime'. We would advise you that interaction is still practised in parts of the Earth with which you are not aware.\" \"Did they ever exist on the Earth before they went underground?\" I asked. \"These were 'beings' upon the Earth.\" Our myths and legends abound with tales of various ‘ Nether-worlds', those dark subterra- nean dwelling places where elves, goblins and monsters live in underground kingdoms.

I wanted to pursue this subject further but Carole - who had been in a trance-telepathic state for almost two hours - was beginning to show si gns of distress.

In the main, it will be the Like-Minds who will su rvive simply because it is mainly they who are sensitive enough to heed the warning. The G-B ’ s, for the most part, will not only ridicule what has been written here, but - to their peril - they will also ignore it. Part of the information we have received gives an insight as to where in the world the so- called 'safe areas' will be once the changes begin. If you will recall, Monitor responded that such places have been given in the past by several of our 'sages and seers'. As the reader is no doubt aware, there has been much written, published and produced in film-documentary form regarding Armageddon, the Apocalypse and the coming Earth changes, and - in nearly all formats - a remarkable similarity and consistency emerges that enables us to form an idea as to the events that will occur and what all L-MPs should be prepared to do if they wish to survive. In ‘ The Skull Speaks ’ , we were informed that there will be a number of 'Light Centres' in the world: Neutral areas where people will be relatively safe from the effects of major seismic upheavals, mega-storms, flooding, and inundation from tsunamis around the oceans of the world. However, we have not been informed as to exactly where these centres are to be found. There have been a number of excellent books written that deal, in great depth, with many of"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":" 251 the predictions concerning the coming Earth changes. Several of them deal with the prophecies made by modern seers and give an insight into where they believe the areas of great destruction will lie. However, it is difficult to tell just how many of these later forecasters have been influenced by the earlier predictions of a Cheiro, Conan Doyle, Nostradamus, Edgar Cayce, and so many other “ Prophets of Doom ’ , but it does appear a general consensus has emerged as to when the changes will begin, and where the Earth will be hit the hardest. Most of the latter day ‘ psychic-seers ’ have also warned of the seismic upheavals and tidal inundations, yet none of them - as far as I have read, seen or heard - seem aware of the Cosmic and Solar radiation hazards that will occur once the magnetic field is reversed. We have been forewarned of the potential for disaster. . .informed that it lies only a short time away. . .and been repeatedly warned of the inevitable consequences once the Earth changes begin. Yet ALL of these warnings are meaningless unless we are prepared to do something about such advanced knowledge before it is too late.. The Monitors are all who will both listen to - and heed - their warnings. Furthermore, they will continue to feed advanced technical information to any like-minded people capable of translating it into action. Why? Because our losses will also be their losses for they are - as they have told us - genetically linked to many of Earth's people. As already pointed out in earlier chapters, those who will be at greatest risk will be the people living on islands or in low-lying coastal areas, for there will be little protection against the surge of mega-tsunamis that may well measure in excess of 300 feet in height from trough to crest. There will be little or no warning to those on shore as these tidal waves race across oceans with devastating speed to drive inland for hundreds of miles. Mega-power earthquakes - measuring 10.00 to 15.00 (or even higher) on the Richter Scale - will trigger major landslides in mountainous areas, flatten skyscrapers, hospitals, schools and other buildings in scant seconds,"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":" 252 regardless of how well they have been ' quake-proofed' by architects and engineers.

The collective population of any large city can be likened to a fetus in its mother's womb, for - just as the fetus must rely one hundred percent on an umbilical cord for its life-sustenance - so must any large city depend on a ‘ two-way conduit ’ to function. Be it by way of air, rail, sea, lakes, canals, waterways, power lines, water and gas lines, or any other means conceived by man, ALL cities require incoming power and products in order to survive in the form of fuels, food and other life-support materials, plus they also require an out- going system to remove waste, sewage, and other garbage to keep them from being buried alive in refuse. Nearly all mega-cities in the world rely on electrical power, water and gas supplies from sources that are located beyond the boundaries of the city's limits which means that - just like the fetus in the womb - if the 'feeder system' breaks down ( i.e. the umbilical cord to the fetus is damaged or severed ) then all life within the support system will die . It is this primitive ‘ herd-instinct ’ that brings vast numbers of people together in one place that over countless centuries has slowly led to the destruction of the very resources on which the human and animal kingdom depends for their bas ic survival. Each and every large town or city has become a colossal drain on the natural resources that lie within range of readily transportable supplies.

All major cities in the world are are totally out-of-kilter with the balance of nature and the environment and - collectively - have done more to destroy this planet than any other contrivance known to man. The shame of it all is that the majority of people who dwell in these monstrous urban developments neither realize the damage that is being done, nor really care about the consequences of their actions. They sinc erely believe that it is not their personal problem but is the responsibility of their gover nment. If they live in a democratic society, the citizens believe (if they think at all) that it is not their problem, but the problem of the politicians they voted into office... the government that won the last election... and the bureaucrats and civil servants who are being paid gross amounts of money to run all things of importance safely and smoothly with the revenue levied through taxes from all but the truly wealthy citizens of the land. Regrettably, there are precious few city dwellers who fully comprehend the ramifications of their actions when they choose to live in a large city . In agriculture, the term ‘ good husbandry', means a great deal more than just its dictionary definition. It means to maintain, save, nurture, protect and care for the land from which one's very existence is derived. A farmer must return to the soil that which is removed from it. Failure to do so results in soil depletion with the loss of organic compounds and nutrients that give life to the earth.

In North America, within less than 25 years after the beginning of the 20th century U.S. and Canadian prairie wheat farmers had reduced between thirty and forty feet of some of the richest, most fertile prairie topsoil on the North American continent, down to a scant few inches of dust! 8 . How? By applying a process known as 'monoculture' . . . a method of growing the same crop (in this case it was mainly wheat) on the same rich prairie land, year after year after year after year! Not content with this form of destruction, they brought in huge combine-harvesters to cut the grain and separate the wheat from the chaff and straw . However, instead of ploughing the precious organic materials contained in the straw and chaff back into the land where it was needed to (a) help replenish the inorganic elements and (b) help rebuild the organic components in the soil - they burned it! And if these actions weren ’ t irresponsible and stupid enough, they next went out to their local Suppliers and bought chemical fertilizers to replace the inorganic elements they had just removed from the land! . As a direct result of these actions, the unprotected top soil rapidly turned to dust which, in turn, created vast 'dust bowl' areas that were systematically eroded by the wind and rain as it swept across the ravaged land. Within a matter of just a few years, the prairie farmers - encouraged by their respective governments and international Chemiical companies to produce more and more wheat - had robbed both nations of much of their agricultural future as they continued to rape our precious earth for the easily won profits of the day.

Today, in South America, South East Asia and the coastal regions of British Columbia, man continues to decimate the rain forests by way of clear-cutting or slash-and-burn techniques. Deforestation is robbing the planet of oxygen, causing widespread soil depletion in Russia, India, Africa, Pakistan, Nepal, China, Indonesia, Australia and the Americas . . .and, for every acre shorn of cover, comes the inevitable flooding and destruction of the land.

We, as human beings, are here in physical form because we chose to come to this planet a zillion years ago. We are what we are because we created ourselves with our own thought-patterns: We exist because we manifested ourselves into the reality of physical existence in the body-structure form we believed we needed for this particular incarnation. Why? Because we wished to experience a specific aspect of physical reality we are unable to taste or know in Soul-Spirit form . That, in a nutshell, is it. Nothing more, nothing less. This mode of life was originally intended to be a means of extending the knowledge and scope of our soul-spirits in a never-ending quest for ultimate perfection.

I asked Monitor about the various 'divisions of dimensions' and how each is both determined and accessed. He told me that he had already communicated this to me and suggested I go back through these communications to research it. \"We have indicated in the past that we were more of the planet Earth than you. You must understand that your planet like others is inter-dimensional, therefore it is accessed by the state of the mind. There are not, as you would understand, one, two, three, four, and so on dimensions, but it is an awakening of the mind that allows one to perceive different dimensions for, as we have shown you, All is One.\""},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":" 262 \"Yes, I understand,\" I told him. \"But you have also shown me that a dimension is a vibrational level.\" \"The mind is able to access ALL dimensional levels, ” he said. \"It is not governed by the personality unless that personality be (that) of the Gross Being, for their minds cannot vibrate sufficiently (high) to pierce the barriers.\" \"But isn't it true that many G-B ’ s were once people of a higher vibrational level than they are now, and it was only when they came to Earth and indulged in pursuits 'of the flesh' that they became G-B ’ s and their vibrational levels dropped?\" I asked. \"They were (at) a different vibrational level,\" he explained. \"When you say 'higher' you mean of a 'spiritual' aspiration. They were not of a higher level - they were of a differen t dimensional level . \"When we say different, you must understand that, just as one can go higher, so one can go lower and still be in a dimension not of the Third,\" he explained. \"Planet Earth is the only dimension into which - as the result of a catastrophe - the dimension itself has been trapped in matter . In all others one is able to cross these barriers. However, it should be understood that it is not just the crossing of the barrier that makes a being (rise to a) a higher degree.\" \"Whether it is higher or lower is merely a matter of degree, isn ’ t it? The point I'm trying to make is that it IS a different level , isn't it?\" I asked him. \"This is affirmative,\" he replied. \"All I'm trying to ascertain is at which vibrational levels do various dimensions exist?\" \"We will seek to explain further.\" Monitor paused again as he sought answers to my questions. In a moment he returned. \"When that of the Gross Being is finished wi th the body, the body deteriorates and the G-B remains at the level of the Third dimension where it is very easily perceived - often in a disruptive way - even by those whose minds are not open to inter-dimensional perceptions,\" he explained."},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":" 263 \"Are you speaking of the poltergeist phenomena?\" I asked. \"This is affirmative,\" he replied. \"There is not a 'division', as you would understand it. However, those who will read your words and be inst ructed by them will still cling to the idea of a division, even though we have shown you that what is, and was . . . and will be . . . are perceived as the 'One' when the mind is free.\" To me, this concept is not an easy one to grasp. If, indeed, All is One - and can be perceived as such once the mind is free - then why are there so many dimensions or dimensional levels? If the Nth dimension is the dimension where the Essence of Pure Energy exists and the Third dimension is where matter is created then at which dimensional level does that of the ' ONE-NESS ' exist? Frankly, I don't know. Monitor has suggested that I review his communications in order to discover the answer (which I have done many times) but I have a sneaki ng suspicion that I am not yet ready for full enlightenment on many of the areas he has covered. Having said that, I shall now wait for the truth to dawn. - * - * - * - \"At the start of these communications you said you would try to make yourselves known to me in a physical sense. So far this hasn't happened,\" I told him. \"We have been informed that you are still looking for Third dimensional proof of our existence,\" he replied. \"Therefore we have decided t hat your proof will be such that you will never again doubt our existence. \"When your mind is ready - and will not be damaged - we will make ourselves known to you as brother to brother. . . one to one. This, as we perceive your future time, will be in a very short space of time.\""},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":" 264 \"Thank you, I shall look forward to it,\" I told him. “ My reason for asking. . . Monitor cut across my words. \"Your reason for asking is that you are desirous of knowing once and for all that your mind is not in a state of disruption.\" \"That, in part, is correct, but there is another, equally compelling reason. The channel through whom you are presently communicating (Car ole) and I are - quite literally - putting our necks on the chopping block with this book. Once it is published, both of us will be right out front facing the firing squad. A confirmatory sighting would be most reassuring and help convince me I'm not stark, raving, mad!\" \"We noted this and, as explained before your question was asked, this is why we have arranged proof that will be affirmative to you,\" he told me. \"You must understand that it is within the nature of (your) personality that - even if we were to come face to face with you at this time. . . at this moment. . . or in moments to come - you would again doubt yourself and the mind. \"Therefore we will arrange for your sighting. And your perception (of it) will leave you totally aware that you have, indeed, made contac t (with us ) and that your mind is safe.\" When that time comes, I can only hope that he is right on all counts! - * - * - * - The Pleiadians and other more advanced aliens have developed their technology and philosophical belief systems over countless eons of time. They mastered inter-dimensional and inter-galactic 'space' travel after they discovered the secret of a process that lies within the realm of vibrational mechanics ; a feat which, by comparison, would be similar in magnitude to our physicists and engineers combining together to harness the atom once they had discovered the underlying principle that exists behind the E = mc 2 equation."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":" 265 It is this ability to mechanically raise or lower the electromagnetic-vibrational levels of the field/shields around their space vehicles that enables the occupants of a Space-Vehicle (UFO) to enter - at will - into other dimensions. Having once accomplished this, they then discovered the ‘ timeless ’ quality of the dimension and found that once removed from the density of the Third dimension - in no time at all - they were able to travel anywhere in the Universe! However, we on Earth are constantly reminded by our physicists and astro-physicists that, because of the enormity of the distances between solar systems and galaxies, we are physically restrained within the confines of our solar system and, moreover, because of this alien visitors cannot exist. These presumptions are, of course, based on Einsteinian logic which states that the speed of light is absolute. . . inviolable. . . therefore all distances within the Universe are subject to the restriction of Time as measured by the speed of light. This means that the distance between solar system 'X' and 'Y' must be measured by the time it takes light (at 186,000 miles per second) to travel between them. But, as pointed out earlier in this book, the rules governing Time and the speed of light apply only to the Third dimension . Beyond this boundary lie other laws, other parameters, in which the restrictions of Time and the speed of light no longer exist. - * - * - * - "},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":" 266 XXV =========================== PYRAMIDS - FINAL NOTES - AND THEN ADIEU A part of the UFO phenomena that continues to puzzle some observers is the ability of the craft to suddenly disappear right in front of their eyes, then - after a moment or two - to re-appear a short distance away. The answer to this mystery is relatively simple. By mechanically (or electro-magnetically) raising the vibrational frequency of the field around the outer skin of the craft, it is able to reach the vibrational level of the next dimension . Once this level is reached, the UFO simply 'slides' out of the Third dimension and, quite literally, disappears into the next dimension interfacing with ours. To reverse the procedure, the vibrational frequency is slowed to the point where it re- appears in the time-frame zone of the Third dimension. Inter-dimensional navigation was a challenge that had to be overcome by any Alien beings before they were able to use other dimensions through which they could conquer inter- galactic travel - arrive at a hitherto unknown destination - and then find their way home. They immediately discovered that once they were in another dimension - where time and distance and had no meaning - there were no navigational ‘ points ’ to which location references could be applied. As a result, they were compelled to find another approach that would enable them to navigate their way both to, and from, specific destinations in a timeless and featureless void simply by creating location beacons at any point in the Universe once they had arrived. These beacons could then be used as navigational aids to guide them through a Time-less dimension to wherever they chose to go. If this really was the answer, then what sort of beacons"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":" 267 did they build on various planets and how were they able to function as ‘ homing-points ’ to the first inter-dimensional travellers? These were a few of the problems I pondered until it suddenly dawned on me that, perhaps, these first ‘ Star People ’ may have developed a self-generating - self-sustaining - inter- galactic/inter-dimensional 'beacon' which, when erected on the surface of any given planet, would serve as vibrational beacon between one dimension and another in much the same way a radio signal is used to give bearings to ships and aircraft using OMNI navigational equipment. To distinguish one planet from another in an endless, time-less void it would be necessary for each vibrational signal to contain coded information that would enable the navigator to instantly recognise each planet they wished to return to in a special way. Such a signal would include a set of signal codes that might include the actual physical dimensions of the planet, vibrational and rotational speeds, plus any electromagnetic data that might be unique to a specific planet out of several zillion others in our Third dimensional Universe. The question remains: Do such beacons exist on planet Earth? The answer of course, is ‘ Yes ’ . . . in several locations! There is one key structure here on Earth that fits all of the requirements needed to act as an inter-dimensional navigational beacon to inter-dimensional travellers and that is The Great Pyramid of Giza! Not only do the physical dimensions of the Great Pyramid equate exactly to scale with the equatorial and polar dimensions of planet Earth, but the structure itself is also capable of both generating , storing, and supplying on demand - enormous amounts of electromagnetic energy in a totally self-sustaining way. At the time the Great Pyramid was completed, its outer casing (or sheath) was made from Oriental alabaster - a variety of white calcite - which not only turned the structure into a magnificent monument sheathed in marble-like cover, but also transformed it into an enormous"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":" 268 electrical capacitor - or ‘ battery ’ - through which electromagnetic energy could be both generated and stored until it reached the point of saturation. A t this point, the electromagnetic energy would be discharged into the heavens through the apex of the capstone creating an extremely powerful electro-vibrational field. It was this electro-magnetic field that was able to penetrate the dimensional barrier, creating - as it did so - an inter-dimensional 'beacon' that could reach into the 'Time-Less' dimension thereby reaching everywhere in the Universe at once. All that an advanced space- traveller's navigational instrumentation need do to locate ‘ Planet Earth ’ would be to read the signal-pattern from the Great Pyramid, for, in effect, it as able to say: ‘ This is Planet Earth: 40,074.156 units around the equator; 9,942.209 units around the poles for these precise measurements are embodied in the base-height dimensions of the Great Pyramid itself! Possibly the only other thing an inter-dimensional navigator might need to know is that the planet rotates around its own axis at a rate of 24 units and does this 365.62299 times during one complete orbit al rotation of its sun. With this simple yet detailed information, Inter-terrestrial or Inter- galactic navigators could readily find the planet they are looking for out of all the billions of other planets in the Universe! To further locate other places on this planet, there are a variety of other pyramid-type structures, obelisks, stele and other electro-magnetic generating-storage mounds that could readily be coded to pinpoint their exact locations to any and all advanced navigators. To an advanced race of Star-People trying to navigate the Time-Less Dimension to this minuscule sub-sector of the Universe, it would be comparatively easy to locate any planet in the Universe upon which some intelligent beings had built these pyramid-beacons. It is even possible that the dimensions of the pyramid reportedly found on Mars might also have measurements that match - to scale - the equatorial and polar measurements of the Red Planet. If this is so, then it, too, may well be a navigational beacon to our next door neighbour and prove"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":" 269 conclusively that it, too, was once inhabited by intelligent forms of life. All of this was pure conjecture on my part at the time I posed the question to Monitor. I explained to him that it was no more than an idea - just an intuitive flash. \"Was this an 'insight' or a 'memory'?\" He asked, somewhat teasingly. \"I have no idea,\" I replied. \"You tell me.\" I went on to explain a small part of the theory and then asked the key question. \"Is the Great Pyramid of Giza a 'beacon' used for inter-dimensional travel by your Spaceships?\" I asked. \"This is correct,\" he replied. \"A pyramid, as you perceive it, alters the magnetic field and vibrational level of wherever it is placed.\" \"And this can be 'seen' - or perceived - from other dimensions, just as a lighthouse or beacon would be seen by a ship in the dark?\" I asked. \"This is affirmative. It makes a pattern that is perceived by our vessels, for our vessels are, as you would understand, a 'living mind' unto themselves.\" \"It follows, then, that if one or more pyramids have been used on this planet as navigational 'points', then other pyramids must have been built on other planets. Is this correct?\" \"This is affirmative,\" he responded. \"Are we to assume that the Great Pyramid is of little or no value to the inhabitants of Earth (other than intrinsic and historical) but does have great value to you in the dimension in which you now exist?\" I asked. \"This is not quite correct,\" he replied. \"The value of the pyramid in this dimension is that it works as a safeguard or barrier in altering frequencies and in stabilizing frequencies and magnetic fields that we are able to use for your protection.\" His words triggered visions in my mind of the planet's surface after the magnetic shield has collapsed."},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":" 270 \"What effect will the cosmic and Solar radiation have on human, animal, insect and plant life?\" I asked. \"Will it be lethal?\" \"We are aware that it will, for some, have the effect of ceasing Third dimensional life,\" he replied. \"But there will be those who will be protected, should they choose to be protected.\" \"I have a hunch - a feeling - that the magnetic field-shield will not be 'switched off' for very long,\" I said. \"Possibly only a short while; a day, maybe. . . or even just two.\" It was a rather obvious ploy to draw a time frame from Monitor but, as usual, it failed. \"We, at this point, find your information to be slightly incorrect,\" he replied. \"For you understand it as a 'change', whereas we would inform you that we will block and protect the Earth life forms as best we can. Therefore we are unable to be specific at this time. Where you to regard this as a 'switching off', we would inform you that it will be blocked by our protection.\" \"Yet we will nevertheless still lose the Van Allen Radiation Belts from around the planet when the field collapses, won't we?\" \"There will be much disruption and change in this area. This is affirmative,\" he replied. \"I won't ask you to describe the actual 'physics' of what will occur - this is something for another time, another book. . . \" \"We would remind you to look backward into the history of the Earth for there you will find (an understanding of) many of the changes that will occur and have already begun to occur within planet Earth.\" I told him that I have already spent a great deal of time doing research into the geological past of the planet, but much of our 'history' is limited to the inexactitude of our science itself. There are many opposing theories concerning certain per iods of the past, and many new findings that would challenge past concepts and thinking. Monitor understood my predicament and offered a simple experiment that involved the interaction between crystal and electromagnetic energy and sound vibrations which, at this time, I"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":" 271 won't go into. I explained to him that, until such time as this book is finished and published, I would have little time to carry out the various experiments he had passed on to me. I went on to explain that we were nearing the end of this book and that the time had come for The Monitors, The Council, and himself, to pass on any pertinent information they felt necessary before concluding this last session. I asked if he foresaw another book as a continuance of this one. \"There must always be a passing on of information and direction. When the searching mind asks the question; 'Will the Teachers come to bring information and enlightenment?' - it will always find an answer.\" \"I understand,\" I said. \"As we have previously stated, we have at this point begun a communication with you to assure you of the continuance of inter-dimensional life on planet Earth,\" he told me. \"We came to feed and give information for your protection and your well-being. We came in answer to your request. \"We have told you that, in the beginning, it was desirous that planet Earth was to be a duplicate of a planet that was lost, and we also explained to you how the planet was to be used as a vehicle of learning and study in many dimens ions. We have also explained to you that Earth was to be entered into the Federation, but because it was used by many, its growth was slow. \"At the time of the collapse of the duplicate planet, the dimension gates were closed almost to a point of non-existence thereby trapping all forms of life and communication with us within the shell and the belt (Van Allen & Magnetosphere)t of the planet Earth. Due to these disruptions we were, until recent times, very hesitant to approach Earth once again, for it had become a gross and slow vibration not willing to accept that t here were higher forms of life. \"However, in recent times, it has been perceived that those who were of the ‘ Minds of One ’ had, once again, reached a level where they were seeking and reaching outwards. Their seeking set up a dimensional wavelength through which we were able once again to open, very gently, a"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":" 272 communicative wavelength so that we could manipulate energies through which we could communicate and show ourselves to you (in the hope it would ) reawaken in your minds from whence you came. \"We have found, however, that the Gross-Beings are still in control of planet Earth. We have been warned by Council that there must be no transference of the Gross- Beings ’ minds into the Universe so, therefore, we must proceed with great caution.\" He paused for a few moments as if choosing his words very carefully. \"We were, at one time, allowed to deliver to Earth instructional Teachers and Masters who (tried to )re-established among the Like Minds that Earth was not alone within the Universe.\" Again he paused. \"They came and they sought to lead, teach and stay within the Earth's atmosphere, but you then decided that this experience was to be of a religious nature and, again, the Gross-Beings used this 'religion' to control and manipulate the populace. \"Since then, however, many Like-Minded people have become stronger, and the link with their origins has become much more established. So, therefore, our visitations and the landing of our ships and the ships of others have become, as you would understand, a reality. Even so, we proceed with great caution for we have no desire for man to turn, once again, in upon himself. \"We will use the opening of the dimensional gate and the calamities that will affect planet Earth to make our presence known in a benevolent way for the benefit of that which, it was decided, would be planet Earth.\" \"You have told us that you have been in touch with our Governments - the Governments of the world - and I would like to know just what sort of reaction you received. What, if anything, are they going to do about the coming changes, and what must we do in conjunction with them?\" I asked. \"The Governments of Earth acknowledge our presence,\" he replied. \"However, they still seek dominance and, therefore, will not enlighten other s with the information they have received.

We are here. Now it is time for you to come home!\" His voice lifted as he spoke these words and, within the echoes of my mind, I felt as if a clarion call had sounded, summoning all who would listen to heed his words. But then his voice lowered as he continued with a final warning. \"We would also inform you that there are others (other visitors) who do not seek to aid mankind upon the Earth. Look for them to be of a dominant nature, for it should be remembered that only (those who live in Peace), Love and Ha rmony respect all others, (for they) do not seek dominance in any way. Always the choice will be offered to you. Never will you be commanded nor manipulated. If you choose one path or another then the choice is yours.\" \"Thank you for everything,\" I told him. \"Au revoir until the next time.\" \"We will always remain in constant touch with your vibration,\" he assured me. \"When next we meet, it will be as face to face. You will recognize me, as I will recognize you, for you and I have travelled many a path together.\" As he spoke, I felt a strange emotion beginning to well up inside me . . .an intangible sense of purpose . . . a feeling that I somehow belonged to the Universe in a very special way.
