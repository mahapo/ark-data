You cannot expect to learn the skills while believ ing they don't exist. Skepticism is good - it keeps you from following blindly behind something that may not be right for you. Disbelief and skepticism are different, though. If you are somewhat doubtful of psychic abilities, you may wish to learn them to experience them yourself. The best way to learn is to practice an easy exercise a few times (don't start with telekinesis; start with a simpler ability). As you practice, you will feel the ability happening, and build confidence. If you want scientific p roof, check out the Journal of Parapsychology. Experiments have been done repeatedly and successfully. The main advantage to proving the abilities yourself is that you know no one prompted you with the information. It gives you a direct personal experience of the ability. Yoda explained the necessity of belief well in Star Wars: \"Do or do not. There is no try.\" BASIC SKILLS Grounding Definition Letting Go Anchoring Balancing Centering Definition Finding Center Staying Centered Centering in Crowds Making Psiballs Definition Drawing Energy Shaping Energy Common Problems Perceiving Energy Definition and Practice Common Problems "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Grounding Definition Grounding means connecting your energy and flow of en ergy to the earth in a stable, secure way. It allows you to get rid of unwanted energy, while taking in clean, balanced energy. When well grounded, you will be able to draw more energy through yourself with less trouble. Letting Go The first step is to let go of all the tension you can, relax your shoulders, calm yourself, and focus on what you are doing. Bring your attention to the current time and place. Let all the active energy you have release, and any that you don't want drain down off of you into the earth. It may feel like slowing down and taking a deep calm breath. Anchoring Now, extend your own energy down into the earth while keeping it also connected to you. This will feel like streamers or roots extending deep into the earth. These are y our anchors. They balance your energy, so you're not dizzy, and they also give and take energy to keep your overall level steady. When stressed, you may notice that you aren't anchored very well. Grounding and stabalizing your anchor will help reduce the f eelings of stress. Balancing As long as is comfortable, let your unwanted energy drain down through the anchors into the earth. Draw clean fresh energy upward through the anchors through yourself. The more strongly you are anchored, the better your ene rgy balance will be. You'll be able to let more energy flow through you smoothly, without feelings of tightness or nervousness. Any time you are working with energy, being grounded will make it easier. Centering Definition Centering means finding your own identity and essence, separate from the influences of societal expectations and pressures. It can enhance shielding, and if done well, can remove the need for shields entirely. It allows you to perceive your own energy, others' energy, and the en ergy of your environment clearly. Finding Center To begin with, finding your center will be easiest when alone. Find some quiet time, where you can be alone for at least 30 minutes. Do what you can to prevent interruptions. Turn off the tv, radio, etc; t urn off the phone ringer and let an answering machine answer instead if possible. Sit quietly for a few minutes, just breathing and noticing who you are. Pay attention to how you feel and why. Let each feeling surface and then pass on without judgement. R ecognize your stream of thought, and just let it flow. Notice how your body feels and looks, and any tension you are carrying. Notice your daydreams and ideas, any analyzing you are doing, and everything that is a part of you. Also notice anything you are feeling, tension you are carrying, or pressures or expectations, that may be imposed on you by others. Notice how you have reacted to them, and what your feelings are in response. There's no need to change"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"anything unless you want to; just be aware of the se things. Consider the things you want, separate from the things others want for you. As you do this, you will get a stronger and stronger feeling and idea of yourself. With time, you'll recognize more quickly what is a part of who you are, and what is t emporary or societal. This will help prevent empathic flooding, and increase control of energy work you do. Staying Centered in Crowds With practice, you will be able to pause for a few seconds and center yourself in almost any circumstance. If you ten d to be susceptible to empathic overload, staying centered in crowds will reduce the flooding. It may take practice to get good at, but will help significantly. Making Psiballs Definition Psiballs are balls of psychic energy. They can be any size, density, shape, texture, etc. They can be used to carry information, investigate an area, heal, warm or cool an area, or simply to play with and to practice energy control. \u0000 INCLUDEPICTURE \"http://members.uk.tripod.de/Spaceboy10/Psychic/psiball.gif\" \\ * MERGEFORMATINET \u0000\u0000\u0000 Drawing Energy You will need energy to make psiballs. Energy comes from many sources, including the sun, moon, earth, nature, water, wind, storms, fire, emotions, and movement. People carry energy with them at all times; howev er, this energy can become drained after some practice making psiballs. Because of this, having other energy sources to draw from can help you avoid getting too tired. Choose an energy source you enjoy to draw energy from. Feel energy from that source flo wing into you. You can picture it as a garden hose pouring energy into you, or as a waterfall all around you. You might picture it as light surrounding and filling you, or a fire warming you. The energy surrounds and fills you, raising your energy to a muc h stronger level. If you begin to feel lightheaded, imagine a connection into the ground to let go of the excess energy. Lightheadedness usually means that you have too much energy and need to let some of it go back into the earth, like grounding an elect rical system. As you draw energy, take only what feels appropriate. Don't force it; just gently draw the energy. Forcing it will only make it more difficult to get the right amount of energy. Shaping Energy As you draw energy, direct it outward through your hands. Cup your hands as if you were holding a baseball or a ball of cookie dough, with one hand below it and one above it. Picture the energy flowing from your body, through your arms, and out through your hands. Feel the energy swirling and buildin g up between your hands. Make the energy into a ball between your hands, making it more and more dense as you add energy. Let yourself feel the energy between your hands. Notice any push or pull between your hands, any difference in heat, changing density of the air, sparks of light, waviness of the background behind the energy ball, or anything else that changes. If you have difficulty creating a strong enough psiball to feel, try"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"drawing more energy and adding that energy to it. It may take practice to m ake a strong enough psiball to physically see, but you should be able to feel it fairly quickly. Do not worry if you only feel it, and can not see it; that is normal. You may feel a lot of heat between your hands; this means you have drawn energy through t hem properly. After you are comfortable making a psiball, try working with friends. Each person starts by creating their own psiball. Then combine all of the psiballs into the center of the circle. Each person continues to add energy to the center. After a few minutes, discuss how each person perceives the energy. As a group, try changing the temperature or the density of the energy. Practice regularly to improve your speed at creating psiballs and your control of them. As you become more comfortable maki ng them, try variations. Make shapes other than a ball; try fire, a pool of water, a crystal, and any other shape you can imagine. Try changing the temperature of the energy, making it extra warm or extra cool. Try making the energy carry different emotion s, being agitated or soothing. If you have a willing partner, try using an energy ball to tickle them. Make a large energy ball of happy energy, and cover a friend in it. If you do it with a willing friend, but at a time they don't know what's happening, you can see how strongly it affects how they feel. (This often has the effect of making the receiver very happy and bouncy, as if they've had too much sugar or caffeine.) The energy can also be used to heal; more details will be given on that later. C ommon Problems Q: I was able to make a psiball once, but it was weak and I can't do it anymore. A: Try drawing more energy to make the psiballs. Since you were able to do it once, you have the technique, just not the strength. Let things happen gentl y, without forcing them, and be sure you are adding enough energy to make a strong psiball. Q: I have drawn energy and tried to shape it, but I don't feel any energy ball forming. A: Either you are not creating an energy ball, or you cannot feel the one that is there. First of all, open up your mind to feel any sensations around the ball, no matter how small. If you feel no sensations at all, try putting much more energy into the energy ball. It may take many times the amount of energy you expected. A lso, let the energy leave your body; don't hold it in. Focus on letting go of it as it swirls around between your hands. Q: I can make an energy ball but it immediately falls apart, or just doesn't do what I want it to. A: Energy follows thought, so practice keeping your mind focused on the one thing you want the energy to do. As you practice, learn to keep your mind focused even through distractions. What you think and expect is what the energy will do, so as you practice, expect the energy ball to l ast longer and longer, until you decide to let it stop existing. You may need to continuously add energy to keep the psiball in shape. "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" Perceiving Energy Definition and Practice When you interact with energy, it is important to be able to see t he effect you are having. Energy can take many forms, and you can perceive it in many ways. Watch the color, shape, and flow of the energy. Observe where it is going and what it is doing. Listen to any sounds around it, and hear the vibration level of the energy. Feel its emotional energy, including whether it feels good or bad. As you observe it, be aware of anything you know about it that does not originate through any direct observations. Intuition will tell you about the purpose of the energy and its s uccessfulness. Touch the energy with your energy, gently, without interfering with it, and observe how it reacts. Does your energy add to it, or does your energy overpower it? Is it a good joining of energy or does one take power over the other? These obs ervations will help you understand the details of the energy, and provide you with a lot of information as you keep your mind open to receive it. Common Problems Q: I can't get enough details from the energy I'm perceiving. The information seems very vague. A: Work with all your senses to receive information. Once you get a piece of information, think about it and watch for related images and ideas. You may need to specifically formulate questions in your mind that you want answers to. These question s can be vague or specific; try to make them specific enough to get the information you want without being so specific that your thinking is limited. Keep asking for details until you get the information you are looking for. Q: I'm getting flooded with in formation; how do I handle it all? A: If you can't record the images quickly enough, let many images pass through your mind until they lessen. Then ask to be shown only the most important points. You can ask about more specific details afterward if they a re important. Q: I keep getting distracted and lose my focus. A: Gently clear your mind each time it happens, taking care not to force it. Keep reminding yourself of what you want to do, and let your mind focus on it more and more. If you are physically jittery and can't sit still, try focusing your mind while you do some exercise. Walk around in circles, ride an exercise bike, or do anything that safely occupies your body so you can focus your mind. Auras Definition What is the aura? An aura is an energy field around an object, plant, animal, or person. It contains information about the health of an organism, its emotional and mental state, and many other things. Color, texture, shape, size, and motion of the aura all provide informati on about the organism or object. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" \u0000 INCLUDEPICTURE \"http://www.imsa.edu/~jgable/library/rewrite/pracpsy/aura.gif\" \\ * MERGEFORMATINET \u0000\u0000\u0000 Seeing the Aura Relax your body, mind, and eyes. Choose an object or person to look at. (This works best wi th objects and plants to begin with because you aren't nervous about what they are thinking of you.) Look gently at the object, letting your gaze focus slightly behind the object. Don't stare; eye strain doesn't help any. Feel yourself looking with your third eye also. This is an area of the forehead that tends to be psychically sensitive. To find it, close your eyes and feel your focus shift up slightly. Open and close your eyes a few times to find this shift. Don't roll your eyes backward to look up; t his will just cause a headache. Once you are confident of where the focus shift is, try letting your focus shift up in the same way but with your eyes open. Do it gently; don't force it. This should give the sensation of looking out of your eyes and out of your mind/forehead at the same time. This shift of focus awakens psychic vision, which is used to see auras. Avoiding After - Images Look just past the object whose aura you want to see, using your eyes gently to see and keeping your focus lifted t o the third eye area, also. If you begin to see lines of color around the object, you can check to see if they are an actual aura by looking away. If you see after - images that look like the lines you saw, it's not an aura. After - images are a biological eff ect of the eyes caused by eye strain. To keep after - images from building up, blink fairly often and don't look at one thing too long. As you become better with the techniques for aura vision, you will not need to look at an object for very long to see an a ura. Don't be afraid of looking away when you think you can see an aura. If it is a real aura, it WILL be there when you look back and refocus on it. If it isn't there then, it's actually only an after - image, and looking away will clear the image out of your eyes. When you are trying to clear out the after - images, simply closing your eyes for a minute or two is an easy way to do it. When you stop seeing the image on the inside of your eyes, the image is cleared and you can go back to seeing the aura. Aura colors Auras come in many shapes, sizes, colors, and textures. There is no standard interpretation of colors because different people perceive different colors for each meaning. The best way to discover the meanings of colors is to read about var ious traditional meanings, see if any fit what you see, and use the meanings as a basis to decide what the colors mean to you. Also, observe the shape, texture, and solidity of different auras to evaluate your experiences with those things. Shape and te xture generally tend to show the attitude of the person towards other people who are standing close to them;"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"often a very sharp border and a solidly shaped aura shows someone who is decisive about how close people can be to them. Perceptions change with th e viewer, though, so you should experiment and observe to determine how to interpret certain aspects. Practice techniques As you practice seeing auras, stay relaxed and calm. Let things flow without trying to force anything. If you find you are spend ing a long time without seeing anything, relax. Often the moment you relax and quit trying, you will suddenly see the aura quite clearly. So relax, have fun, and be patient. Practice fairly often, but don't tire yourself doing it. If things aren't worki ng, take a break, do something fun, and try again later when you can be more relaxed and patient. Some people find aura vision easier when they are preparing to go to sleep because they are already relaxed and tired enough that they don't have the energy t o force things to happen. While this should never be carried to extremes, practicing aura vision at least a little bit when you are already tired can be helpful, especially if you have a difficult time letting things happen without forcing them. Being i n a slightly dim room can also be helpful so you don't strain your eyes trying to see. Having a solidly colored background behind what you are looking at can also help. The color doesn't matter, as long as it doesn't strain your eyes to look at it. Grays, whites, very dark colors, and browns work fairly well. Primarily, you want an environment that won't be visually distracting. Multiple Levels The aura is made up of multiple levels, like an onion, but with each level reaching from the very center of the person outward. Close to the body, all of the levels overlap. Each level outward reaches farther away from the body. Also, each level out becomes less dense, lighter, more subtle, and generally more difficult to see. The best way to learn to see the outer levels is to first practice seeing the inner ones, and then let your awareness become more and more expanded. You may notice yourself feeling lighter and happier as you work more and more with seeing the first level of the aura. Let more of this fee ling of lightness build in you as you try to see the second and third levels. Also, let yourself feel outward with your own aura, using the various feeling senses to observe the aura you are looking at. Let yourself become more relaxed and open as you o pen up to see the outer layers. Feel your vision shifting more strongly toward the third eye and clairvoyancy. Remain relaxed and light feeling, and your vision will expand to include the layers that are farther out, nine layers or possibly more. You ca n see, and as you are able to see more, pause and enjoy the beauty of being able to see it. Also, observe the interactions between the auras of people and those of plants and animals. Common Problems Q: I can't feel the shift in focus."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" A: Relax an d keep trying. If you still have difficulty after a lot of practice, try learning some other psychic skill first. Doing so will help you open up to viewing things psychically, which will make aura vision easier to learn. Q: I can feel a shift in focus b ut I still can't see anything. A: Try looking at different energy levels; you may be below or above what you are actually trying to see. Do this by varying the amount of energy you have in yourself, adding more or letting some go to adjust to different levels. The more you practice, the easier this becomes. INTRODUCTION: The following exercises may be used to introduce the student to the concepts and perceptive skills needed to see, feel, and manipulate the Human Energy Field or Aura. I will brie fly discuss the HEF and the relationships between the five senses and their Extra sensory counterparts known to \"Spirit Sensitives\". The brief descriptions I give may serve as a guideline for discussion with the new student but are by no means authorita tive. The universe is permeated by a field of energy and information known as the Universal Energy Field (UEF). This field is all encompassing. It is what all matter and energy are a part of. One important property of this field is that it is perfectly uni fied. Picture this: A pool of water is disturbed and the ripples take no time to form. That is all of the water is disturbed at the same time. There can be no assignment of cause and effect because the cause and the effect are not separated by time. The y may be in fact considered the same event. This is how the UEF works. Time and space are tools to perceive the UEF but it is not bound by them. I referred to the UEF as a field of energy and information. What we perceive as matter is just a \"localized\" di sturbance in this universal field. We are disturbances or \"local fields\" if you will in the UEF. When in relation to humans I will refer to the local disturbance as the Human Energy Field or Aura. People can often tell when someone is staring at them or th at they are not alone in a room. These are examples of HEF perception. With time you can learn to feel, see, and manipulate your energy field and others. In the following exercises I will use touch as the breakthrough sense because it is the most truste d sense and the easiest to demonstrate. Later visual cues will be used to enhance the students perception. If the exercises are done diligently and seriously, most student will perceive auras within a week. EXERCISE 1: DIVINING THE AURA GOAL To us e divination to demonstrate how the aura can be detected by the novice. This will build faith and speed progress. 1. Build two L - rods out of metal coat hangars. Cut a piece from a hanger that is about 20 inches long. Bend five inches at a 90 degree angl e. You should have an L shaped device at this point. The smaller segment will serve as the handle. Two of these must be made."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 2. Establish enough pressure to keep the rods pointing somewhat forward. The rods will waiver from side to side. This is normal . Next ask yourself a simple yes or no question. You may even direct the question to the rods. Now be alert and notice any movement in the rods. If the tops of your hands angle out the rods will move out and vice versa. Notice any movement and go with i t. The object here is to train yourself to recognize the response you are having to the stimulus of a question. Repeat this until your response is clear in both the positive and negative. You have just learned a simple form of divination. You can now ask y ourself yes or no questions that you don't know the answers to. Remember though that if you have a strong opinion about it your answer may be clouded. 3. Set up a subject. This can be an inanimate object or a plant but a person is preferred. Stand 15 ft away and clear your mind. Imagine that as you approach the subject the rods are repelled by its aura. (I usually demonstrate this part so that the student can see that something is definitely happening) Now walk toward the subject slowly. As soon as the r ods begin to move slow down almost to a stand still and back up. This is the beginning of your zone of sensitivity. As the rods begin to move be aware of any physical sensations you may feel. Most people feel a mild pressure or heat at the solar plexus. Yo u may even feel the beginnings of an upset stomach. Whatever the sensation, pay close attention to it. Approach the subject again and feel the sensation deeply. The rods will begin to move more quickly as you become more aware of your bodies responses. The rods will spread apart or move together as you approach the subject. When the rods point away from each other or toward each other begin to walk in a circle around the subject. Face the subject as you do this and the rods will move to conform to the shape of the subjects aura. 4. There are many variations to this exercise. You can ask the subject to try projecting her aura and watch as the rods respond or you can find people and things that you cannot physically see. Work with this until your confidence is high. Let others perform the exercise to remove any self doubt. It is easy to convince yourself that you are fudging things. 5. As you become more practised, thinking of the subject will sometimes be enough to generate a response. 1. First relax. Put your arms apart with palms facing forward. Now shift your awareness to your hands. Concentrate on the feelings in your hands. As you become aware of each finger, relax them. You are now ready to begin. 2. Begin moving your hands together in front o f you. This movement should be very slow. The object here is to move as slowly as possible so that any sensations can be felt clearly. As your hands move together notice any increases in heat or pressure. As they get closer together (about 2.5 ft) you may feel as if there is a slight increase in air pressure between them. You may also feel a warm sensation. Stop the movement and reverse just as slowly until the sensation fades, then repeat. You should be able to encounter the sensation at roughly the sam e distance each time you try it. 3. Find the sensation zone again. This time Imagine that the sensation is cause by a ball of energy or perhaps a ball of air. Move your hands around this ball"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"slowly. You will probably feel the texture of it as it passes across your fingers. At this point if you continue pushing your hands closer together the pressure and heat will increase. This is a method I use to gather localised energy for healing. Once you have become comfortable with your ability to feel the bal l of energy, run the finger of your right hand across the palm of your left hand without touching. You can feel a sort of tickle as your auric finger passes through the physical and auric palm of your left hand. Find a partner and try feeling each others a uras. EXERCISE 3: IMAGING THE AURA GOAL - In this exercise you will learn to \"see\" the aura. This is for some the most difficult exercise but with persistence you can open your eyes to a new world. 1. First you must become aware of your center of v isual awareness. This step may be difficult to grasp but don't worry. A firm grasp of this step will help speed your progress but it is not necessary to see the aura. Pick an object at some distance from you. A picture on a wall is a good start. Now look a t the object. Notice the shades and textures of the object. Imagine all of this information streaming its way from the object to you. The point at which this information flow enters your body is your eyes. Imagine this information entering your eyes, an d spend some time feeling this flow. This is your physical center of visual awareness. Now close your eyes and image the object in your minds eye. As you close your eyes you will notice a shift in the location of the spot at which the information flow ente rs you. Most people notice the shift upward to a point centered on the forehead about an inch above eye level. If your shift is to somewhere else that's fine. Open your eyes and close them several times. Each time notice the shift. This new location is you r center of spiritual visual awareness. 2. Next you should find a plant . The living aura is generally easier to see. Place the plant at least five feet from you in front of a dark, uniform background. Find a quiet place to do this, free from distractio n. Spend sometime with the plant before you begin. Stroking and touching the plant will add to its aura and make for easier viewing. 3. Look at the plant. Enjoy its beauty. Take time to notice the colours and textures of the plant. As you take in the be auty of the plant, let your eyes go slightly out of focus. Look slightly off to the side of the plant and shift your visual center up. You may see a faint green light that looks like and afterimage. The aura may also appear like heat distortion around the edges of the plant. The aura will probably follow the general shape of the plant and be about 1 to 3 inches deep. 4. If you fail to see just keep trying. With an open mind and determination anyone can do it. If you have seen the aura then apply the tech nique to other objects and people. One exercise I particularly like is to look up into the sky on a clear day. Soon using the upper visual center you will see tiny squiggles darting around the sky. They usually have a small dot in their centers and will ju mp with every blink of your eyes. This is known as Orgone or Chi. It is what I"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"refer to as the UEF. Congratulations and welcome a new world of dynamic energy and interaction. SEVEN CHAKRAS Aconsists of a spiritual body, and this spiritual body is composed of vibrations of part from the physical body a human being light which are structured in a way so that they create different centres. These centres are each structured in a beautiful pattern, and they are located as follows: á THE ROOT OR BA SE CHAKRA The root chakra, or the centre at the end of the spine by the loins, is the centre which radiates a white, divine light, when seen from the highest spiritual level. This centre is the centre for the material life, it is the centre that roots t he subtle divine consciousness in the material life. Consequently it is the basis for human existence in this physical world, and if it is blocked, you will have a human being that feels rootless in both his spiritual and his physical existence. Every h uman being has a joint physical and spiritual existence. The karmic development causes an oscillation between the spiritual and the physical dimensions, and when this process goes of positively, then you feel equally at home in both places, and feel that y ou are able to do what you have to do in both places. The root chakra makes you able to manifest your existence wherever you are, and its delicate white light emits vibrations that has to do with mother's love. In mother's love the physical and the spiritu al existence is united in a sublime way. In this form of love, where you e.g. can imagine a woman nursing her baby, the demands of the physical world are united with the highest form of spiritual love. That is why this event is so important for human be ings, and therefore it is important that the period of nursing is not shortened, for in this period both the mother and the child will have stimulated, developed, and cleansed their root chakras, and this gives the newborn child the possibility for a basic development, which is far beyond any other educational means. When the mother nurses her child, the lights from their root chakras are united, and their energies are mixed together; thereby the bond, which the child needs to have to the Earth, to the m aterial life, is strengthened, making the seperation from the spiritual realms, from which it recently has left, easier. If the period of nursing is shortened unnessarily, or if it is completely omitted, then what can happen is, that the child cannot ac cept that it had to part from the spiritual realms, and it may become restless. Many children today suffer from what is called hyperactivity, and this is due to a restlessness, which originates from this. When the energies or vibrations from two people' s chakras are mixed, the following takes place: the lightwaves from the one chakra affects the lightwaves from the other chakra, and depending of the purity of the chakras, these lightwaves are mixed in a way, so they create different figures. If you look at"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"two people, e.g. a mother and a child, who have the lights from their root chakras mixed, you may see delicate figures which looks like white flowers or white crystals. If the contact is positive - if e.g. the mother is nursing her child with love, or a t least with a positive will to feed the child - then beautiful figures may appear, and the figures created by the lightwaves from the chakras become more beautiful, the more love there is between the parties. This was some more general information abou t the mixing of vibrations from two chakras. But now to the other main chakras. THE SEX OR HARA CHAKRA The sex chakra radiates a purple light, when seen from the highest level. Purple is a vivid pink, or red - violet, bright red - violet, color. When t his chakra is clean, then the person think only positive thoughts, then no impure thoughts or feelings can penetrate. With impure feelings and thoughts I mean egoistic and malicious. When we from the spiritual dimensions talk about the concepts pure or impure, this is what we mean, and nothing else. But because it is the sex chakra that stands for purity and the pure purple light, and because there has been a lot of taboos about sex, then things have been mixed up, and it has been said, that sex in itsel f is impure. It is by no means, sex is only impure, if it is practised for solely egoistic reasons, and/or by hurting others. Sadism and masochism are impure varieties of sexual behaviour, here one is hurting others to satisfy oneself, or one forces others to hurt oneself, thereby forcing a karmic burden upon someone else. When two people make love, then the lights from their sex chakras are mixed, and the purple lightwaves are creating figures, whose beauty also in this case depends on the love between the parties. Two people, who really love each other, create a fantastic aura around them when making love - it can be compared to a purple forest of fairytale trees, whose flowers and leaves create an arc above the lovers, which has so powerful vibrations, that a lot of negative karma can be burned away. In other words, just by loving another person and showing it by sexual behaviour which pleases and satisfies, one can develop very much personally and in the end thereby also spiritually. But all this im plies, that there is love between the two, and it implies that there is a will to give instead of demanding - that they both at any time are prepared to give up egoistic demands in favour of giving to the other. The purity that is reflected in ones cons ciousness when the sex chakra is clean means, that one lives a positive life, a life without complaining and reproaching to others, a life where one lives in accordance with the truth of life: that one is creating ones own consciousness - either as a posit ive or a negative impression of the world that one lives in. THE SOLAR PLEXUS CHAKRA This chakra is radiating a blue - violet light, and also a golden light. When the solar plexus is pure, then one is at peace with others, then one lives a life witho ut conflicts, where all relations are positive, and all conflicts are"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"stopped and transformed into exiting confrontations, where one is learning instead of fighting. When e.g. two people are quarreling, then the blue - violet light from the solar plexus c hakra is turning dark, and the way that the lights from the two chakras are mixed is characterized by negativity. Different figures can be seen here, e.g. it is common to see small blue - violet ogres over people who are quarreling. The darker the blue - viole t ligth is, the more hate is there between the two, and when it turns dark enough, it turns into black, and a blockage may arise in the solar plexus centre in one or both of them. I will point out the difference between a quarrel and a confrontation, for a lso within this area some rather confusing conceptions has slipped in, which have had some quite important consequences for the people here on Earth. To quarrel means to make war, which means that one attacks, feels ill - treat, complains, attack again e tc.. But a conflict may also result in a confrontation, where you do not quarrel, but where each of the parties from their own point of view explains what they feel about the actual conflict or disagreement, what they mean about the situation, but without attacking the other part. In different kinds of therapy confrontations in a cultivated form are being used, and I can mention, that here the talk is about \"I\" and \"you\" messages. I - messages are those that are used in a pure confrontation, whild you - mess ages are used in quarrelings, in verbal wars. If one restricts oneself to point out where one stands oneself, humbly and prepared to solve the conflict, then one has expressed ones love, and the whole thing can be lead into a direction where the parties co me to an agreement, because they both are willing to solve the conflict without attacking one another. Over the years things has got mixed up, actually in a completely similar way as they have within the sexual area, and any kind of confrontation has be en taboo, which has been very detrimental to one and all. If you have a conflict with another person, then you do not solve it by simply denying it. I must be worked through in a confrontation, where first of all the energies from the solar plexus centre a re activated, and first then the problem is repealed and solved. Unsolved problems in our relations to other people manifests as muscle tensions, or as blockages in many different areas, this is quite an individual matter. Within many kinds of group - therap y, e.g. within the different branches of [gestalt?] therapy, there is emphasis on finishing events between people in a correct way. THE HEART CHAKRA This chakra is the most important of them all, because it contains the seed for the ability to fee l divine, pure love for everyone and everything. Pure love is love that is devoid of egoism, of calculation, of any kind of demand. When two people who love each other purely are together, then figures quite beyond description are created above them, e. g. like a rose - pink rainbow, shining in al the most beautiful rose - pink colors, and rose - pink flowers of all shades can be seen, as rose - pink is the color of this chakra. "},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Pure love is the most important quality in a human being, anything else is subord inate. Any intellectual knowledge about this or that is completely subordinate the ability to feel love. Love is what God demands his children to learn, and it is the only real demand for spiritual development. Any technique, any kind of control, any in tellectual knowledge is subordinated the law of love. God is pure love, and the most principal duty for his children on their journey back to him/her is to learn to feel this pure love for others. Because love is also the creative aspect in life, many n egative things has happened in those societies, where there have been an emphasis on the intellectual and academical knowledge. Here much has been lost, and countless people have had their development amputated, because their creativity has been stifled in the years of growth, and thereby their ability to love. To work creatively does not only mean to paint or to write, there are lots of ways in which to work creatively. Common to them all is that one uses ones ability to create - the power that manifest s through ones hands or mouth - and that one has opportunities for development of this discharge of energy. The educational system in the socalled civilized countries on Earth has been amputated though the demands for intellectual effectivity, and there by many a heart chakra has been blocked over the years. Now when talking so much about blockages in the chakras here in the first chapter, I will hurry to add, that there is no reason to despair because of this, for life is arranged so suitable, that on e begins to clear and cleanse all the blockages one has developed, as soon as one makes the decision that one wants to be cleansed. One can then do different things in order to ease the process, like meditating, or practising yoga or other bodily technique s. One can even get rid of many blockages by swimming regularly, because water has healing powers. Therefore: if you want to get rid of the blockage in your heart chakra, then do not despair; of course it will take some time before your prayer will be g ranted, but it will happen sooner or later as you wish, especially because it is a positive wish, and because you will receive help from the spiritual dimensions to have your wish fulfilled. In a later chapter I will delve deeper into different methods for cleansing yourself. THE THROATH CHAKRA This chakra radiates a blue light, when seen from the highest level - a clear blue color, not light blue, but a clear blue color, like the sky on a clear summerday. When the throath chakra is clean, then o ne feels an inner, completely unshakable peace; one feels strong, no matter the circumstances. Not a strength that has to do with power, but a strength that springs from resting in oneself, a resting in ones higher, or divine self. When two people mix t he energies from their throath chakras, they talk together actively and intensely. If one or both is trying to dominate, then the joint"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"blue color turns dark, and figures appears which looks like small ogres or witches, and also power - symbols, like weapon of all kinds, may appear. When two people mix the energies from their throath chakras, without the desire for dominating each other, then the most beautiful blue color appears, and within this color symbols for strength and solidarity, like e.g. a beaut iful sword which protects the two against the dark forces, may appear. Also humorous figures, like laughing fairies, can be seen, for when there are no dark manifestations of power in the contact with another persons throath chakra, then there is humour. Humour is one of the most important of Gods qualities, and he/she likes to see, that his/hers children really understand this and live in accordance with it. Within most religions the higher spiritual doctrines and textbooks are devoid of humour, this is simply an error, and this is also going to be corrected now. Of course it may be a bit difficult to bring humour into the highest wisdom, but it is actually dangerous not to, for humour can to some degree protect against the kind of darkness, which tries to gain power through the contact with human beings' throath chakras. Therefore: a good joke, when the conversation becomes a bit unpleasant, that is a good idea. This is what is meant when we say that humour is disarming. THE THIRD - EYE OR BROW CHAKRA This chakra, which is also called the third eye, is located right between the eyebrows on the forehead. It is the centre for clairvoyance, visions, and transcendence of time and space in thinking. It radiates a clear, green light, and people who have b egun to develop the ability so see more than most people, have a shining ball located in the area of this chakra. This ball protects, and draws energy into the brain. When two people mix the energies from their third - eye chakras, then it may happen, that their clairvoyance increases. If they both are relatively pure in this centre, their understanding of different things will be increased considerably, and figures appear around them, which are shining green and beautiful. With very clear people there may e.g. be seen a ring showing the whole story of creation, with a deep understanding of what has happened to him and the other within the whole dimension of time, all at once. It can be seen directly here from the spiritual dimensions, what the one or the ot her understands of all this. If one or both have an unclean third - eye chakra, then the green color turns dark and muddy, and misconceptions and limitations in time and space appear, and also these can be seen from the spiritual dimensions. It is quite a lot we here from the spiritual dimensions can see, when two people meet. All this means, that especially third - eye problems are very easily mutually intensified, and that means, that if two people are married, and the one has a very unclean third - eye chak ra, then the other must be careful not to be affected by all the things that comes from there. Therefore problems with the third - eye chakra are very often the reason for divorces, because this is intuitively felt by the one with the cleanest third - eye chak ra. I am not saying this to invite people to get divorced, but I will add, that if ones chakras are relatively clean, and one is somewhat aware that one is on the way to spiritual enlightening, then one also knows how to protect oneself"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"against unwanted influence. This is very simple, as one simply asks God for protection - if necessary one can ask for a more permanent ring of protection, and if one is expecially concerned about ones third - eye chakra, then one can ask for a special protection of this are a. THE CROWN CHAKRA This chakra is the chakra that is the most penetrable for light, and its color is yellow and golden. It represents wisdom, a deep and all - embracing wisdom. When this chakra is clean, then one knows everything, understands everyt hing - nothing is obscure concerning life, Gods will, and creation. When two people mix the energies from their crowm chakras, the throath chakra is often involved because they talk together, and this means, that the light from the crown chakra and the throath chakra are often mixed. But if the crown chakras are clean, then it is relatively unimportant if they have a verbal dialogue, for then the yellow light will reach the other telepathically, i.e. a silent transference of wisdom from the one to the ot her will take place, and no words will be necessary. Many will probably know this all too well from personal experiences, where they understand another person completely, without words. But wisdom can also be transferred from the one to the other e.g. thro ugh the eyes. When a person has a very clean crown chakra, the yellow light turns into a soft, golden light, which wraps the person in an aura, that has a most beautiful and excellent influence on others. Because the crown chakra is the chakra that is t he most penetrable for light, it is very important to cleanse it, and that can be done in different ways, which I will go into details with later. When two people talk together, and their crown chakras are blocked, a very unpleasant color, a muddy, dark curry color appears, which is very easy to percept for sensitive people. A tingling and prickling sensation is felt in the crown, ones head feels uncomfortable, and therefore it is important to protect oneself, when being together with people, whose crown chakras radiates these energies. When two people whose crown chakras are unclean unite, then all kinds of misconceptions appear that has to do with limitations, limitations in time and space, the conception that one only live once, then one is wiped ou t, and whatever is connected with these concepts. It is certainly not amusing here from the spiritual dimensions to watch all the things that appear, when e.g. a group of people are gathered in a circle, and their crown chakras run amock and create all the se misconceptions and the most grotesque symbols of limitation. But now that I have just talked about humour, then I will add, that it sometimes can be quite comical to see some divine, eternal beings, sit and use a lot of time to convince each other that the only live once, that 70 years on Earth is their measured time, and then no more. It is an incredible amount of energy that sometimes is wasted this way. THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE CHAKRAS In the information given above the 7 main chakras are des cribed seperately, but when two people meet, then obviously certain energy connections will appear,"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"which has to do with their special relationship, their karmic connections, their mutual blockages, and the mutual harmony and love between them. The ener gy from the 7 chakras do however run through certain patterns, which I will try to explain in the following. Each chakra consists as I said of a bunch of light, a concentration of vibrations, and when two people meet, then these vibrations often follow thi s pattern: it starts with that the energies from the throath chakras are mixed, but often a contact is first established between the crown chakras via eye - contact. The energy then flows between them, and if there is a basis for further contact, then the light from these two chakras activate both the heart and the solar plexus chakras. From the spiritual dimensions two people look like shining rainbows, where the colors are changing and circling around in many different ways, and when they meet then the c olors from their chakras are mixed, and when the first two colors are mixed then they move further on, often to the heart chakra, where the rose - pink light then either is increased or decreased, according to the course of the events, and then the energy is activated in solar plexes, then in the sex chakra, and finally in the root chakra. Consequently, when two people meet, the energy often travels from the crown chakra and then down through the chakras, and when a full contact is established, the united ene rgy will begin to behave in a very beautiful manner. It will begin to form a unit between the two, which it does by circulating through both people's chakras in a way, so that it travels in and out of the chakras with their different colors, then the co lors are mixed to form a white light, which, if it can circulate somewhat unhindered, will begin to circulate round through all the chakras in a larger movement in a figure of eight: from one persons root chakra and up through the chakras, and then down to the others persons root chakra and up through the chakras, and so on. Both within the single individual, and within both people in their mutual contact, there are vibrations, or light from their chakras, with the color of the individual chakras, and then, when the light is mixed, turning into white or bright and appearing as a superior energy flow either around the individual or both of them. All of this may be a bit difficult to imagine, and actually it is quite a lot that happens in the individual and between the two parties in close contact with each other, when seen from the spiritual dimensions. But this description should give you an idea of what happens when people meet, and in the next chapter we will look more closely at what happens, when tw o people are having sex with each other. Chakras, Tree Of Life and Metaphysic á Dennis J. B. writes: á OM - AUM Greetings to one and all. I have recently noticed a few inquiries on Chakra's and Kundalini and as such I would like to share my perso nal findings, thoughts, experiences with this arena of metaphysics. á"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"First, a little while back I drew an analogy about the Chakra's and the Tree of Life. The point in this was to show an interesting correlation. I'd like to re - illustrate that with the following ascii - gram (diagram). á The point of the analogy was to show the dynamic presence of synchronocity (Jung concept) between the western world (mysticism) and the eastern world (mysticism). It happens on various other levels. But this is one exa mple where you can begin to see the correlations that may exist. Additionally, in the Kabbalah, the vertical lines represent pillars, if you notice there are 3 pillars in the example of the tree of life. One pillar represents Judement (left) the other repr esents Mercy (right). The middle pillar is the balance or equillibrium. There are many associations to this, the left represents intellect, the right the heart. Blending both is the key to the higher wisdoms. á If you unite all the spheres into a linear vertical line, you will find that they cross over into 8 main spheres. The pathway of the Kundalini serpent in the body's chakra system. The particular spheres represent particular aspects and energy zones of the body. The spheres are the floodgates and r egulatory systems that control the energy flux of the overall system. If the passageways are cleansed and the gateways are developed, there is a coursing of energy that takes place and ignites the power of the entire system. If such an occurence took place , the being would be catapulted into a higher energy resonance and within every given sphere zone can accomplish things beyond normal conception of ordinary human beings. The only way to activate the 8th sphere or the infinite complex, all previous 7 spher es need to be activated and cleansed. When the 7 are in full force and high resilience will the combined energy's open the 8th gateway for cleansing and development. á Once the 8th gateway is open, a tower of supernal energy surges from the entire circu it and an unleashment transpires. It is similar to the nature of sending out a power cord to a power source and igniting the switch. There is an incredible surge of energy that is of high energy, high spiritual capacitance. Those who accidentally open this gateway are in for one heck of a transcedental mind blast. Those who do it accidentally will have a few safety valves to work with, but if they wish to remain unaware and heed the warning signs, the surge is enough to destroy the fabric lining of reality that such a being would have. Additionally, if the power is very raw at that time of the opening and the being is unrefined to some extent, the person may fry some of the energy circuits within his/her body. á When this connection is activated, the pers on undergoes a type of transitional death phase where the being becomes more aware and awaken of/around his/her surrounding. Those that are able and capable of channeling the energy will perceive the universe in a totally different manner compared to how t hey originally perceived it. I might also add that their perspectivities, attitudes and methodologies in handling their life will also undergo transcendental changes. á Note: Some of this info is coming in via channeling.. just for your information. I ha ve not personally experienced many of the things I have said due to the fact that I myself am not yet of high caliber to fully ignite the Kundalini. But I have done minute discharges of the energy and interconnectings with the Kundalini Serpent. á"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Anyw ays, let me now explain my understanding of the Chakra's: á The First Chakra is the Root Chakra. It's location is between the Asphinxture muscle and the Scrotom (for men). While (for women) it is located between the Asphinxture muscle and the vaginal ca vity. It's basis is survival, Rooting, Support, Grounding. It's supportive of the interconnecting with the Earth. It's element is Earth. á The Second Chakra is the Spleen or Dan Ti'en.

It's essence is to focus and direct. It's element is Sound. á The Sixth Chakra is the Third Eye. It's location is the central cavity of the brain. The pituitary/pineal gland. It's basis is the intuition faculty and all that is governed with the imagination. It is the link from which we perceive the higher zones and higher planes. It's element is Light. It's essence is within the astral and dreaming worlds. á The Seventh Chak ra is the Crown. It's location is at the pivot axis point of the skull at the very top. It is where the three platings of the skull intersect, of the frontal lobe, the left and right hemispheres. It's basis is that of knowledge, information, understanding. It is refined thoughts. It's essence is that of blissfulness. It's element is Thought. á The Eighth Chakra is the Kundalini Serpent. It's not really a Chakra per'say. However, it's location would be just above the Crown Chakra. It would engulf the enti re body in it's energy sphere and have it's focal point like that of an ovular field. It's form mimics that of a serpent thus it's reference as the Kundalini serpent. It's foundation and basis is in Cosmic consciousness. The awareness is a part and require d within this level. The existence and development of the Kundalini serpent will mark the individual with a permanently co - existing connection awareness to IT/TAO/GOD, etc.. This, mind you, is one methodology to bring about this connection. There are many ways. á Now, why are people interested in the Chakra's aside from possibly what I have already shared about them? Well for one thing, mastery over particular chakra points enhances health and development of the being. Once a person masters a particular level of chakra, they are then ready for the next level. Upon mastery of any one chakra, certain \"gifts\" are awakened within the individual. For some of you, it may appear somewhat like yoga or meditation. In many aspects it is for it is just a method to a ccentuate the effects of the meditation. These gifts are only usable within the frame of the power and nature of the harmony instilled by this form of self - development. Those who abuse it will, as I have alluded to in previous message -- cut off the power and thus disengage their usage of the gift(s). á Additionally, there will most likely be hurdles and stumbling blocks within the framework of acquiring these gift(s) / powers. These are designed to test your worthiness of them and for your maximum capac ity usage of them. Again I point to an earlier shared quote I gave in a post. á \"With great power comes great responsibility,\" \"Those willing to harbor the responsibility, \" \"are then accentuated in the power, \" \"Those unable to harbor the responsibi lity, \" \"Will be consumed by the power. \" á As one faces the opportunities (challenges) of new - found responsibilities, one refines their usage of the gifts/powers and eventually reaches their ultimate goal.. . á Eventually these gifts and powers will within themselves become the stumbling blocks and one must transcend them. Reasons, I can explain later but for the"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"moment, suffice it to say that there is purpose in the powers and gifts but in the long run, you will not need them --- ultimately at the f inale. á Good Journey!!!

McClellan (MCCLELLW@CGS.EDU) 19 Nov 1994 writes: á Here is a list of chakras and some of the things commonly associated with each one respective ly. Is this a good version of this kind of list? Need it be corrected? (Surely one could add more things [e.g., colors, animals, rays, planets], but hold off on that for a moment, please.) CHAKRA PLACE PRINCIPLE TATTVA SENSE PETALS Sahasrara crown S at 1,000 Ajna eyebrows Cit Mahat mind 2 Visuddhi throat Ananda ether hearing 16 Anahata heart Vijnana air touch 12 Manipura navel Manas fire sight 10 Svadhisthana sex Prana water taste 6 Muladhara coccyx Anna earth smell 4 I am somewhat acquaint ed with the practical interpretation of this list. In hatha yoga, for instance, it is expected that the student might spend some time refining and stabilizing habits in the lower chakras and then sequentially work upward. The horizontal levels describe a h ierarchy of developmental stages, an itinerary of spiritual growth about which there is an inevitable and factual character. á Accordingly, these horizontal levels also have ontological and/or cosmological implications. These implications are probably wo rked out more in terms of the principles and the tattvas (and in terms of what else?) than in terms of the chakras, the senses, the animals, etc. I can only assume that in ontology as in psychology there is significance to the sequence of horizontal levels . Empathy: Definition: Empathy is the ability to feel someone else's emotions. It is the most common of all psychic abilities, and often people have it without fully realising it. Empathy sometimes occurs as a feeling that a friend is hurt or in trouble, without being physically present. Empathy is also indicated by someone feeling stressed when a friend is, without having any apparent reason to be stressed themselves. It is most common between friends and family members and when people are re laxed. With practice, empathic ability can be increased to being able to understand very detailed emotions without any additional information. "},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Connecting Empathetically: An empathic connection can be created by focusing on the person you want to co nnect with. Use a focus similar to that of projecting, but rather than travelling to the person, feel energy connecting you to them. Let the connection grow and strengthen, like webs or joined hands holding you together. Emotions flow through the connectio n in either one direction or both, depending on what you want. Open up to receive images through the link. You may feel the emotions as if they were your own, or you may feel slightly distanced from them. They may appear as emotionally charged images o r just as gut feelings. You will probably become familiar with their form very quickly after opening a link. As you receive images, watch for related details. Notice any subtler feelings associated with what you are receiving. Observe how the person re acts to their own feelings as you receive each feeling as you observe feelings, be aware of whether the feelings change to answer the questions you think about. Practice navigating between various areas of feelings by feeling your way through the related e motions. Controlled navigation can take a while to learn, but it is necessary for choosing what you receive and for eventually learning telepathy. Watching the natural empathic links between people can tell you a lot about how they interact. (This, of cour se, does take practice, though.) Disconnecting Cleanly Closing a link is just as important as opening it. When you are ready to close a link, visualise it gently drawing apart and closing off. If you try to simply remove it, it may hurt like a sudd enly - broken relationship. It could even hurt physically near the heart (which is where empathy typically connects). Be gentle with empathic links because they are representative of your relationship with the person on the other end. Both people are affecte d by it, in both good and bad ways.

Therapeutic Gemstone Properties I only use the highest quality stones. High quality stones are undyed (if possible), have no chips/fractures, an d are not irradiated (to enhance color). I recommend using rounded stones for gemstone therapy. The properties listed here are for rounded, highest quality gemstones. Non - rounded stones may have different effects. "},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Amazonite: Improve self worth. I fi nd that I have more confidence when I wear this stone. Amethyst: Spiritual Upliftment. This is also the present carrier of the purple color ray. I wear a short necklace of this when I need to communicate effectively. I place this on my stomach/liver whe n I have stomach problems. Apatite: Communication. I wear this stone when there have been misunderstanding. It is also helpful for fighting viruses. Aquamarine: Remind one of the Ocean of Love and Mercy. It can help one understand difficult situation s from a love - filled viewpoint. I either wear an Aquamarine stone or gaze into an Aquamarine crystal. I recommend. Aquamarine or Rose Quartz for those who are experiencing a lot of grief. Aventurine: Physical healing. I either place this around my neck or on the area where healing is needed. This is the stone I would choose for overall healing support. For major illnesses, I would use emerald and/or frosted quartz as well. Cape Amethyst: Inner alignment. This seems to balance the inner bodies (emotion al, spiritual, etc.) as well as provide more energy. I use a very small sphere (4 - 6mm) on acupressure points for 1 - 5 minutes to clear energy blockages. For larger spheres (8mm), use less than a minute. Also good for Arthritis - wrap strands around aching j oint. Carnelian: Balance creativity and mental processes. When my husband was wheezing from allergies, I placed this on him. He stopped wheezing within 30 seconds. When I removed it, he started wheezing again. This worked best with natural carnelian (br ight orange). However, clear man - made Carnelian worked on him as well. Wash carnelian under water after wearing it. Carnelian is the carrier of the orange ray. Citrine: Upliftment. I wear this to help align my spine. I either place a strand along my spi ne or wear it around my neck. Citrine encourages the yellow ray to support the body. Coral: Emotional Foundation. Coral protects and strengthens one's emotional foundation. Diamond: Increase personal clarity. I find this aligns me with my higher purp ose as well as offers many healing properties. I have had profound results with Diamond therapy. (Some diamond therapists are listed below under gemstone therapists.) Emerald: Physical and emotional healing. This is the strongest physical healing gemsto ne that I know. I use it by placing it on the area which needs healing or wearing it around my neck. Emerald is the carrier of the green ray. Green Fluorite: Hormone Balance. This stone has been helpful with hormonal changes such as PMS and menopause. Purple Rainbow Fluorite: Change. Helps one get out of ruts.

I have done many me ditations with malachite to gather knowledge on gemstones and on myself. Moldavite: Grounding stone. Really puts one in their body. This is extremely strong -- you may wish to try black onyx for grounding first. [Helps you talk to other sentient beings (humans and whales and dolphins). I haven't tried this.] Moonstone: Help one accept other stone's help. Balance yin/yang. Moss Agate: Get in touch with nature. Plant knowledge. Mother of Pearl: Protection; Know mother's love. This stone is a great protective stone. Black Obsidian: Grounding stone. I gaze into it for a very short time (1 - 5 minutes) each day for 3 days when I need insight into a problem. I use Black Obsidian when I have been too dense to understand what Aquamarine has been trying to show me. Black Onyx: Help one to change bad habits. This is great when used in a necklace. I have found it helps people notice their chakras when placed on each chakra. (This can be done one chakra at a time.) It is a great grounding stone. Black Ony x is always dyed. Black Opal: See self as Soul. I find this stone is great for helping one see the possibilities of how one can be all they can be. This stone seems to strengthen bones too. Opal: See possibilities; Discover a broader view. I use opal to see all the possibilities in a situation. I find it very freeing when I feel I am blocked into a situation. Some people find this stone very hard to wear. I find it wonderful. A little opal can go a long way. Pearl: Enable one to accept love. See th e good parts of oneself so you can love yourself and others more. Poppy Jasper: Gain a positive outlook. I find that I am very happy when I wear this stone.

Long after India's seers i mmortalised it in the Vedas, it suffered bad press under European missionaries who belittled it as \"fate\" and \"fatalism,\" and today finds itself again in the ascendancy as the subtle and all - encompassing principle which governs man's experiential universe in a way likened to gravity's governance over the physical plane. Like gravity, karma was always there in its fullest potency, even when people did not comprehend it. "},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The early seers who brought through the Vedas were practitioners, mystics and divine o racles who put into practice the knowledge of karma. To them, Karma -- from the root kri, \"to do\" -- was a power by which they could influence the Gods, nature, weather, harvests and enemies through right intent and rites righteously performed. Thus by the ir actions they could determine their destiny. Through the ages, other realized souls explained the workings of karma, revealing details of this cosmic law and, when the tradition of writing came into vogue, recording it for future generations. In this way they established karma as perhaps the fundamental principle of Hindu consciousness and culture then and now. Primordial and unborn, karma is anadi, \"beginningless.\" Its Rig Veda definitions are linked to the performance of the homa, the potent fire rit e that temporarily opens a window between the three worlds -- physical, subtle and causal. With Sanskrit mantras, mudras and meditative powers, Vedic priests precipitated a flow of shakti from highly evolved souls, Mahadevas, residing in inner worlds, secu ring the blessings of the Gods, insuring happiness for the clan. Neglecting the rites or misperforming them made negative karma and invited calamity and loss of wealth. Communities were tight knit, and the clan prospered or suffered collectively. When o ne person did transgress, elders suspected not so much an individual's willful intent to do malice as malperformance of the homa. The ritual was held responsible for sustaining a spiritual force - field strong enough to ward off demonic entities that torment , confuse and misguide weak individuals. Priests assumed primary responsibility for the well - being of the community. Indologist Herman W. Hull, author of The Vedic Origins of Karma, writes: \"In the context of Vedic ritual thought, good and bad apparently refer to a valuation of action based on ritual exactitude: good being equated with the correct performance of the rite, bad with the incorrect performance.\" Swami Vivekananda, who spoke and wrote on karma extensively, commented on this understanding of th e law: \"The Vedic doctrine of karma is the same as in Judaism and all other religions, that is to say, the purification of the mind through sacrifices and such other external means.\" The Upanishads (circa 1500 - 600 bce), the philosophic treatises of the Vedas, show how karma relates to the individual and his or her actions -- with questions of morality, responsibility, reward and retribution. They clearly command the individual to be responsibly concerned about personal conduct and not expect the priestho od alone to secure and safeguard one's karma through the performance of sacred rites. As Sage Yajnavalkya says in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad: \"What becomes of this man? Indeed, one becomes good by good action and bad by bad action.\" Karma in Mystica l Vision The yogis of the ancient Sankhya philosophical system offered a deeply mystical vision. They scrutinized karma to profound levels of magnification and stressed its bearing on the soul of man. What they saw was a plasmic jelly pulsating within t he subtle bodies of each person. Embedded in this plasma, which persists from life to life, are the seeds of all past thought and action. In each lifetime, certain of these karmic seeds are released into the nerve system with coded impulsions and tendencie s affecting present actions. The effects were most commonly understood to determine three spheres of life: a) jati, family and"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"occupation; b) ayus, health and length of life; c) bhoga, quality and enjoyment of life. Karma as a Cosmic Building Block To the rishi seers, karma appeared with such fundamental force and substantive reality that they perceived it as one of the thirty - six primary evolutes of form, called tattvas, which range from Parashakti, pure consciousness, to prithivi tattva, earth. Ka rma is number eight, called niyati tattva, a spiritual - magnetic energy form. This identification of its magnetic quality is a crucial clue to understanding how karma \"comes back,\" rather than just \"goes out.\" Each karma, or action, generates a vibration, a distinct oscillation of force, a vasana, or subliminal inclination that continues to vibrate in the mind. These vasanas are magnetic conglomerates of subconscious impressions. Like attracts like. Acts of love attract loving acts, malice attracts malice. A nd each action, karma, continues to attract until demagnetized. This is accomplished through re - experiencing it, or resolving it with understanding -- rather than compounding it with reaction -- or through other subtler spiritual means and practices. Karma Goes Global \"What goes around comes around,\" sings country Western singer Willie Nelson. His ballad about \"getting back what you give out\" dominated US and European radio waves for years and became the West's homespun Upanishad on the Hindu concep t of karma. You can hardly watch TV today without a subtle lesson in this cosmic law of cause and effect. Everywhere, karma has squeezed through the white picket fences of non - Hindu religions and irrevocably attached itself to the global ethic emerging wor ldwide. But karma has suffered a chronic association with the word fate. Fate is a Western idea, derived largely from the three Abrahamic religions, Judaism, Christianity and Islam. It means, with wide variation, that one's life has been set by agencies outside oneself. Karma is exactly the opposite. \"`It is the coward and the fool who says this is fate,' goes the Sanskrit proverb,\" said Swami Vivekananda. \"But it is the strong man who stands up and says, `I will make my fate.'\" KARMA GLOSSARY ka rmabhanda: The bonds of actions, i.e., being bound to rebirth. karmadosha: Sinful work or vice, blunder; evil consequences. karmadushta: Corrupt in action. karmaja: Act - born; resulting or produced from an act, good or bad. karmajiva: Livelihood earned by work, trade, profession. karmakshaya: Annihilation of work. karmakshetra: Place of religious acts. karmanirhara: The removal of bad deeds or their effects. karmanishtha: Diligent in performing religious actions. karmapaka: Ripening of acts, matured results of acts of former births. karmaphala: The fruit of actions. karmarambha: The commencement of an act."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"karmashaya: \"Holder of karma.\" Describes body of the soul. karmasamya: Equipoise of karma. karmasiddhi: Successful action. karmatyaga: Aband oning worldly duties and obligations. karmavasha: The necessary influence or repercussion of actions. karmavidhi: Rule of action; mode of conducting ceremonies. karmayoga: \"Union through action;\" selfless religious service. kriyamana karma: Actions bei ng made.

Most of this process happens on an unconscious level, but there is a way for you to become more a ware of this process as it unfolds in your life. Earth's ancient civilizations studied the movements of the celestial bodies to understand themselves. They viewed the universe as a kind of celestial clock which chronicles man's evolution. This divinatio n Science has come to be known as astrology. In astrology, time is not seen as linear, but cyclical. It can be measured by following the movements of the sun, moon and planets. The moon rules our emotions, and during its 29 ╜ day journey around the ear th, you experience a complete cycle within your emotional body. This cycle influences how you create in the world, and it can be broken down into 8 phases, lasting roughly three and a half days each. Here is how the moon influences your life. New Moon This is the beginning of the lunar cycle, and during this time we feel pulled to concentrate on a new direction, focus and theme. Pay special attention to your issues and desires at this time, for what you focus on now sets the theme for this cycle. C rescent Moon The moon at crescent pulls you to clarify your theme established at new moon. As you determine your next steps, you will build the necessary momentum to reach your goals. Your desires will be fueled by the will to act. First Quarter Moon"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"First quarter moon urges you to act upon your new moon desires.

Take note of the people you meet at gibbous moon and the assistance they may be able to offer you. Be open, as well, to new ideas which offer solutions to the challenges presented by your new moon theme. Full Moon This is the time for major realizations concerning your lunar theme.

In the classical literature of hatha yo ga kundalini is described as a coiled serpent at the base of the spine. The image of coiling, like a spring, conveys the sense of untapped potential energy. Perhaps more meaningfully kundalini can be described as a great reservoir of creative energy at the base of the spine. It's not useful to sit with our consciousness fixed in our head and think of kundalini as a foreign force running up and down our spine. Unfortunately the serpent image may serve to accentuate this alien nature of the image. It's more u seful to think of kundalini energy as the very foundation of our consciousness so that when kundalini moves through our bodies our consciousness necessarily changes with it. The concept of kundalini can also be examined from a strictly psychological per spective. From this perspective kundalini can be thought of as a rich source of psychic or libidinous energy in our unconscious. In the classical literature of Kashmir Shaivism kundalini is described in three different manifestions. The first of these i s as the universal energy or para - kundalini. The second of these is as the energizing function of the body - mind complex or prana - kundalini. The third of these is as consciousness or shakti - kundalini which simultaneously subsumes and intermediates between t hese two. Ultimately these three forms are the same but understanding these three different forms will help to understand the differerent manifestations of kundalini. What is the difference between prana and kundalini? What is the difference betwee n qi (or chi) and kundalini? First let us try to relate to concepts from the same tradition - prana and kundalini. Prana has been translated as the ``vital breath'' and ``bio - energetic motility''; it is associated with maintaining the functioning of th e mind and body. Kundalini, in its form as prana - kundalini, is identical to prana ; however, Kundalini also has a manifestations as consciousness and a as a unifying cosmic energy. One could ascribe these same aspects to prana as well so past a certain poi nt these become distinctions without differences. From the subjective standpoint of an individual actually experiencing the awakening of kundalini I have found three completely different opinions: The first opinion is that a pranic awakening is only a prelude to a full kundalini awakening. Tibetan yogins that I have encountered consider the activation of prana (Tibetan: rlung) as merely a prerequisite for the activation of kundalini (Tibetan: gTummo). What's attractive about this viewpoint is that it ex plains the difference between the experience of simply having pleasant sensations in the spine and the much more powerful experience of having a ``freight - train'' - like full kundalini experience. The second opinion, espoused by Swami Shivom Tirth for exampl e, is that prana and kundalini are absolutely equivalent and that it is not meaningful in any way to describe a difference between kundalini rising and prana rising. When posed with question as to how to distinguish"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"between pleasant sensations that show so me pranic - activity in the spine and the much more powerful experience Swami Shivom Tirth said that the difference is not in the nature of the activity but in the consciousness that observes it. If the consciousness that experiences the pranic activity is s eated within the spine (or more correctly, the central channel, known as the sushumna), then the experience is felt much more powerfully. The third opinion, espoused by the modern hatha yogin, Desikaran, is that pranic awakening is the true experience to b e aimed for and kundalini is actually an obstruction. Desikaran sees the kundalini as a block in the central channel and thus the kundalini must be ``killed'' to make way for the prana. This is the most unusual view of the three. The Chinese concept of qi (or chi) can be safely identified with the Indian concept of prana. If all this seems confusing - don't worry, you're in good company. My conclusion is that these are all different terminologies for dealing with a common set of experiences. Any one of these viewpoints is adequate for describing the full range of experiences. What is probably more relevant is to distinguish two different experiences which are often confused. In one an individual experiences some pleasant energizing electric energy ru nning along the spine. This experience itself brings about a wide range of experiences and results in vitality and sensitivity. Another very distinct experience is the experience of kundalini entering the sushumna and rising up the spine. As soon as kundal ini enters the sushumna this experience will completely overwhelm ordinary waking consciousness. From the moment that kundalini enters the sushumna there will no longer be a distrinction between the subjective consciousness which experiences and the object of experience. This experience much more profoundly transfigures consciousness. If kundalini is universal, why do some kundalini yogins seem to have more kundalini - energy than others ?? It's an intriguing question. If an individual's kundalini is viewed as simply a personal reservoir of a cosmic energy then why would one person appear to have more of a reservoir of kundalini energy than another? Nevertheless, this does appear to be the case. This is probably another advantage of the viewpoint t hat prana (or qi) is the same as kundalini. Some Chinese texts distinguish between ``innate qi'' or ``pre - natal qi'' that one is born with and ``cultivated qi'' that can be developed. Clearly some people simply have more ``innate qi.'' This manifests as a stronger more resilient body and greater general vitality. Through training those that have relatively weak ``innate qi'' may surpass those who have strong ``innate qi'' but do not train. There are many stories in the Chinese literature of Qi Gong abou t people who took up Qi Gong in order to improve their poor health became powerful martial artists or great qi gong masters. Of course those that have strong ``innate qi'' and also train their qi may develop the strongest qi of all. What does kunda lini have to do with spiritual enlightenment? What is the goal of kundalini yoga?"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" First we need a few concepts: In yogic anatomy the sushumna is the central channel and conduit for the kundalini energy that runs along our spine and up to the crown of o ur head. Along this channel are placed additional channel networks called cakras. These cakras are associated with major aspects of our anatomy - for example our throat, heart, solar plexus, and in turn these aspects of our anatomy are related to aspects o f our human nature. According to the literature of kundalini yoga our experience of these centers is limited due to knots which restrict the flow of energy into these centers. Three knots are particuarly important. The knot of Brahma which restricts the ce nter at the base of the spine. The knot of Vishnu which restricts the heart center and the knot of Rudra which restricts the center between the eyebrows. These knots form an important framework in yogic thinking and the stages toward enlightenment are arti culated in terms of breaking through these knots in the yogic classic the Hatha Yoga Pradipika as well as in some of the yoga upanishads. Specifically, four stages of progress are described: arambha, ghata, parichaya and nishpatti. Arambha is associate d with breaking the knot of Brahma and the awakening of kundalini. Ghata is associated with breaking the knot of Vishnu and and with internal absorption. Parichaya the absorption deepens and in nishpatti the knot of Rudra is pierced and the kundalini may a scend to the center at the crown of the head. In this state transcendence is integrated and, according to the yogic liteature, the yogi has nothing more to attain. Putting these elaborate physiological decriptions aside, the goal of kundalini yoga is t he same as the goal of any legimitate spiritual practice: To be liberated from the limited bounds of the self - centered and alienated ego. In kundalini yoga this is associated with internal manifestations of the kundalini but the external manifestations sho uld be similar to any other legitiimate spiritual practice. So does everyone agree that kundalini awakening is necessary for enlightenment? The view that kundalini awakening is necessary for enlightenment is held in the diverse literature of Ka shmir Shaivism and in other Hindu Tantric literature. It is found in the literature of the Hatha Yogis and the Nath Sampradaya. You will find similar views in many Buddhist Tantric works. In addition this view is held by recent spiritual figures such as Sh ri Ramakrishna, Swami Sivananda, Paramahamsa Yogananda and Swami Vivekananda and of course by contemporary kundalini yogins themselves. Nevertheless there are some dissenters from this view. These include Sri Chinmoy, Da Free John and Gurdjieff. Dissen t can take a number of different forms. For Gurjieff kundalini is associated only with a binding force that leads us to be more attached to the world. Such a view of kundalini is not entirely inaccurate but only reflects the functioning of kundalini in the lower energy centers. For Sri Chinmoy kundalini is an amplifying function that may make an individual more powerful but not more enlightened. From my perspective this also only addresses the impact of kundalini while it operates in the lower energy center s. Da Free John (born Franklin Jones, a. k. a. Da Love Ananda) has a much more fundamental criticism of kundalini. As far as I understand his position, for him"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"enlightenment cannot be the result of an experience; it is a cognitive transformation. Kunda lini may evoke a wide variety of experiences but these are not in and of themselves enlightening. This is an interesting perspective but it seems to assume that the raising of kundalini is an experience in which an ego - consciousness experiences a separate object known as kundalini. Again, this view is consistent with the experience of kundalini in the lower energy centers in which the ego is detached from the movement of kundalini and kundalini experiences are precieved as separate from oneself. However, I would argue that as kundalini rises the ego - consciousness becomes infused in a more fundamental consciousness of cit - shakti - kundalini and this experience does in fact produce a fundamental cognitive change. Finally, there are many other spiritual pract ices, such as Zen, Vipassana meditation that consider kundalini irrelevant. Some practitioners or even teachers of these paths, such as Jiyu Kennet, may have kundalini experiences but generally kundalini is not a pivotal part of these paths. Can I use kundalini yoga simply to improve my health? Yoga exercises which were traditionally used to purify the body in preparation for awakening the kundalini can also be used simply to improve the health. To practice techniques aimed at actively awakening kundalini with the goal of simply improving your health seems to be a misuse of these powerful techniques. There are those that teach kundalini yoga principally emphasizing its benefits on health without much discussion of the spiritual benefits. This is how hatha yoga has been taught in the west for some time. The affect of this approach depends on the attitude of the student. There is certainly nothing wrong with trying to improve your health but there is a tension between awakening an energy that wi ll ultimately burn up the ego and trying to shape that energy to simply fulfill an ego - oriented motive. Is there any scientific basis for kundalini and the cakras? Do I really have to believe that all these cakras physically exist? Research on kundalini is especially spotty. There is no compelling work to show that the system represents insights into actual human anatomy. But it's important to understand that kundalini and its network of channels and cakras is simply how yogins have chosen to ex plain their experience and that yogins from many cultures have arrived at similar, though not identical, concepts. The true physical mechanisms underlying these experiences may be very different from those described. Izaak Benthov has proposed a model to e xplain kundalini in terms of micro - motion in the brain. In this model experiences are associated with parts of the body, such as the heart, because the part of the brain associated with that part of the body is stimulated by micro - vibrations. His model is treated in ``The Kundalini Experience'' by Sannella referenced below. From a practical perspective the key thing is our subjective experience and that the roadmap of these subjective experiences has been mapped out. "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Is Chinese qi gong a kind of ku ndalini yoga? If there is any contemporary teaching that is even more diverse in approach than kundalini yoga it must be qi gong. As a result it is hard to compare kundalini yoga to qi gong. From my limited exposure to qi gong it is clear there are man y qi gong practices that are identical to kundalini yoga practices. What is also clear is that may qi gong practitioners have reported experiences that are identical to those of kundalini yogins. In so far as each of these practices aims at eliminating blo cks to the qi/prana energy then they share a common ground. What about Tibetan Buddhism - has kundalini been known in Tibet? Kundalini yoga in the Natha Sampradaya and Vajrayana in Tibetan Buddhism both take their origin from the Mahasiddhas wh o were active in India from the 8th century to the 12th century. Kundalini yoga practices formed the core of the teachings of a number of these Mahasiddhas and are strongly represented in both Tibetan Buddhist practices and contemporary kundalini yoga prac tices. Kundalini yoga was spoken of as ``Candali yoga'' by these Mahasiddhas and became known as gTummo rnal 'byor in Tibet. Candali yoga was a key practice of the famous Tibetan yogin Milarepa. The role of kundalini yoga in Tibetan Buddhism is discussed i n more detail in the Kundalini Yogas FAQ. Are there any other traditions that show awareness of kundalini? If you believe that kundalini is at the basis of spiritual progress then every valid spiritual tradition must have some awareness of kund alini. Christianity (especially Quakerism and Pentecostalism), Sufism, Qabalistic mysticism, alchemy and magick all have literature which demonstrates some awareness of the kundalini process but these traditions are not, to this author's awareness, so open in their exposition of the techniques and so it is hard to judge the depth of understanding latent in these traditions. Nevertheless, the imagery is so unmistakable in these traditions that each must have, at least at one time, been conversant with the mo vement of kundalini. So how do I awaken kundalini? Indirectly kundalini can be awakened by devotion, by selfless service, or by intellectual enquiry. In these paths the blocks to the awakening of kundalini are slowly removed. Occasionally, indi viduals on these paths will experience a sudden awakening of kundalini but generally because the blocks are slowly and gently removed kundalini - like experiences evolve slowly in these paths. Broadly speaking there are two radically different direct app roaches to awakening kundalini. One approach requires initiation by a guru and relies upon a technique called shaktipat, or ``descent of shakti.'' It is variously called: Siddha Mahayoga, Kundalini Mahayoga or Sahaja Yoga (Spontaneous Yoga). These approach es are treated in the Siddha Mahayoga FAQ. The other approach uses intentional yogic techniques . The styles using intentional techniques include"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Mantra Yoga, Hatha Yoga, Laya Yoga or Kriya Yoga. These approaches are treated in the Kundalini Yogas FAQ . Fundamentally the approach of Siddha Mahayoga and the Kundalini Yogas are different. In Siddha Mahayoga the guru awakens the kundalini and after that the core of the practice is the inactive and non - willful surrender to kundalini. In Kundalini Yogas the will is used to awaken the kundalini and to guide its progress. Clearly these are different approaches. Nevertheless, elements of the each approach occur in the practices of the other. Siddha Mahayogins may use asanas, pranayamas and other hatha yoga pract ices. On the other hand gurus in Kundalini Yoga may give infusions of shakti to their students to help them at particular points in their practice. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using effort, in kundalini yogas, as opposed to the gra ce of the guru, in siddha mahayoga, to awaken kundalini? Since every practitioner brings his own unique inclinations and obstacles to the practice of yoga it is very hard to generalize on this point. In terms of actually awakening kundalini gurus of Si ddha Mahayoga claim that the kundalini is more easily and reliably awakened by the grace of the guru than by individual effort. In my limited experience I would agree. with this assertion. While not every long - term student of either practice necessarily sh ows signs of kundalini awakening it is amazing how many people have had instant awakenings of kundalini through initiation from siddha gurus. In terms of encountering difficulties along the path the siddha gurus would also claim that fewer problems due to kundalini awakening, such as mental imbalance, are encountered by students of Siddha Mahayoga. Here I think the results are mixed. It seems to me that the guidance of the teacher in either Siddha Mahayoga or Kundalini Yoga is more a determining factor than which style of kundalini practice is employed. Generally speaking each style of practice has its strengths and weakness. The strength of Siddha Mahayoga is the ease with which it awakens the kundalini. The weakness is that because the kundalini is so easily awakened by the guru students of Siddha Mahayoga often have completely undisciplined personal meditation practices. Time is spent instead to trying to recreate some of their initial experiences by following the guru around hoping for his or her grace Some people spend 20 or more years in this manner without ever developing an inner core of practice or experience. The strength of the family of Kundalini Yogas is that the progress is at least apparently more under the control of the student of the yoga. These students seem more likely to have disciplined personal practices and more of an understanding of how the practice relates to their own experience. Unfortunately for some students this leads to a fairly egotistical approach to their practice and ultimately the kundalini energy is used to bolster the ego rather than to merge the ego in bliss. What are the signs of an awakened kundalini? "},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Briefly, according to classical literature the signs of an awakened kundalini can be grouped int o: mental signs, vocal signs and physical signs. Mental signs can include visions that range from ecstatically blissful to terrifyingly frightful. Vocal signs can include spontaneous vocal expressions that range from singing or reciting mantras to make var ious animals sounds such as growling or chirping. Physical signs include trembling, shaking and spontaneously performing hatha yoga postures and pranayamas. From a more subjective perspective the more pleasant experiences associated with a kundalini aw akening may include: waves of bliss, periods of elation, glimpses of transcendental consciousness. The less pleasant experiences associated with a kundalini awakening may include: trembling, sharp aches in areas associated with the cakras, periods of irrat ional anxiety, sudden flashes of heat. Are these methods of awakening kundalini dangerous? What about Gopi Krishna's books? If we take the psychological perspective and view kundalini as the power latent in our unconscious then it is easy to un derstand that awakening this force is going to bring a greater amount of unconscious material into our consciousness. Even in the best of circumstances this is likely to be uncomfortable and if an individual is barely coping with his unconscious even under normal circumstances then awakening kundalini may push the individual over into psychosis. This phenomenon has been documented many times. Forceful methods of awakening kundalini pose additional dangers. Because quite forceful methods can be used to a waken kundalini these techniques themselves are potentially physically and mentally disruptive. An individual named Gopi Krishna awakened his kundalini by doing unguided meditation on his crown cakra. His life after awakening was both blessed by ecstatic b liss and tormented by physical and mental discomfort. Eventually his experience stabilized. He wrote down his experiences in a recently re - released autbiography entitled ``Living with Kundalini.'' Gopi Krishna's autobiography appears to be an honest repres entation of his experiences but it is only one extreme datapoint in the panorama of experience on kundalini yoga. It represents dangers in forceful unguided practice but it is not representative of a typical practicioner's experience. But even if k undalini is dangerous, isn't it a faster way to enlighenment? First of all it may be useful to observe that there is no technique currently known on earth that appears to be rapidly catapulting large number of individuals toward enlightenment. Because kundalini yogas deal so directly with a powerful enlightening force it seems natural that they would be ``faster'', but there appears to be alot of tortoise and hare phenomena at work with newbie kundalini yogins. Many people begin kundalini yogas, have st rong initial experiences and then become frightened. Many who perservere through this initial phase become distracted by the energy and focus on temporal and phenomenal applications of the energy.

There have been scandals regarding the teachers of many paths, both spiritual and non - spiritual ; however, it is probably fair to say that kundalini yogins have had more than their share. Since the first publication of these frequently - asked - questions in 1994 more than one well - known kundalini yoga teacher has been implicated in having clandestine affairs with students and has been asked to s tep down from his position as spiritual leader as a result. An advanced kundalini yogin is typically a powerful charismatic individual who has the ability to directly influence the minds of others. Westerners often mistake this power as a sign of enlig htenment and allow such teachers liberties as a result. In addition it is quite common for kundalini yoga to temporarily accentuate the sex drive. This period requires extra discipline. Finally, kundalini yoga is closely associated with tantrism and se x is often used in conjunction with tantric practice. Where sex is used there is of course the opportunity for misuse or abuse. If my kundalini is awakened will I need to change my lifestyle? It's hard to have your cake and eat it too. If you a waken kundalini in order to change and enrich your life it's reasonable to expect you may need to change your lifestyle as a result. The recommendations of both classical literature and experience is that sleep and diet will need to be moderated otherwise severe discomfort may arise. Furthermore without moderating sexual activity and physical work it will be hard to experience much success with kundalini. The extent that these elements of your life need to change depends on the nature of the individual. Whi le genuine mental imbalances arising from kundalini are rare nearly every kundalini yogin will find periods when one needs to be especially sensitive to needs for sleep, quiet and diet. Where can I learn more? Here are some references for furthe r reading. They may not be the easiest books to find but they are currently in print and are very good in their categories. Note that by definition no reputable book on kundalini will tell you how to awaken your kundalini. Either by effort or by shaktipat initiation, practicing kundalini yoga requires the instruction of an experienced teacher. Some introductory practices for cleansing the channels can be learned from books. Good introductory survey: White, John (Editor) (1990). Kundalini - Evolution and Enlightenment.

The basic idea generally associated with why people meditate is that during our day we are constantly subjected to sensory input and our minds are always active in the process of thinking. We read the newspaper, study books, write reports, engage in conversation, solve problems, etc etc. Typically, as we do these normal activities we engage in a constant mental commentary, sort of an inner \"The Drama of Me.\" Usually people aren't fully aware of all the mental thought activity that we are con stantly engaged in. Meditation allows all this activity to settle down, and often results in the mind becoming more peaceful, calm and focused. In essence, meditation allows the awareness to become 'rejuvenated'. Meditation can be considered a tech nique, or practice. It usually involves concentrating on an object, such as a flower, a candle, a sound or word, or the breath. Over time, the number of random thoughts occuring diminishes. More importantly, your attachment to these thoughts, and your iden tification with them, progressively become less. The meditator may get caught up in a thought pattern, but once he/she becomes aware of this, attention is gently brought back to the object of concentration. Meditation can also be objectless, for example co nsisting of just sitting. Experiences during meditation probably vary significantly from one individual to another, or at least if different techniques are involved. Relaxation, increased awareness, mental focus and clarity, and a sense of peace are th e most common by - products of meditation. While much has been written about the benefits of"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"meditation, the best attitude is not to have any expectations when practicing. Having a sense of expectation of (positive) results is likely to create unnecessary st rain in the practice. As well, since meditation involves becoming more aware and more sensitive to what is within you, facing unpleasant parts of oneself may well be part of meditation. Regardless of the experience, the meditator should try to be aware of the experience and of any attachment to it. Failure to experience silence, peace of mind, mental clarity, bliss, or other promoted benefit of meditation is not in itself a sign of incorrect practice or that one can't concentrate properly or concent rate enough to be good at meditation. Whether one experiences peace or bliss is not what is important. What is generally considered important in meditation is that one is regular with their meditation - every day - and that one make a reasonable effort, but not strain, to remain with the object of concentration during the practice. With regular practice one inevitably acquires an increased understanding of and proficiency with the particular meditation technique. Some people use the formal concentrative m editation as a preliminary step to practicing a mindfulness meditation during the day where one tries to maintain a calm but increased awareness of one's thoughts and actions during the day. For some people, meditation is primarily a spiritual practice , and in some cases the meditation practice may be closely tied to the practice of a religion such as, for example, Hinduism or Buddhism. 2.1 How is meditation different from relaxation, thinking, concentration or self - hypnosis? Relaxation: Relaxat ion is a common by - product of meditation. Relaxation itself can assume many forms, such as taking a hot bath or reclining in the Lazy - boy and watching tv, etc. Meditation is an active process where the meditator remains fully aware of what the awareness is doing. It also attempts to transcend the thought process whereas many forms of relaxation still engage the thought process. Meditation allows the body to relax and can offset the effects of stress both mentally and physically to a potentially much greater degree than passive relaxation. Thinking: Thoughts generally consume energy in the process of their formation. Constant thought - activity, especially of random nature, can tire the mind and even bring on headache. Meditation attempts to transcend this crude level of thought activity. Through regular practice one becomes aware that they are not their thoughts but that there is an awareness that exists independent of thought. Descartes (\"I think, therefore I am\") obviously was not a regular meditator! Concentration: Meditation begins with concentration, but after an initial period of concentration, thought activity decreases and keeping the awareness focused becomes more spontaneous. At this point the person may or may not continue to employ the object of concentration. Self - hypnosis: Self - hypnosis, like meditation, involves at least an initial period of concentration on an object. However in hypnosis one does not try to"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"maintain an awareness of the here - and - now, or to stay conscious of the process. Instead one essentially enters a sort of semi - conscious trance. 2.2 What are the different meditation techniques? Meditation involves concentrating on something to take our attention beyond the random thought activity that is usually going on in o ur heads. This can involve a solid object or picture, a mantra, breath, or guided visualization. Typical objects employed include a candle flame or a flower. Some people use pictures, such as a mandala - a highly colored symmetric painting - or a pictu re of a spiritual teacher in a high meditative state. Mantras are sounds which have a flowing, meditative quality and may be repeated out loud or inwardly. The breath is also a common focal point. Finally, guided visualization is also considered by some to be a form of meditation. A guided visualization can help to bring one into a meditative state; also, visualization may be used once a meditative state has been reached to produce various results. 2.3 Which is right for me? There is no \"right\" medi tation technique for everybody. Some techniques work better for certain people while other techniques work better for other people. The important thing is to find what works for you. 2.4 What are the abc's of meditation? There are a few recommended guidelines for meditation: + It should be done every day, preferably at the same time + It should preferably be done before a meal rather than after a meal + A spot should be set aside for meditation, which should be a quiet place and used for nothing but meditation + One should sit with the spine straight and vertical (a chair is ok to use) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 3.0 Is there any religious implication or affiliation with meditation? Meditat ion has been and still is a central practice in eastern religions, for contacting \"God\" or one's higher Self. Christianity also has semblances of meditation, such as the biblical statement \"The kingdom of heaven is within you\". Churches have a meditative a tmosphere. Meditation deals with contacting something within us that is peaceful, calm, rejuvenating, and meaningful. Whether one calls this something \"God\" or \"soul\" or \"the inner child\" or \"theta - wave activity\" or \"peace\" or \"silence\" is not importan t.

In many traditions meditation practice is a means for reinforcing ethical qualities. In these traditions, calmness of mind, peacefulness and happiness are possible in meditation and in life generally only if they are accompanied by the observance of ethical norms of behavio ur. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 4.0 What is the best time of day to meditate? While meditation is beneficial at any time, most people who meditate agree that early morning is the best time to meditat e. Part of the reason is that it is said that in early morning the hustle - and - bustle of the world has not yet begun and so it is easier to establish a meditative atmosphere. Having an early morning meditation also lets us carry some of the energy and peace of the meditation into our daily activities. Many people also meditate either before dinner or later in the evening. Others also meditate at noon. A short meditation at these times allows one to throw off some of the accumulated stress of the work - day and become rejuvenated for further activity. An important consideration is when your schedule will allow you to meditate. Having a time of the day set aside for meditation helps in maintaining regularity. 4.1 Why do some people use music while meditat ing? Meditative music (not rock - n - roll !) can help in establishing a meditative atmosphere. Also, some people find meditation relatively easy but find that the hard thing is to actually get themselves to sit down and start their meditation. Music can h elp make this easier. Some people use music quite often while others prefer silent meditation and never use it. 4.2 Should I meditate with my eyes open or with my eyes closed? Different traditions give different answers. Closing your eyes may contr ibute to drowsiness and sleepiness -- if that's the case for you then try opening them a little. Opening your eyes may be distracting. If that's the case try closing your eyes or direct your gaze on a blank wall (Zen - style). Or try with the eyes open halfway or a bit more, the gaze unfocussed and directed downward, but keeping the head erect with the chin slightly tucked in. Sometimes meditators experience headaches from focussing on a spot too close to the eyes (perhaps closer than three feet). Whether focus sed or unfocussed, the gaze should be relaxed in order to prevent eyestrain or headache. Experiment and see what works for you and then stick with your choice of technique. If you are using a candle, flower, or other visual object in your meditation th en here the technique itself requires your eyes to be at least partly open."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" 4.3 What are the physiological effects of meditation? The most common physiological effects of meditation are reduced blood pressure, lower pulse rate, decreased metabolic rate and changes in the concentration of serum levels of various substances. 4.4 When I meditate I experience physical pain in my body. What should I do? Sensations (itching/aches/pains/etc.) can arise in the body when meditating for several reason s. Sometimes the cause is just an uncomfortable posture -- make sure that your posture is comfortable under normal circumstances. Other times the cause is that sensations in the body are more noticable in meditation. The body and mind are calmer and you are able to notice more details in your bodily experience. It is often interesting to simply observe these sensations in your body : to use them as the objects of meditation. Sometimes these sensations just go away without your having to move or change your po sture. Remember that a quiet body contributes to a quiet mind. 4.5 How long should I meditate? When first learning meditation it is usually not possible to meditate for more than 10 - 15 minutes. After regular practice for awhile, one becomes able to meditate for longer periods of time. Many people meditate twice - daily for 20 - 30 minutes each time, but the right duration and frequency is for each individual to decide. 4.6 Do I need a teacher? It is theoretically possible to learn meditation fro m a book. However most people who teach and practice meditation agree that a teacher can be an invaluable aid in learning a meditation technique and making sure it is practiced correctly. The beginner will usually have several questions which a teacher wil l be able to answer. Also, learning with a group of people, eg a meditation class, allows you to experience the benefit of meditating with a group of people. Most people find that they have some of their best meditations while meditating in a group, becaus e there is a collective energy and focus present. Various individuals and groups teach meditation. Some charge and some do not. Many different techniques are taught, some more spiritual in nature and others mainly concerned with stress - reduction and ga ining a little peace of mind. As always, the important thing is finding what works for you. SHIELDING Shutdown Shutdown means stopping all psychic activity, totally but temporarily. Shutdown can be useful if shielding is impractical or di fficult to do. Shutting down all psychic perceptions can give you a chance to figure out what you have"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"experienced, recover from emotional surprise/shock, and help you return to normal reality. Shutdown is accomplished by focusing all conscious thought toward the physical world. You can do several things to accomplish this. Become involved with other people, preferably with a lot of social interaction and discussion. Do physical activity; walk around, stretch, jog, or do anything else that makes you mor e aware of your physical body. Let the thoughts of the psychic experiences float away like a dream, without concern about them. If there is anything you especially enjoy doing, like games, programming, writing, art, etc., involve yourself deeply in that. D o anything you can think of to keep both your mind and body occupied in the physical world, and don't let memories of psychic experiences distract you from it. When you are ready to restart (and move out of shutdown), simply start opening your percepti ons again as you would when you first practice any psychic ability. You can do this at any time, whenever you are comfortable and ready to do it. Definition of a Shield A shield is a bubble of energy that works just like a fence or a traditional p hysical shield. It can be used to screen the energy that moves through it, to keep out unwanted energy, to keep in energy (usually not that helpful), and to defend against someone else's negative energy. Shields are very helpful for people who are strongly empathic but have difficulty keeping everyone else's emotions separate from their own. Creating a Shield Shields can take many forms and can be created in many ways. The method explained here will be based on visualization. Other methods exist th at are closer to ritual magick which work just as well. The general method is to form energy around yourself that is programmed to allow only certain energy to move through. Begin by clearly thinking through your purpose for the shield. Why do you want a shield? What exactly do you want it to do? Will it allow no energy in, or just allow good energy in?\u0000\u0000ëc ¼ └ &T\u0000 \u0000 ê\"*a\u0000 ┘ êI \u0000 K=z │ pÆ5 ╜ oR\u0000 \u0000 2!ÆôYK SvâDC A ╪ ô{\u0000\"e │ ùô%Mâ;ÆD ╞╦ b Γ 2 μ L ╚ ü │ \u0000dj"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"ÜX ┘ ;û ╠ \u0000ä@Q¡`éObvw\u0000 ╝ ¥o\u0000âÄA$ ─▓ ! ╦ ` Θ ¿\u0000ZZ!\u0000¢\u0000 ▌ ë$ ╠ π"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"╟ Ñ \\ ;Åv ≥ \u0000 ⁿ ╟ {ù; ≤ ╝ y ½ 5[« ▀ ê^ \u0000 k^ª \u0000 ╣ 5ôI$¿¡ √ ° \u0000 D\u0000Æò¬»Æ \u0000 ╞ \u0000Ñ Z ≤ I ² ;?ôá\u0000 ⌠╙ ä ╢╖ BPïr ▀ ε▒ ¥ ╣ \u0000é\u0000âO\u0000K ≈ l ╡┼ E4QAM+\u0000Ñl \u0000JI\"\u00006 ≥ ╔ \u0000 m ├ .é%(\"I\u0000é\u0000X ┴ o|·ïà Σ ∞ éjâ2Ká ╘ i:M\u0000ü \u0000 &H2j"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"îÜåÑ μ ¬"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"åè«óEfü¿ÜÉ I ▄ Ç ┴ \u0000\u0000 ╥ \u0000L\u0000dF ├ S)ì ╒ ÿ\u0000H\u0000 \u0000BàÉ ╩ àC\u0000@\u0000$ ╦ \u0000 `1\"{é\u0000¬ ┬ \u0000Tá\u0000 ╚ û ┴ b *\u0000 ├ LI - \u0000ÇMAÉa Ω A\u0000÷Üªdh0\u0000éd1$ Ω b å¬ ÿh █ \u0000\u0000Çb\u0000 \u0000 ic \u0000 å ╡░ gG] ╘ dÖ0 ▄ 3 ╣ \u0000O ┴ ,"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"⌐ 1 \u0000 \u0000 ├ !Páê\u0000 ▒ yb █ $ └┌ \u0000 \u0000\u0000éK7$ êWMÆI3"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"â ⌐ \u0000Y ░╚ ná\u0000ëà\u0000\u0000B ╣ 1 ╜ \u0000ú ï;Ç \u0000 Bas6{ ╨ \u0000 φ▓ \u00007WÇ7 ┘╙ \u0000L"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Çn ∞ \u0000 └ ±·\u0000ï7t ε k\u0000uª ⁿ ±ß ²₧ \u0000 ╧⌐ R«Ñ Ω P¡Kæ[ ∙ U ╥▄ n ▄ R8 ╥ \u0000_ ▌ Eè ┌▀ \u0000 ?ñ ╨ ² m<I[ÑibRö - ╙┼ μ Θ E\u0000T\u0000\u0000ä ┐ Ñn ▀ öe(JRR ⁿ >+L¿R ⁿ Pè\u0000öÑ\u0000\u0000\u0000&ö\u0000 \u0000 !)+\u0000& ╒ X ╩ a\u0000\u0000Ç(<T¡\u0000\u0000\u0000\u00006iñññ ╡ R(4\u0000Ö ½ Iè ┤╥ ÜIÑ&\u0000E \u0000 \u0000 x\u0000 ≈ ∩ ╥ ÿ\u0000&¬i%$P ∙ \u0000I ╦ you feel the shield is strong enough, let go. It will continue to maintain itself with whatever purpose you gave it as you created it. If it gets depleted over time, repeat the creation as needed to add more energy to it. Shield Styles Effects of a Shield A shield can have any of multiple effects, alone or in combination. A shield can keep energy on one side or the other, or act as a filter to allow only certain energy inside. It can convert energy from one form to another so that a filter is unnecessary. Shields can help empaths keep out some of the extra emotional energy so they don't feel overwhelmed. Shields can also define boundaries in the physical world, which people will tend not to cross (often without realizing why they stopped there). The edg e of a shield can be used like a psychic alarm; when someone physically crosses it, the person sustaining the shield gets a psychic warning that someone is nearby. Shields have whatever effects you intend them to have when you create them. Just like an y psychic ability, energy follows thought. Whatever you are thinking about and planning when you create the shield will affect how it is created, so that it best matches your thoughts. Shield effects are not at all limited to what is listed here; anything you can think of, you can do. Maintaining a Shield Stressful conditions can sometimes interfere with maintaining a shield. Under normal circumstances, a shield will maintain itself for quite a while before becoming depleted. However, large amounts of negative energy, attacks, illness, and lack of sleep can all cause a weak shield. This section details how to maintain a shield more successfully under stressful conditions. Daily Stress The most common difficulty with shielding is daily stres s. While a shield often helps prevent psychic energy from adding to the stress, eventually the shield can weaken. The best cure is more rest, planned time alone, meditating, and avoiding environmental factors that are stressful. Daily (or weekly) meditatio n replenishes a drained shield and also helps relieve the internal stress that weakens the shield. Empathic Overload Empathic overload is similar to, but can be more intense than, normal stress. As many empaths have realized, large crowds, schools , and cities are often filled with intense emotional energy. Empaths who are particularly sensitive to this learn to build very strong shields to keep other people's emotions separate from"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"their own. The first few days of an emotionally intense environment can be particularly tiring if the empath has not yet made a strong enough shield. To protect from the empathic pounding of emotionally charged environments, meditation and careful examination of the self are very important. Meditation helps relieve th e stress and emotional energy in a controlled way. It also gives time to identify the difference between empathic emotions and personal emotions. By identifying the self carefully (especially emotionally), an extra layer is added to the shield which define s \"own emotions\" and \"external emotions\" and separates the two. This helps external emotions bounce off harmlessly. Electromagnetic Fields Occasionally, electromagnetic fields can tear at a shield, causing it to weaken. This happens most commonly in people who work with high power electronic equipment or who live near large power lines. If the person has grown up in those conditions, the shield will probably already be adjusted to take that into account. For people who have just entered that en vironment, though, it can be a rather intense pounding. In this case, careful examination of the electromagnetic field energies and personal shield energies can help the shield adjust. Experiment with drawing energy from the field and changing it into a mo re useful form of energy. With some conscious practice, getting the shield to adjust to that energy takes only a little effort. Psychic Battle Shields also become weakened by psychic battles. Though this is an area that most people will never need to deal with, there are some who can't avoid it (and may have known they were dealing with it before ever picking up a book on psychic abilities). Shielding is a natural defense that can become weakened when attacked too strongly. During psychic battl e, shields are held in place strongly by willpower and energy. Willpower has the most control over the shield. Total confidence in the soul self (not arrogance, which is self - defeating, but calm confidence to stay in place and endure) is the best way to ke ep a shield from being drained. If you are uncomfortable trusting in your own endurance, trust in the universe to do what is best for you, whether or not that is protection. If the shield does start being drained, drawing additional energy from a comfo rtable source will help replenish it. Basically, keep drawing and don't let up until you know you are no longer in danger. If you feel you cannot hold up the strength any longer, consider placing your psychic self some place safe (or even shutting down) to avoid actually being attacked. A safe place is any place, real or imagined, that you feel secure. Attack rarely causes any physical manifestation stronger than a headache, but headaches can be severe. Avoidance is best. "},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" ASTRAL PROJECTION Def inition Astral projection means projecting your consciousness (or a part thereof) to the astral plane to view and interact with it. The astral plane is a world made of energy that can be shaped by thought and emotion. In the astral plane, a person can c reate objects and communicate with other beings, both humans and spirits. The level of danger is about the same as normal physical life - you might run into someone who will get angry with you for no apparent reason, but as long as you don't go looking for trouble, such occurances are unlikely. Astral Projection vs. Out of Body Experiences Astral projection and out of body experiences are often assumed to be the same thing; however, they are not. The astral plane is a place. Leaving the body is a fo rm of travel. One of the places a person can go when out of body is the astral plane; however, that is not the only place. Also, being out of body is not the only way to get to the astral plane. This book will focus on interacting with the astral plane while fully awake and not out of body. It will not cover out of body experiences. The astral plane is shaped by thought. As such, thought can be used to view it and interact with it. The visualization method of astral projection presented here uses thou ght as the primary means of interacting with the astral plane. The states of consciousness of daydreaming and of being creative are what is needed for this type of projection. Creativity can trigger psychic perceptions. Creativity comes from the soul, w hich is connected on some level to other souls. Visualization makes use of this connection to perceive the astral plane objectively. Visualization Method Decide on a place you would like to visit astrally; you may create a place if you think it d oes not already exist. If you want to visit a friend's astral home, hold the image of your friend (emotionally or visually) in your mind also. Relax and let your mind go into a daydream state. Gently focus on the place you would like to visit, and allow yourself to picture that place in your mind. If other thoughts interfere, note them and then let them go and return to the picture. As you relax, focus on the picture until it becomes very clear. You will use this picture as an anchor point to return t o in later projections. It serves as an easy focus point. Make the picture clear so that you are aware of seeing, feeling, and hearing the picture, including as many senses as possible. Once you have an easy time maintaining your focus on the picture, c hange it somewhat. Add a tree, or move things around; whatever you picture will change it"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"in that way. Pick up an object and resize it, change its color, change its density; then return it to normal. Learn to reshape that area of the astral plane. Practice until you are very comfortable doing this. Learn to change your shape, walk, fly, swim, and examine the details of objects. The next important step in astral projection is traveling to places other people have created without letting preconceptions cha nge your views of them. In some areas the things people have created may actively maintain themselves so others can not change them, but in the more malleable areas be aware that your thoughts can affect things. Stay open to any information that enters your mind, no matter how odd or unrelated it may seem to be. Some astral places are relatively normal; others are extremely odd and may change frequently. As you examine each image, use it to bring to mind other images also, just like a normal stream of as sociation. Over time you will more images more quickly, and your ability to view a larger area will increase. Uses of Astral Projection Astral projection is useful for practicing perceptive and creative psychic abilities, especially telepathy. It als o works as an energy source and a way to assist healing on a soul level. It lets you explore mental concepts that don't fit into the regular world, such as four or five dimensional space (or more). Some people are able to hear music beyond anything norm ally heard. Some call it angels singing; others call it music of the spheres. Exploring other people's astral creations and creating your own can also be quite fun. Whatever you can imagine, you can play with on the astral plane. Soul joining is also po ssible on the astral plane. Because astrally you can change shape, one possibility is to become fog - like. If several people do this, it is possible to overlap the soul energy, and eventually the souls. This can be a very intimate experience emotionally an d nearly always creates a strong telepathic connection. Remaining in the astral plane when doing this is difficult if you aren't already very comfortable with projecting. For two (or more) people who are very comfortable projecting and comfortable with eac h other, it can be a very joyous experience. Common Problems Q: I can't keep a clear picture of the astral plane in my mind. It's blurry and not very detailed. A: You may need to work with some ability other than sight. Try listening and feeli ng your way around, rather than needing to give it a definite visual shape. Also, make sure you aren't being distracted by the physical world around you. Q: I can get to the astral plane and see it okay, but I can't move around. I feel like I'm glued do wn. A: Sometimes it takes practice to be able to move naturally.

Let the shell just sit there stuck t he first few times, and eventually, you will find that movement comes naturally. This can be especially helpful if you can fly but have difficulty walking astrally. Q: I can't see anything anyone else creates, only my own things. A: This could happen for two reasons. One possibility is that your own expectations are interfering. If so, practice the suggestions given at the beginning of this book for avoiding expectations. The other possibility is that you are not accustomed to viewing other people's e nergy. Practice with psiballs with friends, and with aura vision, to help improve your ability to see other people's energy. Other energies may feel a bit different, but they are all variations of the energy you can already see. Q: When I'm trying to ac tually leave my body, rather than just see the astral plane while awake, I get almost out, but then my heart beat speeds up and I wake back up again. A: The heart rate shows anxiety; consider whether you are nervous about what you are doing. The anxiety could come from a variety of things. If you are afraid of the astral plane, research it more and deal with your fears before trying to project again. If you aren't afraid of projecting, but still have a lot of anxiety, consider some possibilities. How wil l your beliefs change if you succeed? Are you worried about anything that would happen to you, emotionally or mentally, after you succeeded? How will you handle the new experience? What does it mean to you to succeed? Are you ready for the new experiences? If you are not ready, what would make you ready? Q: I want to explore the astral plane but I'm afraid it might be dangerous or unhealthy. Something keeps pushing me back in. A: Your own fears are pushing you back in. Emotions can take form when you are in the astral plane, and you may perceive them as actual blocks to your progress. The only way to defeat fears is to face them, either by experiencing what you are afraid of, or by researching it to the point that you know there is nothing to be afraid of. The astral plane is less dangerous than the physical world because you can always relocate somewhere else if a situation isn't to your liking. At the worst, you can simply leave the astral plane and return to the physical world (with a shutdown if you wish). Your fears will probably not decrease over time unless you continue to learn about astral projection. Keep reading about it, talk with others about their experiences, and practice things yourself slowly. Do it a little at a time so that you are totally comfortable before going on ahead. There really isn't anything to be afraid of except the shadows of your own fears (much like the cave in one of the Star Wars movies). Face the fears, and they will show themselves to be only illusions. If yo u want to feel more prepared for whatever occurs, read the section on maintaining shielding. Some of the ways of dealing with psychic battle (which is uncommon, but occassionally happens) are discussed in that section. "},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":" A Treatise on Astral Projectio n, Part 2: Training by Robert Bruce To trigger the projection of the Astral body, while fully conscious, there are four major requirements: Relaxing your body 100% while staying awake. Concentrating 100% on what you are doing. Having enough energy available. Pressuring the astral body to separate. Together, these four things will trigger an OOBE. Below are exercises that will teach how to relax the body, concentrate, clear the mind, raise energy, stimulate the chakras and enter the Trance Stat e. CALMING THE MIND Relaxation You must learn and master a full body relaxation exercise. If you know one already it can be adapted to suit. Here is a very simple one: Sit or lie down, and relax. Starting with the feet, tense and relax them. Continue this with calves, thighs, hips, stomach, chest, arms, neck and face until your whole body is deeply relaxed. Go over this a few times, making sure your muscles stay relaxed. Note: Deep physical relaxation is the key to bringing on the trance state, i.e. , deep relaxation CAUSES the trance state. Once you are in the Trance State, projection on the astral body is relatively easy. Contemplation When you begin meditation, you will be plagued with thoughts from your surface mind, which acts like a huge Mem o pad. It carries messages, reminders, pressing thoughts, problems to solve unresolved issues etc. It is constantly busy, it NEVER rests, thoughts, thoughts, thoughts, one after the other, all clamoring for attention. Before you attempt to clear your min d, with the breath awareness exercise below, it is wise to deal with these surface thoughts by the act of contemplating them. Sit comfortably, do the relaxation exercise and think, nothing more, just think. Search out the strongest thoughts in your mind an d examine them, try to resolve and understand them. Note the word: THINKING. Contemplation does not involve clearing the mind, or visualization. It requires you to THINK, deeply and thoroughly, about something, to gain a deeper understanding of its nature and how it relates to you, an insight. Breath Awareness Meditation This is a simple form of meditation. It will clear your mind and focus your awareness. Sit or lie down, close your eyes, do the relaxation exercise and clear your mind. Breathe deeply and slowly and focus on the breath entering and leaving your body. Feel it coming in and feel it going out. Focus your whole attention on your lungs and the breathing process. This simple action is enough to occupy your surface mind. Firmly push intruding thoughts away, as they begin, before they can gather strength and distract you. Breath awareness occupies the surface mind and allows you to think on a much deeper level. Surface Thoughts Sounds are very distracting, they generate surface thoughts. A car horn will generate: \"Who's that, what's happening?\" A door opening will generate: \"Who's coming in or going out?\" The surface mind is always very curious about what is happening around you. It wants to know all, and it wants to inform you of every lit tle thing going on around you. It will pressure you to open your eyes, get up and go find out what's happening."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Don't allow this to happen. USE these annoying, attention getting thoughts as a training aide. By learning to quash and ignore them, your powe rs of concentration will grow. Stop these annoying little thoughts as they begin, before they can take root and grow into something stronger. For example: \"Who's that, what's happening?\" becomes: \"Who's th............\" \"Who's coming in, or going out?\" becomes: \"Who's co............\" With practice the start of these distracting thoughts will get shorter and shorter until you get: \"Wh....?........?..........\" and \" W...?................... \" And finally: \".......?........?...........................?... ................\" Many people say they can't clear their mind as they are too easily distracted by all the small noises that surround them, in normal day to day activity. DON'T use music or other sounds to blanket these out, USE them for training. It's l ike weight lifting, if you train with feather dusters your strength will not increase. You need to master this, the hard way, if you want to give your mind real muscle. Slowly but surely you will master the ability to clear your mind. Once accomplished, you will have gained a valuable mental tool. You will be able to concentrate 100% of your attention, on one task, to the TOTAL exclusion of everything else. I sometimes meditate, in the Trance State, successfully, in a noisy, crowded room with little child ren crawling all over me. NOTHING breaks my concentration. CONCENTRATION You must be able to concentrate and focus completely on what you are doing. Lack of concentration is the single, biggest cause of projection failure. It affects every aspect of pr ojection, from the relaxation exercise, to the Trance State and actual projection. To test your ability to concentrate: Sit and relax. Close your eyes and clear your mind of ALL thought. Breathe slowly and deeply and count each breath, at the end of each exhale. Hold it totally BLANK, apart from the counting, for as long as you can. See how long you can hold it like this. Be honest with yourself, every time a thought intrudes start counting from the beginning again. You are doing well if can do this for longer than ten breaths. Ten breaths is, however, not long enough. Don't worry though, this can be improved on with the exercises below. Concentration Exercise (1) After image retention: Relax, calm your mind, and look at a candle or a light bulb. Plac e this light in front of you, a couple of feet away, and stare fixedly at it for a minute or two. Close your eyes and concentrate on the after image this will generate behind your closed eyelids. Try and keep sight of it for as long as possible. Use breath awareness to keep the mind clear, while you are doing this. Try and make the after image grow, instead of fading away. Concentration Exercise (2) One point stare: Pick a spot on a wall and gaze at it. Don't focus on it, just gaze at it gently. Clear yo ur mind of ALL thoughts and forcibly hold it blank. Concentrate HARD, on breath awareness while you are doing this. When you feel a thought beginning, push it away, don't let it finish! Hold this for as long as you can. Do this several times a day or more if you can. Concentration Exercise (3) Energy breathing: Sit and relax. Close your eyes and clear your mind. Do the breath awareness exercise and imagine the air you are breathing IN is brightly colored energy of your favorite color. Imagine the air you are breathing OUT is a murky gray, full of toxic waste. This is a purification exercise. It stimulates your chakras into absorbing energy on the inhale and getting rid of negative energy on the exhale."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Note: Try your best not to tense up while you are d oing these concentration exercises, it is ALL mental. In the beginning, it may feel as if you have to tense your mind into a tight ball to stop it thinking, but in time you will find the opposite to be true. When you get used to it, clearing the mind is VE RY relaxing. The Trance State When you have attained a deep level of relaxation and mental calmness, you will feel your body begin to get very, very heavy. This heaviness is the main symptom of your brain waves changing from the Beta to the Alpha level as you enter a trance. The Trance State is caused by deep physical and mental relaxation. There is nothing weird or supernatural about it. It simply means your body has entered the Sleep State while your conscious mind is fully awake. How to Enter A Tran ce Do the relaxation exercise and calm your mind through breath awareness. Imagine you are climbing down a ladder in the dark. Don't visualize a ladder; just imagine you can feel yourself doing it. On the exhale, feel yourself climbing a step or two down the ladder with your imaginary Hands (outlined below). On the inhale, feel yourself holding still on the ladder. What is needed is a mental falling effect inside your mind. This changes the level of brain wave activity from the awake level (Beta) to the a sleep level (Alpha) or the deep sleep level (Theta). Once your level of brain wave activity reaches Alpha you will enter a trance. Keep doing this for as long as it takes. The time it takes to enter trance will vary, depending on your experience with deep relaxation and mental calmness. Note: Once you get the heavy feeling, stop the mental falling exercise. If you don't like the ladder, imagine you are in a lift, feel yourself falling on the exhale and holding on the inhale. Or, Imagine you are a feather, feel yourself floating down on the exhale and holding still on the inhale. As I stated above, you need a mental falling effect to lower your level of brain wave activity. This mental falling effect, when combined with deep relaxation and mental calmness, will cause you to enter the Trance State. Feel free to use any scenario you are familiar with to bring about this going deeper feeling. A trance feels like: Everything gets quieter and you feel like you are in a much bigger place. There is a very slight humming feeling in your body. Everything feels different. It feels a bit like putting a cardboard box over your head in the dark, you can feel the atmosphere change. It's like everything goes fuzzy or slightly blurred. Any sharp noises, while in trance, fe el like a physical blow to the Solar Plexus. Deep Trance The level of trance you achieve depends greatly on your relaxation, concentration skills and will power. To enter a deeper trance, i.e., Theta level and beyond, you has to concentrate much more a nd for much longer, on the mental falling sensation aided by breath awareness. The first level of trance, i.e., when you get very heavy, is quite deep enough for projection. I strongly advise against forcing yourself deeper than a light trance, until you h ave plenty of experience with the Trance State. How can you tell if you are entering a deep trance? There are four very noticeable symptoms: An uncomfortable feeling of cold that doesn't make you shiver, coupled with a steady loss of body heat. Menta lly, you will feel very odd and everything will feel extremely slooooow. Your thought processes will slow down as if you had been given a strong pain killing injection. You will feel disassociated from your body, i.e.; a strong floating sensation and eve rything will seem far away."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Total physical Paralysis. Note: These four things, ALL TOGETHER, signify you are entering a deep trance. Do not mistake the mild floating sensation you sometimes get with light trance, i.e., as you astral body comes loose. O r the slight loss of body heat from sitting still for a long time and the mild paralysis, i.e., the heaviness, for a deep trance. The sensation of deep trance is quite uncomfortable and unmistakable for what it is. It is very difficult to get into the de ep Trance State, as you need highly developed relaxation, concentration and trance state skills plus lots and lots of will power and mental energy. You will not accidentally fall into it. If you are worried you are going too deep, remember this: You CAN pull yourself out of it at any time. Concentrate ALL your will on moving your fingers or toes. Once you can move a finger or toe, flex your hands, move your arms, shake your head, i.e., reanimate your body; and get up and walk around for a few minutes. Fal ling into a deep trance should not be a problem with these exercises. I have seen many people in meditation groups etc, enter a light trance and not be able to pull themselves out of it, i.e.; they float away with the Faeries. Usually some kind person wi ll talk them out of it or massage their wrists etc to get them to come back to reality. This is unnecessary and is the result of lop - sided training, i.e., no concentration or will power training. The person only THINKS they cannot come back and therefore d oes not try very hard. It is also a good way of getting attention from the group. Note: Your mind is extremely powerful and has vast untapped resources. It can do ANYTHING, no limits, if it is trained, conditioned and properly motivated. Energy Body Ex pansion At some point after entering the Trance State, you will feel a mild paralysis come over you. This will soon be accompanied by a deepening vibration and a buzzing feeling all over. You may also feel like you are huge and swollen. The paralysis, vi brations and the huge feeling are symptoms of the energy body expanding and the astral body loosening. This is part of the normal sleep process. The energy body expands and opens in order to accumulate and store energy. During this, the astral body drifts free, slightly out phase with the physical body. Trance Familiarity Many people blow their projection simply because they are not used to the trance state. They think it is a briefly opened window into the Astral dimension. This is simply NOT true. If you stay mentally and physically calm when you enter the Trance State, you can maintain it for hours. I regularly spend several hours at a time in the Trance State. If, when you enter trance, you think: \"Yes! I've done it! I'm in a trance! Gotta hurry and get out quick...before it stops!\" You'll blow it for sure! The trance will be ended by the simple act of getting over excited, i.e., breaking relaxation and mental calmness. It's a good idea to spend time in the Trance State, just getting used to it, bef ore you try and project. Just relax, stay calm, focus on breath awareness, and hold the trance. It won't end until you want it to. Get used to how it feels. When you are comfortable doing this, do the energy raising and chakra stimulation exercises, below, in trance. Note: You do not HAVE to be in a trance to learn energy and chakra work, it just works better in trance Trance practice can be done lying down, but is best done in a comfortable armchair. Your astral body will be loose in the Trance Sta te, so try lifting your astral arms and legs out, one at a time. Use your HANDS to do this, as shown in the next section. Focus and FEEL your awareness in an arm and slowly lift it free of"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"your body. You may feel a slight tickling or localized dizziness in side your arm or leg, as you do this. Lift your astral arm up and look at it, with your eyes closed, but DOESN'T move a muscle. In this state you should be able to see it through your closed eyelids, but don't worry if you can't, this will come later. Li fting your astral arms free is good practice for projection. Later, you will use these astral arms to pull your astral body free of the physical. Tactile Imaging Tactile imaging is a perception or FEELING of localized bodily awareness. Your hands are ve ry closely linked to your bodily awareness. They are intimately aware of every part of your body. Imaginary HANDS, outlined below, is only extension of this (hand to body) awareness. When you are asked to feel your awareness, in any part of your body, PRET END your hands, your real hands, are going to touch that area of your body. Then use the awareness this generates in that area to imagine your imaginary HANDS are there. Keep your eyes closed and hold your hands out a foot or so in front of your face. Co ncentrate, FEEL where they are and try and SEE them through the blackness behind your closed eyes. Cross your wrists, slowly move them about, turn your hands over, open and close your fingers. Look hard, concentrate, as if you were trying to see in the dar k, and you will see a faint moving shadow in your mind eye, where your hands and arms are. Close your eyes and touch the tip of your nose with the index finger of your right hand. You'll find you can accurately put that finger on any part of your body wi th your eyes closed. Try it; put your hand, your real hand, on different parts of your body like this. You know exactly where your hands are at all times, you can sense and feel where they are. If you observe what is happening in your mind, while you are d oing this, you will notice you become aware of the part of your body you are going to touch the instant you make the decision to touch it. Go over your whole body like this, getting used to the sensation of awareness it generates in different areas of yo ur body. What is happening is this: Part of your mind is shifting into, and HIGHLIGHTING, the area you are going to touch, in order to guide your hand to the exact spot. Your mind shifts part of its awareness to this spot and acts like a homing beacon fo r your hand. The ability to shift your awareness into different parts of your body like this is VITAL to energy work and this projection method. Note: You do not have to actually visualize these HANDS, i.e., and see or imagine you can see them. It is ALL tactile, NOT visual. You just have to be able to pretend to FEEL them doing something, like you are rehearsing some simple action in your mind. I originally developed this technique for blind people. Blind people cannot visualize AT ALL, if they have been blind since birth, but they do have a very keen sense of bodily awareness. The majority of sighted people also have great trouble with visualization of any kind, and all projection techniques depend heavily on visualization. This being the case, I develop ed a projection technique that does NOT depend on visualization to exert pressure on the astral body to separate. It turned out to be so much easier, and more successful, than the other visualization based techniques, that I discarded them in favor of this simple tactile method. Note: Blind people are not blind in astral form. The astral body does not have any organs as such; it is a point of consciousness only. The astral body you are aware of while projecting is provided courtesy of the subconscious min ds creative ability "},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"ASTRAL METHOD EXERCISES Sit, or lie down, do the relaxation exercise and clear you mind with breath awareness. Focus your awareness in your feet. Use your HANDS to pull energy up from your feet, through your legs, to the ba se chakra. Imagine you are gripping energy and pulling it up through you. Just like you did when you used these HANDS with breath awareness and colour breathing, pulling air and energy into your lungs. Note: Try and imagine your HANDS are inside your legs and just inside the front of your torso as you do this. Use breath awareness as an aide to energy raising. Draw energy up through you, with the inhale, and hold it in place on the exhale. Do this over and over again, pulling energy to the Base chakra, for at least a few minutes. You may or may not feel anything while you do this. Even if you don't, you are still drawing some energy with this exercise. The amount of energy drawn up through you will increase as the chakras develop with time and use. F rom the feet, up the legs to the base centre, is a natural path for the energy that flows through you. This energy will stimulate your chakras and they will transform this, basic energy, into energy of a different type. This transformed energy will then fl ow into your subtle bodies, energizing them. With practise, you will actually FEEL this energy tingling and surging through you. HERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT METHODS Find a very comfortable position, that you can completely relax in, but not too comfortable...because you may fall asleap. I find that lieing down in bed, facing up with my eyes closed is the best way. Relax as completely as you can. Your body is the first thing to relax, then your mind. Start off by tightening every muscle in yo ur body. First tighten your feet, then your lower legs, then upper legs, then butt (stop giggling...yes your butt), then your stomach, then your chest, then your hands, then your forearms, then your upper arms, then your neck, then your face (try out diffe rent things with your face till you feel it relax...like frowning then unfrowning). If you are not relaxed yet, do it again from the start. In the begining this may take some time. Some muscles may not wish to relax and you may get itches that make you mov e a muscle and get unrelaxed again. With time and practice, this will become easier. Now you must relax your mind. This is possibly one of the more difficult steps, but it will become easier...i promise. You will see that as you relax, thoughts will st art to pop into your head. Important matters will begin to come to the surface. If you are not projecting, and only wish to relax, this is an easy way to discover what priorities your worries have in your head, as well as a way to think clearly about thing s to straighten them out. If one thought is becomeing increasingly annoying and won't go away, i would advise to deal with that thought before carrying on. A good way that i have found to clear your mind and relax is to concentrait on your breathing. Breat h in through you nose and out through your mouth. Breath deeply and listen to your breathe. As you inhale, picture a light blue misty cloud entering your ands and contracts at the same time...as if everything in the world gets bigger, but my head gets bigg er. I"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"can't see anything, but it feels like i can zip around and sense everything around me. Almost like seeing faint visions. A SIMPLE METHOD *Relax in a bed or reclining chair. *Take deep breaths, allowing your breath to slow naturall y. Do not force it to slow down. *Induce sensations of \"dropping\" rapidly through the bed, several \"inches\" aice it, and it is best not to think about it, but your breathing will get slower and slower till it becomes regular and steady, just like when you are asleap. At this stage you should be on the border of wakefullness and sleep. You will notice that your thinking seems clearer, maybe faster...but very single tracked. During the day, you may notice that even when you concentrait alot, other tho ughts creep in, but here, they usually wont. Images may pop up before your eyes like miniature dreams. You can play with them sometimes, or even create ones that you wish, though that road leads to Lucid Dreaming. The important thing to do at this point, i s not to do anything. Be as passive as you can. Your main thought at this point should be \"Whatever happens...happens, let it be\". Sit back and wait, and slowly, you may start to feel something like vibrations, or electricity passing through your body. Als o, your conciousness may start to feel different. To me, it feels as if my conciousness expands and contracts at the same time...as if everything in the world gets bigger, but my head gets bigger.

These are m ild and you must remain passive. "},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"*Visualize yourself floating above your body and feeling the \"drops\". As soon as you have left your body, you will know, mostly at first by the following sensation followed by a temporary \"blindness\" and lightweight fee ling. Remember: This will take practice, so give it time! Remember, once you are out, move far away from your body or you may be pulled back in. When you want to return, simply visualize your body and being back in it. HERES ANOTHER METHOD!!!!! I believe that an OBE occurs when the body is asleep and the mind is awake. It takes practice in order to achieve this state. A good way to get there is if you wake up during the night. When you first feel yourself starting to wake u p, you need to stay perfectly still (to keep your body as asleep as possible). Now, in order to remember to keep the body still, you need to have OOBE on the brain. That is, I found that if I thought about OBE's a lot during the day, when I began to wake up at night, the first thought in my mind was \"Ok, give it a try\". To continue, once you start waking up, stay perfectly still. The next step is to let your body fall back asleep while your mind stays awake. Easier said than done. I have fou nd that even a brief lapse in concentration sends my mind back to sleep with the body. Here is a tip on how to keep the mind awake. I am sure you have seen that when you close your eyes, there is darkness but also movement as light passes across your eyelids, etc. What I do is look at the darkness and the movement and pretend I am watching a movie. This does two things. One: It occupies the mind so you can stay awake, and Two: It allows for a distraction of physical sensation or body awareness. (Like when you watch a movie or TV and suddenly realize you have been in an uncomfortable position. You didn't notice earlier because you were absorbed in what you were watching). The distraction described in number 2 above allows the body to go to s leep. Chances are, if you can maintain this for even a short time, you will experience hypnogogic imagery. Hynogogic imagery occurs during the hypnogogic state between awake and asleep. It involves vivid imagery. It is different from \"thinking about\" something. You actually see images as if you were looking at them with your eyes. And, it can be pretty neat. Once you start seeing hynogogic images, you will know that you are on your way. Just go with it. Try to be as passive as possible. Any excitement will release adrenaline and your body will wake up. Game over. Just relax and watch the images unfold like you are watching a TV show that you don't really care about. What"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"happens next can vary. It is not uncommon to hear creaking noise. Vibrations or a swaying sensation may start. Let me tell you, if you hear creaking and feel swaying, get ready, because you are about to OBE. The important points are: 1) Think about OBE's a lot during the day. This will help you remember when you start to wake up. Keeping a dream/obe journal helps. 2) Stay still. 3) Watch the movie behind your eyes 4) Most important: concentrate. If you lose concentration, you will fall asleep. Your ability to maintain concentration will improve with practice. That is enough to get you out. A couple of quick things. The first few times you do it, you will most likely feel fear. That is normal and will go away after your first few experiences. Also, once you feel yourself going, you will probabl y get excited. That is the fastest way to end the experience. For me, it got to the point where I didn't care anymore. I was so sick of finally getting out only to get excited and end it. My apathy was the key to success. Staying calm and passive i s key. Good luck and let me know how it goes. #2 Concentration The goal of concentrating is to keep yourself (you mind) from falling asleep along with your body. As far as what to concentrate on, I will give you some examples. Different thi ngs will work for different people. The thing I have had most success with is as follows: As I am going to sleep (or back to sleep in the case of \"middle of the night\" or \"afternoon nap\" attempts) I watch the darkness behind my eyelids. You pro bably have noticed that it's not simply dark. There is movement; kind of like a gray lava lamp. This does two things for me: 1) It gives me something to focus or concentrate on so I can stay awake and 2) it allows me to ignore your my in the same way I may not be aware of how I am sitting while watching TV or a movie. In the case of 2) above, this will help your body fall asleep. What is really interesting is that after I do this for a while and my body starts to fall asleep, I will begin to see hypnogogic imagery. When that starts to happen, I watch the images like I was watching a movie. A key element here is that when I say \"watch a movie\" I mean in a PASSIVE sense. I don't try to influence what I see. I attempt to detach myself as much as possible. This passiveness, I believe, helps the body go to sleep. Further, it has been my experience that during an OBE, an apathetic or passive attitude is key to prolonging the event. Any excitement and it is over. This can be one of the biggest challenges. An alternative to \"watching the movie\" method is to repeat a word such as \"Focus\" or \"Relax\". Or, you might try counting to 20 over and over."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"If you have just come out of a dream in the middle of the night, you could concent rate on visualizing the dream you just had. Using this last method, I have actually initiated a Wake Induced Lucid Dream (WILD). Finally, you might try a combination of the methods above. The variation can improve your chances of staying awake. In all the methods described, the key is practice. I can't tell you the number of times I thought I was concentrating well only to suddenly find it was morning and I had fallen asleep. One momentary slip in concentration and you will likely fall a sleep. Your ability to concentrate and stay awake improves with practice. METHODS: Hypnagogic Method The hypnagogic state can be described as the state between sleep and waking, in which spontaneous images and sounds go through your head, l asting only a few seconds each. You're still semiconscious in this state, so astral projection can be achieved here. Transform a picture, color, shape, etc. into a portal in which you can begin astral travel. For example, if you start seeing all sorts of s hapes floating everywhere, mentally transform them into tunnels, windows, doors, or 3 - d figures that you can step into and use as a bridge to the astral. Rope Method Visualize a rope coming from your most active chakra. If you are not sure of your most active chakra, see it coming out from the place that would seem most comfortable to you. Astral projector Robert Bruce suggests that you don't actually try to see the rope; see yourself trying to climb this robe in darkness, so you only feel what you are doing. Imagine you are reaching out and climbing the robe. After a while, you may start to feel a moving sensation in your hands or torso. Try not to focus on the sensations you are feeling, but keep focused on what you are doing instead. When you find yourself free of your body, try not to get too excited, and focus on where you are trying to go. Lucid Dream Method You can use this when you find yourself in a lucid dream. First off, I'd like to give you a few tips to induce lucid dreams. Severa l times through the day, try looking at your watch once, looking away, and looking back and asking yourself if you're dreaming. This habit may carry over in your dreams. In your dream, the numbers will most likely change between the first time and the seco nd time you look at it. Once you realize this is a dream, tell yourself that you wish to astral project. Another method for inducing lucid dreams is to tell yourself several times before going to sleep, \"I am dreaming,\" or \"I am having a lucid dream.\" Or y ou may wish to form this into a question if you feel it will work better for you. Once again, if you do realize you are having a dream later, tell yourself to astral project. This method is a little more difficult because you have less control over it, but it still works. "},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Bar Method This one is a little similar to the rope method. Once you've gotten relaxed and your physical body is feeling heavy, start visualizing a bar above you, within reaching distance. Feel your astral arms reaching up and grab bing onto the bar, and slowly start swaying your astral body back and forth. Start with small increments at first, and work you way up to larger swaying. Eventually, you should feel yourself swaying enough to work your way out of your body. Chakra Me thod This is one in which you project yourself out through one of your chakras. To discover which chakra you would like to use, check my page on chakras here. Once you have chosen the one you believe is your strongest chakra, cleanse and balance each cha kra, especially the one you have chosen. Try to feel the energy flowing through your chakras. Try to focus your consciousness on the area of the chakra that you have chosen, until you feel as if you truly are situated in that area. Now try to open the chak ra even further, and will yourself to slip through that opening. From here you should be free to travel where you wish. Push and Pull Method The purpose of this exercise is to induce the swaying motion that will allow you to separate from your phys ical body. Visualize a cord attached to your third eye chakra, or another chakra of your choice. Now visualize your spirit guide holding the other end of the cord. Watch as they begin to gently pull on the cord and then relax their grip. After a while, you may begin to feel yourself swaying. Keep up with this, seeing the guide gradually beginning to pull more and more as the swaying increases, until you are free from your physical body. Vibrational Method Many times you may feel vibrations or hear a buzzing sound as you are close to separating from your physical body. In this method, you must imagine that you are hearing a buzzing sound. After a while, you may actually tune in enough to hear a buzzing sound without having to imagine it. Slowly try to raise the pitch so that it matches that of your astral body. You will probably begin to feel vibrations, and as you raise the pitch of the buzzing sound, you will also raise the vibrations you are feeling, until you feel you are ready to separate. Step one: Relax the body. According to Monroe, \"the ability to relax is the first prerequisite, perhaps even the first step itself\" to having an OBE (out of body experience). This includes both physical and mental relaxation. Monroe does not suggest a method of attaining this relaxation, although Progressive Muscle relaxation, coupled with deep breathing exercises (inhale 1, exhale 2, inhale 3.... until 50 or 100) are known to work well. Step two: Enter the state bordering sleep. This is known as the h ypnagogic state. Once again, Monroe doesn't recommend any method of doing this. One way is to hold your forearm up, while keeping your upper arm on the bed, or ground. As you start to fall asleep, your arm will fall, and you will awaken again. With practic e, you can learn to control the Hypnagogic state without using your arm. Another method is to concentrate on an object. When other images start to enter your thoughts, you have entered the Hypnagogic state. Passively watch these"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"images. This will also help you maintain this state of near - sleep. Monroe calls this Condition A. Step three: Deepen this state. Begin to clear your mind. Observe your field of vision through your closed eyes. Do nothing more for a while. Simply look through your closed eyel ids at the blackness in front of you. After a while, you may notice light patterns. These are simply neural discharges. They have no specific effect. Ignore them. When they cease, one has entered what Monroe calls Condition B. From here, one must enter an even deeper state of relaxation which Monroe calls Condition C -- a state of such relaxation that you lose all awareness of the body and sensory stimulation. You are almost in a void in which your only source of stimulation will be your own thoughts. The id eal state for leaving your body is Condition D. This is Condition C when it is voluntarily induced from a rested and refreshed condition and is not the effect of normal fatigue. To achieve Condition D, Monroe suggests that you practice entering it in the m orning or after a short nap. Step Four: Enter a state of Vibration. This is the most important part of the technique, and also the most vague. Many projectors have noted these vibrations at the onset of projection. They can be experienced as a mild tingling, or as is electricity is being shot through the body. Their cause is a mystery. It may actually be the astral body trying to leave the physical one. For entering into the vibrational state, he offers the following directions: Remove all j ewelry or other items that might be touching your skin. Darken the room so that no light can be seen through your eyelids, but do not shut out all light. Lie down with your body along a north - south axis, with your head pointed toward magnetic north . Loosen all clothing, but keep covered so that you are slightly warmer than might normally be comfortable. Be sure you are in a location where, and at a time when, there will be absolutely no noise to disturb you. Enter a state of relaxation Give yourself the mental suggestion that you will remember all that occurs during the upcoming session that will be beneficial to your well - being. Repeat this five times. Proceed to breath through your helf - open mouth. As you breath, concentrate on the void in front of you. "},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Select a point a foot away from your forehead, then change your point of mental reference to six feet. Turn the point 90 degrees upward by drawing an imaginary line parallel to your body axis up and above your head. Fo cus there and reach out for the vibrations at that point and bring them back into your body. Even if you don't know what these vibrations are, you will know when you have achieved contact with them. Step five: Learn to control the vibrational s tate. Practice controlling them by mentally pushing them into your head, down to your toes, making them surge throughout your entire body, and producing vibrational waves from head to foot. To produce this wave effect, concentrate of the vibrations and men tally push a wave out of your head and guide it down your body. Practice this until you can induce these waves on command. Once you have control of the vibrational state, you are ready to leave the body. Step six: Begin with a partial seperation. T he key here is thought control. Keep your mind firmly focused on the idea of leaving the body. Do not let it wander. Stray thought might cause you to lose control of the state. Now, having entered the vibrational state, begin exploring the OBE by releasing a hand or a foot of the \"second body\". Monroe suggests that you extend a limb until it comes in contact with a familiar object, such as a wall near your bed. Then push it through the object. Return the limb by placing it back into coincidence with the phy sical one, decrease the vibrational rate, and then terminate the experiment. Lie quietly until you have fully returned to normal. This exercise will prepare you for full seperation. Step seven: Disassociate yourself from the body. Monroe suggests t wo methods for this. One method is to lift out of the body. To do this, think about getting lighter and lighter after entering this vibrational state. Think about how nice it would be to float upward. Keep this thought in mind at all costs and let no extra neous thoughts interrupt it. An OBE will occur naturally at this point. Another method is the \"Rotation method\" or \"roll - out\" technique. When you have achieved the vibrational state, try to roll over as if you were turning over in bed. Do not attempt to ro ll over physically. Try to twist your body from the top and virtually roll over into your second body right out of your physical self. At this point, you will be out of the body but next to it. Think of floating upward, and you should find yourself f loating above the body. Monroe suggets you begin with the lift - out method, but argues that both are equally efficacious. Good luck! "},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Energy Balls This is a really fun one. You can even make it into a game. What you're going to do here is to ma ke little balls of energy and then send it to whatever you want. You can send it to yourself, a friend, to achieve a goal, etc. Rub your hands together for about 15 seconds. This is supposed to stimulate the hand chakras. Now cup your hands together. Start to visualize energy coming to your hands and building up in the shape of a ball. It can be any color you want (certain colors work best for different things) but for beginners it's usually easiest to visualize white light. Just see the energy coming from the air around you, and slowly building up, becoming a ball of pure energy. After a while, my hands usually start to tingle, or I can see the ball. Try to do it until you feel your hands tingle. It might take a few times, but if you keep it up, you'll prob ably start to feel it after a while. Once you have the ball to the size you want it at, throw it with a physical movement of your hands and visualize it going where you want it. You can simply visualize it if you want (without moving your hands as if y ou are throwing it) but the physical action will probably make it more powerful and finalized. You can send it off to anything you want, or you can keep it a while and play with it. My friends and I usually make the energy balls and throw it to each other for a while. They get surprised when they find out that they can actually feel the energy landing in their hands. Here's another method if the on above is too hard to do: You need to clear your mind, try focusing on a flame or a picture, you know. once you think your ready, hold your hands like your holding a ball. relax your mind completely and flex all the muscles in your arm. then close your eyes and let the energy flow. :) after a while, you'll probly feel your arms slowly pushing apart or perhaps t ingling, heat, or, if your eyes are open by this time, faint flashes of light. this is getting longer than i expected, so i need to wrap it up. ;) the best conditions for begginers are a dimly lit room and a strong emotion (anger, frightend, ect.) After a long wait ive seen mine! thats it pretty much. Good luck Meditation Technique for developing Psychic Skills The Chakras: Much is said and taught about the chakras and secondary energy centers. Learn all you can about energy in the body, and out side the body. learn all you can about the aura, and how the chakras relate to it. You must be able to identify and FEEL each chakra for this exercise. For the first five minutes Relax yourself. Depply relax and put your full, deep trust in the holin ess of Spirit. I suggest praying to Spirit for guidance and PROTECTION, before you begin any spiritual work or exercise. BELIEVE, if you do not know, that only good spirits are around you, loving you and protecting you. Thank them and open yourself to them for their assistance, BY UPLIFTING YOUR SPIRIT TO THEM. It is said that if you uplift yourself ten feet, they'll come down twenty feet to guide you. Eight - fold Breath: Breathe in for the count of eight. Hold for the count of four. Exhale for the count of eight. Hold for the count of four. You may also begin the breathing with several large full breaths, all the way to the lower abdominal area. Then continue with the eight/four/eight/four breathing. This is"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"very relaxing, and trance inducing. It also be gins to bring you a regulated pattern of energy for the work ahead. Continue the breathing throughout the meditation. And don't worry if you forget it for a time. Just pick it up again and be relaxed about the whole process. This breathing can be extended LATER ON for other types of mediumship. But for now, just do it as explained. Beginning at the Crown chakra. [This is the opposite from what most of you are being taught. Drawing energy upward is what is usually done. But I am showing you, simply, what I learned. Although the other way is certainly worthy of experimentation.] So, beginning with the crown chakra, feel it opening up and becoming charged with light and energy by focusing and intending energy to move into it. Move to the third - eye chakra. O pen/intend/charge this. Throat chakra, the same. Heart chakra, the same. And on down the chakras until all are open and charged up. If one is stuck, or wont cooperate, stay on it, breathing in and out and focusing the incoming, good energy into that chakra . Give the same amount of energy to each one, for this exercise. Turn your attention to the place of visions, the third eye: When the chakras are all open, and you are continuing to breathe as stated, it is time to look within. Find the place inside yo ur mind where you see pictures, where you day - dreAm. [If you have never seen an internalized picture, this is a good time to begin. However, if I say, \"apple!\" How do you know what an apple looks like? Describe it to yourself. See the apple as you describe it to yourself. Where you see this picture inside your mind, is the place I am referring to.] For the next FIVE MINUTES, quiet your thinking, and just practice observing whatever may arise in this space. Do not give it any credence, do not judge what you see. In fact be as non - judgemental as youpossibly can be. Make no decisions based on what comes. Do not get caught in a prolonged image, let it go. Do not indulge yourself in fear, or panic about something which may seem awful . . . just bless it and send it on its way! Try to recall that you have protected yourself and that you are loved. CLOSE DOWN for the next five minutes. Continue the breathing. Go back down the chakras, as before, diminishing the energy, dimming the light, so to speak, and envisio ning that you are CLOSING EACH SPIRITUAL DOOR as you do so. Do each of the chakras in this way, until whatever is open is closed, envisioned as sealed. No spirit activity is permitted from this point on. Reject it. Let spirit information come to you only w hen you desire it, or want it, or permit it. Learn to condition yourself to not accept any information coming from spirits unless you give it your okay. Once the spiritual doors are closed, that means just that, they're closed. Hands should be placed p alms up on lap if working with spirits is desired. Palms down on thighs, if you are trying to work on dreams, or any inner - work. This meditation should be done with eyes closed. In the beginning with a dim light on. It could be done in a group setting an d is an excellent group meditation practice. For a group setting I recommend a tightly closed room, no light getting in from the outseide. Use a small red light overhead, attached to a dimmer switch, and keep turning the light down as your eyes get used to it. In this setting, meditation can be preacticed with the eyes open. Be sure to enter and leave these circumstances with a loving heart and mind. One of trust and never foreboding! Pray for protection and guidance and DEVELOPMENT! Give your thanks to t he Earth, and to the spirits who would come to you so that you may grow. "},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" Astral Guides This text is about how to call a spiritual guide that helps you on your journeys. Everyone , form the youngest child to the oldest person can and should know, and communicate with their spirit guides. A spirit guide is a being of light , advanced to the point where they have no need to return to earth in the flesh anymore . These guides have been with us for centuries , lifetime after lifetime , and wi ll guide us through this life, to purification when we pass on , and they will be with us when we take our first breath if and when we return for another lifetime .That is why it is of extreme importance that we realise that people we knew and loved in thi s lifetime cannot be our guides . All souls, when they pass have to go through a process of purification , it takes years and years to prepare them for either another lifetime here or to pass on to another plane of consciousness. That cannot be accomplishe d in one lifetime. Many people feel loved ones near and it comforts them to think that these souls are helping them , but unfortunately this is not the case . Perhaps in the future we will be able to talk about our recently departed and how we can reall y help lost souls to find their way . These are not evil , spirits , they are just spirits that had unfinished business, that want to be close to loved, ones or that died through trauma and really don't know they have passed. It is not a healthy thing to k eep these souls close , they can cause us all sorts of illness and mental maladies. Then we have the evil entities , those who are either sent to us to cause us harm , or for some reason have found us and attached themselves to us and cause us great ha rm both physical and spiritual. I tell you about all these different spirits because you must grow to recognise the FEEL of them so that you wont make mistakes. STEP 1 relax your entire body , make yourself comfortable with your surroundings , remem ber that nothing , will happen unless you allow it to happen . STEP 2create a mental picture of what your main guide looks like . Feature by feature , characteristic by characteristic this is called seeing your guide , this takes about half an hour , d escribe the picture you see mentally to yourself as thought you were describing a person to another . By now you may notice a slight change of temperature either way , warm or cold. STEP 3name your guide , after you have a complete mental picture, ask the guide his/her name , the absolute first name that pops in your head is right . Trust your instinct , the guide is talking to you even though you are not physically hearing them . Now your guide has a name and you will call your guide by that name from now on. By now you may be able to detect a faint scent and the temperature change should be more pronounced . You are now feeling your guide. The feel of the guide should be warm and comfortable, if it is uncomfortable in any way , stop immediately , this is NOT your guide."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" STEP 4communicate with the guide , let the guide take you to a higher plane ask him frequent questions about your life , past lives and surroundings .

Spiritual healing makes bot h the healer and the person being healed feel great. It can create feelings of great friendship, compassion, peace, and of being in touch with the universe. Benefits can be felt immediately after beginning to learn healing, and the skills continue to im prove for years. Healing is a constant challenge to keep growing, for both the healer and the people being healed. The healer is healed by helping others heal. There are many forms of spiritual healing in existence, from both Western and Eastern philoso phies. Chakra work and aura healing will be covered here as a basic overview. If you would like more information, check the list of references at the end of the book. Regardless of the form of healing used, the healer must put their own needs ahead of o thers' needs. A healer who only heals others and not themselves will burn out quickly. Healing others should not be used as a way of avoiding personal problems. While healing others can contribute to preparing to heal the self, this must not be done so tot ally that the healer tires and has a lower quality of life because of it. Self sacrifice benefits no one in the long term. A healthy healer can do much more than an ill one. Chakras Chakras are places on the body where spiritual energy is converted t o physical energy for growth and happiness. There are seven major chakras and more than twenty minor ones. Chakras are generally seen as spinning energy funnels, skinny near the body and opening up farther from it. Chakra one points downward from the ba se of the spine. Chakra seven points upward from the top of the head. The rest are horizontal through the body, with a funnel in front and another in back. Each chakra other than the root and crown has a front and a back side to it. The front side relates to feelings, and the back side relates to willpower and action. The major chakras are numbered from the bottom up, one through seven. The seven major chakras and their functions are described here."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" Each chakra has a color, name, and function associated with it. Adding energy of a certain color to the chakra of that color will make that chakra function more easily. Blocks in a certain chakra, either caused emotionally or by physical injury, often cause problems in the related area of life. Cleaning the ch akras out and re - energizing them helps overcome those problems.

The most common is to visualize energy entering the chakras, spinning them more smoothly, and clearing out blockages. Putting energy into a chakra that is the same color as that chakra increases the speed of the spin and the energy that the chakra has. Energy of the complementary color slows the chakra slightly, which can be useful for chakras that have become sore from working too hard. Complementary Colors Red \u0000 Green \u0000 \u0000 Blue \u0000 Orange \u0000 \u0000 Yellow \u0000 Purple \u0000 \u0000 White \u0000 Black \u0000 \u0000 Starting from the root chakra works b est for cleaning them because energy is drawn up through the root chakra into each chakra above it and then exits out the top. By starting at the root, you can observe the flow of energy until it moves into a chakra that is blocked, and then do extra work on that chakra to open it before moving on. Start by placing your hand on the root chakra and drawing beautiful red energy into it. See the energy coming up from the earth, as mist or fog or wind or fire or anything, into the root chakra. Imagine the ro ot chakra opening wider and spinning smoothly. If you feel resistance to the energy, relax and think about what might be causing the resistance. Remember that the root chakra governs physical survival and fight or flight responses. Consider any experien ces you have had related to those ideas that you haven't fully accepted yet. Forgive yourself for anything you feel you did wrong, and let go of the event. Continue to gently add energy to the chakra. If you still feel resistance, continue investigating ex periences you have had that might be blocking the chakra. Keep working with your feelings and experiences until you feel the chakra open and clear comfortably. Be very loving to yourself; work gently and carefully with your energy and forgive yourself f or everything you feel bad about. Guilt only blocks energy, which creates more problems in the future, so release the feelings of guilt and move on. Recognize that the choices you make are the best"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"you could make at the time, and you learn from everything, regardless of how things appear. Eventually the chakra will feel as open as you can comfortably make it in this session, which means you are ready to move on. If you cannot clear all of the blocks in one session, do the best you can and come back to wo rk on the rest in another session later. Next, move your hand to the sacral chakra and work on it. Remember that the chakra goes out the back of the body, too. As you work on it, feel the energy moving into both the front and back sides. Feel red energy a nd orange energy rising up through the root chakra into the sacral chakra. The energy swirls together and helps the sacral chakra open and spin more smoothly. Just as you did for the root chakra, be aware of any blocks in the energy flow. Investigate any t roubling experiences or feelings you have in the areas of creativity, sexuality, and relationships. This chakra is sometimes damaged the most due to neglect, abuse, self hatred, lack of self acceptance about sexuality, doubt about creative abilities, an d unwillingness to accept that one's own sexuality doesn't always match societal expectations. The sacral chakra may need to be reconnected to the heart chakra if love and sex have been psychologically separated; do so by feeling cords of energy rejoining the heart and the sacral chakras. Repressive attitudes, fear of being out of control, and fear of one's own sexuality can cause much damage to this chakra, which prevents energy from moving through it into the higher chakras. Full loving acceptance of all parts of the self, especially sexual expression, are needed to open the sacral chakra cleanly. When you feel the sacral chakra open comfortably, move on. Place your hand on the solar plexus chakra and feel energy moving into it. Red, orange, and yell ow energy rises from the ground, through the root and sacral chakras, and into the solar plexus chakra. Once again, open yourself to recognize any blocks in the energy and accept the experiences that may be blocking it. When you feel you have worked throug h as many of the blocks as possible, move up to the heart chakra. Continue with each chakra, drawing all colors of energy in through the root chakra and up, energizing both the front and the back of each chakra. If you feel a lower chakra closing before you have moved through all of the chakras, pause and redo the energy cleaning for that chakra. Then move up through each of the chakras again until you have opened a path from the root chakra into the crown chakra. As you finish work with the crown cha kra, feel the current of energy moving throug \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 smoothly through you.

If you get bored or tired, find something else to do, but don't le t yourself avoid coming back to the chakra cleansing. Avoiding chakra cleaning usually shows that you do not feel you are worthy of being taken care of and are avoiding caring for yourself, or you are avoiding dealing with issues from your past.
