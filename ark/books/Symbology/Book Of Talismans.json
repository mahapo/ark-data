The Psychic and Magnetic Influence of Talismans and Gems. FROM remotest times, back even to the birth of humanity, Precious Stones and Talismans have been held in high estimation by all nations ; the former, primarily because of their beauty, and the latter on account of their virtues, as trans- mitters of good luck and to avert misfortune. The association of Gems with power, civil and religious, has ever been noticeable; and to the fascination of antiquity may be added the allurement of mystery. Moreover, of the many and varied signs of wealth and luxury, jewels have played a most important part in the lives of the great, not only on account of their beauty but because they contained in a small compass the equivalent to a large sum of money and in times of danger could easily be concealed and carried from place to place. 3"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"4 THE BOOK OF TALISMANS As tokens or symbols they conveyed joy and confidence to their owners, and were thought to give warning of coming events, inspiring courage and faith in the fearful, and the romances and tragedies in which they have played a part, together with their marked influence on the lives of indi- viduals and nations, intensifies our interest in them so that it is little wonder that faith in the mysterious properties ascribed to them should have survived the growth of ages and still find so many believers in all countries. The philoso- phers of thousands of years ago, understanding their suitability as a medium for the trans- mission of astral forces and vibrations, in- vested them with much importance, attributing to them spiritual as well as material powers, special characteristics and medicinal and curative qualities. In all probability gems had their origin in the very remote period of the Earth's history when it was still in a molten state subject to deluge and fire, before its solidification made it possible for vegetation to appear, and the translucent lustre of certain gems is due to the action of the floods which preceded the fiery volcanic period. The colouring which forms their greatest fascination is due to various metallic oxides in combination with oxygen which in varying quantities gives red,"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"ORIGIN OF GEMS 5 blue, yellow, or green colourings, as shown by the Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Topaz, and Amethyst. It is most difficult to determine with any cer- tainty in what country Precious Stones were first worn as ornaments, but the consensus of opinion seems to point to India, as far as recognised his- tory is concerned, as their birthplace, for every rare and beautiful production of Nature, Gems and Pearls are associated with the East. The earliest records of humanity do not, how- ever, stop with known histories, for traces of man's love for gems are found in the discoveries of travellers and the traditions of South America, evidence proving an inheritance from past civilisations of great antiquity. There is an innate attraction to the marvellous in mankind, the imagination lead- ing us to endow the rare and precious with peculiar qualities, particularly when the source of its beauty and rarity is not readily perceptible. It is akin to the extraordinary magnetic influence which one person may exercise over another without any. tangible evidence of super-physical powers, or the mysterious attraction which the Magnet exercises over Iron, and establishes the inference that other minerals may be similarly endowed with properties at present unrecognised by our ordinary physical senses. Modern research confirms the old teaching that"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"6 THE BOOK OF TALISMANS the Universe was created from the four elements, Fire, Air, Water, Earth, in the order given, each growing as it were from its predecessor and all animated in turn by the Word breathed upon them at the Creation ; this force, or energy, per- meates all existing things from man, who is the highest of apparent physical manifestations down through the animal and vegetable kingdoms to the mineral, in which this energy, by reason of its very slow atomic changes, is least obvious. This Force manifests in the form of vibrations moving in waves through every composite part of the physical world, and, according to the condition of its medium, helping and giving power when in harmony, and thwarting or nullifying action when under unfavourable conditions. To this Force, or Etheric influence, is due the law of Evolution, or progress, which operates in every department of the Universe, not being confined to any one kingdom, but harmonising each with the other, being naturally most powerful in man whose evolution is the highest, and forms the medium through which man can act on the lower kingdoms and receive desired vibrations from them. We may thus interpret Plato's statement \" that gems owe their origins to the stars \" as an etheric influence acting on the auriferous matter which forms their composition."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"PSYCHOMETRY 7 Evidence of undoubted authenticity of won- derful occult powers and experiences has within recent years become readily accessible to all. Psychometry [the art of sensing past happenings to individuals from the handling of something belonging to them, such as a glove or jewel] may be said to be established as a fact ; and that this power is not confined to human affairs but permeates also the lower kingdoms is aptly illus- trated by a personal experience which occurred during the summer of 1912. Mr. J. Wedgewood of the Theosophical Society, who is much interested in sensing colours from the touch of Precious Stones, and with whom I have frequently experimented in this direction, called one day at my office with a lady friend, Mrs. Russak, also of the Theosophical Society, and a well-known occultist. In the course of conversation Mr. Wedgewood said, \" If you want to know anything about any of your stones, this lady can tell you,\" and, being desirous of getting a real test, I selected two new stones that I knew had never been used, as will be seen by what follows : I handed one to Mrs. Russak which she held in the palm of her hand for a moment or so, and then gave me what was, as far as I could judge, a description of the processes of its formation ; then, holding it out to me, went on to say, \" I am sorry I cannot give you any events connected"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"8 THE BOOK OF TALISMANS with this stone, but within the last month you have changed its centre of gravity.\" The stone was a Jargoon that I had only just received back from the lapidary with whom I had left it in the rough to be cut ; it was a very decided oval in shape whilst in its rough state, and the lapidary had advised me to have practically half of it cut away, leaving the stone quite circular and only about half its original size, although much more valuable and finer in colour than it would have been had it been cut as an oval twice the size. The second stone was a piece of Lapis Lazuli, and after holding this for a while the Seer said, \" I only get warm friendly vibrations from this stone, and as far as I can tell it has had no history as a finished stone ; but it must have come into your possession under very kindly conditions.\" The stone in question had been cut from a large piece of Lapis Lazuli given to me in its natural rough uncut form by a client, in recognition of quite a slight service I had rendered her, but which had played a rather important part in her life. This ability to gauge and come into touch with the soul of things is unfortunately at present only confined to the few, although innate in every human being, and must be regarded as a latent sense which will be common to coming generations,"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"ANCIENT DESCRIPTIONS 9 opening up realms hitherto undreamt of and making a decided forward step in human evolution. Confusion and doubt have arisen as to the exact stones mentioned by the early writers, owing to their elastic methods of describing all red stones as Rubies, all green stones as Emeralds, and all blue stones as Sapphires ; this confusion has not been lessened by reason of the complexity of the many languages of the East, to say nothing of the artistic liberties taken by modern poets and authors, (who, probably unaware of the necessity for astronomical or astrological knowledge as a basis for the Zodiacal placing of the stones,) have taken our calendar as it stands for the Month stones with such embellishments as their fancy dictated. The Precious Stones ascribed to the twelve months of the year were those worn in the breast- plate of the High Priest, and it was believed that the Divine revelations obtained by the shining or dullness of the stones in the Urim and Thummim, due to some virtue inherent in them, were indica- tive as to whether the atonement had been accepted or not. These twelve stones, engraved with twelve anagrams of the name of God, had a mystic power over the Zodiac, harmonising the twelve Angels and good Spirits who had affinity with the twelve tribes of Israel."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"io THE BOOK OF TALISMANS The origin of Talismans and Amulets is lost in the obscurity of the ages, but as far back as we can trace human records they are to be found ; the terms Talisman and Amulet have become from indiscriminate use to be considered synonymous, but in his notes to the Archceological Journal, the Rev. C. W. King says : \" The meaning of these two words is entirely distinct. Talisman being the conception in the Arabic tongue of the Greek, meaning the influence of a planet, or the Zodiac, upon the person born under the same. A Talisman in olden times was, therefore, by its very nature a sigil, or symbolic figure, whether engraved in stone or metal, or drawn upon parchment or paper, and was worn both to procure love and to avert danger from its possessor. The latter purpose alone was the object of the Amulet, its Latin signification being to do away with, or baffle, its root being Amalior. Pliny cites the word as the country-folk name for the Cyclamen which ought to be planted in every human home, because where it is grown poisonous drugs have no power to harm, on which account they call it the flower, Amuletum.\" The belief in them is by no means so universal as in olden times, and to the thoughtful person many of the attributes claimed for them cannot be admitted ; at the same time, with the growing"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"SYMBOLS AS THE BASIS OF CHARMS n knowledge of finer forces opening up new powers to mankind and to which we are slowly coming into touch, many people are prepared to admit that there may be some active power in a thought made concrete in the form of a Talisman or Amulet which may be made for some specific purpose, or for particular wear, becoming to the wearer a continual reminder of its purpose and undoubtedly strengthening him in his aims and desires. Symbols, frequently of a religious nature, have formed the basis of Talismans and Charms from earliest times, holding a very important place in the affairs of humanity, for symbolism was a power before civilisation was evolved, and by its recognition of a certain order in physical affairs it was undoubtedly a great factor in the establish- ment of human laws. In modern religions this law is recognised by the use of each symbol in accordance with the character of ceremonial worship, colour also playing a very important part in the service. Too frequently one hears a religion condemned as idolatrous because its God or Gods were typified in human or animal form. That it was the virtue the figure represented, and not the figure itself that was venerated, is ignored; but Christians would be indignant if the use of the Lamb and Eagle as symbols in their"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"12 THE BOOK OF TALISMANS services caused them to be accused of idolatrous worship of these emblems ! The force of the Spirit behind the symbol is very apparent with regard to the Cross, as may be understood when we think of the martyrs who have endured unflinchingly the most excruciating tortures human brain could devise, holding fast to their faith by this symbol. The savage had his Totem, which he believed gave him certain virtues, and helped him to success in his combats and in his struggle for existence. Those of our readers who have any knowledge of Astrology and Planetary influences will readily understand the sympathy between any metal, or stone, ruled by any particular planet, and any person coming under the influence of that planet. In the writing of the philosophers and Alchemists of the Middle Ages directions are given that these Talismans should be made, or commenced, under favourable aspects, so that the Work may receive the vitalising rays proceeding from the planet represented."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"CHAPTER II Talismans of Primitive Races The Axe Arrow-head The Swastika The Serpent The Interlaced Triangles. A MONGST primitive races the Axe was the 1~\\ symbol for Chief, God, or Divine Being, and had its origin in the Neolithic or later Stone Age, which ended in Europe about 2000 B.C. It was doubtless the earliest weapon of prehis- toric man, and in addition to its uses as a weapon would have been in constant service in clearing the way when moving from place to place, and in cutting and shaping the wood used in forming his shelters. This being so, it is easy to con- ceive of its association with strength, power, and utility ; and its symbolic use to express these virtues is a logical conclusion, whilst from remains found in various parts of the world it is evident that its use for this purpose was universal, and amongst primitive races the Axe became the recognised hieroglyphic for God, Chief, or Ruler ; moreover, as a symbol of power, its place is taken by the State Sword 13"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"14 THE BOOK OF TALISMANS which is carried before the King at important ceremonies even to the present day.

THE ARROW-HEAD in its symbolism had a similar significance to that of the Axe, and in Japan flint Arrow-heads were thought to have been rained from Heaven, or dropped by flying spirits. They were very popular in the early days of the present civilisation as Amulets to protect the wearer from disease and to avert the Evil Eye ; whilst throughout Europe they were re- garded as the product of Elves (Elf-shots, or fairy weapons), water in which they had been dropped or dipped, being considered very efficacious in"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"PRIMEVAL, CHINESE, INDIAN AND THIBETAN TALISMANS.

THE SWASTIKA, one of the oldest and certainly the most universal Talisman known, can be traced back to the Neolithic Age, and it has been found engraved on stone implements of this period. It is to be met with in all parts of the Old and New Worlds and on the most ancient ruins and remains, it thus living through the Ages in active use down to the present time. In spite of its antiquity and the fact that some writers quote it as being in use among the Egyptians, we have not been able to find it, as a symbol used by them, amongst their remains in the British Museum, and authorities whom we have con- sulted are also unaware of its existence in Egyptian records. It was used long before its present name was given it, and extensive discussion has been carried on as to whether its correct form is with its arms turned to the left, or to the right, without, as far as we have been able to ascertain, any definite conclusion being arrived at. Both forms seem equally popular, and are so found in all countries ; whilst on the rock walls of the Buddhist caves of India they are used in great numbers, with their arms turned both ways often in the course of the same inscription,"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"16 THE BOOK OF TALISMANS In Sanskrit its name means Happiness, Pleasure, Good Luck, Su good, or well ; Asti being, making it = \" Good Being \" ; and it is still used in India, China, and Japan as an Amulet for long life, good fortune, and good luck. The illustration shown on Plate I, No. 14 is from a shield of the Bronze Age, the background being of dull red enamel, and the arms turned to the left ; whilst No. 18, which turns to the right, is taken from between the feet of a statue of Buddha from Ceylon, and is also commonly found in the footprints of this Deity, sometimes both forms being used in the same impression. In China the Swastika sign is pronounced Wan, meaning a great number, a multitude, great happiness, longevity ; both forms are used, but most commonly that which is turned to the left. The Jains of India regard it as a symbol of human progress, the right arm A (Illustration No. 18) representing the lowest stage of life, as proto- plasm ; the lower arm B indicating the soul's evolution, and through plant and animal life C representing human evolution, and D the spiritual life, the plane on which the soul is entirely freed from matter by the practice of the three jewels, right belief, right knowledge, and right conduct.

It may occasionally be met with, having five or six limbs, and is then probably intended to represent the Wheel of the law, or Buddha's Wheel ; whilst a three-limbed figure is much used in the Punjaub and other parts of India by the Mohajin Log (the banking, or moneyed class) as a charm which was not only worn, but used as an ornament in their houses, generally over the door.

The fact that this symbol is found universally throughout India, Africa, North and South America, Asia and Europe forms a very strong argument for a common origin lost in the far distant past, and is considered by some writers as evidence of a connection between these con- tinents and the lost continent of Atlantis. THE SERPENT throughout all ages has appealed to the imagination of man, to whom its various characteristics afforded opportunities for symbolic expression ; from its length of life it has been used as the symbol of Eternity, and as a Talisman for Longevity, Health, and Vitality, and when depicted with its tail in its mouth (this form being particularly noticeable in ancient rings) it indi- cates perpetual union, whilst to the Aztecs, who used it in this way as a symbol of the Sun, it signi- fied unending Time, ever beginning, ever creating, and ever destroying, and was considered to have great protective and enduring virtues."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"THE SERPENT 19 When shown coiled, its folds signify succession of ages, and if the tail is hidden, unfathomable antiquity (see Illustration No. 22, Plate I, which is taken from an ancient Japanese example in the British Museum). In primeval days, serpents of the Python family attained huge dimensions, and would naturally be held in dread and awe by early man ; and in all primitive religions we find the belief held that the soul of man passed at death into a serpent to undergo regeneration and renewal, so symbolised because the serpent casts its skin once a year and becomes a new serpent. To the Eastern mind the Sun in its passage through the heavens formed a curve similar to that of the Snake, and by its progression spirally, with great quickness at will, though without feet and hands or organs by which other animals per- form their movements, it was supposed to symbo- lise lightning or fire, the vitalising principle of life in its good aspect, and, when antagonistic, it became typical of evil and misfortune. In Egypt the Serpent in the form of the Urceus was worn round the head as a mark of Royalty, and to symbolise Divine Power, Wisdom, and Energy, every tomb of the Kings yet opened has the Serpent sculptured erect on each side of the doorway to guard and protect the body within."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"20 THE BOOK OF TALISMANS It first became a type of the Evil One when this form was assumed by Sut (after killing Osiris) in his endeavour to escape from the vengeance of Horus. In Indian religions the Serpent is known as Ananta, or endless, a symbol of infinite duration and Eternity ; Vishnu, the Creator, is represented sleeping on this serpent whose numerous heads form a canopy over the God, each giving constant attention to his expected awakening, when new creations and a new order of things will be estab- lished, and was valued as a talisman for Know- ledge, Wisdom, and Understanding. Serpents were sacred to the Great God of Medicine because of the idea that they have the power of renewing their youth by casting their skins, hence the wand of ^Esculapius is repre- sented as entwined by two serpents, the emblem of Medical Science, and in the temple of Epidaurus, the most important sanatorium of the Metropolis, a large serpent was kept, typical of Health and Vitality. As a symbol, it was used in connection with Ceres, Mercury, and Diana in their most beneficent qualities ; whilst Python in monstrous form represented all that was evil.

In its composition the Triangle with its apex upwards symbolises Good, and with the inverted Triangle, Evil : the Triangle with its apex up being typical of the Trinity that exists in all religions ; in India, China, and Japan its three angles represent Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva, the Creator, Preserver, and Destroyer or Regener- ator ; in Egypt it represented Osiris, Isis, and Horus, and in the Christian Church the Holy Trinity. As a whole it stood for the elements of fire and spirit, composed of the three virtues, Love, Truth, and Wisdom. The Triangle with its apex downward represented the element of water, and typified the material world, or the three enemies of the soul, the World, the Flesh, and the Devil, and the cardinal sins, Envy, Hatred, and Malice.

A further instance of significance is that it also figured on the roll-call of the Roman Legions, a Tau Cross being placed against the names of all those who had survived the battle, and a Theta against the slain.

The friars of this order made it their object in life to minister to those afflicted with St. Anthony's Fire, the relics of this saint being believed to be most efficacious in the cure of this complaint. We are also told that this fraternity wore a black habit with the letter T in blue on their breasts, this symbol being known as St. Anthony's Cross. As this saint was habitually invoked for the cure of Epilepsy as well as Erysipelas, the Tau Cross became regarded as a Talisman against both maladies. In the Archczological Journal we note the follow- ing : \" Among Stothard's effigies are those of Sir Roger de Bois and lady, each of whom wears on the right shoulder a circular badge graven with a Tau Cross on which appears the word ANTHON,\" thus testifying to the fact that Sir Roger also belonged to the Brotherhood, whilst in Ireland to this day St. Anthony's Cross is still used as a charm against sickness."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"26 THE BOOK OF TALISMANS AUM, the mystic emblem of the Deity, was first introduced into Europe by the translation of the Gita, in which we are told it is forbidden to be pro- nounced aloud, and in its complete expression is still in universal use as a Talisman throughout Asia. It is usually spelt OM, but being tri-literal seems, according to most Sanskrit scholars, better expressed by AUM, or AOM, or AWM, being formed of the three Sanskrit letters that are best so expressed. The date generally believed for its universal use is the thirteenth century B.C. It represents the Hindu Triad, or triform Deity, three in one, A the Creator, U the Preserver, and M the Destroyer, or Transformer, and is the image of the Ancient of Days ; and in the Book of the Pitris it is written : \" The husband is as ancient as the wife, and the wife is as ancient as the husband, and the son is also as ancient as the husband and wife, and the one that contains all these is called AUM.\" The signification of the invocation AUM MA NI PAD ME HUM (AUM ! the Jewel in the Lotus HUM) is therefore very important, and accounts for the great veneration in which it is held (see Illustra- tion No. I2a, Plate I), and in Buddhism in Thibet, by Waddell, we note that it is stated in the MANI KAHBUM that this charm will bring the greatest happiness, prosperity, all knowledge, and the"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"AUM MA NI PAD ME HUM 27 means of deliverance from enemies and all evil on earth, whilst the devout firmly believe that as they revolve the magical sentence within their prayer- wheels by day and night they are prevent- ing the series of re-births otherwise inevitable, and that when their lives have ended here they will pass straightway to the Paradise of Buddha, for the \" AUM closes re-birth among the gods, MA among the Titans, Ni as a man, PAD as a beast, ME as a Tantalus, and HUM as an inhabitant of Hell.\" To each of these words is given the distinctive colour of these six conditions of re-birth : \" AUM the godly white, MA the Titanic blue, Ni the human yellow, PAD the animal green, ME the tantalic red, HUM hellish black.\" There is also a special Rosary used for the repetition of this charm, composed either of the Conch Shell, or crystal beads ; in use, the right hand is passed through the Rosary, which hangs down knotted end up, and the hand with the"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"28 THE BOOK OF TALISMANS thumb upward is carried to the breast and held there.

INDIAN TALISMANS. In India we find, as in most countries, that Talismans very frequently have religious origins, and representations of the Deities are in common use for the protection of their wearers, as well as for their spiritual and material well-being. A belief in a Trinity of gods is universal, with Brahma as the Creator, Vishnu the Preserver and Restorer, and Siva the Destroyer or Regenerator. In the course of the develop- ments of the various sects Vishnu, originally regarded as a manifestation of Solar energy, became the supreme god, and the worshippers of Vishnu attribute to him all the qualities of the triune gods, his image and various symbols being amongst the most common of Indian Talismans. He is believed to have ten Avataras, or Incarna- tions, in which his spirit descended in human form to effect great reformations and to regenerate the world; the tenth incarnation, yet to come, is for the final destruction of the wicked, and to regenerate and purify the world. Gotama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, was Vishnu's ninth incarnation, and his images and"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"30 THE BOOK OF TALISMANS symbols are extremely popular Talismans for pro- tection and good fortune. Buddhism, which was founded about the fifth century B.C., has estab- lished itself throughout India, China, Ceylon, Japan, Thibet, and Central Asia, inculcating a very high system of theology, the ultimate end of which is Union with the Divine. The Brahmins place Buddha foremost amongst the gods, as opposed to Brahma of the Hindus. Amongst other sects, Siva is regarded as the greatest of the gods, and there is much overlapping amongst these beliefs, and numerous minor gods exist, typifying various virtues and gifted with powers and attributes which bring them into intimate relations with humanity, for which reason their symbols and personifications are in common use as Talismans. Talismans of Ganesa, the elephant-headed god, the son of Siva, (who is regarded as the God of Wisdom and Prudence, and the Remover of obstacles,) are always worn when any important undertaking is begun. He is represented with four arms holding respectively a Lotus, a Shell, a Goad or Club, and the Discus or Wheel, and the rotundity of his body is sym- bolic of his high importance and good standing, and not, as might be supposed, intended as evidence of good living (see Illustration No. 28, Plate II).

He was unequalled in learning, knowledge of medicine, and magic, and his skill and cunning in defeating his enemies were superhuman ; he fought for Rama, who was an incarnation of Vishnu, performing on his behalf prodigious feats of valour. On one occasion, whilst fighting against Ravana the King of Demons, his enemies greased his enormous tail and set it on fire, but only to their own discomfiture, for with it Hanuman burnt down Lanka, their capital city (see Plate 2, No. 29). The eight glorious emblems of Buddha are all used as Talismans ; they consist of the Wheel of the Law, the Conch Shell, the Golden Fish, the Lucky Diagram, the Lotus, the Um- brella, the Vase, and the Trumpet of Victory. Buddha at his birth had the marks of two feet upon his head and a wheel, or disc, in his hand, by which symbols the Pandits foretold that he would become a great ruler.

The wheel was also used to explain the vision seen by a disciple on other spheres, the five spokes divided the Hells, the place of Animals, Ghosts, or evil spirits, Gods, and men (illustrated Plate II, No. 34). THE CONCH SHELL was taken from a demon of the sea by Krishna, who used it for a horn (see Illustration No. 35, Plate II), and is prized as a Talisman for oratory and learning, as well as a bringer of wealth, the latter being no doubt sug- gested by the fact that shells were the current coin of primitive people. THE FISH is the symbol of the first incarnation of Vishnu, who in this form saved Manu from the Flood to become the progenitor of the new race. Because of its fertility it is used as a Talisman for increase of riches, and is illustrated on Plate II, No. 32. THE LUCKY DIAGRAM is very common in Thibet, and is worn as a Talisman for Longevity (see Illus- tration No. 30, Plate II).

Frogs made of amber or gilded metal are also frequently worn as amulets by children in Burmah, that they may not decline in health through the evil glance. Brightly coloured ribbons are hung upon houses and attached to the heads and tails of horses to distract the attention of the Evil Eye, and protect the animals from harm, which probably accounts for the origin of the gaudy decorations we frequently see in our own country tied to the heads and tails of fine cart-horses on their way to the fair or horse show.

The most celebrated \"footprint\" is on Adam's Peak, near Colombo, which attracts from all countries pilgrims who have adopted the religion of Buddha, Mohammed, or the Hindu gods, each claiming it as the Impression of their respective Deities. Sir Gardiner Williamson says that the Mohamme- dans of Egypt show a footprint of the Prophet which gives the name to a village on the banks of the Nile Attar a Nebbee. Herodotus mentions the impression of the foot of Hercules, two cubits in length, on a rock near the bank of the River Tyras, in Scythia. In Italy, tablets dedicated to Isis have been found. From this we gather that this practice of carving footprints on rocks and stone is one which dates from the remote Bronze Age, and that the area over which they are found embraces the whole world. In Thibet, the Lamaist Sceptre, or Dorje, the thunderbolt of Indra, is greatly valued as a Talisman (see Illustration No. 26, Plate II). This symbol is prized as a Talisman against Demons, and to bring fruitfulness. Indra, as the deity of the atmosphere, governs the weather and dispenses the rain, sending forth lightnings and thunder against Ahi the demon of drought, whom he overcomes with his thunderbolt, com- pelling him to pour down the fertilising showers."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"36 THE BOOK OF TALISMANS KNOTS are used in India and Thibet as Talis- mans for Longevity and to avert the Evil Eye (see Illustration No. 27, Plate II), the Knot being considered potent to bind that which is good and precious, and to prove an obstacle or hindrance to that which is evil ; for instance, at the time of marriage knots are lucky, and the ceremonies connected with a Chinese marriage include knotted red and green ribbons, which are held by the newly wedded pair, the bride holding the green ribbon whilst the bridegroom seizes the red ; and in our own country the true-lover's knot is fre- quently used in the decoration of the wedding dress; but at childbirth and death, there must be no knots about the person to hamper the coming or going of the spirit. CHINESE TALISMANS. The origin of the ancient religion of China is unknown, and the faith has been handed down from generation to generation from periods many centuries B.C. It is based on the belief that the Universe was ruled by Divinities arranged in three groups, one ruling the heavens, the second the earth, (having dominion over mountains,) streams, and vegeta- tion, and the third ruling the affairs of mankind.

The Talisman is made of all sizes and shapes, from large ones on boards, one or two feet square, down to tiny medals for personal wear, no larger than a sixpence. It is also frequently used in circular form, as shown in the central part of the Bat Talisman (No. 20, Plate I), and is known as Tho, the symbol of longevity. The Pa-kwa Trigrams are based upon the ancient theory of the Yang Yin, or two first causes, indicated by the circular figure divided by a spiral line in the centre of the Talisman into two equal gadroons, which represent the Creative prin- ciple in its masculine and feminine manifestations ; the active principle being Yang, and the passive Yin. This symbol also represents Heaven and Earth, Sun and Moon, Light and Darkness, and everything that is in contrast, or positive and negative. The whole lines in the figures are described as strong in contrast to the short-divided lines, which are weak, the whole representing the two forms of subtle matter which forms the corapo-"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"38 THE BOOK OF TALISMANS sition of all things.

Confucianism, advocating the fulfilment of all duties to the utmost of one's power, in ac- cordance with the position in life, socially and officially, ranging from the love of the child for his father to the Emperor's responsibility for his people's welfare, is still firmly believed in at the present time ; and the Talisman of the five bats, the Weefuh, is for the five great happinesses that all men desire, Luck, Wealth, Longevity, Health, and Peace. The five bats are frequently used alone, but sometimes, as in Illus- tration No. 20, Plate I, the Trigrams, or some other symbol, is used in conjunction. Two Bats signify good wishes ; a Goose is depicted as a Talisman for domestic felicity, and a Deer for success and honour in study ; a Stork, or Pine Tree, and a fabulous Peach which takes a thousand years in ripening, for longevity and good fortune. Another graceful way of wishing a guest good luck is to depict one of these symbols, or a lucky sentence, at the bottom of his tea-cup, such as \" May your happiness know no bounds,\" enclosed by a border of the five bats.

The Phoenix is believed by the Chinese to uphold their Empire and preside over its destiny ; it is also worn as a Talisman for Longevity and Con- jugal Happiness ; whilst in the mystic sense it typifies the whole world, its head the heavens, its eyes the Sun, its beak the Moon, its wings the wind, its feet the earth, and its tail the trees and plants. To the Japanese the Phoenix, or HO-WO bird, is a Talisman for Rectitude, Obedience, Fidelity, Justice, and Benevolence, and they consider it a manifestation of the Sun, its appearance on earth being considered a portent of great events. The TORII, a kind of gate elaborately carved and decorated at the entrances of Shinto temples, is erected for the Phoenix to perch upon should it visit the earth (see Illustration No. 40, Plate III).

The dragon is worn for Longevity and Domestic Felicity (see Illustration No. 38, Plate III). The type of the Dragon was thought to have been the boa-constrictor, until the researches of geology brought to light in the iguanodon such a near counterpart of the dragon that this is now regarded as more probably its prototype. The Lung is represented as a dragon-headed horse which carries on its back the book of the Law. It is very popular in Thibet, where it is known as the Wind Horse ; but the Lamas have sub- stituted for the book of the Law the emblems of the three gems (see Illustration No. 31, Plate II), which include the Buddhist Law, and is thus worn by the Thibetans to bring material gain, wealth, and good luck ; in this form it is painted on luck- bringing flags, which are hung from the ridges of the houses and in the vicinity of dwellings.

THE MONEY SWORD is regarded as all-powerful against ill-luck to the house and against the ma- chinations of evil spirits, and it attracts cash to its fortunate possessor when suspended from right to left above the head of his bed. This Cash Sword is composed of two iron rods along which a quantity of coins, having holes in the centre, are tied with red silk, making a potent charm which is very popular (see Illustration No. 44, Plate III).

Bells are also worn by Chinese children to avert the Evil Eye and preserve the teeth.

All through life the Chinaman regards him- self as surrounded by demons, to combat whom innumerable charms and amulets are necessary. A favourite charm to keep evil spirits from crossing the threshold is a leaf of the Sweet Flag (Acorus gramineus), or Artemisia, nailed on either side of the doorway ; always providing that the leaf is placed in position early in the morning of the fifth Moon. The Chinese New Year starts when the Sun and Moon are in conjunction, in Aquarius, so that the fifth Moon would be at the time of the conjunction in Gemini.

The sacred dog of Mitsumine is used as a protection from robbers, the god Jurojin, the Stork, the Tortoise, or the Crane for health and longevity.

They are golden fruits upon the great Tree of Life : * male and female He created them.' Isis is the Sister of Osiris because she is of Divine origin like himself, and is a spirit of equal rank. She is his Wife, because she alone can fill his highest cravings. She is his Mother because it is the mission of Woman to restore Man unto spiritual life.\" How Osiris was slain by his brother Typhon (or Set), the Spirit of Evil, and dismembered into fourteen fragments which were scattered and hidden by the destroyer ; how Isis, widowed and broken-hearted, sought patiently until she found each fragment, and how Horus her son when he grew to manhood challenged and conquered Typhon, all this is the figurative rendering of the eternal battle between light and darkness."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"EGYPTIAN TALISMANS 57 Typhon or Set symbolises autumn, decay, and destruction ; Osiris springtime, light, and the fertilising and growing powers of nature. Isis is typified in many forms, but was especially revered as the goddess of procreation, Universal Mother of the living, and protectress of the spirits of the dead. Her symbol was the cow, and she is usually depicted wearing cow's horns, and between them the orb of the moon. But more ancient and more exalted than Osiris was Ra, the Sun god, whose worship was blended with that of Isis and her husband and son. The priests of Ra established a famous temple at Heliopolis, and founded a special system of solar worship. Just as the Emperor Const antine sub- sequently fixed as saints' days in the Christian Church the days which had been dedicated to the ancient pagan gods, so the priests of Ra adapted their cult to the tastes and notions of the people, and a whole company of subordinate gods figured in the religions of Lower Egypt for many centuries. Sometimes divine virtues were portrayed in very material forms. Between 4000 and 2000 B.C. the worship of Amen, or Amen Ra, as the greatest god of the Egyptians, was established at Thebes, which became the centre of religious teaching. The priests grew more and more powerful until finally"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"58 THE BOOK OF TALISMANS the High Priest of Amen whose name means the \" hidden one \" became the King of Upper Egypt. Amen was regarded as the Creator, with all the power and attributes of Ra the Sun god, and as ruler of the lesser gods. It has been asked why the Egyptians, who had no belief in a material resurrection, took such infinite trouble to preserve the bodies of their dead. They looked forward to a paradise in which eternal life would be the reward of the righteous, and their creed inculcated faith in the existence of a spiritual body to be inhabited by the soul which had ended its earthly pilgrimage ; but such beliefs do not explain the care and atten- tion bestowed upon the lifeless corpse. The explanation must be sought in the famous Book of the Dead, representing the convictions which pre- vailed throughout the whole of the Egyptian civilisation from pre-dynastic times. Briefly, the answer to our question is this : there was a Ka or double, in which the Heart-Soul was located ; this Ka, equivalent to the astral body of modern occultists, was believed to be able to come into touch with material things through the preserved or mummified body. This theory accords with the axiom that each atom of physical substance has its relative equivalent on the astral plane. It will therefore be understood how, in the ancient"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"EGYPTIAN TALISMANS 59 religions, the image of a god was regarded as a medium through which his powers could be mani- fested. \" As above, so below \" ; every living thing possessed some divine attribute. Faith in prayer was an essential article of the Egyptian religion, and the spoken word of a priest was believed to have strong potency, because it had been the words of Ra uttered by Thoth which brought the universe into being. Amulets in- scribed with words were consequently thought to ensure the fulfilment of the blessing expressed, or the granting of the bliss desired. The Book of the Dead was not only a guide to the life hereafter, wherein they would join their friends in the realms of eternal bliss, but gave detailed particulars of the necessary knowledge, actions, and conduct during the earthly life to ensure a future existence in the spirit world, where everlasting life was the reward of the good and annihilation the fate of the wicked, thus showing that the belief in the existence of a future life was ever before them. Various qualities, though primarily considered a manifestation of the Almighty, were attributed each to a special god who controlled and typified one particular virtue.

A knowledge of the life, death, and resurrection of Osiris is assumed, and his worship in association with Isis and Horus, although not necessarily under these names, is continuous. Horus is frequently alluded to as the god of the ladder, and the mystic ladder seen by Jacob in his vision, and the ladder of seven steps known to the initiates of Egypt, Greece, Mexico, India, and Persia will be familiar to all students of occultism. Throughout the whole of the Egyptian civilisa- tion, which lasted for at least 6000 years, the in- fluence and potency of Amulets, and Talismans, was recognised in the religious services, each Talis- man and Amulet having a specified virtue. Certain Amulets not only were worn during life, but were even attached to the dead body. They are described in the following notes : THE CRUX ANSATA, or Ankh (see Illustrations Nos. 47, 48, 49, Plate IV), was known as the symbol of life, the loop at the top of the Cross consisting of the hieroglyphic Ru (O) set in an"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"so EGYPTIAN TALISMAN'S.

It was regarded as the key of the Nile which overflowed periodically and so fertilised the land. It was also shown in the hands of the Egyptian kings, at whose coronations it played an important part, and the gods are invariably depicted holding this symbol of creative power ; it was also worn to bring knowledge, power, and abundance. Again, it had reference to the spiritual life, for it was from the Crux Ansata, or Ankh, that the symbol of Venus originated, the Circle over the Cross being the triumph of Spirit, represented by the Circle, over matter, shown by the Cross. THE MENAT (Illustrations Nos. 50, 53, Plate IV) were specially dedicated to Hathor, who was a type of Isis, and was worn for conjugal happi- ness, as it gave power and strength to the organs of reproduction, promoting health and fruitful- ness.

Thoth was the personification of Law and Order, being the god who worked out the Creation as decreed by the god Ra.

In their services the Egyptians associated themselves with Osiris, through whose sufferings and death they hoped to rise glorified and immortal, and secure Ever- lasting Happiness.

From the enormous number of Scarabs that have been found, this must have formed the most popular of the Talismans. The symbol was derived from a Beetle, common in Egypt, which deposits its eggs in a ball of clay, the action of the insect in rolling this ball along the ground being compared with the Sun itself in its progress across the sky ; and as the ball contained the living germ which, (under the heat of the Sun,) hatched out into a Beetle, so the Scarab became the symbol of Creation. It is also frequently seen holding the disc of the Sun between its claws, with wings extended, and it is thought by some authorities that the Scarab was taken as an emblem of the Sun, because the burial of its ball was symbolic of the setting sun from which new life arises with each dawn. Scarabs of green stones with rims of gold were buried in the heart of the deceased, or laid upon the breast, with a written prayer for his protection on the Day of Judgment, whilst words of power were frequently recited over the Scarab which was placed under the coffin as an emblem of immor- tality so that no fiend could harm the dead in his journey through the under- world.

It was also worn by the Egyptian warriors in their signet rings for Health, Strength, and Virility, it being thought that this species of Beetle was all males, so that it would attract all manly qualities, both of mind and body. For this reason it was very popular as presents between friends, many scarabs being found with good wishes or mottoes engraved on the under side, and some of the kings used the back of scarabs to commemorate historical events ; one in the British Museum records the slaughter of 102 fierce lions by Amenhetep III, with his own hand (see Illustrations Nos. 74, 75, Plate VI). Next to the Scarab, the ancient Egyptians attached much importance to the EYE AMULET, which, from the earliest Astral Mythology, was first represented by the point within the circle and was associated with the god of the Pole Star, which, from its fixity, was taken as a type of the Eternal, unchangeable as time rolled on, and thus a fitting emblem of Fixity"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"EGYPTIAN TALISMANS 69 of Purpose, Poise, and Stability.

NOSTICISM is the name given to a system of religion which came into existence in the Roman Empire about the time Christianity was established ; it was founded on a philosophy known in Asia Minor centuries previously and apparently based upon the Egyptian beliefs, the Zendavesta, Buddhism, and the Kabala, with their conception of the perpetual conflict between good and evil. The name is derived from the Greek Gnosis, meaning knowledge, and, in brief, the Gnostics' belief was that the intellectual world, with its Spirits, Intelligences, and various Orders of Angels were created by the Almighty, and that the visible matter of creation was an emanation from these powers and forces.

The Almighty was known as Abraxas, which signifies in Coptic \" the Blessed Name,\" and was symbolised by a figure, the head of which is that of a Cock, the body that of a man, with serpents forming the legs; in his right hand he holds a whip, and on his left arm is a shield. This Talisman (see Illustrations Nos. 102, 103, Plate VII) is a combination of the five emanations mentioned above : Nous and Logos are expressed by the two serpents, symbols of the inner sense and understanding, the head of the Cock representing Phronesis, for foresight and vigilance ; the two arms hold the symbols of Sophia and Dynamis, the Shield of Wisdom and the Whip of Power, worn for protection from moral and physical ill.

The Etrus- cans, Greeks, and Romans were all familiar with and great believers in the virtues of Talismans and Amulets, a belief based not only on the symbols of their own faith but largely influenced by the beliefs of the surrounding nations, that of the Egyptians being particularly noticeable. Amongst the earliest and most popular Talismans are many Scarab rings with inscriptions cut in the under sides ; these were frequently used as seals. In the course of the amalgamation of beliefs which took place under the Ptolemies, Isis and Osiris were associated with all kinds of Asiatic and Greek gods ; but, as time went on, Isis became"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"8o THE BOOK OF TALISMANS the most universal goddess, ruling heaven and earth and all Mankind, her worship quickly spread- ing throughout all the Roman dominions. Her name is usually understood to mean Wisdom, and upon the pavement of her temple was inscribed, \" I am everything that has been, and is, and shall be, nor hath any mortal opened my veil.\" The most common symbol of Isis was a Cres- cent Moon, which was worn by Roman women upon their shoes as a safeguard from witchcraft and to prevent the evil spirits of the moon from afflicting them with delusions, hysteria, or lunacy ; also to attract the good-will of Isis that they might be successful in love, happy in motherhood, and fortunate in life. From this Crescent symbol (Illus- tration No. 113, Plate VIII) the Horseshoe undoubt- edly became regarded as a Talisman, and as such was used by the Greeks and Romans, who nailed it with the horns upward as a charm against the Plague. In an old publication of 1618 we are instructed that the horseshoe should be nailed upon the threshold to keep Luck within the house and to keep out witches and nullify their evil powers ; but in order to obtain the best results the horseshoe must be found by the owner of the house or by a member of the household.

In Suffolk the fishermen still believe that a horseshoe nailed to the mast of a smack will protect it against bad weather, and their Newfoundland brothers use the horseshoe as a specific against many dangers, especially as a charm to keep away the Devil. In this supersti- tion they resemble the miners of Devon and Corn- wall who fix a horseshoe to the mine with the horns upward, it being common knowledge that the Devil travels in a circle and is consequently frustrated in his evil course when he arrives at either of the horns and is obliged to take a retro- grade course. To this day, it is still regarded by the country-folk as essential to the well-being of the finder of this charm to suspend it horns upward over the door of his dwelling to hold the luck in, it being thought to run out at each end of the horseshoe if reversed.

It is frequently mentioned in the Old and New Testaments, and in 2 Samuel xxii, 3, and Psalm xviii, 2 the Almighty is described as the \" Horn of my Salvation \" ; and St. Luke in the first chapter, 6gih and 7ist verses, writes : \" Hath raised up an horn of Salvation.\" \" That we should be saved from our enemies and from the hands of all that hate us.\" The Horn, being a symbol of Isis, was considered a powerful charm to which to attach the keys of stables and cowsheds, ensuring the safety of the cattle and their protection from the evil spirits of the night, a practice that has been fol- lowed from remote ages to the present day, although its origin is not generally known amongst its modern users.

THE CORNUCOPIA, or Amalthaea's Horn of Plenty, is the symbol of Abundance, Fruitfulness, and Prosperity, and is represented by a horn filled to overflowing with fruits and flowers, as Illustra- tion No. 118, Plate VIII. Amalthaea was the daughter of Melissus (the King of Crete) who nursed the infant Jupiter, feeding him with the milk of a goat. Jupiter afterwards gave the goat's horn to his nurse, endowing it with magical pro- perties, so that whosoever possessed it should immediately obtain in abundance all he desired and find it a veritable \" horn of plenty.\" It is also a symbol of the goddess Fortuna, and was worn as an Amulet to attract good fortune in abundance. With the introduction of Isis came also that of Osiris- Apis with whom the Greeks identified their god of the under-world Hades under the name of Serapis.

To gain favour and protection small images of the Deities were worn as ornaments, such as Diana of Ephesus, Mithras, and especially Harpokrates and Anubis (Illustrations Nos. 104, 107, Plate VIII). HARPOKRATES, the god of eternal youth and fecundity, was typified by the figure of a boy holding his tongue, representing all that is ever fresh and young ; he is the type of the Vernal Sun, bringing fertility to the land, enabling it to pro- duce both food and drink. He is also frequently represented seated on a Lotus, the symbol of the Sun and fecundity. ANUBIS is symbolised as a Jackal-headed god who, in the Egyptian religion, is depicted in the Judgment as weighing the souls of the dead ; he is the Guardian of Souls in the under-world.

The sea-nymphs, jealous of her beauty, chained her to a rock in mid-ocean, that she might be at the mercy of a vile monster of the deep. But the warrior Perseus slew the monster, and married Andromeda. Her image was thought to promote harmony between lovers and peace between man and wife. THE SALUS RING (Illustration No. 112, Plate VIII) was worn by the devotees of Salus, or Hygiea, daughter of ^Esculapius, who was wor- shipped as the goddess of Health. Several holy days were appointed in her honour and worship, and she was publicly invoked for the welfare of the rulers and for the general peace and prosperity of the community ; also for an abundant harvest.

Macrobius says it was the special decor- ation of the victorious general in the triumphant processions, having enclosed within it such reme- dies as were esteemed most efficacious against the evil glance of envy. Introduced into Rome by the Etruscans, it became very popular and was adopted as the badge of free-born boys ; it usually contained an invocation to one or more of the gods.

THE PINE CONE, the symbol of Cybele the goddess of abundant benefits, was worn by her votaries for Health, Wealth, and Power, and all good and necessary things which flow in abundance without ceasing from her influ- ence. She had many names, and was called by the Greeks, Pasithea, signifying Mother, as she was the great mother of all the gods. Her priests were famous for their magical powers, and it was customary to fix her symbol, the Pine Cone, on a pole in the vineyards, to protect them from blight and witchcraft, a practice still to be seen in Italy at the present time, and presumably this was the origin of the Pine Cones which surmount the gateways at the entrances of some of the carriage drives of old country seats (see Illustration No. 117, Plate VIII) ; it also survives as an ornament to the spikes of iron railings enclosing the grounds of old-fashioned houses on the outskirts of many of our provincial towns.

THE SKULL OF AN Ass, set up on a pole in the midst of a cornfield, was considered a potent charm against blight, and in Greece and Rome was placed in vineyards for the same purpose ; it was sacred to Priapus, the god of the gardens, which he was thought to protect from thieves, wild beasts, and mischievous birds. There is a legend that the Ass was held in high estimation, as by gnawing the branches of the vine it taught the art of pruning. THE KEY Talisman was a very important one with both Greeks and Romans.

Diana, or Jana, his wife, presided over doors and thresholds and was the special protectress of childbirth, and as keeper of the Gate of Heaven held the key of light and life. Some of these ancient key Amulets were made in silver (Diana's own metal) and have heart- shaped handles, implying, it is thought by some writers, that the affections must be prudently guarded. The key was also attributed to Hecate Proserpine, who was the guardian of the under- world and could release the spirits of the departed. The key (Illustration No. no, Plate VIII) is shown attached to a finger ring, which was a very popular form of its use.

Plutarch writes that these com- posite objects were fixed up to ward off witch- craft and the evil effects of the first glance of the Evil Eye, it being thought that if the mischief- working eye could be diverted from the object to be protected on to the strange and ridiculous figures represented by the \" GRYLLI \" the glance would be absorbed and its effects destroyed. \" Grylli \" is derived from the modern Italian word \" grille, \" meaning caprice. The Rev. C. W.

It was made up as follows : \" A Ram with a Cornucopia on his head, hold- ing a Rabbit by its tail (signifying fruitfulness and plenty) and a Cock bestride a Dolphin (the Cock being a symbol of the Sun, the Rabbit the Land, and the Dolphin the Sea).

THE ROD was given to Mercury by Apollo, and had the wonderful faculty of deciding all contro- versies and conferring irresistible eloquence on its owner. Its efficacy was proved, when one day whilst travelling Mercury came upon two serpents fighting, and by placing his rod between them and exercising his eloquence, he immediately recon- ciled the combatants. Mutually embracing they became attached to the rod, thus forming the Caduceus. Mercury received his name from his shrewd understanding of merchandise ; he was the inventor of contracts, weights and measures, and of the arts of buying and selling ; for this reason he was regarded as the patron of Merchants and Traders. He invented letters, excelled in eloquence, and was so skilful in making peace, that he is said to have pacified not only men but the immortal gods of Heaven and Hell, whose quarrels he adjusted ; for this reason he was known by the Greeks as Hermes.

With the Romans the Serpent was a household god, and Livy records that, by the advice of the Delphic Oracle, the bringing of a sacred serpent from the temple of yEsculapius to Rome im- mediately stayed the pestilence then raging. The wearing of a ring in the form of a serpent coiled round the finger, signified ari invocation to the God of Health for preservation from sickness. Health rings were much in vogue amongst the Ancient Romans, who frequently presented their friends with such tokens on their birthdays, these anniversaries being considered the most important festivals. A favourite device was an intaglio cut in the ring itself, portraying the head of a youth, and the word \" Vivas \" (Mayst thou live). It was also believed that a Boar's Head engraved upon a ring conferred perpetual health and preservation from danger (the Boar being"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"ETRUSCAN TALISMANS 93 sacred to Demeter) ; whilst a ring engraved with three Ravens was worn for conjugal fidelity. Another device was that of a human head attached to an elephant's trunk, holding a trident (the sym- bol of Neptune), which was worn as a protective charm against peril by sea. Charmed rings have also been much in favour with many nations, the Greeks being very partial to enchanted rings, which were made according to the favourable positions of the planets, their power being strength- ened when the head and neck of the owner was cut in green jasper and set in a ring engraved with the letters B.B.P.P.N.E.N.A., which signified \" Wear this and thou shalt in no wise perish.' 1 Whether hallowed in the name of God or consecrated by the touch of the Pope, or of Royal personages, the ring has ever been the chosen Talisman through which Health, Wealth, and Love was transmitted to its wearer.

At the time of the founding of the Christian religion and onwards through the Middle Ages the symbols used during the services, certain texts, mottoes, and prayers were very popular as Talis- mans. They are often found in combination with symbols used in preceding religions, and were worn for protection from temptation and all kinds of perils, dangers, and diseases. In the earliest days when open avowal of faith meant peril and persecution, these Talismans were of great service in making fellow-believers known to each other, and when Christianity was established were extensively worn, with the approval of Clement of Alexandria. One of the oldest Talismans of this kind is THE FISH, said to have been adopted because its Greek name ixers formed the initials of the sentence \" Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour.\" The form of the Fish is very similar to that used by the Egyptians and is illustrated on Plate IX, No. 120. Another explanation of its use is that in the Talmud the Messiah is often designated by the name \" Dag,\" the Fish, and the sign of His second coming, it is said, would be the conjunc- tion of Saturn and Jupiter in Pisces, which is the origin of the three fishes interlaced into a"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"EARLY CHRISTIAN TALISMANS 103 triangle, a very popular ornament in mediaeval architecture. THE PALM BRANCH was another popular Talis- man used to symbolise triumph over sin and temptation ; this undoubtedly was adapted from the pagan mythology, in which the Palm repre- sented the Sun, and was also a token of victory and success. In Illustration No. 122, Plate IX, it is shown surrounding the Greek name for Fish. Stones were also frequently used, and although valuable gems were in use, semi-precious stones such as the Carnelian, Sardonyx, and Jasper were the most general, the device illustrated on Plate IX, No. 126, being cut in a Sapphire, the usual method of treatment in those days being very seldom to cut in relief, as in more modern times. A favourite gift was a ring with the name of the recipient cut in the stone with some appro- priate motto, as in Illustration No. 124, Plate IX : \" Rogate, Vivas in Deo \" (Rogatus, Live in God). Bronze and silver rings were freely used for this purpose. THE SHIP (Illustration No. 127, Plate IX) was a symbol universally used to represent the Church, and signified the belief of its wearers in their sal- vation and safety from temptations of the flesh.

In consequence he adopted it as the device for the Imperial Standard. It was also commonly used as an abbreviation of the name of Christ. Nos. 126 and 131 are other examples of this symbol, and No. 126 is interesting as being in combination with the Tau Cross, which has been treated fully in a preceding chapter. This Cross when placed upon the top of a heart signified goodness, and was at the same time re- garded as a Talisman for protection from evil. It was the monogram of Thoth, the Egyptian god of Wisdom, and when used with a circle at its base signified the eternal preserver of the world. The Cross with four arms symbolises the four Cardinal Points, or Universe, the dominion of the Spirit.

The Constellation of Aries is situated in the Northern Celestial Hemisphere near the Pleiades, between the Constellations of Pisces and Taurus. In its group it has three very bright stars visible to the naked eye, the brightest of which is known as HAMAL, or the Sheep, and was much more poetically described in the Akkadian tongue as \" Dilkur,\" the dawn proclaimer.

From this time onwards the stone seems to have been endowed with magical and divine powers in arresting hemorrhage from wounds, and was worn by Roman soldiers for this reason ; among the natives of India it is cus- tomary to place the Bloodstone itself upon wounds and injuries after dipping it in cold water. Its curative properties in this respect have been explained in modern times by the fact that the iron oxide in this stone is an active and effective astringent even now used in surgery.

Amongst the ancient Greeks and Romans, the Bloodstone was worn to bring renown and the favour of the great ; to inspire constancy and endurance, and as a charm against the bites of scorpions and all venomous creatures. It was also a great favourite with their athletes, who wore it as a Talisman for success in the games. In an essay written by a certain Thomas Boyle on \" The Origine and Virtues of Gems,\" dated 1675, we read that a gentleman of sanguine habit having been long troubled with excessive bleeding from the nose, was unable to find a cure until \" an ancient gentleman presented him with a Blood- stone the size of a pigeon's egg, to be worn round the neck, and upon the use of this stone he not only cured himself, but stopped hemorrhage in a neighbour.\" Marbodeus Gallus, writing in verse on this stone,"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"140 THE BOOK OF TALISMANS after mentioning its virtue against the Ague and Dropsy, says': \" Againe it is believed to be a safeguard frank and free To such as ware and beare the same ; and if it hallowed bee, It makes the parties gratious and mightier too that have it And noysome fancies as they write who ment not to deprave it It doth dispel out of the mind.

Napoleon, too, attached great value to the qualities of the diamond, and wore the famous REGENT diamond in the hilt of his sword. The history of this remarkable stone is so curious that a brief account of its discovery and subsequent owners may be interesting. It was found at Parteal, south of Golconda, by a slave who con- cealed it by making a gash in the calf of his leg and hiding the stone in the folds of the bandage until he could escape to Madras. Deceived by the promises made to him by a sailor in whom he had confided, he consented, when a purchaser had been found for the stone, to share profits, but was thrown overboard by the seaman, who disposed of the diamond to a dealer named Jamchund for 1000, which he quickly spent, afterwards hanging himself. The stone was next purchased by Thomas Pitt, grandfather to the Earl of Chatham, who pur- chased it after much bargaining for 20,400 ; but the jewel brought him no happiness. So fearful was he of losing it, it is said that he never slept twice at the same house whilst it was in his posses- sion ; also serious reflections were made on his character as to when and under what conditions he had obtained it.

In its natural state it weighed 410 carats, but after its cutting, which took two years to com- plete, it was reduced to 137 carats, and was the size of a large plum, perfectly white, without spot or flaw, and of admirable water. In the disorder attendant on the French Revolution the Regent diamond was stolen from the public treasury. Twelve years afterwards it was recovered, and subsequently was amongst the stones set in the Imperial diadem of France. Another celebrated diamond is the KOH-I-NOOR, or \" Mountain of Light.\" Its history, according to Tavernier, the French traveller, can be traced back to half a century B.C. This stone is reported by Baber, the founder of the Mogul Empire, to have come into the treasury at Delhi from the conquest of Malwa in 1304, since when it has passed through the hands of many Indian rulers, who believed that the safety of their dynasty depended on the possession of this fateful jewel.

His successors, however, would not allow the treasure to be disposed of in this manner, and it was subsequently presented to the late Queen Victoria by Lord Dalhousie on the annexation of the Punjaub, and was brought to London in 1850. The Brahmins believe that the Crimean War and Sepoy Mutiny, which occurred seven years afterwards, were due to its influence, and they say that misfortune will follow the possessor until it is restored to the line of Vikra- maditya ; but we are justified in the hope that as England is under the influence of the Zodiacal House of Aries, the house of the diamond, our Empire may still flourish and prosper.

It is a curious fact that large diamonds have ever brought anxiety and often death to those who have taken them by violence and sold them ; and the strange fatality which, for so many years, seems to have sur- rounded the famous HOPE diamond is an ex- ample. The HOPE DIAMOND was originally owned by Tavernier, the French traveller, already men- tioned. Born in Paris in 1605, he spent some years in the East, traded extensively in precious stones, and accumulated a vast fortune. In the year 1668 the gem, subsequently known as \" the Hope Diamond,\" was sold by Tavernier in a parcel of fine diamonds to Louis XIV, the Grand Monarque. Tavernier was soon after robbed by his son of an immense sum of money ; left destitute, at the age of eighty-one he died in exile. The King's haughty and arrogant favourite, the Duchesse de Montespan, prevailed upon her Royal lover to allow her to wear the dazzling gem at a Court Ball. From that hour she lost her fascination for the fickle monarch, and the circumstances of her fall confirmed the sinister superstition as to the fateful nature of the blue diamond. Most beautiful and most unhappy of all its wearers was Marie An- toinette. She not only wore it herself, but lent it to her dearest friend the Princesse de Lamballe."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"THE HOPE DIAMOND 147 When Madame de Lamballe's head was paraded on a pike by the revolutionary mob, and shown to the King and Queen then practically prisoners and when subsequently the ill-fated Louis XVI perished on the guillotine, and finally was followed by his Queen, who was driven slowly to the scaffold so that she should be made to \" drink long of death,\" the superstitious remembered the reputed curse which the blue diamond was said to bring upon its possessors. For thirty years after this the ill-fated diamond was lost to the public gaze, until it was found in the possession of a lapidary of Amsterdam, whose son stole it from his father and disappeared, Fals, the gem-cutter, dying in absolute want. The son gave the jewel to a Frenchman named Beaulieu, and after disposing of it committed suicide. Frangois Beaulieu brought the gem to London and sold it to a dealer named Daniel Eliason, Beaulieu himself dying the next day mysteriously. Mr. Henry Thomas Hope was the next purchaser, paying Eliason the sum of 18,000 for it. The stone remained in the Hope family until 1901, when Lord Francis Hope (who had married and divorced an actress) sold it to a diamond merchant, who resold it to an American, who, becoming financially embarrassed, disposed of it to M.

A firm of New York jewellers next bought the sinister gem, and although a story was circulated that they had disposed of it to a gentleman who had gone down in the ill-fated Titanic, it is believed to be, at present, in the possession of Mr. McLean, an American millionaire, to whom so far nothing untoward has happened. The preceding paragraph was written in 1914, and in May, 1919, further proof was given of the strange fatality that accompanies this stone in the announcement in all European papers of the death of Vincent Walsh McLean, aged eleven years, who was accidentally killed by a motor-car whilst playing in the road (having escaped from his nurse) near his father's estate.

Undoubtedly the Zodiac had a prehistoric origin, and one of the ancient names given to this sign was TE, meaning foundation, which is interesting from the fact that it was in this sign period that the foundations of the two Jewish temples were laid. As Taurus is the first of the earthly signs it typifies the creative forces of Nature; Apis, the sacred Bull of the Egyptians, was used as its symbol and was adopted by the Greeks as typical of fecundity, and is mentioned in Part I, Chapter VIII, on Greek Talismans.

THE SAPPHIRE. The Sapphire, one of the earliest gems known to man, is found in river- beds and torrents, the force of the water washing the stones from their matrix ; and to this day are still found under these conditions. In its finest quality the sapphire is of a deep blue colour, and the more it resembles the dark velvety blue of the Pansy the greater is its value. Of coloured gems, the Sapphire has been the most venerated amongst all nations, and particu- larly in the East it is the stone most frequently consecrated to the various deities. Amongst Buddhists it is believed to produce a desire for prayer, and is regarded as the Stone of Stones to give Spiritual Light, and to bring Peace and Happiness as long as its wearer leads a moral life. In the early days of the Christian Church, the stones and metal used in making the ring of a Bishop was left very much to the taste of the individual, but in the twelfth century Innocent III decreed that these rings should be made of pure gold, set with an unengraved stone, the Sapphire being the gem selected, as possessing the virtues and qualities essential to its dignified position as"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"THE SAPPHIRE 155 the badge of Pontifical rank and \" a seal of secrets,\" for there be many things \" that a priest conceals from the senses of the vulgar and less intelligent ; which he keeps locked up as it were under seal.\" Of this gem St. Jerome writes that \" it procures favours with princes, pacifies enemies, frees from enchantment, and obtains freedom from cap- tivity.\" The Jews also held this stone in high veneration, the seal-stone in the ring of King Solomon being said to be a Sapphire, and in Exodus xxiv. 10, we read in the description of a manifestation of Jehovah : \" There was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness.\" This description of clearness, if taken as mean- ing transparency, would indicate a familiarity with the qualities of the stone as we know it, although in most of the ancient writings all blue stones are loosely described as Sapphires, including the Tables of the Law, which it is practically certain could not have been of Sapphire and in all probability were of Lapis Lazuli.

It also gave concentra- tion ; but if worn by an intemperate or impious person, it lost its lustre, thus indicating the presence of vice and impurity. It is recorded that in the Church of Old St. Paul's, London, there was a famous Sapphire given by \" Richard de Preston, Citizen and Grocer of that city, for the cure of infirmities in the eyes of those thus afflicted who might resort to it.\" Cloudy Sapphires are sometimes found which owing to a peculiarity in their composition show six rays of light running from the top of the stone. These are known as Asteria, or Star Stones, and this Star Sapphire was much valued by the Ancients as a love charm ; they considered it peculiarly powerful for the procuring of favours, for bringing good fortune and averting witchcraft. Six is the number given to Venus, and is also the number of the true Solomon's Seal, whose virtues and qualities (treated of under Talismans, Part I, Chapter II) this stone represents.

The confessor kept the Talisman and was raised to high honours by Charlemagne, becoming Archbishop of Mainz and Chancellor of the Empire. It was, however, restored to the monarch on his death-bed when he was suffering great agony, and it enabled him to pass peace- fully away. THE TURQUOISE. The Turquoise is universally recognised as a Venus stone, though sometimes erroneously attributed to the Zodiacal House of Capricorn, which is ruled by the planet Saturn. It responds to the vibrations of both Venus Houses, but seems strongest in Taurus. This stone was, in ancient times, known as the Turkis, or Turkeystone, as most of the specimens found in Europe in those days came from Persia through the hands of Constantinople merchants.

The Turquoise is more frequently used for Amulets than any other stone, as much for its mystic virtues as for its beauty, particularly in the East, where sentences from the Koran are engraved upon it and the characters gilded. Amongst its many virtues it was believed to warn of poison by becoming moist and changing colour ; and it is said that King John, by these indications, detected the poison that caused his death. This gem has always been regarded as a pledge of true affections, and is also credited with the power of drawing upon itself the evil that threatens its wearer ; but this quality belongs only to the Turquoise that has been given, and not pur- chased. Bcetius de Boot tells of a stone that had been in the possession of a Spanish gentleman living near his father ; the stone was of exceptional beauty, but at the time of its owner's death it had entirely lost its colour and was said to resemble Malachite more than Turquoise. Because of this de Boot's father bought it for a very small sum, but not liking to wear so shabby-looking a gem, he gave it to his son, saying, \" Son, as the virtues of the Turkois are said to exist only when the stone"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"THE TURQUOISE 159 has been received as a gift, I will try its efficacy by bestowing it upon thee.\" De Boot, although he did not much appreciate the gift, had his crest engraved upon it, but had not worn it a month before it regained its original beauty. Shortly after this the stone gave evidence of its power, for as de Boot was riding home in the dark his horse stumbled and fell from a bank to the road ten feet below, neither horse nor rider being any the worse for the fall ; in the morning the stone was found to be split in two. It is for qualities such as these that it is prized by the Turks as a horseman's Talisman, they believing that it makes a horse sure-footed and protects its rider from injury by falls ; and Camillus Leonardus says : \" So long as a rider hath the Turquoise with him his horse will never tire him and will preserve him from any accident, and defend him that carries it from untoward and evil casualties.\" In the Middle Ages the Turquoise was believed to appease hatred, relieve and prevent headaches, and to change colour when its owner was in peril or ill-health.

Gemini is also symbolised by two Pillars joined at the top and base (II), which is a diagrammatic representation of the Twins seated side by side with embracing arms.

From these circumstances they were regarded as protectors of navigation, it being inferred that whenever both stars were visible it was a harbinger of fine weather, the appearance of one star only signifying storms and tempests. It may be noted that as a rule the seas are calm when the Sun is in Gemini, and it was at this period of the year that the forty days' rain of the Deluge ceased. The symbol of the two Pillars joined at the top and base, already referred to, were also believed to typify the two pillars set up by King Solomon in the porch of the Temple, which were quite distinct and apart from the building itself and were not for any structural purpose, their use being entirely symbolical.

Ovid in his Fasti tells us that \" Neither are the times suitable for the mar- riage of the widow nor the virgin. She who was married was not so for long. Also for this cause (if proverbs affect you) they commonly say evil things for marrying in the month of Mai.\" This last sentence (in its original Latin) was affixed to the gates of Holyrood Palace after the wedding of Mary Queen of Scots to Bothwell on the I5th of May, 1567. Another old writer says that the day of the week on which the I4th of May falls is not only unlucky for marriage in this unfor- tunate month, but that throughout the remainder of the year that particular day will bring ill-luck to those who marry on it ; and another old proverb runs : \" May never was ye month of love.\" Even now it is stated fewer marriages take place in this month than in any other.

Joseph gave five suits of raiment to Benjamin, and presented only five of his brothers to Pharaoh. David took five pebbles when he went to fight Goliath, and Joshua hanged five kings on five trees ; further, every important measurement of the Tabernacle was five or a multiple of five ; also there were five wise and five foolish virgins. In the Mohammedan religion there are five articles of belief, namely in Allah, in the Prophets, in Angels, the Day of Judgment, and Predestina- tion. In Astrology there are five principal aspects of the planets which rule the good, or bad fortunes of the subject ; also in Masonry the grand scheme is five points of fellowship, also five brethren can hold a fellow-craft's lodge.

Owing to the antagonism be- tween their feelings and their reason, they are seldom able to concentrate on any one thing for any length of time, thus they start many schemes and enterprises which they abandon before completion. In consequence, Intuition and its forces, (as opposed to Impulse and individual inclination,) strain and perplex the versatile mind of this type, making them capricious and irritable, although their anger is easily appeased. They are highly strung, vivacious, restless, and fond of change and variety in their friends and asso- ciates, having great dislike to monotonous work and ever seeking fresh outlets for their effer- vescence.

In marriage and business relations those born during the Gemini period will agree best with Aries, Leo, Libra, and Aquarius characters, and it is a curious fact that in the lives of those born whilst the Sun occupies the House of the Twins, nearly all important events, fortunate or unfortunate, happen twice, and incidents in the career are repeated in a similar way."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"168 THE BOOK OF TALISMANS The fortunate stones of this House are all varieties of Agates and the Chrysoprase. THE AGATE. The Agate is a variety of quartz found in different colours, often with alternate layers of red and white known as \" ribbon \" Agate, also of a milky white. The latter can be artificially coloured and, in consequence, is ob- tainable in bright greens and blues as well as in various tones of greyish purple. The Moss or Tree Agate is a variety ornamented by Nature in a most remarkable manner with lines, spots, and frequently with natural objects taking the distinct forms of ferns, trees, clouds, and moss, giving a very mysterious effect to the stone. In the days of the Romans this variety was held in high repute as possessing both medicinal and talismanic virtues, it being claimed that the wonderful markings formed in this stone indicated that it had been specially singled out by the Creator to receive wondrous occult power. According to Orpheus, \" If thou wear a piece of Tree Agate upon thine hand the Immortal Gods shall be well pleased with thee ; if the same be tied to the harness of thy oxen when ploughing, or about the ploughman's sturdy arm, wheat-crowned Ceres shall descend from heaven with full lap upon thy furrows.\" The Moss Agate was also considered good for"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"THE AGATE 169 the sight and was used by physicians for palettes on which they ground down the ingredients used in making up lotions and ointments. The vegetable representations in the Tree Agates are supposed to have been produced by particles of metallic substances, such as iron and magnesium ; the name Mocha Stone, sometimes used to indicate this variety, is derived from Mocha in Arabia, where it was found. In the British Museum there is a striking speci- men of Moss Agate representing a likeness of the poet Chaucer ; and the Strawberry Hill Collec- tion has another with a portrait of Voltaire, and a third showing the profile of a woman. There are also numerous varieties of Agate dependent upon the arrangement of the layers ; sometimes the stone shows parallel lines of light and dark tints, when it is called banded or ribbon Agate. When the colours are very sharp and defined it becomes Onyx Agate, and when the stripes converge towards the centre of the stone it is known as Eye Agate; whilst another variety showing many colours becomes Rainbow or Iris Agate. According to Mr. Streeter, Agates in their natural state are formed in the cavities of rocks, and it is conjectured that when the rocks were in a fluid state the Agates were formed by the escape"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"170 THE BOOK OF TALISMANS of gas or steam. These cavities were afterwards filled with some mineral substance, such as silica, held in solution and deposited on the interior walls of these receptacles, forming a kind of geode. In addition to the Moss or Tree Agate, the Greeks and Romans had great faith in the talis- manic and medicinal virtues of all other Agates, wearing them to avert sickness, regarding them particularly as an antidote to the bite of an Asp, if taken powdered in wine, or as an infallible cure for the sting of a Scorpion if tied over the wound. They also brought success in love and friendship, great gain, and the favours of the great, if strung on a hair taken from a lion's mane. Pliny was a great believer in the virtues of the Agate, and writes that storms may be averted by burning these stones ; whilst Camillo Leonardo, in addition to their power to avert lightning and tempest, says they bring strength, vigour, and great success to their wearers. Marbodus, Bishop of Rennes, ascribes the escape of ^Eneas from all his perils to the virtue of an Agate Talis- man which he always carried with him.

Amongst Mohammedans it was believed to cure insanity if taken powdered in apple juice. In Elizabethan days our forefathers had great faith in its talismanic virtues, the Queen having amongst her jewels a large oval Agate engraved with scenes representing Vulcan at his forge with Venus look- ing on. This jewel was presented to her by Arch- bishop Parker, and was accompanied by a parch- ment giving in Latin a long list of its properties, concluding to the effect that as long as Her Majesty possessed this jewel she would ever have a trusty friend. Agates of all kinds were much esteemed by the Greeks, particularly those specimens in which could be traced resemblances to natural objects.

The Chrysoprase, like the Agate, is a variety of quartz and takes its name from two Greek words meaning \" golden leek,\" in reference to its colour, which varies from an opaque yellowish green to a very light dirty white- green. The colour has a tendency to fade from long exposure to the light and sun, but can be restored if the stone is dipped in a solution of nitrate of nickel. The finest specimens come from Silesia, and when the stone was in demand it used to be cus- tomary to close the mines for every two years out of three. According to Albertus Magnus, a Chrysoprase formed the Amulet of Alexander the Great, and Chrysoprase was much used by the ancient Greeks and Romans for signet rings and cameos ; and also by the Egyptians, who set it with lapis lazuli. The virtues attributed to the Chrysoprase were that it imparted cheerfulness, making the heart glad by removing uneasiness, protecting its wearers from evil dreams and the assaults of demons.

The origin of the word Emerald is from a Sans- krit word meaning green, it being thought that there was nothing in Nature to equal its colour and brilliancy, and it was an old Hebrew belief that if a serpent fixed its eye upon the lustre of this stone it would become blind. The cause of its beautiful green tint has been attributed by some scientists to the presence of oxide of chromium, by others to copper, whilst in 1848 an experimenter believed it to be derived from an organic matter called chlorophyl, similar to the colouring substance of the leaves of plants.

PEARLS. Amongst all nations Pearls have ever been considered the most beautiful products of Nature, but having their origin in a living organism cannot be called a precious stone.

It has always been greatly valued in India, where it is regarded not only as a bringer of wealth, but a Talisman to prevent its owner's gain diminishing.

The Sardonyx is a rich red- brown stone, the top part of which is formed of a layer of white Chalcedony, or Sard, through which the lower part of the stone shows as a pale flesh colour ; when found without the Sard the stone becomes the Cornelian. The Sard derives its name from a Greek word meaning flesh, and is the Sardius of the Ancients. The finest Sardonyx come from India and Arabia, but it is also found in Germany and the Tyrol. It is especially good for engraving upon, having a hard smooth surface capable of taking a high polish, and in ancient cameos the under- stone is generally used to form the ground, the lighter top layer being carved into figures, the different depths of the carving affording variety to the effect. These qualities made it a favourite with the Romans, who believed that the virtue of stones could be increased if suitably engraved, so that the Sardonyx was frequently carved with a"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"SARDONYX AND CHRYSOLITE 193 figure representing Mars or Hercules to render its wearer fearless and courageous.

Also, Camillus Leonardus says, it puts restraint upon those inclined to dissipation and makes a man agreeable as a companion. THE CHRYSOLITE. The Chrysolite is a very beautiful yellow-green gem which derives its name from two Greek words meaning \" golden stone,\" by which name it is referred to by Pliny. It varies in colour, and although exactly the same stone it bears different names ; when of a deep bright green, it is known as Peridot, and when of an olive-green it is called the Olivine. It is one of the softest of the hard stones, being easily scratched by quartz. The stones are found in Egypt, Ceylon, and Brazil, and specimens have been found in meteorites and the lava of Vesuvius.

During the Middle Ages these stones were worn for foresight with regard to future events, and for Divine inspiration and eloquence. THE TOURMALINE. The Tourmaline is of com- paratively modern origin in Europe as far as its use as a precious stone is concerned. It is very remarkable because of its electrical qualities, for when heated one end will become positive and attract straws or ashes, whilst the other end will be negative and non-attractive. It is transparent in one direction, but if looked at from another it may be found quite opaque. It is found in India, Siberia, Brazil, and America, and of all colours and shadings of red, pink, yellow, green, and white ; two colours may also exist on the same crystal, which may be green at one end and red at the other.

AMBER. Amber has from the most remote ages been familiar to humanity, ornaments in this material having come down to us, shaped by men of the Stone Age, thus proving its antiquity. Many fanciful theories were given in bygone days with regard to its origin, amongst others the his- torian Nicias stating that the heat of the Sun was so great in some regions as to set up intense per- spiration in the earth, from which Amber resulted ; whilst among the Greeks a legend existed that it originated in the tears of the sisters of Phaethon, who, in their sorrow at his death, were turned into poplar trees, and whose perpetual tears congealed into Amber. Pliny asserted it to be the overflow- ing sap of certain trees, hence the name Succinum, from a word signifying \" juice \" ; and modern research confirms this idea of a vegetable origin, for Amber is now known to be the fossil resin of an extinct species of pine of the Tertiary Period. Amber is found in large quantities on the coast of the Baltic, washed up after storms, and the German Government exercises a strict monopoly over the trade. It is also found round the coasts of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and parts of Asia and the United States ; and in Essex, Suffolk, and Norfolk.

That it was once in a liquid state is shown by the insects and plants sometimes found in it, a good many of the insects belonging to species that no longer exist.

Great quantities were introduced into Rome during the reign of the Emperor Nero, who in verse described the hair of his wife as amber- coloured, causing much emulation amongst the ladies of his court in their endeavours to secure the fashionable colour. The name Amuletum was given to Amber as well as to the flower Cyclamen (see Chapter I, Part I), both having the power to protect from poisonous drugs, necklaces being worn specially by children for this purpose, and also as a counter-charm against witchcraft and sorcery. Its range of medicinal virtues is very extensive, Callistratus asserting it to be of great service at any period of life against insanity, either taken as a powder, or worn round the neck ; the golden- yellow variety known as the Chryselutum being specially used to ward off ague.

Its popularity as mouth-pieces to pipes, cigar- and cigarette-holders arose from a belief in the East that Amber will not transmit infection. It has ever been in vogue throughout China, Japan, India, and the East, and retains its favour to the present day.

She is said to have invented the arts of husbandry (previous to which humanity existed on a diet of acorns,) and for her services was crowned with wheat.

Corroboration of this can be seen at the present day in Notre Dame Cathedral, where, amongst the twelve signs of the Zodiac engraved on the outside when entering from the North, the sixth sign has been represented by a figure of the Virgin elevated above all the rest. The birth of the Virgin Mary is said to have taken place when the Sun was in the sixth sign, and characteristics attributed to her correspond in many instances to those of the Virgo type. This House has been found to be well suited to be the significator of virgins, because as a rule those born under the influence of this sign are cool, patient, and self-respecting, and do not usually fall into error through unrestrained affec- tions ; whilst Mercury is the ruling planet of this House as well as that of Gemini, both signs being"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"202 THE BOOK OF TALISMANS typical of youth and purity as represented by the Twin Children and the Maiden.

In the same way, if there is a detrimental aspect from a malefic planet, it will accentuate the misfortune and disappointments indicated. The effect of these complex blends of influence is very far-reaching, so that it is impossible to judge accurately of this type without seeing the indi- vidual horoscope, although many of their general characteristics can be recognised in the following brief outline of the Sun's influence on those born during the time of his passing through Virgo.

In whatever direction the activities of this type may be carried on they will ever seek mental freedom, so that although they may pursue one idea or habit for some time, they are always liable to make sudden changes and completely alter their former views, often with undesirable results, but always with apparent reason to themselves. There is also a lack of responsiveness to enthu- siasm or plans formed by their family and friends which is very damping in its effect on those born under fiery signs.

Cornelians are a variety of Chalcedony, and are found of a bright red, yellow, and white colour, in varying tones, and frequently with two or all the colours combined in one stone. On exposure to the Sun the colour becomes brighter and deeper, although artificial light and heat fail to produce the same effect.

In Arabia and throughout Turkey Cornelians are considered to be the best of all stones for talismanic purposes, and it is a curious fact that in certain districts of Europe under Turkish rule, it was common for Moslems to take their stones to the Christian priest whose blessing was considered to add greatly to their efficacy. The deep red stones were the ones most prized, and they were frequently to be seen engraved with verses from the Koran ; of these, there are several examples in the British Museum in the galleries devoted to comparative religions.

Marbodus, writing in the eleventh century, declares that if worn on the neck or finger it has a soothing effect, cooling the blood and \" stilling angry passions,\" preserving concord and driving away evil thoughts ; whilst Camillus Leonardus adds to its virtues the powers of preservation from lightning and tempest, from vice and enchantment, blood-posioning and fever, and that it was good for the staunching of bleed- ing.

Mexican Opals are more transparent, with the colouring less definite, and arranged in much larger patches ; from Mexico we also get fire Opals which are of one colour, the deep red \" fire-like \" stones being the best, though they vary in colour to a warm yellow. Opals are very soft when first taken from the mine, but harden by exposure. Great care is necessary in cutting and also in setting them, as they are very brittle and liable to chip. In the fourteenth century the Opal was known as the Ophthalmius, or Eye Stone, because it was believed to sharpen and strengthen the eye- sight ; also that its flashes of coloured fire were especially efficacious in arresting the glance of envy. In India, the passing of an Opal across the brow is believed to clear the brain and strengthen the memory."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"THE OPAL 219 The idea of its being an unlucky stone had its origin in the misfortunes that befell Anne of Geierstein in Sir Walter Scott's novel, her principal jewel consisting of a large Opal ; they are not, in reality, more unlucky than other stones, though being a Libra gem and essentially a pledge of friendship, they are not fortunate for any one having Venus afflicted in their horoscope. In the East it is regarded as a sacred stone which contains the Spirit of Truth, and in Ancient Greece the Opal was supposed to possess the power of giving foresight and the light of prophecy to its owner, provided it was not used for selfish ends ; its misuse bringing ill-luck in love (which probably accounts for its being unlucky when used in an engagement ring) and disappointment and misfortune in all enterprises. Pliny tells, as an illustration of its high value, that Nonnius, a Roman Senator, endured out- lawry and exile at the hands of Marcus Antonius rather than part with an Opal he possessed. All Opals are very sensitive to atmospheric conditions, varying in brilliancy according to the temperature, their colouring being at its best when worn and kept warm and dry. This sensitive- ness was believed by the ancients to make them susceptible to influences of an occult nature, so that when the colour of an Opal was bright and"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"220 THE BOOK OF TALISMANS lively it indicated success and good fortune to enterprises or travel, and when dull and lifeless it warned of failure and disappointments.

CORAL. Coral has been classed amongst gems from time immemorial by all nations, although, as is well known, it is the product of a marine insect. It is found in various colours, the pink, red, and white, however, being the only kinds generally used as gems. It is produced in enormous quantities in the Southern Seas, where it forms huge reefs and even islands ; but practically the whole of the Coral used for ornamental purposes is obtained in the Mediterranean off the African coasts, the Greeks maintaining an extensive fleet solely engaged in this trade. It is exported in very large quantities to China, Japan, India, and Persia, where it is used not only for its talismanic virtues, but also for its medicinal qualities.

The Coral rattle of bells used in modern nurseries is a survival from this period when Coral was worn for health purposes, and the bells to drive away evil spirits. They also used powdered Coral, taking it internally in water for pains in the stomach ; and, after burning the powder, used it as an important ingredient in ointments for ulcers and sore eyes because of its soothing and healing qualities. The Roman ladies wore small branches of Coral suspended from the neck as charms against sterility. In India, China, and Japan, it is extensively used in Rosaries, and is very popular, being regarded as a sovereign remedy against cholera and all epidemics, and invaluable in indicating to its wearer the presence of poison, or the danger of illness, by changing colour.

Lapis Lazuli is a deep blue stone well known to all ancient nations, and is most probably the stone mentioned in early writings as the Sapphire, the Tables of the Law stated in the Bible as being of the latter, although there is not much doubt that Lapis Lazuli is the stone meant. It is an opaque stone, and is frequently flecked with gold owing to the presence of iron pyrites in its composition. The best qualities come from China, Persia, and Siberia ; whilst the lighter - coloured and less valuable is found in Germany and South America. Its name is derived from Lapis, meaning \" a stone,\" and the Arabic word Azul, meaning \" blue.\" It was very popular with the Egyptians, several of their Talismans being made of this gem, par- ticularly the Eye and Heart, specimens of which may be seen in the fourth Egyptian Room at the British Museum.

As the Serpent, it typifies the temptation of Eve, who won wisdom and knowledge at the price of bitter sorrow and suffering. According to Greek Myth- ology the Scorpion was placed in the heavens by Juno the Queen of Gods (and wife of Jupiter), because it carried out her wishes by stinging Orion, who had offended the goddess by boasting that he could outrun and subdue the wildest and fiercest of beasts. Orion died from the effects of the sting and, with the Scorpion, was translated to the heavens, forming different constellations so placed that as one sets the other rises ; and amongst mariners, when Orion is obscured it is considered to indicate storm and tempest, or when he is visible, fair weather.

Although apparently matter-of-fact they are more or less psychic according to the stage of their development, but often fail to realise this power, attribut- ing their experiences in this direction to keen per- ception and quick and accurate deduction, for they always discredit all they cannot personally feel or understand, looking upon the limits of their understanding as the limit of nature. One of their strongest traits of character is their wonderful power of resistance, for even when the chances of success are nil they are never discouraged, rising again and again after reverses seemingly unaware of defeat, also rarely showing emotion or feeling by any change of expression.

The Beryl and Aquamarine are practically the same stone, differing only in colour, the Beryl varying from a bright blue to white, and the Aquamarine, as its name implies, coinciding with Pliny's description of \" the gem green as the sea \" ; like the sea its colour varies from a pale cool green to a deep green. In quite recent years it has become common amongst jewellers and dealers in precious stones to describe all kinds generally as Aquamarines, and therefore it is not unusual to find one merchant describing the green stone as the Beryl, whilst his neighbour gives this name to the blue. In their compositions these stones are almost exactly the same as the Emerald, and are found in India, Siberia, and Brazil.

It is found in India, Ceylon, Brazil, and the Cape, and has been described by mediaeval writers (including Chaucer and Mandeville) as giving forth light in darkness, whilst in old legends a large Carbuncle is said to have served Noah as a lamp. Shakespeare also refers to the light that comes from this stone, and these descriptions may have arisen from the fact that many very sensitive or psychic people are able to see a certain luminous effect surrounding the gem. It was a very popular stone with the Ancient Hebrews, who knew it as Baraketh, or flashing stone, which is derived from Barak, meaning lightning. Camillus Leonardus recommends it as a safeguard from poison, and in infectious illnesses, for repressing extravagance, and for mightily increasing the popularity and pros- perity of its wearer.

The Lodestone is composed of proto-oxide and peroxide of iron, and from its magnetic qualities is known as Magnetite.

Claudius, a Roman poet who lived some 600 years later, mentions a statue of Venus made of Lodestone and one of Mars in Iron, placed in the same temple that they might be attracted together at the marriage ceremonies, the Romans believing that this stone kept husband and wife faithful and their love secure.

Capricorn is an earthy sign, and its subjects are apt to exaggerate the importance of earthly life, and in youth suffer much furtive and fearful curiosity, regarding the mysteries of birth and death, and, as children, feel deeply any snub or reproof, and should never be brought up by coarse-minded people, as they readily take on the conditions of those around them, and although appreciative of commendation lose heart when indifferently treated."},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"248 THE BOOK OF TALISMANS This sign is typical of a remarkable continuity of purpose, and those born under its influence are deep thinkers and insatiable in their desire for knowledge, assiduous students, quick to seize and take advantage of any opportunity for self-im- provement or advancement, indefatigable workers, and capable of planning out several schemes and thoughts at the same time. The desire to make money is a marked character- istic, not so much for its own sake in the majority of cases as for the power and opportunities which wealth brings ; but although thrifty and discreet in financial affairs generally it is difficult for them to economise in personal matters, and although they work harder and know better than most how to make both ends meet, yet the proverbial rainy day occasionally finds them unprepared. They are generous by fits and starts, giving ungrudgingly of time as well as money where others bestow little, and nothing where others give much, and, in contrast to the Sagittarian type who give mostly to large institutions, the subjects of Capricorn prefer helping the individual.

When the ruling planet Saturn is badly aspected by Mars, revolutionary tendencies and a cruel enjoyment of the sufferings of others is indi- cated ; but so great is the love of work even amongst the most primitive of these subjects of Capricorn, that they are too much engaged to have time to be vicious, and when the malefic side of the Satur- nian's qualities are very noticeable, it is often the result of too much solitude wherein the subject has brooded over troubles and anxieties.

In China and Japan it is also worn to confer long life, health, and happiness. Pliny describes it as the Lychnis, and says the Star Rubies were considered by the Chaldeans to be most powerful in protecting from evil and attracting the favour of those in authority. Throughout the whole of the Orient the Ruby was believed to possess the power of foretelling danger by a loss of brilliancy and colour, a belief also common throughout Europe as confirmed by Wolfgangus Gabelschoverus, who writing in the year 1600, says, whilst travelling with his wife : \" I observed by the way that a very fine Ruby (which she had given me) lost repeatedly and each time almost completely its splendid colour and assumed a blackish hue.\" He goes on to tell that the threatened evil was fulfilled by the loss of his wife, and that after her death the stone regained its colour and brilliancy.

It was worn by the subjects of this House whose horoscopes were free from Saturn's afflictions to protect the body from plague, poison, and fevers, and to secure love and friendship, preserve health, vitality, and cheerfulness, against disorders of the liver and spleen, and to drive away evil dreams and spirits. It was also believed to be a very active and sensitive stone, and if the horoscope had Saturn badly afflicted would afford a ready channel for disappointment, bereavement, and other misfortunes incidental to the influence of this planet when malefic.

Pearce in his text -book of Astrology mentions \"that workers in copper mines have escaped cholera when their neighbours died of it, also that copper is worn by the Hindus as a Charm against cholera.\" Marbodus recommends the Malachite as a Talis- man for young people because of its protective qualities and power in attracting sound sleep ; it was also worn for protection from lightning and contagious diseases and for health, success, and constancy in the affections. During the Middle Ages it was customary to wear it engraved with a figure or symbol of the Sun as a preservative to the health and to avert despondency and depres- sion of spirits to which the Capricorn type are liable.

An interpretation which, at least, is in harmony with its qualities, is that Aquarius, being one of the airy triplicities and the period of its occupation by the Sun being a moist one (familiarly known to us as February Fill-dyke), the vapours and clouds borne on its air are appropriately symbolised by the figure of a water-bearer, and the two waved lines crrrr the most ancient pictorial illustration of water which form the Glyph of this House equally well expressed its qualities."},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"HOUSE OF THE WATER-BEARER 259 Ancient writers assign Saturn to be the ruler of this House as well as of Capricorn, and he is doubtless very strong when in occupation, but the consensus of opinion amongst modern as- trologers is to replace Saturn by the planet Uranus as the ruler of this sign, appearing as he does to affect this House more than any other during his periodic stay of seven years.

Dealers in gems are amongst the shrewdest of mankind, and from continually handling and examining stones become wonderfully keen in judging them from their appearance and feel, and are very seldom mistaken in distinguishing the real from the imitation, and no novice will get the better of them in a deal, so that intending pur- chasers who have no practical experience of gems are advised to buy from established firms with a 376"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"REAL AND ARTIFICIAL GEMS 277 reputation to lose, or on the advice of an expert, rather than rely upon their own judgment. Before the full beauty of a stone can be appre- ciated it has to be cut and polished, either with facets, or in the form known as cabochon. Prac- tically all transparent stones are cut with facets, the best and most popular form being the \" bril- liant \" cut (as shown in Illustration No. I of the Frontispiece) which has been found so effective with diamonds that the term \" brilliant \" has become the recognised name for a diamond cut in this manner. With oblong stones \" trap \" cutting is followed, Emeralds being the principal stones cut in this fashion (as shown in No. 4 of Frontispiece). \" Rose \" cutting is the form generally adopted with very small diamonds nowadays, although it is a much older form than the brilliant, and large antique stones are to be found cut in this fashion, culminating in a point formed by six triangular facets in place of the table of the bril- liant. Semi-transparent and opaque stones, such as Moonstones, Opals, Agates, Turquoises, and Cornelians are usually cut en cabochon (as shown in the stones illustrated in Nos. 3, 6, and 7 of the Frontispiece), and Amethysts, Rubies, Emeralds, and Sapphires are also frequently cut in this fashion."},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"278 THE BOOK OF TALISMANS For years past scientists have been experiment- ing in the manufacture of precious stones, and with so much success that reconstructed stones have been put on the market and are now fairly universally used. These stones are made up from fragments of small genuine stones which are fused together by a continuous and very powerful flame directed on the mass whilst it is kept in motion, resulting in a solid lump that can be cut and polished in the same way as the natural mineral. This has been very successfully done with Rubies, some having been produced which passed every test save that of the microscope, which revealed numerous minute bubbles of a rounded shape invisible to the naked eye, and in greater quantities than would be found in the natural stones wherein the bubbles are more rectangular in shape. These Rubies, and also reconstructed Sapphires and Emeralds, are on sale everywhere at the present time, so that intending buyers of precious stones should ask their jewellers to guarantee that they are buying natural and not reconstructed stones. All transparent gems may be roughly divided into two classes, singly and doubly refracting, a ray of light passing through being refracted or thrown back according to the nature of the stone.

Stones that are doubly refractive are Ruby, Beryl, Topaz, Sap- phire, Emerald, Tourmaline, Peridot, Chrysolite, Aquamarine, Amethyst, Jargoon, Zircon, and Crystal Singly refracting stones are Diamonds, Spinels, and Garnets ; glass also is singly re- fracting. One of the simplest and most effective methods of testing the genuineness of a gem is to try if it is affected by filing with a small jeweller's file ; care must be taken, however, in its use, as the facets of even some of the hardest stones are easily chipped. If the file scratches the stone it may be taken to be glass, or composition. Combination stones, known as \" Doublets,\" are frequently sold as genuine stones ; in these the top part is made of the real stone and the lower part of crystal, glass, or composition, so that for their detection the bottom part as well as the top must be tried with the file. ' ' Triplets ' ' are another form of deception. In this case the tops and bottoms of the stones are genuine and the centre part is imitation.

White Sapphires, Jargoons, and Aquamarines are sometimes mistaken for diamonds ; but the White Sapphire will frequently have a suggestion of cloudiness, and the Jargoon or Zircon, though very hard, is brittle and chips easily, soon showing signs of wear. White Aquamarines usually have a slight bluish or greenish tint. White Topazes and Rock Crystal are not so brilliant and full of life as the other white stones, and all these are doubly refracting, whilst the Diamond is single. Imitation Sapphires are as a rule harsher in colour than the real stone, which is soft and rich in the quality of its colour. Pearls are imitated with great skill, and are difficult to detect. They are usually lighter than the real Pearls, and if drilled the holes are seldom as small, and show marks of chipping and breaking round the edges. Pearls lose their lustre and de- teriorate with age and the effect of gas and acids, and should be carefully wiped with a clean cloth after being worn, and in order to retain their brilliancy should be kept in dry magnesia.
