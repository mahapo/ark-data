For the most part, it can be performed without complicated rituals, needs ha rdly any paraphernalia, is independent of philosophical and dogmatic premises and, due to its simplicity, can be learned easily and quickly. Most important of all, none of the magical techniques we know of today is more efficient and will give even beginners the immediate chance to convince themselves of its power and their own abilities. These reasons alone support a volume like the following to show the possibilities of this discipline and to explain its techniques and its rationale. The reader—the complete tyro and the advanced practitioner alike—will receive an introduction which will accom pany him/her in his/her magical practice for a long time to come. You will find in this edition in the following chapter a reprint of my artic le “Austin Osman Spare and His Theory of Sigils'' from the, alas, now—defunct German magazine Unicorn, issue 1/82. This issue has been out of print for quite some time, but many readers' inquiries have shown that ther e is still much interest in this article and it is increasi ng every day. Since the article also covers some of the historical and philosophical background of Spare's sigil magic, it might be useful to present it here within a new co ntext to a greater audience. ix"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"x / Practical Sigil Magic The word method explained in the article will be shown in greater depth in chapter 2. Further examples will be given, as well as comments and tips for practical use which you will rarely find in literature on this subject. Next we will deal with the pictorial method , which has several advantages and disadvantages when compared to the word method. Again, in accordance with the title of this volume, magical practice will be of primary importance. A description of the mantrical spell method will complete the techniques of sigil construction proper. It is my hope that examples and commentaries from my personal practice will provi de you with many new suggestions. Although Spare's mysterious Alphabet of Desire belongs, technically speaking, to the pictorial method and in some respects touches the word method, it may nevertheless be considered the center of his magical achievement. Unfortunately, his own comments about it are rather poor. Therefore, most writers, being familiar with the subject on a theoreti cal level only, have caused much confusion rather than clarity when discussing it. Yet, it seems to me that the ba sic principle of this magical symbol language is amazingly simple if viewed in relation to Spare's system as a whole. The chapter “The Alphabet of Desire,'' theref ore, will not only offer a cursory comment on fragments from Spare's rather chaotic legacy but introduce a mature system of symbol—logic, accessible to everyone.

Albeit Spare's personal philosophy (which he himself termed the Zos Kia Cultus ) is not that important for sigil magic itself, we sh ould not fail to mention his technique of Atavistic nostalgia , which is certainly one of the most fascinating applications of sigil magic. Furthermore, it marks its connection to Shamanism and so—called “primitive magic,'' two disciplines from which today's magicians can only profit. The main topic of the la st chapter will concern planetary sigils from the Hermetic Tradition. Although experts have been familiar with the method of their construction for decades, little or no relevant literature has as yet been made ava ilable to a wider public. It, therefore, seemed pertinent to treat this subject matter here. The reader will note th at in this volume we concentrate on creating personal , that is to say, individual sigils. This is a completely different approach compared to the tendency of many other books, which usually prefer to list traditional, la rgely mutilated or inaccurately reproduced sigils taken from the “magical cookbooks'' of generally obscure authors with little or no practical experience of their own. Although the planetary sigils"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Xii / Practical Sigil Magic discussed at the end of this study are taken from the work of Agrippa Nettesheim, who is above all criticism in this respect, a single glance at other standard works about magical symbols will show that most magicians and alchemists in the Middle Ages (the supposed “peak” of Occidental magic) largely developed their own sigil language using a rather small number of well— established symbols. The myth that there is a small number of “correct” sigils and a great variety of “wrong” ones for entities (generally demons), whose names are often little else but mutilati ons of misunderstood older terms, 1 has confused the minds of even highly experienced old hands. Such misinformation should no longer be tolerated. Of course, even “wrong'' dogmas can develop their own, definitely real, magical egregore in the course of time. But we should no longer be interested in struggling with the astral garbage whic h others have been creating for centuries. Spare has certainly opened—probably without an expressed intention to do so—our eyes to an atavism different from the one discussed in chapter 6, for he has shown us the origin of all magical symbolism— the human soul itself! His message is that those magical sigils which truly work derive from our own unconscious and will return again to their source to begin their work after being impregnated by our will. Naturally, and this applies to all magic, one might gain the false impression that it would be much less of a strain to get everything organized and prepared straight from the horse's mouth of a “Great Illuminated True Master of Wisdom,'' but this has nothing to do whatsoever with practical magical success.

So please, view the examples given in this study for what they are—examples only. Don't use them lazily and heedlessly. This could definitely be dangerous! At the beginning you will need perhaps a quarter of an hour or so for your first individual sigil, but by your fifth or si xth sigil it will take you only a couple of minutes. This effort will certainly prove to be worthwhile if you consider the probable success. As I said before, sigil magic is probably one of those magical disciplines th at may be the fastest and easiest to learn. Usually, you will need nothing more than a sheet of paper and a pen. With some experience, you will have finished the whole operation, including activation and subsequent ba nishing, within less than five to ten minutes.

Th e secret lore and the occult in general were triumphant , and there were good reasons for this: the triumph of materialist positivism with its Manchester industrialism was beginning to show its first malice, resulting in social and psychological uprooting; the destruction of nature had already begun to bear its first poisonous fruits. In br ief, it was a time when it seemed appropriate to question the belief in technology and the omnipotence of the celebrated natural sciences. Particularly intellectuals, artists and the so-called “Bohemians” became advocates of values critical of civilisation in general as can be seen in the literature of Naturalism, in Expressionist Art and in the whole Decadent Movement, which was quite notorious at the time. ____________ *Reprint from Unicorn , Issue 1/82, pp. 34-38. 1"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"2 / Practical Sigil Magic Austin Osman Spare (1886-1956) was a typical child of this era and, afte r Aleister Crowley, he was definitely one of the most interesting occultists and practicing magicians of the English-speaking world. Nowadays he is basically kn own only in this cultural context; 1 internationally, he has received only some attention in literary circle s at best—ironically, in a footnote! This footnote is found in Mario Praz's pioneering but, unfortunately, rather superficial work La carne, la morte e il diavolo della letteratura romantica (The Romantic Agony, Florence, 1930) where he terms him, together with Aleister Crowley, a “satanic occultist” 2 —and that is all. Nevertheless, this important work has at least led many an occult researcher familiar with literature to Spare. Compared with Aleister Crowley's enigmatic and infamous life, Austin Osman Spare's existence certainly seemed to befit only a foot note. Despite his various publications after the turn of the century, he remained practically unnoticed until the late sixties. He was born in 1886, the son of a London police officer, and we know very little about his childhood. He claimed to have experienced while a child an initiation of sorts by an elderly witch, one Mrs. Paterson who, as far as we know, must have been quite a Wiccan-like character. Spare found his intellectual and creative vocation as an artist and illust rator, and he attended the Royal College of Art where he soon was celebrated as a forthcoming young artist. But he rebelled against a bourgeois middle-class career in the arts. Disgusted by commercialism, he retreated from the artistic scene soon afterwards, though he still continued editing various magazines for quite a while."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Austin Osman Spare and His Theory of Sigils / 3 From 1927 until his death, he virtually lived as a weird hermit in a London slum, wh ere he sometimes held exhibitions in a local pub. People have compared his life with that of H. P. Lovecraft and certainly he too was an explorer of the dark levels of the soul. Around the beginning of the First World War, he released some privately published editions, and today one can acquire—at least in Great Britain—numerous, usually highly expensive reprints of his works. However, we are primarily interested in two volumes, namely his well-known Book of Pleasure (Se1f- Love): The Psychology of Ecstasy (London, 1913) 3 and Kenneth Grant's excellently researched book 4 in which he, as leader of his own brand of O.T.O. ( Ordo Templi Orientis ) and as an expert on Crowley, deals with the practical aspects of Spare's sy stem as well, Spare's actual philosophy will not be analyzed in depth here because this is not really necessary for the practice of sigil theory and it would lead away from the subject of this study. Before we begin with Spare's theory of sigils, it is perhaps useful to write a few words about the part sigils play in a magical working. Occidental magic is known to rest on two main pillars, namely on will and on imagination . Connected with these are analogous thinking and symbolic images. For example, Agrippa uses a special sigil for each of the planetary intelligences. These are not, as has been a ssumed for quite some time, arbitrarily constructed, nor were they received by “revelation,” but rather they are based on cabbalistic considerations. 5"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"4 / Practical Sigil Magic The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn also employed sigils as “images of the soul s'' of magical entities, which enabled the magician to es tablish contact with them; nonetheless, the technique of their construction was not explained. The same may be said for O.T.O. under Crowley's leadership and for the Fraternitas Saturni under Gregorius. The name Agrippa already hints at the fact that magical sigils have a long hi storical tradition, which we will not discuss here because then we would have to cover the whole complex of occult iconology as well. In general, people think of ''corr ect'' and “incorrect” sigils. The grimoires of the late Middle Ages were often little else but “magical recipe books'' (the frequently criticized Sixth and seventh Books of Moses basically applies the same procedure of ''select ingredients, pour in and stir”), and these practitioners believed in the following principle: to know the “true'' name and the ''true'' sigil of a demon means to have power over it. Pragmatic Magic, which deve loped in the Anglo-Saxon realms, completely tidied up this concept. 6 Often Crowley's revolt in the Golden Dawn—at first in favor of but soon against Mathers—is seen as the actual beginning of modern magic. It would certainly not be wrong to say that Crowley himself was an important supporter of Pragmatic thought in modern magic. But in the end, the Master Therion pref erred to rema in within the hierarchical Dogmatic sy stem due to his Aiwass- revelation in Liber Al vel Legis . His key phrase “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. Love is the law, love under wil1,' ' as well as his whole Thelemic concept, prove him a Dogmatic magician. "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Austin Osman Spare and His Theory of Sigils / 5 Not so Austin Osman Spare. He seems to derive from the individual-anarchistic directi on so that we may describe his philosophy, without undue exaggeration, as a mixture of Lao-Tse, Wicca and Max Stirner. English magic of the turn of the century was also influenced by an important young science which would actually achieve its major triumphs only after the Second World War—the psychology of Sigmund Freud. Before that. Blatvatsky's Isis Unveiled and The Secret Doctrine , as well as Frazer's The Golden Bough , had given important impulses to the occult in general. William James's comparative psychol ogy of religion influenced deeply the intellectuality of this time, but Freud, Adler, and especially Carl G, Jung ev entually effected major breakthroughs. From then on, people started to consider the unconscious in earnest. This apparent digression, whic h had to be ke pt very short due to lack of space, is in reality a very important basis for the discussion that follows. We will not analyze in depth by whom Spare was influenced. Lao-Tse and Stirner having already been mentioned, we might note numerous others from Swinburne to Crowley himself, in whose order, the A.'.A.'., Sp are had been a member at least for a short while. Rather, we will discuss his greatest achievement—his psychological approach towards magic. This leads us to magical practice proper.

It is of no"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"6 / Practical Sigil Magic import whether a sigil is the “correct” one or not, but it is crucial that it has been creat ed by the magician and is therefore meaningful to him/her. Because s/he has constructed it for personal use, the sigil easily becomes a catalyst of his/her magical desire, and sometimes it will even waken this desire in th e first place. This Pragmatic approach which dominates present-day Anglo-Saxon magic (Israel Regardie, Francis King, David Stephen Skinner, W, B. Gray, Conw ay, Lemuel Johnstone, to name but a few relevant aut hors) goes to show that Austin Osman Spare, rather than Aleister Crowley, should be considered the real Father of modern Pragmatic Magic. 7 In the German-speaking countries, the situation is quite different. Writers like Quintscher, Gregorius, Bardon, Klingsor and even Spiesberger allow but little room to maneuver when cr eating magical coordinates individually. Here the adept is expectedly grow into a ready-made system instead of fashioning one, This is a completely different approach, the value or non-value of which we will not discuss he re. The nearest thing to Pragmatic Magic, existing alr eady in 1917 i.e. 1921 (the date of the second revised edition of his major work on magic as an experimental science), was Staudenmaier. The works by Mahamudra, which have of late been receiving some attention, are mainly of a descriptive nature and deal with traditio ns and new interpretations, thus remaining within the context of German magical heritage; however, they do take heed of recent results in scientific psychology and are, therefore, at least partially related to the Pragmatic approach.

Regardless of the significance or amount of truth one concedes to psyc hology/psychoanalysis, we all are infiltrated by its way of thinking and its vocabulary. So even we magicians will ha ve to attain to a critical, sensible look at it. It will be left to another era to find different models of explanation, description and practice. How does Spare proceed in practice? Sigils are developed by fusion and stylization of letters (see Figure 1). First of all, a sentence of desire has to be formulated. Let us take the example Spare himself gives in his Book of Pleasure , the declaration of intent: THIS MY WISH TO OBTAIN THE STRENGTH OF A TIGER This sentence must be written down in capitals. Next, all the letters which appear more than once are deleted so that only one of each letter remains. THIS MY W ISH T O O B T A I N THE ST R EN G TH O F A TIGER Thus the following letters remain: T, H, I, S, M, Y, W, O, B, A, N, E, R, G, F. The sigil is created from these letters; it is permissible to consider one part (for example, M) as a reversed W or, seen from the side, as an E. Hence, these three letters do not have to appear in the sigil three separate times. Of course, there are numerous possibilities of represen tation and stylization."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"8 / Pr act ical Sigil Ma gic “This m y wish to obtain the strength of a tiger.” Sigilized this would be: This is m y wish To obtain The strength of a tiger Co mbined as one si gil or Figure 1"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Austin Osman Spare and His Theory of Sigils / 9 However, it is important that in the end the sigil is as simple as possible with the various letters recognizable (even with slight difficulty). The artistic quality of the sigil is irrelevant, but for si mple psychological reasons it should be obvious that you should not just scribble or doodle it in haste. You should st rive to make it to the best of your abilities. The finished sigil, which in the beginning will probably take a few attempts to construe, will then be fixated. You may draw it on parchment, on paper, in the sand, or even on a wall. A ccording to Spare’s short instructions, it should be destroyed after its internalization. Thus, you w ill either burn the parchment; wipe it out in the sand, etc. Spare’s basic idea is that the sigil, together with its meani ng, must be planted into the unconscious. Afterwards, the consciousness has to forget it so that the unconscious can obey its encoded direction without hindrance. Formulating the sentence of desire 8 and drawing the sigil should be done with the utmost concentration. It makes the following activation (“charging”) much easier. When the sigil is ready, it is activated by implanting it into the psyche. This is the most difficult part in this process, and Spare offers only very few hints on practical procedures. However, it is crucial that the sigil is internalized in a trance of sort s. This may take place in a state of euphoria (for example, by means of drugs), in ecstasy (for example, sex magically by masturbation, sexual intercourse or a ritual), or in a state of physical fatigue. For the latter example, eyes and arms may be tired by the magician folding his/her arms behind the head while standing in front of a mirror and staring fixedly at his/her image. The important thing is that it"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"10 / Practical Sigil Magic should click, meaning that the sigil must be internalized spasmodically, which, of course, requires some exercise and control. This procedure may be supported by repeating the sentence of desire rhythmically and monotonously like a mantra, becoming faster and faster; in doing so, one must stare fixedly at the sigil. (In our example of looking into the mirror [a magical mirror may be used, too], it is useful to draw the sigil onto the mirror with water-soluble paint.) After spasmodical internalization, the symbol must be destroyed and deleted from the conscious mind. As mentioned before, from now on it will be the unconscious which has to do the work. In my own practical work I have discovered that it may even be useful to keep the sigil on you, such as wearing a ring engraved with it, etc. But this will depend upon the magician’s individual predilection, and everybody should find his/her own way. Occasionally, it may prove necessary to repeat the whole procedure, especially if the goal is a very problematical one, requiring an outstanding amount of energy. Nevertheless, experience shows that it is of prime importance not to bring back the meaning and aim of the sigil into consciousness at any time. We are, after all, dealing with a technique akin to autosuggestion; thus, the rules are the same as with autosuggestions themselves. Therefore, you may not use negative formulas such as “THIS MY WISH NOT TO...” because very of ten the unconscious tends neither to recognize nor unde rstand this “not,” and you might end up getting the opposite result than that which you originally desired.

Although the threshold to schizophrenia is not as easily crossed with this method as with common evocations, it does involve cutting deeply into the ecology of the psyche , an act which should be considered carefully in any case. The psycho-magical consequences are sometimes quite incalculable. As is well known, the real problem with magic is not so much the question whether it works, but rath er the fact that it does .

Before we start our discussion of the techniques for activating sigils, I would lik e to give you a few more practical tips. The first recommendation involves the method of constructing a sentence of desire . Sigil magic is primarily success magic. It aims at achieving very tangible and verifiable results. Accordingl y, sentences of will should be concrete and specific. Ambiguity will confuse the unconscious and may lead to only partial Success at best,"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"20 / Practical Sigil Magic ll is advantageous since the injunction given BECOME ILL,” but say “THIS MY WISH TO REMAIN HEALTHY.” ans and amulet s is commonly defined in that t experience has shown, as ment ioned in chapter 1, that it is advisable to begin each sentence of desire with the same formula; in our example it was “THIS MY WISH...” One might al so simply say “I WISH...” or “IT IS MY WILL...” or something similar. Specifically mentioning the wi to the unconscious is clearer and easier to understand. Feeble phrasings such as “I WOULD LIKE TO...,” “I WOULD WISH TO...” or “I SHOULD WANT TO...” lack conviction a nd should be avoided. In the end, you will always have to learn from your own experiences and find your own optimal formula. We know from various other systems of manipulation of consciousness that negative formulas are usually not properly compre hended by the unconscious. While the unconscious is capable of understanding the metaphorical language (and sig ils constructed with the word method are really nothing else) in expressions like “eradicate,” “remove” or “avoid,” it does seem to ignore words like “not,” “none,” “nev er,” etc., for most people. Therefore, do not say “THIS MY WISH NOT TO Interestingly enough, this does not apply to all areas of practical magic. For example, the difference between talism alismans are for something while amulets are against something.

Later on, when we look at the theories which purport to explain how sigil magic works, we will realize that this mechanism has less to do with negative wording than with the general problem of how to get around the “psychic censor.” The experi ences of some magicians who have achieved success with negative formulas have confirmed this point of view. But this is an exception to the rule, and you should try to avoid any risk, especially when starting with your practical work. The question as to whether one should formulate precisely or a bit “hazily” is arguable. In my experience, it is not sensible to dictate overly detailed direc tives to the unconscious. Sentences like “THIS MY WISH TO MEET FRANZ BARDON ON THE 17TH OF OCTOBER AT 3:32 P.M.

One should never put too great a strain on the universe. But this is a general problem in practical magic, and the sigil magician is not the only One compelled to tackle it, as it also applies to the ceremonial magician, the s orcerer and the theurgist. Experience shows that it is quite feasible to include the time factor in the senten ce of desire. For example, “THIS MY WISH TO BECOME HEALTHY AGAIN THIS MONTH ,” etc. But an overloaded psychic time schedule in manager fashion would definitely be too much for our magical faculty.

Whereas Pete Carroll in Liber Null (p. 31), following on from other writers, basically sees it as a method of “holding one’s breath in an uncomfortable position until one nearly dies,”: Kenneth Grant 4 regards it as belonging to sex magic. He sees the death posture (referring to Spare himself) as a technique whereby the conscious mind is switched off (that is to say, “intermediately slain” ) by sexual activity, which means that all conscious th oughts will cease. Anyway, the crucial point, as with most magical trances, is that you can achieve a state of non-thinking or no-mind this way, whereby the conscious mind collapses for a short span of time (sometimes, as with an orgasm, only for seconds) and leaves free a direct channe l to the unconscious. In the following text, two non-sexual variants of the death posture, which have proved th emselves well in practice, particularly for people w ho are new to magic and who have little or no training in magical trances, are described."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"The Magical Trance / Activating the Sigils / 33 longer.

Concentrate on the internal tension in your body (do not think of the sigil or its aim!), and hold your breath until you cannot bear it any longer. Continue holding your breath until you truly cannot bear it anymore. Th en you should still hold your breath until you cannot bear it at all any s y t the sigil. If you do this correctly, you will find yourself in a state of almost panic-stricken no-mind—a form of magical trance wher e your unconscious is more responsive to and more recep tive for sigils. Afterwards, as already mentioned, you banish by laughter and by concentrating on something completely different, the more secular the better. One version of this technique has already been described in chapter 1. It is performed by standing in front of a mirror on which you have drawn your sigil with water-soluble colors. Here again, physical over-exertion is employed. Stare into the eyes of your mirror image without fluttering your eyelid s, then cross your arms behind your head or your neck, push your arms backwards as far and uncomfortably as you can, and tense all your muscles while holding your breath (you may also stand on tiptoes) Keep this posture until you cannot bear the tension and/or pain anymore.

After banishing, you can roll up th e paper or parchment and wrap some yarn or silk thread around it. Depending upon which school of “isolation tec hniques” you belong to, you may either seal this roll with pure beeswax or sew it into a piece of silk, linen or leat her, etc. If you want to wear the amulet or talisman, it is advisable to make it into a necklace or tie it to a thong.

This may demand some ingenuity, but any magician needs this, and, here again, practice alone makes for refinement.

Spare’s writings per se are very ambiguous and difficult to follow, and his exposition of the Alphabet of Desire is no exception. Even concerning his original comments we can only rely on Kenneth Grant, 8 who seems intent on concealing more than he wants to divulge. Apparently, Spare conceived the Alphabet of Desire as a system of 22 glyph s, all of them expressing, to use his own words, “aspect s of sexuality.” In none of his writings published to date do we find all of these “letters” fully listed, let al one explained. Nevertheless, we do have a number of clue s as to what Spare meant by them. In general, Grant seems to stick quite strictly to the original and gives us many enlightening insights.

Additionally, there are four categories as a mirror of the psyc he created by chains of associations. Although some overlappings may occur occasionally, one should not be misled to forget that these are truly two entirely different approaches. The Alphabet of Desire as a Structuring principle Pete Carroll has presente d us, in his well c and precise manner, with this model in Liber Null (pp. 76-87). Unfolding his system, he does not base it— as did Spare—on purely sexual functions. Strictly speaking, his system is more of an “Alphabet of Emotions.” These emotions he arranges as “complementary dualisms ”: FRIGHT/ATTRACTION JOY/TERROR, GREED/AVERSION, etc. Not all of these complementary dualisms will seem convincing at first glance. For example, it may not be absolutely clear to everybody why ATRO PHY/FRUSTRATION and RELEASE/DISSOLUTION should be seen as supplementary opposites , and even his scant explanations do not help us a lot. Incidenta lly, he does not stick strictly to Spare’s division of 22 e ither, so we are justified in viewing his system as being an original creation of his own, following the Spare tradition. Carroll’s matrix will not be explained in detail here, but rather we will us e it as an illustration to demonstrate by this one example how anyone can create his/her own Alphabet of emotions in doublets : LUST/DESTRUCTION; DISSOLUTION/RELEASE; ATTACHMENT/LOA- THING; RAPTURE/ANGER; GREED/AVERSION; ATTRACTION/FRIGHT; JOY/TERROR; ATROPHY/"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"66 / Practical Sigil Magic which in his stem covers the so-called “somatic emotions,” namely But this is not the end to his system.

The Mercurial form indicates stat es of over- stimulation and dissolution of consciousness followed by catharsis or ecstasy (p. 76). The Sulphurous form indicates “the normal functional mode of the emotion,” thus lying in between the Mercurial and Earthy mode, both of which derive from the first principle, comparable to the state of the “prima materia” in alchem y.

The fundamental rationale of this practice is Darwin’s Theory of Evolutio n. I’m sure you are familiar with Darwin’s theory that man is but the momentary end product of a long process of ev olution that has been going on for millions of years and which has led from unicellular organisms and reptiles to mammals, including ourselves. Unlike popular “Vulgar Darwinism” (which was mainly monitored by the C hurch), Darwin did not so much claim that “man derives from monkey” but rather that we carry in us the entire heritage of all life forms and that we literally incorporate it.

In other words, it is not as if we were completely finished with our former evolut ionary stages, as if we had totally overcome them and la id the ry, in fact. The informat ion of these earlier stages of our deve1opment is stored in our genes up to the present day and, according to Spare and many other magicians, it may be revitalized and tapped. (The parallels to Carl G. Jung’s concept of the collective unconscious—at least in one of its possible interpretations—should be obvious.)

He does not use the word so much in the sense of “longing for something (the source),” although this may be included as well, but rather employs it to signify an act of conscious revitalization of old, archaic structures of the consciousness. Consequently, Spare tried to go back into early, pre-human stages of consciousness by activating genetic or hereditary memory . This, for him, was not an end in itself, for his basic premise was that our greatest magical power, probably even the source of magic itself, lies hidden in these early stages of evolution. This assumption is confirmed if we take a look at the practices of Siberian or South American shamans or various African fetish priests, e.g., work with power animals, animal clan totems, etc. Practice also confirms this over and over again. Only when the magica l will (which Spare is fond of calling “belief”) has become “organic,” meaning unconscious and carnal , is it, according to Spare, most effective.

Nevertheless, I urgently advi se experimenting with the Alphabet of Desire in this field because here its abilities can be developed to the fullest and because its energy seems to be best adapted to this line of magic. Working with a structured alphabet provides us with the additional advantage that our experien ce may gain more stability and, in some cases, more substantiality On the other hand, an associatively constructed alphabet often provides us with very powerful instantly successful, sigils because its glyphs pop up even more “directly” from the unconscious and the hereditary memory than those of other techniques with the possible exception of the pictorial methods. It’s also true that these two different methods of constructing the alphabet ma y be combined with one another.

This technique seems to be reasonable, but then, of cour se, it is suited only for long- term operations.

Don’t start off in a dogmatic spirit, though. Dare to experiment, make changes where you feel they may be necessary, and always aspire to develop your own techniques and methods. Sigil magic lives by the individuality of the magician; generally, people who stick to every letter of laws or rules make very little progress. Even though one of its major strong points lies in the field of success magic, sigil magic serves the individual’s spiritual development as we ll. It can open completely new universes to us—an unlimited number of universes of experience—and eventually it will lead us back to the sources of magical power itself. SALVE ATQUE VALE!
