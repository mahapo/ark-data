Facing the unknown has always attracted peoples interest. Perhaps, th is is why I was compelled to the investigation of the mysteries exposed in this book. In this country of public trust and accountability, it is ironic to fi nd a national secret kept hidden from the public for nearly two hundred years. Yet, this secret has always been in plain view. You only had to be a bird to see it. My own search began in 1984 while planning a trip to Washington D.C., a city visited by millions of Americans and people from around the world. I only had three days to visit the Capital, so before making my trip I laid out on a map the routes I would follow in visiting the Capital City of the United States. It did not take me long to uncover some interesting symbols forming on that map. During my visit to the city, I became more aware of the possible importance of the symbols. The mere size of Washington prevents anyone from observing these symbols from any one vantage point, other than from the top of the Washington Monument. But, the Washington Monument was never completely erected until February 21, 1885, ninety-five years after the city and many of the symbols were established. There are many of books about the history of this great city, yet all ignore any reason for the strange street layout of Washington D.C. The more I looked at the various maps of Washington D.C. the more symbols I uncovered and the more questions I began to ask. Why were these symbols laid out in our Nation's Capital? Who authorized the design of the city around these symbols? What do the symbols mean? How might these symbols be used? Little did I know my questions would even tually, lead me on a very unusual treasure hunt. The mysterious street lines of Washington D.C. are a true national treasure that raise more questions than answers. It is hoped that this book may answer some of those questions, as well as raise a few."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Chapter 1 THE OTHER LINES SHADOWS AND LIGHT Large line drawings on the ground arc nothing new. Throughout man's history, we can find many examples of such drawings. There appears to be some aspect in all cultures that produces large line drawings on the earth, which can only be viewed from the ai r. Most archaeologists believe that these various cultures were paying respect to their gods. Many ground drawings represent known astronomical observatories for st udying the stars and the seasonal changes for an agricultural based society. Still, other theo ries speculate about landing fields and directional markers for interstellar space cr aft for extraterrestrials who might have visited the plant Earth thousands of years ago. One thing is sure, large ground drawings have been a part of the history of mankind. NAZCA LINES OF PERU One of the most famous of the ground draw ings are the Nazca lines of central Peru. Archaeologist believe that the Peruvian Indians had the ability of hot air balloon flight, which was needed in viewing the layout of these lines. The lines take on the shapes of many types of animals and symbols, which may represent constellations and aspects of the early Indian culture. Another belief is that these ground lin es were landing fields for ancient astronauts. Near the Nazca lines are ancient Peruvian cities, where religious rites were carried out using mind altering drugs. It is possible that these lines were associated with the religious rituals of a society involved in altering states of conscious ness. Scientist still have not fully determined the exact reason for the Nazca Plain line drawings.

Archaeologist have conjectured that the motif of the serpent swallowing the egg depicts an astronomical event of religious significance. It looks a lot like a sperm cell connecting with an egg cell at conception, so the motif may have something to do with a fertility ritual. Thoug h, it is hard to believe the early American Indian could view the microscopic structure of cells at fertility. In the book Archaeastrono my in pre-Columbia America, it is suggested the effigy mounds and other earth works were designed on the pattern of the stars and constellations. A traditional image of a lunar eclipse in Asia is the moon being swallowed by a serpent, and this may be part of the meaning of the Ohio mound. The seven loops of its body and the tightly winding tail is seen as a representation of the seven st ars in Ursa Minor and their annual rotation round the pole star. A more esoteric interpretation of the loops woul d be the seven levels of the universe or seven heavens as spoken of by many re ligions around the world, with the mark of Aries at the top of the seventh heaven. The symbol illustrates the principles of the chakras and the sephorit from Hindu and Jewish mysticism. The Aries symbol is clearly seen within the serpent head motif. It represents Asmodeus, the guardian of the treasure of Zion or Solomon, as presented in Jewish history and folklore. There are even theo ries speculating that the serpent earth mound in Ohio was built by the fabl ed Lost Tribes of Israel.

This illustrates that an architectural structure may be designed to represent an alternate meaning other than a traditional building. The Gaza Pyramid Complex yields an interesting triangulation. Lines of sights for finding the winter solstice and maximum southern position of the 18.61 year cycle of the moon can be triangulated around the three pyramids. Soviet space scientist Alexander Abramov found that the three large pyramids on the Giza plateau are arranged to an Egyptian geometric configuration called the abaka.

It appears to be more of a private venture than a public project. Private in more ways than one. The newly formed Congress established as one of the newly elected President's first duties to chose the location of the city to be the Capital of the United States. After a location was determined, a new city would be established for the Nation's Capital. It was the responsibility of George Washington to determine the sight for the Capital. But, was this location already chosen before the forming of the United States? Washington, D.C. is found in the same general geographic location as Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement in North America. Most history books tell us that Washington's location was established as a compromise between the So uthern and Northern States. But, Baron De Graffenried (a Swiss baron) trie d to establish a colony at th e exact location of Washington, D.C. as the preferred site for his project. De Graffenried stat es, \"I believe that there are scarcely any places in the world more beautiful and better situated than this of the Potomac... There is a very pretty island (Theodore Roosevelt Island) of very good ground, and facing it, an angle between the great Potomac River and another little river named Gold Creek (now Rock Creek).\" The land on which much of the Capital City is built today was owned by Ninian Beall, a Scot who owned a 1,503-acre trac k called \"Inclosure.\" Two other tracks called \"Beall's Levels and the Rock of Dumbarton\" make up current day Washington, D.C. and Georgetown. Was George Washington continuing a project established by De Graffenried and Beall 60 years earlier?"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"10 A History of Washington, D.C. WHERE DOES LENFANT FIT IN? History tell us that the Frenchman Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant was the city planner for Washington, D.C. But, a few books establish the fact that L'Enfant wa s really the middleman working from a set of original plans develope d by George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. Both Washington and L'Enfant had two things in common. First, they both served in the War for Independence, L'Enfant being a French volunteer in the Corps of Engineers. Second, they were both members of the newly formed Society of Cincinnati. L'Enfant had been asked by Baron von Steuben and members of the Society of Cincinnati to design the insignia for this exclusive group. This was the job for someone who understood symbols related to the principles of the Society. His work so impressed George Washington, the president of the Society of Cincinnati; that L'Enfant was asked to work on several national projects. Later L'Enfant designed the courthouse in New York, where the first Congress of the United States held its meetings. History tells us, it was a combination of his work with the Society of Cincinnati and the New York Congress building that made George Washington chose L'Enfant as the designer for the city plan of Washington, D.C. It appears L'Enfant was hand picked for his ability in the use of symbolic design, instead of his ability as a city planner. This is most true when you consider the fact that L'Enfant was not known as a city planner, or does it appear he designed any city plans before Washington, D.C. Based on a letter to L'Enfant, date August 18, 1791, Jefferson co mmunicated his ideas for the map of the city directly to L'Enfant. Some historians believe L'Enfant adopted these ideas and expanded on them. THE MISSING NOTES - A COVER-UP? It is unclear if George Washington, Thom as Jefferson, or Pierre L'Enfant himself determined the various symbols that form the streets of Washington, D.C. Many things indicate that L'Enfant was just following orders from Washington and Jefferson. In the book L'Enfant and Washington, it is pointed out that Washington was pulling all the strings, since the plans appear to be \"orally conveyed\" by Washington to L'Enfant. The fact that three years of George Washin gton's diary has mysteriously disappeared, prevents us from knowing exactly what sort of communications occurred between George Washington and L'Enfant. In addition, corre spondence with Jefferson concerning the development of the proposed \"Plan\" have disappeared. The mysterious disappearance of this historical information concerning both Washington and Jefferson and their involvement in the original design of Washington, D.C. wreaks of a cover up - perhaps the original Watergate. Is it possible that the missing dairies and correspondence have been intentionally lost to maintain secrecy about the true nature of the development of the Nation's Capital?"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"A History of Washington, D.C. 11 It is known that the Secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson, issued the orders for L'Enfant to design the city and public buildings. Washington, Jefferson, and L'Enfant met twice weekly, every Wednesday and Saturday evenings to disc uss the \"Plan.\" Both Jefferson and Washington felt an affinity with Roman institutions, law, citizenship, and architecture; so many Roman features like dooms and columns were adopted to the \"Plan.\" Andrew Ellicott was the surveyor who laid out the city and its streets. He established 40 boundary stones one mile apart, producing a te n mile square boundary. The center point was fixed by night observations from a level platform on the hill where the Capital Building was to be built. Records were kept on the north st ar and the moon to esta blish a line due east and west, another straight line due north and south, with the center of the Capital dome at the point of intersection. Ellicott was responsible for finishing the \"Plan\" when L'Enfant was fired. The city that L'Enfant's original plans pr oposed for the Capital City is nothing like the present day Washington. The symbols in the st reets of Washington, D.C. today appear to have evolved from L'Enfant's basic design. Th is basic design did include the layout of \"different shapes\" as specified in the written legends that accompanies the original set of plans. The following is the original legend for the plans for Washington, D.C. \"OBSERVATIONS EXPLANATORY OF THE PLAN I. The positions for the different Grand Edifices, a nd for several Grand Square s or Areas of different shapes as they are laid down, were first dete rmined on the most advantageous ground, commanding the most extensive prospects, and the better susceptible of such improvements as the various intents of several objects may require. II. Lines or Avenues of direct communication have been devised, to connect the separate and most distant objects with the principal, and to preserve through the whole a reciprocity of sight at the same time. Attention has been paid to the passing of these leading avenues over the most favorable ground for prospect and convenience. III. North and South lines, intersected by other running due East and West, make the distribution of the city into streets, squares etc., and those lines have been so combined as to meet at certain given points with those divergent avenues, so as to form on the spaces \"first determined,\" the different Squares or Areas which are all proportional in magnitude to the number of avenues leading to them.\" Though the legend does not name or explain the specific shapes or symbols, it does make clear that areas of \"different shapes\" were in the original plans proposed to L'Enfant by Washington or Jefferson. Now take the words from the legend that ha ve been underlined and think about their meaning. Is it possible anothe r meaning is being expressed other than the layout of city streets? When land in the city limits of Washington, D.C. was offered for sell, property owners demanded copies of the city plan. L'Enfant refu sed claiming that if the maps were made public before the principal buildings we re established, unsightly struct ures would be built on the best locations. This caused the sell of lots to fail, preventing the government from getting the"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"12 A History of Washington, D.C. needed funds to finish the city on time. The President was forced to dismiss L'Enfant in 1792, only one year after he had started work on the city. In 1812, Secretary of War James Monroe ask L'Enfant to build Fort Washington south of the city to defend against future British attacks. Again, his work was incomplete and he was dismissed. He spent his remaining years as a grounds keeper residing at the Chilham Castle Manor, the estate of his benefactor, William Dudley Digges, at Gree n Hills, Maryland. He died on June 14, 1825 and was buried in obscurity until 1909. In 1909 his remains were moved with military escort to the Capital building, where he laid in state for three hours. During that time, thousands of Americans paid their respects to the man who had planned the Nation's Capital City. On noon of that day, he was buried at a honored vantage point in Arlington National Cemetery. On May 22, 1911 a tombstone that now marks his grave was dedicated. The tombstone is engraved with a motif of the first map of L'Enfant's \"Plan.\" Is it possible that L'Enfant had designed something so special in his city plan that no one of his day could appreciate or understand it? It is possible that someone around 1900 recognized the value of his work? Placing the bo dy of an architect who does not finish what he starts, in the Capital Building Rotunda for public ceremonies eighty-four years after his death for only three hours, sounds very unusual. According to the history books, thousands of people appeared for the public viewing at the Capital. Can thousands of people really pass in precession through the Rotunda in three hours? Is something else really taking place in these ceremonies? If Washington and Jefferson are the real originators of the design; why is L'Enfant, who was dismissed from the job, recei ving all the credit? Is someone trying to side track us with a re-write on history? The Capital Rotunda has a secret of its own. Hidden below the floor of the Rotunda is a Crypt Room which was originally designed to be the resting place of George Washington. You will see a model of the Capital Building on display in this room. Beneath the center of the Crypt floor (marked by a star) is the vacan t tomb of George Washington. This is an American version of Napoleon's tomb. Washingt on's resting place is at Mt. Vernon, but his remains were nearly moved to the Rotunda in 1832. Space was provided in the construction of the central section of the Rotunda between 1818-1829 for the tomb by a joint resolution passed by Congress. On Feb. 13, 1832 Congress executed an original resolution to have the body of Washington moved to the Crypt Room. But, John A. Washington, grand-nephew of George Washington, refused consent. The bodies of Kennedy, Lincoln, McKinley, Garfield, Harding, Taft, Hoover, Wilson, Stevens, Dewey, Pershing, MacArthur, L'Enfant, and two unknown soldiers have been placed on the catafalque found in the tomb. There is another well-known underground Crypt beneath a dome. It is the tomb of St. Peter beneath the Basilica at the Vatican."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"A History of Washi ngton, D.C. 13 "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"14 A History of Washington, D.C.

The city has experienced many changes in the street layout that can be groupe d in stages. Each stage has added new symbols to the original \"Plan.\" The next few pages illustrates the changes in the streets of Washington over the past 200 years. The L'Enfant-Ellicott stage was started on April 15, 1791 and was finished in 1799. Congress moved to town the following year. On Saturday, November 22, 1800 the Congress met for the first time in Washington at a joint meeting in the Senate Chamber of the unfinished Capital Building. President Adam s made a speech at this first meeting. \"... it would be unbecoming the representatives of this n a t i o n to assemble for the first time in this solemn temple, without looking up to the Supr eme Ruler of the Universe and Imploring His blessing.\" Why did Adams refer to the Senate wing of th e unfinished Capital building as a \"temple?\" THE BATTLE WITH THE BRITISH IN 1814 The attack on Washington, D.C. by the British was the only time the Capital of United States was invaded since its conception. On August 24, 1814 the British began their destruction that went on through the night and th e next morning. Only the Patent Office was spared destruction because Dr. Thornton convinced them \"to burn what would be useful to all mankind, would be as barbarous as formerly to bum the Alexandrian Library, for which the Turks have since been condemned by all enlightened nations.\" But, on August 25 a great storm blew up, putting out the fires and driving out the invaders. According to Mary Ingle, thirteen at the time; \"I well remember the terrific tornado which drove the enemy in haste to their ships, from which [hey were in dread of being cut off... The sk y changed from the peculiar leaden hue portending a wind storm, into almost midnight blackness. Then came the cras h and glare on incessant thunder and lightning, and the wild beating of the rain ........ Later we encountered a group of British officers taking a last drink from the old pump. 'Great God, Madam!' said Admiral Cockburn, 'is this the kind of storm to which you are accustomed in this infern al country?' 'No, sir,' was the reply; 'this is a special interposition of Providence to drive our enemies from the city.' 'Not so, Madam,' he answered; 'it is rather to aid them in destruction of your city.'

Synonyms; amulet, charm. An amulet or talisman is strictly a material object; a charm may be a movement or a form or words. An amulet is ordinarily worn upon the person as a protection against disease, injury, or death. A talisman is any object supposed to work wonders, like Aladdin's lamp, whether kept in one's possession or not. 1 Washington, D.C. is known today as one of the worlds most important cities. Its original street layout is commonly thought of as ingenuous in allowing the free flow of traffic in a city plan designed for future expansion. Yet, an aerial view of the city in the eyes of someone knowledgeable in astronomical, astrological, historical, religious, magical, and occult symbols - offers a different reason for the street layout of Washington, D.C. There are many symbols that take shape from an aerial view of the city streets of Washington. The symbols do not appear to be accidental. Firs t, because so many symbols are present and second because of the location of these symbols to key buildings of Government, to one another, to other streets, and to the north-south and east-west axis. The street layout of Washington, D.C. might be considered a Labyrinth (an arrangement of buildings around enclosed paths leading to a ce nter that is difficult to find.) To enter a Labyrinth and return from its center, symbolizes an aspect of spiritual death and resurrection. It appears the existence of the strange street lines of Washington, D.C. was not unknown to people of the past. When Charles Dickens first visited Washington, D.C, he climbed to the top of the Capital Building to get a bird's-eye view. From the following quote, it is evident Dickens could see something very important. \"It is sometimes called the City of Magnificent Di stances, but it might with greater propriety be termed the City of Magnificent Intentions; for it is only on taking a bird's-eye view of it from the top of the Capital that one can at all comprehend the vast designs of its projector, an aspiring Frenchman.\""},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The Talisman 23"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"24 The Talisman The following diagrams illustrates the locations of the predominate symbols observed in the streets of Washington, D.C. Many of these symbols can be associated with magic, ancient wisdom, religion, astronomy, and secret societies. If these symbols are a monument of some sort, then they make up the largest monument in the United States. Nineteen million tourist will visit Washington, D.C. each year to see many national monuments. But, few are aware of this first monument established by Ge orge Washington and Thomas Jefferson. THE SHIELD OF ZION - THE HEXAGRAM The Star of David is often associated with the Jewish faith, the flag of Israel, or God. But, this symbol goes back many thousands of years and has been used by many cultures to represent a common symbolic idea. Thousands of years ago it was associated with the process of birth. The symbol was adopted for the flag of Israel from an emblem of the Zionist Organization of 1897. Early man chose the triangle as a divine shap e. The triangle was chosen because it was the shape of the pubic hair area on both men and women. This area of the human body was known to have something to do with the most mysterious of early man's mysteries that of human birth. Thus, the crossing of two triangles represents an ancient birth symbol and sexual rite. The idea was expanded upon by early religious sects that revered the act of sex and birth. History records sex rituals as a main part of many early organized religions. Aspects of these ancient religious beliefs continues in most modern day religions that ask its believers to abstain from sex except for conception. The result is a religious legacy that has pasted on from this ancient tradition. The symbol was adopted to currently represent the most mysterious of all mysteries, the Jewish God - the birth creator. The two triangles pointing up and down often symbolizes man as God. The triangle pointing up refers to the male and the triangle pointing down refers to the female. The two triangles sometimes are referred to as fire and water by alchemy. It is often associated with the fabled Philosopher's Stone itself, which is said to be made of fire and water. The Star of David or Hexagram is also used in many cults and religious rituals associated with both magic and sorcery. This symbol is commonly used in the invoking or banishing of demons, spirits, or angels to aid or do the bidding of the practitioner of the occult arts. Most books of magic and the occult arts give a common explanation for the use of the hexagram shape as a symbol for r eceiving guidance from the spirit world. To the magician, the Hexagram is the \"Sign of the Macrocosm.\" Its six angles represent the six days of Creation, with the center repres enting the seventh day, or period of rest. Each re-entering angle of a Hexagram is a ray radiati ng from the divine. In occult rituals it is traced with the single point uppermost in the directi on of the east, the west, or the north, or the south. It is the sealing of the \"Astral Image of Nature\" under the Sephiroth. It is a symbol frequently attributable to the Sun. According to the Martinism beliefs of Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin, the Macrocosm Ceremony deals with invoking and uniting with the \"guardian angle\" or \"higher self which is a small part of a divine intelligence."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"The Talisman 25 There is one Hexagram found in the street lines of Washington, D.C.

The triangle pointing up represents the evolution of man back to spirit. The following diagram represents this two fold principle. This is a universal principle that is evident in all the great religious books like the various versions of the Bible, the Zohar, and the Koran.

The sign in an upward position represents the \"Universal Man.\" THE UNIVERSAL MAN"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"28 The Talisman The pentagram is used in the rituals of the occult arts, such as the Golden Dawn, the Rosicrucians, and Wica for the banishing and invoking of spirits. According to the book The Key of Solomon, the archangel Gabriel is invoked on a Thursday before daybreak, \"His power is great and he can do much good in which he will instruct you.\" A pentagram can be traced in two different wa ys. First, by moving from every second point, thus producing a pentagon. Second, by moving from every third point, drawing out the pentagram. The pentagram is associat ed to the Fifth Sephirah, Geburah. When the pentagram has a single point pointing upwards, it represents the \"Sign of the Microcosm.\" This is a good symbol, representing the universal man with his arms and legs extended while adoring his Creator. It is symbo lic of the control of the spirit over matter. With the single point pointing downwards, it is an evil symbol. It is associated with the head of a goat and means the control of reas on over the blind forces of matter. THE RITUAL OF THE PENTAGRAM The ritual using the pentagram symbol involves a form of prayer. Invoking of spirits occurs in the morning and banishing of spirits occurs in the evening. The pentagram ritual aids in ridding impure thoughts. A magician normally faces the east and produces a mental image of what he is trying to accomplish. Depending on the type of ritual being performed, the magician will sometimes walk on a pentag ram path, or trace out th e star on the ground from one of the five starting points. Each star ting point is associated with a certain spirit being called upon for guidance. There are three pentagram stars found in the Wa shington Street Line Complex. One is the Major Pentagram associated with the Capital Build ing. The second, and easier to see, is the Minor Pentagram next to the White House. The third is the Giant Pentagram that extends out from the Washington Monument. The Major Pentagram and Giant Pentagram are pointing west, with the Minor Pentagram pointing south.

Satanist along with other occults and secret societies share a number of symbols and rituals, but several are unique and distinctive to Satanism. The best known is the inverted pentagram. The Horn ed God in the form of the goat head of Mendes is often depicted, with the pentagram mixed with the goat, or stamped upon the goat's forehead.

Like the Star of David, it is really only the crossing of two triangles. It definite ly symbolizes a Masonic meaning, possibly similar to the Universal Life Principal. Those first seeing this symbol will naturally say that it was established to honor the many Masons who fought in the Revolutionary War. That sounds well, until you discover: 1. It has never been mentioned in any to urist guidebooks on Washington, D.C. For that matter, none of the Washington lines or sym bols are mentioned in any tourist guidebooks- until now. 2. To pay homage to anything as a memorial, you have to see it. Yet, no one can see this symbol unless he can fly or stands a top th e Washington Monument. This may be why the Washington Monument is a building instead of a solid obelisk structure. 3. The square of this symbol did not take shape with the onset of the building of the Nation's Capital. Early city plans of Wa shington do not show the detailed layout. So this symbol has been added to the Washington Complex, over the past two hundred years. It appears to have taken shape in the mid-1800s. The amazing thing about the Square and Compass is the detail of the compass shape. It has handles, moving joints, and even a compass spri ng that can be seen in the layout based around the Capital Building. The layout of a compass shape in a city's st reets is not unique to Washington, D.C. The Plaza de Popolo in Rome and the Vatican both have the shape of a bow compass laid out in the streets with an obelisk at its center. The Vatican compass shape is closed, opposite of the opened Washington compass shape. There may be some hidden symbolism behind the closed compass since the Vatican, as part of its doctrine, is opposed to Freemasonry. Popes Clement and Benedict excommunicated many Masons from the Catholic faith. Pope Leo XII in his famous anti-mason letter, Hummanum Genus, expressed the church's opinion of Masons at that time. \"The human race, after its most miserable defec tion, through the wilds of the devil, from its Creator, God, the giver of celestial gifts, has di vided into two different and opposing factions; of which one fights ever truth and virtue, and the other for opposites. One is the Kingdom of God on earth, the true church of Jesus Christ,......... the ot her is the Kingdom of Satan .......... but at this time those who support the worst facti on seem all to be conspiring and striving most vigorously, led and aided by what is called Freemasonry, a so ciety of men most widely spread and firmly established.\" Albert Pike, a Scottish Rite Mason in the Unite d States replayed to the letter as follows: \"There has never been in this country any o pposition on the part of Freemasonry to Catholicism as a religion. ...We have not even felt indignati on when educational establishments of Catholicism have made priest of our sons and nuns of our daughters. With 100,000 members of the Catholic faith in its lodges in various Latin countries of the world, the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite could have no dislike to Catholicism as a religion.

But, the Vatican compass is laid out on such an axis with th e obelisk in the center of the Va tican Plaza. The Vatican compass in many respects is a direct opposite of the Washington compass. The Vatican compass is closed and points to the east, with an obelisk situated in the compass shape. The Washington compass is opened to the west, with the obelisk situated outside the compass. There are other shapes associated with the Vatican bow compass. To the side of the compass, is the shape of a builders level. Mo st carpenters will notice the water bubble level at the center. It appears inte rconnected to another compass or gage behind the bow compass shape which appears to have thumb wheel gages. This other compass shape is based around the shape of St. Peter's Basilica and may represent a set of calipers. Next to the builder's level is an angled structure that lo oks like a builder's square or angle gage. Of course, the whole layout looks a lot like the shape of a single inst rument that can reference a compass or a set of calipers off of an angle from a fixed le vel position.

The Giant Pentagram of Rome can be established from the location of obelisk, towers, and key buildings in the city. It is altogether possible that the \"Plan\" for Washington, D.C. was developed around the city plan for Rome.

This is definitely an ancient symbol of birth which is associated with various buildings established at key locations around these two triangles. In grade school, all Americans are taught that George Washington was the \"Father of our Country.\" Most of us take this as a homage to our First President of the United States. But, it is strange that we call George Washington the \"Father of our Country\" when other men may have had more to do with its establishment. For instance, Thomas Jefferson drafted our Declaration of Independence, so the title \"Father of our Country\" may better fit Jefferson. At the end of one of the two equally sized triangles, we have the erect Washington Monument. This stone and masonry obelisk towers 555 feet into the air. The comer stone was laid with Masonic ceremonies by the Grand L odge of the District of Columbia on July 4, 1848. At the other end of the opposing triangle, are two curved lines folding in on each other and meeting at a street that circles the Capital Building. Here the symbolic street layout is using th e Washington Monument as a \"phallic symbol.\" The lines near the Capital are representing the fallopian tubes of a woman, with the Capital centered in the womb - the place of birth. Remember the serpent earth mound in Adams Country, Ohio. It is possible that while George Washington was surveying in Ohio he made visits to this earth works and discovered how it might relate to a fertility ritual, later expressing this in the design of the Capital City? There are a many similarities. Seven streets divide this Birth Symbol of Washington, D.C. The serpent mount has seven coils in its design.

Many ancient religious text refer to the two great ages of Taurus the bull and Aries the ram. About every 2000 years, the due east position in the northern hemisphere will locate in the night sky a certain constellation. This constellation has changed from Taurus, to Aries, to the current constellation Pisces because of the rotation of the earth's axis on a 23.5 degree tilt. According to Jewish and Christian scriptures, Moses ushered in the age or Aries and Jesus the age of Pisces. The celestial equato r of the earth remains constant and Aries is always in the east in relation to the earth's position on the celestial equator on the day of the spring equinox. \"Then I saw that a white bull was born with large horns, and all the beast of the field and all the birds of the air feared him and entreated him constantly. I watched until all generations were transformed into white bulls. The first among them became a lamb, and that lamb became a great animal and had great black horns on its head. The Lo ad of the sheep rejoiced over it and over all the oxen. I slept among them and woke and saw everything.\" From the Book of Enoch on Enoch's vision of the coming Messiah.

One landscape by William MacLeod in 1844 shows two horned bulls looking northeast toward the White House of Washington, D.C. Another drawing by Kollner in 1839 shows two bulls running in a field towards a northern direction and is titled \"Northeastern Washington D.C.\" The use of two bulls in the pi ctures is the real give away to the hidden message. There are two stars making up the horns of the bull in the constellation Taurus. Also there are two parallel streets branching out from the White House that point to the position of Taurus on the celestial equator. Both pictures have a horse's ass depicted as the constellation of the Northern Ass. Traditionally fertility religions honor the horned animal, such as the homed bull. Even today the rhinoceros is in da nger of extinction, because many people around the world believe its tusk when crushed and eaten will increase potency in men. The broken horn is often refened to as the horn of plenty or good fortune.

The Knights Templar were formed in 1118 by Hugh de Payens and Geoffrey de Saint-Omer. It was sanctioned to protect Jeru salem for Christian pilgrims by the King of Jerusalem and by the Pope. The Order later developed into a magical group with a Gnostic-like theology. The group gained knowledge on the 'mysteries of true Christianity' from the Johannites, a magical sect existing in Jerusalem at this time. The Johannites believed that John the Baptist was the true Messiah. It is believed that the Templars worshiped his severed head. But, the Templars have been linked to the possession of the Turin shroud, which when folded appears like a head. In either case, each of these two heads might be considered to be the head of the mysterious Baphomet. Two hundred years after its founding, the King of France disbanded the wealthy and powerful organization almost overnight. Jacques de Molay, the leader, was burned at the stake based on charges of black magic. The philosophy of the Kabbalah is attributed to older Hebrew sources. Kabbalists believe the world and nature can be grasped through the understanding of numbers and letters. Their job is to discover the meaning in the numbers and letters from the ancient written records of man. \"Ten\" is their basic number of the universe. By using the ten numbers (the sephirot), all the working principles of life can be organi zed and pictured in the form of a Sephirotic tree. This Sephirot tree emanations God, who is a top of the tree. It is the aim of the magician to climb this tree, using magic, to find the divine God head. Each of the ten Sephirots has a name and quality attributed to it. 1. Kether - being or existence 2. Chochmah - wisdom 3. Binah - intelligence or understanding 4. Chesed - mercy or love 5. Geburah - strength or security 6. Tiphareth - beauty 7. Netzach - firmness 8. Hod - glory 9. Yesod - foundation 10. Malkuth - kingdom. An invisible Sephirot is hidden behind Chochmah and Binah. It is called the Daath- knowledge which is of a sexual kind, spoken of Genesis. Daath is often added to the Sephirot tree of the Kabbalists which practice sex magic."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"46 The Talisman The Sephirot Tree - The Tree of Life - Jacob's Ladder "},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"The Talisman 47 Tarot cards are read based on the layout of the Sephirot.

The Sephirot Tree is often known in the occult arts as the representation of the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge as spoken of in the Ge nesis. It is strange that an American fable apparently written by Parson Weems, also the writer of George Washington's first biography, speaks of another well-known tree. \"Presently George and his made their appearance. George, said his father, do you know who killed that beautiful little cherry-tree yonder in the garden? This was a tough question; and George staggered under it for a moment; but quickly recovere d himself; and looking at his father, with the sweet face of youth brightened with the inexpressible charm of all-conquering truth, he bravely cried out, 'I can't tell a lie, Pa; y ou know I can't tell a lie. I did cut it with my hatchet.' - 'Run to my arms, you dearest boy, cried his father in transpor ts, run to my arms; glad am I, George, that you killed my tree; for you have paid me for it a thousand fold. Such an act of heroism in my son is more worth than a thousand trees, though blossomed with silver, and their fruits of purest gold.\" In reading this story told by Weems, also a Mason, one cannot help notice the similarities to the tree in the Garden of Eden; with Wash ington acting as the Adam of our new nation, this time being praised by his Father. As the sun moves from east to west each day, the shadow of the Washington Monument cuts across the Sephirot shape laid out in the streets. Could Weem's fable really be a cryptic message about the Washington Monument and its association to the street lines? The Kabbalist believes in the cryptic use of letter s and numbers.

Spencer Lewis, of the AROC Rosicrucian Order, found among Jefferson's papers a code many through Jefferso n had invented. It was recognized by Lewis to be a possible Rosicrucian code similar to ancient Rosicrucian secret manuscripts. The Sephirot design has taken shape through seve ral design changes to the original \"Plan.\" The Sephirot is traditionally a ladder design that can be expanded upon as one develops his ability to obtaining his higher self. Many ancient religions speak of the ladder to heaven, or Jacob's ladder as mentioned in the Bible. A chemist looking at a sephirot design might find its appearance similar to a chem ical chain. The biologist might relate this design to the DNA ladder design that creates all living things. Bo th DNA and chemical chains are expressed in terms of coded letters and numbers.

Hauntingly it is staring back at you as you look at the maps of Washington, D.C. The skull and cross bones are to be expected since it is a symbol of Fr eemasonry and the Knights Templars. We have already discused the Knights Templars ' association with magic and the story about the Knights Templars having been linked to a mysterious head. Five possible theories exist on what this head might be. 1. It is the pentagram shape of Baphomet, the goat headed demon. 2. It is the head of Christ as seen from a folded Shroud of Turin. 3. It is the Skull and Cross Bones symbol. 4. It is the head of the unive rse - the Universal Creator. 5. It is Asmodeus the guardian of the Treasure of Solomon. The head worshiped by the Knights Templars may be the commonly known Skull and Cross Bones symbol, which is associated with pirates and buried treasure. The skull is naturally known as the place of the mind, the highest order of thought. Esoteric philosophy is centered around three states of being; the body (physical), the mind (reasoning), and the sprint (the soul). The cross bones represent the physical aspect of man and the skull represents the mind. Together they represent the crossing over to the higher self of the mind and reasoning. The symbol of the Skull and Cross Bones that is now considered to have a negative connotation of death in our society, originally meant the positive crossing over to a higher level of consciousness towards the sprint. The crucifixion of lesus is associated with the same trad ition, with his death on the cr oss at the place of the skull, Golgotha - the crossing over of the spirit at death. The location of the Capital Building, housing the best minds of reason in our country, is situated at that crossing. As we will see, the head worshipped by the Templars and the cr oss bone lines of Washington, D.C. could be something else.

Franklin's publication on the subject, Poor Richard's Almanac, made him a fortune and was one of the most popular books of the period. Viewing from the top of the Washington Monument to the southeast down Virginia Avenue, a line of sight for the winter solstice can be established. Viewing down Indiana Avenue from the Washington Monument produces an almost true line of sight for the summer solstice.

The information concerning the winter solstice in Washington, D.C. reveals a not well-known astronomical observation th at can also be seen from the Vatican in Rome. The basic interpretation derived from the two opposite compass symbols found in Washington, D. C. and the Vatican is also opposite. One compass faces the east and the other faces the west. The Vatican is closed to the rising sun on the day of winter solstice. The Washington compass is open to the rising sun of the winter solstice when viewed from the White House, but the legs are turned away from the rising sun. (see THE VATICAN CONNECTION page 93.) The summer solstice triangulation point can be found in Rome by sighting down Via Fontille to S. Museo Berghese from the cen ter of the Piazza del Risorimento (moment of rise). Sighting out across the city to the tw in towers of S. Giovanni from the Piazza Risorimento locates the winter solstice triangulation point. Sighting down Via Delia Lungara from The Piazza Del Risome into to Musa Torlonia, estab lishes an angle line that is parallel to the line of sight for the rising m oon position when viewed from the obelisk at the Piazza Tieome. The Plaza Risorimento establishes the two sols tice points and the angle for the rising moon position. The observation of the rising sun on the day of the winter or summer solstice can be viewed from the Vatican. The result of the triangulation of points for observation, produces a full Shield of Christ branching out from the Vatican.

This line passes on a street in the middl e of the Forum calle d the Sacred Way. Situated in the design of the Piazza of S.

The pointer used by Martha indicates another observation that may be at a certain angle in the sky. This might be an eclipse, a bright star, or a planetary alignment. These sight lines for the moon and sun positions may have already existed before the founding of Washington, D.C. Tennessee Avenue, Maryland Avenue, Pennsylvania Avenue, Kentucky Avenue, and South Carolina Avenue are all aligned to hills in the distance, as they branch out from the Capital hill and Lincoln Park. These hills in the distance are natural landmarks that can be used for establishing points of reference. So these astronomical sight lines appear to pre-date the written \"Plan\" of Washington, D.C. This pre-existing astronomical observation sight may be attributed to Washington and his comrades, or to a pre- existing American Indian observatory known by George Washington. There is no evidence in ether case. But, the geographic landmarks of this area appears to have influenced the preferred location of the Nation's Capital for astronomical observations. Perhaps, these geographic landmarks are what captured DeGraffenried's a ttention to this region, DeGraffenreied or Washington might have been looking for a location with similar geographic features of the hills surrounding Rome.

Their location on a map in relation to the previously discussed line drawings, may hold some hidden importance. THE PARKS AND STATUES There are many parks found in Washington, D.C. Most have statues commemorating heros or events throughout American history. There are mottos and sayings associated with these parks and statues, some written in Latin, which could be a cryptic messages with hidden meaning. Some statues in these parks might have been designed as pointers to something in the distance, since arms, spears, and swords are raised in certain directions. The most interesting statue, and the one that fi rst appears out of place to American History, is the statue of Joan of Arc in Meridian Hill Park — the French woman who heard voices from the angle Michael and possibly God. In light of the possible magical uses of the Washington Pentagrams, this statue suddenly appears most appropriate. Does the statue of Joan of Arc reveal a secret about Washington, D.C? A meridian is an imaginary line the extends through the north and south pole and through a given point on the earth's surf ace. In 1804, President Thomas Jefferson established the first meridian line from the north door of the White House through north Sixteenth Street. It was customary in early days for capital cities to es tablish their own meridian line, an imaginary line from which distances to various points could be established. THE MILE STONE At the center of the Ellipse (the sign of Taurus) is the Mile Stone. This is the one point of reference in the United States from which all di stances are measured. L'Enfant's \"Plan\" called for a marker stone or \"Itinerary Column\" to be erected east of the Capital Building, but Congress chose this alternate location because it is on the meridian line that passes through the District of Columbia. The fact that this \"point of reference\" is found in the middle of the sign of Taurus may indicate another reason for its present location. The stone is a block of granite about four feet tall. The name, Zero Milestone, is carved on the north side of the marker."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"THE GROTTO - Place of rebirth The Grotto found near the Capital Building is closed to the public today, but once it was used for performing baptismal services and public drinking water.

Fi rst, in a cave used as a stall and second in a cave used for a grave. The first birth was into the material world, the second into the spirit. The location of the Grotto near the Capital corresponds to the meaning behind the Skull and Cross Bones, with the Capital Building at the point of symbolic cross over to the spiritual.

Solomon's approach to dividing the child to determining the real mother has denoted him as a wise leader of men. President Lincoln was faced with a similar decision. Lincoln had a new born nation that was divided into two fractions. His approach to uniting that nation has caused him to be known as a wise leader of men. The Scottish Rite Lodge in Washington, D.C. is symbolic of the Temple of Solomon. This Temple is symbolically represented by each Mason Lodge throughout the world. Solomon's temple is also the place where th e Knights Templar were headquartered while fighting in the Crusades. The Temple of Solom on is to be the final resting place for the Ark of the Covenant. It was built to house the Shekinah (the Presence of God). Note the similarity between the Scottish Rite Lodge and the Lincoln Memorial. Is there a reason these buildings look the same? THE OBELISK The Washington Monument is known as the worlds largest obelisk. Many of these stone structures exist around the wo rld. The original design of the obelisk came from ancient Egypt. Some of the original obelisks first discovered in Egypt have been moved to other cities in the modern world. An obelisk from Alexandria, Egypt now stands in Central Park of New York City. Its twin is erected in London, England. To most of the public, these obelisks are no more than a tourist attraction. But, it is interesting to find obelisks located in key cities of importance throughout the world. The Freemasons are responsible for bringing many of these obelisks from Egypt to their current locations. Cities around the world that have an obelisk in their city layouts include Washington, D.C, Boston, Rome, Bunno Aries, New York, London, Paris, and the Vatican. In the book Ancient Mysteries, Modern Visions it is theorized that an obelisk can act as an antenna for gathering solar energy and focusing that energy to the ground. The result being fertile ground. In theory, the pressure of the stones placed a top each other causes the Washington Monument to produce pressure upon itself. The monument acts as a piezoelectric crystal becoming electrically charged under pressure. The crystal can capture electrically energy from the sun or other energy producing objects and transfer it to the ground. Similar to the way it may discharge some radiated heat to the ground, which is stored up in the stones during the day. It is a fact that it never gets hot inside the top of the Washington Monument in the summer. This has baffled scientist for years. If not for humidifiers installed in the monument, the condensation of the humid summer Washington air would cause it to rain inside the monument. According to local folklore, there is a treasu re buried near the Washington Monument. If you walk around the base of the Washin gton Monument, you will notice a large manhole cover.

You really do not need a stone slab in a well 15 feet deep, to determine if the Washington Monument is sinking into the ground. Mentioned in chapter one, is the ancient Ameri can Indian observatory near St Louis, Mo. Dr. Warren Wittry developed many theories about the use of this site as a solar observatory for seasonal change. Dr. Wittry had to climb a top a pole fixed in the center of the site to observe the rising sun. A similar situation might exist in Washington, D.C. Though the Washington monument is not on center with the original plan and line layout of the city; it is the best vantage point for observations of the rising sun and viewing the other street symbols associated with Washington, D.C. In building the Washington Monument, stone slabs were donated from all the states, various organizations, and other countries from around the world. One stone that was donated, never made it to the monument. In 1854, the Vatican donated a block of marble from the Temple Concord in Rome to be a part of the monument. It was stolen by a secret anti- Catholic society called the \"Know-Nothings\" before it could be installed as a part of the monument. This society also seized the Monu ment Society's records in 1855. The outraged public brought a halt to the donation of funds and building materials. Congress finally approved funds to complete the monument two decades later. THE WASHINGTON STATUE - Asmodeus By the end of 1800, Washington, D.C. lacked any monument to its first President and name sake. So Congress commissioned a statue of George Washington, to be sculptured by Horatio Greenough and displayed in the city. The following is the Cleveland Leader's account of this statue which never became th e Washington Monument. It is currently on display at the Smithsonian Museum of History and Technology. \"it took eight years for Horatio Greenough to make. He did the work in Florence, Italy, where he chiseled out the Father of our Country in a sitting posture instead of standing, as the Act of Congress demanded. When the statue was completed, in 1840, the next question was how to get it from Italy to America. Congress haggled over the matter for weeks, finally sending a man-of-war to bring the statue across the Atlantic Ocean. But the marble George weighed twelve tons, and it took twenty- two yoke of oxen to haul him over the Italian roads.... When it arrived at the Washington Navy Yard, Congressmen were horrified to see that our great hero had been carved, sitting in a chair, nude to the waist. The Virginia statesman General Henr y Wise remarked at the time. 'The man does not live, and never did live, who saw Washington without his shirt.' At the Capital doors, it was found that the statue was too large... The masonry had to be cut away and the door enlarged. When it was finally installed the Rotunda floor began to sink, so a pedestal was built under it to support it. It was soon decided that the Rotu nda was not the suitable place for the statue, and at last, after a number of removals, it was taken for display in the bitter cold, bleak air of the Capital plateau...\""},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"70 The Mysterious Landmarks The most interesting thing about this statue is the strange way in which George Washington was'depicted.

The Washington Statue was first displayed, and was intended to be permanently displayed, in the center of the Rotunda. When the Washington statue is situated at the center of the Rotunda, it is centered be tween the lunar cycle observance discussed earlier.

But, there are some street s that converge at very unusual locations. North Carolina and South Carolina Avenues converge across from the center of the East Potomac Park Country Club.

C. produce mo re questions than they do answers. Why draw symbols on the ground that can only be seen from the air? Who was suppose to see these symbols in an age of little or any air travel? Who has expanded upon the original design with additional symbols? What groups or organizations use these symbols? The answers are not what most people would associate with a democratic government. The hot air balloon did exist in 1792. According to a local Washington newspaper, the first hot air balloon flight in the Unite d States took place in Washington, D.C. We have already discussed the possibility of these symbols being used to communicate with spirits or forces from the spirit world. Most interesting are stories about George Washington considered to be traditional American folklore. One states that Washington received a vision at Valley Forge in which an \"angel\" showed him the future of America. Another story tells how an old Indian medicine man believed that the Great Spirit protected and guided Washington's footsteps and that Washington would become the chief of many nations. Was George Washington and the destiny of the United Stated guided by supernatural forces? Are the street symbols of Washington, D.C, as explained by the laws of magic, a way of communicating with these su pernatural forces for guidance? Maybe someone other than a human was suppose to view these symbols. This leads to a strong connection between the symbols and some sort of Divine Overseer. Of course the symbols can be viewed from the Washington Monument and this could be a chief reason it was designed as a building, instead of a sold obelisk. But, the Washington Monument was not finished at the origin al conception of the city. Possibly the symbols are not so much to be vi ewed, as they are to be walked upon. Both the hexagram star and the pentagram stars are ritual paths, used in the occult arts for invoking and banishing spirits and demons. The paths used in these ceremonies are laid out on the same north-south and east-west axis as the street symbols of Washington, DC. Further, these paths are accompanied by other sy mbols that determine the specific sprints or demons being invoked of banished. The star symbols of the Washington Line Complex have these same associated symbols found near them. The evidence is clear. The star shapes are not just symbolic drawings to be observed, but also ceremonial paths used by someone participating in the act of invoking or banishing spirits."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"More Questions Th an Answers 75 THE DEATH OF GEORGE WASHINGTON When you visit Mount Vernon on a guided tour, the homestead of George Washington, you can hear a very interesting story about his death.

Doctors treated Washington by bleeding him four times to remove the evil spirits thought to cause the disease, along with gargles of molasses, vinegar, and butter.

Clearly, L'Enfant is not the sole originator of the \"Plan.\" Perhaps the Freemasons of the eighteen th century are the de velopers of all the Washington lines and symbols. The Square and Compass alone appears to be enough to point the finger at Masons, just as the Star of David and Sephirot appear to be enough to point the finger at the Jews, as the possible developers of the Washington lines. Even the pentagrams provide evidence for an eighteenth century witch hunt. But, finding the who is a much deeper search. FREEMASONRY Masons were surely involved in the centr al development of the United States. Most Masons today can take pride in the fact that their special brotherhood had much to do with the establishment of the United States of America, when it came to developing an organized military force around the thirteen separate colonies. It is well know that Washington made many visits to the various state lodges preceding the Revolutionary War, looking for support from his fellow lodge members. George Washington called on his Mason comrades in establishing the first adhesive resistance to the British government. If it had not been for Freemasonry in the early 1700s, then perhaps the Revolution would not have taken place. Not because Masons lead the movement, but becau se the Mason lodge structure of that time allowed for the implementation of free thought for the development of an organized military. But, did Washington use the Masons of the eighteenth century to help establish this country for the good of the public, or for the good of someone else? Are the Square and Compass and other symbols exclusive to Freemasonry? Were these symbols established only to praise the efforts of Freema sonry in the establishment of the United States, or to praise something else? Freemasonry in 1791, as it is today, appears to be more of a social organization than a political order. It is reasonable to think that many of its members were not aware of the organization's political influences in the 1700s. If this was not so, then surely our current history books would have placed Freemasonry as a political force in America in the late eighteenth century. Publicity was not their way to a means, but rather secrecy and organization around certain beliefs. The key thing to remember about Freemasonry is that it was an International Organization in the 1700s, not just an Am erican Organization. In the eighteenth century, the main governing bodies of Freemasonry were in Scotland, France, and England. The man taking credit for planning Washington, D.C. was a Frenchman. It is ironic to think that the rebellious colonies that separated themselves from England, were developed around the beliefs of Freemason supporters with mother lodges from England and Scotland. So if Washington,"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"The Who 77 D.C. was laid out to perform some sort of Freemasonry function or to commemorate this organization, then it commemorates an International Organization. Perhaps the forces that underline Freemasonry may lead us to other important factors in the establishment of the Washington Street Lines. There are other organizations associated with Freemasonry that were started outside the Unit ed States. Both Washington and Jefferson have been linked to many of these organizations. TEMPLE OF THE SCOTTISH RITE At 1733 16th Street N.W., at S. Street s its the Temple of the Scottish Rite Supreme Council. The temple museum houses the largest collection of relics of Freemasonry in the world. The upper grades of initiation of the Sc ottish Rite Order of Fr eemasonry are considered to be the lower degrees of the Prieure de Sion initiation. THE ARMS OF THE FREEMASONRY Like all coats of arms, the Arms of Freemasons illustrates in symbols the principles behind their Order. The double eagle is the symbol of the Scottish Rite. The official portrait of George Washington displayed at the White House shows the double eagle on the leg of the table next to Washington. The same double eagle can be found on the flag in a second portrait of Washington. This tends to confirm George Washington's affiliation with Freemasonry, especially the Scottish Rite.

These being: 1. Professional building guilds and craftsman. 2. Secret groups studying the philosophy of life. The first provides the form of the organization and the second provides the theory. Even today, Freemasons are the working class holding to key principles that produce a fruitful life. In tracing the roots of Freemasonry, we can find its past in many of the following organizations. Though Freemasonry is not a continuation of the these other select Orders, it appears Freemasonry has adopted many of the same rituals and symbols associated with them. Masonry appears to be more of a copycat than an originator. Thus, if the Washington Line Complex was produced to symbolize Freemasonry, then it also represents the values of many other secret societies. THE SOCIETY OF CINCINNAT I - The American Royal We mentioned this society before as one thing that Washington and L'Enfant had in common. Remember, it was L'Enfant's ability to develop symbolic meaning for the Society of Cincinnati's insignia that captured George Washington's attention. It is possible that Washington was working especially for the good of this society in the layout of Washington, D.C. What is known about the Society of Cincinnati? The Society of Cincinnati was an associati on of American and French officers from the army after it disbanded in 1780. Membership in the organization was passed onto the eldest male descendants. Thus, membership was by heredity. The society was not well-taken by many states who saw a new American Royal read y to be formed. Many states prevented civil offices from being held by anyone who was a member of this organization. Remember, the designers of Washington, D.C. were members of this organization. George Washington, president for life of this society, began receiving complains about the way membership was established. So he withdrew all claims of its members to any hereditary distinctions."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"82 The Who It appears that Washington silenced the public by this act, but the fact that both Washington and L'Enfant were members of th is organization questions the private social function of the Order, since Washington chose a fellow comrade for public works. Washington did not disband the society by removing the rights of membership to the original member's heirs. This private society is still in existence today, with many of its honored members being the blood relatives of the American and French patriots who fought in the American Revolutionary War. Many of its members in a true sense appear to be the America Royal, the self-appointed few who have passed on their personage to their heirs in the United States. HOUSE OF THE SOCIETY OF CINCINNATI At 2118 Massachusetts Avenue N.W. is one of Washington's last great mansions, the Lars Anderson house. It is the location of the museum for the Society of the Cincinnati. The museum contains a collection of artifacts and a reference library on the Revolutionary War. THE ILLUMINATI On May 1, 1776 Adam Weishaupt, a professor of law at Ingolstadt University at Dresden, Germany, founded the Barvarian Illuminati. Th e main objective of this organization was to remove all heads of state. Some scholars believed that Weishaupt's group was a part of a larger organization. The Illuminist supposedly do not exist today, but it has been linked to the John Birch Society. When it did exist, it consisted of three classes: Novice, Fr eemason or Scottish, and Mystery. The Freemason class links the Illumina ti to Masonry. It was even believed that the Illuminati had spread across America through its association with Masonry at the end of the eighteenth century. Its central function of removing all heads of state, links it to the Prieure de Sion and Knights of Templars groups found in France. Both organizations had as part of their creeds, the overthrow of heads of state. The word \"illuminati\" refers to one who is enlighten by receiving knowledge from a higher source. The term is used by the Gnostics, Rosicrucians, and Mystery Schools of the Middle East. THE GOLDEN DAWN This Order was started much later than Freema sonry. None of the founding fathers appear to have been directly associated with this ma gical group, though they were associated with the Rosicrucians of which the Golden Dawn is a branch. The Golden Dawn is still in existence today, as a Hermetic Order that has adopted many principles from all types of magic to develop a universal system of magic. The book The Golden Dawn, by Israel Regardie is an excellent source of information on rituals asso ciated with traditional magic, which can be applied to the streets symbols of Washington, D.C."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"The Who 83 THE ROSICRUCIANS The Rosicrucians are a mystic learned society believing in the principles of Christianity. They appear to have adopted principles from the Kabbalist movement in the development of their philosophies. The mysteries and secrets of the Knights Templars were believed to be handed to the Rosicrucians. The Order may well be an off shoot of the Templars. The Rosicrucians adopted not only Kabbalist and Templar theology, but ancient Egyptian principles to develop their own philosophy established around traditional Christianity. The word \"Rose-Croix\" or \"Rose-Cross\" is associated with the rose beetle, better known as the Egyptian scarab. The Egyptian scarab is symbo lic of rebirth. Rose also means \"dew\" and cross can be translated to mean \"light.\" This translation would mean \"dew light\" or \"morning light.\" Members of the organization try not to be known as members. Everything is kept a secret in relation to their aims, doctrines, and system. Both George Washington and Thomas Jefferson have been linked as members of this organization. THE KNIGHTS TEMPLARS This organization is known as the brotherhood who protected the pilgrims on the roads to Jerusalem from looters during the Crusades. They adopted the stables of the Temple of Solomon as their base of operation and the Order was sanctioned by the Council of Troyes and by the Pope. According to legend, the Templa rs found the Treasure of Solomon while in Jerusalem or in Rome, and this treasure allowe d the Order to become rich and powerful. In the end, the Templars were accused of denying Je sus as the Christ and of using black magic, by the Catholic Church and the French King. It was disbanded with many of its members put to death. They are linked to Johnannism, which believes that John the Baptist was the true Christ. The Templars worshiped a mysterious head called Baphomet. The word Baphomet is derived from the Greek words signifying baptism of wisdom or knowledge. The fact that Baphomet is symbolized by the head of a goat or ram indicates the possibility that this knowledge might have something to do with the constellation Aries. The Templars were an international organization and possibly the only international organization that offered opposition to the Catholic Church. Their members were known as capitalist. International banking, as it exist today, can be traced back to the Knights Templars. These two things made the Templars an enemy of both the Catholic Church and the Monarchy, which worried that the Templars could threaten their positions. At 3101 R Street N.W. in Washington, D.C. is Dunbarton Oaks. This is the mansion used for a World War II conference that led to the establishment of the current World Bank. THE PRIEURE DE SION As discussed earlier, this group might have been the mother group for the Knights Templars, the Rosicrucians, and the Freemasons. The chief function of the Prieure de Sion, according to the book Holy Blood, Holy Grail, is to protect a religious secret of some sort (a possible material or spiritual treasure.) This organization is believed to have started in Troye."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"84 The Who France. Troye was a center of Cathar and Kabba list learning in the twelfth century. So the Prieure de Sion is a possible off-shoot of these two older groups. There is a link of the Barvaria n Illuminati to the Prieure de Sion. A secret document that surfaced in the 1920s called \"The 'Protocols' of th e Elders of Zion\" indicated the existence of a secret society bent on a world revolution from within governments. A good example of the \"Protocols\" in practice is the overnight change of hands of the Communist Block in 1989. The \"Protocols\" have been linked to Freemasonry, Jewish Zionisist, Communism, and International Banking. The book Holy Blood, Holy Grail convincingly links the \"Protocols\" to the Prieure de Sion. THE CATHARS - PRIMITIVE CHURCH - GNOSTICS - JOHANNITES The Primitive Church was an early form of Christianity that followed the doctrine of St. John, the supposed writer of the fourth New Te stament Gospel. The Johannites are considered to be an adjacent movement at the time of the Primitive Church. Both worshiped based on the theologies closely associated with metaphysics and the Christian Gnostics. The Christian Gnostics believed in a dualist theology based on light and dark. Possibly it is the same light and dark mentioned in the Gospel of John. The Cathars of Southern France appear to have adopted their beliefs from these early Christian Gnostic sects. For the Cathars and the Gnostics, the material world was ruled by the devil and the spirit world ruled by God. The Cathars concluded that since Jesus was of the material world, he must be a devil. God was much too aspiring to reduce himself to be a part of the material existence. This was in direct contradiction with the Catholic Church, which claims to be God's representative on Earth. The Nag Hammadi Scrolls display much of what is known about the early Christian Gnostics beliefs. The Cathars were known to possess a great tr easure, linked to the treasure stolen from Jerusalem and taken to Rome by Titus in AD 70. Some believe this treasure was passed from the Cathars of Southern France to the Templars. THE JEWISH MYSTICS - and the KABBALLA The Jewish faith can be divided into two distinct groups - the Orthodox and the Mystic. The Mystic is a secret Order based on an allegorical interpretation of the Tora through numbers and metaphysics. The Orthodox view is a public historical written interpretation. The Mystic view is kept secret, with its doctri ne handed down word of mouth to initiates in the religion. There are several Mystic Jewish Orders, with the Kabbalist being one of these. The Kabbalist followed the oral teachings from the Sepher Yetzirah, or Book or Creation, and the Sepher-Ha-Zohar, or Book of Light (Book of Radiance.) These two oral books were written down as the Zohar in the thirteenth cent ury by a Spanish Jew, Moses de Leon. It is believed the teachings in the popular Zohar were spread to the Cathars of Southern France and later adopted by the other secret societies discussed earlier."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"The Who 85 THE JEWISH ESSEANS - THE SUNRISE SERVICE Another mystic Jewish Order, just recently being understood because of information found in the Dead Sea Scrolls, is the Esseans or Essaei . This was a sect of Jews that existed at the time of Jesus Christ, as recorded in the four Gospels. Little appears to be known about them until after the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls. It is believed by many religious scholars that the historical Jesus and John the Baptist were possible Essean masters or high priests. According to the Jewish historian Josephus , the Esseans greeted the morning sun with reverence and carried out rituals for its rising. It appears the Esseans would feel right at home if they were living in Washington, D.C. The Esseans can be traced to a Jewish co mmunity at the monastery at Qumran. The location of this community was at or near modern day Alexandria, Egypt. (South of Washington, D.C. is the city of Alexandria, Virginia.) This Order appears linked to even older Egyptian religions involved in the sun worship of the Isis-Osiris Cult. The principal of sun worship may really hold so me scientific merit. Scientist have recently discovered that humans have an internal cloc k that works in sync with the sun. Cancer patients taking drugs at certain times of the day, when their internal clock is in sync with the daylight hours, have a significant increase in recovery. A whole new science dealing with the effects of the light of the sun on the human internal clock has just started for modern day medicine. Thus our time line that associates one secr et society to the next , appears as follows: 1. A secret group of colonist from the thirteen states used Freemasons to organize a military to overthrow the King of England. 2. Freemasonry is an International Order associ ated with other secret societies - the Rosicrucians, the Templars, and the Kabbalist. 3. The Rosicrucians, Templars, and Kabbalist can be associated with ancient forms of early Christianity and the Pieure de Sion. 4. These early forms of Christianity are associated with Jewish Mysticism and Egyptian religions. 5. These early forms of Jewish Mysticism and Eg yptian religions are asso ciated with ancient sun worshipping. 6. Sun worshipping is associated with many ancient temples, line drawings, and megalithic sites. 7. What goes around comes around — many ancient archaeological sites around the world and the streets of Washington, D.C. are aligned to the movement of the sun, the moon, and the stars. Who is responsible for the mysterious street lines of Washington, D.C? Is it a single person like L'Enfant or the belief system of an ancient religion or secret society? What is the purpose of the street lines and symbols? Ar e they symbols associat ed with an ancient philosophy or an ancient ritual? Or could th e streets of Washington, D.C. really be a directional marker to a hidden treasure?"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Chapter 7 A TREASURE MAP- THE LOST TREASURE OF KING SOLOMON THE ARK OF THE COVENANT AND THE HOLY GRAIL Located in France is the country town of Rennes-le-Chateau. Legends are deep in the history of this French community. The town is in the heart of the old Knights of the Templars and Cathar communities of southern France. One of the famous legends surrounding this town is of a buried treasure, possibly the fabled lost treasure of King Solomon including the Ark of the Covenant or the Holy Grail, believed to have been removed by the Templars at the time of the Crusades. As the legend goes, the Knights hid the treasure after the Inquisitions in which De-Molay, their l eader, was burned at the stake by the King of France. In 1892 a 33 year old priest, Francois-Berenger-Suniere of the church of Sainte-Madeleine in Rennes-le-Chateau, discovered manuscripts believe d to lead to a hidden treasure while restoring the church. He took these manuscripts to Paris in January 1893, where they were sold. There is some speculation by historians that the Vatican was the purchaser. Copies of these documents have survived. They appear to be nothing more than New Testament passages, written in Latin script. The first parchment is (John 12:1-12) and the second is the story of the disciples plucking ears of corn on the Sabbath, as described from Matthew (12:1-8), Mark (2:23-28), and Luke (6:1-5). Bu t, a cryptic message appears to have been placed in the documents. Monograms, additional letters, letters marked with dots, and displaced letters have yielded to a decipherment by cryptographers. It is known that the Knight Templars worshiped a mysterious head, believed to be the goat head Baphomet (or Asmodeus guardian of the Treasure of King Solomon) based around the pentagram design. In deciphering the manuscripts, clues for finding a statue of Asmodeus at the Rennes-le-Cheateau church was uncovered. Below the statue is written, \"Par ce signe tu le vaincra.\" The words translate to \"I n this sign shalt thou conquer.\" Treasure hunters in this area of France have ev en established a pentagram laid out between key landmarks in the countryside near Rennes-le-Chateau - the \"Pentagram of Rennes-le- Chateau.\" The landmarks were found by deciph ering the cryptic text in the manuscripts discovered by Berenger-Suniere. In the near center of this pentagram was a stone marker, the Coume-Sourde stone, with what appears to be an engraved map and a cryptic clue to the possible location of this legendary treasure of the Knights Templar. The Latin phrase on the stone translates \"In the middle of th e line where M cuts the lesser line.\""},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"The Treasure Map 87 Trying to decode this map, when applied to the countryside of Rennes-le-Chateau, has proven fruitless, with no treasure being found.

One clue on the stone is the \"P-S\" which is believed to stand for the Masonic Order of \"le Prieure de Sion\" originating from this region of France. The triangle shape or spear poi nt on the stone is often called the \"Sign of the Prieure de Sion.\" One common translation of the word \"prieure\" is rock, another is prayer, since \"priere\" in French means prayer. So, this stone may be the legendary \"Rock of Sion\" or the \"Prayer of Sion.\" With Sion be ing translated as mean ing heaven, the meaning of Prieure de Sion could be \"Prayer from Heaven\" or \"Voice from Heaven.\" Did this Masonic Order possibly take char ge of a treasure from the Templars, the Rosicrucians, or the Freemasons? Could the \"M\" spoken of in the cryptic clue, lead to the possible location of a hidden treasure? Treas ure hunters of Rennes-le-Chateau believed it possibly means the location of Marie Negri d' Ables's grave marker. The missing marker, in addition to the hard to follow terrain of this re gion of France, has yielded no treasure. But, this \"M\" might mean something else, if applied to three other large pentagrams located nearly 2000 miles away in the st reets of Washington, D.C. LOCATION ONE The streets running in the north-south and east-west direction in Washington, D.C. are numbered and lettered respectfully, based on the designs of L'Enfant. There are two streets named after each letter of the alphabet, except J and B. Were these two letters left out to position other letters to certain street locations? There is a North M Street and a South M Str eet in Washington, D. C. North M Street passes through the Small Pentagram associated with the White House. It also intersects an apparent non-important a ngled street line at its center near Ward Place. Not to far from this location is Sumter Inn.

The \"M\" may mark a point on the stone map where another line intersects at that real location. The same point can be found on the Capital Pentagram (also the Asmodeus Pentagram or Baphomet Pentagram). Note the actual street s of Washington that creates the Capital Pentagram, looks exactly like the drawing on the Coume-Sourde stone - the Sign of Prieure de Sion. These lines form the Spear Point or Shield of Christ, as previously discussed. There is a point where South Carolina Street passes over the same short line as the \"M\" on the Coume-Sourde stone, this being Kentucky Avenue.

This researcher ha s used the principles of illumination in finding many of the clues for the interpretation of the symbols in the streets of Washington, D.C. Illumination was commonly used to transfer information to the masses before the wide spread use of printing, since most people before 1800 were not formally educated to read or write. It also makes use of pictures as a universal means of communicating an idea to people of different languages and cultures. This researcher has uncovered as many as 277 paintings, sculptures, buildings, and other city plans from around the world that illuminate the importance of the Washington symbols. The modern day approach of illumination is through film. It appears the secret of Washington, D.C. is not a secret to certain individuals in the motion picture industry. It also appears that these individuals are willing to le t the public in on it, if they are illuminated. A few dozen motion pictures released in the past two decades illuminates clues to the mystery behind the streets of Washington, D.C. Usi ng the slow motion control on your VCR while viewing such films as \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" and \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" is an excellent first exercise in illumination that will produce some surprising results related to Washington, D.C.

As might be expected, the \"Shield of Christ\" is also laid out in the streets of Rome. An understanding of this symbol in Rome, may shed some light on the same shapes in Washington, D.C.

Sighting from the center of St. Peter's Basilica to S. Giovanni establishes a vi ew of the rising sun on the day of the winter solstice for Rome. The mysterious \"M\" position can be found at S. Maria Maggiore for producing a line of sight across the city. This line of sight intersects the otner moon line branching out from Plaza Riseginento to the Musa Torlonia. Halfway between S. Marie Maggiore and S. Manain Trastey is a point ju st behind the Mounumento Vitt. Eman. II.

This is the \"key\" to decoding th e picture map. Look for the crosses. There are crosses on the tops of obelisks and near certain buildings in the picture map.

Connecting the Xs near the buildings yields the Shield of Christ, or Spear Point, with the \"M\" position located. Connecting key buildings and landmarks draws out the giant Pentagram of Rome. Figures in the picture also offer clues to decoding the hidden meaning. St. Peter holds the key. Jesus is near the winter solstice position of the sun.

It appears the Roman Catholic Church holds certain secret astronomical information related to the pos itions of the sun and moon of great religious importance.

Surprisingly, the traditional past enemies of the Roman Catholic Church, the prac ticers of magic, the occult arts , the Cathars, the Kabbalist, the Knights Templars, the Esseans, the Rosicr ucians, the Freemasons, and Wicca also hold the exact same astronomical information in great esteem. In relation to the doctrine of the Catholic Chur ch, there is the strong implication that the Roman Catholic tradition is based, in part, on the principles of astronomy and astrology used by the early Romans. The Vatican was built on the location of the ancient Circus, an already existing astronomical observation sight that predates any gospel accounts of St. Peter and even Jesus. Is this information related to the Vatican, th e secret Berenger Sauniere discovered at Rennes- le-Chateau? Did the Vatican pay him off not to reveal it to the world because of the implications for the Catholic Church and modem day Christianity? Are the Cathars, which the Catholics put to death during the Inquisitions, the founding fathers of modern day Catholicism?

Almost four thousand years ago the precession of th e equinox changed the rising sun to the center of Aries. It is now in the constellation Pisces. The Romans understood this change in positions of the constellations, as shown in the following frieze from an early Roman building. Taurus the bull, Aries the ram, and the Boar replaces Pieces on the Roman Zodiac The Vatican compass legs are made up of two streets pointing to the equinox position of true east. These streets are called Borgo Nuovo or Borgo New and Borgo Vecchio or Borgo Cow — New Cow. Four thousand years ago Taurus was due east, but the alignment changed about 3666 years ago making Aries the \"New Cow.\" The constellation's position had changed signaling the start of the second 2166 year period based on Aries. There appears to be some astronomical event that possibly comes out of Aries that has an implication to the age of Pisces that can be viewed or triangulated from the sight line passing through S. Marrie Magiore to Novatiani. This might be an astronomical observance such as a bright star, a comet, a planetary alignment, or a nova, seen in the ea st at the beginning of the age of Aries or from the northeast at the be ginning of the age of Pisces. It might signify the fabled bright star in the east that lead the magi to Bethlehem. Or it might represent the normal location of the sun at the center of th e celestial equator on the day of the equinox.

The Ark is the Holy Relic used by the Israelites to communicate with God. It was carried before their armies in battle as a talisman for defeating their enemies. It was believed to be stored in a hidden room beneath the Temple of Solomon and was stolen by the Romans in AD 70, when Titus ransacked Jerusalem. The rough dimensions of the Ark is 45 inches long and 27 inches in width and height. It is a box lined with gold, covered with a gold mercy seat, and surrounded by two Cherubrims. It ma y be a heavy object, since it must be carried by two men. According to the Bible, the Ark contained the broken tablets of the laws given to Moses. But, religious tradition indicates the Ark contains the presence of Yahweh, the Hebrew God. It has been held that it stores the bones of Joseph, as well as stone fetishes (meteoric stones from heaven) from Yahweh's abode on Horeb or Sinai. Somehow the Templars may have gained control of the Ark during the Crusades, and it might have been a part of their treasure. One possible location of the Ark is Ethiopia. It is the tradition of the Ethiopian church that the Ark was moved from Jerusalem before the destruction of the Temple. Menelik the child of Solomon and Sheba took the Ark and carried it to modern day Ethiopia. It is believed to be hidden in the cathedral at Aksum and remains a central part of religious practices today. Known as the Tobat (from Arabic tabut 'al 'ahdi, the Ark of the Covenant). A copy of it is carried in procession through the streets at the festival of Epip hany. Copies of the Tabot are also kept in every church in Ethiopia. According to the book The Ultimate Frontier by Kieninger, the Ark was originally stored in the Kings Chamber of the Great Pyramid. The Ark is a real object that symbolizes the salvation through Christ. It is currently held in the possession of one of the secret brotherhoods. The most wildly held historical account of the Ark and the treasure of King Solomon is that it was taken to Rome in AD 70. Benjenajim of Tudela believed that Titus \"kept the Ark in a cave near the Church of St. Sebastian.\" Most Roman historians believe it was kept at the Temple of Peace, in the part called the Temp le Vespasian. According to one account, the Menorah (the Jewish candelabra) was dropped into the Tiber from the Milvian Bridge while Maxentius was fleeing from the invasion of Constantine in AD 312. If the Ark of the Covenant and the Treasure of Solomon were stored in the Temple Vespasian at Rome, then we have a clue to what was at the center of that non-important line in Rome. Laying out the Shield of Christ over the ancient Forum of Rome, locates the Temple Vespasian at the center of that non-important line. \"In the middle of the line where M cuts the lesser line.\" "},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"The Treasure Map 103 THE JERUSALEM CONNECTION - LOCATION SEVEN If the layout of the \"Shield of Christ\" is somehow associated with the Ark taken by Titus back to Rome after he sacked Jerusalem in AD 70, then it stands to reason that the same layout might exist in the city plan of Jerusa lem for the same astronomical observance. What is expect appears to be true, with the center of that non-important line locating the site where the Ark of the Covenant was once displayed. Jerusalem is a city of domes and towers. These are landmarks situated in the city, as well on hill tops outside the city. The east-west axis line runs through the Lion's Gate (on older maps it is called the East Gate) to hill 692 meters high, east of the city. The moon sight line runs from a hill 759 meters high, through the Ea st Gate, to church towers outside the city. The winter solstice sight line runs from Notre Dame, through the Holy Sepulchre, through the Wailing Wall, through the Pinnacle of the Temple of Solomon. The layout produces the Half-Shield of Christ. A sight line from Dormition Abbey (the location of the Last Supper, of the resurrection appearances. Tomb of David, Tomb of Solomon, and the death of Mary) to a hill 746 meters high just north on the Mount of Olives, passes through the Dome of the Rock and the Wailing Wall. A line drawn from the Tower of David, through the Dome of the Rock, through the Golden Gate, through Gethsemane, locates the Mount of Olives. The Dome of the Rock, built on the sight of Solomon's Temple, is in the middle of the sight line from the Cathedral of St. George to the Mount of Ascension. It is also in the middle of the sight line from Dormition Abbey (Church of St Mary's) to the peak north of the Mount of Olives. \"In the middle of th e line where M cuts the lesser line.\" A sight line due east of the Holy Sepulchre will past through the Golden Gate. It should be noted that the Holy Sepulchre and many of the buildings of Jerusalem, as a related points of reference, were build by Constantine, who al so built St. Peter's in Rome. It is hard to determine if the \"Shield of Christ Layout\" is coming to Jerusalem from Rome, or visa versa. Older maps pre-dating the time of Jesus, indicat es these sight lines were in existence, with only the names and type of landmarks changing. Perhaps another clue to the \"Shi eld of Christ Layout\" is the cr escent moon that sits a top of the Doom of the Rock. Another might be the Mount of Olives (or Olivet) northeast of Jerusalem, since Mount Olivet Cemetery is located northeast of Washington, D.C. But, the real reference to an astronomical obs ervation is designed around the Holy Sepulchre of Constantine. The building is in the shape of a giant refraction telescope. If the building was a tube and lens and mirrors were placed at key locations in the building plan, a common day astronomical tool could be constructed. Sir Norman Lockyer developed theories about ancient temples at the compound of Karnak in Egypt. He determined that they were aligned to the position of the rising sun and rising stars on certain days. The temples were designed to narrow a beam of light penetrating along the axis to a sanctuary. The longer the temple the smaller the point of light, establishing a more exact measurement of time for the rise of the star or sun. This same principle applies to the Holy Sepulchre. It may also apply to the Forum temples of Roman, and the Vatican."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"104 The Treasure Map "},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"The Treasure Map 105 "},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"106 The Treasure Map "},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"The Treasure Map 107 By connecting lines to other landmarks around the city, the Giant Pentagram of Jerusalem can be established.

In Christian folklore, the Grail is consid ered to be a Jasper Vessel contained within a bowl of a large Silver Chalice, which was given to Abraham by the mysterious figure Melchizedek. Later it came into the hands of Joseph of Arimathea in who's Upper Room the Last Supper took place. This same chalice was used to catch the blood of Christ at the crucifixion. But, most scholars agree the Grail romances have something to do with the cycles of the seasons, with the death and rebirth of the year. Yet, Wolfram Von Eschenbach in his version of Persivel, possible the most accurate of the Grail romances, tells us the Grail is a stone. \"If he gazed at the Stone for two hundred years His beard would not turn gray Such force gives the stone to man That his flesh and bones Promptly become young again And the stone is called the Grail.\" Is this Grail stone the Coume-Sourde stone in the Rennes-le-Chateau pentagram? During World War II the Nazis Occult Bureau actually carried out extensive excavations in southern France near Rennes-le-Chateau for the Grail. In the book Spear of Destiny, Trevor Ravenscrof t offers evidence that the stone Grail was a stone spear. It was possibly the Spear of Longinus , used to pierce the side of Christ. This book documents the owners of th e spear and their use of it fo r world conquest. Hitler may have viewed this spear to be the Grail, but probably not since his army went digging for something else, after he had cl aimed possession of the Spear of Longinus before World War II from the Treasure House of Hofburg in Vienna. Th ere is a legend associated with the fabled Spear of Longinus - that whoever claims it, a nd solves its secrets, holds the destiny of the world in his hands for good or evil. Accordi ng to legend, Joseph of Arimathea's daughter married the son of the Roman soldier Longinus and their offspring were the ancestry of the royal family of England. In his book The Shroud and The Grail, Noel Curre r-Briggs implies that the Grail is a platter or shield shaped object. The lower Latin word for Grail is \"gradlla\" meaning \"shield.\" Is the Grail possibly a Holy Shield? The word Grail is taken from the root word \"g radual,\" so the Grail could mean a gradual, step by step, degree by degree, movement to that most holy. Just as the sephirot tree is a ladder to the universal creator. The Grail may be a path to higher consciousness serving the same function as the sephirot tree. \"The Sun a nd the Crescent Moon, rightly oriented in the sky, are the sign of the Grail, the Holy Symbol of Transcendental Consciousness. The Incarnation of Christ into the body and blood of human Jesus was the descent of the Sun Spirit into the Moon Chalice, the configuration which became the symbol of the Holy Grail in the Middle Ages.\" 4 The references to the sun and moon may not be al legorical, but rather references to the real physical locations of the sun and moon at a ti me and a place- a possible eclipse. Could such"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"112 The Treasure Map a location be observed through the alignment from one of the street lines of Washington, D.C.? An observation of the crescent moon, bl ood red on a silver challis, rising from Aries in the eastern sky, might be the reference. The book Holy Blood, Holy Grail makes a case for a possible holy linage. This book concludes the Grail was not a sephirot tree, but a family tree waiting to bring forth the second coming of Christ. If the book Holy Blood, Holy Grail is correct in its hypothesis (that the Prieure de Sion is guarding a blood line, possibly that of Jesus Christ or the decedents of David), then we have something that ties the Society of Cincinnati to the Prieure de Sion, besides the White House Pentagram and White House \"Shield of Christ.\" Both societies are based on the passage of a blood line. Is it possible that the Society of Cincinnati is protecting a specific blood line, and the passing on of membership through heredity is just a front? If so, is this the same blood line being protected by the Prieure de Sion? Might this be the most valuable treasure of all? There are other references to other objects in the Grail Romances that bare strange resemblances to Washington, D.C. There is the Grail Castle where the Grail is stored, which is built on the top of a mountain. Access to th e castle is by a narrow bridge. At the center of the castle, according to the Dur Jungere Titura l by Scharffenberg, is a room with a dome with three entrances. The dome gives the view of a clock work made up of the sun and the moon with a model of the structure in miniature situated on the floor at the center of the dome. Within this model is kept the Grail. Is there something hidden in the model of the Capital Building in the Crypt Room beneath the floor of the Capital Rotunda? What is the size of the empty coffer in the Crypt tomb? Or is the Grail located in the model of the Vatican inside St. Peter's Basilica? Is the Coume-Sourde stone with the spear point drawing really the Holy Grail? Does the spear point drawn on the Coume-Sourde stone and in the streets of Washington, D.C. have something to do with the legend behind the Grail and the Spear of Longinus? Are the markings on the stone, in the shape of a spear, just a coincide nce? Is it a coincidence that these markings on the Coume-Sourde stone universally represents the limits of the movement for the sun and moon? Is it a coincidence th at the Coume-Sourde stone markings also represent the Shield of Christ? It is a coincidence that this Shield of Christ symbol locates the Temple where Titus stored the treasure of Solomon, including the Ark of the Covenant? Is it a coincidence that the non-important line pierces the side of the Shield of Christ? It is a coincidence that these things relate to the Pyramids of Giza, Jerusalem, Rome, and the Vatican? Is it a coincidence that the Ark is disp layed on the Freemasonry coat of arms? Is it just a coincidence that all of these things relate to Washington, D.C? May this treasure be found to all who are illuminated."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"The Treasure Map 113 THE EVENTS IN THE EAST The symbols and layouts of Washington, D.C., Rome, and Jerusalem appear to have esoteric meaning. But, the fact that they relate to the actual locations of the sun, moon, and stars, indicates a factual reason for their existe nce. There appears to be a certain astronomical event that is being expressed by the symbols. What is this astronomical event that is so important that someone has laid it out, on a grand scale, in major cities of the world and associated it with God? STARS, COMETS, AND PLANETS The Bible speaks of the star in the east that lead the magi to the Messiah. The magi are generally considered to be early astronomers. Did they keep a record of this astronomical event to signify a possible Second Coming? Did this record somehow pass into the hands of the Catholic Church and the secret societies? Wa s this star of Bethlehem a comet, a nova, or an alignment of the planets? All historical astronomical records ag ree, there is no known astronomical event that occurred at the time of the birth of Jesus, as recorded in the four Gospels. This has forced many Gospel scholars to question the historical accuracy of the four Gospels. But, the non-important line, crossing the Shield of Christ, does sight a constellation at the time of his recorded birth. David Ritchie, in his book Comets The Swords of Heaven, uses ancient scriptures from the Bible and other religions to show that comets or asteroids have hit the earth in the past 3000 years which produced natural disasters. Many of these travelers of our solar system have orbits that are as predictable as the rise and fall of the sun and moon. Is there a certain comet or asteroid that will someday intersect with the earth's orbit? A Russian astronomer, Velikovsky, developed many theories about the planets in his book World in Collisions. Most of his theories are not readily accepted by astronomers. One theory is associated with the planet Venus. He claims that Venus was once a comet caught by the gravitational pull of the sun. This event happened nearly 3500 years ago around 1500 B.C. Its close proximity to the earth caused global destruction, including great floods, as recorded by all ancient civilizations. Is it possible that early civilizations witnessing this event, associated it with a new bom God? According to the books 5/5/2000 ICE: THE ULTIMATE DISASTER by Richard Noone and We Are The Earthquake Generation by Dr. Jeffery Goodman, a planetary alignment with the sun and earth will occur on May 5th, 2000, which has not happened for nearly 6000 years. Based on the earth's location on the celestial equato r, this event will appear as a very bright light in the northeastern sky consisting of the planets Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, and Mercury. The book 5/5/2000 concludes a possible world disaster when the gravitational pull of this unusual conjunction of the planets, causes great earthquakes, tidal waves, and possibly a shift in the polar axis. Not mentioned in these books is the fact that the Roman Forum has the temples of Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, and the Field of Mars all on the same line of axis of the winter solstice, along the Sacred Way. It is possible that the mystery lines of Washington, D.C. are a warning of a future global disaster?"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"114 The Treasure Map WHERE IS THIS EVENT? From all the clues given to us, the \"where\" become apparent. The \"Jefferson Clue\" is one locator of this astronomical event. By naming his house after one of the points on the Golden Triangle in Rome, we know the location of the event in the night sky. Other clues are supplied from the locations of the Spear Point shapes and the background information on the secret societies. The constellation Trianglum is guarded by Aries the ram or Asmodeus (who guards the treasure of Solomon.) The start of the Trianglum was due east on the spring equinox around 1500 BC, the date Moses lead the Israelites out of Egypt - also the first reference of the Ark of the Covenant, the presence of God. In all the places where there is a Shield of Christ laid out, there is also that non-important line which sigh ts the Trianglum and the historical locations of the Ark of the Covenant. In Israel, the Ark was displayed in the Temple of Solomon. In Rome, it was kept at the the Temple Vespasian. In Egypt, it might have been the Temple of the Second Pyramid. The Egyptian zodiac indicates the Trianglum using the Ouadjit symbol, or \"all seeing eye.\" Does that same \"eye\" in the \"t riangle\" on the reverse of the Great Seal of the United States and the dollar bill, indicate another location for the Ark?

Worst yet, they kept it covered up from the general public. A cover-up that has span from its conception until today. With a continual evolution in the street lines as recent as 40 years ago, this group may still be pulling the strings of a puppet government today. It is hard to point the finger of responsibil ity. Most Masons are not even aware that their familiar Square and Compass symbol is laid out in the streets of Washington D.C. But that Square and Compass, along with all the other lines and symbols, constitutes the Nation's largest and oldest monument. An invisible monument that thousa nds of people walk by each day. It is a forgotten monument, that is slowly being scared by new changes to the city that might not fit the original intent. Perhaps the unusual city plan of Washington D.C. is nothing more than an ingenious way of allowing the free flow of tra ffic in an ever expanding city. Perhaps the symbols in the streets of Washin gton D.C. are just a meaningless copy of similar shapes found in the streets of Rome. But, perhaps the streets of Washington D.C. are part of a map for finding a hidden treasure. Perhaps that treasure is the famous Ark of the Covenant, the fabled Holy Grail, or the riches of King Solomon. Perhaps the treasure is not a material treasure, but one of the spirit. A symbolic representation for finding God. The idea that the streets of Wa shington D.C. have been used in rituals for communicating with entities from the spirit wo rld, may be a possibility accordi ng to the rules of magic. The purpose of the Ark of the Covenant was to allow communication with God, and many Catholics believe the Pope has such abilities. The layout of the streets of the Rome, Jerusalem, the Great Pyramids, and Washington D.C. fits the bill. (A pun related to the dollar bill.) Just as George Washington is fabled to have been guided by an angel, perhaps the mysterious street lines of Washington D.C. have somehow guided the direction of the United States throughout its history - As a Good Luck Charm - The Voice of Providence - The Talisman of the United States. \"In this sign shalt thou conquer\""},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"116 APPENDIX I On June 1st, 1990 this researcher received correspondence from an unknown source, who had reviewed the research in this book.

SCALA/ART RESOURCE, NEW VORK, NY"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"APPENDIX V CODE NAME - HERMES Hermes is a Greek mythological god, who was the son of Zeus and the virgin Maia. He is often associated with the Roman gods Mercury and Cadmilus. Considered to be the Greek god of fertility, the phallus serves as his emblem. He is the protector of cattle and sheep. He is known as the ram- bearer. Sometimes he is portrayed as full-grown man with a beard, wearing a cap or a broad- brimmed hat. He is the God of roads and the guide on the path of the Sacred Way. References to Hermes kept cropping up in re searching this book. The painting of George Washington in the White House is depicted after He rmes. The Zero Milestone has a motif of Hermes on the north side. The mantel above the fireplace of the dining room at Mt. Vernon (which George Washington installed in his later years) depicts Hermes the shephe rd guarding the bull and ram. The traditional posture of As modeus in a sitting position appears to have been adopted from the myths about Hermes. Modern day magic is often called the Hermetic Arts, named after Hermes. Some religious scholars believe the legend of Hermes, as the son of Zeus, was adopted from the older Osiris Cult in Egypt, since Isis was the virgin mother of sun god Horus. There are those that believe that the story of Jesus, is an adaptatio n of the Hermes tradition to a Christian frame.

Hawkins wrote an articl e for Nature, titled \"Stonehenge: A Neolithic Computer\" The basic premise of his research was that the two stones uses for sighting the maximum positions of the eighteen year cycle of the moonrise and the heel stone at Stonehenge could be used to calculate the exact day in which an eclipse of the sun or the eclipse of the moon would occur. Using computer dating from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Hawkins discovered that whenever you have the moon rising at any of the three previously mentioned Stoneheng e marker stones, an eclipse of the sun or moon will occur somewhere on the earth on that date. This produces a 56-year sun and moon eclipse cycle. Hawkins states in his book St onehenge Decoded, that astronom ers recently rediscovered this eclipse calculator from Stonehenge. Well, it appears George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Charles L'Enfant understood this calculator, as well as someone in Rome and Jerusalem. It occurred to this researcher that the same observance would apply to the two maximum moon sight lines in Washington, D.C. But what sight line represents the sight line produced by the heel stone at Stonehenge? The answer was obvious, the non-important line (South Carolina Avenue) southeast of the Capital. It sights a hill in the distance. When this hill and other geographic features of eastern Washington, D.C. arc viewed from Lincoln Square, they produce natural geographic points of reference, similar to the two maximum moonrise stones and heel stone at Stonehenge. Like Stonehenge, whenever the moon is seen to rise above any of these geographic landmarks, an eclipse of the sun or the moon will occur somewhere on the earth that same day. This crude eclipse cy cle clock is accurate for about 300 years. So this phenomena should be visible until the year 2091 in Washington, D.C. After that date the moon will rise one year early every 300 years. The same eclipse cycle can be observed in Rome and Jerusalem with a 2 to 8 year error. This scientific data adds to the mystic and occult nature of the Washington Line Complex, since a magician would appear most powerful if he could predict the date in which the sun or the moon would appear to vanish. The invoking and banishing rituals of magic are supposedly best carried out at the time of an eclipse.

As previously discussed in Chapter Three (see page 61), the pole star will appear to change positions because of the 23.5 degree tilt in the earth's axis. This 47 degree angle reflects this tilt in the earth and maximum positions of the north star. The pole star position will appear to travel as the earth moves a full revolution on the 23.5 degree tilt in a 26,000 year period. Already the north star position has started to move toward Dupont Circle reflecting a 200 ye ar change in position. The full cycle will occur when the polar star position has traveled from 16th Street to Dupont Circle back to Logan Circle and then back to 16th Street. Note that Logan Circle is part of Rhode Island Avenue that points to the constellation Taurus. In the year 4000 B.C. the sky of the southern horizon on the day of the vernal equinox displayed the earth's equator and the celestial ecliptic intersecting the earth's north-south polar axis at a point between the horns of the constellation Taurus. When the polar star is aligned to Logan Circle, as viewed from the White House, this same astronomical conjunction will occur. THE MISSING STREETS J AND B In Freemasonry the letters J and B represent th e two great mystical pi llars Jachin and Boaz created by King Solomon. These pillars are associated with the two astronomical globes - the earth globe and the celestial globe (see page 50.) It appears the letter J was never used to name a street in Washington, D.C. North and Sout h B Streets were renamed to Constitution and Independence. Thus there are no J and B Str eets in Washington, D.C.
