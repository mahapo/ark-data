A. Schwaller de Lubi cz for the first time. Schwaller de Lubicz is using words and thought forms that are peculiar to our present rationalized mentality but with the intention of describing or, rather, ev oking in us a mentality completely different from our own, one th at belonged to the sages of ancient Egypt. And it is f or this reason, more than any other, that difficulties can arise for us in the reading. Generally, these two complementary mental operations can be designated as analytical (our pre sent habitual mode) and the more ancient analogical mode, but the se words must be taken in a deeper sense than that generally ascribed to them at present. Schwaller de Lubicz's writings, then, act as a \"synapse\" between these two polarities of inte lligence, and one finds that a clear, logical exposition—be i t architec- tural, scientific or mythological—will suddenly lif t and expand into an immense interconnected thought-field of an extra- rational quality, in which the multiple simultaneou s meanings, while inwardly felt, may no longer be available to our rational mind. These unannounced fluctuations between our tw o primary modes of knowing is at first disconcerting, but, if one persists (sometimes without really grasping the ide a), one can obtain glimpses of a new relationship between inner knowing and sensory-based external analysis. Derived from his extensive study of Egyptian monume nts and hieroglyphic writing, Schwaller de Lubicz's the me of two qualitatively different minds inhabiting the human psyche has 7"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"found very convincing support in recent brain resea rch. Experiments with brain-damaged individuals has reve aled a distinct separation or lateralization of cortical f unctions giving rise to an area of scientific investigation popular ly known as \"right and left mindedness.\" The left hemisphere processes information sequen- tially, the right hemisphere simultaneously, acces- sing several inputs at once. The left hemisphere works in series; the right in parallel. The left hemisphere is something like a digital computer; th e right like an analog computer. 1 This localization in the right hemisphere of the hi ghly intuitive aspects of thought together with the capa city for non- verbal pattern recognition, is consistent with the dominant quality of mind which, in Schwaller de Lubicz's vie w, could have produced the temple architecture and hieroglyp hic writing of the ancient Egyptians. Through myth, ima ge and geometric proportion, Schwaller de Lubicz believed, the Egyp- tians were able to encapsulate in their writing and architec- ture the basic pattern structures of the natural un iverse. 2 Brain research reveals that musical ability seems a lso to be located in the right hemisphere, particularly the r ecognition and recall of tone, harmony and melody. These music al aptitudes involve auditory pattern recognition of a holistic and often simultaneous nature, very different from the analytical and verbal processes which are located exclusively in the left hemisphere. The separation of the visual and verbal from the sonar and intuitive has deep implications in defini ng the difference between esoteric and exoteric knowledge.

He claims that this imbalanc e in intracortical representation and communication migh t be con- sidered a rudimentary cause for the conflicts, diso rders and discrepancies which presently pervade our intellect ual and social life. In this brief work, Schwaller de Lubicz examines sy mbol- ism or, rather, the symbolic method in general, not from the point of view of our contemporary use of symbols as conven- tional designations, abbreviations or as literary, metaphoric devices, but as the means for transmitting a precis e supra- rational knowledge and intuitive vision which, he c ontends, was a major aspect of ancient science. The symbolic attitude of ancient knowledge cultivat ed the intellect to the extent of perceiving all of the ph enomena of nature itself as a symbolic writing revealing the f orces and laws governing the energetic and even spiritual asp ects of our universe. Modern science, particularly subatomic physics, has , as Schwalier de Lubicz points out, expanded its knowle dge of matter to the point where Nature must be considered supra- rational (as being beyond the limits of rational me thods and formulae). These new discoveries and ideas, he emph asizes, demand a new and as yet unfound vocabulary, as well as a radically different approach to education and knowl edge itself. This view places Schwalier de Lubicz at variance wi th some contemporary writers such as Fritjof Capra who, in The Tao of Physics, contends that we can with our present scie ntific methods move directly into a science with spiritual dimen- sions. Schwalier de Lubicz denies this possibility, empha- sizing that the achievement of a sacred science req uires a transformation of mind which would considerably alt er our relationship to knowledge and its expression. It is here that an 9"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"understanding of the hieroglyphic intelligence of t he Ancients may assist contemporary thought in surpassing the i ntellectual impasse presently incurred by our rational percepti on and methodologies. Let us try to clarify the differences in the symbol -making processes belonging to each of these two mentalitie s, for undoubtedly the underlying theme of the book is an attempt to lead us from reading in our ingrained, logical, sequential manner toward the immediacy and sense of identity a vailable through the hieroglyphic image. It is through the r ich and exacting array of ancient hieroglyphic writing that analogical thought is lifted from subjective, poetic or person al insight to a precise, communicable, universal knowledge-activity upon which a science of nature can be founded. Let us amplify this comparison. With our present fo rm of writing we use groups of arbitrarily formed abstrac t symbols (our alphabetical letters) which convey memorized s ound and visual associations. We are trained to think and co mmunicate through these alphabetical letters—placed in certai n (again, memorized) groupings, or words—by reducing these ab stract conventions into objective images in our minds. Sim ply stated, this means that when we read cat, we immediately re gister the formed image: . 3 This habitual reduction from a nonob- jective mental abstraction to a delimited image can be seen as an initially centripetal action, which, subsequentl y, disperses perception and knowledge into a classification of d isconnected facts. We use numbers in a similar way, moving from abstract symbols to quantitative evaluations. But hieroglyph ic writing works in the opposite or centrifugal direction. The image, the form, is there concretely before us, and it can thu s expand, evoking within the prepared viewer a whole complex of abstract, intuitive notions or states of being—qual ities, asso- ciations and relationships which cannot be describe d or defined but only experienced. A centering sense of unification 3.

A method of viewing is required comparable to our h earing faculty: one must learn to listen to the symbolic i mage, allowing it to enter into and pervade one's consciousness, as w ould a musical tone which directly resonates with the inne r being, unimpeded by the surface mentality. In this moment of inner identity between the intellect and the aspect of th e tangible world evoked by the symbol, we have the opportunity to live this knowledge. 4 \"By the hieratic symbolic method the aim is no longer to translate things into sensory terms, b ut to put ourselves into the state 'magically' identical with the symbol- object, so as to become heavy with the quality of w eight, to become red with the quality of redness, to burn wit h the quality of fire.\" 5 These two mental processes then reverse the sequenc e of centrifugal and centripetal movements. The analytic al mode first reduces abstractions to a defined image, foll owed by a proliferation of disconnected facts. The analogical mode, on the other hand, first expands from the image into f ar-reaching associations, then inwardly unifies. Lao-Tzu, who a lso lived in a hieroglyphic epoch, expressed this interplay thus : \"In order 4. Recent experiments with dolphins give us an example of what we might consider as a purely sonar writing. In Dragons of Eden, Carl Sa gan reports that \". . . dolphins and whales, who sense their surrounding with a quite el aborate sonar echo location tech- nique, also communicate with each other by a rich a nd elaborate set of clicks whose interpretation has so far eluded human attempts to understand it. One very clever recent suggestion, which is not being investigated, is that dolphin/dolphin com- munication involves a re-creation of the sonar refl ection characteristics of the objects being described. In this view a dolphin does not \"s ay\" a single word for shark, but rather transmits a set of clicks corresponding to t he audio reflection spectrum it would obtain on irradiating a shark with sound waves in t he dolphin's sonar mode. The basic form of dolphin/dolphin communication in this view would be a sort of aural onomatopoeia, a drawing of audio frequency pictures —in this case, caricatures of a shark. We could well imagine the extension of such a language from concrete to abstract ideas, and by the use of a kind of audio r ebus—both analagous to the development in Mesopotamia and Egypt of human writt en languages. It would also be possible, then, for dolphins to create extraordi nary audio images out of their imaginations rather than their experience.\" 5. R.A.

In the Treatise on Initiations attributed to H ermes Tris- megistus, we find a dialogue between Hermes and the initiate Asklepios who asks: Asklepios: Are, then, not all men similarly conscie nt, Trismegistus? Hermes: All, Asklepios, have not the true intellige nce. They are deceived when they suffer themselves to be drawn after the image of things, without seeking fo r the true reason of them. It is thus that evil is produced in man; and that the first of all creature s lowers himself almost to the level of brutes. 6 In one phrase this Hermetic text reveals this intel ligence (which Western society has exaggerated and upon whi ch it has become dependent) as the source of evil in the world—evil being understood here as disorder, disharmony and o bscurity existing between humanity, nature and God. Obviously, a special training is needed to practice the Sym- bolic Method; moreover, an intentional reorientatio n and reeducation of the mind is necessary for humanity t o progress in the direction of the expanded consciousness requ ired by our evolution. The need for this growth of consciousnes s is presently imposed upon us by the crisis and confusi on existing in all spheres of life—moral, philosophic, environm ental, scien- tific.

Schwaller de Lubicz's penetration of the Egyptian symbolic method may be of assistance in th is urgent- ly needed transformation. In conclusion, it may be helpful to give an example of a hieroglyphic reading, drawn from another work by Sc hwaller de Lubicz, in which he amplifies the essential conc epts presented here. 7 It should be noted first that not all hiero- glyphics were clear depictions of particular specie s of animals, plants, et cetera. Often a single image would be ma de up of a collection of parts drawn from various species (the head of a lion with the body of a woman, for example, or the body of a quail with the head and wings of a duck). In this w ay the image as a whole could depict subtle combinations a nd inter- changes occurring in the energetic activity of the play of nature. But we shall content ourselves here with th e simple image of the jackal and observe the way the image e xpands in multilevels and far-reaching associations. In civilizations such as ancient Egypt, what we in our pre- sent presumptuousness call \"primitive animal worshi p\" was not a worship of the animal itself, but a consecrat ion made to the vital function which any animal particularly in carnates. It was not, in reality, a worship; it was a meditation used to support and clarify an essential function of nature , that is to say, a Meter, a god. The Egyptians saw the jackal a s incar- nating certain characteristics, functions and proce sses of universal Nature. The jackal is an animal which tea rs the flesh of its prey into pieces, which it buries and does n ot eat until they rot. From this real, observed behavior, it bec omes a sym- bol for both a metaphysical and physical process: d igestion. Digestion is one of a number of universal processes which all 7. Sacred Science, the King of Pharaonic Theocracy (New York, Inner Traditions, 1982). 13"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"forms born into nature must undergo (others include growth, assimilation, coagulation, decomposition, transform ation). Egyptian wisdom teaches us that no being or form ca n begin the processes leading to rebirth before its form or bodily envelope has disintegrated. The jackal-headed Neter , Anubis, is always pictured leading the soul of the deceased into the first stages of the lower realms of the dwat, or wo rld of trans- formations. In mummification, the organs of the dec eased were removed, dehydrated, and placed in urns. The u rn holding the intestines had a jackal drawn on it. Th e intestine also serves the function of digesting food already broken down in the stomach. The jackal also transforms putrifie d flesh into life-giving nourishment. \"What would be poisonous f or almost all other creatures in him becomes an element of li fe through a transformation of elements which are bringing abo ut this decomposition. \" 8 The jackal is also the symbol of judgment: it is ca lled \"the Judge\" because, in eating, it performs a precise, i nnate discrimination, separating out the elements capable of trans- formation and future evolution from the elements th at are untransmutable within their present cycle. Digestion is a destructive process: it is an analys is, a break- down of material forms into their constituent eleme nts. Our analytically directed minds are \"jackal\" in functio n. Not only do we analyze our society as it undergoes a decompo sition, but our analyzing, separating mentality is the forc e that is destroying it. We are disintegrating not only the a toms of matter, but our social institutions, the very chara cteristics of our own psychological makeup and physical well-bein g, and other forms, such as religion and spiritual teachin gs from many cultures. But perhaps we are performing this s eeming desecration in harmony with the laws of nature, whe reby the death of the old gives life to the new. The jackal, however, 8. Isha Schwaller de Lubicz, HerBak, (New York, Inn er Traditions, 1979) 14"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"knows innately that the destructive analysis must b e arrested at just the right moment. He must dig up the morsel s, or else these pieces of flesh—or these phases in the collec tive life of humanity—may pass into an indigestible, untransmute d state of disassociation or chaos; then the possibility of a cyclic rebirth in a continuity from death to new life coul d be lost. The Egyptian sage would tell us that we must worshi p-the jackal function in us and find out from it, through identifica- tion, the precise timing and laws applicable in the delicate process of the transmutation of our epoch. Modern brain research suggests that the separation of intel- lectual functions is a result of our evolutionary b ackground, and it offers possible symbolic reasons for the use of these curious animal images in ancient art, mythology and hieroglyphics. If we cast Schwaller de Lubicz's the ory into modern physiological terms, we could say that this imagery is in reality an analogical language depicting levels of somatic information derived from evolutionary experiences w hich have been inscribed in the neurophysiology and morpholog y of our brain. This brings his study of ancient symbolism i nto a syn- chronicity with the recent work of brain researcher Paul D. MacLean. MacLean has proposed that the triune anato mical division of the brain into hindbrain, midbrain and cerebral cortex parallels distinct functions which developed during successive phases of our evolution: the hindbrain ( stem, pons, medulla and cerebellum), which controls the automat ic and autonomic reactions particularly involved with terr itorial mechanisms of survival and agression evolved during our rep- tillian phase. The midbrain or limbic system, which contains the cranial endocrinal glands that govern sexual de velopment, sleep, dreams, passions, pleasure and pain, emotion s, anxiety and the early mental function of visual retention, emerged during the early mammalian period. Last to develop was the cerebral cortex, which controls conscious brain act ivities, reason, willful action, analysis, logic, calculatio n and voluntary 15"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"mobility. Each new brain structure grew as a periph eral envelope encasing the older brain component. Beneat h the cerebral cortex the two earlier forms are still per forming as they did in our most remote ancestors. \"The human brain,\" MacLean holds, \"amounts to three interconnected biological computers,\" each with its own special intelligence, its own subjecti vity, its own sense of time and space, its own memory, motor, and other functions. Each brain corresponds to a separate major evolutionary step. The three brains are said to be distinguished neuro- anatomically and functionally, and contain striking ly different distributions of the neurochemicals dopa- mine and cholinesterase. 9 With this new scientific input we can more easily g rasp Schwaller de Lubicz's claim that anamistic symbols of animal, bird and reptilian-headed deities were means for ev oking par- ticular qualities and \"awareness phases\" in the con tinuum of the evolution of human consciousness. As Carl Sagan proposes 10 \"... the hallmark of a successful, long-lived civi liza- tion may be the ability to achieve a lasting peace among the several brain components.\" And as Schwaller de Lubi cz indicates, Egypt and other cultures grounded in the symbolic method, were indeed, through symbols, educating the neurological structure of the brain to maintain an active, con- scious connection not only between the bilateral lo bes of the cerebral cortex, but also with the impulses and sub liminal information received from the ancient and deeper li mbic and reptilian centers, so that these aspects of our nat ure could be 9. Carl Sagan, op. cit., p. 55. 10. Carl Sagan, op. cit., p. 234. 16"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"integrated into the activity of our reasoning mind. Experimental evidence thus indicates that contained in our brain are functioning vestiges of our most distant corporeal minds. As Schwaller de Lubicz suggests, we should t hink of these vestiges not only as animal drives and gross, inconscient aspects of our consciousness, but also as a vast in stinctual intelligence of the laws of nature, that our animal and rep- tilian experience has left in us. Instead of repres sing and ignoring the wholeness of our evolution, should we not pursue ways to incorporate the vast symbolic content of th ese ancient brains into our present intelligence? Thus the symbol is a material representation of imm aterial qualities and functions. It is an objectification o f things subjec- tive in us and subliminal in nature, awakening us t o a percep- tion of the world which may make us aware of a know ledge contained in our soul. There are many who have foreseen the great intellec tual and spiritual advances toward which humanity is now impelled. But in the work of Schwaller de Lubicz we are given a direction, not towards an abandonment of the rati onal faculties in yogic ecstasies, but of an integration of it with a higher, innate intelligence. This direction consist s of \"tech- niques of thinking\" such as the laws of \"crossing\" and \"inver- sion,\" the application of the principles of the \"Pr esent Moment\" and of the \"simultaneity of opposites,\" as well as a spiritual perception of the mathematical sciences. All of these require a yet unformulated utilization of symbols w hich may synthesize the two complementary modes of our intel ligence, and thus stimulate and eventually give expression t o this impending growth of consciousness.

We can readily sympathize with s tudents of Egyptology who, after long years of study, have mas tered the hieroglyphs and grammar—which make perfectly good s ense when applied to \"secular texts\"—only to be faced wi th mythological texts at least as enigmatic as the rep resentations they purport to explain. Yet it is impossible to concede that the Ancients c overed hundreds of meters of the walls and ceilings of the long cor- ridors hollowed into rock, culminating at the tomb' s Burial Chamber, with nonsensical figures. If we dismiss th e view that these figures and texts are nonsense, we are then c onfronted with the possibility that we are dealing (as the te xts them- selves indicate) with a cosmogony summarizing the t otality of the problems raised by the mystery of creation, a c reation viewed as everpresent and constant. But as Alexandr e Piankoff, one of the greatest specialists in the st udy of these texts observes, a great part of this cosmogony esca pes us: As in the missals of the Middle Ages, the Egyptians were often content to indicate by several words or a phr ase a sacred text which the initiate or the priest had to recite by heart. But we are generally incapable of deciphe ring these symbols, which allude to Egyptian myths of wh ich we have only a dim notion. The key to most of the g reat philosophic conceptions of the ancient world has be en lost,, and we are often tempted to apply to these w ritings 1. A.

Now, we are not dealin g with mysticism, but, as understood by the Egyptians of the New Kingdom, physics—physics which strangely recalls the ideas of Heraclitus of Ephesus. Indeed, as I compared the right and left walls of the Burial Cha mber (of Ramses VI), this verse of Lucretius 2 came to mind: \"the sun, after its passage under the earth, at the moment of its return to the horizon, casts forth it s rays with which it strives to enflame the sky. Or, again , at the fixed hour, the fires are gathered together, concou rsing regularly from numerous atoms of heat which each da y produce a new sun, endowed with new light. Thus, it is said that from the high summits of Ida one perceive s, at the birth of day, the scattered fires which then me rge into a sort of singular globe and form a perfect disk.\" 3 In a similar way, using certain keys which de Lubic z makes available, the modern viewer can begin to transcrib e the strange imagery of the ancient figurations into the abstract formulas of the various laws and properties of matt er and motion given to us by modern science. Thus, for exa mple, we can interpret the predominant role ascribed in Egyp tian mythology to negative and resistant entities such a s Seth (the dark antagonist of Horus), the serpent Apophis, et cetera, as specific correlations with physical qualities, such as resistance, inertia, and entropy. Another specialist, intrigued with these negative entities, writes: Why has revolt been conceived as an element of the crea- tion, whereas it would have been simple enough to o mit it, and thus assure a universe of eternal felicity? In fact, we find again here an idea that appears often in st udying Egyptian texts: myth, at least in its most primitiv e form, is not a pure conception of the mind or spirit but often appears as a prescientific attempt to define and ex plain 2.

Now, disorder, storm, excessive or insufficient flooding [of the Nile], terrestrial or cosmic disasters are visibly part of the created universe. 4 To summarize, those who have profoundly studied Pha raonic writings unanimously observe that the ancient Egypt ians reveal, through their stories, figurations, and max ims, a form of thought that is balanced and clear when dealing with con- crete life. Quite different, however, is Pharaonic theology, \"from which logic is absent. . . .\" But even if it accepts the nature of ancient myth as a \"prescientific\" attempt to explain the universe, the Western mind remains disconcerted by the lack of rational form in its presentation. The Germ an Egyp- tologist E. Hornung offers a valuable insight in re gard to this seeming inconsistency: According to western logic, it is an unthinkable co ntradic- tion for the believer to see the divine as the near ly absolute Unique and at the same time as the Multipl e; it is surprising to us that the two forms of thought, so funda- mentally different, do not annul each other, but ap pear, on the contrary, as complements . . . . 5 Moreover, after having observed that every applicat ion of our dualistic logic to Pharaonic theology leads to inso luble contra- dictions, the same author arrives at the following conclusion: The notion of complementarity has long played an im por- tant role in the subject of an enlargement of class ical logic. Neils Bohr introduced it into physics in 192 7 in order to grasp the extravagant behavior of energeti c quanta, and to explain the simultaneity of place, o f impulsion, of wave and particle, which is impossibl e with the calculations of traditional logic. 6 4.

One of these deals with the ex oteric (historic) meaning, which generally serves as a fou ndation, that is, as a symbol, for the esoteric sense (expre ssed through the symbolic) which these texts, legends, and repre sentations would not have transmitted had the people seen them as non- sensical rather than as stories forming an image th at they could understand and eventually disseminate. Exotericism is thus a necessity, since thought need s support. But when it is a question of penetrating the state of mind of an epoch or the secret meaning of texts (a meaning that is the basis of Egyptian knowledge, for example) only the symbolic can reach that far. The symbolic relies on artistic expression, on the themes of the representations, on architectu ral princi- ples, on parables, legends, and other writings. The latter are presented in cabalistic form, one of whose aspects is addressed to the uninitiated, and can, for the most part, be transcribed.

Even among the grea t mathe- maticians, there are few capable of getting to the bottom of this study.

Is this not the \"false temple,\" the false \"religion ,\" which is based, not on the Spirit, but on perishable matter and the science of its destruction? Now no one wants this \"religion,\" which nonetheless already exists and is spreading; ultimately, world government looks like the only general solution. 4 But already, for their part scientists no longer admit to being controlled by p olitics: it is they who hold the \"secret.\" 5 This secret is not hidden from anyone, anymore than the esoteric teaching of Ancie nt Egypt was; one need only have developed the faculties nee ded to understand it. The example that present-day science offers us thus becomes an image for explaining the nature of the Tem- ple of an esoteric science. Let us not believe in the crocodile tears of scient ists at the prospect of the destruction of humanity: these men know that they can no longer stop in their research, and that , having suc- ceeded in the fission of heavy elements, they dream only of the fusion of light elements. They know that they must go all the way in freeing the Energy that \"God\" imprisoned in matter. This consideration allows us to envisage two positi ons: that which believes in a constructive, liberating scienc e, a science of genesis; and that which accepts a purely rational, analytical science, a science of violent destruction.

We stand before a strongbox containing the greatest wealth concerning the history of humanity; we have not bee n able to open it, because we have insisted on using the rati onalist key, rather than that which the makers of this jewelcase used—the symbol and the symbolic. It is true that the symbolism has given rise to man y strange notions, warranted by the fact that its meaning is little known. 6 6. Many attempts were made to penetrate the meaning of the pharaonic enigma by interpreting images and figures by means of symboli sm. Here the door remained open to errors due to subjective judgements, because it is difficult, in this domain, to remain positive. It is evident that an effort was m ade to base each attempt on a guiding theory, which sometimes took on the charact er of a more or less coherent philosophy. Later, rationalism thought that it could reject the se attempts in their entirety, being convinced that, with Champollion's discovery of a l ogical reading, it would be easy to see clearly into the Egyptian mode of thought. It w as therefore translated into our modern languages, in the modern spirit, and, moreov er, it was thought possible to translate, solely on the basis of grammar, texts re served for the temples. This has revealed nothing: neither the true mentality of the Ancients, nor their real knowledge of the forces of Nature.

This will perhaps enable us one day to recognize th at there exists no hieroglyphic language, but only a hierogl yphic writing, which uses the symbol to lead us toward the symboli c. tzu's Tao Te Ching in China. All these writings are based on the intention of leaving up to the eventual reader the choice of interpretat ion, and of selecting, by this means, those morally and spiritually inclined to understan d the true meaning. Often these texts are presented in a kind of \"telegraph style,\" showing no grammatical connection between the substantives—that is, avoiding the gram matical guide of thought Now, com- pared to the Hindu texts (which, moreover, have gen erally been transcribed several times), Ancient Egypt offers the advantage of the s ymbolic method of the form of writing.

It would, however, be a mistake to let oneself be perm anently led astray by a science which cannot cross the border d efined by the obligation always to rely on a system of refere nces. But we must recognize that a great step has recently been made in the \"expansion\" of human consciousness; in fact, it is a question not only of an enormous scientific advance, but abo ve all of an extremely important stage in the evolution of consc iousness. It is not the acquisition of a knowledge base of an in variable nature; it is a new starting point for the progress of thought. The present stage of this progress, the cause of th e serious revolution undergone by scientific thought for abou t three decades, allows us to distinguish the principles th at underlie the real meaning of the symbol. What, only yesterda y, could be taken as pure philosophic speculation is today b ased on scientific experiment, with staggering consequences that few people are as yet aware of, since most remain faith ful to the rationalist determinism of the 19th century. The last century was characterized by the skyrocket ing importance of science, which thinks itself capable of explaining all the phenomena of Nature, based on the \"mechanis tic\" thinking that it is possible to predict the course of a phenomenon when the conditions of its manifestation are known.

The only acceptable guide for the scien tific mind, having become purely experimental, was a logical co nclusion derived from experiment. All philosophy and researc h con- cerning the \"why,\" necessarily leading to the metap hysical stage, was ultimately considered as fanciful extrap olation. The \"secret\" and the \"sacred\" seemed like nonsense, and anti-religious tendencies developed, since human sc ience could do everything, or at least it hoped someday to acqu ire this omnipotence. Under the cover of atheism, man substi tuted himself for God, since his Cause and his End were n one other than his present existence. If one wishes to understand the new state of mind, it is important to observe the mentality of this mechanis tic science.

Thus it can be observed that there are at most seve n elec- tronic layers around the atomic proton, recalling t he seven- fold planetary system and its metallic corresponden ces, the musical scale, colors, etc. Let us add to this the seven funda- mental constants: e, charge of the electron; m, mas s of the electron; M, mass of the proton; h, Planck's consta nt; c, speed of light; g, constant of gravitation; , cosmic constant. Now, it is the \"constant\" of which Henri Poincare h ad a presentiment and which was determined by Professor Max Planck, that plays a leading role, especially in th e discoveries of Louis de Broglie. Planck's constant (h) is, in b rief, an invariable ratio between the Energy (E) of a photon and the duration (d) of its vibration, such that E x d = h, whatever the wave or the color of the light is, or the wave of a ny other radiation. 2 By designating the inverse of the duration, that i s, the frequency, from we get E = , and is the quan- tum of Energy, that is, the smallest quantity of En ergy whose multiples constitute the whole. If E diminishes, d increases, and vice versa. This \"quantity\" of Energy is the cu rrent basis for all reasoning in microphysics. This theory of t he Quanta of Energy, broadened into the principle of the quantum of action, later worked on by Einstein and Bohr, is one of the finest \"illuminations\" of the scientific spirit of the tim es. Then, founded on these bases, it is certainly the discove ry of Louis de Broglie, 3 along with that of Heisenberg, that most disturbs 2.

Inversely, if one can specify the spee d of a mov- ing object at a given moment, then it will be impos sible to know its exact location. Certainly it is a matter of intra-atomic phenomena. The fact of observing the location of the electron—or at lea st the probability of its position—signifies an action in regard to it, which modifies it or changes its course. Thus, the fact of observing the phenomenon modifies its nature, so th at, at a given moment, only one of the two elements can be k nown exactly: either its location or its speed. We can l ater \"group\" these data, separately observed, in order to acknow ledge the simultaneous phenomenon without really knowing it. Today this uncertainty principle plays a leading ro le in scientific thought. The faith that we placed in mec hanistic determinism in the last century has given way to a doubt that opens the door to philosophy. Heisenberg also plays a truly \"iconoclastic\" role i n micro- physics. He rejects all imagination, and hence the assumption that electrons possibly move circumferentially, in the manner of planets, around a nucleus or sun (as Bohr acknow ledged) when it is known for certain only that there are \"l ayers\" with varying potentials. The \"uncertainty principle,\" does not enable us to locate the electron when it is moving at full speed; thus, we can know its location only as a probability. Heisenberg excludes the aspect that is in fact unknowable and is satisf ied with the knowable aspect of the differences in energy potent ials. In defining the atom—or, more exactly, its nature—thus , solely by the numbers representing these energetic values of the various electronic \"layers\" or stages, he counters a concrete, assumed image with a purely mathematical \"matrix im age\" corresponding to the observable fact.

Our old laws no longer apply to the atom—that is, t he consti- tuent of matter. They remain valid for matter, but in the atom, for example, Newtonian gravitation no longer plays a part: it is the electromagnetic effects that come i nto play. This is a fact, but one that needs to be studied, for we are still con- fronted with the unknown that the \"affinities\" repr esent. On the other hand, the chemistry of Lavoisier is happi ly dead, since we now know that matter is constantly vanishi ng into energy and that energy ceaselessly creates matter ( through transmutation into isotopes). We know that in the u pper atmosphere nitrogen is transmuted into an isotope o f carbon, which then \"nourishes\" all vegetation—a fact that t hrows (or will throw) a curious light on to the \"vital\" pheno mena on the earth's surface.

It thus becomes impossible to know the phenomenon in its genesis, if we do not call upon, within our- selves, a new form of intelligence which rejects ob jectification in order to replace it with abstract symbols.

Whoever thinks and \"experiences\" with any sensitivi ty will respond to this mysterious call of our time: the Id ea dominates the form; Spirit-Energy dominates matter. Accordingly, I would say to my Egyptologist and arc heolo- gist, historian or symbolist friends: 1. It has been demonstrated that without a philosop hical directive no progress can be made in scientific inv estigation, whatever its nature. If this scientific philosophy is still \"a posteriori,\" today there is nothing to prevent the fact—and mathematical thought allows it to be foreseen—that one day it may be experimentation that becomes \"a posteriori,\" obeying the directive of a thought that has solved the prob lems. This suggests an hypothesis: the application of sci ence would once again become, as in Egypt and Hellas, an empiri- cal science (that is, one without research into cau ses), Knowl- edge being reserved for the Temple, that is, for th e select group of gifted men taught to penetrate this Knowledge becau se this penetration requires—as does our new scientific tho ught— knowing first of all how to think without objectify ing. This is a stage in awaiting the expansion of Consciousness that wil l give spatial vision. In fact, it is obvious, for example , that the \"matrix image\" is merely a method and not a final a ttain- ment and that it should be possible \"to objectify,\" in a higher form of intelligence, a continuum of four-dimension al volume just as well as we now do with Euclidean volume. If evolution exists, it can only be an \"evolution o f Consciousness,\" and it is probably there that one s hould look for the cornerstone of the new biology, which we sh all discuss some other time. 2. The observation of a simultaneity of mutually co ntradic- tory states, which we can only know through duality (that is, by means of comparison), demonstrates the existence of two forms of intelligence. 40"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"I propose the following explanation: The first of these forms requires the object or the objec- tification of the concept, hence the placing of the concept in Time and Space. This form may be called \"static int elli- gence,\" which is also designated as \"exotericism.\" The other form of intelligence conceives intuitivel y, but without yet formulating the concept. I call this fo rm \"innate knowledge\"; it corresponds moreover to a certain wa y of see- ing possessed by ancient Greek philosophers, partic ularly Heron of Alexandria. 9 They acknowledged that inscribed in the soul was the universal knowledge that the exter ior object awakens through the senses. Now, it is precisely th e conscious- ness of the state of this innate knowledge which ca n vary, that is, progressively expand and grow richer or poorer. 10 As soon as the intuitive concept—which manifests as a cer- tainty as concrete as an object can be—becomes form ulated (that is, described and defined) it becomes static, \"exoteric.\" Thus, the intuitive form of intelligence can be cal led \"a dynamic intelligence,\" since it can conceive moveme nt, such as a spherical spiral, which is objectively incompr ehensible. In mathematics, these concepts are customarily called \"imaginary,\" like, for example, the Axis, which is (we do well to note) unimaginable. This is, then, that \"dynamic \" intelli- gence which is called \"esoteric.\" 11 9. Heron of Alexandria, Definitions, 136, 1-4. 10. This is noted here without going into an analysis s howing what can sustain this acquired consciousness. 11. Esotericism is outside the rational, and not surrat ional; it is on this side of and beyond the rational. It consists in a consciousness , innate by virture of human genesis, throughout all the types of natural life. For examp le, affinity is an innate knowledge. It is one of the original impulsions for the faculty of c ounting, which is an \"a priori,\" but merely \"exoteric,\" aspect of intelligence. The faculty of reasoning has its source in the impu lsion beyond the rational: esotericism is the cause of Consciousness in genera l. We carry within ourselves—in the form of acquired, latent knowledge—the experien ce of all the beings which, human embryology shows, successively presided over the formation of the human being. There is an esotericism of Science, signifying the abstract sources of what can be known, and a science of Esotericism, which is the p hilosophy of causes. 41"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"These are realities to which the new scientific tho ught must conform. Thus, it becomes altogether logical to cre ate a mathematical philosophy which excludes any objectiv e formu- lation: the value expressed in a formula—whether an impera- tive or an equation—replaces any imagined or even unimaginable form. Moreover, the conventional symbo l replaces long sequences of reasoning. We have reached this point inevitably. Also, inevitably, writing, which links the two stat es or forms of intelligence, is symbolic, since the figured sym bol—all the more correct for being selected from natural forms— alone makes possible the link between exotericism and eso tericism, a link that comes into play in every act of comprehen sion. 3. This profound epistemological 12 crisis—which we are experiencing and which can be interpreted parallel to the general revolution, which is moral as well as socia l and aesthetic—recalls another profound revolution at th e end of the Egyptian era and the beginning of the Christian era. 13 What we are able to find out about the history of A ncient Egypt shows us a similar revolution on the eve of t he Middle Kingdom, 14 circa 2200-2100 B.C. These three dates (the Egyptian date, the beginning of the Christian era, and our own time) correspond only too well in the revolutio nary aspect 12. Epistemology: This term of philosophic language signifies what could be called \"the mentality of the evolutionary stages of intelligenc e\" which all of us carry within ourselves, through heredity. These stages, or \"ment alities,\" change with the evolution of the intelligence. Thus, we carry in us a set of \"mentalities\" which guide us in our intellectual efforts. By noting the percentage of t hese influences, one could thus render an \"epistemological profile or portrait\" of each pe rson. For example, a simple man will be influenced 70% by what is called the \"mysti cal mentality,\" 40% by the \"realistic sense,\" 20% by the \"positive sense,\" 5% by the \"rational sense,\" and 0% by the \"surrational sense.\" In this way one can know how this man will tackle t he study of a problem.

The act of noting this in itself presents an extremely interesting foundation, even for historical study, and one necessarily consonant with the symbolic. Before speaking of the symbol and of the principles that one must know in order to understand its psychology, it would be good to note first what meaning I give to the symbo lic. \"Symbolism,\" which is a mode of expression, must be distin- guished from \"the symbolic,\" which is the applicati on of a \"state of mind,\" or, again, a \"mentality.\" Symbolis m is tech- nique; the symbolic is the form of writing of a vit al philosophy. 44"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Symbolic Modes W HEN AN IMAGE, a collection of letters, a word or a phrase, a gesture, a single sound, a musical harmon y or melody have a significance through evocation, we ar e dealing with a symbol.

This is the common nature of the symbol—somehow its rallyin g effect is like the effect that a few notes of a national a nthem may have on patriots under an invader's yoke. On the other hand, no one would understand the mean ing of U.N., Y.M.C.A., U.S.S.R., etc., if the meaning o f each juxtaposition of initials had not been explained.

On the contrary, a melody evokes moments experience d, producing gaiety or sadness, just as a symphony can trans- port the audience into a spring or autumn landscape . Here it is a matter of an emotive evocation, and the music is its sym- bol. In literature a metaphor is a symbol evoking a meaning by analogy; allegory is a symbol causing a play of the imagination which will replace the description give n. These are examples of exoteric symbolism: all the d ata— symbol and evocation—are objective or objectifiable . The esoteric symbolic is different; it is of a magi cal nature. 1 1.

Such things may be analysed as the shock of the une x- pected, effects of the imagination. But the grating that sets one's teeth on edge is th e effect neither of surprise nor of imagination; it is a con stant effect.

Manifold examples of the \"magic of a nalogues,\" producing reactions at a distance, are esoteric sym bolic effects. Untidy surroundings render the occupants dirty and slovenly.

The assemblage of the parts of a broken potsherd, which could also be represented by a torn note or visiting card, meant—probably in a popular sense— the symbol or (hieroglyphic) sign of recognition. Nowadays any letter or image that replaces the deve lopment of an idea is called a symbol (such as a chemical s ymbol for simple or composite bodies, or the initials of the words of a phrase to designate a group, or a speaking or repre sentational figure for a trademark); but a single conventional letter in a mathematical operation (such as the coefficient Pi for the cir- cle, h for Planck's constant, M for mass, c for the speed of light, etc.) is also called a symbol, as each lette r requires a long development to explain its meaning, thus summa rized. Whether it is a natural or combined image, or a con ven- tional sign, the property of the symbol is to be a synthesis. When, in chemistry, one wished to represent a combi nation, one was led to specify the assemblage of the parts in a static two-or-three-dimensional form, and one had recourse to an image either in plane or in volume. These images ar e symbols—that is, syntheses—and not the true represe ntation of the combination. They serve only as support (intuit ively placed in the schema) of an essentially qualitative function which probably cannot be specified in Time and Spac e.

This can be called an intuiti on-base, forming a scaffolding for the expression of knowled ge through series and groups, implied ideas, atmosphere, analo gies—in short, all the radiation stemming from this symbol- synthesis.

It could be said t hat the abstract Spirit needs a concrete support, which, by its natu re, must be the syn- thesis (located in Time and Space) of the form to b e given to the Spirit so that it may have available the body necessary fo r experience. Later, this support is cast off, leaving the new concept i n its purity. Synthesis should not be considered solely as a prod uct of thought. In the chemical concrete sense of the word , nature offers syntheses. But it is above all in its psycho logical mean- ing that we should take this word. Here is what Kan t had to say about it: \"By the word synthesis in its most ge neral signification, I understand the process of joining different representations to each other and of comprehending their diversity in one cognition.\" 1 To Kant's definition I should add that every natural thing is synthesis for rational science, which must proceed by analysis in order to acquire knowle dge of the component parts or of the nature of the thing. Let me also add what Marcelin Berthelot understands by chemical syn- thesis, \"that which can produce new combinations un known to nature.\" There are three types of syntheses and three types of sym- bols: The vital synthesis—which is the natural symbol and its expression (tangible form, characteristic word or s ound, and color)—is the pure symbol. The action of synthesis, which represents the pseud o-symbol (such as the word, the vocable), replacing the image and determin- ing the concept. 1. Emmanuel Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, trans.

Today the new scientific thought should clearly cal l upon two forms of intelligence, since experiment and obs ervation require a determinist stance in Time and Space, man ifesting, at the same time, the indeterminable aspect of the simultaneity imposed by the phenomenon. 2 It could be said, for the objective intelligence, there is a past and a future but never a Present and that, for Reality, there is an eternal, invariable Present, outside of Time. 3 Fig. 6. The sun at the horizon between the two Aker lions called \"Yesterday\" and \"Tomorrow.\" The commentary on this image reads, \"To me belongs yesterday and I know tomorrow. What is this? Yesterday is Osiris, tomorrow is Re.\" (Papyrus of A ni, Chapter 17). 2.

See the chapter, \"The Principle of the Present Mome nt.\" 52"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"One may opt for either of these considerations. Eac h can be relatively true. But what matters is not a relative truth, but what is real, and by this word I mean that which is invariable. In this sense the symbol does not have to be true, nor to be considered as such; it is not the truth, but it is the \"reality.\" It is objectively determined in Time and Space, but , as simultaneity (synthesis), it is outside of Time. Th e symbol as synthesis is the eternal \"Present Moment,\" because the same conjunction of conditions that created its developm ent will compel it continually to be what it is; this prescr ibes the notion of identity, which is objectively inconceiva ble. There is a reversal of positions for the two intell igences: for the objective intelligence, there is determinism, w here for the unexpressed, intuitive intelligence (innate knowled ge) there is non-determinism. On the other hand, the non-determi nism of simultaneity for the objective intelligence becomes the deter- mined reality for the unformulated, intuitive intel ligence. To explain the preceding, let us take the example o f the coefficient Pi. Objectively, the circle is comprehe nsible only as an assemblage of the bases of triangles having thei r apexes at the center of the circle (Euclid). Thus, one will a ttempt to calculate the coefficient of its ratio to its diame ter by means of polygons and by an estimate resulting from the insc ribed and circumscribed polygons. It is evident that one will never get a finite numb er in this way, and Pi must be an irrational number. One accep ts the \"absurd\" formula of a polygon with an infinite numb er of sides, which attests to the feeling that the circle can in no way be known through polygons: intuitively, we are cert ain that the circle is a line that is curved along every par t of its path, however small that part may be. For instance, let u s make an object describe a circle: it is evident that only a n indefinable, immaterial moment (as an extension of the radius tr acing this circle) will follow the curve, while the object, in its length, will always be only tangent. 53"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"The letter Pi, chosen arbitrarily, becomes a symbol . As a symbol, this Pi synthesizes an objectively incompre hensible, inexplicable function, and every mathematical effor t to calculate this value must, at each moment, call upo n an abstract reality, intuitively known and objectively inexpressi- ble. This is the case for all mathematical symbols and ultimately for the symbol in general. The symbol Pi is a syn- thesis; the symbol c is the synthesis of the speed of light; in Egyptian hieroglyphs, the cubit (the forearm) is th e symbol of the synthesis of measurements, because of its measure o f the universe particularized in the human microcosm, but it is no t a defined measurement. 4 Fig. 7. \"I am this pure lotus which emerges carryin g the luminous ...\" cry the dead (alluding to the Hermopolitan myt h in which the sun is born from the calyx of a lotus rising up fro m the waters), \"... everything takes birth through him, the child (who shines) in the lotus whose rays give life to all beings.\" 4. In this connection let us recall that in China t here is, for the measurement of the human body, a measure (a small measure) called tsun which is on the one hand, peculiar to each individual and, moreover, differen t for the head, the limbs, and the trunk. It is indispensable to know these units of m easurement for acupuncture and for studying pulses.

Egyptian calculation proceeds in thi s way by fractions, as do our mathematics as well. In relati on to a new function, the symbol counts as One. Thus, the symbol is the characteristic principle of Pythagorean number: there is the \"enumerating numbe r\" and the \"enumerable number\" of ordinary arithmetic and the non- enumerable number of the Science of Numbers, the ne w Unity, an entity derived from the \"vital connection \" of the component numbers and not from a quantitative addit ion. There is, for example, a trunk and its branches, co nstituting a tree. This tree, as such, has new qualities; it i s a whole, a new individual. In another category, one can also s ay that a bouquet is a whole which represents what each of th e flowers composing it cannot be separately. We count five fingers, and this number, five, is no longer an addition of five units, but a hand with new qualiti es and a par- ticular power which none of the single fingers can have. Thus, in the Pythagorean sense, each number is a unity in itself, an entity, an individuality, and as such it is nonenum erable.

This \"lure\" is a last reso urce, pending the time when the reality of the \"other intelligenc e,\" that which might be called \"innate knowledge,\" is recogn ized. 2 The statistical conclusion, useful for the collecti vity, is an error in terms of the individual.

Therefore, after r esearch on the atom, it will be necessary to return to the study o f the com- plex (the group) in order to know the simple, since —with the rational, scientific method—the simple is impenetra ble. In our symbolic approach it is understood that the individual is itself composed of a group, but throu gh this group it has become an individuality, that is, a un ity indepen- dent from other similar unities.

This creates our intuitive knowledge of the simultaneous , a con- tinuity in which a discontinuity is located. For example, the image of a bird in flight is the s ymbol of the flight of a winged animal. This image is a stat ic moment (arrested in Time) of this function of flying, its fixation.

The symbol links complements, demonstrates Being, i mplies the positive and negative activities; it is the tra nsient, phenomenal aspect between the causal abstraction an d its negation. Thus, the symbol must always be considered as a rel ationship between two abstract and complementary elements. For example, the hare is not a symbol for the hunte r, because he considers the hare in relation to other game: foxes, partridges, quails. 2. In this connection, let us note that the Spirit, or formless substance, is passive. This is the cosmic feminine principle. It is throug h the effect of odor which is the \"acting verb\" that this \"word,\" through femininity, falls into nature.

For this reason, ail the ph ysical and psychic characteristics, as well as the activities of this hare, will be manifest in this symbol. The hare-symbol, a s a relationship between the principles of its specific seed, is a typal phase, located embryologicaliy (in the cosmic sense) within the development of the ultimate being toward which Nature tends.

The phenomenal consequence of the cause is always \"cathodic,\" because, without resistance, the reabso rption of the causal activity would only be an annulment, and because resistance necessarily causes a reaction. The cathodic effect is the best illustration of the reactive effect, as is shown by the effect of reflection in a Crook's cathode tube. 1 Thus, the light of the moon can be considered a cathodic effect—that is, an effect embodying the rays of the sun. A similar, special effect is produced on each planet; the intensity of the solar flux and the nature of the c athode, as well as the angle of reflection, modify the resulti ng radiation. The \"embodying\" character of the cathode signifies the speci- fication of the neutral incident radiation. Every cause—or, more correctly, every activity—is a cause only because of the opposed and reacting resistance . This reac- tion is a \"phenomenon.\" Neither the emission of the anode nor the obstacle of the cathode appear in the empty tube. The Roentgen ray that results from them is a phenomenon , and we now know that it is a question of a truly new activ ity (reac- tivity) of the atoms of the cathode. 1. The positive current of an induction current (st atic electricity) is introduced, by means of an \"anode\" into a tube that has been made a vacuum as much as possible. Opposite this \"anode\" is the \"cathode,\" which catch es the negative current and con- tains a sort of mirror (metallic foil) placed at an angle of 45°, so as to reflect the positive current caught toward one side of the tube . Once outside the tube, this flux (in the case x-rays) is the cathodic effect. 67"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"This principle of reactivity is applied in the esot eric sym- bolic.

If the curve is not closed but is superimposed, the ce nter becomes a line or a figure, horizontal for a spiral , vertical for a helicoidal curve, etc. The center controls; it is the will of the figure. Three axes of equal length, intersecting at 90°, are the will of the cube. The form of the movement and the form of the Euclidean volume are in the center and in its radiation.

On the other hand, every magnetic effect is contracting will, wh ich produces the dilating, equatorial electrical effect. Inverse ly, every cir- cular electrical current provokes the magnetic axia l effect. Will is esoteric; effect is exoteric. But where, then, is the will of the \"container,\" th e non- Euclidean volume? Its will is the seed, that is, the specification of the \"contents,\" hence a genesis—that is, Time, for Time is none oth er than genesis. Genesis appears to us as Time.

Since, as we have seen, the symbol is the static fo rm of the relationship between two moments which are incompre hensi- ble in their simultaneity, the juxtaposition of sym bols makes possible the expression—without formulation—of iden tities of nature which can manifest in opposing dualities. It is evident that in a vitalist philosophy the sym bol should act as the concept. But this concept has value only through the idea implied, since it is merely the relationsh ip between this idea and its complement. The symbol is thus th e synopsis of a logical function, rather than a concept which fits into a quantitative syllogistic function. This philosophy is that of the vital and \"non-quant itative\" play, that is, it relates functions only and not fa ctors, and thus it cannot include an equational play of syllogism, for which the data (even when abstract) are rendered through com- parison, objectifiable. For instance, \"karyokinesis \" is in itself a non-objectifiable function. It is objectifiable onl y in its static moments and not in its vital, dynamic moment. The e ssence of this function is the scission of a unity: the resul ting duality confirms this for us. It is not this duality which is the scission: as will, this scission is identical to the original scission, or Creation, but it is distinguishable from the latter by the fa ct that it works on something that is qualitatively divisible.

The only way we will ever know this no n-definable idea is through the certainty of our innate knowled ge, which assures us of this reality which is necessarily imp lied in the sym- bol. For instance, if a stone falls, this fact impl ies an attraction which we do not know in itself; we know it only thr ough a juxtaposition of the quantitative elements of an an alysis that can be formulated into laws. We may speak of a mass that attracts, but this tells us no more about what this attraction is. The falling of the stone is an esoteric symbol, if we consider it in terms of the implied idea, but if we regard t his fall as being situated in Time and Space, it is only an exo teric fact, from a quantitative knowledge. Now, it is the \"func tion of that which attracts\" that is cosmic reality, and not the attraction itself, which only acts as such within a certain as pect of matter, as microphysics has recently revealed. 72"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Thus, vital philosophy, expressed by the symbolic, is con- cerned with the eternal vital moment and not its ac cidental applications, in which it can always modify its app earance. Under these conditions, can one reason—that is, con struct a system of vital logic? Certainly, if one does not s eek a conclu- sion arrested in Time and Space. It is Life—dynamis m in itself—that matters; the revelation of the symbol, then, is universal. This means that there is no difference i n the vital moment with respect to the condition in which it ma nifests. For example, if a given plant is an aphrodisiac for a bull, there is in this plant the same functional state (o ne may recall the Arcana of Paracelsus) as that which, for the bu ll, causes its sexual irritation. There is a functional identi ty. Moreover, if this plant (a static moment or a symbol in the U niverse) exists and likewise the bull exists (or even if thi s bull no longer exists), the reality (or Idea) of this plant is, was, and always will be; it corresponds to a phase of the co smic genesis that will persevere, because of the fact of constan t creation. Herein lies a basis for the solution of the problem of original causality. When, through analysis, one arrives at the energeti c origin of matter, one can dispute the principle of origina l causality insofar as one persists in seeing in the phenomenon only a quantita- tive sequence, and as long as life is viewed as a b io-physico- chemical (and today, of course, microphysical) effe ct. The borderline is pushed back; it is not crossed. This reduces the \"cause\" in general to a dynamic effect of quantity, a dynamic caused by the very nature of the energetic constitu tion of the atom. In this case, one sees in Energy only a polar ized Energy, that is, an energetic effect, and no longer an original cause.

Could one conceive science without a system of refe rence? That would be a Fiat Lux, hence a cause outside of the system. The problem that we thought was definitely eliminat ed again arises today, for now we find ourselves facin g an impasse. We resolve the difficulty by acknowledging that eve rything is, ultimately, light—the ultimate system of reference: c = the speed of the propagation of light. Now, is light a cause? If so, in what does it act? And if it is an effect, what i s its cause? Insofar as we have not acknowledged the reality of the \"Present,\" not accepted this moment which is incomp rehen- sible in the phenomenal world, but which imposes it self even on the rational—insofar as we have not accepted the principle of the eternity of the Present, the necessity for a duality, Science and Belief, remains; and \"historians,\" in t heir inter- pretation of tradition, are, to a certain extent, r ight to distrust \"symbolism.\" This notion of the eternal Present requires certain specifica- tions. Exoterically we foresee that, under certain conditi ons, a given cause will produce a given result. All knowle dge is based on this foresight which is the result of observatio n and consti- tutes a primary determinism. This empiricism makes possible the generalization that formulates the laws of scie nce. Now, philosophically, a cause is only Cause at the moment it produces an effect, which is in no way certain. Under the same known conditions, the same cause may happen to produce a very different effect. For instance, we k now today that influences (such as that of cosmic rays) can m odify the effect of a chemical reaction. Let us suppose that a stone falls from the cornice of a house.

In any event, the falling stone will only be t he cause of the crushing of this passer-by (and hence will only produce its effect) if it finds in this man an obstacle to its fall. Before this point, it is not the cause. Cause and effect are not separated by any time. No chemical reaction can liberate the elements during the moment of their passage from one combination to ano ther. Often it is gaseous bodies that pass thus, and no t races prove their existence in the free state. 2 Indeed, just as in biology, in the conjunction of the spermatazoon with the nucleu s of the ovum, 3 as well as in the crystallization of a salt, the c hemical reaction takes place outside of Time. There are, in the world, effects; but the distance in time between cause and effect does not exist. All creation is constant in the eternal Present. Now, fertilization—that is, the vital moment of the conj unction— obeys the law of Creation; it is instantaneous, as is, for exam- ple, the appearance of a crystal in its mother liqu id solution. The same is true of the conjunction of chemical ele ments. It is 2. The following objections may be raised: (1) the ine rtia of matter; (2) the fact that chemical reaction takes place more rapidly under th e effect of heat (in this connection see Van't Hoff's law). In the opposite direction, t hermodynamics shows that at absolute zero (-273°), all chemical reaction must c ease. Heat thus intervenes as a fac- tor in the reaction by dispersing (liquifying) the molecular medium, facilitating the reaction, but temperature in no way modifies its na ture. Whether the reaction takes place rapidly or slowly, the Present Moment of the \"passage\" cannot be located in Time. 3. Fertilization comprises the following phenomena: a. Attraction of the spermatazoa by the ova; b. penetration by the spermatazoon, formation of a defensive membrane, contrac- tion of the protoplasm, and formation of a liquid b etween the two; c. division of the center of the spermatazoon into two centrosomes, before the con- junction of the two pronuclei; d. conjunction of the two pronuclei, while the two centrosomes separate; e. immediate division of the new nucleus (each grou p of its chromosomes is attracted by one of the centrosomes). 75"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" Fig. 13.

This can be better understood through the image of the axis. Every body revolving about itself turns aroun d an axis. The tangential projection of a diameter from the pl ane at right angles to this axis is contradictory at the opposit e extremities. C—center, pole of the axis D—diameter T—tangential projection R—direction of rotation P—precessional motion View, through the pole, of the plan at right angles to the axis. 4. Let us note by this explanation that Time thus b ecomes a quantity in \"duration\" through the juxtaposition of parts, a kind of granu lation.

The axis, called \"an imaginary line,\" is actually \" a fact of a mystical character\": it exists and nevertheless rem ains exoterically incomprehensible; it is not the abstra ction of a concrete datum; on the other hand, it is impossible to define whether it is effect or cause. If now we consider the symbolic as being constructe d with the symbol conceived as an apparent, transitory phe nomenon connecting complements (that is, abstractions) unif ying in a Present the discontinuity of the appearance in the continuity of this Present, then the symbolic no longer contra dicts the historic fact, and the historic fact appears as the exoteric character of an esoteric reality. Now, it is realit y alone that has a value, which is ineluctable, invariable. In exotericism one never demonstrates the cause out side of the system except with the system, hence in a duali ty, one of whose poles is left to faith. The symbol demonstrates the esotericism which, by m eans of the symbolic, unifies that which is divided and puts an end to the problem of causality. The cause, apparently outside of the system, is in it, eternally united and present, and creation is constant. Such-and-such a phenomenon was not; it is always in our innate knowledge, from which our consciousne ss increas- ingly expands with experience. 5.

Cause cannot be cause without produ cing an effect, which will be a new cause under the conditi ons suitable for its activity. Thus, there may be, in the sensor ial appearance, a sequence of effects but never a seque nce from cause to effect. Time as genesis—or genesis as Time —moves in the direction of the effect becoming the new cau se. Thus, the march of Time is irreversible. These are the da tes of the cosmic genesis, the phases of which are the effects (the static vital moment), as the symbols—or \"things\"—subsist a s indivi- dualities which exhaust themselves, being finished as types and no longer acting as causes.

To illustrate this point, let us consider Numbers. The number One, presumed to be an incomposite, has, philosophically, a double natu re: it is male and female (we may liken it to the Adam of the Genesis of Moses). When the first group forms the entity \"Two\" (which is Eve), the even number is revealed; it is feminine in relation to Unity which, relatively, acts as an odd, masculine number . Insofar as this very first entity which is Three (t hat is, One and Two) is concerned, it manifests only two natures: (1) the sexual natur e, (2) the multiplicative nature of femininity, since the number Two is the first numbe r that can be multiplied by itself. We find ourselves before the first couple, the simp le energetic atom called Hydrogen. But let us now take a more complex entity, the four th prime number which is Seven. The number Seven is odd, masculine, composed of Three (male) and Four (female). This male number Three in fact contains w ithin itself, Eve, the number Two, manifest femininity; it is thus a complete ato m and no longer a non-polarized Energy like the number One, Moreover, the female nu mber Four is a multiplication of Two: a square, or a primary geometrical value and n o longer only an arithmetical value. The natures manifested by the entity Seven have not hing in common with those manifested by the entity Three. The proof is that S even can just as well be One and Six, or Two and Five; that is, it presents in its n ature that of three couples which are very different from one another. The behavior of th is number in no way allows us to conclude that it is governed by the Law that rules the first couple or \"primitive atom.\" Therefore, in order for the statistics to ma ke possible an investigation of causes (that is, of the nature of the individual or of the unity of the group) it must be studied by means of analysis, regressively, in the various simpler groups of which it is com- posed. This leads us back to Descartes and from Descartes to Microphysics, and from Microphysics we return to the \"statistics\" of despa ir, unable to understand the nature of the component without metaphysical revelation. 84"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"the heart and beats as it does. Each cell of the li ver is the liver, etc. One could cite countless examples which throw a mar velous light on existence. But pharaonic Egypt has summarized everything in a symbolic choice of symbols it has made from the elements of its env ironment, a choice so wise that we must bow low before it. 5 Every natural type is a revelation of one of the na tures and abstract functions that rule the world, a verb of t he divine language—that is, the entities or fully realized Pr inciples (Neteru). They are fully realized in the sense that they are types or definite stages in the cosmic embryology o f man. Instead of starting from an imaginary construction, instead of relying on intellectual speculation, ancient Egy pt shows us the path of an infallible recognition of the forces and laws that rule the Universe, by beginning from its concrete r esults to seek in them the causal spirit, otherwise unknowabl e, since all philosophic speculation is vain if it is not confir med by facts. Pharaonic Egypt is essentially practical. It deals with 5. The symbolic always applies, in every case. Ever y gesture, every grimace, as well as the gleam in a person's eye, reveals his impulse or secret thought. His walk, his postures, and countless details of his behavior rev eal a man's character; the aesthetic tendency of an epoch, the style, architecturally, a nd even the nature of the preferred material, are symbols of the character of a period or a people. Thus, one can study the symbolic of any time and an y people. If I prefer ancient Egypt to India, China, Babylon, or Greece, it is be cause it is more accessible to us, by dint of the authentic \"testimonies\" it has left us, and because its entire culture is founded on a symbolic form of writing. This attests to an unsurpassable wisdom, which dared found an empire on the purely symbolic expression of its writing. Any manner of writing formed by means of a conventional alphabetical, arbitrary system can, over time, be lost and become incomprehensible . On the other hand, the use of images as signs for the expression of thought leave s the meaning of this writing, five or six thousand years old, as clear and accessible as it was the day it was carved in the stone; for a chair, a falcon, a vulture, a piece of cloth, a placenta, a leg, a human posture, etc., will not change as long as there are men on earth. This concerns hieroglyphic writing. As for grammatically construc ted language, it is another ques- tion which does not come within the scope of this a ccount. Let us note, moreover, that Egypt's flora and fauna include many species that have never been used for the hieroglyphic symbolic. This shows a choice, hence a will to assemble the basic types of its environment that co uld be designated as \"irreducible,\" for a symbolic required for a cosmic teaching (such as contained in the Osirian, and Horian lunar and solar myths). 85"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Nature and works with natural means in which it see s the symbols of spiritual states, knowable only intuitiv ely. The intellectual definition interests it only secondari ly, as a game of thought and not as a guide. Intellectual analysi s always leads, ultimately, to the necessity of choosing bet ween the subjective and the objective; it resolves nothing, since it must consider everything within a specific duration, whe reas Nature always shows us the closed, self-renewing Osirian c ycle. For instance, the principle of entropy is an exoter ic supposi- tion; the esoteric reality is a constant creation. 6 Our mode of action requires the pre-stated theory. Ancient Egypt, which is realistic, acts naturally, knowing that theory is a fixation which limits action. Thus, one could hav e believed it practiced a simple, empirical science, that is, a s cience of application without research into causes. One forge ts that there is a rigorous method dictated by myth and sym bolic philosophy. 7 6. Entropy represents the loss, in the Universe, of all Energy given off during the physico-chemical reactions of Nature. This phenomen on, considered as the final effect of this Nature (which has an equally energetic orig in) places the world between a beginning and an end. This leaves to chance the sud den existence of a world in the midst of nothingness, which is necessarily understo od as pure, non-polarized Energy. Here we see, grosso modo, a product of exoteric, ra tional science, which always forces us to imprison an idea between set limits, whether in science or in sociology. Even coarse matter is opposed, by virtue of its ine rtia, to an application prescribed by this science. Now, to go with Nature in the directi on of Egyptian Knowledge is not to meet with resistance (that is, is not to provoke th e opposition of inertia). We find this same teaching in Taoism, and the spiritual Judo of Japan is no other than this. Today the energetic working of the atom should show us th e way. What mechanical power must a fly develop in order t o fly straight for tenth of a second, if it is really a question of mechanical po wer? How do the falcon, the sparrow-hawk, and the kingfi sher swoop at speeds that sur- pass the given facts of gravity and acceleration, a nd with no supporting point from which to take off? Already our science no longer sees in weight a mate rial quantity; rather, it sees it as Energy. Logically it is no longer absurd to admit t hat it may one day be possible to counteract weight with energy and even to use the e nergy of animal magnetism, of which it has been proved that man is an extraordina ry accumulator. 7. This is why myth should be spoken of analyticall y. We cannot trust that we shall ever arrive at the mythical principle through the j uxtaposition (syncretism) of dis- persed elements, or that the Myth might be a \"poeti c\" construction, as Professor Alexandre H. Krappe proposes in La Genise du mythe (Paris: Payot, 1925). There is no Mythenbildung (genesis of myth) in the mythic tenet : the latter is a revelation.

This can be observed in certain tombs: the entering is that of the body into the earth; the leaving is the resurrection. What is written and figured must be read in the sense of entering or le aving. This principle applies equally everywhere, in the temple s and in the dynastic style. Often, in certain scenes on a wall, this inten- tion will be noted symbolically by the hollowing an d the relief. It can be found even in the details of a single fac e (eyes, nose, ears). Thus, a symbol becomes a general idea. We mu st there- fore find out what is meant by \"entering into matte r\" and by \"leaving it.\" The left hand receives; the right gives and acts. I n chiromancy the left hand bears the inscription of p redestina- tion; the right hand modifies destiny. This symboli sm of the hands explains certain anomalies frequently observe d in Egyp- tian figuration, such as figures that have two righ t hands or two left hands, or a figure joining its right hand with another's left. Similarly, since the fingers also have a symb olic meaning, one should observe the position of each of them in the gestures of making offerings. Thus, Egypt speaks and explains through images as w ell as through construction. The Principles, or Neteru, are either abstract (par adisiacal, created) or natural powers. The navel, by its absen ce or presence, shows us which. The tableaus on the walls of the covered temple com prise up to five registers in stages. The highest row rec eives the inscriptions of an archetypal nature; the middle ro ws have those of a nature that might be called ectypal or a stral (that is, related to stellar influences or astronomical c ycles).

The symbolic is the mean term between rational intelligence and intuitive knowledge, between the m aterialistic conception and the spiritual conception, which are both unsatisfactory. For this reason, the symbolic is th e best tool for investigating Nature, corresponding directly to the new attitude and to the recent new means of Thought, cu shioning the blow between external dualizing conceptions and intuitive vision. It is evident that every experiment like every reas oning, necessarily must take into account, at its starting point, the \"symbolic nature\" of the object or of the premise, since theory, like experience, is based on the possibilit ies implied— or supposedly implied—in this \"starting point.\" Thi s is the natural (instinctive) attitude, which we would do w ell to render conscious by establishing the symbolic princ iple as a system.

Horapollo, Hieroglyphica, I. 11. 90"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Epilogue I N CONNECTION with two new basic points, \"the Present Moment\" and \"the Constant Creation,\" one can furthe r specify that: The creative Cause is the \"scission\" of a non-quant itative Unity. This scission is a \"self-contemplation\" whic h creates the Ego. It is and will always remain incomprehensi ble; it is the Fiat Lux. The Light (which later and on a lower plane will have its image in the light we see) is the direct, immediate, and final goal of this creative act. It is the Pres ent Moment, the Constant Creation. The latter becomes phenomena l by the fact of \"continuity.\" This continuity 1 is a series of scissions of each new unity (following the \"doctrine of the elem ents\" in the first chapter of the Genesis of Moses). If the light divides, it becomes Fire and Water. Fire in water and water in fire are a new unity, as animated Water. This, in turn, divi des in \"ex- tent,\" that is, into above and below (heat and humi dity). Once again, that which is above divides into heat a nd dryness, and that which is below into water and earth—that i s, cold and dryness. This is procreation, the continuity of the creative act in substance and then in matter. Each procreati ve impul- sion is ruled by the creative act, which is the Pre sent Moment. Thus, the Present Moment without quantity, added to itself, forms the duration, that is, the genesis of the wor ld (this may be compared to the Quantum of action in quantum phy sics). 1. It is this continuity, which Descartes called th e \"continued creation\" that is not to be confused with the \"continuous creation\" under di scussion here. 91"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":" Fig. 17.

This continuity is imperative, but, philosophically , it is not indispensable; it is procreation—that is, mediate, indirect creation—and it bears its fruit at the end of the w hole dura- tion, which is always conditioned by new scissions. This con- tinuity is the evolution of Consciousness, which ha s a predestined end when all the possibilities are exha usted. Now, these possibilities are qualitatively (that is, met aphysically) implied in the Present Moment, since Creation—which always makes out of One, Two—can only engender one series of Ten, comprising Nine factors around the causal, but not phenomenal, Unity (Tetractys). Thus, Creation is constant and has no duration in i tself. It is only when the Light in turn divides that procrea tion or duration begins. The following conclusions may be stated: 1. At each instant there is in the world a beginning a nd an end of genesis. 2. At each instant the procreative lineage may be inte rrupted by the creative act. This can bring an immediate en d to the creature in rejecting the consequence of procreatio n that may be called \"accident,\" and in reducing to its predes tined essence—which, in the simple primordial act, is Lig ht—that light immanent in the creature from the beginning.

Duration or procreation is not indispensable with r espect to the original Cause, but is forced on the creature b y \"imita- tion\"; it is the accident, and, in relation to the absolute order of shadowless Light which is the self-contemplation of the Cause, this duration or genesis is disorder and the division of the causal Unity into quantity.
