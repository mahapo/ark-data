Beginning with the narrative poems of Hesiod and Homer, Classical Mythology: Im- ages and Insights surveys the myths in generally chronological order, including the complete texts of seven Greek plays and several Homeric hymns. (For copyright rea- sons, part of an eighth play, Aeschylus’s Libation Bearers, is omitted.) The primary readings are illuminated throughout by more than two hundred relevant examples of Greco-Roman painting, architecture, and sculpture. While reading Aeschylus’s Ores- teia, students can also study how Athenian vase painters, contemporaries of the play- wright, responded to the drama’s harrowing scenes of murder and revenge (Ghapter 15). The adventures of Odysseus (Ulysses) similarly inspired artistic interpretations of the hero’s struggles against gods and monsters (Chapter 12). The opening chapters, extensively revised for the third edition, explore the nature and function of Greek myth. Emphasizing the relationship of myth to art, religion, history, and society, the first chapter connects specific literary genres in which previ- ously oral traditions were preserved, such as epic, lyric, and tragedy, to specific periods of Greek historical development. In addition to offering some tentative definitions of myth, legend, saga, and folklore, this chapter also examines the particular qualities that distinguish Greek mythology, including its humanism, patriarchal assumptions, and family orientation. The second chapter reviews a wide spectrum of theories that attempt to explain Greek myth, ranging from ancient commentaries to the diverse speculations of modern scholarship. Each literary text in the collection, from Hesiod’s Theogony and Works and Days, to Virgil’s Aeneid and Ovid’s Metamorphoses, is prefaced with an essay that places the work in its historical and social context, inviting students to see the evolving interplay of myth and Greco-Roman society. The concept of the epic hero, such as Achilles or Odysseus, is thus viewed in its Archaic setting, whereas the later heroes and heroines of tragedy, Pentheus, Oedipus, Greon, and Antigone, are examined in the context of the Athenian democracy. New Fedtures The third edition has been significantly revised to enhance its value in the classroom. Besides updating the bibliographies to reflect current scholarship and adding many new terms (boldfaced in the text) to the glossary, we have included several new works. Sophocles’ Antigone now follows Oedipus Rex, replacing the Oedipus at Co- lonus (Chapter 16); the delightful Homeric Hymn to Hermes 2 a\\A The Loves of Ares and 111"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"iv Preface Aphrodite (from the Odyssey) have been added to illustrate the gods’ behavior in the privacy of their Olympian retreat (Chapter 5). Coverage of the major Olympian gods has also been greatly expanded. (Plato’s lengthy “Myth of Er” from the Republic has been deleted to make room for new material.) Fresh poetic translations of several plays, including Euripides’ Bacchae (Chapter 13) and Medea (Chapter 17) and Aeschylus’s Prometheus Bound (Chapter 14) now make these dramas more accessible to modern readers. In addition, an entirely new discussion of the mythic heroine, balancing the presentation of the hero, appears in Chapter 10. An innovative approach, this essay represents a pioneering effort to ar- ticulate a coherent pattern for the female figure comparable to that used to define the male. A new box on the character and adventures of Gilgamesh, hero of the oldest extant epic poem, further illustrates the heroic paradigm. The introductions to virtually every anthologized work have also been rewritten to provide a more helpful analysis of important topics and themes. Discussion of ancient Mesopotamian history and myth has been moved to Chapter 3 to emphasize the parallels with Hesiod’s creation account. Additional parallels between Near East- ern tradition and Archaic Greek culture are highlighted in Chapter 6, where similari- ties between Hesiod’s tale of the first woman’s role in humanity’s decline from a pri- mordial Age of Gold are compared to the biblical story of Adam and Eve’s loss of paradise. Pertinent new information is incorporated throughout the third edition, from data about Greece’s Indo-European heritage in Chapter 1 to contemporary art- ists’ adaptations of Greco-Roman mythological themes in Chapter 21. The entire epic sweep of myth’s evolution from its ancient Near Eastern roots to its modern flowering in America and Europe is thus encompassed in this single illustrated volume. Peddgogicdl Fedtures As in previous editions, the book offers numerous pedagogical devices to aid students who are undertaking their first systematic study of mythology. Each chapter begins with a “Key Topics/Themes” section that clearly summarizes the main points dis- cussed. All major names and concepts appear first in boldface, are given a pronuncia- tion guide, and are concisely defined in an extensive glossary at the end of the book. The pronunciation guides also appear in the glossary. (Although translators employ a variety of transliterations of Greek and Latin names, we generally use the standard anglicized spelling provided by the Oxford Companion to Classical Literature.) “Ques- tions for Discussion and Review” and a short list of “Recommended Readings” ap- pear at the end of each chapter. To provide students with resources for further study, a more comprehensive chapter-by-chapter bibliography is included at the back of the book. Many of the charts, graphs, and illustrations feature captions offering mini- essays on a particular god, hero, or other mythological subject, providing an informa- tive counterpoint to the main text. Finally, the book includes an extensive index, making it easy for students to look up individual names, terms, and topics. The authors have attempted to make the new edition as “reader-friendly” as possible and hope that these features will enhance students’ enjoyment of ancient myths and their enduring relevance to our common human experience."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Preface v For instructors using the third edition, the publisher has issued a revised instructors manual that includes numerous sample test questions and answers, detailed outlines of material covered in each chapter, informational boxes, and suggestions for teaching. In addition, an Internet site dedicated to this text— www.mayfieldpub.com/mythology— c ontains research links, quizzes, and more, and an interactive CD-ROM study guide offers students detailed chapter “walk- throughs,” audio guided tours of the main ideas presented, pronunciation guides, reviews, and chapter quizzes; the study guide can be shrink-wrapped with the text for a minimal supplementary fee. Classical Mythology: Images and Insights remains the only one-volume introduc- tion to Greek and Roman myth that combines many complete works, and generous excerpts from others, with critical discussions of the myths’ thematic content and historical background. A compendium of primary sources and analysis, it consis- tently directs readers to the dynamic way in which Greek and Roman writers revised their mythic legacy, reinterpreting ancient tradition to explore its meaning for new generations.

The oldest surviving myths, from the Archaic period, are pre- served in the epic poems of Homer and Hesiod (eighth century B.C.), who portray the gods as resembling idealized human beings in appearance, psy- chology, and behavior. Paralleling human social organization, the Homeric deities constitute a multigeneration family, headed by Zeus, king of the Olympian gods. The Athenian dramas of the Classical period (fifth century B.C.), a second major source of myth, similarly emphasize the distinctive qualities of anthropomorphism, humanism, competitiveness, and individu- ality. A fluid synthesis of ancient Near Eastern and Indo-European Bronze Age elements that evolved into disparate traditions during the Mycenean, Archaic, and Classical periods of Greek history, Greek myths were further modified by Roman authors, who typically adapted them for political and didactic purposes. /Almost twenty-five hundred years ago, the people of Athens built a new marble temple to honor Athene [uh-THEE-nuh], the goddess of wisdom after whom their city was named. Dedicated to Athene Parthenos (the virgin), the Parthenon (Figure 1-1) was designed to house a colossal statue of Athene by the sculptor Phidias. Phidias also decorated the temple’s two pediments, triangular gables under its peaked roof, with sculptures representing key scenes from Athene’s myth. 3"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"4 The Nature and Function of Myth FIGURE 1-1 A Drawing of the Parthenon and Associated Structures on the Acropolis. A conviction that the goddess Athene presided over and defended their city inspired the Athenians of the mid-fifth century B.C. to create an extraordinary work of classical architec- ture, the temple dedicated to Athene Parthenos (the Virgin). The east pediment, over the Parthenon’s main entrance, depicted one of the cru- cial moments in Greek mythology—the birth of Athene from Zeus, king of the gods. A modern reconstruction of this scene pictures an enthroned Zeus contemplating the daughter who has just sprung, clutching a warrior’s spear and shield, from his head (Figure 1-2). Pictured behind Athene is an unlikely midwife, the god of fire and metalcraft, Hephaestus [he-FES-tuhs], who recoils from the ax blow he has boldly delivered to split Zeus’s skull, providing a birth canal for the goddess. Seated to Zeus’s right is his wife and sister, Hera [HEE-ra], who keenly observes her husband’s latest display of power, his usurpation of the female’s reproductive functions. Although Athene is born from the male rather than the female parent, myth pro- vides her with a mother of sorts, the goddess Metis, an embodiment of cunning intelligence who was Zeus’s first wife. When Metis was already pregnant with Athene, Zeus, fearing fulfillment of the prophecy that she would eventually bear a son greater than his father, swallowed her. Assimilating Metis’s intelligence into his own nature, Zeus then produced from his own body a child manifesting divine wisdom, a pow- erful daughter who supports her father’s rule. Athene is not only Zeus’s wise coun- selor, she is also the goddess of victory in war, the divine being who triumphs through clever strategy and ingenious planning (Figure 1-3). Despite his position as king of the gods, Zeus’s anxiety about being replaced by a younger, stronger rival is well founded, for at the time of Athene’s birth Zeus only recently had overthrown an older generation of gods, the giant Titans, who had been led by Zeus’s father, Cronus. (See Chapter 3 for Hesiod’s account of the older deities who had preceded Zeus as rulers of the universe.) Myth also credits Zeus with giving birth to a second child, his son Dionysus [dye- oh-NYE-suhs], god of wine, intoxication, and emotional freedom (Figure 1-4). In"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Introduction to Greek Myth 5 FIGURE 1-2 The Birth of Athene. In this modern reconstruction of the Parthenon’s east pediment, the central figures of Zeus and Athene confront each other immediately after Athene, bearing a warrior’s spear and shield, has burst from her father’s head. The entire Olympian family of Zeus has gathered to witness the prodigy, including his disapproving wife Hera, who sits holding a royal scepter, indicating her position as queen of heaven. Partly vis- ible behind Athene’s shield is the figure of Hephaestus, god of fire and the forge, who has just split Zeus’s skull with his ax and now appears torn between his satisfaction at having struck Zeus and his fear of Zeus’s displeasure. The scene is rife with family resentments: Hera is outraged by her husband’s preemption of her maternal function. According to Hesiod, she, without male aid, gave birth to Hephaestus, who is entirely her son and who typically takes his mother’s part in her endless quarrels with Zeus. To the viewer’s right is the seated figure of Zeus’s powerful brother Poseidon, god of sea and earthquakes. At the extreme right, Apollo appears with his lyre, a musical instrument symbolizing his patronage of music, harmony, and the creative intellect. (Acropolis Museum, Athens) FIGURE 1-3 A Drawing of the Madrid Puteal. This circular bas-relief, thought to depict the scene of Athene’s birth that Phidias created for the Parthenon’s east pediment, shows Hephaestus recoiling behind Zeus’s throne and Athene being crowned by the winged figure of Nike (Victory). As defender of the polis (city-state), Athene is also goddess of military vic- tory through intelligent planning and strategy. Note that Zeus and Athene meet each other’s gaze at the same eye level. The king of the universe is entranced by the daughter he has just produced—a brilliant image of the divine consciousness. For the Athenians, Zeus’s unique relationship to Athene enhanced their prestige: the chief god’s firstborn child was also their special protector and patron.

The painting on this crater (large wine vessel) shows the infant Dionysus, god of wine and intoxica- tion, emerging from Zeus’s thigh and surrounded by figures representing participants in the ecstatic Dionysian cult. Myth’s insistence that both Athene’s cool rationality and Dionysus’s passion- ate sensuality derive from the same father-god conveys the Greek belief that both disciplined intellect and unrestrained emotion are part of the natural order and therefore equally divine. (Museo Archeologico Nazionale, Taranto) contrast to Athene, who is literally Zeus’s brainchild, a rational force for civilized order, Dionysus represents the irrational forces of both physical nature and human instinct. Derived not from Zeus’s head but from a lower part of his anatomy, his thigh, he is a god who combines joyous sensuality with amoral aggression (see Chapters 8 and 13). As a son of Zeus, Dionysus is half-brother not only to Athene but also to Zeus’s other divine offspring, including Apollo, who, like Athene, exem- plifies the abstract intellect. A god of light, health, prophecy, and the creative arts, Apollo also presents a striking contrast to the emotional extremes of Dionysus (see Chapters 7 and 8). These two images of Athene and Dionysus say much about Greek myth’s presen- tation of the gods’ complex, often contradictory, natures. That a single deity can produce, by himself, two such different offspring—a virgin goddess of formidable austerity and self-discipline and a wine god whose extremes of emotion can reduce society to anarchy—suggests myth’s power to integrate polar opposites. Among its many other functions, myth confronts and defines tensions such as those between Athene’s cerebral control and Dionysus’s wild abandon, recognizing that these seem- ingly irreconcilable opposites express the contrarieties and conflict inherent in human life. Both deities are necessary aspects of a cosmic whole encompassed in the Greek concept of the divine.

Instead of utilizing a professional clergy or hereditary priesthood—ordinary individuals performing the necessary rites and sacrifices—the Greeks acted out their sense of the numinous, the perceived experience of divine or sacred forces present in the world, through honoring ^ h iera, “holy things.” Oper- ating without a supernatural revelation of the divine will, such as the Torah (Divine Instruction) that Israel’s God disclosed to Moses at Mount Sinai, the Greeks com- muned with numinous entities through ritual and other time-honored practices. They learned of “holy things” through witnessing or participating in customary rites at home and at public festivals, as well as through hearing stories about the gods— myths that were also vividly rendered in the paintings, sculpture, architecture, and poetry that were part of their daily environment. Phidias’s representation of Athene’s birth captures a climactic moment in the his- tory of the cosmos, the Greek term denoting a stable, harmonious world order. The goddess’s sudden appearance, leaping fully armed from Zeus’s head, is a sacred event, a prodigy to which all the major gods are pictured as witnesses (Figure 1-5).

The brilliant son of Hyperion [Helios, driver of the sun’s chariot] halted his swift-footed horses. Forgetful of time . . . —Homeric Hymn to Athene, trans. Thelma Sargent Athene’s arrival temporarily suspends the normal operation of external nature—the earth shouts aloud, the sea roars in agitation, and the sun pauses in its orbit, struck with wonder at what the gods have brought forth. In Phidias’s artistic re-creation of this divine mystery, several distinctive aspects of Greek religion stand out. The gods are not one, but many; they have human shape and form; and they—as brothers, sisters, wives, children, or mistresses of Zeus— constitute a family. Whereas modern Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are character- ized by monotheism, belief in one God, ancient religions (excepting that of Israel) embraced polytheism, belief in a multiplicity of gods. The monotheistic God is typi- cally conceived as eternal, without beginning or ending, omnipotent (all-powerful), omniscient (all-knowing), and omnipresent (existing everywhere). By contrast, Zeus and his fellow Olympians, named for their dwelling place atop Mount Olympus, the highest peak in Thessaly, were viewed as immortal, but not eternal. As the myth of Athene’s birth demonstrates, they did not always exist. Because Olympian rule had a beginning in time, it may also come to an end, an eventuality that on occasion causes Zeus some worry. In some myths, the gods are also restricted by limited knowledge: at least early in his reign, Zeus cannot perceive other gods’ thoughts, nor can he always see clearly into the future (see Zeus’s conflict with Prometheus in Chapter 14). Although poets describe them as “deathless,” the gods can be wounded and suffer pain, bleeding a clear liquid called ichor [IH-kohr]. Despite their superhuman strength, some gods can be defeated and even permanently imprisoned, as are the Titans, whom Zeus confines in the Underworld. They can also be misled or deceived, as when Hera beguiles Zeus or Hephaestus tricks Hera (see Chapter 5). Anthropomorphism In both art and literature, Greek myth portrays the gods as resembling supremely privileged human beings, only incomparably stronger, more beautiful, and more powerful, blessedly immune to sickness, old age, or death. When not engaged in manipulating human beings for their own purposes, the Olympians frequently gather at heavenly banquets, where they dine on ambrosia and drink nectar, food that sustains their perpetual youthfulness. Because they resemble humans not only physically but also psychologically, the gods betray character flaws typical of ordinary mortals, engaging in conspiracies and competitions for power and prestige, as well as sexual adventures of every description."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Introduction to Greek Myth 9 Unlike the Judeo-Christian God, they do not jealously demand to be worshiped exclusively; they do, however, punish and even destroy mortals who deny them their due recognition, honor, and sacrifice. They typically favor the person who, like Odysseus, the wandering hero of the Odyssey, properly acknowledges their impor- tance by regularly offering prayers and animal sacrifices. A Greek temple, such as the Parthenon, was literally the house of the god whose image it sheltered, a holy place where a supernatural power could reside among hu- man beings. In contrast to modern churches, synagogues, or mosques, the temple was not intended to hold a congregation. Greek worshipers assembled outside their sanctuaries to perform animal and other sacrifices on outdoor altars. The temples interior was reserved for the divine presence and for the treasures that commonly were stored there, offerings from the devout. Some of the Greek world’s largest and most elaborate shrines, such as the temple of Artemis at Ephesus—one of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world—impressed some viewers as a visible replica of the gods’ celestial abode. As Philo of Byzantium (c. 200 B.C.) remarked, Artemis’s sanc- tuary brought “the heavenly world of immortality . . . [down to] the earth.” The Divine Family As the Greeks visuah^d the gods in their own idealized image and built earthly homes for them, so they ascribed to them the basic unit of their own social struc- ture—the family. In Greek mythology, all the gods are related, descended from the original divine couple Gaea (the earth) and Uranus (the sky). (See Hesiod’s Theogony in Chapter 3 for a genealogy of the Olympian family.) A grandson of Gaea and Uranus, Zeus heads a divine patriarchy, a social organization marked by the supremacy of the father in a clan or family, a sociopolitical arrangement in which male leadership and values dominate and in which women and children generally are subjugated to patriarchal control. Wielding the thunderbolt to enforce his will, Zeus brooks no challenge to his supreme authority; he presides over the gods’ councils and demands strict obedience from his sometimes fractious Olympian family. Although Zeus firmly maintains control of the universe, both material and spiritual, he shares its administration with other family members, assigning each of his siblings and di- vine children a particular function or sphere of activity. The emotional ties, tensions, hostilities, and rivalry inherent in intergenerational human families, with older and younger generations often in conflict, characterize Zeus’s Olympian household. Zeus’s untamed sexual appetite, which drives him to beget children by mothers both human and divine, and Hera’s consequent jealous rages add to the family’s psychological stress. (See Chapters 3 and 5 for a discussion of some myths relating to the principal members of the Olympian family of Zeus.) Although the Greeks honored their gods as potent forces that could either help or destroy them, they also found much to laugh at in theqiymyths’ projection of human foibles and family squabbles onto the divine realm. In the hands of some Greek poets, Zeus’s adulteries, Hera’s devious schemes, and Hephaestus’s physical clumsiness were irresistible sources of humor. At the same time, Greek myth recog- nizes the enormous gulf between divinity and humanity—and humanity’s inferior place in the cosmos. The gods typically assume human shape, but it is only the appearance of a mortal form: at will, Zeus can transform himself into a bolt of light- ning, a raging bull, or a cosmic serpent. For ail their anthropomorphism, the Greeks"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"10 The Nature and Function of Myth realized that their gods belonged to the Others a dimension of reality profoundly different from the material realm to which humans are bound. Mysterious and un- predictable, the gods represent forces beyond human ability to control or compre- hend. Greek deities may command themselves to appear in human likeness—and Greek artists delighted in so picturing them—but they belong to an unknowable mode of existence intrinsically alien to that of humanity. The Literary Quality of Greek Myth and Its Association with Communal Observances Although a component of virtually every world religion, myth—which typically con- veys traditions about supernatural powers, cosmic origins, and the divine-human re- lationship— is notoriously hard to define. The word myth, taken from the Greek mythos (or muthos), literally means “utterance,” or “something one says”—a tradi- tional story commonly set in the remote past and involving the actions of divine beings and/or human heroes. As in other world cultures, Greek myth was originally an oral phenomenon, created by anonymous storytellers and transmitted by word of mouth. During the long process of oral transmission, myth is highly fluid, open to the individual speakers changes at every retelling. As a result, most myths survive in at least several different, even contradictory, versions. In ancient Greece, these differences were reinforced by the region’s rugged terrain and the geographical isolation of the Greek polls (city-state). Because many Greek settlements were separated by steep mountain ranges or inhospitable coastlines, each polis tended to develop its own variation of popular myths, commonly attaching them to tales about the gods who favored their particular city, as Athene cham- pioned Athens, or to local heroes whose exploits enhanced the polis’s reputation. Leading families of a given polis typically compiled genealogies linking members to famous leaders of the mythic past, thus boosting their local prestige while perpetuat- ing the ancestral hero’s story. Citizens could point out to visitors where heroes such as Heracles (Hercules), Orestes, or Oedipus had slain monsters, had died, or were bur- ied. Whereas some tales remained of purely local interest, many others, spread abroad by sailors, traveling merchants, and itinerant poets, eventually became part of the national tradition. Stories of gods serving similar functions and heroes performing similar feats commonly merged, as when the myth about Heracles gradually incor- porated the stories of innumerable strongmen. Only by slow degrees were Heracles’ labors fixed at twelve—a popular number in Greek mythology, as well as in the Judeo-Christian Bible—and only over long spans of time were the identities, attri- butes, and number of the twelve Olympians also agreed on. The form in which Greek myth comes to us is thus the end result of a long evolutionary process. Myths are categorized as traditional tales because they are passed on from one generation to the next as part of a particular people’s cultural legacy. They are pre- served and transmitted over time because they are seen as meaningful to the society that transmits them, helping to express a community’s distinctive view of the world, its values and its goals. Although no universally accepted definition of myth exists, Walter Burkert provides a useful generalization: a myth is “a traditional tale with secondary, partial reference to something of collective importance” (see Burkert in the Recommended Reading at the end of this chapter)."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Myth, Legend, Folklore, and Saga Scholars do not agree on the precise definitions of myth, legend, folklore, and saga, or on the precise distinctions between them. Some scholars argue that attempts to differentiate between myth and other categories of traditional tales are misleading and that all nonhistorical (fictional) Greek narratives should be classed as myths. Others use folklore as the more comprehensive term, viewing it as encompassing the totality of traditionally derived and orally transmitted literature. Many critics, however, believe that it is possible—and helpful—to suggest more precise defini- tions, that the different terms represent closely related but separate categories. Given the lack of consensus, proposed definitions must be regarded as tentative, mere starting points for a study of traditional material and inevitably subject to debate and revision. Most current definitions of myth (Greek, rnythoh are extremely general, such as Walter Burkett s proposal that it is a “traditional tale,” a story passed on from gen- eration to generation, that, as a secondary component, had a “collective impor- tance” to the life of the community that preserved and transmitted it. Whereas myths typically originate orally during a preliterate period, Greek myth is primarily literary, surviving in written works of great artistry, such as the epics of Homer and the tragedies of Sophocles. Some Greek tales are often characterized as “divine myths,” stories dealing with creation, the birth of the gods, and the relationship between divinity and humanity. Other myths focus on the deeds of mortal heroes and heroines, presenting human models of courage to be imitated or examples of wrongdoing to be avoided. Both types commonly function to express social values, norms of behavior, and/or the consequences of deviating from them. (For a discus- sion of different methods scholars use to interpret myth, see Chapter 2.) The term legend is variously defined, with some critics using it to denote stories about humans, such as Jasons quest for the Golden Fleece, and others restricting its use to denote traditional tales that have some basis, however tenuous, in histori- cal events. If the Mycenaean Greeks did lay siege to Troy, stories about the war may be legendary rather than strictly mythical. Collections of narratives about a particu- lar enterprise, city, or family, such as the numerous interconnected tales about Troy, Thebes, or Argos and their ruling dynasties, are called sagas. A term originally used to describe Scandinavian tales dating from the twelfth through the fifteenth centu- ries A.D., saga typically refers to long, detailed narratives involving both gods and heroes that mix together historical and fictional elements. Whereas legends and sagas commonly recount the exploits of a military aristocracy (a Greek term refer- ring to government by the “best people”), folktales relate the activities of more humble persons. In contrast to myths, which feature major gods of sky and earth and which place heroes at a particular time or location, such as the Greek assault on Troy, folktales deal with lesser figures of popular imagination, such as witches, elves, giants, and fairies. Folklore, as the word implies, concerns the experiences of common folk in a vague, undefined era—fairy tales usually begin with “Once upon a time” or “In a kingdom far away”—and ordinarily does not include myth’s characteristic preoccupation with the human spirit struggling against the limits of its own mortality. Some literary works based on myth, such as the Odyssey, also contain elements of folklore—-giant cannibals, sorceresses, magic spells, and as- sorted half-human monsters—as do tales of dragon-slaying heroes like Perseus."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"12 The Nature and Funetion of Myth In the Greek city-state, myth’s “collective importance”—its pervasive role in the communal life of the polis—was demonstrated by the prominence given myth at public festivals. Greek festivals were religious celebrations in which the community expressed its beliefs about the gods both through observance of religious rites and by having poets recite time-honored stories about the Olympians and their relationship with humanity. Among its many religious holidays, Athens held two annual festi- vals— the Panathenaea, honoring Athene, and the City Dionysia, honoring Diony- sus— that featured the public performance of myths—events at which Athenians assembled to share a common mythological heritage. The stories about gods and heroes performed at these two festivals were eventually written down, preserving our two principal sources of Greek myth—the epic poems of Homer and the tragic dra- mas of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. Because these writers took their people’s traditional tales about gods and heroes as their primary subject matter, Greek myth is preserved chiefly in works of highly sophisticated literature. Individual mythic scenes are preserved in Greek sculpture and vase painting, an important part of myth’s legacy, but only in literary form do complete stories survive. The Panathenaea At the Panathenaea, held every July to celebrate Athene’s birth, professional reciters of poetry, the rhapsodes, declaimed Homer’s long narratives about the Trojan War (the Iliad) and a war hero’s arduous quest to return home (the Odyssey). Although the Homeric epics were composed and transmitted orally for an extended period (beginning about 750 B.C.), they were committed to writing no later than the sixth century B.C. (See Chapter 11 for a discussion of scholarly theories about Homeric authorship and the oral formulation of the epics.) The Iliad and the Odyssey, which many critics regard as the foundation literature of Western civilization, exerted a wide and enduring influence throughout Greece. The Homeric epics were panhellenic, belonging to all Hellas (the Greeks’ name for their country), an indispensable part of the national heritage. To an incalculable extent, they defined Greek concepts of both divinity and human heroism. According to Herodotus, a Greek historian (c. 450 B.C.), it was Homer and Hesiod, another eighth-century B.C. epic poet, who definitively fixed popular ideas about the gods’ individual personalities, physical appearance, and functions {Histories, Book 2, Section 55). Even while allowing for Herodotus’s rhetorical exaggeration, the Homeric epics indisputably provided the Greeks with their most persuasive models of heroic behavior and the interaction of gods and mortals. In the education of Greek boys, Homer’s epics constituted the chief textbook. Myths about the Homeric deities belonged to all the many city-states of Greece, but they could also be adapted to serve the interests of a particular polis. In adorning the Parthenon, Phidias combined portraits of the Homeric gods with scenes from his own city’s unique festival, the Panathenaea, emphasizing Athene’s special connection with Athens. Every fourth year, at the Great Panathenaea, celebrations were especially elaborate: besides extended recitations of the Iliad and the Odyssey, there were horse races, athletic games, and musical contests. The festivities climaxed in a solemn pro- cession of Athens’s leading citizens, allies, and visiting dignitaries across the agora (marketplace) and up the steep hill of the Acropolis, on which Athene’s temple"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Introduction to Greek Myth 13 Pediment FIGURE 1-6 The Location of the Sculptures on the Parthenon.

Phidias made this ritual procession the subject of the Parthenon frieze, a long band of low-relief sculptures running horizontally along the top of the walls inside the temple’s exterior colonnade (Figure 1-6).

Like the Parthenon itself, the peplos was decorated with mythic motifs featuring Athene’s triumphs—in this case, her defeat of the giants who had dared to attack Olympus (see Chapter 3). Other architectural sculptures of the Parthenon represent similar victories of civilization over savagery: a band of Lapiths, mountain tribesmen in Thessaly, overcome centaurs, male figures whose bestial nature is indicated by their horselike anatomy from the waist down (Figure 1-8).

Looking much as Homer describes them, the Olympian gods are assembled to observe the Panathenaean games, savor the fragrance of burnt-animal sacrifices, and offer favored humans the comfort of their presence and protection. Like all the Par- thenon sculptures and friezes, Phidias’s representation of Homeric divinities illus- trates the close bond between myth and Greek society. The rituals of the Panathe- naea, as well as the art and architecture of the Parthenon, serve multiple religious, social, and political purposes. Athene’s preeminence among the gods and her unique link to Athens are consciously exploited to affirm the Athenians’ identity as a divinely favored people and to validate both their distinctive customs and their right militarily to dominate less powerful Greek states. The City Dionysia The narrative poems of Homer and Hesiod, our oldest extant source of Greek myth, were composed during the Archaic period of Greek history (c. 800-480 B.C.). Some historians bracket the Archaic period by two epochal events: the founding of the Olympic Games in 776 B.C. and Greece’s successful conclusion of the Persian Wars in 479 B.c. (see Chapter 13). The tragedies produced at the City Dionysia, the sec- ond major source of Greek myth, date from the Classical period, the epoch of phe- nomenal creativity that extends from 479 B.C., when the Greeks drove Persia’s invad- ing armies from their shores, to 323 B.C., the year in which Alexander the Great died. The period following Alexander’s death is known as the Hellenistic, an era charac- terized by the synthesis of classic Hellenic and older Near Eastern cultures. Of the hundreds of plays staged at the theater of Dionysus in Athens during the fifth and fourth centuries B.C., only about thirty-three tragedies and eleven comedies survive. The publicly sponsored performance of plays was the highlight of the City Dionysia, a lavish annual festival established or greatly augmented by the Athenian leader Pisistratus about 534 B.C. Of the scores of playwrights who competed to have their works produced, only seven tragedies each by Aeschylus and Sophocles and nineteen by Euripides, and eleven comedies by Aristophanes, have escaped the oblivion of time. Like the narrative poets, the Greek dramatists who composed scripts for Dionysus’s wine festival took myth as their primary subject, freely revising tradi- tional stories for dramatic effect and adapting mythic themes to suit the sophisticated audiences of classical Athens. In his discussion of Greek poetry, the philosopher Aristotle (384-322 B.C.) gives myth {mythos) a peculiarly literary meaning, using it to denote the plot, the careful structuring of incidents to achieve a climactic action in a literary work. As do the Homeric epics, classical dramas typically involve conflicts between major charac- ters— such as that between Agamemnon, his murderous wife, Clytemnestra, and their son, Orestes, in Aeschylus’s Oresteia, which rises to a decisive crisis or climax and which is then ultimately resolved through some kind of accommodation or rec- onciliation. At the conclusion of the Oresteia, for example, Athene intervenes to rec- oncile the Furies, spirits of blood vengeance, with a new form of civilized justice, the legal court system. (See Chapter 13 for discussions of Dionysian ritual and its rela- tionship to Greek drama; Chapter 15 includes the Oresteia.)"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"18 The Nature and Function of Myth Other Literary Sources In addition to our two main sources of Greek myth—archaic narrative poetry, such as Homer’s Iliad and Hesiod’s Theogony, and classical dramas by Athenian play- wrights— Greek authors employed other literary genres in which myth is the chief topic. Writing in imitation of Homer, several (generally) anonymous poets later com- posed a series of hymns praising the twelve Olympians. Known collectively as the Homeric Hymns, they preserve important myths about the mother goddess Demeter, her daughter Persephone, the volatile Dionysus, the cunning Hermes, and the lumi- nescent Apollo (see Chapters 4, 5, 7, and 8). These hymns, which vary considerably in length, were recited at festivals as prologues to the performance of the longer epics. Some Greek lyric poets, such as Stesichorus (sixth century B.C.), who wrote a narra- tive version of the Oresteia, and Pindar (c. 518-446 B.C.), who included numerous allusions to myth in his odes praising victorious athletes, regularly incorporated myths into their work. Of Greek epic poetry after Homer, only the Voyage of the Argo (Argonautica) by Apollonius of Rhodes (c. 295—215 B.C.) survives intact, preserving the story of Ja- son’s quest for the Golden Fleece (see Chapter 17). Interestingly, the most compre- hensive collection of Greek myths is not a literary composition by a major poet, but a prosaic anthology of stories misnamed the Library of Apollo dorus. Although this compendium of traditional tales is attributed to Apollodorus of Athens (c. 140 B.C.), scholars believe that it was actually compiled by an unknown hand two or three centuries later. The Library may have been intended as a sourcebook to aid Greek schoolchildren in learning the ancient myths. Despite its lack of artistic flair, the Library is exceptionally valuable: arranging the myths in a generally chronological order, it begins with a creation story that largely parallels Hesiod’s Theogony and narrates a wide range of heroic adventures, including those of such diverse figures as Bellerophon, Perseus, and Heracles. (See the discussion of heroes and heroines in Ghapter 10.) The Library closes with the fall of Troy, traditionally regarded as the final great event in Greece’s mythic past. As an epilogue to the Homeric poems, the writer adds fascinating details about the aftermath of the Trojan War, recounting the death of Odysseus. To the Greeks, the children of the warriors who had fought at Troy, such as Odysseus’s son Telemachus and Agamemnon’s son Orestes, consti- tuted the last generation of heroes, their lives the final chapter in Greece’s mythic past. After the last heroes had died, the world changed forever; never again did Zeus father human sons and daughters, leaving humankind to cope without divinely be- gotten leaders. Although the Library was probably written in the late first or early second cen- tury A.D., approximately thirteen hundred years after the traditional date of the Greek assault on Troy, this compendium is believed to contain versions of some myths that are much older than the time of their written composition. Unlike the poets, who were interested in reshaping the myths for their own artistic purposes, the Library^ unknown author was chiefly interested in preserving them unchanged for posterity. Pausanias, who wrote a Guide to Greece late in the second century A.D., was simi- larly concerned with recording ancient traditions.

His detailed report provides insight into the varying beliefs, rites, and customs prevailing in different parts of late classical Greece. At a slightly earlier date, the Greek historian and biographer Plutarch (c. A.D. 46- 120), best known for his Parallel Lives of eminent Greek and Roman leaders, re- corded a number of local myths, particularly those of his native province Boeotia and nearby Delphi, where he served as a priest of Apollo. Plutarch explores some popular beliefs not usually addressed by the great poets in his “On the Cessation of Oracles,” which contains a discussion of demons {daimones), invisible beings intermediate be- tween gods and men. Distinctive Qualities of Greek Literary Myth Poets writing in the three major literary categories in which Greek mythology sur- vives— epic narratives, lyric poetry, and tragic drama—imbue the myths with several distinctive qualities. Besides promoting such traits as anthropomorphism and a con- sistent emphasis on family dynamics, Greek authors transmit a mythology that is also characterized by humanism, individualism, competitiveness, and a modified pessi- mism based on the Greek poets’ keen awareness of human mortality. Humanism In contrast to many other mythologies of antiquity, the majority of Greek myths ultimately focus on human heroes, a fact the Greeks themselves noted. Divine beings are important in most heroic tales, but their presence is typically intermittent and their influence indirect. Gods may operate invisibly behind the scenes, but it isAhe heroes’ personal struggles and suffering that occupy the foreground. Greek myth con- sistently expresses an anthropocentric (human-centered) cosmos. A worldview that places human consciousness squarely at the center of the universe, humanism asserts the intrinsic worth, dignity, and creative potential of the individual human being. “Man is the measure of all things,” according to the fifth-century B.C. philosopher Protagoras, and it is human perception—guided by logic and moral principle—that defines the nature of reality. The human element is so fundamental to the Greek perspective that Hesiod’s Theogony contains no reference to man’s creation, perhaps because the poet could not conceive of a world without men — though he easily imag- ines one without women. Although Hesiod does not include an account of human origins in the Theogony, he does allude to a tradition that godyjiidL humans have a “common descent”—all derive ultimately from Gaea, Mother Earth. In addition to claiming a shared ancestry for gods and men, Pindar goes even further in asserting the divine-human affinity: in intellect and physical skill, men^can perform deeds worthy of gods! Single is the race, single Of men and gods; From a single Mother [Gaea] we both draw breath. But a difference in power in everything keeps us apart; For one is nothing, but the brazen sky Stays a fixed habitation for ever."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"20 The Nature and Function of Myth Yet we can in greatness of mind Or of body be like the immortals. —NEMEAN VI, The Odes of Pindar, trans. C. M. Bowra The poets’ insistence that, through creative thought and heroic action, men can compete with gods, coupled with a grim awareness that even the greatest human accomplishments are eventually nullified by death, produces an almost painful ten- sion in Greek myth. Greek humanism, particularly during the Classical period, ex- alted human achievements, but at the same time maintained a realistic assessment of human frailty. Although humanity’s potential seems almost unlimited and heroic am- bition inspires men to strive with gods, both Homer and the tragic poets unani- mously agree that humans betray a lamentable tendency to overreach and make fatal errors in judgment. Greek poets thus advocate a prudent self-discipline and reverence for the gods, reminding their audiences that implacable forces—fate and the some- times unfathomable divine will—circumscribe human existence. As the example of Oedipus demonstrates, no human, no matter how lofty his status, can avoid fulfilling what the gods have decreed (see Chapter 16). Individualism and Competitiveness While recognizing the paradoxical tension between human assertiveness and human vulnerability, both Archaic and Classical myth emphasize a distinctively Greek focus on competitiveness and individual achievement. The Homeric heroes strive to sur- pass their peers, to attain the_foremost place—as judged by an admiring public—as the bravest, strongest, most skilled, and most eloquent of their leaders. The Homeric warrior, such as Achilles or Ajax, prefers single, hand-to-hand, combat with individual opponents of equal social rank to a mass assault on the enemy in which he might be lost in the crowd. Only in solo confrontations with another aristocratic fighter can he effectively demonstrate his superiority. The career of Achilles, the Iliad\\ leading character, illustrates both the glory and the enormous cost of unrestrained individualism; Achilles recognizes no equals and adamantly refuses to cooperate with his fellow Greek soldiers after Agamemnon un- wisely confiscates his captive slave girl. By seizing Achilles’ concubine, a living trophy of the hero’s valor in battle, Agamemnon calls into question Achilles’ status and rep- utation, subjecting him to public shame. When Hector, Troy’s chief defender, slays Achilles’ beloved Patroclus, Achilles insists on avenging his friend, even though he knows that killing Hector will hasten his own death. The epic hero, represented by Achilles, unhesitatingly sacrifices everything, including life itself, to vindicate his honor and thereby earn undying fame (see Chapter 11). Writers of tragedy similarly concentrate on single heroes caught up in dilemmas that almost invariably bring about their destruction. Whereas the epic hero is typi- cally a man of physical action who proves his worth by demonstrating indomitable courage and fighting skill, the tragic hero, such as Oedipus, explores the meaning of pain and defeat, plumbing depths of thought and feeling typically beyond those that epic warriors express. Greek society routinely institutionalized the principle of individual competition: at virtually every public festival, poets, dancers, athletes, and musicians competed for"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Introduction to Greek Myth 21 prizes that were communal affirmations of their personal worth. Greece’s most cele- brated contests were held at the Olympic Games, which perpetuated the heroic ideal of a single competitor triumphing over all rivals. Awarding only a first prize, the Olympic judges acknowledged no second- or third-best entrants in such sports as foot racing, wrestling, boxing, discus throwing, and chariot racing. The winning ath- lete and the mythic hero, such as Achilles, Odysseus, Oedipus, or Antigone, share a common destiny; they stand alone, willing to risk all in accomplishing feats that will distinguish them qualitatively from all lesser mortals. As the myths never tire of say- ing, this obsessive quest for godlike preeminence is a noble goal, but it inevitably exacts a crushing toll. In the universe postulated by Greek myth, human beings are permanently barred from the divine enjoyment of everlasting life, a condition that threatens to rob in- dividual lives of real meaning (compare Ghapters 9 and 10). According to Homer, even the greatest heroes are condemned to spend eternity in the darkness of the Underworld, where significant action is no longer possible. Given the view that death ends all that makes life valuable, a belief well illustrated in the Homeric account of Odysseus’s journey to the realm of the dead {Odyssey, Book 11), the high-risk environment in which the hero labors makes his efforts to excel all the more remarkable. Seeking his destiny on the battlefield or in other dangerous ventures, the hero finds himself in the paradoxical situation of pursuing immortality into the jaws of death. Dealing with warfare, rage, murder, family strife, sexual aggression, and other acts of violence, many Greek myths are uncompromising in their unflinching insistence on the inevitability of human suffering and ultimate loss. Despite their repeated portrayals of noble heroes defeating evil adversaries, not many contain happy endings. The world of Greek myth thus reflects the tensions, perplexities, and disappoint- ments of Greek society. The gods possess everything that the Greek male desires or admires—eternal youth, unblemished good looks, honor, reputation, irresistible power, and the uninhibited assertion of individual selfhood. For all their superiority to mortals, however, the gods are also driven by the same kinds of competitive am- bition and jealous regard for their prerogatives that ruin the mental peace of human leaders. Worshiping divine beings who were largely projections of their own ideal (and fallible) selves, the Greeks created myths in which the gods are almost as fasci- nated by human activities as their mortal subjects are intrigued by the gods. Vlyth and History For the ancient Greeks, myth was not only a component ol religion, but it also took the role of prehistory, providing traditions about their supposed ancestors in the dis- tant past. In the Greek view, the mythic past included everything from the world’s beginnings to the aftermath of the Trojan War. Having few historical facts about this ancient era, Greek storytellers typically regarded it as an almost magical era, qualita- tively different from their own mundane time. It was an epoch in which gods com- muned freely and openly with human beings, inviting mortals to their feasts and sometimes directly aiding heroes in their endeavors. Gods also interacted sexually with human lovers: mating with mortal women, Zeus sired many of the greatest"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"22 The Nature and Function of Myth heroes and heroines, including Perseus, Heracles, and Helen. The incomparable strength and beauty of the children thus produced was proof of their divine parent- age. Even goddesses occasionally deigned to bestow their love on young men: Thetis, a beautiful sea nymph, bore Achilles to the mortal Peleus; and lovely Aphrodite se- duced the Trojan shepherd-prince Anchises to produce Aeneas, who attained enor- mous prominence in later Roman myth (see the Aeneid 'm Chapter 19). After the sons of heroes who had fought at Troy died, however, the mythic era came to an end and the divine-human relationship changed forever. Zeus and the other Olympians no longer took mortal lovers, thereby precluding a new generation of heroes who could kill lions with their bare hands or descend to the Underworld and return unscathed. Ceasing to appear visibly in human society, the Olympians withdrew permanently to Mount Olympus, thereafter communicating with hu- manity only through dreams, visions, or oracles delivered at prophetic shrines such as Delphi. Most commonly, the gods remained silent or sent highly ambiguous “signs” of their intentions, in the form of the flight of birds, the rustling of leaves in a sacred oak, or the appearance of the entrails of a sacrificial animal. (See Chapter 7 for a discussion of the Delphic Oracle.) In contrast to the Greeks’ view of myth as prehistory, modern scholars hotly de- bate whether myth has any connection with historical fact. Whereas some scholars believe that myth is entirely fiction, albeit fiction that conveys important truths about the nature of human experience, others think that some mythic events, such as the Trojan War, have a basis in actual events. During the nineteenth century, the ama- teur German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann (1822—1890) excavated the tradi- tional site of Troy, near the modern village of Hissarlik in northwestern Turkey. He discovered that the site contained the ruins of a series of Bronze Age settlements, each built atop the rubble of its predecessor. Schliemann concluded that the ruin labeled Troy VII-A was the citadel Homer described in the Iliad. Some later archaeologists argued that Troy VII-A was too puny to fit the Homeric description; however, recent surveys of the site indicate that a slightly earlier city, Troy VI, was much larger and more impressively fortified than Schliemann’s Troy VII-A. Troy VI, with its massive walls, was destroyed and burned about 1270 B.C., whereas Troy VII-A fell about 1190 B.C., when Mycenaean civilization was already in decline (see Figure 1-11). Having “found” Troy, Schliemann next excavated the site of Mycenae [mye-SEE- nee], a late Bronze Age city over which Agamemnon, leader of the Greek forces against Troy, was said to have ruled. (See the map in Figure 1-17.) Schliemann dis- covered that Homer was correct in describing Mycenae as “rich in gold,” for its royal tombs contained superbly crafted metalwork, including gold drinking vessels and gold death masks that had been placed over the faces of deceased kings. Referring to a particularly striking mask, Schliemann incorrectly claimed to have “looked upon the face of Agamemnon” (Figure 1-12), although the object in question was later dated to a period considerably before the Trojan War. Recent studies accuse Schlie- mann of both careless error and outright deception in some of his claims, but his work stimulated other archaeological investigations of prehistoric Greece that have enabled us to understand some of the major developments in Greek history. If future discoveries produce evidence that prehistoric Greeks did indeed capture Troy, the famous war may prove to be legendary rather than purely mythic.

Although many Greek myths may have originated during the Mycenaean era (c. 1600-1100 B.C.), they were not written down until the Archaic period, after the Ho- meric epics were composed. The last great events of Greek mythology concern the war against Troy and the homecomings of heroes such as Agamemnon, king of Mycenae, and Odysseus, king of Ithaca (c. 1250—1200 B.C.).

(See Chapter 3 for a discussion of Near Eastern parallels to Hesiod’s myth of world origins.) Archaeological evidence from Greece and the Aegean Islands indicates that an identifiably Greek culture did not begin to emerge until after the arrival of Indo-Europeans about 2100 B.C.

When the pioneer archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann excavated the circular shaft graves at Mycenae, he found royal entombments that had miraculously escaped the plundering of ancient grave robbers.

Minoan Civilization Long before the Indo-Europeans arrived in the region of Greece, a people of un- known origins had already created a highly sophisticated culture centered on the island of Crete (see Figure 1-17). Characterized by the building of huge palace com- plexes decorated with colorful wall paintings, Cretan society developed during the Early and Middle Bronze Ages (c. 3000—1600 B.C.). When Sir Arthur Evans (1851— 1941), a British archaeologist, excavated Cretan sites during the early twentieth cen- tury, he named the rediscovered culture the Minoan [Mih-NOH-an], after Minos [MYE-nohs], a mythical king who was said to have reigned at Knossos, the largest of Crete’s giant palaces. Evans, who partly restored some of Knossos’s grand courtyards, broad stairways, painted colonnades, and brilliant frescoes (Figure 1-13), found that the Minoans had achieved a remarkable level of both artistic and technological de- velopment.

The beauty and elegance characterizing aristocratic life at the Minoan royal palaces are evident in this fresco from Knossos. A vast multistory structure extending over many acres, the Knossos palace was excavated by Sir Arthur Evans in the early twentieth century. (ArchaeologicalMuseum, Heraklion, Crete) they equipped Knossos with indoor plumbing and flush toilets, a combination of domestic elegance and convenience not matched again until the age of imperial Rome. The fact that Minoan palaces were not fortifled also suggests that this luxury- loving people controlled the surrounding seas and did not fear enemy invasion. For many centuries, Minoan culture dominated the Aegean, including settlements on Thera (modern Santorini), a volcanic island about sixty miles north of Crete. About 1628 B.C., the Thera volcano produced one of the region’s largest eruptions since the Ice Age ended approximately ten thousand years earlier. The eruption bur- ied a coastal town, named for the nearby modern village of Akrotiri, that has now been partly excavated. Like the Minoan palaces on Crete, this Bronze Age seaport boasted paved streets, an elaborate water supply and sewage system, indoor plumbing, and superb frescoes, including paintings of an urban waterfront and a naval fleet. Some historians believe that Plato’s famous tale of Atlantis, an advanced civilization that supposedly disappeared overnight during a great natural disaster, may be based on dim memories of the catastrophic eruption of Thera. In the 1960s, some archae- ologists theorized that the Thera disaster, which probably triggered giant sea waves known as tsunamis, may have wrecked the Minoan naval fleet and destroyed many low-lying coastal settlements, paving the way for mainland invaders to seize control of Crete. Because the destruction of the Minoan palaces occurred almost two centu- ries after the great eruption, however, historians have concluded that Thera was not responsible for the demise of Minoan civilization. At present, only the equivalent of three city blocks of ancient Akrotiri have been uncovered from their thick shroud of volcanic ash; it is likely that many more artifacts that will illuminate this pre-Greek culture still await discovery."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"26 The Nature and Function of Myth FIGURE 1-14 The Minoan “Bull Dance.” This fresco from the Minoan palace at Knossos shows young women (white figures) and a young man (brown figure) participating in an ap- parently death-defying ritual involving a Cretan bull. Such rites may have given rise to the myth of the flesh-devouring Minotaur, half-man and half-bull. Bull horns carved in stone formed a dominant architectural motif at Knossos, suggesting that for the Minoans the bull represented a divine force. In Greek myth, Poseidon, god of the sea (over which the Minoans ruled), is represented by a bull. Poseidon also caused of earthquakes, which sporadically dev- astated Crete and other parts of the Aegean. (ArchaeologicalMuseum, Heraklion, Crete) Both the Minoan and other Aegean Island cultures appear to have worshiped the feminine principle of divinity. Although no written texts dating from Minoan times have yet been deciphered, an abundance of female figurines and other cult objects associated with the earth, fertility, and regeneration indicate that the “Great Goddess” was central to Minoan and other Aegean religions (see Ghapter 4). The bull, a symbol of divine strength, was also prominently featured in Minoan art (Fig- ure 1-14). Mycenaean Civilization When Indo-Europeans arrived in Greece near the close of the third millennium B.C., they brought with them not only horses and an aggressive warrior mentality but also the worship of a male sky god. Zeus, head of the Greek pantheon (roster of officially recognized deities), is a direct descendant of the Indo-European concept of masculine divinity (Figure 1-15). Zeus denotes the clear, luminous daylight sky; his name cor- responds to the ancient celestial deity of ancient India, Dyaus pitar (in Greek, Zeu pater). In Roman myth, he is Jupiter {Diespiter, or “God [Zeus] the father”). The same root appears in the Latin deus (“god”) and dies (“day”) and the Greek eudia (“fair weather”), indicating Zeus’s association with the bright light of day. In Fdomer’s famous phrase, Zeus is also “the cloud-gatherer,” the awesome power that generates storms, a function the Greeks also recognized in another of Zeus’s epithets, Ombrios, “bringer of rain.” Borrowing heavily from the earlier Minoan culture, Indo-Europeans speaking an early form of Greek established a series of fortified cities on the Greek mainland, including Mycenae, after which archaeologists have named the Mycenaean civiliza-"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Introduction to Greek Myth 27 FIGURE 1-15 Bronze Statue of Zeus [or Poseidon] (c. 460 B.C.).

Whereas the Minoans had constructed enormous palaces without fortifications, the Mycenaeans surrounded their hilltop settlements with massive defensive walls (Figure 1-16). They also appear to have worshiped a number of gods later included in the Greek pantheon. Mycenaean texts, a form of writing known as Linear B, reveal several familiar names, including Zeus and Hera (who are linked), Poseidon, Artemis, Athene, Hermes, and Ares. Even Dionysus is mentioned, although some myths suggest that he was an import from Asia, a late arrival on the Greek scene (see Chapter 8). Some Linear B passages feature dedications to “all the gods,” indicating a substantial number of recognized deities during the Mycenaean era, perhaps forerunners of the Olympian family. In his Mycenaean Origin of Greek Mythology, Martin P. Nilsson argued that Greek myth assumed its distinctive qualities during the Mycenaean period. Noting that many of the Homeric and other mythical heroes are associated with specific Myce- naean cities—Agamemnon and Orestes with Mycenae, Heracles with Tiryns, Nestor with Pylos, Oedipus with Thebes—Nilsson concluded that Homer, Hesiod, and other early poets drew on oral traditions from the Mycenaean era in creating their later versions of the myths.

As much of Greece was gradually occupied by a people speaking a Dorian dialect, refu- gees from the older Mycenaean centers migrated from the mainland eastward across the Aegean Sea to settle along the coast of Ionia, in what is now western Turkey. The Archaic and Classical Periods As the prosperity and material culture of these Ionian settlements gradually im- proved—largely through sea trade and interaction with the commercial centers of Asia Minor—a new and distinctively Greek civilization began to emerge at Ionian cities such as Miletus, Smyrna, and Halicarnassus. During the Archaic period (c. 800 — 480 B.C.), Greece was reborn as a network of hundreds of city-states scattered from Ionia in the eastern Aegean to Sicily and southern Italy in the west (Figure 1-17).

Following Greek victories during Persia’s two invasions of Greece (490 and 480 — 479 B.C.), Athens formed a confederacy of Greek states, the Delian League, and assumed political leadership of Greece. During the half century after the Persian Wars, Athens celebrated its political power in an outburst of creative activity in works of art, architecture, history, philosophy, and drama. Even after it was militarily de- feated by Sparta (with Persian aid) at the end of the Peloponnesian Wars (431- 404 B.C.), Athens continued to be, as the Athenian leader Pericles had once stated, a “school for all Hellas,” producing sculpture, painting, and literature that established standards of excellence for later generations. Because Greek myth is preserved in works of literature—epics, lyric poetry, and dramas—that stand as models of artistic achievement, it is known as classical, both the fountainhead and the inspiration of the West’s subsequent creative impulses. Roman Mythology Although classical mythology is essentially Greek myth, the Romans also contributed extensively to the field. Ovid, a leading Roman poet during the reign of Augustus (27 B.c.-A.D. 14), created the single most important collection of Greco-Roman tales—the Metamorphoses of the Gods. Ovid’s stories about gods and heroes changing their physical forms, undergoing a metamorphosis, were designed to suit Roman tastes, however, and differ considerably in tone and style from most Greek myths. The Romans borrowed most of their myths from Greek sources, but they typically revised and transformed them to highlight distinctively Roman social and political concerns. Because Roman poets such as Ovid and Virgil, author of the Aeneid, pro- duced their work at a much later historical period than the Greeks, and for a much different audience, Roman mythology is discussed in a separate section (Part 4, Chap- ters 18-20). Some readers may find it instructive to compare the Greek creation myth in Hesiod’s Theogony (see Chapter 3) with the later, much more sophisticated account in Ovid’s Metamorphoses (see Chapter 20), recognizing that Ovid wrote ap- proximately seven hundred and fifty years after Hesiod and inhabited an entirely different thought world.

By contrast, modern scholars try to define the precise nature and purpose of myth, advancing numerous theories to explain its origin and functions. Some theorists argue that myths are largely pre- scientific responses to the external world of nature or social institutions. Ex- ternalist theories suggest that myths were designed to provide imaginative causes for natural phenomena, such as the cycle of day and night or the recurrence of the seasons; to give meaning to commonly observed rituals, such as religious sacrifices or initiation rites; or retroactively to justify social practices or institutions whose actual origins had been forgotten. Internalist theories propose that myth is a spontaneous product of the human mind, operating to express typically unconscious fears or desires, to chart the dif- ficulties of psychological maturation, or to mediate the contrarieties of existence. Ancient Ways o Viewing Myth Archaic Views Most ancient Greeks seem to have accepted their myths uncritically, as venerable traditions that preserved generally reliable accounts of the world’s origins, the nature of divinity, and the way things were in the extremely distant past. Besides substituting for ancient history and theology in popular Greek imagination, myth also offered examples of heroic action that promoted standards of courage and leadership for the ruling classes. After about 600 B.C., however, the rise of philosophy, with its use of reason and observation to interpret the world without dependence on inherited be- 34"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Ways of Interpreting Myth 35 liefs, produced thinkers who could be acutely critical of Homer’s portrayal of the gods. Xenophanes, a writer who lived about two hundred years after Homer in the town of Colophon in Ionia (now western Turkey), was among the hrst to attack the Homeric gods as ethically deficient—guilty of theft, adultery, vindictiveness, and other acts that would shame most humans. Aware that a society’s gods mirror the virtues and defects of the people who worship them, Xenophanes called attention to the Greeks’ tendency to fashion gods in their own image. 1 Man made his gods, and furnished them with his own body, voice and garments. 2 If a horse or lion or a slow ox had agile hands for paint and sculpture, the horse would make his god a horse, the ox would sculpt an ox. 3 Our gods have flat noses and black skins say the Ethiopians. The Thracians say our gods have red hair and hazel eyes. —Greek Lyric Poetry, trans. Willis Barnstone, p. 131 While rejecting myth’s anthropomorphic gods as naive and morally objectionable, Xenophanes proposed that there exists a single, unknowable deity who informs and governs the universe by thought alone. There is one God—supreme among gods and men— who is like mortals in neither body nor mind. —Greek Lyric Poetry, trans. Willis Barnstone, p. 130 Although Xenophanes is sometimes regarded as the earliest Greek monotheist, some scholars believe that he was instead formulating a notion of cosmic unity and har- mony that encompassed all divinity. Another Archaic poet, Theagenes (c. 525 B.C.), agreed that a literal reading of Homeric myth was ethically unacceptable, but he suggested a method of interpreta- tion by which the Greeks could retain their mythic heritage and also make it morally respectable. Theagenes, who lived in southern Italy, was allegedly the first to view the Iliad and Odyssey as allegories—narratives that are not to be read at face value, but that function metaphorically. In an allegory, all characters, places, and actions are symbols of something other than what they appear to be. According to Theagenes, who incorporated ideas from early Greek science into his allegorical reading of Ho- mer, the gods fighting against one another in the Trojan War represent not real deities but natural phenomena. Thus, when Apollo or Helios battle Poseidon or Troy’s river god Scamander, the conflict actually signifies celestial fire opposing its cosmic oppo- site, water. Similarly, Artemis represents the moon, and Hera the air. In Theagenes’ view, the gods can also symbolize human qualities or dispositions: Aphrodite is desire; Ares, insanity; and Athene, intelligence."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"36 The Nature and Function of Myth Classical Views The philosopher Anaxagoras (c. 500-428 B.C.) also avoided taking a literal view of myths that, at first blush, seem to present the gods behaving badly. In the Homeric tradition, Hermes steals Apollo’s cattle; Zeus rapes the virgin lo; Ares seduces He- phaestus’s wife. Aphrodite; and Hera persecutes her husband’s innocent (although typically illegitimate) children. The list of divine misdemeanors is almost endless. Adopting Theagenes’ allegorical approach to resolve the ethical dilemma, Anaxag- oras contended that the Homeric epics were really intended to expose the evil results of wrongdoing and thereby to teach virtue. Myth’s use of miraculous or otherwise “incredible” events also caused problems for many Greek intellectuals, who typically attempted to rationalize mythic “impos- sibilities.” With few exceptions, most classical authors exploited the tools of philo- sophical reasoning only to explain away unrealistic aspects of old traditions. They did not question the existence of their gods, merely the way the poets presented them. In his play the Bacchae, Euripides has the prophet Tiresias correct a popular misconcep- tion about Dionysus’s birth from the thigh of Zeus: the mistaken view that Zeus literally carried Dionysus in his body after saving the embryo from a fire consuming the child’s mother, Semele, results from the careless confusion of similar words. Zeus did not stitch the unborn child into his thigh (Greek, meron)\\ instead, Tiresias says, he rescued the infant from Hera’s jealous wrath by hiding him away and making, out of bright air, a replica of Dionysus’s body, and then giving this false image to Hera as a hostage {homeron; Figure 2-1). Euripides’ ingenious wordplay thus purges the myth of its irrational content while retaining the supernatural aspect of the story, a typical mode of classical interpretation. Some classical philosophers, notably the Athenian Socrates (c. 469-399 B.C.) and his disciple Plato (427-347 B.C.), were particularly offended by the poor moral ex- ample the Olympians set, objecting to such tales as Uranus’s castration by his son Cronus, the father of Zeus, or to those about Zeus’s countless adulteries. Insisting that the gods must be viewed as entirely good and free of human passion, Plato banned Homeric myth from his ideal republic. Despite his aversion to poetic fictions, however, Plato himself freely revised selected myths to illustrate his teachings about an invisible spirit realm to which the soul returns after death (see Chapter 9). A Hellenistic Theory About two generations after Plato, Euhemerus of Messene proposed a revolutionary theory about the origin of the Greek gods. In a fictional travel story. Sacred Scripture {Hiera anagraphe, c. 300 B.C.), Euhemerus described an imaginary island, Panchaia, that he claim.ed to have visited in the Indian Ocean. According to this fictional ac- count, the islanders had erected a golden column inscribed with lists of prehistoric human kings, including such rulers as Uranus, Cronus, and Zeus! According to Eu- hemerus’s startling interpretation, this column provided written evidence that the Homeric gods were originally mortal, ancient leaders who had been posthumously elevated to divine status. Known as Euhemerism, this view holds that Greek concepts about the gods derive from the postmortem deification of otherwise forgotten mor-"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Ways of Interpreting Myth 37 FIGURE 2-1 The Birth of Dionysus from the Thigh of Zeus. In this bas-relief, the new- born Dionysus emerges from his father s lap and reaches out to Hermes, who prepares to wrap the infant in swaddling clothes. Whereas a few educated Greeks, such as the playwright Eu- ripides and the philosopher Plato, tried to rationalize myth to make it seem more plausible, none seem to have questioned its fundamental relation to supposedly historical events in the distant past. Viewing myth as a purely imaginary creation—perhaps invented to express in- sights about physical nature, social institutions, or human psychology—is a modern, post- Enlightenment development. (Vatican Museums, Rome) tals. Euhemerism had a strong impact on the Hellenistic world, where successors to Alexander the Great were claiming divine honors, a practice later adopted by some Roman emperors. Some Modern Interpretations o f Myth Despite Euhemerus’s shocking assertion, however, or an occasional philosopher’s re- jection of its more brutal aspects, myth generally kept its hold on Greco-Roman society until the Roman government’s legitimization of Christianity as the official state religion in the fourth century A.D. Denounced by the Christian Church as being opposed to the true faith, classical mythology was largely devalued in Western culture during the Middle Ages. Although medieval theologians commonly identified Greek deities with demons, the rebirth of classical learning during the European Renais- sance reintroduced myth to the world of art, literature, and scholarship. The devel- opment of modern scientific methodology during the Enlightenment (eighteenth century A.D.), with its emphasis on reason, objectivity, classification, and analysis, eventually inspired a renewed scholarly interest in myth. During the past two centu- ries, scholars have applied techniques from a variety of academic disciplines—includ- ing anthropology, cultural history, psychology, sociology, and religious studies—to studying myth and interpreting its significance. M}'thology has two general meanings. It can be defined as a set or system of myths, such as the vast collection of Greek and Roman tales known as classical my- thology. It also refers to a methodological analysis of myths, particularly their form."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"38 The Nature and Funetion of Myth purpose, and function. In trying to isolate some theme or principle that all myths have in common, scholars have produced numerous theories that claim to provide the correct key for understanding the precise nature of myth. Although no one theory or definition of myth has yet won universal acceptance, scholarly attempts to break myths down into their component parts and discover some unifying element behind their almost infinite variety have greatly increased our knowledge of what myths are and what they are not. Most scholarly theories fit into one of two broad categories: those that assume an external basis, such as a reaction to physical nature, for the creation of myth; and those that see mythmaking as spontaneous and internal, an instinctive expression of the human mind. Externalist Theories: Myth as a Product of the Environment The “externalists” typically view myth as a prescientific attempt to explain natural phenomena or to provide justifications for social, religious, or political customs or institutions. These theories generally view myth as a quasi-rational response to the physical or social environment. Nature Myths One of the first modern efforts to fashion a comprehensive theory of myth was, in fact, anticipated by Theagenes’ argument that mythic characters and actions are really disguised representations of natural processes. The nature myth theory holds that myth is essentially a reaction to the awe-inspiring power of physical nature, particularly those phenomena that directly affect human life: the continuing cycles of day and night, sunshine and darkness, summer and winter, heat and cold, fair weather and storm, rainfall and drought, plant life and death. Even casual readers will immediately recognize that many Greek tales personify (give human traits to) solar, atmospheric, meteorological, or other natural processes. Zeus, who gathers storm clouds, detonates thunder, and hurls lightning bolts, is clearly a personification of meteorological forces. His brother Poseidon is lord of the sea and earthquakes, a volatile manifestation of natural energy that makes both sea and land violently roll and pitch, with potentially disastrous consequences for mortals. Some of the older gods, whom the Greeks believed preceded the Olympians in time, are directly identified with astronomical objects or functions. The Titan Hy- perion [hye-PEER-ee-uhn] (or his son Helios [HEE-lee-ohs]) is the sun, and Selene [se-LEE-nee] is the moon that typically rises as the sun sets—a cycle depicted at the corners of the Parthenon’s east pediment to frame the central scene of Athene’s birth (see Figures 3-1 and 3-2). Eos [EE-ohs], whom Homer calls “rosy-fingered” and whom the Romans named Aurora [ah-ROR-uh], personifies the dawn. A few myths about Apollo, who in later traditions assumes Hyperion’s duties as the sun god, illus- trate solar movement, signified by Apollo’s fiery chariot making its daily journey across the sky. Scholars advocating the nature myth theory—such as the nineteenth-century philologist F. Max Muller (1823-1900), whose work helped popularize the con- cept— rigorously applied their view to the entire range of myth. If a particular myth’s relation to natural phenomena was not immediately obvious, it was interpreted alle- gorically to make it fit the theory. According to Muller and others of his school, the"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Ways of Interpreting Myth 39 Greeks used mythic figures and events to symbolize the tensions, oppositions, and seasonal changes in nature, such as the anxiety-producing alternation of flood and aridity that so profoundly affected the human activities of sovv^ing, growing, and har- vesting and on which the human community depended to survive. Interpreting all myths as ingeniously disguised representations of natural phe- nomena, the nature theory fails to account for the full content of most myths. Zeus is undeniably a weather god, but he is also the champion of justice, hospitality, and legitimate kingship; defining him only as a personification of atmospheric turbulence explains none of his higher ethical functions. Artemis is commonly identified with the moon, but that does not explain her role as patron of childbirth and guardian of wildlife. Nor does regarding Dionysus, god of the vine, as merely an embodiment of the vegetative life cycle adequately explain his role as liberator of the human psyche. Myth and Ritual A more persistent and influential theory associates myth exclu- sively with ritual, a religious or quasi-religious ceremony in which a prescribed series of actions—accompanied by the repetition of traditional phrases—are scrupulously observed. At the annual festival of Dionysus in Athens, a ritual parade included rep- resentations of the god’s mythic birth and death, as well as traditional songs and dances out of which Athenian tragedy is said to have developed. According to the ritualist view, promoted by several leading scholars at Cambridge University during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, myths are the by-product of such ritual enactments as those performed at Dionysian celebrations. They are stories invented to explain ceremonies whose real origins have long been forgotten. In his multivolume compendium of European myth. The Golden Bough (1890-1915), the English anthropologist Sir James Erazer (1854-1941) provided numerous ex- amples from European folk rituals to illustrate the close bond between myth and ancient rites, particularly those that evoked plant, animal, and human fertility. Among others, Robert Graves, an English poet and critic, maintained that myths derive from mimes, dances, and other performances given at public festivals. The Cambridge school, which included such distinguished critics as Jane Harrison and Gilbert Mur- ray, argued that even supposedly sophisticated Greek myths were based on primitive, irrational customs. Stories of Heracles’ famous labors and his later ascension to heaven were alleged to derive from oral recitations made at his purported tomb. In some cases, such as the tale of Demeter and Persephone, there is a close corre- lation between ritual and myth. At Eleusis, a town about twelve miles northwest of Athens, celebrants reenacted the ancient story of Demeter’s search for her young daughter, Persephone, who, unknown to her grieving mother, had been abducted by Hades and imprisoned in the Underworld. Overcome with sorrow and anger. Demeter expressed her displeasure by afflicting the earth with sterility, so that the grain that sustains all human and animal life could not grow, and the world faced starvation and death. The ritual she later taught the people of Eleusis to observe in her honor mirrored the course of her suffering: in addition to holding a torch-lit procession and consuming a special barley drink, public actions that recapitulated Demeter’s nocturnal quest and the beverage she had created to refresh herself, devo- tees participated in secret rites they were forbidden to divulge. Persons who took part in Demeter’s Great Mysteries, ceremonies of initiation into the goddess’s protection and patronage, relived the goddess’s movement from despair to joy when, by Zeus’s"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"40 The Nature and Function of Myth order, her daughter was restored to her. (Demeter s myth and the Eleusinian Myster- ies are discussed in detail in Chapter 4.) A similar instance illustrating ritual’s connection with myth occurs in a tale about the women of Lemnos, a volcanic island in the north Aegean. It was said that Aph- rodite afflicted Lemno’s women with an offensive smell, so that their husbands re- jected them. In retaliation, the wives murdered their husbands, leaving only women on the island. The situation changed unexpectedly when Jason, with his crew of heroes, the Argonauts, suddenly arrived on Lemnos to end the widows’ celibacy. Wel- coming the Argonauts as lovers, the women soon bore children who repopulated the island amid general rejoicing. The Lemnians’ annual ritual mirrored the myth almost precisely: each year all fires were extinguished for nine days and family life ceased, with women eating garlic and separating themselves from the men, who apparently kept out of sight. After nine days, new fire was brought from Apollo’s sacred island of Delos, and the hearth fires were rekindled; the inhabitants then held a festival expressing jubilation at the sexual reunion of husband and wife. In both the Demeter-Persephone myth and that of the women of Lemnos, the action progresses from scenes of loss and deprivation to a climactic restoration (al- though Persephone’s return is only partial; see the Homeric Hymn to Demeter in Chapter 4). Both myth and ritual reflect a consciousness of danger, the ever-present threat to civilized life posed by a possible loss of the food supply or of what fire represents, the ability to transform raw meat into cooked food and to create tools and weapons—the source of a uniquely human culture. The transition from grief to joy in both the Eleusinian and the Lemnian rites offers reassurance that potential disas- ters, including the sundering of basic family ties—the bonds linking mother and child or husband and wife—can be averted and communal life sustained. The Charter Theory The charter theory developed from direct observations of a preliterate people in the active process of making myth serve practical or social purposes. Stranded on the Trobriand Islands near New Guinea during the Lirst World War, the Polish anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski (1884-1942) noted that the Trobrianders used myth to validate existing communal institutions, beliefs, and practices. These “charter” myths are narratives that supply the rationale for some ritual or custom; they serve to justify the practice of a particular initiation rite or other ceremony and to promote its regular repetition, ptesumably to help maintain stability and communal order. A few Greek myths seem to function as charters, justifying some debatable social or religious observance. In his poem of origins, the Theogony, Hesiod provides a foundation story to support the Greeks’ habit of offerin g their^ ods only the least desirable parts of sacrificial animals. Like the biblical Hebrews and other ancient peoples, the Greeks shared aWdmmunal meal with their divine protectors, eating cooked meat and burning the residue, which wafted its way to heaven as a column of smoke. According to Hesiod, when the newly empowered Olympian gods met with primitive men (women had not yet been created) at Mekone “to settle accounts,” the cunning Titan Prometheus slew a sacrificial ox, dividing its carcass into two unequal portions. Goncealing the meat and hide beneath the ox’s unappetizing stomach, he tricked Zeus, king of the gods, into accepting as the gods’ share a pile of inedible bones covered with fat. Hesiod’s story operates as a charter, a validation of the ancient practice of offering the gods only the least desirable parts of a sacrificial animal, the"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Ways of Interpreting Myth 41 bones and fat, while human participants ate the tastier portions. Although Hesiod’s Zeus severely punishes the human race on whose behalf Prometheus has acted, this subversive myth confirms, in typically Greek fashion, humanity’s right to enjoy even that which the gods might wish to claim. While explaining the “how” or “what” of ritual sacrifice, applying the charter theory to this myth fails to account for the im- portant “why”—the distinctive favoring of human welfare over divine prerogative. Myth and Etiology The etiological method sees myths as attempts to explain the cause or origin of things. From the Greek word for “cause” {aitiori), etiology encom- passes two schools of thought. The first regards myth as primitive science, the prod- uct of naive minds trying to give plausible causes of the present structure and opera- tion of the natural world. Hesiod, for example, devotes part of his Theogony to narrating the origins of earth, sky, air, day, night, ocean, mountains, and other aspects of physical nature. A more comprehensive etiological approach emphasizes the broadly explanatory purpose of myth. More than being mere prescientific attempts to account for the natural or social environment, myths can also give theological or metaphysical inter- pretations of the human condition. Hesiod’s Theogony and Works and Days explain why humanity’s possession of fire, which Zeus had wished to retain as an exclusively divine prerogative, led to a tragic alienation between men and gods. Hesiod links the forbidden fire motif to the creation of the first woman. Pandora, whom the gods mold from clay as a “lovely evil” to plague mankind. As Hesiod’s poetry demon- strates, etiological myths can be richly diverse, ranging from narratives of cosmic evolution and divine-human conflict to the human male’s highly ambivalent attitude toward women. Although numerous myths serve an etiological purpose, many heroic tales ordi- narily classified as myth have little to do with etiology. Most of Heracles’ labors, Jason’s quest for the Golden Fleece, Medea’s vengeance on her faithless husband, Oedipus’s tragic fall, and Theseus’s slaying of the Minotaur are not concerned with explaining world origins or social institutions. Internalist Theories: Myth as a Product of the Mind Whereas the nature, ritual, charter, and etiological theorists view myths as essentially interpretations of the external world, a second major school of thought sees them as spontaneous expressions of the human mind. A study of the human psyche (the Greek word meaning “soul,” or “center of consciousness”), psychology proposes an inti- mate link between myth and several mental processes. Freudian Theory and Myth Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) emphasized the impor- tance of the unconscious in determining human behavior and beliefs. He also for- mulated psychoanalysis, a method of therapeutic analysis based on the theory that abnormal mental states result from the repression of emotions that the conscious mind rejects but that persist in the unconscious. In such works as The Interpretation of Dreams, Freud argued that dreams, which typically resemble myths in their im- agery and narrative form, offer important clues to the human psyche. Dreams typi- cally combine elements from everyday life—familiar objects, routines, and per- sons—with fantastic actions in which the dreamer can fly like Icarus (see Color Plates"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"42 The Nature and Funetion of Myth 12 and 13), descend into Hades’ realm like Orpheus (see Figure 9-8), or battle drag- ons like Apollo or Perseus (see Chapters 7 and 10). Whether soaring above moun- taintops or struggling with grotesque monsters, dreamers and mythic heroes inhabit a strangely fluid environment in which ordinary life expands to encompass extraor- dinary characters and actions that transcend the limits of nature. Although Freud at first viewed dreams as basically wish fulfillment, in later studies such as Beyond the Pleasure Principle, he recognized that they could also express the dreamer’s most pro- found anxieties. In analyzing almost innumerable dreams, Freud discovered a common discrep- ancy between the dream’s literal or manifest content and its latent meaning. Accord- ing to Freudian theory, dreamers typically disguise antisocial or forbidden longings as seemingly harmless images; for example, a son may transfer feedings of extreme hostility toward his father to some apparently unrelated symbol, such as an attacking predator. In this process of transference, when the dreamer slays the wild beast, he releases hostile impulses toward what he perceives as a threatening figure—without having to make a painful acknowledgment of his socially unacceptable feelings to- ward his parent. Like dreams, myths permit one to violate taboos with impunity: parental or other authority figures commonly appear as one secretly feels them to be. Thus, antagonism toward the mother transforms her into the man-devouring Sphinx or the snake- haired Gorgon Medusa, whose gaze emasculates men and turns them into crumbling stone. Oedipus can defeat the Sphinx (an image of the treacherous mother) by an- swering her riddle and then go on to commit incest with (and so destroy) the mother who had once abandoned him to be devoured by wild animals (see Chapter 16). By beheading Medusa, Perseus can kill what he hates in maternal power, psychologically freeing himself to rescue Andromeda, the future mother of his children. Freud’s most celebrated application of his psychoanalytical theories to myth relates to the story of Oedipus, a king of Thebes who unwittingly kills his father and marries his mother. According to Freud’s theory of infantile sexuality, the male child passion- ately desires exclusive possession of his mother, whom he regards as the source of all nurturing pleasure. To claim the mother entirely, he must eliminate his male parent, whom he instinctively recognizes as his chief rival for his mother’s affection. On growing older and discovering that both his incestuous feelings toward his mother and his hostility toward his father are prohibited, the boy experiences sexual guilt, which commonly takes the form of a fear of castration, a punishment for the loss of male power that he had wished to inflict on his father. In Sophocles’ Oedipus the King, the hero literally acts out the Oedipal drive, and his doom graphically illustrates the high price society exacts for this transgression. Oedipus’s wife, Jocasta (when not yet aware that she is also his mother), explicitly connects a son’s incestuous desire with dream fulfillment but dismisses the anxiety it produces. By contrast, when he learns the truth about his identity, Oedipus accepts responsibility for his acts: he figuratively castrates himself by gouging out his eyes, the organs of desire, and, through his self-inflicted mutilation, reaffirms the sanctity of the social norm. In sacrificing himself, Oedipus restores communal order, thereby redeeming the city of Thebes (see Chapter 16). Because Greek plays typically dramatize conflicts between members of a single family, Freudian insights into the domestic psychodrama may offer helpful starting points in understanding many tragic myths. Some of Freud’s disciples have noted"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Ways of In terp reti ng Myth 43 that the myth of Electra, heroine of three separate Greek tragedies, is psychologically analogous to that of Oedipus. Idolizing the memory of her dead father, Agamemnon, Electra jealously plots to murder her mother, Clytemnestra (see Chapter 15). In The Glory of Hera, Philip Slater applies some Freudian principles to illustrate the connection between Greek family life and the harrowing battles between family members in Greek myth. Slater points out that Greek boys were raised in an exclu- sively female environment during their early years and then abruptly transferred to an all-male society of school, gymnasium, and military camp, where they were incul- cated with the attitudes of a patriarchal worldview. It seems credible that Greek moth- ers must have entertained decidedly mixed feelings about their sons, taking pride in their achievements yet simultaneously resenting their free enjoyment of opportunities denied to women. That youths who had first been acculturated by their mothers subsequently acquired a socially approved masculine contempt for all things feminine must have created considerable bitterness for Greek women. Although the concept is highly controversial, some feminist critics propose that the anxiety about female hostility contained in some Greek myths has its roots in the distant past (see Chapter 4). As early as Homer’s Odyssey, Agamemnon rails at his wife’s treachery, a theme extensively developed in Aeschylus’s Oresteia (see Chap- ter 15). Outstanding even in myth’s portrait gallery of cruel and dangerous mothers, the Aeschylean Clytemnestra is not only a conniving adulteress but an unnatural mother, abusing her helpless daughter and eager to kill her son Orestes. Aeschylus also identifies this monster-mother with the Furies, creatures addicted to torture and castration of the male. In Euripides’ play the Hippolytus, Phaedra develops an inces- tuous passion for her stepson and, when rejected, successfully contrives to destroy him. Two of Euripides’ mothers. Agave in the Bacchae and the title heroine in the Medea, actually murder their sons, the former ripping her son’s body to pieces (see Chapters 13 and 17). Jungs Archetypal Myths Although Freudian analysis yields important clues to the excessive behavior of a few mythic characters, some modern critics find the work of one of Freud’s leading proteges (and later rival), the Swiss analytical psychologist Carl Jung (1875 — 1961), even more instructive. After studying thousands of myths from cultures all over the globe, Jung was struck by their similarity to dreams in which the same major figures kept reappearing. It did not matter whether the myth—or dreamer—was Italian, Japanese, vAfrican, American, or Indonesian; figures of the great mother, stern paternal judge, threatening stranger, clever trickster, or benign guide were consistently present. One would expect that basic human emotions such as fear, desire, and greed would dominate both dreams and myths, but Jung also found that particular situations and actions—journeys, encounters with frighten- ing monsters, struggles with unidentified assailants—were universal. Jung identified these recurring mythic characters, situations, and events as archetypes. An archetype is the primal form or original pattern of which all other things of the same kind are representatives or copies. In Western cultures, for example, paint- ings of Mary holding the infant Jesus convey an archetypal image of the mother figure, providing an ideal model of maternal tenderness. The Christian Madonna and child, in turn, are a relatively recent manifestation of ancient images found through- out the world, from Egyptian art that depicts Isis nursing a newborn Horus to Greek murals that show a tearful Demeter searching for her lost daughter, Persephone. A"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"44 The Nature and Function of Myth fundamental aspect of human existence, the imprint of a maternal image undoubt- edly characterized the human psyche from its prehistoric beginnings. The Greek gods and/or heroes commonly represent archetypal characteristics or personalities, serving as paradigms for a whole class or category of human types; Zeus, the powerful father whose least frown may evoke terror; Prometheus, the heroic rebel who defies unjust authority; Hera, the strong wife who upholds the institution of matrimony that effects her own subordination; Artemis, the female free spirit who roams wild, disdaining social restraints; Hermes, the epitome of swift mobility who delights in deceiving lesser intellects; Athene, the master planner and strate- gist who outwits the opposition; and Aphrodite, patron of love and desire who revels in the passions she arouses (see Chapters 5 and 6). Because the same basic facts shape all human consciousness, major life events are also archetypal, including birth, sexual maturation, struggles with parents or other authority figures, fraternal rivalry, mating, competition for power, and the onset of sickness and death. Myth, therefore, typically involves archetypal actions suggesting transitions from one stage of being to another; the gods’ struggle to overthrow pa- rental control and assert their individual egos on a cosmic scale (see Chapter 3); the hero’s battle against evil monsters or an arduous journey of discovery into strange and dangerous territory, commonly including a journey to the Underworld (see Chapters 10-12). The myth of Icarus combines a form of Freudian wish fulfillment with an archetypal situation in which the human desire to experience near-absolute free- dom overpowers even the instinct toward self-preservation (Figure 2-2). Icarus [IK- uh-ruhs] is the son of an Athenian craftsman, Daedalus [DEE-duh-luhs], prototype of the artist and inventor, who designs the labyrinth, the vast maze beneath the Knos- sos palace in which King Minos houses the flesh-eating Minotaur. When Minos re- fuses to permit the invaluable Daedalus to leave Crete, Daedalus makes wings of feathers and wax so that he and Icarus can escape from Minoan captivity. Aware of the perils of humans unnaturally behaving like birds, Daedalus warns his son not to fly too low lest his wings become waterlogged or too high lest the sun’s heat melt the wax holding his wings together. Suddenly given dizzying freedom from earthly con- straints, Icarus soars heavenward, trespassing the boundary between mortal and im- mortal spheres. Approaching too near the sun, Icarus finds that his artificial wings disintegrate, plunging him to his death in the Aegean Sea, a part of which was later named the Icarian Sea after him. When granted the opportunity to break barriers that ordinarily separate humanity from the gods, Icarus, an image of human nature, cannot resist exploring the unknown and forbidden. His adventurous impulse, and its fatal consequences, are as inevitable as Pandora’s opening the jar of woes (see Chapter 6; see also Color Plates 12 and 13). Archetypal figures, events, and situations seem to pervade the minds of every eth- nic group, whether belonging to a literate technological society or to a preliterate hunting-and-gathering community (Figure 2-3). For Jung, these archetypes spring from the collective unconscious, a term he used to denote the mental images, cogni- tive patterns, symbols, innate memories, and intrinsic assumptions that all members of a given culture—or the entire human race—hold in common. According to Jungian theory, the collective unconscious spawns virtually all creative activity, in- cluding dreams, religious visions, and mythologies.

In this bas-relief, Daedalus, prototype of the artist-inventor, makes wings of feathers and wax for his son Icarus. Ignoring his father’s warning not to fly too high, Icarus rashly approaches too near to the sun, causing the wax hold- ing his wings together to melt and precipitating his lethal fall into the sea. A cautionary tale about hu- mans foolishly trespassing into the gods’ realm, the Icarus myth is also an example of human wish fulfillment in which an ad- venturesome youth soars through the heavens like Zeus’s eagle—and of the inevitable consequences when religious or societal laws are broken. (Villa Albani, Rome) we can still relate intimately to myths of birth, testing, conflict, death, and rebirth that originated thousands of years ago because our unconscious minds have inherited these mythic archetypes from our remotest ancestors. Jung further postulated that the human unconscious also houses archetypal images of both the male and female principles. The anima> an internal expression of arche- typal feminine wisdom and creativity, inhabits the minds of men as well as women. Correspondingly, the animus, which embodies essential masculine qualities, is pres- ent in both male and female psyches. Because the anima and animus are also partly determined by feelings derived from an individual’s direct experience of other men or women, these indwelling images can include negative perceptions of masculinity or femininity. A distorted anima can produce an internalized view of woman as dan- gerous or destructive (a Medusa or Fury). Similarly, a woman may perceive the male primarily as a potential rapist or tyrant, the way Zeus's brother Fiades appears to Persephone when he abducts the young woman and imprisons her in the Underworld (see Chapter 4). In the healthy psyche, however, anima and animus achieve a har- monious relationship with each other, as they do in the reunion of Odysseus and his wife, Penelope (see Chapter 12)."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"46 The Nature and Function of Myth FIGURE 2-3 A Female Archetype: Aphrodite.

The tradi- tion in which she is the daughter of Zeus and Dione (a Titan goddess), however, serves to place Aphrodite’s rampant sexuality within the frame- work of cosmic order: as Zeus’s child, natural lust must be subject to reli- gious and social restraints. (National Museum ofTerme, Rome) In addition, the mind contains a sinister force that Jung called the shadow, a composite of unacknowledged negative elements—unconscious fear, hatred, envy, unsatisfied desire—within the human personality. As we shall discover, numerous myths about the Greco-Roman gods and heroes present a Jungian tension between a character’s conscious intentions and an unacknowledged shadow self—repressed or undervalued aspects of the personality—that commonly functions counterproduc- tively or self-destructively. Despite his victory over the Titans, Zeus is internally sub- verted by lust and a tyrannical egocentrism, as is FFeracles by deadly outbursts of uncontrolled rage. Both god and hero ultimately triumph, but only after overcoming or assimilating some morally ambiguous aspect of their own natures. Many contemporary interpreters of myth have been influenced by Freud or Jung, including Joseph Campbell, who has written numerous books applying Jungian in- sights to world myths. In such works as The Masks of God and The Hero with a Thousand Faces, Campbell explores the archetypal hero’s adventures, particularly his tests of courage, honor, and self-knowledge. The hero’s rite of passage typically fea- tures a cyclical process involving a necessary separation from his original environ- ment: a journey in which he encounters frightening, even supernatural, forces; an"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Ways of In terp reti ng Myth 47 initiation into hitherto unknown regions, roles, or relationships; and an eventual return to his point of departure. These rites of passage represent the hero’s stages of psychological development and maturation: by meeting challenges and surmounting obstacles, such heroes as Odysseus, Perseus, and Heracles fulfill their innate potential and grow into true selfhood, a process Jung called individuation. Other important writers giving psychological analyses of myth include Ernst Cas- sirer, Mircea Eliade, and Victor Turner. Cassirer argues that myth is no less than the mind’s spontaneous creation of an emotionally satisfying cosmos that it imposes on the external world. Myths satisfy because, like religion, they project symbolic mean- ing on the natural and human environment, imparting a significance otherwise ab- sent in objective reality. In Myth and Reality and The Sacred and the Profane, Eliade, a philosopher and historian of religion, presents world myths as sacred tales emanat- ing from a singularly creative era of prehistory. While Eliade emphasizes myth’s relationship to a vanished epoch of unique holi- ness, Turner argues that myths serve a combined psychological and social purpose in the present, promoting liminal, or threshold, experiences. Whereas the charter ap- proach sees myths associated with rituals operating primarily to justify or validate the ritual itself. Turner sees myth and ritual linked by their psychological function, help- ing to ease people through life’s difficult transitions. Thus, stories involving certain rituals help individuals cope with various crises or changes in social position, includ- ing rites of passage for boys initiated into warrior status, for girls into marriageable womanhood, and for adults into roles of community leadership. Structuralism and Myth Most psychological theorists regard myths as a natural expression of the psyche—one that functions therapeutically to purge unacceptable desire, provide creative energy, reconcile individuals to their environment, and attrib- ute moral order and meaning to the universe. Structuralism further refines this con- cept, viewing myth as a reflection of the mind’s binary organization. Structuralists, such as the Belgian anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss (1908-), observe that hu- man beings tend to see the world as a reflection of their own physical and cerebral structure. Equipped with two eyes, legs, arms, and hands and—most important— a brain divided into two hemispheres, we automatically project a binary significance onto experience, typically dividing everything into polar opposit es: right/left, light/ dark, pleasure/pain, beautiful/ugly, good/evil, cooked/raw, civilized/savage. In Levi- Strauss’s view, myth deals with the perception and reconciliation of these opposites, which m^ay be rendered as conflicts between natural order and human lawlessness, instinctual desire and social prohibition, or the divine will and human ambition. The many tensions inherent in the human predicament, such as the dichotomy between individual need and communal obligation, are the inspiration of myth, which is cre- ated to resolve or mitigate these contradictory forces. Jean-Pierre Vernant and Pierre Vidal-Naquet, contemporary French classical scholars who employ a modified structuralism in their studies of Greek myth, have produced some intriguing reinterpretations. In Myth and Tragedy in Ancient Greece, Vernant and Vidal-Naquet emphasize the contradictions and confusions of reality that characterize the Greek tragic drama. Vernant’s Myth and Society in Ancient Greece focuses on the alien quality of Greek culture, with its primeval traditions of ceremonial hunting, blood sacrifice, slavery, ritualized warfare, and religious ecstasy. Avoiding a literalist application of Levi-Strauss’s binary mode, Vernant provides an"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"48 The Nature and Function of Myth insightful critique of structuralism that emphasizes the ambiguity, complexity, and mercurial nature of myth. Helpful as it can be in highlighting the oppositions and conflicts inherent in many myths, some scholars question structuralism’s overly neat binary approach, pointing out that not all myths present a quantitative division of opposites or even a formal linear development. In the story of Odysseus and Penelope, for instance, the two partners evince a complementary rather than conflicted relationship. Narratology Some aspects of structuralism were anticipated in the work of the Rus- sian folklorist Vladimir Propp. In his seminal Morphology of the Folktale (1928), Propp identified seven “spheres of action” and thirty-one “functions” that he believed were intrinsic to traditional tales. In analyzing a narrative’s sequence of events, Propp emphasized that the action follows a distinctive pattern, giving traditional stories a recognizably similar structure. Narratology, the study of narrative structure, assumes that virtually all tales exhibit a common language in the form of universal patterns that control the order of events. In many Greek myths, for example, the hero’s adven- tures conform to a predictable order: born from the union of a divine being with a mortal, the hero typically combines godlike ambition with human vulnerability; he leaves home on a quest in which he confronts and defeats supernatural adversaries, passes difficult or perilous tests of courage and intelligence, and narrowly escapes death. His tasks may involve retrieving treasure from a guardian dragon and/or res- cuing an endangered princess; his rewards commonly include winning the princess in marriage, gaining riches, and/or receiving a crown. Thus, Odysseus sails from Ithaca to Troy where he proves his mettle as a warrior; embarks on a long voyage home beset by ogres and lethal temptresses, all of which obstacles he overcomes; battles rivals successfully to demonstrate his right to claim the princess (in this case his wife, Penelope); and reclaims his property and kingship. Rarely is this sequence reversed: ordinarily the hero does not first win a bride, find a treasure, and mount a throne, and only afterward wrestle a hydra, kill a Medusa, or descend to the Underworld. Although the mythic narrative commonly observes the sequence of quest, chal- lenge, struggle, victory, and reward, the order is far from universal. The tragic hero in particular may face his greatest threats and obstacles after he has already attained wife, kingship, and fame. By cleverly and courageously solving the riddle of the Sphinx, Oedipus acquires a royal wife, crown, and reputation, only to lose it all in a fatal quest for his true identity (see Chapter 16). The “last acts” in the careers of such heroes as Agamemnon, Jason, and Heracles manifest this postreward reversal, which characteristically involves making a fatally flawed decision concerning their marital relationships. Because myth takes the form of narrative—the sequential arrangement of action and its consequences over time—it expresses a linear and irrevocable movement in its characters’ lives, a progression in which time’s arrow flies in only one direction— toward death. As the ultimate shaping influence on the contours of even the greatest heroic endeavor, Greek myth’s unrelenting emphasis on human mortality—the chief factor that distinguishes heroes from gods—gives most heroic tales a final vertical twist. The graph of a hero’s life typically features a linear upward progression as he climbs fame’s pinnacle by performing immortal deeds, but it takes an abrupt down-"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Ways of Interpreting Myth 49 ward turn at his career’s end. In contrast to much folklore, Greek myth never con- cludes with a pronouncement that the tale’s principal couple “lived happily ever af- ter.” Eschewing such optimism, Greek mythology routinely insists on narrating the manner and circumstances of the hero’s death. Besides describing in detail the slaugh- ter of military leaders who perish at Troy or in other wars, the narratives, with extraor- dinary consistency, encompass the demise of those who survive conflicts as well. From Heracles to Jason and Agamemnon to Odysseus (in post-Homeric lore), vir- tually no hero exits his myth still alive; in most stories, the vertical descent to Hades’ realm is made explicit. As if to assure us of this universal morbidity, many tales in- clude a visit to the Underworld, where the shades of dead heroes are interviewed, providing unimpeachable evidence that all personal narratives end at a state in which no further action is possible. (In rare cases, a mortal son of Zeus, such as Heracles, undergoes posthumous deification and joins the gods in heaven, thus transcending the linear confines of his story by entering a supranatural dimension; see Chapter 10.) Feminist Approaches to Myth Rather than constituting a “school” of mythography or sharing a single approach to interpreting myth, feminist scholars have collectively focused on reemphasizing com- ponents of myth previously neglected or recovering knowledge of some aspects of mythmaking cultures previously unavailable. Feminist scholars have contributed es- pecially to our understanding of the goddess figures and the rituals related to their worship, as well as their relationship to the male gods. Scholars such as Marija Gimbutas, who assembled and interpreted vast numbers of artifacts, have revealed the extent of goddess worship throughout Europe before the advent of sky gods in the region. More recently, archaeologists have discovered goddess shrines carved into the mountainsides of Crete, thus overturning previous assumptions that the inhabitants of ancient Crete (whose society was one of the major sources of Greek culture) were a relatively “secular” people. Similar shrines elsewhere, such as at Catal Huyuk in Anatolia (western Turkey), and ancient aboriginal shrines in Australia, were found to share the same goddess symbols described by Gimbutas, including circles or lozenges with a dot in the center, painted on the walls in red ochre. Explaining the recurrent themes of these and other sites, mythographer Elinor Gadon and others make clear what our knowledge of the widespread worship of creator goddesses contributes to our understanding of the roles of Greek goddesses such as Gaea and Demeter (see Chapter 4). Other feminist scholars have explored the psychological insights manifested in the goddess myths. Carol Gilligan, for example, uses contemporary psychological ap- proaches to elucidate the stages of a woman’s life as depicted in the story of Demeter and Persephone (see Chapter 4) and then applies that myth to the lives of modern women. Lenses of Mythology The large number of competing scholarly theories about the nature of myth suggests its diversity, elusiveness, and continuing power to elicit a broad range of human re- sponses. Disparate theories abound because different scholars, influenced by their"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"50 The Nature and Function of Myth Myth Theory dnd the Birth o [ Ath ene A single myth, such as the birth of Athene, yields a variety of meanings when different theories of myth are applied to the story. Athene’s leaping forth, fully armed, from Zeus s head may violate our sense of reality, but it makes good sense from both externalist and internalist perspectives. Viewed as a nature myth, Athene’s origin largely reflects the recognition that human thought takes place in the brain. In asserting that Zeus produced Athene from his own being, the tradition issues a powerjful statement about the intrinsic value of wisdom and its close rela- tionship to divinity. In its etiological function, the myth describes a shift from feminine notions of divinity to patriarchal concerns: thought and cunning, for- merly independent in an autonomous female, Metis, are now embodied in Zeus’s daughter, subordinated to male rule. Athene’s perpetual virginity means that her father will always be the decisive force in her life and that his influence will never be challenged by an overly ambitious son-in-law. Operating as a charter, the myth validates both patriarchy and the institution of marriage in which the husband has total control of his wife, even to the point of taking over her identity. Phidias’s use of Athene’s birth in the Parthenon sculptures also functions as a specifle political charter, visually proclaiming Athens’s unique connection with the highest gods (see Figure 1-2). As Athene is Zeus’s first and favorite offspimg, so the city she protects enjoys a special relationship with the king of heaven. The dreamlike image of pure thought issuing from the mind of god and taking visible shape as Athens’s super- natural patron explicitly validates Athenian social institutions. In terms of Jungian psychology, Athene’s birth from a male represents the ar- chetypal union of the animus and the anima. As an example of psychoanalysis, it expresses the male fear of the castrating female: Zeus swallows Metis to prevent her from dominating him or producing a rival who will usurp his masculine power. In a Freudian sense, Zeus reenacts an Oedipal fear of competition with the father, imitating Cronus’s method of preventing future rivalry by imprisoning all potential threats within his own body and then transforming feminine intelligence into a daughter under his control (see Chapter 3). inescapable cultural assumptions, commonly view myth through but one of the many different lenses by which the mythic eye perceives reality. As Wendy Danziger points out in her study of myth, theology, and politics. The Implied Spider, myth provides at least two lenses through which we see our universe: the microscope, which focuses on the details, the individual experience, the specific social, cultural, or political world with which myth engages; and the telescope, which offers a panorama of the big picture, the universal images or experiences, the cosmic sweep—as well as innumer- able intermediate angles of vision. By offering a connection between these ocular possibilities, myth allows us to see the small world of individual experience through the lens of larger, universal reality and to experience the otherwise unimaginable cosmic vision through the concrete"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Ways of In terp reti ng Myth 51 Zeus s assimilation of Metis also illustrates the gods progression from a merely successful warrior, a fighter who defeated the Titans, to a mature ruler who under- stands the value of taking pragmatic Metis as his internal voice and wise-counseling Athene as his trusted confidante. By this act, a symbolic rite of passage, Zeus moves to a higher stage of development, a liminal experience that marks his strategic ad- vance beyond the mere brute force that characterized his Titan predecessors. Fi- nally, viewed from a binary or structuralist position, the myth expresses the benefit to humanity of reconciling its natural, instinctual, physical component (the young, undeveloped Zeus, who wins his throne largely through the destructiveness of his thunderbolts) with its higher potential centered in the rational intellect (Metis). The creative union of the body-mind dichotomy produces Athene, in whose person both strength (the military skill to defend civilized values) and intelligence (the ability to rule wisely) are harmonized. Whereas some myths, such as the tale of Athene’s birth, lend themselves to a broad spectrum of theoretical analyses, others seem to invite a distinctive mode of interpretation. Aeschylus’s presentation of Orestes’ dilemma dramatizes a conflict and final resolution of opposites, suggesting a structuralist approach—while still allowing for other approaches, such as a Freudian analysis of Orestes’ tangled family relationships. In the Orestes plays, Aeschylus’s characters seem to act out a dialectic between the id (amoral instinct), the ego (individual will), and the superego (divine law) (see Chapter 15, “Conflict and Opposition in the Myth of the Flouse of Ath- ens”). By contrast, the Odysseys hero appears to undergo a process of individuation in which he learns and matures through contact with and the assimilation of arche- typal principles of feminine wisdom, inviting a Jungian interpretation. At the same time, Homer’s narrative may represent the hero’s adventures as a complex series of initiations or rites of passage (see Chapter 12). Several elements in Hesiod’s creation story, such as the origin of earth’s topographical features, have an etiological com- ponent, explaining the process by which the world evolved into its present shape and configuration. details of a particular narrative. To use Danziger’s analogy, the advantage of employ- ing an inclusive approach in viewing myth is that it permits us to examine myths from both microscopic and telescopic perspectives at once, or to set the aperture of our lens at any point between. The Autonomy o’ Myth Although scholars continue to develop and refine theories that will provide the elusive key to understanding mythology, Greek myth has a vitality and inner logic that con- founds attempts to make it conform to any given theory. Some modern efforts to"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"52 The Nature and Function of Myth reduce its diversities to fit a single monolithic interpretation recall the tale of Pro- crustes, a notorious thief and extortionist who kidnaped travelers and tied them to an iron bed. If a victim was too tall and his legs extended over the foot of the bed, they were chopped off. If the victim was too short, he was forcibly stretched out to fit the iron frame. To avoid any such Procrustean excess, this book tries not to force every myth discussed into one theoretical mold. The authors believe that several dif- ferent methods provide valid approaches to particular myths, including some etio- logical, ritual, Freudian, Jungian, and structuralist techniques. In some cases, the myths are presented theory-free, with an emphasis on the historical circumstances of their development. In most cases, discussion focuses on the content of the myth, a product of the human imagination. Questions for Discussion and Review 1. How did Archaic and Classical Greeks interpret their myths? How does Euhemerism differ from the allegorical method? What was the ancient Greek belief about myth’s relation to history? In what ways could a city-state, such as Athens, employ myth to bolster its prestige or political authority? 2. Some nineteenth-century scholars regarded mythmaking as a quasi-scientific attempt to interpret the natural world and/or the human social environment. Describe the nature, ritual, charter, and etiological theories about the origin or purpose of myth. 3. Some scholars believe that mythmaking is an innate—and spontaneous—function of the human mind. Explain some psychologically based theories of myth, particularly the claims that Freud and Jung make about the operations of the human psyche. Define the terms collective unconscious, anima, animus, archetype, shadow, and individuation. 4. If human beings tend automatically to perceive the world in terms of tensions between opposites, how can myth function to mediate these assumed contrarieties? Describe the structuralist position.

Chaos and Gaea (the earth) are the sources of all that exists, including seas, mountains, mon- sters, and gods. Celebrating the rise of Zeus to cosmic rulership, Hesiod's Theogony traces the gods' descent from Gaea and her son, Uranus (the sky), who mate to produce the Titans, a race of giant deities led by Cronus. On Gaea's advice, Cronus emasctdates his father, Uranus, separating sky from earth, and seizes control of the cosmos. Cronus, in turn, is overthrown by his youngest son, Zeus, who defeats the Titans in battle, imprisons them in Tartarus, and establishes his Olympian sovereignty. vJome Greek scientists such as Aristarchus of Samos (c. 320 B.C.) correctly postulated that the earth is a globe, suspended in space, that orbits around the sun. Long before classical astronomers produced theo- ries based on mathematical calculations, however, Greek poets such as Hesiod (c. 700 B.c.) promoted a mythic conception of the universe, based partly on ancient Near Eastern models and partly on commonsensical observations of their physical environment. The world structure reflected in Hesiod’s Theogony, the Greeks’ oldest and most influential account of how all things began, is that which a careful observer might infer after taking a look around.

The Parthenon sculptures thus picture the gods inhabiting an invisible region above the solar and lunar orbits, reflecting their superior power and status.

The sun, rising in the East, appears to trace an arc across the sky before sinking into darkness in the West, typically to be followed by the moon’s ascent. In addition, one may assume that Olympus, dwelling place of the gods, lies somewhere above heaven’s vault. This picture, in fact, is precisely the structure used to frame the scene of Athene’s birth on the Parthenon’s east pediment. In the extreme lower-left corner, horses pulling Helios’s chariot rear their heads, heralding the sunrise (Figure 3-1); in the right-hand corner, Selene pilots the moon’s descending car (Figure 3-2). The family of gods gathered on Olympus presumably stands above the solar and lunar orbits. Greek myth thus postulates a vertically structured three-story universe (Figure 3-3). The top level, infinitely beyond human reach, is an invisible heaven inha- bited exclusively by gods who live untouched by human woes. The Olympian gods’ carefree existence contrasts sharply with the harshness of life in the middle story—earth—where Fate assigns mortals an unequal mixture of joy and pain that inevitably ends in death. Conceived as a relatively flat disk, except where high mountains like Olympus seem to support the sky, the earth’s circular surface is surrounded by Ocean. Rather than an open sea like the Atlantic, Ocean is an immeasurable river coiled around the central landmass.

Hades’ realm permanently houses all the dead, who, according to Homer, exist only as disembodied shades flitting aimlessly in eternal darkness.

(Acropolis Museum, Athens) Hesiod s Theogony and Ancient Near Eastern Myth The evolution of a three-tier cosmos—heaven, earth, and Underworld—envisoned in Hesiod’s Theogony encompasses both a cosmogony {cosmos + gonos [“offspring”]), an account of the universe’s physical origin and organization, and a cosmology, a metaphysical statement about the universe’s nature and purpose. As its title implies, the Theogony (Birth of the Gods) is primarily a religious work, a vision of the gods’ origins, progeny, and genealogy. In fashioning his account of divine origins, Hesiod draws on traditions derived from cultures much older than Greek civilization, particularly those of the ancient Near East. The closest parallels to Hesiod’s poem are found in the creation stories of Mesopotamia, where a people known as the Sumerians developed the first large urban centers almost three millennia before Hesiod’s time. Known to the Greeks as “the land between the [Tigris and Euphrates] rivers,” Mesopotamia is a flat, swampy region at the head of the Persian Gulf in what is now southern Iraq (Figure 3-4). Shortly after 3500 B.C., the Sumerians founded the earliest cities, such as Ur, the native city of the biblical patriarch Abraham, and Uruk, home to Gilgamesh, the first hero of Western myth (see the box on Gilgamesh in Chapter 10). A re- markably innovative group, the Sumerians produced a series of inventions that ranged from the wheel, to the first law codes, to the art of writing. Some Sumerian literary texts and those of the Akkadians (Old Babylonians), a Semitic people who invaded Mesopotamia about 2000 B.C., contain the oldest surviving narratives about the origin of the gods, the creation of the universe, and a prehistoric flood that al- legedly drowned most of earth’s population.

Besides inheriting the concept of a vertically ordered cosmos, Hesiod also reflects a Mesopotamian belief in a divine pantheon in which most of the gods were associ- ated with either the sky and weather or the Underworld and fertility. In addition, Hesiod follows a tradition in the Enuma Elishy a Babylonian creation account, in which the chief sky god came to power only after battling and defeating older genera- tions of gods. In the Enuma Elish (c. 1300 B.C.), the Babylonian deity Marduk earns his cosmic supremacy after overthrowing Tiamat, a personification of the sterile salt sea who is also the primordial dragon of precreation chaos. After slaying Tiamat, Marduk cuts her body in two, using one half to mold the earth and the other to form the vault of heaven; he then creates humanity from the blood of Tiamat’s vanquished consort, Kingu. Similarly, in Hesiod’s Theogony, Zeus—whom the Greeks identi- fied with Marduk—battles the monster Typhoeus, like Tiamat a reptilian embodi- ment of chaotic violence. Only after eliminating such threats to cosmic order can Marduk or Zeus begin his successful reigns.

Both Marduk and Zeus prove their right to govern the world through their superior strength and martial skill, and both gods are able to retain their hold on power by advancing shrewd policies. After conquering their op- ponents, they wisely assign spheres of influence to other gods, establishing an orderly administration based on cooperation and the judicious delegation of shared authority. Besides parallels to the Enuma Elish, the Theogony contains motifs from other ancient Near Eastern sources, such as the Hurrian-Fiittite Kingship in Heaven and Song of Ullikummi. The account in which the usurping god Kumarbi bites off and swallows Anus genitals anticipates the castration of Uranus, a crucial event in Hesiod’s poem. In both the Greek and Near Eastern versions, as the vanquished god, Anu or Uranus, flees to the distant heavens, his severed genitals produce new divini- ties.

In Mesopotamian cities, the most distinctive sacred structure was the ziggurat [ZIG-oo-rat], a massive, multitiered edifice of glazed brick, crowned by a small chapel at the top, that was believed to house the individual deity, such as Marduk, to whom the building was dedicated. With broad staircases connecting its several levels, the ziggurat was, like the spire of a Christian cathedral, a visible link symbolically uniting humans on earth with invisible powers inhabiting the sky (Figure 3-5). Both biblical and Greek traditions echo aspects of the ziggurat s mythic func- tion. In Genesis’s Tower of Babel story, ambitious humans impiously erect a tower high enough to reach heaven, only to have their misguided project overthrown by God. In the Greek version of this myth, the giants Ephialtes and Otus try to invade the divine realm by piling one huge mountain on top of another—Pelion on Ossa and Ossa on Olympus—until Zeus destroys them. In another Genesis narrative, the patriarch Jacob dreams of a colossal “ladder” or ramp by which supernatural figures ascend to or descend from heaven. Historians believe that Jacob’s dream more accurately pictures the ziggurat’s purpose: rather than being a means for hu- mans to trespass into the gods’ territory, the ziggurat served as an artificial moun- tain on which divine beings could visit earth and human beings could rise partway to meet them. A holy place at which earth and heaven, mortals and gods, could commune with each other, the ziggurat had a role resembling that of the Greek holy mountain of Parnassus, a sanctuary where Apollo reveals the gods’ will to human questioners (see Chapter 7).

The Phoenicians, a seafaring people from whom the Greeks borrowed the alphabet, were perhaps the chief mediators in transmitting the Near East’s cultural legacy to Greece. Intergenerational conflict among the gods is one of Hesiod’s main themes, but he also wishes to show that conflict permeates every level of the cosmos, especially family life and economic competition on earth. Introducing an autobiographical subtheme, Hesiod states that his father, unable to prosper as a sea trader in Ionia, migrated west to Boeotia on the Greek mainland (Figure 3-6), where Hesiod was born to a life of poverty and hard work. Hesiod’s poetry bristles with complaints about the slights and injustices he and other small landholders had to endure.

Although little more than a thousand lines long, one- fifteenth the length of the Iliad, Hesiod’s Theogony is an enormously ambitious effort: an attempt to unfold the history of the universe from its inception to the poet’s own day. Honoring the goddesses’ request, Hesiod begins each major segment of the poem with an invocation of the Muse, asking Mnemosyne’s daughters to inspire him with creative success. Note that it is the Muses in their Olympian guise (line 60) who inspire the poet to sing of the highest gods, transforming his song into a hymn exalting Zeus. The Ori gins o[ the Gods Readers familiar with the biblical story of creation may find Hesiod’s version of how all things began somewhat alien. Unlike the Genesis account, which describes a single God fashioning heaven and earth out of a primordial watery chaos by the power of his word alone, the Theogony presents a polytheistic world spontaneously evolving, moving swiftly from primal emptiness to a universe teeming with life.

Like Hesiod and his counterparts in other ancient societies, biblical editors and compilers also accepted differing versions of prehistoric events as equally venerable and worth preserving. In the opening chapters of Genesis, the first book of the Judeo-Christian Bible, editors combined two previously independent stories about the universes beginnings. Scholars ascribe the first account (Gen. 1:1—2:4) to a priestly author writing in Mesopotamia during the sixth century B.C., when many upper-class Israelites were held captive in Babylon, This priestly narrative, which calls God Elohim, a generic term for “divine being,” opens with a precreation chaos of undifferentiated waters similar to that assumed in the Babylonian creation story, the Enuma Elish. Unlike the Babylonian tale that features violent conflict between different generations of gods, however, the biblical narrative reshapes older myths of a primordial watery chaos to fit a monotheistic concept. In Genesis 1, a single deity—Elohim—transforms chaos into cosmos by his word alone, creating the world by a six-step process of separation, division, and differentiation. In the priestly account, humans—both male and female—are fashioned at the same time and both in “the image of God.” Following the formation of dry land, plants, and animals, humanity’s appearance in the divine image is the climax of creation. In its second tale of origins (Gen. 2:5—25), it is not Elohim but Yahweh (the personal name of the biblical God) who creates, and he does so in an entirely different environment and in a different order. Instead of beginning with a watery chaos as the priestly author does in Genesis 1, the Yah wist writer (so called because he or she consistently identifies God as Yahweh) sets creation in an arid desert that has to be irrigated. Instead of making humanity’s appearance the final event, the Yahwist states that, after Adam (whose name means “humankind”) is formed from dust, the animals are then fashioned and brought to Adam to name. Only when Yahweh discovers that no animal provides a suitable mate for his human creature does the Deity decide to create a woman.

He- siod’s understanding of Chaos contrasts with that in Ovid’s Metamorphoses, where it is defined as anarchic dark matter that preceded the formation of the cosmos (see Chapter 20). For Hesiod, Gaea [JEE-uh] {Gaia), who is both the earth and the primordial mother, is also a primal entity. Gaea springs independently into existence, along with Tartarus [TAHR-tahr-uhs], the subterranean abyss that will later house monsters and fallen gods, and Eros [AIR-ohs], the driving force of procreative love. Although Chaos and Gaea, as well as some male deities, occasionally give birth with- out a mate, Eros’s presence ensures that life will multiply chiefly through sexual repro- duction. Like later Greek scientists and philosophers, Hesiod shows a keen interest in organizing and classifying material, in this poem delineating the genealogies and familial relationships of three generations of gods.

In Hesiod’s view, Eros is the procreative force respon- sible for populating the universe, generating both gods and heroes. About three and a half centuries after Hesiod’s day, the Athenian philosopher Plato (427—347 B.C.) made the nature and purpose of Eros the subject of one of his most important dialogues, the Symposium (Figure 3-9). The fictional re-creation of a drinking party attended by some of Athens’s most famous citizens, including Socrates, Agathon, Alcibiades, and the comic playwright Aristophanes, the Symposium contains numer- ous references to different myths about Eros’s origin and purpose. Aristophanes, a fictive character whom Plato bases on the historical author of erotic comedies, offers an etiological myth to explain both the universality of sexual attraction and the rea- son for its diverse manifestations. In the beginning, Aristophanes states, there were not merely two sexes—male and female—but three, the third being androgynous, composed of both male and female characteristics. The male sex derived from the sun, the female from the earth, and the androgynous from the moon, which the ancients believed to partake of both sun and earth. Originally, human beings were twice the person they are now; round in shape, each had two heads facing in opposite directions and two sets of arms and legs. These double creatures could go either forward or backward FIGURE 3-9 A Greek Symposium.

Strong and confident—their circular form indicating their completeness— these primordial humans were also intensely ambitious. Like the giants Ephialtes and Otus, sons of Poseidon who attempted to invade the heavens, early humans dared to challenge the gods with a direct attack. Zeus, who did not want to oblit- erate them with lightning as he had the giants, decided instead to weaken humanity by splitting each person in two. As soon as Zeus bisected an individual, Apollo turned the creature’s head around to face the side that had been cut, drawing skin over it “like a pouch with drawstrings” and tying the skin together in a knot on the abdomen, thus giving humans a navel. With their ambition punished and their power diminished, humans ceased ri- valing the gods and began to devote their energies to seeking the half of their origi- nal person that had been lost. The androgynes, who had resembled the biblical Adam before the female Eve was separated from his body, sought their other half in members of the opposite sex, forming heterosexual combinations. Those who had been all male naturally endeavored to reunite with members of the same sex, while formerly all-female beings longed to restore their basic nature by coupling with other women. Human sexual attraction, Aristophanes declares, is inspired by a profound need to recapture the wholeness of personality that existed before Zeus bifurcated us (Figure 3-10). The playwright then conjures up the spirit of Hephaestus, the inge- nious god of metalcraft, who offers to fuse together those lovers who desire total union with their beloved, melding the artificially divided two into one. By thus uniting humanity’s fragmented nature, Eros enables lovers to regain the lost para- dise of spiritual and physical completeness."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"72 The Mythic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes FIGURE 3-11 Aphrodite Rising from the Sea. In Hesiods version of her origin, the love goddess has no mother and is born from the sea foam surrounding the severed genitals of Uranus, the primal sky god. She rises from a watery element as if to demonstrate that a con- scious awareness of human sexuality as a divine force is born from the universal unconscious.

The Castration of Uranus and the Birth of Aphrodite Of the scores of births catalogued in the Theogony, two—those of Aphrodite and Athene—most strikingly represent the contradictory themes that Hesiod weaves into his account. Aphrodite [af-roh-DYE-tee], the embodiment of love, beauty, and sexual desire, is the result of a grotesquely violent act—the castration of Uranus by his son Cronus. Gaea, who deeply resents Uranus for his refusal to allow her the relief of giving birth to the many children painfully confined in her subterranean womb, initiates the events leading to her husband’s dethronement and Aphrodite’s miraculous appearance. Following his mother’s instructions and using the adamantine sickle she had fashioned for the purpose, Cronus, the most “crafty” of the Titans, ambushes his parents during copulation and severs his father’s genitals, which he throws into the sea. This act, which permanently separates earth and sky, has a strangely paradoxical effect: drops of phallic blood touching the earth generate both giants and the Furies (Erinyes), dreaded female spirits who punish criminals guilty of slaying their kin. The sea foam that collects around Uranus’s severed phallus is transformed into “golden” Aphrodite, the most beguilingly feminine of all goddesses yet born without a female parent (Figure 3-11 and Color Plate 1). In the Theogony, Aphrodite’s origin clearly testifies to her function as patron of masculine sexual pleasure. Ultimately, however.

Cronus’s action leads the world another step closer to Zeus’s inevitable reign, of which the love goddess will be a radiant ornament (Fig- ure 3-12); however, it is also a savage betrayal of a kinsman that brings the spirits of hatred and revenge into being. Resulting from an act that combines sexual passion and violence, Aphrodite’s birth expresses a characteristic Greek ambivalence about sexual love: although promising beauty and joy, it can also inspire acts of violent aggression. Aphrodite’s appearance prior to the birth of Zeus or any other Olympians also implies the love goddess’s primacy, both in time and in universal significance. Consistent with his treacherous brutality, Cronus attempts to avoid Uranus’s fate by devouring his own children, all of Zeus’s older brothers and sisters (Figure 3-13), thereby imitating his father’s life-denying policy and ensuring that any offspring who might escape his cannibalism — as Zeus does—will repeat his rebellion.

(Prado Museum, Madrid) a division necessary to achieve an inhabitable cosmos. In Egyptian tradition, which reverses the sexes of the two primal entities, the goddess Nut (the sky) is separated from her brother Geb (the earth) because their original embrace was so tight that their divine children had no room in which to be born. Accordingly, their father, Shu, god of the air, parted the incestuous couple, elevating Nut so that she arched her body far above Geb and thereby allowing the gods Isis, Osiris, Nephthys, and Seth to emerge into the atmosphere. Another Egyptian theme appearing in Hesiod s account is that of parent devouring child: it was said that, not only did Nut swallow the sun every night, but in the morning she ate her own offspring, the stars, which, of course, were reborn every evening after sunset. Rather than serving as a model or justification for sons in primitive societies to seize power from their aged fathers, the Uranus-Gronus conflict echoes a convention of ancient cosmogony. The creative process demands that sky be removed from earth in order for life to develop. As in the Egyptian tale, Hesiods account makes it clear that new gods cannot appear until their divine parents are permanently riven. Rep- resenting the dark night sky, studded with brilliant stars, Uranus remains in the dis- tant background to be consulted occasionally, as when Rhea asks for his and Gaea’s help, but heaven’s extreme remoteness means that sky plays little role in subsequent events, an impotence symbolized by Uranus’s emasculation. The tale of a primal deity whose body, like that of Uranus, suffers mutilation and then is used as building material to form part of the physical universe, is common to mythology around the world.

Chinese myth offers a parallel account: a primor- dial deity, Pangu, exhausts himself performing the essential function of holding up the sky so that it will not fall and crush the earth, in effect sacrificing his life so that the cosmos can exist. In death, Pangu offers his body as the substance out of which the visible world is created. The theme of primordial sacrifice, often taking the form of sparagmos [spuh- RAHG-mohs]—the ritual tearing apart of a sacrificial victim, divine or human— plays a significant role in Greek myth, not only in Hesiod’s Theogony but also in narratives about Dionysus and mortal heroes (see Chapter 13). These, and many analogous creation stories from around the world, imply that the universe did not come into being without pain and loss, including the sacrificial suffering of divine beings. A god who, like Uranus, withdraws from the earthly scene or disappears al- together after his creative function is completed, is called a deus otiosus. This shadowy figure, who can be defined as a god “at leisure” or “out of work,” is familiar in the mythology of Africa, Mesoamerica, and ancient Canaan. Some feminist scholars see in the myths of Uranus’s mutilation a remnant of an- cient matriarchal rites in which the primal goddess’s consort was ritually killed (and perhaps eaten) to ensure fertility of flock and field, as well as that of the human community. Etiologically, the episode suggests the mysterious psychological affinity between love and hate, explains the enforced division of masculine and feminine principles in the cosmos, and offers a reason the “starry sky” (Uranus) is so remote and seemingly irrelevant to human affairs. The myth is also a classic illustration of the Freudian domestic psychodrama, a father-son rivalry in which the mother sides with her ambitious male child to subvert the dominance of a tyrannical husband. The Birth of Athene After Zeus, again with Mother Gaea’s help, has succeeded in conquering the Titans and imprisoning most of them in Tartarus, he sets about populating the universe in his own image. Although Zeus sires a prodigious number of divine beings and mortal heroes, Hesiod’s designation of him as “father of gods and men” does not refer to his literal paternity. Zeus is “father” in his role as ruler of the divine patriarchy, protector and defender of the cosmic order. The first of Zeus’s seven successive wives is Metis [MEE-tis], a personification of the Greek word meaning “thought,” or “cunning,” a concept about which the Greeks had mixed feelings, particularly when it involved female astuteness. When Gaea and Uranus warn Zeus that he, too, may have a son strong enough to depose him, Zeus reacts in a way that echoes Cronus’s cannibalism but significantly differs from it: he swallows Metis, already pregnant with their child. Whereas Cronus could ingest but not absorb his children, Zeus successfully incorporates Metis into himself, controlling female cunning by internalizing it as part of his character. By assimilating Metis, Zeus is able personally to give birth to his first child, Athene, a potent manifestation of her father’s creative intelligence (Figure 3-14; see also Figures 1-2 and 1-3; see Chapter 2 for a discussion of theoretical interpretations of this myth.)

This crude but vigorous vase painting effectively illus- trates Hesiod’s tradition of Athene’s birth from the head of Zeus (compare a much later version in Figure 1-2). Athene emerges from Zeus’s skull thrusting a shield before her as Hephaestus gazes in amazement at the result of his ax blow. (British Museum, London) not only the epitome of wisdom, she is also the goddess of victory in war, the inge- nious strategist who outmaneuvers all opponents. As defender of the Greek polls, she teaches the rational arts of logical argument and persuasion, replacing civil strife with disciplined cooperation (see Chapter 15, the Eumenides). Zeus will need to co-opt all of Athene’s qualities because, as the Prometheus myth makes clear, only the acquisition of wisdom—and all the divine attributes that go with it—will protect him from falling as ignominiously as his predecessors. Although he will never again face enemies as formidable as those he defeats early in his reign, Zeus contains in his own patriarchal character the seeds of his potential undoing (see Chapter 14, Prometheus Bound). Even in his own household, Zeus encounters spo- radic opposition, particularly from his sister-wife Hera, a goddess of marriage and domesticity, who may have been worshiped independently before the imposition of patriarchal religion reduced her to the status of Zeus’s consort (Figure 3-15). Hera and Hephaestus Hera’s rivalry with her husband, whose policies she regularly sabotages, appears at the outset of their relationship and pervades virtually all of the myths about her. Hesiod asserts that, as soon as Hera sees Zeus giving birth to Athene, she counters, without any male assistance, by producing a son who is entirely hers, Hephaestus. (Because myth typically operates without regard for chronological sequence, the Parthenon sculptures of Athene’s birth can show Hephaestus as already present on Olympus.) As Athene, Zeus’s favorite child, consistently supports her father, so Hephaestus is his mother’s devoted son, repeatedly taking Hera’s side in his parents’ many quarrels. In some versions of the myth, Hephaestus, the only imperfect Olympian, is born lame; in others, he becomes a cripple after Zeus hurls him down to earth for conspiring with Hera once too often.

In this bas-relief (fifth century B.C.), Hera unveils herself to her new husband.

Although myth affirms the pair’s sexual compatibility, their union is marred by his obsessive infidelities and her unforgiving jealousy.

(For a variant tradition about Hephaestus’s relationship to his mother, see the description of Hera in Chapter 5.) Gaea and Typhoeus Although Hesiod passionately supports a patriarchal society, in heaven as on earth, he seldom underestimates the crucial role of the feminine principle in cosmic history. Gaea, instrumental in every change in divine leadership, ultimately confirms Zeus’s right to rule, but not before she has subjected him to his supreme test. Having contrived Uranus’s downfall and tricked Cronus into vomiting up his children so that they can as- sist in Zeus’s campaign against the Titans, she now presents Zeus with his most for- midable opponent, the monster Typhoeus [tye-FEE-uhs], a Greek version of the an- cient Near Eastern dragon of chaos (Figure 3-16).

In this vase painting, after defeating the Titans, Zeus faces an even greater challenge to his sovereignty, the reptilian monster Ty- phoeus, child of Gaea and Tartarus. Typhoeus, shown here with only one head, is a Greek version of the Mesopotamian dragon of chaos and represents Gaea’s final attempt to circum- vent undisputed male rule of the universe. Originally, this serpent may have been a guardian of the earth goddess, which later myth reinterpreted as a destructive threat to Zeus’s patriar- chal regime. This close-up of Typhoeus shows that the monster’s lower torso ends in serpen- tine coils and that his scaly wings extend to blot out the sun. Although in Flesiod’s account Zeus defeats him with overpowering thunderbolts, other myths indicate that Zeus almost suf- fers defeat from the dragon’s attack. (Antikensammlungen, Munich) in some traditions called Typhon, is deliberately created by his mother’s mating with Tartarus, the abysmal spawning ground of demonic forces. With his hundred reptilian heads, fiery breath, and fierce, predatory shrieks, Typhoeus, who aspires to rule both gods and men, represents a frightening alternative to Zeus’s benevolent despotism. Some commentators note that Typhoeus, whom Fdesiod depicts as an incarnation of cosmic evil, may be a distorted picture of the guardian serpent that was once associ- ated with the worship of a prehistoric goddess, before she was dethroned by male sky gods (see Chapter 4). Other scholars suggest that Fdesiod’s description of the conflagra- tion that ravages earth during Zeus’s war with Typhoeus expresses not only a patriarchal assault on Gaea but also a faint memory of some distant geological catastrophe, such as devastating prehistoric eruptions of Mount Etna or Thera (Santorini). Fiesiod portrays Zeus defeating Typhoeus by merely summoning the full might with which he had vanquished the Titans, but later traditions emphasize the great difficulty Zeus had in subduing this embodiment of universal disorder. According to Apollodorus, the cunning monster severs the tendons of Zeus’s hands and feet and hides them, rendering the god impotent (a variation of Uranus’s emasculation) until Zeus’s clever son Fdermes restores them to his father. In an elaboration from the fifth century A.D., Typhoeus steals Zeus’s thunder and lightning, as well as his tendons, making the outcome of this battle between good and evil even more uncertain.

One tradition, preserved in Aeschylus’s Promethetis Bound, states that Zeus finally defeated Typhoeus by burying him beneath Mount Etna, Europe’s largest and most active volcano. This etiological myth explains Etna’s fiery outbursts as manifestations of Typhoeus’s convulsive struggles to escape from his underground prison. Hesiod s Worldview In his attempt to synthesize ancient Near Eastern and native Greek traditions into an orderly account of the Greek gods’ complex ancestry, functions, and kinships, Hesiod pictured a universe that is inherently contradictory. The primal Void (Chaos) is the unlikely source of an exuberant proliferation of life that culminates in Zeus’s joyous begetting of both mortal heroes and deathless gods, figures who will dominate the mythic environment. Each stage of cosmic development, however, is marked by acts of appalling violence—mutilation, cannibalism, treachery, war—illustrations of strife’s power to trigger conflict on both the divine and human levels. Yet, even while celebrating the chief Olympian’s ultimate triumph as the “bringer of good,” Hesiod is deeply pessimistic about the human scene. He envisions a deteriorating world in which Zeus’s reign inaugurates a progressive social and moral decline that imposes poverty and suffering on most of the god’s human subjects (see Chapter 6)."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"THEOQONY' Hesiod [The MUSES, who dwell on heavenly Mount Olympus, appear visibly to the poet on Mount Helikon.] I begin my song with the Helikonian Muses; they have made Helikon, the great god-haunted mountain, their domain; their soft feet move in the dance that rings the violet-dark spring and the altar of mighty Zeus.

But when Zeus gave the three gods what strengthens the body, 430 the very nectar and ambrosia of the gods, and they drank nectar and ate exquisite ambrosia, then the spirit rose bold in the hearts of all, and Zeus, the father of gods and men, spoke and said: “Listen to me, noble sons of Ouranos and Gaia, for I wish to speak out what spirit and heart command. So far the divine Titans and the gods Kronos sired have fought against one another every day and far too long for victory and power. Now in this bitter battle give the Titans proof 440 of the unyielding strength in your invincible arms. Remember our noble friendship and the pains you suffered until, through plans we conceived, you came up to the light again out of cruel chains and murky darkness.” So he spoke, and blameless Kottos gave this answer: “Lord Zeus, you speak of things that are not unknown, for we know full well that your mind is sharp and that you defined the gods against dread disaster. O Lord and son of Kronos it is through plans conceived by you that we, sore from unexpected pains, 450 came back up again out of cruel chains and murky darkness. For this, with unbending mind and shrewd resolve, we shall battle the Titans with might and main, to defend your power in the savage clash.” So he spoke, and the gods, givers of blessings, heard and acclaimed his words. Then more than ever before they yearned for war and they fought a fierce battle on that day, all of them, both male and female: the divine Titans and the gods Kronos sired, and those whom Zeus from Erebos brought up into the light, 460 the dread and mighty ones, whose strength was matchless.

As patriarchal sys- tems overseen by male sky gods replace the older matriarchal ones, the Great Goddess is typically divided, and her three aspects are parceled out among separate goddesses who are subordinated to the male gods. In Greek my- thology, the primordial goddess is Gaea, whose functions under the Olym- pian system are most completely syncretized in the figure ofiDemeter. Her importance is emphatically revealed in the Eleusinian Mysteries performed in her honor. The individual functions of the Great Goddess, divided and redefined in their relation to men, are variously assimilated into such fig- ures as Hera, Athene, Aphrodite, Artemis, and Hecate.

Stone Age figures of the Great Goddess typically depicted her as pregnant and with enlarged breasts, illustrating her role as creator and sustainer of life. This small (4f) limestone sculpture, found in Aus- tria and dating from approximately 30,000-25,000 B.C., is characteris- tic of Stone Age goddess figures. (Museum of Natural History, Austria) sometimes used to distinguish this singular, primordial figure from later goddesses who incorporated some of her functions. She was perceived as a powerful, creative force who, by parthenogenesis (conception without sex), gave birth to the universe. Although discussions of classical myths have, through the ages, emphasized the male gods, recent feminist scholars, both male and female, have revealed a new understand- ing (widely accepted but still the subject of occasional controversy) of the significance of the female goddess. The extensive research of modern archaeologists has demon- strated that from the Paleolithic (Old Stone Age, 30,000—7000 B.C.) through the Bronze Age (4000—1000 B.C.) in Europe, images of the Great Goddess abound, yet few images of warriors or heroes dating from before the Bronze Age have been found. There is no evidence to suggest that worship of a female creator goddess necessitated or corresponded with a matriarchal social organization. Nevertheless, long before the invention of agriculture in the Neolithic (New Stone Age, 6500—3500 B.C.) period, the Great Goddess prevailed and was worshiped for her capacity to create and sustain life (Figure 4-1)."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"The Great Goddess and the Goddesses 99 FIGURE 4-2 Artemis of Ephesus.

The earliest images depict her with enlarged breasts and abdomen; she is often shown as pregnant and sometimes in the act of giving birth, symbolizing her power to create and nourish (Figure 4-2)."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"100 The Myth ic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes The Three Functions of the Great Goddess In these early images, the Great Goddess was not associated with love or sex. Perhaps before humans understood the precise male role in procreation, the female ability to create life from within herself seemed magical. The Great Goddess was typically as- sociated with three functions—the source of life, of death, and of transhguration or rebirth. Her triple nature is repeated in the patterns of heaven-earth-Underworld and maiden-mother-old woman. Uniting opposites within herself, the Great God- dess encompasses both light and darkness, both upper and lower worlds, embracing the totality of the cycle of birth, death, and renewal in all its aspects—the terrifying along with the beneficent. Later, after humans understood the life cycle of plants and learned to plant, grow, and harvest food, she was also identihed as the grain goddess or earth goddess—responsible for the growth, death, and rebirth of vegetation— who now added these functions to the primal one of maintaining the eternal cycle of life, death, and regeneration. Symbols of the Great Goddess Although the guises in which the Great Goddess appears in myths throughout the world vary, certain key images remain constant, suggesting that these are recurring symbols of an archetypal female principle shared by humans in all times and cultures. Among the key symbols, perhaps the most prominent is the serpent (Figures 4-3, 4-4, and 4-5). Grawling underground as well as on the surface, the snake is privy to the mysteries of the Underworld, to the magic that transforms seeds into plants, and to the secrets of life, death, and rebirth. Because it sheds its skin each spring after a period of hibernation, the snake also symbolizes immortality, visually embodying the continuity of the eternal cycle. To emphasize that connection, the snake is some- times depicted with its tail in its mouth. A related symbol is the tree (or its variants, the pillar or column)—the Tree of Life, or the World Tree, with its roots in the Underworld and its branches in the heavens, often depicted with the serpent twined around its trunk (Figure 4-6). The Great Goddess is also associated with the moon, whose cycles of waxing and waning approximate the menstrual cycle, while the swelling of the moon from the crescent of the new moon to its full state suggests the swelling of the womb in preg- nancy; therefore, the worldwide connection of the moon with womens fertility is not surprising. Moreover, the moon then disappears from view for several nights and is “reborn” to begin the lunar cycle anew, a pattern reflected in the many myths depict- ing the lunar goddess who mourns for a lover or child who dies or descends to the Underworld, or who descends herself and then returns to the upper world or arranges for the return/rebirth of the child or lover. The lunar cycle, recapitulating the cycle of life, death, and rebirth, creates a link between the physical and spiritual realms of existence. Some mythographers even speculate that the impulse of humans to engage in mythmaking is initially inspired by their imaginative response to the lunar cycle. Visible against the night sky, the moon also unites contradictory elements, light and darkness, unlike the sun, whose blinding light obliterates darkness. Other symbols include various forms of the vessel (water jar, vase, pot, oven, chest, chalice, grail), which depict the body of the Great Goddess and which often were"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"The Great Goddess and the Goddesses 101 FIGURE 4-3 Atargatis, or Dea Syria. One of the many deities imported by the Romans as they enlarged their empire by conquest, this Syrian goddess is another variant of the almost universal Great Goddess. She is linked in this bronze sculpture with two of her most important symbols: the serpent and the tree. Both the serpent (which can pene- trate the secrets of the Underworld and also renew itself by shedding its skin) and the tree (which bears fruit annually after a period of dormancy) symbolize the Goddess’s power of rebirth or renewal, typically combined on this figure. The snake surrounds the goddess as it would the trunk of a tree so that her body, embraced by the serpent, figuratively becomes the Tree of Life. As in Figures 4-4 and 4-5, the serpent is depicted as a beautiful and benevolent creature. (National Museum ofTerme, Rome) decorated with breasts and abdomen. As vessel, her body becomes the womb of cre- ation, container of the waters of life. Thus, a descent to the Underworld becomes a return to the womb of the Great Goddess, the source of all, a journey sometimes archetypally identified as a descent into the unconscious. As some scholars have noted, in many locations in Europe and Asia Minor, from Paleolithic-era cultures to civilizations as sophisticated as that of the Minoans on Crete, shrines to the Great Goddess were located in caves. Other common goddess symbols include birds (whose flight links earth and sky), the sow (an image of fecundity), and the cow (a source of nourishment and sustainer of life, whose horns recapitulate the shape of the crescent moon). In the earliest fig- ures, the body of the Great Goddess is often inscribed with lozenge shapes, frequently with a dot inside, perhaps representing the seed in the field.

(Heraklion Museum, Knossos) scholars speculate that this division may reflect, at least in part, the invasion of Europe by martial Indo-European cultures with their weapon-bearing male gods, whose sym- bols are linear and phallic—spears, swords, thunderbolts, and other weapons. Some evidence suggests that the relationship between the Goddess and these male deities may have been perceived as cooperative.

Thus, the Goddess’s triple aspects as maiden—mother—old woman are redefined from the patriarchal perspective—in their relation to men—as virgin—wife—mistress/whore and embodied in separate figures such as Athene, Hera, and Aphrodite. The reign of patriarchy among the gods gives rise to a new archetype, the hero. In contrast to the feminine archetype, the masculine model of experience, focused on the singular achievements of a unique individual, is linear, not cyclical, making death terrible and final. Thus, the hero, whose primary role is to escape mortality and achieve personal transcendence, becomes necessary. From this new perspective, the feminine archetype is a threat that must be counteracted. The association of the sun with the male deities typically creates a system of dualism in which the universe becomes an arena of combat between opposing forces: the sky gods of light and the sun are portrayed as “good,” whereas the forces of darkness, including the Under- world functions of the Great Goddess, are seen as “evil.” Thus, the snake becomes a dragon, with whom gods and heroes alike must do battle."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"104 The Myth ic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes FIGURE 4-6 Heracles in the Garden of the Hesperides. The Greek hero Heracles engages in several battles with serpents. To the male hero, unlike the goddesses (see Figures 4-3 through 4-5), the serpent is a threat, and he must either kill it (as Heracles does in some versions of this myth) or seduce its female guardians before he can acquire the Golden Apples of Im- mortality. It is notable that the hero—typically not satisfied with rebirth through children, through spiritual renewal in this life, or through the hope of resurrection in the hereafter— wants his immortality literally and is willing to risk the potentially fatal encounter with the serpent to obtain it. In this Athenian vase painting (fifth century B.C.), Heracles rests after his journey to the land of the setting sun, where the Greek version of the Tree of Life grows, guarded, of course, by a serpent. Heracles apparently has charmed the Hesperides (the nymphs who guard the Golden Apples that grow on that tree) into giving him one.

She includes all levels of the cosmos within herself, mediating between the upper and lower worlds, between light and darkness, and between life and death. It is she who is the source of the physical universe, in- cluding the sky, personified as the god Uranus. As with many creation myths, the story of Gaea’s creation describes a process of separation and dififerentiation.

Borrowing the names of the Greek gods, Freud portrayed this contradictory state as tension between Eros, the life force, andThanatos— a fter the Greek god of death—the return to the peace of the womb that is the death wish. In the Greek creation myth, however, it is Eros himself who ignites the desire that brings the universe as we know it into being, but it is also Eros whose universal amorous influence drives male and female gods toward reconnecting with their opposites. The tension between these two opposing impulses—male and female—is re- flected in worldwide myths in a variety of ways—as an expanding and contracting universe undergoing repeated cycles of creation and destruction; as gods or heroes who desire erotic reunion with the feminine force while pursuing ego-preserving or power-enhancing goals, often at the expense of the females and children in their lives; or as heroes who strive to attain the immortal condition of the male sky gods only to find that they must descend to the (feminine) Underworld in order to make the attempt. When Gaea creates the universe out of her wholeness, life happens, in all its glorious complexity, and with it the tensions between feminine and masculine, earth and sky, goddess and god, parent and child. At the second stage of the Greek creation myth, as if acknowledging this tension, Gaea takes a step in the direction of compromising with the masculine principle by acknowledging the male role in conception. According to Hesiod, she mates with Uranus and gives birth to offspring that include both deities (the Titans) and mon- sters (the Cyclopes and the Hundred-Handed) whom Uranus imprisons in the Un- derworld—the womb of the goddess—thus preventing the usurpation of his own powers by undoing hers, reversing the birth process. Gaea and Her Consort Though Uranus now nominally reigns as king of the gods, it is clearly Gaea who retains her functions as the source of life and death, conspiring with her children to overthrow Uranus by castrating him while he is making love to her—his desire for erotic reunion with the goddess undermining his impulses toward the augmentation of his own separate powers. (In later myths and related rituals, the male god or con- sort, sometimes in the form of an animal such as a horned bull, often must undergo sparagmos, a ritual in which he must be dismembered—and commonly eaten raw— to ensure the renewal of life.) Gaea’s bonds are clearly with her children, and her commitment is to the continuity of the cycle, whereas Uranus, whose interest is in the acquisition and maintenance of his personal power, sees his potentially violent children as personal threats and so imprisons them. Although from the masculine perspective this scene of primal violence might reflect the sons’ Oedipal envy of their father, from the feminine point of view it perpetuates the power of the goddess, dispensi ng with the male after his biological function as provider of semen is fulfilled. The pattern of domination of the violent male by the goddess who bonds with her children is continued in the relationship of Rhea and Cronus, who, in turn, are over- thrown by Zeus."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"106 The Mythic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes FIGURE 4-7 The Gorgon. As long as death is perceived as part of the ongoing cycle of life, death, and rebirth, the Great Goddess’s serpent is por- trayed as a beneficent creature. Once the patriarchal perspec- tive takes hold, however, death becomes the final blow to the hero’s ego, and the Goddess’s Underworld functions come to seem terrifying. The once- beautiful serpent is now trans- formed into the hero’s per- petual enemy, the dragon. The Goddess herself, in her death- related functions, is similarly transformed. The Greek Gor- gons, three women with snakes for hair, were called Sthenno, Euryale, and Medusa (whose eyes turned men to stone). In this marble relief from the temple of Artemis at Corfu (sixth century B.C.), we see a Gorgon, whose bulging eyes, protruding tongue, and hair of snakes, along with her belt of entwined snakes, render her a truly hideous figure. (Museum ofGorfu) The Subordination of the Great Goddess Zeus’s last battle, after his successful war with his father and the rest of the Titans, is with the dragon Typhoeus (see Chapter 3), a belated, patriarchal revision of the World Serpent who incorporates the feminine archetype. Under Zeus’s Olympian regime, the patriarchal gods are in hrm control. Gaea largely evaporates from view, her triple functions most often syncretized with Demeter or divided into separate functions, each reinterpreted from the male perspective. The Great Goddess in her chthonic [THOEl-nik], death-wielding aspect is transformed by the pattiarchal sys- tem into a hideous old hag, such as the Gorgon (Figure 4-7), or into a witch, such as Hecate. Earlier images of the Goddess include the spider as a weaver of the intricate web of life, which often took the shape of the sun disk (compare, for example. Grand- mother Spider, the Cherokee creator goddess who captures the sun and brings light to the world). But now such images are transformed into threats of entrapment— the web, the net, the noose—wielded by the beautiful-but-deadly spider-woman who imprisons the free male, or the terrifying old woman who paralyzes him in place by turning him to stone, symbolically repressing the unconscious forces the feminine archetype invokes. The other aspects of the Great Goddess (maid, mother) are rein- voked in forms clearly subordinate to Zeus: Athene, whose divine wisdom is now reborn out of the mind of Zeus; Hera, whose protection of the institution of marriage supports the patriarchal social structure; and Aphrodite, in whom the creative cosmic energy of Eros is reduced to the spirit of sexual pursuit and gratification. Despite the"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"The Great Goddess and the Goddesses 107 official subordination of the feminine, however, the fear of the castrating goddess remains. The god of war himself. Ares, so glorious on the battlefield, is more easily humili- ated in the bedroom, is outwitted by the love goddess’s nonathletic husband, He- phaestus (see Chapter 5), and literally trapped in the invisible but binding web of sexual desires and jealousies. Similarly, human warrior-heroes such as Heracles and Jason, who model themselves on Ares, will continue to be undone whenever they enter the world of the feminine (see Chapter 10). The Great Goddess Divided Although reconciled under patriarchal rule with the reign of the male gods, the other Olympian goddesses, individually, retain some of the Great Goddess’s characteristics and symbols. Three of her aspects are reconstituted as virgin (Athene), wife (Hera), and lover (Aphrodite), while her chthonian aspects are embodied separately in god- desses such as Hecate and Artemis. Athene Athene [uh-THEE-nuh] retains the role of the Great Goddess as a source of wisdom; further, despite her condition as virgin goddess, she is also invoked during childbirth. Descended, like Hera, from the Cretan snake goddess, she continues to bear the serpent of the Goddess behind her shield and the Gorgon’s head on its front. Her other symbols, the owl and other birds, are likewise associated with the Goddess. Portrayed as the inventor of the domestic arts of pottery and weaving, Athene is thus symbolically associated with the Goddess as vessel and as spinner of fate. Born from the head of Zeus, Athene appears fully grown and, as goddess of defen- sive war, fully armed with masculine weapons (see Chapter 3). Guided by wisdom enforced with strength, she helps all the important heroes as they defend their fami- lies and cities. Thus, Athene combines the strength and aggression of the male arche- type with the commitment to family and the domestic bonds of the female: she bears the shield of the god but keeps the serpent of the goddess in reserve behind it (Figure 4-8). As portrayed in the myth of her birth, the divine intellect must incor- porate the female archetype in order to carry out its tasks. Hera The most powerful of the Olympian goddesses, Hera [HEE-ra] is the only one to retain the creative power of parthenogenesis originally possessed by Gaea, albeit with somewhat diminished effectiveness, since she produces by that method only the un- gainly Hephaestus (see Chapter 5). Possibly descended from the Cretan snake god- dess (see Figure 4-4), Hera is said to renew her virginity every spring as naturally as a serpent sheds its skin. She retains the Great Goddess’s features as patron of child- birth—a function doubled in her daughter Eileithyia, also a childbirth goddess— and her portrayal as “cow-eyed” connects her with the Great Goddess as Queen of"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"108 The Mythic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes FIGURE 4-8 Athene Parthenos.

Hera is interpreted under the patriarchy as the goddess of marriage. Thus, she is subject to a double standard of judging sexual behavior. She remains, as expected, sexually loyal to Zeus, while he constantly betrays her with other females, as well as males, both divine and human. According to some mythographers, his first extra- marital affair was with lo, a priestess of Hera. Zeus turns lo into a heifer to protect her from the anger of Hera. (In some variants, it is Hera who turns lo into a cow to prevent her rape by Zeus, who then comes to lo in the form of a white bull.) When all ruses and preventions fail, a furious Hera sends a gadfly to torment the heifer; the gadfly pursues her all the way to Egypt, where she is credited with spreading the worship of Demeter. Some versions even conflate lo with the Egyptian goddess Isis,"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"The Great Goddess and the Goddesses 109 who is often portrayed as the traditional “horned goddess.” Although in this tale Hera and lo are rivals, some scholars see lo as a variant of Hera, who is also a cow god- dess—a white cow married to Zeus in the form of a white bull. Hera’s power, manifest in her ability to metamorphose her rivals into animals, is also revealed in her ability to drive heroes like Heracles insane (see Chapter 10). Despite her power, she is portrayed under Zeus’s regime as the stereotype of the nagging, jealous wife. The tension between Hera’s continuation of some powers of the creator goddess and her subordination under Zeus’s rule is similar to the ambigu- ous status of another cow goddess, the Egyptian goddess Nut (or Hathor, yet another Egyptian cow goddess, whose stories are often conflated with those of Nut). The sun god, Amon-Ra, in his form as a bull, descends into the womb of the goddess, sails all night through her belly, and is born again each morning as a golden calf, the bull calf of the sun, who then grows into a powerful bull, only to repeat the journey each night. The cow goddess who, in earlier myths, sacrificed the bull god to ensure re- newal is now depicted as his mother. The goddess is clearly essential to give birth (and rebirth) to the god. But the calf she bears each morning rules her world, and she is subordinated. Hera exists in a similarly complex relationship with Zeus. As Zeus’s wife, Hera reinforces marriage as a social institution, in effect chartering her own subordination. After an early attempt at rebellion—a failed conspiracy, with Poseidon, to overthrow Zeus—Hera settles down into an uneasy but permanent relationship with her hus- band, reserving her anger for his many children conceived by other females, divine and human. At the same time, her marriage transforms Zeus from an expendable source of conception (as were Uranus and Cronus) to a god of family love (Figure 4- 9) who, unlike his predecessors, maintains positive relationships with his children and whose reign is thus comparatively stable (see Chapter 5). Aphrodite Originally an Asiatic goddess, as Herodotus claims, or, more precisely, related to various Near Eastern goddesses such as the Syrian Atargatis, the Sumerian Inanna (or her Babylonian equivalent, Ishtar), the Canaanite Astarte, or even the Egyptian Isis, Aphrodite [af-roh-DYE-tee] shares many characteristics with these deities, including her connection to the sea—the “waters of life”—and her unusual birth. The Syrian goddess Atargatis, for example, emerges from an egg that has fallen into the Euphrates River and is pushed to shore by fish; Aphrodite herself, according to Hesiod, is born from the foam surrounding the severed genitals of Uranus, which Cronus tossed into the sea. Floating to shore on a clamshell. Aphrodite emerges from the sea as the last outpouring of the primeval gods’ creative energies (see Color Plate 1). Initially a powerful embodiment of Eros, the prime creative force of the universe and its life- principle, Aphrodite was a powerful deity to whom all creation—human and di- vine—was subject (Figure 4-10). Under the auspices of the patriarchy, however, such a powerful force embodied in a female must have aroused some anxiety, for we find two conflicting perceptions of Aphrodite manifested even within Hesiod’s Theogony. On the one hand, in the form of the male figure Eros (later portrayed as Aphrodite’s son), love is the mysterious force that literally makes the world go round and to which the gods themselves"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"110 The Myth ic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes FIGURE 4-9 Zeus and Hera.

(Archeological Museum, Palermo) succumb; on the other, Aphrodite is a silly, flirtatious girl, an appropriate companion to her lover, the athletic but not terribly bright Ares, god of war (see Color Plate 11). As with her birth, her connection to the war god is perhaps a vestige of the dual role as god- dess of love and war of the Near Eastern goddesses from which she derives. An alter- native version of her birth mentioned by Homer describes Aphrodite as a daughter of Zeus and Dione, more firmly subordinating her in the Olympian hierarchy. Perhaps reflecting her connection with the temple prostitutes who would serve in the shrines of the Near Eastern love goddesses. Aphrodite is variously redefined as a flirt who seduces men for the fun of it, as a mistress or lover, or as a whore. Conse- quently, she remains alluring, but her power is drastically diminished: in a world in which marriage is sanctified, she has no legitimate social place. Aphrodite’s own mar- riage, to the lame and singularly unattractive, though highly intelligent, Hephaestus, is a failure: she cheats on him with humans and gods alike (see Color Plate 14). Unlike human wives. Aphrodite has the sexual freedom that, in ancient Greek soci- ety, only men possessed. Aphrodite interacts with humans as well as gods, often with far-reaching and sometimes devastating consequences. She persuades Eros to make Medea fall in love with Jason, for example, enabling Jason to win the Golden Fleece and setting in motion both the successful return of the Argonauts (see Chapter 10) and the ensuing tragedies in Jason’s family (see Chapter 17). And it is Aphrodite’s promise—of the love of the most beautiful woman in the world—to Prince Paris of Troy that sparks the conflagration of the Trojan War (see Chapter 11). That promise is made in ex- change for the gift of a Golden Apple of Immortality from the Tree of Fife belonging to Gaea, once again connecting Aphrodite to the primal goddess herself. Dangerous enough when offering gifts, when she is angry at humans, as she is at Hippolytus (son of King Theseus of Athens), Aphrodite can be deadly.

When she and Anchises prove psychologically incompatible. Aphrodite returns to Olympus, leaving Anchises to raise their son, Aeneas, who, when Troy falls, will have to leave, in succession, his wife, his homeland, and his lover (see Chapter 19). Aphrodite’s affair with Adonis, her most famous human lover, is also a source of grief for both. When the queen of Cyprus boasts that her daughter, Smyrna, is more beautiful than Aphrodite, the goddess gets her revenge by causing Smyrna to seduce and be impregnated by her own father, whom she had gotten drunk. When the father realizes what has happened, he tries to kill his daughter, whom Aphrodite turns into a myrrh tree to save her. When her father splits the tree open with his sword, the beautiful child Adonis emerges. Aphrodite then saves the child by concealing him in a chest, which she gives to Persephone to hide until he grows up. However, Per- sephone falls in love with the boy and refuses to relinquish him. Just as in the story of Demeter and Persephone, a compromise is worked out; Adonis will spend part of each year in the Underworld with Persephone and part in the upper world with Aphrodite. Tricking Persephone, Aphrodite causes Adonis to remain with her in the upper world beyond his allotted time, thus arousing the jealousy of her divine lover. Ares. When Adonis is out hunting. Ares disguises himself as a boar and kills Adonis, whose blood penetrates the Underworld. Transformed by the power of Aphrodite’s love into the blood-red anemone, Adonis emerges again as the flower each spring. Like his Near Eastern counterparts, Tammuz and Osiris, Adonis becomes the subject of a popular cult (see Color Plate 15). Indeed, many details of the Aphrodite-Adonis tale underline the link between Aph- rodite and her Near Eastern sources, allowing us a glimpse of the powers of the Great Goddess that still are sustained beneath the surface of the charming but superficial nymph into which Aphrodite had ostensibly been changed. But not even Zeus can en- tirely negate the power of Aphrodite, and the residue of the Great Goddess keeps sur- facing. Like the Babylonian myth of Ishtar and Tammuz, the tale of Aphrodite and Adonis incorporates the descent to the Underworld and the return to the upper world, in defiance of the Underworld goddess; like the Egyptian myth of Isis and Osiris, it in- corporates the entombing of the male in a tree, his subsequent release when the tree is split, and his resurrection. In all these tales, the transformational role of the ancient Goddess—the giver of life, death, and rebirth—is brought about through the power of love that, dimmed but not obliterated, radiates still from the embrace of Aphrodite. Artemis It is the huntress Artemis [AR-te-mis]—one of the most beautiful of the goddesses (Figure 4-11), but also, as she was sometimes called, “the dangerous one”—who inherits the chthonic aspect of the Great Goddess. Her symbol is the moon, and she is associated with the chthonic goddess Hecate. Self-sufficient and not dependent on men (who must nevertheless appeal to her as patron of the hunt), Artemis has powers that threaten the male hegemony, and she is portrayed as terrifying, even deadly, to men who find themselves attracted to her beauty. Actaeon, for example, a cousin of Dionysus, is turned into a stag and torn apart by his own hounds for spying on Artemis as she is bathing, another variant on the sparagmos theme (Figure 4-12)."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"The Great Goddess and the Goddesses 113 FIGURE 4-11 Artemis of Gabii.

(British Museum, London) (Some writers suggest that Actaeon is a variant of the Florned God, a bull-god, con- sort of the goddess, who, in many cultures that practiced such rituals, was mutilated by women wearing dog masks.) The “Lady of the Beasts” who spends much of her time in the fields and woods, Artemis is associated with the power of instinct, of nature, or of unconscious drives often represented in animal form in dreams (Fig- ure 4-13). She is the guardian of womens mysteries and the initiation of young girls, and she perpetuates the creative function of the primeval Goddess: despite her vir- ginity, she is invoked, like Athene, in childbirth. Like Athene, too, she wields men’s weapons and upholds an image of freedom that human women must have envied. Bearing the same weapon as her twin brother, Apollo, Artemis is the only goddess who cannot effectively be subordinated to Zeus. Hecate In the Theogony, Fiesiod attributes to Hecate [FlEK-uh-tee] the powers of all the gods and considers her the deity most honored by Zeus. She has power associated with both earth and sea and can offer as her gifts fertility of the soil, victory in contests or war, and wealth through fishing, farming, and animal breeding. She is associated with Demeter, both because she helped Demeter in her search for Persephone and because of their shared fertility functions. Because of her Underworld connection, Fiecate is gradually stripped of her posi- tive associations with wealth and plenty and becomes identified exclusively with fear- ful associations. These include night, unlucky places such as crossroads, the moon (a symbol shared with her younger associate Artemis), and witchcraft and sorcery. Un- der patriarchal auspices, the dread goddess—perceived in youth as the beguiling but deadly femme fatale—in old age becomes a witch. Thus, in addition to her connec- tion with the often-fatal Artemis, Fiecate joins the ranks of the Gorgons, the Graiae, the Furies, and other loathsome and fearful inheritors of the death-giving functions of the Great Goddess."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"The Great Goddess and the Goddesses 115 FIGURE 4-14 Demeter and Persephone.

The Rituals in Honor of Demeter The two most important rituals in honor of Demeter reflect her two major functions: as source of the cycle of human life, death, and transfiguration, she inspires the Greater and Lesser Eleusinian Mysteries; as Grain Goddess, the protector of agricul- tural fertility, she is honored in the Thesmophoria. The Eleusinian Mysteries The Eleusinian [el-oo-SIN-ee-uhn] Mysteries were celebrated in the town of Eleusis (where Demeter rested in her wanderings in search of Persephone) and in the nearby city of Athens.

As a result, little is known about the rites performed in the temple at Eleusis itself. Such evidence as exists suggests that the Lesser Mysteries were celebrated earlier in the year in preparation for the Greater Mysteries. The rituals involved fasting, the wearing of costumes, and ritual purification in the sea, with the participants carrying sacrificial pigs. Processions—possibly symbolic of Persephone’s trip to the Under- world or of Demeter’s search for her daughter—would take place along the Sacred Way between Athens and the Temple of Demeter at Eleusis. During the procession, bawdy jokes and obscene gestures would apparently be exchanged, enhancing the fertility component of the rituals. Within the temple, participants would partake of a sacred drink of barley and water. Prayers would be recited and sacred objects re- vealed. Some scholars believe that among the sacred objects revealed during the mys- tery was a single seed of grain. The rite may have included dramatic elements, possibly some form of enactment of a hieros gamos [HYE-rohs GAHM-ohs] (sacred mar- riage), presumably between Zeus and Demeter or Persephone, which would produce a sacred child. The climax of the ritual was undoubtedly the final epiphany of the goddess, when her direct communion with or manifestation to the worshipers would take place. Participating in the ritual, according to the Homeric Hymn to Demeter, enabled the soul to experience, in a direct and emotional way, the connection among death, life, and rebirth—to achieve spiritual renewal in the moment and to look forward confidently to “joy” after death, thus ensuring spiritual, and possibly literal, rebirth and immortality. Demeter and Dionysus The ritual itself may have gradually incorporated elements from the worship of Dionysus, a male counterpart of Demeter and Persephone. Indeed, Demeter’s gift of bread, like Dionysus’s wine, is a sacred symbol of transfor- mation. Certainly, the dramatic elements—the procession and costumes, the ritual- ized jesting, and possibly the reenactment of some events in the myth—were analo- gous to the plays performed during the Dionysian festival (see Chapter 13). Dionysus shares with Demeter and Persephone not only some vaguely feminine attributes (the long, flowing garments and hair, for example) but also the reconciliation of polari- ties— the cyclical process of life, death, and rebirth and the terror and joy of the Bacchic ritual. When Dionysus’s mother, Semele [SEM-uh-lee], was unable to sustain the epiph- any of Zeus in his true form as lightning—the Divine Fire itself—she was burned to death in the flame. For a mere mortal, naked divinity—the godhead seen face-to- face— is destructive. In the mysteries of Demeter, as in those for Dionysus, the ritual provides a mediated form of ecstatic communion with the deity, perhaps less electri- fying than Semele’s direct confrontation, but more appropriate to the human wor- shiper, who can thus experience the love of god and live to tell the tale. The Thesmophoria Unlike the Eleusinian Mysteries, which were open to initiates of both sexes, the Thesmophoria [thes-moh-FOHR-ee-uh], a sowing ritual, was practiced by women only. This ritual involved placing the bodies of sacrificed pigs (symbols of the Great"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"118 The Myth ic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes Goddess) into gullies filled with snakes, along with pinecones and cakes baked in phallic shapes. After three days, properly purified women would be lowered into the pit, reenacting Persephone’s descent to Hades, to retrieve the material, which would then be mixed with the seeds for next year’s crop to ensure plant, animal, and human fertility. The Psychological Components of the Demeter Myth The Mediation of Contraries As described in the Homeric Hymn to Demeter, it is Zeus who arranges for the marriage of Persephone, negotiating the compromise be- tween Hades and Demeter that will allow Persephone to remain for part of the year in the Underworld with her husband and for the other part back on earth with her mother. The myth thus mediates between the self-sufficient Great Goddess and the patriarchy, as well as between life and death. The Greeks referred to the souls of the dead, whose bodies were often buried in clay jars, as those who “rest in the womb of the Goddess.” Clay pots with corn seeds were often kept near the hearth to ensure the renewal of life in the spring. The myth also reconciles the Great Goddess with the patriarchy through the in- stitution of marriage, itself a union of contraries. Presented as legalized rape, since it is ultimately justified by Zeus (see Color Plate 4), Persephone’s marriage brings about her symbolic death and descent to the Underworld. But it also is the occasion for understanding the women’s mysteries and the cycle of existence. Unlike the heroes’ descent to the Underworld, which was the climax of a literally death-defying quest for personal immortality (see Chapter 10), Persephone’s descent results in marriage with Hades. Their marriage achieves a reconciliation of life and death, portrayed as part of a continuing cycle that includes her annual rebirth as she returns to the upper world to be reunited with Demeter. The Feminine Archetype As an embodiment of the feminine archetype. Demeter manifests the threefold nature of the Goddess as mother (creator), as grain goddess (source of sustenance), and as goddess of the mysteries (the link in the process of life, death, and renewal, and the source of spiritual rebirth or transformation). The De- meter myth also repeats the motif of the triple functions in the figures of the mother (Demeter), the maiden (Persephone), and the older woman (Hecate, who helps De- meter locate her missing daughter). Even the role of Persephone as Kore, the Maiden, is tripled; her virginity appears in the three aspects of the goddesses who accompany her to the fields: Athene, who personifies self-sufficient reason; Artemis, who shuns men; and Persephone herself, who is innocent because she is inexperienced. Demeter and Female Values Beyond sharing the functions and symbols of the archetypal female, the myth of Demeter explores feminine values. As contemporary psychologists have noted, the myth upholds a model of self-fulfillment at odds with the independent, autonomous path that the masculine archetype—the hero—per- sonifies. The linear male archetype requires that the hero, a unique individual, sepa- rate himself from others—and from his father in particular—and go out to contend with powerful forces alone. In fact, the characteristic hostility between father and son"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"The Great Goddess and the Goddesses 119 in the archetypal male experience, as exemplified in the myths of Uranus and Cronus, requires the son to define himself by literally or symbolically killing or emasculating his father. In contrast, the female archetype exemplifies the importance of the conti- nuity of the generations, especially the bond between mother and daughter, who must be reunited if life is to continue. The hero, furthermore, achieves his quest by spurning his sexual attraction to women as a “temptation” that would weaken his drive toward immortality. The fe- male, on the other hand, experiences renewal by accepting her sexuality, which allows her to achieve the desired bond with her children: in giving birth. Demeter becomes, in effect, her daughter; in growing up, Persephone becomes her mother. Like many women since, who grow up and have children of their own, only to discover that they share unanticipated links with their mothers (“I’m turning into my own mother!” is a frequent observation), Persephone returns from the Underworld transformed into another version of Demeter, thus joining the endless pattern of such renewals. This ultimate identification of mother and daughter is reflected in the fact that they were referred to collectively as The Two Goddesses and that in many of the rituals their roles were interchangeable. Agriculture and the Source of Civilization The myth goes one step further and presents the female principle as the source of civilization itself via the invention of agriculture. Demeter, having agreed to renew her task as grain goddess, teaches the secrets of life to Triptolemus [trip-TOHL-e- muhs] (Figure 4-16), whose name means “thrice-plowed field” (which may refer to a field ready for planting and/or to Demeter’s having sex with him three times) and who is sometimes identified as the Holy Child of the Eleusinian rite. Demeter gives him a plow and grain seed, instructing him to share the secrets of planting with the rest of the human race. What modern anthropologists call the agricultural revolution derives from this insight, allowing humans to settle into permanent locations while they plant, tend their crops, and await the harvest. It is from these early villages that complex cultures, stable and enduring over time, will develop. Demeter thus presents a rather different perspective on the source of civilization from the equivalent male myth, the story of Prometheus and the theft of fire (see Chapter 6). By giving fire—the divine spark—to men, Prometheus sets them Iree. Men are no longer dependent on Zeus’s lightning and are now able to create both civilization and the technology, including weapons, on which a more aggressive model of civilization will be built. Prometheus’s gift creates antagonism between men and gods, reinforcing a model of hostility and separation, whereas the feminine myth emphasizes bonding and reconciliation—among the gods and between gods and humans. The Demeter Myth and Female Psychology Besides expressing the feminine archetype, the Demeter myth also explores the psy- chology of the individual female as she goes through the life cycle from girlhood to old age, passing from virgin to lover to mother and, eventually, to the wisdom of age"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"120 The Myth ic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes FIGURE 4-16 Demeter, Triptolemus, and Persephone. In this marble relief from Eleusis (hfth century B.C.), Demeter (holding the scepter) and her daughter confide the secrets of agriculture to Trip- tolemus and instruct him to spread the knowledge to the rest of humankind. Humans are thus both blessed by the goddesses and initiated into their mysteries.

In the Homeric Hymn to Demeter, although she cannot literally see what has occurred, Hecate knows a rape when she hears one, and she acts, in defiance of Zeus, to help reunite mother and daughter. The last stage of the life cycle is also expressed by Demeter herself as, searching for her daughter, she goes about disguised as an old woman. The myth addresses the emotional experiences of both mother and daughter as they pass through the stages in the life of a woman. The mother must watch as her child is wrenched from her by the patriarchal institution of marriage and must struggle to restore the bond afterward, albeit under dififerent auspices. The daughter must discard her former home and identity and subordinate herself to a male who now determines her functions, as well as the conditions under which she must live."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"The Great Goddess and the Goddesses 121 But the change involves both gains and losses: the mother, relinquishing her protec- tive bond to her child, gains a new friendship, on equal terms, with a now mature woman like herself; the daughter, losing the comforting protection of a parent, gains at least relative independence and new understanding of herself as an adult woman. The innocent but ignorant Persephone, abducted by Hades, undergoes her first sexual experience: eating the pomegranate, a symbol of sexual knowledge like the fruit eaten by Eve in the Book of Genesis, Persephone has passed on to another stage of feminine experience and cannot go back to the upper world or return to her previous condition of naive virginity. (Another interpretation identifies the pomegranate, with its red juice, as an emblem of the onset of menstruation, with the descent into the Underworld a reflection of a common taboo, practiced in many patriarchal societies, requiring the isolation of the female during the menstrual period.) The result for Persephone, as for Eve, is her first consciousness of herself as a woman and her initia- tion into the mysteries of the life cycle (see Color Plate 2). Like Eve, she has eaten from the Tree of Knowledge (the Tree of Life) and is ready to emerge as an adult woman. No longer dependent entirely on either mother or husband, no longer exclu- sively either somebody’s child or somebody’s wife, she is ready to relate to both on her own terms. Persephone’s new powers reflect her new state—once a naive girl, she has become Queen of the Underworld. Hades also is changed by her presence. Not only has the power of Eros been extended to his dread Kingdom, thus embracing all three levels of the universe, but Hades himself has been transformed from sexual predator to spouse. Albeit under patriarchal auspices, the Underworld is thereby re- claimed, and the complete cycle encompassed by the Great Goddess is restored. The Homeric Hymn to Demeter Most of the “Homeric” hymns, a collection of poems by mostly unknown authors in honor of various deities in the Greek pantheon, were probably composed in the eighth to seventh centuries B.C. (A few may have been composed much later, in the Hellenistic period, between the fourth and second centuries B.C.) Varying in length from a few short lines to full-length narratives, these poems were used at festivals as a prologue to recitations of longer poems or to musical performances and were tra- ditionally attributed to Homer, a doubtful attribution already questioned by Helle- nistic readers. The Homeric Hymn to Demeter, the longest of the poems, probably dates from the seventh century B.C. and is one of our major sources of information about the rituals performed at Eleusis. The Homeric Hymn to Demeter tells the story of the abduction of Persephone by Hades and describes Demeter’s search for her and their eventual reunification. It also describes some of the mystery rites for Demeter celebrated at Eleusis, where Demeter is given refuge during her wanderings. Unlike other versions of the myth, the hymn does not mention Demeter’s gift of agriculture to Triptolemus—the residents of Eleusis described in the poem seem already to engage in plowing—but stresses in- stead the goddess’s promise of rebirth to her worshipers: the cult is presented as an alternative to the literal immortality that Demeter offers to Demophon, child of the king and queen of Eleusis. When his terrified mother interrupts the process of placing him in the Divine Fire, Demeter reveals her true identity to the queen and insists"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"122 The Myth ic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes that a cult be started in her honor. In contrast to the goddess Thetis, who was unable to render her son Achilles fully immortal when she similarly placed him in the Divine Fire (see Chapter 10), thus leaving him a divided self, half-human and half-divine. Demeter offers Demophon, along with the rest of humanity, an alternative path to wholeness, the unity of body and spirit. Her gift is the promise of eternal bliss in the hereafter, through initiation in her Mysteries. The myth thus simultaneously charters the mystery and establishes its functions: as a way of achieving communion with Demeter and as a means of ensuring an alternative to the literal immortality that is too terrifying and too destructive a transformation for humans to undergo."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"HOMERIC HYMN TO DEMETER Author unknown Demeter I begin to sing,t i the fair-tressed awesome goddess, herself and her slim-ankled daughter whom Aidoneust seized; Zeus, heavy-thundering and mighty-voiced, gave her, without the consent of Demeter of the bright fruit and golden sword, as she played with the deep-breasted daughters of Ocean, plucking flowers in the lush meadow—roses, crocuses, and lovely violets, irises and hyacinth and the narcissus, which Earth grew as a snare for the flower-faced maiden in order to gratify by Zeus’s design the Host-to-Many, $ a flower wondrous and bright, awesome for all to see, lO for the immortals above and for mortals below.

For so long hope charmed her strong mind despite her distress. The mountain peaks and the depths of the sea echoed in response to her divine voice, and her goddess mother heard. Sharp grief seized her heart, and she tore the veil on her ambrosial hair with her own hands. She cast a dark cloak on her shoulders and sped like a bird over dry land and sea, searching. No one was willing to tell her the truth, not one of the gods or mortals; no bird of omen came to her as truthful messenger. Then for nine days divine Deo* roamed over the earth, holding torches ablaze in her hands; in her grief she did not once taste ambrosia or nectar sweet-to-drink, nor bathed her skin. But when the tenth Dawn came shining on her, Hekate met her, holding a torch in her hands, to give her a message. She spoke as follows: “Divine Demeter, giver of seasons and glorious gifts, who of the immortals or mortal men seized Persephone and grieved your heart? For I heard a voice but did not see with my eyes who he was. To you I tell at once the whole truth.” Thus Hekate spoke. The daughter of fair-tressed Rheia* said not a word, but rushed off at her side holding torches ablaze in her hands. They came to Helios, observer of gods and mortals, and stood before his horses.

At his rebuke they bore the swift chariot lightly, like long-winged birds. A more terrible and brutal grief seized the heart 90 of Demeter, angry now at the son of Kronos with his dark clouds. Withdrawing from the assembly of the gods and high Olympus, she went among the cities and fertile fields of men, disguising her beauty for a long time. No one of men nor deep-girt women recognized her when they looked, until she came to the house of skillful Keleos, the man then ruler of fragrant Eleusis. There she sat near the road, grief in her heart, where citizens drew water from the Maiden’s Well in the shade—an olive bush had grown overhead— lOO like a very old woman cut off from childbearing and the gifts of garland-loving Aphrodite.

Women are there in the shadowy halls, of your age as well as others born younger, who would care for you both in word and in deed.” They spoke, and the most august goddess replied: “Dear children, whoever of womankind you are, greetings. I will tell you my tale. For it is not wrong 120 to tell you the truth now you ask. Doso’s my name, which my honored mother gave me. On the broad back of the sea I have come now from Crete, by no wish of my own. By force and necessity pirate men led me off against my desire.

I could nurse well a newborn child, embracing it in my arms, or watch over a house. I could spread out the master’s bed in a recess of the well-built chamber and teach women their work.” So spoke the goddess. To her replied at once Kallidike, a maiden unwed, in beauty the best of Keleos’s daughters. “Good mother, we mortals are forced, though it hurt us, to bear the gifts of the gods; for they are far stronger. To you I shall explain these things clearly and name 150 the men to whom great power and honor belong here, who are first of the people and protect with their counsels and straight judgments the high walls of the city.

The girls 170 carried proudly bright jars filled with water and swiftly they reached the great house of their father. At once to their mother they told what they saw and heard.

They found the famed goddess near the road 180 just where they had left her. Then to the house of their father they led her. She, grieved in her heart, walked behind with veiled head. And her dark robe swirled round the slender feet of the goddess. They soon reached the house of god-cherished Keleos, and went through the portico to the place where their regal mother sat by the pillar of the close-htted roof, holding on her lap the child, her young offshoot. To her they raced. But the goddess stepped on the threshold. Her head reached the roof and she filled the doorway with divine light. 190 Reverence, awe, and pale fear seized Metaneira. She gave up her chair and bade the goddess sit down. But Demeter, bringer of seasons and giver of rich gifts, did not wish to be seated on the shining seat. She waited resistant, her lovely eyes cast down, until knowing lambe set out a well-built stool for her and cast over it a silvery fleece. Seated here, the goddess drew the veil before her face. For a long time she sat voiceless with grief on the stool and responded to no one with word or gesture. 200 Unsmiling, tasting neither food nor drink, she sat wasting with desire for her deep-girt daughter, until knowing lambe jested with her and mocking with many a joke moved the holy goddess to smile and laugh and keep a gracious heart— lambe, who later pleased her moods as well. Metaneira offered a cup filled with honey-sweet wine, but Demeter refused it. It was not right, she said, for her to drink red wine; then she bid them mix barley and water with soft mint and give her to drink. 210 Metaneira made and gave the drink to the goddess as she bid. Almighty Deo received it for the sake of the rite. Well-girt Metaneira spoke first among them: “Hail, lady, for I suppose your parents are not lowborn, but noble. Your eyes are marked by modesty and grace, even as those of justice-dealing kings. We mortals are forced, though it may hurt us, to bear the gifts of the gods. For the yoke lies on our necks. But now you have come here, all that’s mine will be yours. Raise this child for me, whom the gods provided 220 late-born and unexpected, much-prayed for by me.

For I know a charm more cutting than the Woodcutter; 230 I know a strong safeguard against a baneful bewitching.” So speaking, she took the child to her fragrant breast with her divine hands. And his mother was glad at heart. Thus the splendid son of skillful Keleos, Demophoon, whom well-girt Metaneira bore, she nursed in the great halls. And he grew like a divinity, eating no food nor sucking [at a mother’s breast]; [For daily well-crowned divine] Demeter anointed him with ambrosia like one born from a god and breathed sweetly on him, held close to her breast. 240 At night, she would bury him like a brand in the fire’s might, unknown to his own parents. And great was their wonder as he grew miraculously fast; he was like the gods. She would have made him ageless and immortal, if well-girt Metaneira had not in her folly kept watch at night from her fragrant chamber and spied. But she shrieked and struck both thighs in fear for her child, much misled in her mind, and in her grief she spoke winged words. “Demophoon, my child, the stranger buries you 250 deep in the fire, causing me woe and bitter cares.” Thus she spoke lamenting. The great goddess heard her. In anger at her, bright-crowned Demeter snatched from the flames with immortal hands the dear child Metaneira had borne beyond hope in the halls and, raging terribly at heart, cast him away from herself to the ground. At the same time she addressed well-girt Metaneira: “Mortals are ignorant and foolish, unable to foresee destiny, the good and the bad coming on them. You are incurably misled by your folly. 260 Let the god’s oath, the implacable water of Styx, be witness, I would have made your child immortal and ageless forever; I would have given him unfailing honor. But now he cannot escape death and the death spirits. Yet unfailing honor will forever be his, because he lay on my knees and slept in my arms. In due time as the years come round for him, the sons of Eleusis will continue year after year to wage war and dread combat against each other.

I myself will lay down the rites so that hereafter performing due rites you may propitiate my spirit.” Thus speaking, the goddess changed her size and appearance, thrusting off old age. Beauty breathed about her and from her sweet robes a delicious fragrance spread; a light beamed far out from the goddess’s immortal skin, 280 and her golden hair flowed over her shoulders. The well-built house flooded with radiance like lightning. She left the halls. At once Metaneira’s knees buckled. For a long time she remained voiceless, forgetting to pick up her dear only son from the floor. But his sisters heard his pitiful voice and leapt from their well-spread beds. Then one took the child in her arms and laid him to her breast. Another lit the Are; a third rushed on delicate feet to rouse her mother from her fragrant chamber. 290 Gathering about the gasping child, they bathed and embraced him lovingly. Yet his heart was not comforted, for lesser nurses and handmaids held him now. All night they tried to appease the dread goddess, shaking with fear. But when dawn appeared, they explained to wide-ruling Keleos exactly what the bright-crowned goddess Demeter commanded. Then he called to assembly his innumerable people and bid them build for fair-tressed Demeter a rich temple and an altar on the rising hill. 300 Attentive to his speech, they obeyed at once and did as he prescribed. It grew as the goddess decreed. But once they finished and ceased their toil, each went off home. Then golden-haired Demeter remained sitting apart from all the immortals, wasting with desire for her deep-girt daughter. For mortals she ordained a terrible and brutal year on the deeply fertile earth. The ground released no seed, for bright-crowned Demeter kept it buried. In vain the oxen dragged many curved plows down 310 the furrows. In vain much white barley fell on the earth. She would have destroyed the whole mortal race by cruel famine and stolen the glorious honor of gifts and sacrifices from those having homes on Olympus, if Zeus had not seen and pondered their plight in his heart.

Then the father sent in turn all the blessed immortals; one by one they kept coming and pleading and offered her many glorious gifts and whatever honors she might choose among the immortal gods. 330 Yet not one could bend the mind and thought of the raging goddess, who harshly spurned their pleas. Never, she said, would she mount up to fragrant Olympus nor release the seed from the earth, until she saw with her eyes her own fair-faced child. When Zeus, heavy-thundering and mighty-voiced, heard this, he sent down the Slayer of Argos* to Erebos with his golden staff to wheedle Hades with soft words and lead back holy Persephone from the misty gloom into the light to join the gods so that her mother 340 might see her with her eyes and desist from anger.

Transformed by the poets to reflect Greek society’s con- cept of aristocratic leadership, the Olympians typically enforce exacting standards of justice in earthly society while enjoying the option to behave capriciously when manipulating human lives. y^ccording to Homer, after Zeus achieved mastery of the universe by vanquishing the Titans, he and his two brothers, Poseidon and Hades, cast lots to divide the world among themselves {Iliad, Book 15). In this apportionment of power, Zeus receives the sky, Poseidon the sea, and Hades the Underworld as their respective domains. The three divine rulers agree to share juris- diction of the earth, assuming equal freedom to intervene in human affairs. In the Theogony, however, with its emphasis on Zeus’s supremacy, Hesiod states that, after Gaea had advised the gods to invite Zeus to rule over them, Zeus himself decided which gods were to govern specific areas or natural phenomena. Leaving little in Zeus’s administration to chance, Hesiod’s account includes no casting of lots. The Divine Family: The Older Olympians Although Homeric myth gives ail of Zeus’s siblings equal access to Mount Olympus, Hades, whose reign is largely confined to the dark nether regions, almost never ap- pears there. Thus, despite being Zeus’s brother, he is not usually counted among the twelve Olympians. When Dionysus, Zeus’s son by the mortal princess Semele, is elevated to Olympus, the number of Olympians is kept at twelve by the demotion of 135"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"136 The Myth ic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes Olympian genealogy Gaea = Uranus Titans Olympians Cronus = Rhea Oceanus Crius Themis Theia Phoebe Coeus Hyperion lapetus Mnemosyne Tethys Zeus = Hera Demeter Hestia Poseidon Hades Ares Hephaestus Athene Apollo Artemis Hermes Aphrodite (Metis) (Leto) (hero) (Maia) (Dione) FIGURE 5-1 Genealogy of Zeus’s Olympian Family. The Greek pantheon consists exclu- sively of close family members, all of whom are descendants of the original divine parents, Gaea and Uranus. The older Olympians—Zeus and his siblings—are offspring of the Titans Cronus and Rhea, while the younger are children of Zeus by various wives or, in the case of Hephaestus, of Hera. The names of Zeus’s wives are enclosed in parentheses beneath the names of their divine offspring. (Hades, who lives in the Underworld, technically is not one of the Twelve.) Zeus’s sister Hestia. (Membership in the Twelve varied slightly in different parts of Greece; see Figure 5-1 for a standard genealogy of the Olympians.) Although the Greeks accepted the existence of many other deities who inhabited earth and sea, only the immediate family of Zeus lived on Olympus: every Olympian is a brother, sister, or child of Zeus. That Greek myth pictures the major gods as constituting an extended family of parents, children, aunts and uncles—with its in- evitable rivalries, conflicts, and sparring for power—is significant. Even at home on Olympus, Zeus is not entirely free of domestic turmoil. As the divine patriarch, he is forced to devote much of his time to settling disputes among quarreling brothers (see the Hymn to Hermes)-, adjudicating among some Olympians’ rival agendas, such as Athene’s and Poseidon’s opposing intentions toward Odysseus (see Chapter 12); and, above all, dealing with Hera’s persistent schemes to thwart his imperial will. On oc- casion, some of Zeus’s nearest and dearest—including not only his wife and his brother Poseidon but also his favorite daughter, Athene—conspire to challenge his authority. In the Iliad, Achilles makes a brief reference to a plot hatched by Hera, Poseidon, and Athene to “bind” Zeus, a conspiracy aborted by the intervention of Achilles’ mother, the sea-nymph Thetis {Iliad, Book 1). After Thetis summons Briareus (also called Aegaeon), one of the hundred-armed giants who had helped Zeus defeat the"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"The Olympian Family of Zeus 137 Titans, the three divine conspirators hastily abandon their project. Homer gives no details about what the three gods hoped to achieve in binding Zeus, but, because the incident appears in the context of the Trojan War, the plotters may have intended to advance the Achaean (Greek) side, which all three supported. Athene’s participation in the attempted coup is surprising, but this deviation from her customary role of dutiful daughter illustrates the fragility of the family bond, even on the heavenly level. Despite intermittent disobedience or even treachery on the part of his closest rel- atives, Zeus generally reigns unopposed, successfully subordinating ail other deities to his administration. Some gods who in early Greek history had enjoyed an existence independent of Zeus are, in the myths of the Archaic and Classical periods, brought under his jurisdiction. As Hesiod reports in the Theogony, some Olympians, such as Aphrodite, were once thought to have appeared long before Zeus was born. As gen- erations of poets, including Homer, emphasized the supremacy of Zeus, however, these older gods were refashioned as Zeus’s siblings or children, effectively placing them under his control. Such figures as Aphrodite, Poseidon, Artemis, and Hermes, who in prehistoric and Mycenaean times may have been Zeus’s peers, were trans- formed during the Archaic and Classical periods into dependent family members supporting his patriarchy. In the eighth century B.C., Homer and Hesiod helped to establish the character and functions of the Olympians; during the later Archaic and Classical periods, Greek artists defined their physical appearance. The older generation of Zeus and his siblings, the six children of Cronus and Rhea, were depicted as physically mature, an unchanging perfection of middle age. Although retaining the superb musculature of the athlete, Zeus and his brothers have the full beards and thick, flowing locks that proclaim their patriarchal status and their membership in the age group that typically governs society. Zeus’s sisters—Hera, Demeter, and Hestia—are similarly portrayed as majestic, with the ample proportions of feminine maturity. The following brief sketches review the gods’ salient qualities and summarize some of their characteristic myths. More complete stories about the gods and heroes appear in the narrative poems and plays anthologized in this text. The gods’ Latin name(s), which may be more familiar to many readers, are included in parentheses after the Greek name. Zeus (Jupiter, Jove) The closest that Greek religion came to conceptualizing a supreme being, Zeus is the awe-inspiring King of Heaven, the champion of justice, sworn oaths, and lawful order (Figure 5-2). An Indo-European sky god, Zeus is “the cloud-gatherer,” the force that generates storms and incinerates opponents with thunderbolts. The most ethically developed Olympian, Zeus represents the ultimate court of appeal to whose judgments both men and gods must submit. Unlike the Judeo- Christian or Islamic God, however, Zeus is neither omniscient nor all-powerful. His relation to Fate, the irresistible power of Necessity that directs the flow of history, is ambiguous. In many myths. Fate is a force superior to the gods; in the Homeric poems, Zeus almost always refrains from even contemplating a change in the heroes’ individual destinies. For a fleeting moment, he is tempted to save from an early death his mortal son Sarpedon, an exceptionally brave and noble warrior who fought against the Greeks in the Trojan War.

If this fifth- century B.c. bronze represents Zeus, the bearded patriarch is about to hurl a thunderbolt, the ultimate weapon by which he enforces his will. The epitome of masculine dignity, the King of Heaven has conquered all rivals, including his father and Gaea’s chaotic serpent Typhoeus. His is the power that keeps the universe in moral equilibrium. (NationalMuseum, Athens) means the right” or “established custom”), Zeus also sires Lawfulness (Eunomia), Justice (Dike), and Peace (Eirene), indicating that Zeus is the force that keeps the cosmos, including his household of fractious, egocentric deities, operating in relative harmony. Because Zeus is a compendium of amoral nature, symbolized by the thunderbolt, and a projection of Greek patriarchal leadership, his character is correspondingly paradoxical. Warring against his imperial dignity as king, husband, father, and judge is Zeus’s apparently uncontrollable sexual appetite, which compels him to pursue virtually every attractive person — mortal or immortal, male or female—within his considerable reach. In the Theogony, Hesiod validates this aspect of Zeus’s character by highlighting the cosmic benefits of his divine hero’s compulsive promiscuity. Zeus’s extramarital affairs with goddesses, nymphs, and mortal women produce sons and daughters of extraordinary superiority. Who could object to liaisons that result in such gods as Apollo and Artemis, or heroes such as Perseus and Heracles? In"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"140 The Myth ic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes cataloguing Zeus’s conquests and their offspring, Hesiod informs us that the chief Olympian’s sexual adventures not only enrich the human gene pool with heroic stock but also populate the cosmos with beings who represent the highest values of civili- zation. Thus, Zeus begets such progeny as the Muses, who inspire all the creative arts, and other divine abstractions, including the Graces, personifications of beauty and charm, and the Seasons, guarantors of cosmic order. Without Zeus’s virile generosity in siring these children, Hesiod implies, the universe would be no better than it was under the generally uncivilized Titans. In modern astronomy, Zeus’s amorous conquests have been commemorated in the sixteen moons circling our solar system’s largest planet, which bears Zeus’s Latin name, Jupiter. Taking their cue from classical mythology, astronomers have named each of Jupiter’s satellites after one of Zeus’s lovers: these include Europa, a mortal woman whom he abducted in the form of a white bull; Callisto, a nymph who was part of Artemis’s virgin retinue until Zeus seduced her and she was changed into a bear; lo, a mortal virgin whom Zeus brutally raped in the form of a bull (see Chap- ter 14); and Ganymede, a handsome Trojan youth whom Zeus desired and, in the guise of an eagle, seized and carried off to Olympus (Figure 5-3). The only one of Zeus’s lovers permanently installed in heaven, Ganymede was made cupbearer of the gods, pouring out wine at Olympian banquets. If future astronomers discover additional moons orbiting Jupiter, they are unlikely to run out of lovers’ names to bestow on them. Some ancient mythographers tallied no fewer than 115 different objects of Zeus’s widely distributed affections. The god’s lust, which is at once the instinctual “shadow” of Zeus’s ostensibly rational persona and a projection of his will to control and dominate, at times pro- duces a comic spectacle. Myth shows heaven’s love-obsessed emperor sneaking about in disguise, abandoning his divine splendor to assume the form of a bull, swan, ser- pent, or eagle, images of the nonhuman power he represents—all in the (usually vain) hope to escape his wife’s ever-watchful eye. Although his desire can be cruelly exploitative, as it is with the unfortunate lo, many poets depict the divine king hu- morously, as henpecked by Hera at home and driven by an indefatigable libido abroad. Although the myths recounting Zeus’s amorous adventures may serve to uphold a double standard that permits men greater sexual freedom than women, they also remind us of the enormous variety and complexity of humanity’s sexual nature. In Greek myth, Eros and Aphrodite overwhelm even the gods. Hera (Juno) The Queen of Heaven, Hera [HEE-ra] ranks highest among the Olympian goddesses (Figure 5-4). Despite her exalted status, however, myth depicts Hera as leading a frustrating and generally unhappy existence, largely because her priorities collide head-on with the will of Zeus, her husband and brother. Nor was Hera’s childhood a secure and pleasant experience: along with Poseidon, Hades, Hestia, and Demeter, she was swallowed alive by her father, Cronus. Only when her mother, Rhea, be- guiled Cronus into regurgitating his children did her life begin, and then she was sent to live with foster parents, Oceanus and Tethys, while Zeus battled Cronus and his Titan allies.

Shown striding forward in a rush to enjoy his prize, Zeus manifests the classical Greek attraction toward the physical beauty of young men.

Grateful for their protection during her youth, Hera is said to have rec- onciled the couple after they had been divided by a bitter quarrel. Unfortunately, Hera is less successful—and apparently much less diplomatic—in mediating differences in her own marriage to Zeus. vAlthough she is the patron of weddings, wives, marriage, and family life, Hera rarely shares her husband’s viewpoint and tries to subvert his plans whenever possible. In a famous incident from the Iliad (Books 14-15), Hera determines to manipulate events so that the Greeks will thor- oughly trounce the Trojans, whom she fervently hates (see Chapter 11). Accordingly, she borrows Aphrodite’s erotically charmed girdle, wearing it to seduce her husband and thereby distract his attention from the war. The couple make love atop lofty Mount Ida, which Zeus swathes in a thick cloud to ensure their privacy.

As the god- dess of marriage and marital fi- delity, Hera finds herself in an unending war against her brother- husband s promiscuity. Because her function is to uphold family values and punish those who vio- late them, she typically appears as an angry persecutor of Zeus’s in- numerable mistresses and their children. (Vatican Museums, Rome) furious, reminding Hera of the occasion on which he used his superior strength to suspend her from Olympus by her wrists, with huge iron anvils tied to her feet! Hera also acts to spite Zeus when, in retaliation for his producing Athene without her aid, she—without his participation—conceives and gives birth to Hephaestus. The only Olympian goddess who retains the Great Goddess’s parthenogenetic ability, Hera pays for her attempt to upstage Zeus’s patriarchal self-sufficiency. In some ver- sions of the myth, Hephaestus is born crippled, the only physically imperfect Olym- pian, and in disgust Hera throws the newborn out of heaven. Landing on the volcanic island of Lemnos, where the inhabitants care for him, Hephaestus later avenges him- self on his unaffectionate mother by designing and sending Hera a golden throne. Once seated on the throne, Hera is a prisoner: Hephaestus has contrived a golden chain that automatically wraps about the throne’s occupant, holding her immobile. Only when Dionysus seeks him out, gets him drunk, and leads him back to Olympus does Hephaestus reluctantly consent to release his mother (see Figure 8-10). Despite her role as celestial wife, Hera is not a maternal figure, and Greek artists never depict her, as the Egyptians portrayed Isis, as a tender mother holding her child. In some accounts, the only child that she and Zeus produce is Ares, the ill-tempered war god, who is a fitting symbol of his parents’ contentious union. In others, the"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"The Olympian Family of Zeus 143 royal couple also produce Eileithyia [ye-lye-THYE-ya], a goddess of childbirth, and Hebe [HEE-bee], a personification of blooming youth whom Zeus later replaces with Ganymede as the Olympians’ cupbearer. Interestingly, myth depicts none of the Olympian goddesses as prolific mothers who bear many children: Hestia, Athene, and Artemis remain virgins; and Demeter, for all her maternal devotion to Persephone, produces only two or three children. Even Aphrodite, the personification of sexuality and fertility, has few offspring. Al- though some myths make Eros (Cupid) her son by Ares, in Hesiod’s Theogony Eros is a primal god who existed long before Aphrodite’s birth. In perhaps a majority of her myths, Hera appears as a jealous and vindictive wife: unable to punish her straying husband directly, she ferociously persecutes his mis- tresses and their illegitimate children. Outraged at Zeus’s infidelities, which she re- gards as insults to her dignity, Hera tries to kill the infant Heracles (Hercules) and, failing that, imposes on the adult hero a series of grueling labors. She also attempts to prevent Eeto, pregnant with Apollo and Artemis, from giving birth and arranges to have Semele, then carrying Dionysus, burned alive (see Chapter 8). Hera’s lack of sisterly feeling, even for innocent victims of Zeus’s lust, and her unforgiving perse- cution of the noble Aeneas led Virgil, Rome’s greatest poet, to ask, “Is vindictiveness an attribute of the celestial mind?” While acknowledging that Homeric and other myths emphasize Hera’s unattrac- tive qualities, it is important to remember that her behavior may embody a reaction to the patriarchal usurpation of the Great Goddess’s rights and privileges. Zeus’s im- perious refusal to be faithful to Olympus’s highest goddess serves to assert the male god’s complete independence of the divine female. At the same time, Hera’s cosmic importance is voiced in a myth about the newborn Heracles. In this tale, Hermes finds Hera asleep and stealthily places the infant Heracles at the goddess’s breast. When the baby begins to nurse, however, Hera awakens, thrusting Zeus’s son aside before he can absorb the milk of immortality. But it is too late: a powerful jet of Hera’s milk streams across the night sky, igniting thousands of brilliant stars. Visible every clear night, the Milky Way bears silent tribute to heaven’s troubled queen, form- ing a display more impressive than the endless circling of Jupiter’s lonely moons (see Color Plate 3). Poseidon (Neptune) As Zeus compels obedience with his thunderbolts, so Poseidon [poh-SYE-duhn] uses the trident, a huge three-pronged spear with which he generates monstrous sea waves to crush the ships of any who offend him (Figure 5-5). Like the restless element over which he rules, Poseidon is volatile, unpredictable, and quick to rage. Any sailor venturing into his realm must propitiate the god with acceptable sacrifices if he hopes to reach his destination safely. In the Odyssey, Poseidon represents the brutal power of nature against which the hero must pit his human intelligence in order to survive. Homer also suggests an important component of Poseidon’s character through his son Polyphemus, an uncouth Cyclops who devours his guests and refuses to observe any code of civilized behavior (see Chapter 12). Although master of the sea, Poseidon is also associated with land animals such as bulls and horses—images of masculine virility.

In this mosaic from the Villa Stabiae (Pompeii) depicting Poseidon—with his wife, Amphi- trite—driving a chariot trium- phantly over the waves, the sea god is surrounded by symbols of his marine domain, including the ships of fishermen who depend on his goodwill to survive. The tri- dent Poseidon holds in his left hand is the three-pronged instru- ment he uses to stir the sea to de- structive fury during storms. Note the nimbi, or halos, encircling the couple s heads, a symbol of di- vinity later borrowed by Christian artists. (Louvre, Paris) it is the effect of Poseidon, in the form of a colossal bull, bellowing and pawing the ground. As the invisible earthshaker, he was worshiped from Mycenaean times on as lord of earthquakes, a personification of seismic energy. As an embodiment of natural violence and the begetter of monstrous offspring, Poseidon is a particularly dangerous god. If offended, he is merciless even to his worshipers; when the Phaeacians, once favorites of the seas ruler, provide Odysseus with safe conduct back to Ithaca, he angrily turns their returning ship to stone and shatters their peace by convulsing the earth, elevating a mountain range to surround their city {Odyssey, Book 13). Not surprisingly, when mortals first began to settle in cities, many were reluctant to choose Poseidon as their presiding deity. The list of gods who successfully competed against Poseidon to become the divine patrons of cities throughout Greece is impressively long. In competition for Corinth, Poseidon lost to Helios (the Sun); for Aegina, to Zeus; for Troezen and Athens, to Athene; for Argos, to Hera; for Delphi, to Apollo; and for Naxos, to Dionysus. Although widely recognized as a natural force that must be placated, Poseidon’s surly temperament earned him a poor showing in mythic popularity contests.

An impor- tant aspect of the ancient Great God- dess, Demeter represents the fertility of earth’s soil and hence the grain har- vest on which the entire human com- munity depends for survival. In this monumental statue, the seated god- dess stares ahead unseeingly, blinded by grief for her daughter, Persephone, whom Zeus and Hades have secretly conspired to take from her. The myth of Demeter’s agonized search for the abducted girl—hidden deep in Ha- des’ underground realm —and Per- sephone’s role in nature’s annual cycle of death and regeneration represent one of the most important religious traditions of Greek civilization.

Although her principal myth—Hades’ abduction of Persephone (see Chapter 4)—emphasizes her maternal love for a single child, other tales illustrate additional aspects of the Demeter tradition. According to one episode introduced into the story of Demeter’s search for Persephone, Poseidon attempted to seduce his grieving sister. When Demeter tried to escape his unwelcome attentions by transforming herself into a mare, the sea god nonetheless completed his rape, fathering a horse called Arion and a mysterious daughter, named “the Mistress.” lasion, the son of Zeus and Electra, a daughter of the Titan Atlas, fell passionately in love with Demeter. One version of the myth suggests that she did not return his affection and that lasion, in retaliation, tried to harm her, for which Zeus killed him with a thunderbolt. According to Hesiod’s Theogony, Demeter reciprocated lasion’s love and lay with the hero in a thrice-plowed field, their union resulting in a son. Plums. In this chthonic (earth-related) myth, lasion is the male consort of a fertility goddess to whom Demeter gives seeds of wheat, making him an adjunct of her func- tion as the producer of grain. Greek art typically pictures their son Plutus [PLOO- tuhs], a personification of wealth, as a young man carrying a horn of plenty. Hades (Pluto, Dis) Even gloomier than the irascible Poseidon, Hades [HAY-deez] is “Zeus of the Un- derworld,” a chthonic figure who represents the darker, more sinister aspects of di- vinity, a polar opposite of Zeus’s sunlit vitality.

Wearing a cap of invisibility, Hades may be present without being seen. For the ancient Greeks, the invisible god was virtually ubiquitous; one could not know when, figuratively. Hades’ subterranean realm would suddenly open, drawing the living into a chasm of perpetual darkness. Hades rarely appears in the upper world and figures prominently in only one major myth, the story of Persephone’s abduction (see the Homeric Hymn to Demeter in Chapter 4). Also called Pluto [PLOO-toh] {Plouton, the “wealth-giver”) because gems and mineral riches are found under the earth. Hades has a grim and pitiless personality, his implacability reflecting the harsh natural law that condemns all living things to death. (Hades’ subterranean kingdom, which played a major role in the Greek imagination, is described in Chapter 9.) Hestia (Vesta) Zeus’s unmarried sister Hestia [HES-tee-uh] is the only Olympian for whom no myths were created. An immortal virgin devoted exclusively to guarding the Olym- pian hearth and its life-sustaining fire, she represents the unmoving, fixed center of family life, both human and divine. A symbol of unchanging permanence, she never leaves her assigned place and hence neither acts nor becomes involved in others’ ac- tions, a role that precludes her having any life story of her own. In Greek myth, her opposite is Hermes, who roams freely throughout the universe, an embodiment of divine force and movement. Hestia’s colorless passivity, though essential to her iden- tification with the domestic hearth, ultimately resulted in her being demoted from Olympus, to be replaced by the energetic Dionysus. In Roman myth, Hestia was known as Vesta [VES-tuh] and figured more promi- nently in the civic cult as keeper of the sacred flame that symbolized Rome’s essential life force. The Vestal Virgins, famous for remaining strictly celibate while performing their holy duties, were well-born women who maintained Vesta’s eternal flame in a temple near the Roman forum. Tradition decreed that any Vestal priestess who broke her oath of celibacy was to be buried alive. Released from their vows only at their fortieth birthday, the Vestals’ peculiar circumstance gave birth to the adage that “life begins at forty.” The Younger Olympians Zeus is the only Olympian deity whose children are major gods in their own right. Of the seven younger Olympians, only two are Hera’s. Athene (Minerva) Like her half-brothers Hermes and Apollo, Athene is a complex deity whose many attributes and functions encompass contradictory elements. Although born without a mother, she takes a keen interest in women’s activities, particularly the domestic arts of spinning and weaving. Athene is also the patron of pottery making and other crafts; with Hephaestus, god of smiths and metalworkers, she shares the patronage of virtually all civilized, productive skills.

Athenian myth consistently identified the goddess with their city’s welfare. (Acropolis Museum, Athens) which bears her name, Athene has a particularly warm relationship with its citizens. At the beginning of Athens’s history, she successfully competed against her uncle Poseidon for the city’s allegiance. To win the contest, Poseidon offered Athens’s citi- zens the dubious gift of a saltwater spring; the practical Athene easily demonstrated her greater usefulness as a divine patron by donating the domestic olive tree, whose fruit and oil became one of Athens’s chief exports. These beneficent qualities, however, are only part of Athene’s character. When she sprang from Zeus’s head, she appeared fully armed with a warrior’s helmet, shield, and spear. Although not a deity of war as such, she is a powerful fighter and defender of the Greek city-state (Figure 5-7). In crucial battles during the Persian invasion of Greece, she was said to have been invisibly present supporting the Greek side, inspir- ing Athenian soldiers to otherwise impossible acts of courage and valor. Protector of civilized values, especially order and justice, Athene typically wins battles through forethought and strategy, cleverly outmaneuvering enemies.

(ArcheologicalMuseum, Naples) aroused, Athene can be pitiless: her hostility toward Paris and his fellow Trojans is unrelenting (see Chapter 11); and she refuses to spare from death a single man among Penelopes one hundred unwanted suitors (see Chapter 12). Implacable toward those who offend her, Athene cruelly punishes Arachne, a young woman who foolishly challenges Athene to a contest of v/eaving skills, chang- ing the impertinent mortal into a spider. In Sophocles’ play Ajax, she is positively fiendish, driving into madness a noble warrior who tries to win Achilles’ armor from her favorite, Odysseus. By contrast, Athene graciously befriends selected heroes, such as Odysseus and Heracles, who mirror her attributes of intelligence and resourceful- ness. Devoted to the Athenians, she helps to establish their first law courts, encour- aging a democratic jury system that tempers justice with mercy (see the Eumenides 'm Chapter 15). In peace, she promotes the political art of persuasion, urging her people to cooperate for the common good. Embodying the kind of pragmatic wisdom involved in clever planning and win- ning strategies, Athene is typically self-disciplined, even austere. Two myths, however, present the armor-clad virgin in surprisingly erotic situations. On one occasion, a burst of vanity embroils her in a beauty competition with Hera and Aphrodite; her bitter resentment at losing to the love goddess helps to seal Troy’s doom, for the goddess of victory in war supports the Greek side. In a tradition about Athens’s ori-"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"The Olympian Family of Zeus 149 gins, myth is even equal to the task of creating a tale in which Athene can remain perpetually virginal yet, in a sense, indirectly become the mother of one of the city’s earliest rulers. While visiting Hephaestus’s forge to order new weapons, Athene un- expectedly finds herself fending off the lame god’s passionate advances. During the struggle, Hephaestus ejaculates on Athene’s thigh. Perhaps because Hephaestus’s at- tempted rape is both clumsy and unsuccessful, Athene behaves with remarkable cool- ness: she neither recriminates nor plots revenge. Instead, she calmly takes a wool cloth, wipes the semen from her thigh, and tosses the wet rag out of heaven. Because a god’s seed always bears fruit, when the enseminated wool falls on mother earth, a child, Ericthonius, is born. Accepting responsibility for the baby, Athene places Ericthonius in a basket and entrusts him to the daughters of Cecrops, the mythical first king of Athens. Against Athene’s instructions, the young women look into the basket and are driven insane by the sight: either Ericthonius has the lower body of a serpent, a characteristic of earth’s offspring, or he is guarded by frightening snakes. Athene then takes Ericthonius to her sacred precincts atop the Athenian Acropolis, where he grows up to become Athens’s king. Under Athene’s guidance, Ericthonius is said to have invented the first four-horse chariot and established the Panathenaea [pan-ath-e-NEE-a], the annual festival held in the goddess’s honor. Other myths ascribe these accomplishments to Erechtheus [e-REK-thee-uhs], an- other prehistoric ruler who is variously identified as the son or grandson of Erich- thonius. The Erechtheum, a small temple famous for its porch roof supported by statues of young maidens, still stands on the Athenian Acropolis. Apollo The sole Olympian whose name remains the same in Roman myth, Apollo (Apollon) is the son of Zeus and Leto, daughter of the Titans Coeus and Phoebe. A god of multiple functions, he is primarily the giver of rational harmony—both mental and physical—and a seer of future events. As communicator of the gods’ will to hu- manity, he establishes his main sanctuary at Delphi on Mount Parnassus, where his virgin priestess—known as the Pythia or Pythoness —issues cryptic pronouncements whose ambiguities are described as “oracular.” The Delphic Oracle became the most respected and widely consulted institution of prophecy in the Greco-Roman world (see Chapter 7). Often cited as the most typically Gteek of all gods, Apollo is called Phoebus— the radiant, or shining, one, an embodiment of intellectual and spiritual enlighten- ment. In late myths, he assumes the duties of Hyperion (or Helios) and is identified with the sun. Apollo shares with his half-brother Hermes the patronage of rustic shepherds, flocks, and fields, but he is preeminently a symbol of sophisticated cre- ativity, as indicated by his role as protector of the Muses. The lyre (a small stringed instrument used to accompany poets’ songs) represents his artistic function. Embodying a typically Greek paradox, Apollo is the great Archer King whose arrows can inflict sickness, decimating whole armies or cities with plague, but he is also the bestower of the healing arts through his son Asclepius [as-CLEE-pee-uhs], the first physician. Apollo’s characteristic use of the arrow as his chosen weapon well expresses the god’s cool detachment. Unlike Ares or even Athene, he does not wield a sword at close quarters, but chooses instead to work his effects at a great distance (Figure 5-9)."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"150 The Mythic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes FIGURE 5-9 Apollo.

Aloof and detached, Apollo is nonetheless Zeus’s chosen channel of prophecy, the giver of divine oracles that reveal the gods’ will to humanity. (Olympia Museum)"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"The Olympian Family of Zeus 151 A model of civilized self-discipline, Apollo is nonetheless capable of savage cruelty, as when he flays alive Marsyas, who claimed that he could play the flute more beau- tifully than the god. A satyr—an embodiment of carnality—Marsyas is Apollo’s op- posite, unthinking instinct stripped away by the keen edge of intellect. (For a more complete discussion of Apollo’s myth, including his typically unhappy love affairs, see Chapter 7.) Artemis (Diana) Artemis [AR-te-mis], Apollo’s twin sister, was born first and immediately acted as midwife for the birth of her younger sibling. Although patron of midwifery and childbirth, a function she shares with Hera and Eileithyia, Artemis is a virgin who jealously guards her privacy. When the hunter Actaeon observes her bathing, she changes him into a stag that is immediately torn to pieces by his own dogs. Like her twin brother, Artemis embodies contradictory functions: she is both protector of wild animals and patron of the hunt dedicated to their slaughter. She also resembles Apollo by carrying a quiver of arrows, with which she can inflict the pains of childbirth—or even cause death. A famous vase painting shows Apollo and Artemis shooting down the children of Niobe, who naively boasts that she is Leto’s superior because she has so many more sons and daughters (Figure 5-10). Guardian of women’s groups, such as the Amazons, Artemis is frequently identified with the moon, an astronomical symbol of the feminine psyche. Myth’s most celebrated linking of Artemis with sexual abstinence involves not a virgin companion of the goddess but a male worshiper, Hippolytus, son of Theseus [THEE-see-uhs], an early king of Athens. In Euripides’ play the Hippolytus, the title hero, exclusively devoted to Artemis and the hunt, denounces Aphrodite as no better than a prostitute, angering the love goddess, who then plots his destruction. Artemis, whom the chaste Hippolytus has adored, does nothing to rescue him from a fellow goddess whom he has insulted. In the Homeric epics, Artemis plays a relatively small role, supporting her brother Apollo’s defense of the Trojans but appearing on the battlefield only once {Iliad, Book 21). When the Olympians line up to fight for either Greeks or Trojans, Artemis first berates her twin for refusing to tackle Poseidon and is then attacked by Hera, who knocks Artemis’s bow and arrows to the ground with one hand while she repeatedly slaps the huntress’s face with the other. Humiliated, Artemis flees for consolation to Zeus, who merely chuckles at the behavior of the women in his family. Artemis’s emotional detachment, and even cruelty, appears in numerous myths. When mortal women die suddenly or unexpectedly, Artemis commonly is seen as the cause. Not only does she gladly join her brother in killing the children of Niobe, but, according to some myths, she also demands the death of Agamemnon’s daughter Iphigenia, although other accounts state that she prevented the human sacrifice by substituting a stag for the girl (see the “Orestes and Iphigenia” box in Chapter 15). Greek colonists of Asia Minor associated Artemis with older fertility goddesses of the Near East, depicting her as either multibreasted or covered with fruitlike symbols of fecundity (see Figure 4-2). The largest Greco-Roman temple, one of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world, was erected to Artemis at Ephesus. (For a discussion of Artemis’s crucial role in Greek girls’ rite of passage to adulthood, see Chapter 10.)"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"152 The Mythic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes FIGURE 5-10 Artemis and Apollo. In this vase painting, the twins Artemis and Apollo aim their lethal arrows at the children of Niobe. A daughter of Tantalus who has fourteen children (the number varies in different traditions), Niobe boasts that she is superior to Leto, who has only two children. At Leto’s request to avenge her honor, Apollo and Artemis then slay all but two of Niobe’s sons and daughters. Consumed with grief, Niobe dissolves in tears, becoming a rock from which a spring flows. (Louvre, Paris) Hermes (Mercury) Hermes [HER-meez], the son of Zeus and Maia, a daughter of the Titan Atlas, has even more attributes and spheres of influence than Apollo, but his primary function is to serve as Zeus’s personal messenger, traveling swiftly over vast distances of land and sea to carry out his father’s orders. As the Olympian who represents the opposite of Hestia’s intractable fixity, Hermes represents mobility and the benefits that derive from it. The essence of physical movement, transitions, and communication, he is the patron of those who prosper through travel, trade, or theft.

In contrast to Praxiteles’ elegant statue of Hermes (see Figure 5-12), this rustic Herm is a simple square column topped with a bearded head and an erect phallus carved in front. Similar Hermae were placed at street corners, gateways, and entrances of private houses and along country roads, where they elicited reverence from and offered divine protection to travelers. (The erect phallus promised fertility and good luck to passersby.) (National Museum, Athens) gates, and doorways, wherever barter or other business was conducted or where jour- neys began or ended. Particularly in Athens, Hermes was depicted in the form of a quadrangular pillar crowned with the head of a bearded man and sporting an erect phallus (Figure 5-11). From about the sixth century B.C. on, these ithyphallic fig- ures, the Hermae, served to guarantee the success of all kinds of undertakings, both respectable and otherwise. Besides delivering Zeus’s orders throughout the cosmos and thereby supporting the divine order, Hermes was also the patron of all who lived by movement and mental agility, including merchants, gamblers, highwaymen, and thieves. Emphasizing his multiple functions, including his extreme mobility, Greek vase painters typically portray Hermes wearing winged sandals and a broad-brimmed traveler’s hat. He is also shown holding the caduceus, a wand entwined by two ser- pents and topped by a pair of wings, emblematic of Hermes’ authority as Zeus’s personal messenger and herald.

Allen Mandelbaum At one time, it was believed that Hermes evolved from an association with bound- ary markers—cairns or heaps of stone delimiting property lines. His name, however, appears in Linear B texts found on Crete and at such mainland sites as Pylos and Thebes, demonstrating that he was already an acknowledged deity in Mycenaean times. Hermes’ mythic origin and early childhood are narrated in a Homeric hymn that traces the god’s singularly amoral qualities to actions performed in his infancy."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"The Olympian Family of Zeus 155 According to this source (probably from the late sixth century B.C.), the newly born Hermes first lived with his mother Maia in a dank cave far from Olympus, an unde- sirable neighborhood that the ambitious babe soon resolves to quit. Gifted with as- tonishing precocity and a phenomenal ability to deceive, Hermes devises a plan that will inevitably compel Zeus to notice him and effect a permanent change of residence from the rude cave to the celestial glories of Mount Olympus. Born in the morning, by mid-day Hermes has invented a new musical instrument—the seven-stringed lyre—which he fashions out of a tortoise shell; by evening, he has stolen and hidden fifty head of Apollo’s cattle, bringing the angry son of Leto to his cave in search of his lost property. When the devious Hermes denies knowledge of the theft, Apollo hauls the young rogue to Olympus, where Zeus, amused at the child’s audacity—Hermes lies to Zeus himself—commands that the cattle be returned. Exploiting Apollo’s close identification with the Muses—and hence his passion for music—Hermes enraptures his older half-brother by playing the lyre, an instru- ment that produces more beautiful sounds than even the gods have previously heard. In exchange for permission to keep the stolen herd, Hermes gives Apollo the lyre, which thereafter becomes the god’s chief symbol. Hermes also invents a reed pipe, the syrinx or panpipes, which Apollo similarly appropriates, trading the caduceus for it. The hymn concludes with Apollo not only pacified by Hermes’ clever bargaining but henceforth also bound to him in a pact of eternal friendship. Only two days old, Hermes has succeeded in assuaging Apollo’s wrath, learning from his erstwhile victim the art of divination, and convincing Zeus that his ingenious son belongs among the immortal company on Olympus. Although the Homeric Hymn to Hermes touches on many of Hermes’ attributes, it only alludes briefly to his important role as Psychopompos, the guide who escorts souls of the recently dead to their final rest in Hades’ cheerless abode. Effortlessly transiting vast distances from heaven to earth to the Underworld, Hermes’ itinerary connects all levels of the cosmos—from the throne of Zeus, where he hears the divine will, to the murky nether regions where he delivers souls to Charon, the dread boatman who transports the dead across the River Styx (see Chapter 9). Associated not only with unknown paths to Hades’ mysterious realm but also with sleep, dreams, magic, and fortune-telling, Hermes was sometimes perceived as a doorway to mysticism and occult knowledge. By the fourth century A.D., when Greco-Roman society was crumbling, Hermes became identified with the Egyptian Thoth, a god of arcane wisdom, and was known as Hermes Trismegistus (Thrice- Greatest). Except for the story of his infancy, Hermes is ordinarily featured as a subordinate figure in most extant myths, serving as Zeus’s go-between. His diplomatic skills are featured in the Iliad, where he negotiates King Priam’s recovery of his son’s corpse from the fierce Achilles; in the Odyssey, he intervenes to give Odysseus a charm that will protect the hero from Circe’s sorcery and, later, to persuade the possessive Ca- lypso that she must release Odysseus from his captivity on her remote island (see Chapter 12). His appearance as a blustering bully in Prometheus Botmd, where he represents a tyrannical Zeus, seems out of character for this divine maker of mischief. Unlike the other male Olympians, Hermes is not associated with killing or vio- lence; his only murder is that of Argus, the hundred-eyed monster that Hera used to spy on Zeus, a deed that earns him the epithet of “giant-slayer.” Although generally"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"156 The Myth ic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes well disposed toward humans, he remains—like the Norse god Loki—an incorri- gible trickster, the bane of any unwary victim who crosses his path. As his mother Maia correctly observed, he is destined to be a “great nuisance to mortal men and the undying gods!” Hephaestus (Vulcan) The tradition that Hephaestus is entirely Hera’s creation (although other tales make Zeus the father) indicates the close bond between mother and son. As she is the up- holder of domesticity, Hephaestus is the house builder, the supremely gifted crafts- man who single-handedly erects the gods’ palatial dwelling on Olympus. God of fire and the forge, he manufactures Zeus’s thunderbolts, fashions golden armor for Achil- les, assists at Athene’s birth, and creates the first woman. Pandora, from clay (see Chapter 6). The marriage of the sooty, clumsy, lame god of the workshop with the elegantly beautiful Aphrodite is a classic example of marital mismatching that inevitably leads to infidelity. Homer states that, when Hephaestus discovers his wife’s adultery with Ares, he devises an invisible net to trap the guilty pair together in bed. Instead of offering sympathy to the wronged husband, Apollo and Hermes confess that they would be glad to exchange positions with Ares, provoking gales of “Olympian laughter.” Despite Hephaestus’s marginality as the only imperfect Olympian, his skills as blacksmith, valued by the many artisans in Greek society, were celebrated in cults throughout Greece. On Lemnos, where he landed when thrown down from Olym- pus, Hephaestus had a sanctuary at which rituals honoring the god were performed. In Athens, a popular cult linked him with Athene, the patron of weavers, spinners, and potters; between them the two gods presided over virtually every manual art and craft. Every fifth year, a festival called the Hephaestia was held in honor of Athene and Hephaestus, which featured a torch race and elaborate sacrifices. The myth of Hephaestus’s abortive attempt to rape Athene, which produced the earth-born Erich- thonius, the supposed ancestor of the Athenians, suggests the centrality of this un- likely couple in Athenian life. Because the northeastern Mediterranean is located in a geologically active region, with frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, the fire god had a special promi- nence. Some myths indicate that Hephaestus built his blacksmith shop under Mount Etna in Sicily (the same volcano under which, according to other traditions, the monster Typhoeus was imprisoned). In Roman myth, Hephaestus was identified with the god Vulcan (Vulcanus), whose forge was said to be located under the Medi- terranean island of Vulcano, from which the modern term volcano derives. Aphrodite (Venus) A personification of human sexual desire. Aphrodite is the Greek counterpart of the ancient Near Eastern goddess of love and fertility known to the Sumerians as Inanna and to the Babylonians as Ishtar. The most important female deity in Mesopotamia, Inanna/Ishtar—the “Lady of Heaven”—appears prominently in the Gilgamesh epic."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"The Olympian Family of Zeus 157 in which the hero refuses to mate with her because of her reputation for depriving her male lovers of their humanity, transforming them into snakes or moles before abandoning them altogether. A goddess of war as well as physical love, Ishtar made the battlefield her “playground,” fighting invisibly alongside the kings she favored. Ishtar’s violent and sinister qualities are mirrored in her sister Ereshkigal, ruler of the Mesopotamian Underworld. When Hesiod links Aphrodite’s birth to the violent castration of Uranus, he ech- oes older Near Eastern aspects of the love goddess. (In some Mesopotamian myths, Ishtar is the daughter of Anu, who, like Uranus, embodies the sky.) Whereas Hesiod’s Aphrodite is a primordial force who rises from the sea, Homer portrays her more conventionally as the daughter of Zeus and Dione, a daughter of either Uranus and Gaea or the Titans Oceanus and Tethys. In Hesiod’s version of her origin. Aphrodite is a mighty goddess who precedes the Olympians in both time and importance: ac- companied by Eros (Love), she is responsible for the irresistible attractions that propagate life throughout the cosmos. In Homer, she is reduced to being another of Zeus’s many children, a “laughter-loving” lightweight who arranges for the adultery of Paris and Helen and who, though married to Hephaestus, carries on an extramari- tal affair with Ares. (“The Loves of Ares and Aphrodite,” from Book 8 of the Odyssey, is included in this chapter; see also Chapter 4). According to some sources. Aphrodite bears Ares three children: Harmonia, Phobos, and Deimos. The daughter, Harmonia, marries Cadmus, founder of Thebes (see Chapter 13); the sons are personifications of emotions associated with war: Deimos (Fear) and Phobos (Panic), who accompany their father into battle. The Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite, which narrates her seduction of Anchises, the Trojan shepherd-prince, and the birth of their son Aeneas, illustrates Aphrodite’s will- ingness to take even a mortal man to bed. The tradition that Anchises suffered pre- mature aging when he unwisely boasted of his liaison with a goddess seems consistent with Gilgamesh’s charge that Ishtar routinely deprived her human lovers of their virility; sexual contact with a divinity invariably exacts a formidable toll. The myth of Aeneas’s divine parentage later played an influential role in Roman culture, prompting the early emperors to claim descent from Aeneas, a mythic legacy that Virgil employs in the Aeneid (see Chapter 19). Greco-Roman myth also offers several examples of the miserable fate awaiting persons who presume to live without experiencing the sexual love that Aphrodite represents. In Euripides’ tragedy, Hippolytus learns too late the dire consequences of scorning Aphrodite; in Ovid’s tale of Narcissus, the self-absorbed youth refuses love from both women and young men, an affront to the intrinsic nature of the universe (see Chapter 20). Eros (Cupid) Either one of the oldest gods (Hesiod) or Aphrodite’s son by Ares (Homer), Eros is a masculine aspect of the love goddess who projects arrows of fierce desire into the hearts of both gods and mortals (Figure 5-13). Although not one of the official twelve Olympians, he flits about Olympus as familiarly as he does on earth. The Greeks regarded Eros as an adolescent youth, but the Romans pictured him as a chubby infant (Cupid) and identified his mother as Venus, a goddess of gardens and flowers."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"158 The Mythic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes FIGURE 5-13 Aphrodite and Ares, v^lthough married to Hephaestus, god of the forge, Aphrodite takes Ares as her favored lover. In this wall painting from Pompeii, the artist celebrates the union of the gods of love and war, illustrating the affinity between sexual desire and martial aggressiveness. Eros, the winged boy appearing on the upper left, is in some myths the son of Ares and Aphro- dite, explaining the mixture of calculating detachment and passionate assertive- ness in his character.

Although Ares exists only to fight and kill (or to commit adultery with Aphrodite), he is not the most effective Olympian warrior: when the gods descend to a Trojan battlefield, Athene has little trouble vanquishing the war god by hurling a boulder at him {Iliad, Book 21).

(See Chapter 13 for Dionysus’s patronage of tragedy and comedy.) When the latecomer Dionysus was added to the Olympian pantheon, the mytho- logically undeveloped Hestia was demoted to make room for him, thus keeping the traditional number of Olympians at twelve. Whereas the Olympians hold sway over the universe at large, a host of minor deities preside over geographically limited areas, specific activities, or particular landforms: lovely naiads (female nature spirits) inhabit springs, rivers, and lakes; dryads are the indwelling spirits of trees; and oreads live in mountainous terrain. Pan, who has a human torso and arms but the legs, ears, and horns of a goat, is a personification of all natural wild things (Figure 5-15). His name, derived from the root pa(s), means “guardian of flocks,” designating his function as the god responsible for the fertility of shepherds and flocks. Like nature itself.

A brilliant mosaic of nobility, splendor, and amoral passion, the Greek gods mir- ror the values and contrarieties of the patriarchal society that created them. Although a few Greek thinkers, such as Plato, dismissed some myths about the Olympians as ethically irresponsible (see Chapter 2), most Greek and Roman writers delighted in elaborating on the psychological affinity that linked humans to their gods. Picturing a class of beings who achieve virtually every human wish, myth simultaneously em- phasizes the mysterious but painfully real gulf of mortality that forever separates the human world from the divine."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"The Olympian Family of Zeus 161 The Gods at Home Whereas the majority of Greek myths focus on the earthly adventures of mortal he- roes— the gods appearing only intermittently to influence the action—the Homeric epics feature several scenes depicting the gods alone in the privacy of their Olympian retreat. Early in both the Iliad and the Odyssey, the gods hold heavenly councils at which they discuss such weighty matters as cosmic justice or the fate of outstanding heroes such as Achilles or Odysseus {Iliad, Book 1; Odyssey, Book 1). In an episode dramatizing “The Loves of Ares and Aphrodite,” however, Homer offers a rare glimpse of the gods’ behavior when they are not engaged in the serious business of administering the universe. This self-contained narrative from the Odyssey, presented as the song of a court minstrel named Demodocus, portrays the gods of love and war pursuing recreational sex, much as if they were aristocratic inhabitants of one of the ancient Minoan or Mycenaean palace complexes, where one noble might gain easy access to the wife of an absent peer (see Color Plate 11). Demodocus’s celebration of this adulterous affair—and the outraged Hephaestus’s ingenious trap for his unfaithful wife and her ill-tempered lover—is remarkably light-hearted. When Hephaestus summons the other male deities (the goddesses stay away out of modesty) to witness the adulterers entangled in his invisible web (see Color Plate 14), the wronged husband receives no comfort or encouragement from his fellow gods. Apollo and Hermes only wish aloud that they could exchange places with Ares—a pleasure for which they would gladly bear public exposure and humilia- tion.

And yet the chain that bagged them holds them down till Father sends me back my wedding gifts— all that I poured out for his damned pigeon, so lovely, and so wanton.” All the others were crowding in, now, to the brazen house— Poseidon who embraces earth, and Hermes the runner, and Apollo, lord of Distance. The goddesses stayed home for shame; but these munificences ranged there in the doorway, and irrepressible among them all arose the laughter of the happy gods. Gazing hard at Hephaistos’ handiwork the gods in turn remarked among themselves: “No dash in adultery now.” “The tortoise tags the hare— Hephaistos catches Ares — and Ares outran the wind.” “The lame god’s craft has pinned him. Now shall he pay what is due from gods taken in cuckoldry.” They made these improving remarks to one another, but Apollo leaned aside to say to Hermes: “Son of Zeus, beneficent Wayfinder, would you accept a coverlet of chain, if only 40 50 60 70"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"164 HOMER you lay by Aphrodite’s golden side?” To this the Wayfinder replied, shining: “Would I not, though, Apollo of distances! 80 Wrap me in chains three times the weight of these, come goddesses and gods to see the fun; only let me lie beside the pale-golden one!” The gods gave way again to peals of laughter, all but Poseidon, and he never smiled, but urged Hephaistos to unpinion Ares, saying emphatically, in a loud voice: “Free him; you will be paid, I swear; ask what you will; he pays up every jot the gods decree.” To this the Great Gamelegs replied: “Poseidon, 90 lord of the earth-surrounding sea, I should not swear to a scoundrel’s honor. What have I as surety from you, if Ares leaves me empty-handed, with my empty chain?” The Earth-shaker for answer urged again: “Fiephaistos, let us grant he goes, and leaves the fine unpaid; I swear, then, I shall pay it.” Then said the Great Gamelegs at last: “No more; you offer terms I cannot well refuse.” And down the strong god bent to set them free, lOO till disencumbered of their bond, the chain, the lovers leapt away—he into Thrace, while Aphrodite, laughter’s darling, fled to Kypros Isle and Paphos, to her meadow and altar dim with incense. There the Graces bathed and anointed her with golden oil— a bloom that climbs upon immortal flesh alone— and let her folds of mantle fall in glory.

The poet’s tale of Hermes’ youthful lies, deceit, thievery, and successful manipula- tion of other gods, including his father Zeus, highlights the Olympians’ remarkable tolerance for deviant behavior among family members—provided it is done with the boldness, impish charm, and effectiveness with which Hermes accomplishes his mischief (see the section on Hermes).] Sing, Muse, of Hermes, the son of Zeus and Maia, i Guardian over Cyllene and sheep-rich Arcadia, Luck-bringing messenger of the immortals, whom Maia, Shy, lovely-haired nymph, brought forth of her union in love With Zeus. Shunning the company of the blessed immortals. She lived in a shadowy cave, where Zeus son of Cronos Came often by night to lie with the lovely-haired nymph In the deep silent hours when sweet sleep possessed white-armed Hera, Escaping thereby the observance of undying gods and of men. But when the purpose of powerful Zeus was accomplished lO And the tenth moon of Maia hung high in heaven. She brought forth into the light, and his ruse was revealed. The son she bore then was a versatile child, wily and wheedling, A thief and a drover of cattle, a marshal of dreams. By night a spy on watch at the gates, destined forthwith To make manifest glorious deeds among the immortals. Born in the morning, at midday he played on the lyre. And at eventide stole the cows of far-shooting Apollo, On the fourth day of the month—the day Maia bore him. After he leapt from the immortal loins of his mother, 20 He tarried no longer to lie asleep in his holy cradle. But rose up at once to go in search of the cows of Apollo. He clambered over the sill of the high-vaulted cavern. Where to his endless delight he discovered a tortoise— Hermes it was who first made the tortoise a singer— Coming upon it by chance at the gate of the courtyard As, awkwardly mincing along on hesitant feet. It browsed on the lush green grass in front of the dwelling. Zeus’ child, the luck-bringer, looked closely and laughed, and straightway spoke a word: “A most useful token for me already! Not I one to scorn it! 30 Hail, lovely creature, stamping the ground in the dance. * Translation by Thelma Sargent."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"166 HOMERIC HYMN TO HERMES Comrade of the feast! Welcome indeed is your coming! Where did you get that handsome bauble you wear, O tortoise, You who live in the mountains — that patterned shell? But let me carry you into the house. You will be useful To me; I will show you no lack of honor, but first you must serve me. Inside the house is better; out of doors there is danger. Alive you will be a shield against baneful enchantment. But if you should die, then would you sing with great beauty.” So Hermes spoke and, picking the creature up with both hands. Went back into the house with his lovely new plaything. There with a knife of gray iron he cut off the legs And bored out the life of the mountain-bred tortoise. As a swift thought courses through the heart of a man Who writhes under close-crowding troubles, or as sparks flash from his eyes. So at the same moment did glorious Hermes merge plan and deed. He fixed at measured intervals cut stalks of reed Through the clean-scooped shell of the tortoise and spanning the back. And, by a stroke of wisdom, stretched oxhide over the hollow. He added two horns to the sides yoked by a crossbar. From which he stretched taut seven strings made of sheepgut. When it was finished, he lifted the lovely toy on his arm And tried each string in turn with the plectrum, and under his hand A strange new sound rang out, and the god, trying his skill. Sang along in sweet random snatches, as at festivals Boys in the springtime of youth maliciously carol— Singing of Zeus son of Cronos and Maia, beautifully sandaled. And of their former intimate love and communion. Recounting the tale of his own famous birth and begetting. He honored as well the handmaids of the nymph and her glorious halls And the tripods throughout her household and caldrons galore. While yet Hermes sang, he yearned in his heart for new things. He carried the hollow lyre to his holy wickerwork cradle And there laid it down; then, craving the taste of flesh. Forth from the sweet-scented chamber he sallied, and sprang to a lookout. His mind turning over devices of deepest deception. Deeds such as robbers arrange in the time of black night. Helios was driving his chariot and horses from earth Downward toward Ocean when Hermes arrived all in haste In Pieria s shadowy mountains, there where the heavenly cattle Of the blessed immortal gods had their stables and, sheltered. Placidly grazed the lovely meadows unmown and fragrant. The son of Maia, far-sighted slayer of Argos, Cut out from the sacred herd fifty loud-bellowing beasts. And drove them by random ways through the sandy places. Turning their hoofprints aside; then he chanced on the crafty conceit Of reversing their hoofs, so that their forefeet came after. Their hind feet before, and he himself walked behind them.

He tied up in a bundle an armful of new-sprouted wood. Leaves and all, and bound as light sandals securely under his feet The bundles of boughs he gathered, the glorious slayer of Argos, Preparing thus for his journey home from Pieria As one hard-pressed prepares for a wearisome road. But an old man tending his flowering vineyard saw him As he hurried down to the plain through grassy Onchestos. The son of glorious Maia spoke first and addressed him: “Old fellow, you who among your vines dig with bent shoulders, 90 Rich in wine will you be when all these vines bear If you heed me and remember well in your heart. Seeing, not to have seen, and, having heard, to be mute. Be silent except when some harm has been done to your own.” So much he said, then drove on with his herd of strong cattle. On through countless shadowy mountains and rushing ravines And flowery plains did glorious Hermes drive them. Until divine night, his dark ally, had for the greater part Covered her course, and dawn that calls man to work was fast breaking. And shining Selene, daughter of royal lord Pallas, lOO Son fathered by Megamedes, had newly ascended her watchtower. Down then to the river Alpheus Hermes, stout son of Zeus, Drove the broad-fronted cattle of Phoebus Apollo. Unwearied, at length they came to the high-vaulted byre And the watering troughs before the magnificent meadow. When Hermes had seen the loud-lowing cattle well sated with fodder. He rounded them up and herded them into their stable. Still munching on lotus and galingale sprinkled with dew. Then the god gathered wood in abundance, and sought after the technique of fire. Grasping a branch of bright laurel, he peeled olL the bark with his knife, i lO Held close in the palm of his hand, and the hot blast burst forth. Hermes thus first of all gave man fire and the kindling of fire. Then he stacked thick in a pit dug in the ground Dry, seasoned logs without stint, and the flame grew and brightened. Sending far distant the blaze of hot-burning fire. While the power of glorious Hephaistos was feeding the flame, Hermes, endowed with great strength, dragged out of the stable To a spot near the fire two lowing, crumple-horned beasts. And threw them, both panting, down on their backs on the ground. And, rolling them over, forced back their heads and bored out their lives. 120 Deed he added to deed. He cut up the meat rich with fat. And, piercing the morsels with wooden spits, roasted the flesh. Along with the chine highly honored and the black blood Confined in the entrails, and these he laid on the ground. The hides he stretched on a steep slab of rough unhewn rock. And so they remain even now, long ages since they were placed there—"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"168 HOMERIC HYMN TO HERMES Ages long past these events, and forever unchanging. Next, joyous-hearted, Hermes hauled the rich meat To a smooth, flat stone and divided it into twelve portions. Sharing it out by lot, and conferring to each his due measure of honor. 130 Then, tempted, glorious Hermes yearned for a taste of the meat Unreserved to the gods, for the pleasant odor of roasting Distressed even him, an immortal, but his strong heart was steadfast; No morsel slid down his holy throat however great was his yearning. Instead, he carried inside the high-vaulted byre The fat and a mound of roast flesh and, hoisting them quickly aloft. There laid them up in remembrance of his youthful theft. Then, gathering dry sticks together, he covered his traces. Destroying all the feet and the thickly curled heads Of the two slain beasts in the hot blaze of the fire. 140 When all his work at last was completed, the god Tossed his tamarisk sandals deep into the eddying Alpheus And put out the embers and strewed over with sand the black ashes. All through the night he labored, while the lovely light of Selene shone down. Then at dawn scurried back to the shining peaks of Cyllene; Nor did anyone either of blessed gods or of mortals Encounter him on the long journey, or any dog bark. Then luck-bringing Hermes, begotten by Zeus, turning sideways. Made his way into the hall of his home through the keyhole Like a breeze in autumn, or incorporeal mist. 150 He slipped straight through the cave to the rich inner chamber. His silent feet making no sound as they might on the ground. Climbing quickly back into his wickerwork cradle, glorious Hermes Drew around him his swaddling wraps, enfolding his shoulders. Seeming an infant newborn and helpless, and, as he lay. Played with his hands at the coverings over his knees While under his left arm he sheltered his lovely tortoise. But the god eluded not the eye of the goddess his mother. “Where do you come sneaking home from, you rascal,” she said, “at this time of night. You of consummate wiles, clad in shamelessness? Very soon now, 160 I foresee, you will quickly be helplessly bound with strong bands Close round the ribs by the hand of Leto’s Apollo, And carried bodily out the front door—not playing your tricks Down in the glens and the hollows robbing betweentimes. Back with you again where you came from! Your father begot you To be a great nuisance to mortal men and the undying gods!” Hermes then answered her, craftily choosing his words: “Mother mine, why do you welcome me with these threats and forebodings. Like an innocent child who knows very little of evil, A baby who shrinks with fright when his mother reproves him? 170 Me, I shall hit upon some clever scheme—what may be best— And so provide food for you and for me for all time.

As to honor, I too will enter into the rites Apollo enjoys. But if my father withholds the gift, then indeed I will try— And doubt not that I can—to become the prince among robbers. 180 And if the son of all-glorious Leto searches me out. Something else even worse, I predict, will befall him. For I will go and break into his great house at Pytho And plunder it of its hoard of beautiful tripods and caldrons And gold and flashing iron in abundance and many fine garments. You shall see all of it, mother, if you desire.” So with such words they spoke one to another, Ffermes, The son of Zeus of the aegis, and heavenly Maia. Dawn, early-born, who brings light to mortals, was rising Out of deep-flowing Ocean when Phoebus Apollo 190 Came, on his way, to Onchestos, the lovely green grove Consecrate to Poseidon, loud-roaring Upholder of Earth. There the son of all-glorious Leto found the old man Grazing his beast by the path through the hedge of his courtyard. And Apollo, halting his strides, spoke first and addressed him; “Old man, you who gather the brambles of grassy Onchestos, I come to this place from Pieria seeking my cattle. All of the creatures cows, all having long crumpled horns. Part of my herd—the bull, blue-black, grazed alone. Away from the others. And fierce-eyed dogs followed after the herd— 200 Four, like-minded as men. But the dogs and the bull Were all left behind—a marvelous thing to have happened. The cows strayed off at the time the sun was just setting. Away from the soft, grassy meadow, away from the succulent pasture. Tell me, old man born long ago, if by chance you have seen Some man passing by on the road driving my cattle.” The old man, replying, then spoke to him in these words: “Dear friend, a difficult task to say all I have seen With my eyes. For many wayfarers pass back and forth On this road, some bent on evil, others on good. 2io Ffard would it be to know all about every one. But all day until sundown I was here in my vineyard Digging about, tending my fruitful vines. And I seemed, sir, to see—but I cannot certainly say— A young child, some boy, who herded before him horned cattle. An infant who carried a staff and roamed from one side to another. But, oddly, he drove the cows backwards, their heads facing toward him.” So spoke the old man, and Apollo, hearing his words. The more quickly went on his way. Not long thereafter Fie glimpsed a wide-winged bird of omen, and straightway he knew 220 That the culprit he sought was the child born of Zeus son of Cronos."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"170 HOMERIC HYMN TO HERMES So, concealed by a purple cloud around his broad shoulders, The son of Zeus, lord Apollo, rushed impetuously on To most holy Pylos in search of his sway-gaited cattle. Then he saw tracks, and Apollo, Far-Darter, cried out: “By my bow! What I see with my eyes is truly a wonder! These tracks are surely the hoofprints of fine long-horned cattle, But back they turn toward the asphodel meadow; these others— Such prints are not those of man nor yet those of woman. Nor of gray wolves, neither of bears, nor of lions, 230 Nor do I think they are those of a shaggy-necked centaur. This creature that takes such enormous strides on swift feet. Fearsome are these on this side of the path, more fearsome those on the other!” So saying, the son of Zeus, lord Apollo, sped on And came to the forest-clad peak of Cyllene, to the shadowy cavern Cut deep in the rock where Maia, the immortal nymph. Had brought forth to light the child of Zeus son of Cronos. A delicate fragrance hung over the hallowed mountain, And flocks of long-shanked sheep grazed on the grass. Far-shooting Apollo himself then stepped swiftly over 240 The threshold of stone and entered the cave dark with shadows. Now Hermes, the son of Zeus and of Maia, observing The wrath of Apollo, Far-Darter, concerning his cattle. Nestled deep into his sweet-smelling swaddling garments. As wood ash envelops the glowing embers of tree trunks. So Hermes buried himself when he saw the Far-Worker. He made of himself a small bundle, drawing up arms And legs toward his head, as though, fresh from his bath. He was drifting into sweet slumber. In truth, wide awake And watchful he lay, and held his lyre under his armpit. 250 But the son of Zeus and of Leto failed not to perceive Both the beautiful nymph of the mountains and her dear son. That little child, lying there wrapped in deceit. Intently, Apollo looked round the cavernous dwelling. Carefully peering into each dusky corner; Then with a shiny key he unlocked three cupboards. And found them full of nectar and lovely ambrosia. Much gold and silver lay also within them, and many Crimson and silvery robes of the nymph, such things As are kept in the sacred homes of the blessed immortals. 260 When he had searched every nook of the cavernous dwelling. The son of Leto turned and accosted glorious Hermes: “Boy, you who lie there in your wickerwork cradle. Tell me at once what you have done with my cows. Or we two shall fall out in a way neither seemly nor proper.

I could disclose Nothing about them, even to win a reward. I am not a strong man, not like a rustler of cattle. Not mine is this deed; I have quite other concerns. Sleep do I care for more, and the milk of my mother. To have swaddling clothes over my shoulders, and be given warm baths. Let no one hear from what matter this quarrel arose, 280 For it would be a great wonder among the immortals That a child newly born, a mere babe, should pass through the front door Driving before him cows of the field. What nonsense you speak! I was born yesterday. Soft are my feet and the ground beneath rough. But, if you wish, I will swear a great oath by the head of my father: Neither, I vow, am I myself guilty of what you accuse me. Nor have I seen any other thief stealing your cows— Whatever cows may be; I know them only by rumor.” So Hermes spoke, his shrewd eyes sparkling and twinkling. And he wiggled his eyebrows, glancing hither and yonder, 290 And absent-mindedly whistled, as if hearing an idle tale. Apollo who works from afar, softly laughing, replied: “You little imp, you deceiver, wily of mind. To hear you talk, I could well believe that last night You broke into many a well-furnished house, and left more than One poor wretch only the floor to sit on. While you soundlessly went through the rooms, stripping them bare. And many a shepherd dwelling alone in the fields Will you harass in the mountain glens when you hunger for meat And come upon herds of cattle and wool-bearing sheep. 300 But come, if you would not that this sleep now be your last. Get down out of your cradle, companion of black night. For now and hereafter this honor you hold among the immortals: You shall for all time be known as the prince among robbers.” So spoke Phoebus Apollo, and picked up the child And carried him off. But the mighty slayer of Argos, Musing as he was borne away in the arms of Apollo, Sent forth an omen—a rude, importunate herald— Exploding a belch from his belly, and followed that blast with a sneeze. Apollo, hearing him, let Hermes fall from his arms to the ground 310 And, though longing to be on his way, sat down before him And spoke a few words, gently gibing at Hermes: “Have no fear, little baby enveloped in swaddling clothes.

Oh, I would that the race of cows would perish, believe me! I did not steal your cows or see any other who did— Whatever cows may be; I know them only by rumor. But dispense and receive right before Zeus son of Cronos.” So over each separate term they disputed and wrangled, Hermes the shepherd and Leto s beautiful son. And each one held fast. But Apollo, with unerring voice Not without ground did he clash with glorious Hermes 330 Over his cows, but the wily Cyllenian tried With ruses and tricks and flattering words to deceive The lord of the silver bow. Yet, finding the other Fertile in tricks of his own, he of many devices. Leading, rapidly trotted ahead through the sand, And the son of Zeus and of Leto followed behind. Soon they came to the heights of sweet-smelling Olympus, The surpassingly beautiful children of Zeus son of Cronos, And to their father, for there lay the scale of justice for both. A convocation was being assembled on snow-capped Olympus, 340 And the undying gods gathered together just after gold-enthroned dawn. Hermes and lord Apollo, god of the silver bow. Stood side by side seeking judgment before the knees of their father. Then high-thundering Zeus spoke a word to his son shining in beauty: “Phoebus, where do you come from driving this winsome captive. This child newly born, having the look of a herald? Serious business, this, that you bring to the council of gods!” Lord Apollo who works from afar replied in return: “Father, you will soon hear an incredible tale. Though you taunt me and hold that I alone care for plunder. 350 I found a child—this very one—a burglar and thief. In the hills of Cyllene after traveling far through the land. Another such mocker have I never seen among gods. Or men, for that matter, as many swindlers on earth as there are. He stole my cows from their meadow and drove them away In the dusk of evening along the shore of the loud-roaring sea. Making directly for Pylos. The tracks behind him were double. The tracks of a monster, tracks to give rise to wonder. The spoor of an ingenious devil. As for the cows. The black dust proclaimed that their footsteps led toward the asphodel meadow. 360 He himself wandered aside from the path, and—I cannot explain it— Traversed the sandy places on neither his feet nor his hands.

A man, a mortal, noticed him heading for Pylos 370 Driving before him the herd of broad-fronted cattle. When he had quietly shut them in for the night. He returned to his home, playing with fire here and there on the way. Then silently as black night he crept into his cradle Down in the darkness of the dim cave—not even An eagle on watch would have spotted him with his sharp eyes. The child, when I charged him, rubbed his eyes hard, inventing fresh schemes. Then at once, careless of consequence, uttered a word: ‘I have not seen them or heard of them, nor have I had Word from another about them. I could disclose 380 Nothing about them, even to win a reward.’ ” When he had spoken, Phoebus Apollo sat down. Hermes then, standing opposite, made his defense. Pointing at Zeus son of Cronos, king of all gods. “Zeus, father, to you will I tell the absolute truth. For I am unfailingly honest and do not know how to lie. He came to our cave in search of his sway-gaited cows Early this morning, just as the sun was new-rising. None of the blessed gods had he brought along with him— No observer or witness—but with great show of force 390 Demanded of me to make known what I had done with his cows. And strongly threatened to hurl me down into broad Tartaros. He bears the delicate bloom of joyful young manhood. While I, a baby, was born yesterday—he too knows this. I am not a strong man, not like a drover of cattle. Believe me, for you profess to be my father too. I did not drive his cows home—so may I prosper!— Nor did I cross over the threshold.

To slaughter two cows, being so very newborn and helpless? I myself shudder to think of the strength to be yours Hereafter. There is no need for you to grow tall.

According to Homer, how do Zeus and his brothers decide on their respective spheres of influence? How does Zeus share power with various members of his family? 2. Why do you think that Greek myth uses the model of the human family to depict the gods? Discuss some of the family dynamics at work among the Olympians. 3. In what specific ways do the individual gods resemble human beings? In what respects are they qualitatively different? Discuss myth’s portrayal of the gods as it reveals a typically Greek anthropomorphism, humanism, individualism, and competitiveness, as well as an anthropocentric view of the universe. 4. In Homer’s song about the affair between Ares and Aphrodite, does the fact of di- vine adultery threaten the stability of the Olympian family or social structure? Why or why not? 5. In the Homeric Hymn to Hermes, how do the young god’s actions illustrate his unique qualities of inventiveness, roguery, and skillfulness in manipulating others to his own advantage? Why do you suppose the Greeks, who valued Zeus for upholding cosmic justice and the sacredness of the sworn oath, also accepted a lying and thieving god such as Hermes?

In Hesiod's cosmology, male aspirations to be like the gods in the enjoyment of perfect autonomy, freedom from labor, and extreme longevity are com- promised by the presence and demands of women, who subvert masculine values of order, independence, and dominion. In Works and Days, a primal Golden Age ends with the creation of Pandora, the gods’ means of punishing men for accepting the Promethean gift of fire. Alienatedfrom the gods, humanity’s condition declines rapidly, each stage of devolution repre- sented by a metal of inferior value to the one preceding it. Ages of Gold, Silver, and Bronze (and an interpolated Age of Heroes) culminate in the Age of Iron (the age during which Hesiod lived), characterized by injustice and strife. T I he dual themes of dynamic change and unending conflict that pervade Hesiod’s creation account also dominate his view of human history. In his second major poem, the Works and Days, which describes hu- manity’s steady decline from an original Golden Age, Hesiod praises Zeus for impos- ing lawful order on a previously chaotic universe but laments the undeniable fact that people are now much worse off than they were under Cronus’s rule. Deterioration in 180"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"The World in Decline 181 human society, Hesiod says, is a consequence of Zeus’s personal quarrel with Pro- metheus [proh-MEE-thee-uhs], the supremely cunning Titan who maneuvered Zeus into accepting the inferior part of animal sacrifices (see Chapter 2). Humdnitys Alienation from the Gods: Prometheus. Fire, and Pandora According to Hesiod, Zeus’s hostility toward early mankind (woman had not yet been created) springs from two acts by Prometheus’s that anger Zeus while significantly benefiting mortals. Prometheus tricks Zeus into reserving all the edible portions of animal sacrifices for human consumption, thereby enriching the human diet at the gods’ expense. The clever Titan then steals fire from heaven to give mortals the ability to cook their food, forge tools and weapons, and otherwise establish a dominion over nature that distinguishes humanity from all other creatures. Prometheus’s forbidden gift to humankind is a celestial flame that ignites the spark of civilization and further narrows the gap between gods and men. Furious at Prometheus’s subversion of his authority, the newly enthroned King of Heaven chains Prometheus to a mountain crag, where at dawn an eagle, Zeus’s “winged hound,” arrives to rip open the Titan’s body and feast on his liver (Fig- ure 6-1). Because he is immortal, Prometheus’s entrails grow back after each assault, only to be devoured again when the eagle returns later. The figure of Prometheus, whom Hesiod portrays as a mere trickster who deserves the punishment Zeus inflicts on him, has a far more complex role in Greek myth than Hesiod allows him. In other traditions, Prometheus was the divinity who created man, shaping him from clay and infusing him with life. Consistently concerned with human welfare, he is also the god who warns his mortal son Deucalion of Zeus’s plan to annihilate humanity in a global flood, directing him to build a boat so that Deu- calion and his wife, Pyrrha, can repopulate the world after the deluge recedes. (See the section “Humanity’s Destruction: Deucalion’s Flood,” later in the chapter.) The most complete treatment of Prometheus’s character, suffering, and motive for giving humankind the means to survive Zeus’s wrath and develop a technologically advanced culture appears in the tragedy ascribed to Aeschylus, Prometheus Bound. Whereas Hesiod recognizes neither altruism nor nobility of spirit in the Titan who courageously defies Zeus to aid helpless mortals, the author of Prometheus Bound explores the conflict between Zeus and Prometheus in terms of a crisis in the theo- logical evolution of the universe. (See Chapter 14 for the complete play.) In Hesiod’s vision of human prehistory, Prometheus’s interference with Zeus’s plans brings only woe to humankind. In the beginning, before the Titan’s rebellion, men “lived like gods,” mingling freely with the Olympians at their earthly banquets. Such divine-human socializing was possible because “men and gods” enjoyed a close kinship; they shared a “common descent” from the original mother, Gaea. After Prometheus gives mankind fire, however, with all its cultural benefits, Zeus deter- mines to counteract that gift by presenting men with his own “gift of evil” that will effectively spoil the Promethean enlightenment. He orders the most inventive divine artisans—Hermes, Athene, and Hephaestus—to create the first woman. Pandora (Figure 6-2)."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"182 The Myth ic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes FIGURE 6-1 The Eagle of Zeus. Perceived as both majestic and cruel, the eagle was not only “king of the air” but also a merciless predator that swept down on helpless prey, tearing it to pieces with razor-sharp talons. In the Prometheus myth, the eagle is Zeus’s “winged hound,” symbolizing both the god’s mastery of the atmosphere and his cruelty to the Titan who attempted to deceive him, as illustrated on this archaic cup. (Louvre, Paris) In giving etiological myth a religious interpretation that explains humanity’s alien- ation from divinity, Fdesiod emphasizes an interconnection among food, sacrifice, fire, cooking, and women. Man’s last banquet with the gods signals the end of an era because the introduction of fire to cook raw meat breaks human ties to nature. The guilt incurred in killing a fellow creature, the sacrificial ox, is compounded by (un- naturally) cooking and eating it. By contrast, Zeus’s eagle, which belongs to nature and is also a symbol of the god, eats raw flesh—Prometheus’s liver. The myth’s divi- sion of animal sacrifice into two disparate elements adds a further ambiguity: whereas the gods inhale only the intangible scent of burnt meat, men, as physical beings, must consume corruptible flesh to survive. Pandora, who arrives on the scene too late to dine with the gods but who, presumably, will preside over the civilized art of cooking, introduces yet another force dividing men from gods, the human race’s unresolved tension between male and female.

(British Museum, London) garding women as the catalyst of humanity’s historical decline. In both the Greek and biblical worldviews, the cosmos is run by and for a male principle of divinity that is regarded as simultaneously the source and the justification of a patriarchal society on earth. In the biblical and Hesiodic cosmologies alike, a previously all-male world order crumbles into chaos almost immediately after the first female is created. Fiesiod, whose personal distrust of women everywhere colors his account, wrote two significantly different versions of Pandora’s creation. In the Theogony, in which Pandora is not named, Fiesiod implies that only two gods, Fiephaestus and Athene, were responsible for manufacturing this “tempting snare.” In the Works and Days, a whole array of divine beings contributes specific qualities to fashion a complex crea- ture of irresistible beauty who also functions, paradoxically, as Zeus’s “evil” curse on mankind. After Fiephaestus molds Pandora of “earth and water,” giving her the face of a goddess, and Athene imbues her with domestic skills, a procession of divinities, including Aphrodite, the Graces, the Seasons, and eloquent Persuasion, equip her with attributes ranging from sexual allure to luxurious tastes—“a scourge for toiling men.” Finally, Fiermes endows Pandora with “the mind of a bitch and a thievish nature.” A trickster figure like Prometheus, Fiermes is Zeus’s instrument in giving men the feminine counterpart of the inferior animal sacrifice that Prometheus had led Zeus to accept at Mekone.

In Genesis 3, the author—whom scholars iden- tify as the Yahwist because he or she consistently uses the personal name Yahweh to denote Israels god—appropriates some of the same ancient Near Eastern traditions that the Greeks inherited. Like Hesiod, the Yahwist assumes that man existed in an ideal environment before God created womankind. The biblical author also echoes primordial traditions in associating Eve, the primal matriarch and “mother of all those who live” (Gen. 3:20) with distinctive symbols of the Goddess—a wise ser- pent, the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil (life and death), and the Tree of Life. It is to Eve, not her absent husband, to whom the serpent points out the desirability of becoming “like God.” After Eve leads the way in humanity’s assertion of selfhood—and the conse- quent alienation from an all-controlling Deity as well as from a previous childlike unity with nature—Yahweh expels Adam and Eve from Eden, the garden he had created them to “cultivate and take care of” (Gen. 2:16). (In Mesopotamian cre- ation myths, the gods fashion humanity for a similar purpose, to maintain the gods’ temples and parks.) Furious at humanity’s success in attaining divine knowledge, Yahweh states that, since the “man has become one of us [Yahweh and the other divine beings who make up the heavenly council], with his knowledge of good and evil, [h]e must not be allowed to [eat] . . . from the tree of life also . . . and live for ever” (Gen. 3:22). To prevent humanity from acquiring immortality, a jealously guarded divine prerogative, Yahweh orders “cherubs” (supernatural creatures who are part-animal and part-human) to bar the gates of Eden with a flaming sword. (To compare the two disparate creation accounts in Genesis, see the box in Chap- ter 3.) The Fall 3 The serpent was the most subtle of all the wild beasts that Yahweh God had made. It asked the woman, “Did God really say you were not to eat from any of the trees in the garden?” ’The woman answered the serpent, “We may eat the fruit of the trees in the garden. ’But of the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden God said, ‘You must not eat it, nor touch it, under pain of death,’ ” Then the serpent said to the woman, “No! You will not die! *God knows in fact that on the day you eat it your eyes will be opened and you will be like god, knowing good and evil.” ‘The woman saw that the tree was good to eat and pleasing to the eye, and that it was desirable for the knowledge that it could give. So she took some of its fruit and ate it. She gave some also to her husband who was with her, and he ate it. 'Then the eyes of both of them were opened and they realized that they were naked. So they sewed fig leaves together to make themselves loincloths. The man and his wife heard the sound of Yahweh God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from Yahweh God among the trees of the garden. 'But Yahweh God called to the man. “Where are you?” he asked. “I heard the sound of you in the garden,” he replied. “1 was afraid because I was naked, so I hid.” '“Who told you that you were naked?” he asked. “Have you been eating of"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"The World in Decline 185 the tree I forbade you to eat?” ’The man replied, “It was the woman you put with me; she gave me the fruit, and I ate it ” ‘Then Yahweh God asked the woman, “What is this you have done?” The woman replied, “The serpent tempted me and ate. Then Yahweh God said to the serpent, “Because you have done this, “Be accursed beyond all cattle, all wild beasts. you shall crawl on your belly and eat dust every day of your life. I will make you enemies of each other: you and the woman, your offspring and her offspring. It will crush your head and you will strike its heel.” To the woman he said: “I will multiply your pains in childbearing, you shall give birth to your children in pain. Your yearning shall be for your husband, yet he will lord it over you.” To the man he said, “Because you listened to the voice of your wife and ate from the tree of which I had forbidden you to eat, “Accursed be the soil because of you. With suffering shall you get your food from it every day of your life. It shall yield you brambles and thistles, and you shall eat wild plants. With sweat on your brow shall you eat your bread, until you return to the soil, as you were taken from it. For dust you are and to dust you shall return.” The man named his wife “Eve” because she was the mother of all those who live. ‘Yahweh God made clothes out of skins for the man and his wife, and they put them on. ‘Then Yahweh God said, “See, the man has become like one of us, with his knowledge of good and evil. He must not be allowed to stretch his hand out next and pick from the tree of life also, and eat some and live for ever.” ‘So Yahweh God expelled him from the garden of Eden, to till the soil from which he had been taken. -He banished the man, and in front of the garden of Eden he posted the cherubs, and the flame of a flashing sword, to guard the way to the tree of life."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"186 The Myth ic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes FIGURE 6-3 Epimetheus Accepting Pandora. In this vase painting, Zeus (far left) presides over his problem- atic gift to humanity—the first woman. Hermes, in a characteristic winged hel- met, looks to Zeus for in- structions as he persuades Epimetheus (Afterthought, second from the right) to accept Pandora, whose pres- ence among men will partly cancel out the benefits of the fire brought by Prome- theus. Pandora’s rising from the earth suggests her origin as divinely shaped clay. The figure of Eros hovering over Pandora indicates Epime- theus’s motive for ignoring his brother Prometheus’s warning not to accept any gift from the Olympian gods. (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford) In the Works and Days, Flesiod’s picture of many deities lavishing diverse gifts on Pandora provides the context for his interpretation of her name, which he says means “all-gifted.” Many scholars believe, however, that Elesiod either inherited or created a revised version of an older myth in which Pandora was originally an earth goddess called “Giver of All.” Instead of portraying her as an active embodiment of the Great Goddess’s generosity (see Chapter 4), Hesiod makes her the passive recipient of Olympian patriarchal largesse. Other versions of the Pandora myth indicate that the jar she brings with her contained not evils but blessings. In this tradition, Zeus gives her a jarful of good things as a wedding present for her marriage to Epimetheus [ep- ih-MEE-thee-uhs], who is a brother of Prometheus and whose name means “after- thought” (Figure 6-3). When she inadvertently opens the jar, all the blessings fly out and return to heaven, which accounts for the present imbalance of negative forces on earth. All these myths agree that Pandora, according to the divine purpose, catches Hope before it can escape, retaining the quality necessary to save humankind from despair. Hesiod’s narrative implies that, except for hope, the contents of Pandora’s jar were completely undesirable—disease, grief, hardship, and suffering, all the miseries that now afflict humankind. Even hope, as some critics suggest, may be an evil: it provides the illusion that life will improve, inducing people to bear the more transi- tory evils. Pandora’s arrival on earth thus ends the original Golden Age, shatters the link between humanity and divinity, and plunges human history into an irreversible"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"The World in Decline 187 downward spiral. As the feminine agent responsible for all of our subsequent misfor- tunes, Pandora serves the same mythic function as Eve in the Genesis story of Eden. According to Genesis 3, a serpent (representing the primordial Great Goddess’s wis- dom; see Chapter 4) persuades Eve to eat forbidden fruit, a symbol of earth’s fecun- dity. The fruit miraculously confers “knowledge of good and evil,” a phrase denoting awareness of the entire spectrum of existence, a breadth of vision hitherto the exclu- sive property of divine beings. The prohibited fruit is the biblical counterpart to Promethean fire, the enlightenment that makes civilization possible and simultane- ously severs humanity’s primal bond with nature (Eden) (see box pp. 184-185). After Eve convinces her husband to sample the fruit, the couple suddenly realize that they are naked, that unlike animals they are unprotected and open to harm— the first painful cut from knowledge’s two-edged sword. In rapid succession. Eve learns of her vulnerability to the pains of childbirth and to social domination by her male partner, Adam, whose name means “humankind.” Forced into a recognition of their inevitable deaths, the pair are expelled from paradise, because Yahweh, the bib- lical Creator, does not want them to rival him further. Already possessed of divine knowledge, they might also eat of the Tree of Life and live forever, giving humanity the two qualities that distinguish mortals from gods—cosmic perspective and im- mortality. Greek myth also associates fruit from the Tree of Life with a guardian serpent and protective goddesses (see Figure 4-6). The Bible and Greek myth similarly blame female curiosity (intelligence) for breaking the divine-human connection that prevailed when man existed alone with his patriarchal deity. Hesiod, like the author of Genesis, insists that the price hu- manity pays for knowledge—a dangerous and divine commodity associated with the serpentine feminine principle—is loss of innocence, loss of peace, and loss of para- dise, an environment in which no long-term threats to happiness are perceived. Like the post-Edenic world of Adam and Eve, what remains in Hesiod’s experience is labor, pain, and awareness of death. Despite his suspicion of women, however, even Hesiod admits that the gods’ female creation is, like the male of the species, “a mix- ture of good and bad”—in fact, a newly minted image of the contradictory system over which Zeus presides. When Hesiod states that Hermes endows Pandora with “lies, coaxing words, and a thievish nature,” he implicitly identifies her with Zeus’s first wife. Metis, the em- bodiment of cunning. Whereas Zeus could claim Metis’s mental acuity as his own by swallowing her, the human male cannot do the same with his mate, whose ability to manipulate her husband remains an external threat to his sense of masculine au- tonomy. In a Jungian interpretation, the Hesiodic male’s unwillingness or inability to value or nurture the potentially empowering feminine principle within (the anima) condemns him to an unremitting battle of the sexes. Humanity s Alienation from Nature as the Price of Civilization In the myths of Pandora and Eve, it is the action of a woman that severs hu- manity’s primal tie to nature. Some other traditions, however, take a more positive"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"188 The Myth ic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes view of women’s mythic role in helping the human psyche to distinguish itself from nature’s mindlessness. In the Mesopotamian story of Gilgamesh and Enkidu, the civilizing of a savage male is used to show that human culture is necessarily—and tragically—based on alienation from natural instincts. As the Greek gods fashion Pandora to punish man for his godlike control of fire, so the Mesopotamian gods create Enkidu, a wild, hairy, human animal, to provide a distraction and rival to Gilgamesh, a powerful king whose unfocused energies disrupt the state over which he rules. Like Adam before he tasted the fruit of knowledge, Enkidu identifies totally with nature, running naked with wild beasts and freeing them from traps laid by city dwellers. Only after a “holy one”—a priestess of the love goddess Ishtar—awakens his sexuality and teaches him the arts of civilization does Enkidu lose his affinity with the natural world. When animals, his former companions, flee from him because, thanks to the woman, he now carries the scent of humanity, Enkidu is forced to become a part of city life. He joins Gilgamesh in a heroic campaign against the de- structive aspects of nature, such as the fire monster Humbaba and the “bull of heaven,” a personification of drought and earthquake. When Gilgamesh spurns Ishtar’s offer of love in favor of bonding with Enkidu, whom he loves as a second self, the outraged goddess afflicts Enkidu with a ter- minal sickness. On his deathbed, Enkidu bitterly curses Ishtar’s priestess, a temple prostitute, for having ensnared him in the net of civilization. Hearing Enkidu’s dying words, the sun god Shamash wisely reminds him that his gains from acculturation— adventure, fame, and the love of Gilgamesh—far outweigh the loss of his orig- inal status as unencumbered natural man. Enkidu then pronounces a grateful bless- ing on the woman who initiated him into the larger possibilities of civilized awareness. Hesiod’s failure to perceive or articulate a comparable tribute to the feminine prin- ciple, though not shared by all Greek writers, characterizes much of his culture. Greek mythology, like the patriarchal society it reflects, is essentially a male mythology. A few Greek heroes, such as Perseus and Odysseus, learn to value and assimilate femi- nine wisdom (see Ghapters 10 and 12), but female intelligence and assertiveness, the qualities of a Glytemnestra or Medea, are typically seen as threats to male security (see Ghapters 15 and 17). The Two Natures o f Strife In a cosmos organized on the principles of male competition and conflict, one in which the gods constantly battle or conspire against each other, it is not surprising that Hesiod regarded human wars and violence as inescapable. He saw the entire cosmos as permeated with manifestations of Strife (Eris), a personification of discord that takes tw^o distinctive forms. Although both versions are daughters of Night, an offspring of Ghaos, they are not equally bad. The first Strife triggers mindless aggres- sion, driving men to slaughter each other; the second figure of Strife is milder, inspir- ing healthy competition and a striving after excellence that inspires people to produce their finest work, thus benefiting the entire community."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"The World in Decline 189 The Five A ges of Humanity The Age of Gold The Works and Days divides human history into five distinctive periods, all but one of which (the Age of Heroes) is symbolized by a metal more valuable than that which chronologically follows it. The initial Age of Gold, synonymous with the paradise that men inhabited before woman was created, flourished when Cronus ruled the world. Hesiod includes no account of man’s creation, perhaps because he regarded the primal race as autochthonous (spontaneously born from the earth). According to a variant myth Apollodorus records, Prometheus was humanity’s creator, fashioning man from earth and water. Even if Hesiod knew this tradition, his disdain for Pro- metheus as a mere trickster who was justly punished for breaking Zeus’s law would explain his omitting the story. During this Age of Gold, aboriginal men live in peace and enjoy the same freedom from toil or anxiety the gods possess. Like pure gold that never decays or rusts, hu- mans live unblemished by old age or hardship until death takes them in the gentle guise of sleep. Even after their bodies perish, their indomitable spirits roam the earth, acting as invisible protectors and helpers of later generations. The Age of Silver Whereas Golden Age inhabitants are peaceful, all subsequent generations are perpe- trators or victims of Strife’s worst manifestation, bloody war. Represented by a less pure or costly metal, the Age of Silver demonstrates Hesiod’s belief that each new historical epoch is inferior to the one before it and emphasizes a marked deterioration in the human condition. This second age is characterized by extreme opposites: people take a full hundred years to mature, but after leaving their “prudent mothers” (one of Hesiod’s rare allusions to women’s beneficent roles), they live only a short time, cut off by “reckless violence.” Although enjoying a century of preparation for life, as adults they behave like fools: they are the first race the Olympians directly create, but they refuse to acknowledge or worship their creators, a defect that prompts Zeus to order their extinction. This failed experiment, which Hesiod oddly labels “blessed,” does not haunt earth’s surface, as do specters of the Age of Gold, but is confined beneath the earth. The Age of Bronze Men of the third period are created by Zeus alone, reputedly from ash trees.

Described as “better and more just” than the races that precede or succeed them, the mortals of this age are the great heroes who fight at Troy or Thebes. Most of these soldiers, whose deeds are celebrated in the Homeric epics, manage to kill each other off in their endless wars, but some of the noblest Zeus carries away to a remote paradise where they enjoy conditions that prevailed during the vanished Golden Age. This Edenic reward, reserved exclusively for Zeus’s few favorites, corresponds to Homer’s Elysium (or Isles of the Blest), to which the Olympian transports his son-in-law Menelaus (see Chapter 9). Scholars believe that Hesiod’s passage about Greek heroes—to which he assigns no characteristic metal and which interrupts the otherwise consistent historical de- cline—was inserted into an older tradition of four regressive ages that the Greeks borrowed from ancient Near Eastern sources. The biblical Book of Daniel offers a parallel tradition in which a huge statue, composed of four different metals, symbol- izes a succession of four historical empires. The idol has a head of gold, chest and arms of silver, belly and thighs of bronze, legs of iron, and feet of mixed iron and clay. Daniel’s vision of historical decline, echoing Hesiod’s older image of historical epochs as increasingly degenerative, has helped to keep the myth of humanity’s post- Edenic devolution alive in some Judeo-Christian circles. The Age of Iron The fifth and final epoch, that in which the poet and his audience lived, is the brutal Age of Iron. The least precious and most harsh metal, iron effectively symbolizes the hardness of heart that distinguishes the petty kings who economically exploit the class of impoverished small farmers and shepherds to which Hesiod belonged. The situ- ation will only worsen, for Zeus already plans to wipe out the present generation as he had its forebears. Increasing signs of degeneracy will mark the end’s approach: life will be so unbearable that even newborn infants will have gray hair. Natural affection among family members will disappear, and the normal social order will be reversed, with good men punished and evil rewarded. Qualities, such as Shame, that now hold wickedness in check, will flee in horror to Olympus, abandoning humanity to misery and grief. Hesiod’s view of history arbitrarily divided into five epochs of intensifying decline is essentially apocalyptic: he assumes not merely one end of the world—the doom rapidly overtaking the present system—but also four earlier, divinely ordained mass extinctions. The gods thoroughly eradicate each successive race, allowing no survivors of one era to found the next and preventing any normal historical continuity. Human history, which flows inevitably toward the abyss, is thus a painful lesson teaching mortals that “there is no way to escape the designs of Zeus” (Eigure 6-4).

Ancient Sumerian and Babylonian texts refer to a great deluge in which the gods wiped out all of humanity except for one family, which survived by building a boat to ride out the catastrophe. Extensive accounts of the deluge appear in the Atrahasis Epic and the Epic of Gilga- mesh, which influenced not only the Greeks but also the authors of Genesis, who preserve the most famous version of this ancient Near Eastern story. In the Gilgamesh epic, Enlil, the irritable god of storm, determines to eliminate the human race by drowning all of earth’s inhabitants. Enlil’s destructiveness is op- posed by Ea, a god of wisdom and compassion, who preserves a seed of humanity by warning Utnapishtim, the Babylonian Noah, of the coming disaster. Following Ea’s instructions to build an ark and stock it with all kinds of animals, Utnapishtim and his wife survive the world’s return to a watery chaos. When the flood is over, Utna- pishtim sends out birds to find dry land, leaves the ark grounded on a high mountain, and offers sacrifices to the gods. In the Greco-Roman flood story, which is most fully preserved in Ovid’s Metamorphoses, Zeus brings on the deluge, and Prometheus takes Ea’s role, alerting his son Deucalion and Deucalion’s wife, Pyrrha, to the danger and directing them to construct a boat, thus ensuring humanity’s continued existence. As in his arrangement of sacrificial offerings and his gift of fire, Prometheus is successful in circumventing Zeus’s intentions and benefiting humanity. According to Ovid and Apollodorus, after the flood waters recede, an oracle from Themis, the wise mother of Prometheus, commands the pair to repopulate the world by casting the bones of their mother. Recognizing the earth, Gaea, as their maternal parent, Deucalion and Pyrrha obey the oracle by tossing fragments of earth’s “bones”—rocks—over their shoulders. Stones that Deucalion throws become men; those that Pyrrha throws be- come women—thus explaining the source of humanity’s presently flinty nature. As Genesis makes the three sons of Noah the progenitors of all branches of the human race known to the early Bible writers, so Greek myth presents Deucalion and Pyrrha as the parents of Hellen, the eponymous ancestor (the person from whom a group reputedly takes its name) of the Greeks. In Hellen’s honor, the historical Greeks called themselves Hellenes [HEL-lee-neez] and their country Hellas [HEL- luhs]. Although Hesiod’s poems provided the Greeks with a mythic past that serves the purpose of history—typically using ancient tales to justify retroactively the practices of Hellenic society—Hesiod leaves many important questions unanswered. The ten- sion between Hesiod’s admiration for Zeus and his awareness that the god is largely responsible for humanity’s pain goes unresolved. It is left to a much more sophisti- cated poet, the Athenian playwright Aeschylus, to explore the issue of Zeus’s ethical character and its implications for humankind (see Chapter 14)."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"WORKS AND DAYS' Hesiod Pierian Muses, your songs bring fame and glory.

Yes, Zeus who thunders from his lofty dwelling with ease straightens the crooked and shrivels the insolent. Hark and see, O Zeus! Let your decrees be straight and fair! And I will speak to Perses the naked truth: There was never one kind of Strife. Indeed on this earth two kinds exist. The one is praised by her friends, the other found blameworthy. These two are not of one mind. The one—so harsh—fosters evil war and the fray of battle. No man loves this oppressive Strife, but compulsion and divine will grant her a share of honor. The other one is black Night’s elder daughter; and the son of Kronos, who dwells on ethereal heights, planted her in the roots of the earth and among men.

But Zeus was angered in his heart and hid the means to life because Prometheus with his crooked schemes had cheated him. This is why Zeus devised sorrows and troubles for men. He hid fire. But Prometheus, noble son of lapetos, stole it back for man from Zeus, whose counsels are many. In the hollow of a fennel stalk he slipped it away, unnoticed by Zeus, who delights in thunder. So the cloud-gatherer in anger said to him: “Son of lapetos, there is none craftier than you, and you rejoice at tricking my wits and stealing the fire which will be a curse to you and to the generations that follow. The price for the stolen fire will be a gift of evil to charm the hearts of all men as they hug their own doom.” This said, the father of gods and men roared with laughter. Then he ordered widely acclaimed Hephaistos to mix earth with water with all haste and place in them human voice and strength.

Helpless old age did not exist, and with limbs of unsagging vigor they enjoyed the delights of feasts, out of evils reach.

But the earth covered this race, and they became holy spirits that haunt it, benign protectors of mortals that drive harm away and keep a watchful eye over lawsuits and wicked deeds, swathed in misty veils as they wander over the earth. They are givers of wealth by kingly prerogative. The gods of Olympos made a second race — a much worse one—this time of silver, unlike the golden one in thought or looks. 130 For a hundred years they were nurtured by their prudent mothers as playful children — each a big baby in his house— but when they grew up and reached adolescence they lived only for a short while, plagued by the pains of foolishness.

In time Zeus, son of Kronos, was angered and buried them because they denied the blessed Olympians their due honors. 140 The earth covered this race, too; they dwell under the ground and are called blessed mortals— they are second but, still, greatly honored. Zeus the father made a third race of mortals, this time of bronze, not at all like the silver one.

No one could come near them, for their strength was great and mighty arms grew from the shoulders of their sturdy bodies. 150 Bronze were their weapons, bronze their homes and bronze was what they worked—there was no black iron then. With their hands they worked one another’s destruction and they reached the dank home of cold Hades nameless.

In what re- spects is the first woman a “lovely evil”? How does she resemble Eve in the Book of Genesis? Why do both Zeus and the biblical Yahweh try to prevent human beings from acquiring forbidden knowledge? 2. Describe Hesiod’s view of the two Strifes, and explain their role in the devolving his- tory of humankind. Describe the four metallic ages and the Age of Heroes. Why does Hesiod regard human history as characterized by a downward spiral toward ultimate calamity? 3. Discuss the mythic themes of a lost Golden Age and primal fall from grace that appear in both Greek and biblical traditions. Gan a Freudian or Jungian approach help ex- plain this persistent myth? 4. What is Strife’s (Eris’s) function in Hesiod’s concept of the world order? 5. Summarize the myth of Deucalion’s flood, showing its parallels to Mesopotamian and biblical deluge stories.

Apollo’s word (oracle) was transmitted through his virgin priestess, the Pythia, named in honor of the Pythof'i, which Apollo slew when he estab- lished his Delphic rule. A sanetuary where myth and ritual combined to affrm humanity’s communion with divine powers, Delphi linked the worlds of flesh and spirit. I wo of Zeus’s sons—Apollo and Diony- sus— embody strikingly different aspects of the human psyche: rational intellect and instinctual sensuality. Perhaps because these two forces, and the tension between them, are so crucial in human experience, the two young gods—more than any other of Zeus’s male children—inspired myths and ceremonies that profoundly influenced Greek life. The worship of Dionysus, expressing life’s dangerous mutability, gave birth to the Athenian tragic drama (see Chapter 13); the cult of Apollo created a practical institution that allowed humans to communicate, albeit imperfectly, with the gods (Figure 7-1). The Shrine at Delphi: Communing with the Gods Whereas the living could visit Olympus or Hades only in their imagination, the Greeks believed that a few sacred places on earth also provided limited access to the invisible realm of divine beings.

Aloof and remote, Apollo transmitted Zeus’s will through a series of mediators, commonly phrasing his responses in cryptic terms more comprehensible to other gods than to the human questioners. The prophetic shrines, the gods’ words spoken there, and the persons authorized to convey and interpret a deity’s typically obscure messages were all designated by the term oracle. One of the oldest oracles was that of Zeus at Dodona in Epirus, where the Olympian’s utterances were said to issue from a sacred oak tree, perhaps via the sound of the wind rustling its leaves. A few foreign oracles, particularly that of Zeus Ammon at Siwa in the Libyan desert, which was consulted by Alexander the Great, also enjoyed a high reputation among the Greeks. By far the most popular and influential oracle, however, was that of Apollo at Delphi [DEL-phee], to which thousands of Greeks flocked each year to seek enlight- enment from their god.

The social and spiritual centrality of Delphi was ex- pressed in the myth that Apollo’s sacred place of worship was literally the geographic center of the world: it is the place where Zeus’s two eagles met when, departing from the same point, they flew at equal speeds around the globe. Delphi’s connection with themes of birth and rebirth is suggested by its name, which means “womb,” and the presence of the ompha- los, a stone depicting earth’s navel.

These miniature temples, crammed with treasures, were erected in gratitude for (or in hope of eliciting) the god’s wise counsel and diplomatic intervention in settling political disputes both at home and abroad. Although some complained that the Delphic priesthood overly favored Sparta and other conservative states, Apollo’s oracles were generally peaceful in tone and calculated to promote a viable balance of political power and harmony among Greece’s many warring factions. The facade of Apollo’s temple was inscribed with maxims that urged the Greeks to practice moderation: “Nothing in Excess” and “Know Yourself”—an exhortation to remember one’s human limitations and to avoid behaving as if one were a god (Figure 7-4), Delphi’s centrality in Greek religion was expressed in the belief that it stood at the exact center of earth’s surface. Zeus, it was said, had released two equally swift eagles that flew in opposite directions around the globe; they met at Delphi, where an an- cient carved stone, perhaps a meteor fragment, the omphalos (Figure 7-5), was kept in the temple and identified as the navel of the earth.

Prehistoric Delphi Positioned at the foot of two soaring rocky cliffs, the Phedriads, Delphi was regarded as a holy site long before Apollo’s arrival there. Besides its spectacular mountainscape, the site was famous as a place where some persons experienced the invisible presence of divine beings willing to commune with mortals. In Aeschylus’s play the Eumenides, the Pythia summarizes Delphi’s prehistory, not- ing that Apollo’s rule followed that held by several ancient goddesses. After Gaea, the primordial fount of wisdom, came her equally wise daughter Themis [THEE-mis] (Eternal Law), who was Zeus’s second wife and one of the few Titans to remain influential under Olympian jurisdiction. An aspect of the Great Goddess, Themis taught her male successor the art of prophecy, a debt Apollo acknowledged by al- lowing Themis’s priestesses to continue officiating at a small altar within Delphi’s precincts. Apollo s Prehistory Just as Delphi has a complex history of religious development, so does the figure of the god who eventually came to dominate it. Although Apollo does not appear in the Linear B texts under that name, the term Paian or Paion is listed among the gods at Knossos during the Mycenaean period. In Homer, this term is applied both to a god of healing and to Apollo in his dual role of healer and bringer of pestilence, an office featured prominently in Book 1 of the Iliad and in Sophocles’ play Oedipus Rex (see Ghapters 11 and 16). The same term, rendered in English as paean, is given to Apollo’s cult hymn, named for its repeated cry ie Paian,” which was used as a refrain. According to tradition, the paean was introduced from Crete to Sparta early in the seventh century B.C. and was performed at Apollo’s Spartan festivals. Lacking evidence that Apollo was worshiped during the Bronze Age, most scholars believe that Apollo’s cult became prominent only during the Dark Ages following the collapse of Mycenaean civilization in the twelfth century B.C. (see Chapter 1). By the Archaic period, when the oral traditions underlying the epics of Homer and Hesiod evolved, the concept of Apollo was already well developed. Both the Iliad and the Odyssey refer to his oracular shrine at Delphi and/or his sacred birthplace on the remote island of Delos. Although Apollo’s origins remain uncertain (he was not origi- nally a sun god), some scholars trace aspects of his cult to the Dorian word apella, or “assembly,” an annual gathering of adult males at which initiated youths were admit- ted to the social group. Apollo and Initiation Apollo’s connection with young men, their education, and their initiation into adult society is central to his religious significance. Consistently depicted in art as youthful, long-haired, handsome, and athletic, Apollo is the eternal ephebe, a term designating a class of youths, approximately eighteen to twenty years old, who underwent system-"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"In Touch with the Gods 205 atic educational and physical training in order to serve the polis as hoplites (heavily armed infantrymen). Apollo’s association with the Muses—patrons of poetry, song, dance, and music—probably stems from his function as educator of young men, who studied the arts as part of their preparation for military service and other obligations of full citizenship. In time, Apollo also became the patron of philosophy, so involved in the promotion of rationality and logical thought that, according to one source, he became the father of Plato, the foremost thinker of classical Greece. Presiding over the ephebes’ rite of passage from boyhood to full citizenship and military responsibility, Apollo received the sacrifice of their long hair, which was cut short as part of a ritual symbolizing the youths’ transition to a new stage of life. Some scholars regard Achilles, a young warrior without wife or family, as a salient example of the ephebe, a novice soldier who fights far from home at Troy to win the respect of his peers. Apollo and the Dragon: The Transition from Earth Goddess to Sky God As if reflecting the historical transition from chthonic powers to Olympian sky gods (see Chapter 4), myths about the establishment of Apollo’s worship at Delphi involve an epochal battle between female and male principles of divinity. According to the Homeric Hymn to Pythian Apollo, the single most important account of Apollo’s mythic origins, the conflict originates in Hera’s anger toward Zeus for having pro- duced Athene by himself. As granddaughter of Gaea and as the Queen of Heaven, Hera inherits the Great Goddess’s prerogatives and feels outrage when Zeus ignores her exclusive right to bear divine children. After her attempt to duplicate Zeus’s re- productive autonomy results only in the malformed Hephaestus, Hera abandons her husband’s bed and, without male help, conceives and bears Typhon (Typhoeus), the monstrous serpent whose strength rivals that of Zeus. She entrusts Typhon’s upbring- ing to Python [PYE-thuhn], a female dragon who guards the ancient sanctuary of Gaea and Themis at Delphi. According to the Delphic hymn, the monster does not challenge Zeus directly, but is associated with Python, the serpent who will threaten Zeus’s noblest son, Apollo. (Compare Hesiod’s account in the Theogony, in which Gaea, not Hera, is the dragon’s mother; see Chapter 3.) Apollo s Birth Birth stories about an infant predestined for unusual achievement, whether as a na- tional leader or future god—such as the biblical Moses or Jesus of Nazareth— typically involve grave dangers from which the child narrowly escapes.

Apollo later trans- forms his birthplace into the island of Delos, permanently fixing it in the midst of the Cyclades, where it became an important religious center honoring Zeus’s Olympian twins. Serving an etiological function, this tale accounts for Delos’s name (meaning “brilliant”) because it was here that the god of light first beheld the sun’s bright rays. Festivals and Ceremonies o f Delphi The Pythian Games Whereas the first part of the Hymn to Pythian Apollo tells the story of Apollo’s birth, the second part (composed earlier, in the seventh century B.C.) narrates the god’s founding of his oracular shrine at Pytho (Delphi). After traversing Greece and settling at Delphi, Apollo faces an immediate challenge to his new cult. Python, reputedly a child of Gaea and mentor of Typhon (embodiment of Hera’s bitter hatred of Zeus’s patriarchy), ravages the countryside, slaughtering sheep and humans alike. Only three days old, Apollo achieves his first victory with the bow, shooting an arrow through Python and ridding the world of a destructive pest. In memory of this feat, Apollo’s Delphic Oracle, a virgin prophetess empowered to speak in his name, is called the Pythia [PITH -ee-uh]. Further commemorating Python’s defeat, Apollo establishes the Pythian Games (Figure 7-6), which were held every fourth year and were second only to the Olympics as Greece’s foremost athletic competition. As befits a festival honoring the Muses’ patron, the Pythian Games also emphasized performances in music, poetry, and dance. The Stepterion: Guilt and Purification Although Apollo must eradicate his older rival in order to found his Delphic rites, he readily acknowledges moral responsibility for having slain Python, the serpent guardian of Gaea’s ancient shrine. Voluntarily exiling himself from Olympus, Apollo withdraws to the valley of Tempe, where he works as a shepherd for King Admetus. Setting the example of a god who performs slave labor to purge himself of guilt, Apollo creates a paradigm of expiation for mortals who seek to purify themselves (Figure 7-7). After his purification, Apollo, crowned with laurel leaves, returns to Delphi at midsummer and inaugurates the first Pythia, Herophile, who is inspired to foretell the Trojan War. Because of Apollo’s example, Delphi became a holy asylum where exiles could ritualistically rid themselves of moral pollution, as Orestes does when he is cleansed with sacrificial pig’s blood, ceremonially, if not legally or ethically, absolving him from the crime of having murdered his mother (see Figure 15-10). In general, Apollo’s Delphic myth helped to promote a more humane moral order in which Greek society was encouraged to abandon its ancient demands for bloody retaliation by recognizing the superiority of justice tempered with mercy—an innovation that Aeschylus cele- brates in his Oresteia (see Ghapter 15). In classical times, every eight years the priests of Delphi reenacted Apollo’s slaying of Python in a religious drama called the Stepterion.

After launching an arrow into the hut and supposedly killing the hidden serpent, the boy then pantomimed Apollo’s flight to Tempe, where the god atoned for Python’s death. Consulting the Oracle Persons wishing to ask questions of the Pythia followed a strictly regulated procedure: applicants first washed themselves in water from the nearby Castalia Spring; paid a fee, the size of which was determined by officiating priests; and sacrificed an animal, usually a sheep or goat that was “perfect,” in the sense that it had no visible defects. Before the animal’s throat was cut on Apollo’s altar, priests doused it with cold spring water; if the lamb shivered or trembled, the day was deemed propitious, and the god could be expected to offer a reply. After washing in Castalia’s waters, the Pythia, accompanied by priests similarly purified, entered the temple, where she burned an offering of laurel and barley flour in a sacred flame kept perpetually alight on Apollo’s hearth. The priestess then de- scended into an underground chamber where she seated herself on a tripod, a high three-legged stand that normally held a bowl or cauldron used in cooking (Fig- ure 7-8). Using the tripod as a stool, she sat preparing to receive the god’s spirit.

Hold- ing a laurel branch in one hand, Apollo’s virgin priestess gazes intently at the contents of a bowl she holds in her other hand, perhaps reading there an answer to the question posed by the petitioner standing before her. At the height of its reputation, during the sixth and fifth centuries B.C., Delphi attracted pilgrims from throughout the eastern Mediterranean world.

The Pythia’s reply was mild: if Croesus did not understand the first oracle, he should have made a second inquiry. During the two Persian invasions of Greece (490 and 480-479 B.C.), the Delphic Oracle at first seemed to favor submitting to the hitherto undefeated Persian armies, perhaps to avoid the severe reprisals that the invaders would inflict after overcoming Greek resistance. When at last the Pythia reluctantly conceded that the Greeks could place their trust in “the wooden wall,” Themistocles, Athens’s resourceful leader, argued that Apollo advised relying on the Greeks’ warships.

The oracle’s part in the Persian Wars offers an interesting example of a religious institution whose authority was based on myth exerting a significant influence on historical events. Sophocles used one of the oldest myths, that of Oedipus and his doomed royal house of Thebes, to dramatize the infallibility of Apollo’s Delphic pronouncements. Oedipus’s career and those of his equally tragic children, Antigone, Eteocles, and Polyneices—hedged about by cryptic oracles—serve to confirm that the god speaks truly through his priestess and that no one can escape fulfilling Delphi’s prophecies. (See Chapter 16, Sophocles’ Oedipus Rex.) Despite such unqualified suppott as Sophocles gave in his Oedipus plays, Delphi’s prestige rapidly declined after the fifth century B.C. With the rise of Macedonian imperialism, under King Philip and his son Alexander, Greek city-states like Attica and Boeotia (the state bordering Delphi) were absorbed into a larger political system and lost much of their confidence in divine institutions, along with their autonomy. After Rome seized final control of Greece in 146 B.C., Delphi became even more a religious curiosity or cultural artifact than a source of living faith. A few Roman emperors—such as Hadrian and his friend Herodes Atticus—provided money to rebuild its stadium and restore its shrines, but even before new gods arrived from Palestine and declared Apollo’s cult obsolete, the sanctuary had fallen into disuse and ruin (Figure 7-9). When Julian (A.D. 360—363), the only non-Christian emperor"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"In Touch with the Gods 211 after Constantine, attempted to revive worship of the classical gods and sent an envoy to Delphi, it is said that an aged Pythia gave this response: Tell the king the fairwrought hall has fallen to the ground, no longer has Phoebus a hut, nor a prophetic laurel, nor a spring that speaks. The water of speech even is quenched. Apollo s Loves Although the exemplar of manly beauty, Apollo was unlucky in love. The story of his first, and unrequited, passion foreshadows his legacy of loss and sexual frustration. When he pursues Daphne, a mountain nymph, she flees him like the plague, praying (in some traditions) to Zeus to preserve her virginity. In an instant. Daphne is changed into a bay or laurel tree, leaving her pursuer inconsolable. As a memorial of his unconsummated love, Apollo makes a crown of laurel leaves, an emblem that was later awarded to victors in the Pythian Games. Apollo also loved a youth named Cyparissus, who in turn was devoted to a pet stag. When Cyparissus accidentally kills the stag, he resolves to die himself, grieving so intensely for his animal friend that he refuses Apollo’s pleas to transfer his affec- tion to the god. Drained by excessive weeping, he gradually loses his human form and is transformed into a cypress. Even today a scattering of cypress trees punctuates the rocky slopes of Parnassus, standing as upright, evergreen reminders of Apollo’s passion. In the god’s most celebrated affair, a stunningly handsome boy named Hyacin- thus is the object of Apollo’s desire. Although this time the god’s affection is returned, the relationship still ends unhappily. While throwing the discus together, a favorite pastime of Greek lovers, Hyacinthus, perhaps accidentally, steps in the way of Apollo’s hurtling discus, which strikes him fatally in the head. (One version of the myth states that Zephyrus, the West Wind, also loved Hyacinthus and, when spurned by the youth, jealously diverts the discus’s trajectory, causing it to strike the young man.) His mind indelibly imprinted by the sight of blood streaming over Hyacinthus’s white skin, Apollo transforms the boy’s corpse into a flower whose white petals are marked in red, mimicking the letters AI, signifying the Greeks’ cry of sorrow. Although these myths of unfulfilled love provide etiologies of various plants or blossoms, symbols of the ephemerality of mortal youth and beauty, the story of Apollo and Coronis, equally unsatisfying to the god, serves a different purpose. Co- ronis, a princess of Thessaly, is already pregnant by Apollo when she leaves Zeus’s most attractive son for a human lover. According to one tradition, the god is in- formed of Goronis’s humiliating infidelity with a mere mortal by a gossipy crow; in Pindar’s version of the tale, the all-seeing god does not need a bird of ill omen to bring the bad news: he discerns the truth himself and sends his sister Artemis to kill Goronis for her treachery. The unborn child is preserved, however, and given to Chiron, wisest of the cen- taurs, to raise.

Myth presents Asclepius as so potent a healer that he restores even the dead to life. Zeus ends this disruption of natural processes—and assertion of human skill against the lim- its of mortality—by killing Asclepius, an act that outrages Apollo and brings him temporarily into conflict with heaven’s king.

Outraged at his son’s undeserved fate, Apollo promptly retaliates by killing the Cyclops who had forged Zeus’s light- ning. Regarding Apollo’s act as rebellion, Zeus momentarily contemplates imprison- ing the god of light in Tartarus’s infernal darkness. Closely associated with that of Apollo, the cult of Asclepius, whom tradition granted posthumous immortality, flourished throughout Greece. When pilgrims vis- ited the rural shrine at Epidaurus, where Asclepius’s most famous temple stood, they followed a peculiar ritual in which reptilian symbols of Gaea and other chthonic goddesses played a major part. (Both Apollo and Asclepian practitioners bore the caduceus, with its two serpents entwined about a staff, which some mythographers interpret as a phallic symbol and others as a representation of the Tree of Life, an image associated with the Great Goddess’s powers of regeneration.) Patients seeking a cure slept overnight on the temple floor, typically experiencing incubation, the receiving of dreams in which the god prescribes the method of healing.

As god of the vine and bestower of intoxication, he shatters conventional restraints and permits human beings to act out extremes of emotion and behavior. Some later Greek poets and mystics linked Dionysus’s cult with that of Orpheus, emphasizing the god’s connections with the Underworld and spiritual regeneration. Dionysus and Apollo: Contrasts and Connections Greek tradition held that each year Apollo left his sanctuary at Delphi to live with the Hyperboreans, a mythical tribe inhabiting the extreme north, an unexpectedly idyllic region ruled by Boreas (North Wind). During Apollo s seasonal absence, Dio- nysus reigned in Delphi for the three winter months. A more radical change in divine patronage is difficult to imagine: Apollo, symbol of moderation and mental balance, is replaced by an irrational power that liberates human beings to explore their poten- tial for emotional and behavioral extremes (Figure 8-1). In the absence of rational control, the unconscious, with all its amoral energy, is allowed to flourish. Despite their fundamental differences, however, Apollo and Dionysus share some important qualities. As sons of Zeus by different mothers, the two half-brothers mani- fest their father’s indomitable will to power, as well as his creative drive. Born under dif- ficult, even bizarre circumstances, both gods spend their early youth recruiting new worshipers, establishing their respective cults, and winning general recognition of their divinity. Although Apollo is identified with disciplined intellect and Dionysus with spontaneous emotion, both are associated with the phenomenon of ecstasy, a term meaning “to stand outside oneself,” to abandon rational control and surrender oneself to an overwhelming emotion.

In this mosaic from Delos, birthplace of Apollo and vAttemis, a sullen and heavy-eyed Dionysus carries a thyrsus and a timbrel (a small, drumlike instrument beaten to hypnotic rhythms). Music, song, and dance were im- portant in the cults of both Apollo and Dionysus, but the wine god’s followers typically gave impassioned performances of a wild, ecstatic nature—a stark contrast to the limpid melodies of Apollo’s lyre. In this rendition, the panther is even larger than the god, an indication of the untamed and dangerous animal power inherent in Dionysian impulses.

Apollo and Dionysus are, in fact, two equally important aspects of the human psyche, which, like the Delphic administration, alternates be- tween conscious self-discipline and emotional self-abandonment. In strikingly differ- ent ways, both gods transcend the limits of flesh to link humanity with divinity. The two Greek gods most closely identified with artistic creativity, Apollo and Dionysus both inspire poetry, song, and dance. Their musical styles, however, are strongly opposed: Apollo’s golden lyre, with its limpid melodies, evokes feelings of harmony and serenity.

This cup painting shows a maenad, a nymph or woman possessed by Dionysus’s spirit, carrying a thyrsus and the body of a small panther. Unlike the formal Olympian religion, the cult of Dionysus al- lowed the expression of ex- treme emotion. Caught up in the spirit of frenzied mu- sic and dance, the wor- shiper could experience ec- stasy, a joyous feeling in which the celebrant tempo- rarily escaped the limita- tions of the self and experi- enced a sense of union with the divine. Confined to narrow roles in most Greek society, women could enjoy an orgiastic liberation at various Dionysian festivals. (Museum Antiker Kleinkunst, Munich) sing the paean, an elegantly lyrical hymn of praise, Dionysus’s followers perform the dithyramb [DITH-ram], a cacophonous choral dance from which, according to Ar- istotle, the tragic drama evolved. The Dionysian Myth Historical Origins Although some myths present Dionysus as a god foreign to Greek culture, his name appears in ancient Mycenaean inscriptions composed about 1250 B.C., indicating that his cult was indigenous to Greece. The god’s name seems to include “Zeus” as its first element, but scholarly attempts to interpret Dionysus as meaning “son of Zeus” have not been widely accepted. Because the infant Dionysus was, for a time, raised by nymphs living on Mount Nysa (location unknown), some historians suggest that the name may mean “Zeus of Nysa.” Dionysus is commonly identified with other male fertility gods of the ancient Near East, including the Mesopotamian and Syrian Tammuz (Dumuzi), whose name means “proper son,” the true offspring of divinity; the Near Eastern Adonis (a Semitic term meaning “lord,” or “master”); and the Egyptian Osiris, who is dis- membered by his jealous brother Set, reassembled by his devoted sister-wife Isis, and subsequently resurrected as ruler of the Land of the Dead. All of these youthful fig- ures have similar stories: they undergo a violent death — typically by being torn asun- der— descend into the Underworld, and are ultimately reborn as immortal beings. Myths about Dionysus’s entrance into Greece reflect the Greeks’ deep ambivalence about this troubling god who provides freedom from everyday reality but stimulates potentially antisocial conduct as well. The most common tradition presents him as"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"Dionysus 231 FIGURE 8-4 The Birth of Dionysus. Surrounded by figures associated with his ecstatic cult, the infant Dionysus emerges from his father’s thigh. The second (and last) of Zeus’s children to be born from their fa- ther’s body, Dionysus repre- sents the ever-changing natural world and the in- stinctual component of the human psyche, a counter- balance to Athene’s con- scious intellect. As their respective birth myths suggest, Athene and Dionysus demonstrate that reason and irrationality spring from the same powerful source. (Museo Archeologico Nazionale, Taranto) both native born and the proselytizer of a strange foreign cult. In Euripides’ play the Bacchae (the title refers to female devotees of Bacchus [BAFi-kuhs], another name for Dionysus), the god returns to Thebes, site of his initial birth, from Asia Minor, where he has recruited a throng of enthusiastic female worshipers (Figure 8-3). Suspicious of its “un-Greek” excesses, the Theban King Pentheus (Dionysus’s own cousin) bans the new religion and imprisons the god (disguised as a gentle youth), who then exacts a savage vengeance on the entire city (see Chapter 13, the Bacchae). Dionysus’s Double Birth As she tried to prevent Leto from delivering Apollo and Artemis, Fiera also does her best to keep Dionysus from being born. Determined to thwart Zeus’s efforts to popu- late Olympus with children who are not her offspring, Hera disguises herself as a harmless old lady and appears to Semele (a daughter of Cadmus, king of Thebes), whom Zeus has seduced, and convinces the naive princess that the mysterious lover who visits her under cover of darkness is actually an ogre. Following Hera’s instruc- tions, Semele makes her paramour—Zeus in human form—promise to grant what- ever she asks: she then demands that her lover appear as he really is. Despite Zeus’s attempts to dissuade her, Semele insists that he keep his vow, compelling Zeus to reveal his essential force, a blaze of lightning that incinerates the young woman. From her flaming corpse, Zeus snatches the embryo of Dionysus, which he places in his thigh until the child is fully formed. After several months, as if to spite Hera again (she never forgives Athene’s motherless entrance into the world), from his own body Zeus gives birth to Dionysus, who is thus a god twice-born (Figure 8-4). Unlike Athene, who springs from Zeus’s brain, Dionysus issues from his father’s thigh, a male fertility god who represents the life force energizing plants, animals, and human beings. In the poet Dylan Thomas’s phrase, he is “the force that through the green fuse drives the flower.” Dionysus’s nature is extremely varied and complex, but among other things he is god of the vine, a deity representing the growth, death, and rebirth of vegetation.

The only major Olym- pian born from the union of Zeus with a mortal woman, Dionysus is also the only deity who under- goes sparagmos (the physical tear- ing asunder of a young male) and rebirth, an aspect of his myth that links him with the mysteries of the natural life cycle. In this vase painting, a bearded Dionysus, draped in leopard skins, contem- plates the slim figure of a youth holding the wine god’s identifying emblems: a wine cup and a grape- vine. In beholding his youthful image, a renewal of self symbol- ized by the flourishing vine, the mature Dionysus comprehends both psychological and physical transformation, the strange pro- cess by which nature re-creates life. In the Orphic religion, Dio- nysus’s descent to and return from the Underworld foreshad- ows the human soul’s quest for immortality. (Museo Archeologico Nazionale, Ferrara) stimulates earth to produce grain and whose absence brings winter’s sterility, Diony- sus symbolizes the annual vegetative cycle. His chief gift to humanity is the fruit of the vine—wine that gladdens the hearts of all, from peasant laborers toiling in vine- yards to carefree gods feasting on Olympus. Like the paradoxical god himself, Dionysus’s intoxicating gift is double-edged: wine can temporarily ease anxiety and heighten the capacity for pleasure, but its effects can also induce severe mental disorientation, followed by debilitating ill- ness. As one of the world’s first mood-altering beverages, wine triggers the rapid changes in personality and behavior that typify Dionysus’s protean character (Fig- ure 8-5). As a god of fluids—wine, blood, sap, and semen—he undergoes sudden transformations of mood and physical shape, appearing one moment as a seductive adolescent offering a brimming chalice of wine and the next as a savage bull ready to gore any offender. Greek vase painters, who decorated wine vats, mixing bowls, and drinking cups with scenes from Dionysian myth, commonly showed the god as a handsome youth casually lounging in a chariot bedecked with vine branches and ivy and drawn by panthers or leopards—feline predators ready to tear flesh at the slightest provocation."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"Dionysus 233 Dionysus’s Youth and Foreign Travels Myths about Dionysus’s early career are many and diverse. Although the following summary draws on a wide variety of sources originating at different periods of Greek history, two main themes consistently dominate the disparate narratives: the god rep- resents strange foreign customs, and he repeatedly confronts opponents hostile to him and his religion. His first enemy is his father’s wife. Showing the same malice that motivated her persecution of Leto and Heracles, Hera pursues the infant Dio- nysus, punishing all who try to help Semele’s son. After Hermes takes the child to Semele’s sister, Ino, who disguises him as a girl, Hera falls on Dionysus’s protectors, driving both Ino and her husband. King Athamas, mad (Figure 8-6). This time Zeus transports Dionysus far from Greece, changing his son into a young goat and hiding him on Mount Nysa, where nymphs tenderly care for the child. Dionysus’s discovery of wine, his chief contribution to humanity, also involves his initiation into the mysteries of love and death. The young god’s first lover is Ampelus, a youth who is gored to death by an enraged bull. When he discovers Ampelus’s bloodied corpse lying in the dust, Dionysus, who has never known sorrow before, weeps unashamedly. Watered by divine tears, Ampelus’s body shoots forth a vine that bears ruddy fruit, its color reflecting the boy’s rosy complexion. Just as Apollo’s grief transformed Hyacinthus into a fragrant symbol of perishable beauty, so Dionysus re- creates Ampelus as a plant whose grape clusters, properly fermented, induce in par- takers the same intoxicating joy that his first love gave to the wine god. Demeter’s bread and Athene’s olive were necessary for existence, but Dionysus’s beverage sur- passed other divine gifts in liberating the human spirit. The first person to whom Dionysus teaches the art of making wine is Icarius, an old gardener who hospitably receives the god when he appears as a human stranger. Obedient to the god’s command, Icarius then travels around the countryside, supply- ing wine to the thirsty and instructing farmers in viniculture. When some shepherds overindulge and think that they have been poisoned, they murder Icarius, who is dressed in the skin of a goat he had killed earlier for eating his grapevines. According to one tradition, it was then that men first danced around a slain goat, a performance that allegedly developed into the choral “goat song” of tragedy (see Chapter 13). Observing Dionysus’s vulnerability after the death of Ampelus, Hera seizes the opportunity to afflict him with insanity, compelling him to wander crazily through Egypt, Syria, and Asia Minor. (The inexperienced young god’s erratic behavior may also have resulted from an overfondness for his own inebriating invention.) Eventually regaining his sanity, Dionysus continues to roam the earth, acquiring some attributes of foreign deities and punishing those who fail to honor him. When in Phrygia (a region in modern Turkey), Dionysus is initiated into the orgiastic rites of Cybele [SIB-e-lee], an eastern fertility goddess whom the Greeks commonly iden- tified with Rhea, mother of the Olympians. Dionysus next travels to Thrace, where King Lycurgus foolishly attempts to imprison him. After afflicting the king with madness and rendering his entire land barren, Dionysus then orders Lycurgus tied to four horses, which bolt in four different directions, ripping the king’s body apart. According to another version of Lycurgus’s story, after Dionysus drives the king to kill his son, Dryas, Lycurgus is eaten alive by wild horses.

In this bucolic scene, Ino gives the child a drink from the Horn of Plenty while sheep graze peacefully and a boy satyr plays the syrinx (a multireed instrument invented by Pan or, in some accounts, by his father, Hermes).

The animal most closely associated with Dionysus’s revels, the goat is not only the god’s preferred sacrificial offering but also the form in which Dionysus customarily appears to his followers. Called fauns by the Romans, satyrs are famous for their sexual prowess, which artists typically emphasize by depicting them with oversized (and fully erect) penises. Symbols of unrestrained male libido, they are unabashedly lecherous, spending much of their time drinking wine and/or pursuing wood nymphs or other young men (Figures 8-8 and 8-9). Whereas satyrs are generally youthful, the similarly human- animal hybrids known as silens are usually pictured as old men whose bestial appear- ance and antic behavior belie their inner wisdom. By about the sixth century B.C., writers and artists amalgamated the concepts of satyrs and silens, using the terms interchangeably to denote virtually identical members of Dionysus’s sacred band. Possessed by the god’s frenzied spirit, many women also join the retinue: these bacchants (also called bacchae) reveal their oneness with nature by dressing in tiger or fawn skins and bedecking themselves with vine leaves and ivy (Figure 8-10). Mae- nads [MEE-nadz], literally “mad women,” were inspired with Dionysian mania to leave their cities and gather by night in rugged mountains, where, through ritual singing and dancing, they achieved religious ecstacy (Figure 8-11). Dionysus Zagreus Beginning in the sixth century B.C., some Greek writers forged an association between the myth of Dionysus and that of Orpheus, the poet who had descended into the Un- derworld to bring back his deceased wife, Eurydice (see Chapter 9). An esoteric tradi- tion known as Orphism, allegedly based on Orpheus’s secret teachings, promoted a variation of the Dionysian myth that offered a different version of his double birth and that linked the wine god more closely with the regenerative powers of the Underworld. According to Orphic teaching, Dionysus is originally the son of Zeus and Persephone. Zeus plans to enthrone his divine son, who combines his celestial power with chthonic wisdom, as king of the universe.

Zeus punishes the Titans by striking them with lightning, carbonizing the giant cannibals who dared to kill the son of god. Orphic religion taught that the human race sprang from the Titans’ ashes, which accounted for humanity’s dual nature (Fig- ure 8-12): human beings were rebels against the gods, but they also contained ele- ments of the divine, the flesh of Zeus’s son that the Titans had consumed. Although imbued with evil impulses (the Titan heritage), humanity was also infused with a spark of divinity (Dionysus’s body). Because they housed a “god within,” humans could be awakened to their divine potential.

When he asks directions from a young man named Prosymnus (or Polymnus), the youth agrees to reveal the path if Dionysus will have sex with him on his return. After ascending from the nether regions, Dionysus finds that Prosymnus has died during his absence. Resolved to keep his promise, however, Dionysus fashions a stick into an appropriately phallic shape, plants it on Prosymnus’s grave, and performs the desired sexual act. Athens’s annual festival honoring the god, the City Dionysia, featured an elaborate procession in which participants carried a statue of Dionysus and replicas of his sacred phallus (symbol of divine virility). The secret rituals through which worshipers were initiated into the Dionysian cult also included a climactic unveiling of an oversized model of the god’s penis. Erotic and fertility motifs in the Dionysian cult persisted well into Roman times. Wall paintings in the famous Villa of the Mysteries near Pompeii (buried by an erup- tion of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79) depict a variety of scenes from the Dionysian initiation ceremonies (Figure 8-13). Providing a warmer emotional climate than that offered by the distant Olympians, the Dionysian Mysteries were extremely popular throughout Greece and Italy. Al- though Rome’s senate banned the Bacchanalia in 186 B.C., the wine god’s rites con- tinued to be observed well into the Christian era. The religion ascribed to Orpheus mediated between the orgiastic passion of Dio- nysus and the austere control of Apollo, suggesting the essential unity of these osten- sibly antithetical deities. Promoting a balance between emotion and intellect, as well as strict personal ethics and thoughtful preparation for the next life, Orphism antici- pated many of the doctrines of Christianity.

In the Homeric epics, Hades' subterranean domain is locatedfar to the north, be- yond the River of Ocean that encircles the earth's central landmass. The Odyssey pictures Hades' realm, eternally dark and cheerless, as the perma- nent prison of dlmosx. all dead souls; only a few of Zeus's favorites are sent to the Isles of the Blest (also called Elysium), an earthlike paradise. As Greek concepts of individual responsibility developed over time, however, many poets and philosophers argued that a person's behavior in this life de- termined one's fate after death. After the sixth century B.C., the old Ho- meric view of Hades' realm was typically modified to accommodate all righteous souls in Elysium, with the wicked atoning for their crimes in Tar- tarus. In his speculations about the soul's posthumous fate, Plato (c. 427— 347 B.c.) employs Orphic teachings symbolically to create a vision of the afterlife based on ethical justice. Plato's interpretation of myths about the next worldforms an indispensable link between the Homeric view of Hades (^Odyssey, Book 11) and that pictured, seven centuries later, in Virgil's Aeneid (Book 6), which incorporates many Platonic ideas and themes. The Homeric View of the Afterlife The Greeks expressed their desire for perpetual youth, beauty, and everlasting life in myths about the gods. By contrast, myths about their heroes revealed a painful aware- ness of the limits that death imposes on all human striving. The Greek hero’s passion 247"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"248 The Myth ic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes to seize every opportunity for fame and individual achievement springs largely from his certainty that every quality he values—strength, good looks, even divine favor— will inevitably be taken from him. The tension between life’s unrealized possibilities and the prospect of imminent oblivion in Hades’ kingdom casts a chilling shadow across the mythic landscape. Although Greek and Roman ideas about the afterlife changed over time, eventu- ally incorporating diverse views of the next world, the Homeric epics provide the earliest—and most influential—vision of Hades’ realm. In the Odyssey, Homer em- phasizes the extreme dread with which his heroes regard the Underworld. When Circe, a wise enchantress, informs Odysseus that he must travel into Hades’ realm— in effect, to die before his time—the hero feels his heart shatter within him {Odyssey, Books 9 and 11). Far from being an escape from earthly woes into a higher realm of light and beauty, death signified only one thing: permanent imprisonment in a dark world utterly devoid of joy, purpose, or hope. In journeying to Hades’ realm, Odys- seus is forced to confront both the fact of his own mortality and the unspeakable bleakness of the soul’s vague and unsatisfying half-life in the netherworld. The ghost of Achilles, once the Greeks’ most vital and enviable hero, hastens to assure Odysseus that he would rather be a poor man’s living slave than king of all the dead. Writing in the sixth century B.C., the lyric poet Anacreon contemplated his own fear of death with similar pessimism: for the lightless chasm of death is dreadful and the descent appalling: once cast down into [Hades], there is no return. —Greek Lyric Poetry, trans. Willis Barnstone, p. 127 The Homeric picture of Hades’ dominion underscores both the finality of death and the impossibility of any satisfying contact between the living and the dead. Illus- trating the unbridgeable gap between the two, Homer describes Odysseus reaching out to embrace the shade (disembodied spirit) of his mother, Anticleia, only to find that he can no more grasp her shadowy form than he can hold a puff of smoke. Death, personified as Thanatos [THAN-a-tohs], severs even the closest ties of kin- ship and affection. While depriving the soul of substance, death simultaneously impairs memory, rea- son, and will. The throng of souls that gather near Odysseus are witless, gibbering specters until they are allowed to drink sacrificial blood, which temporarily restores their mental faculties and ability to speak. Following Circe’s instructions, Odysseus performs an elaborate chthonic ritual intended to summon the dead and briefly es- tablish communication with them. The long trench he digs functions as both a sym- bolic grave and a boundary separating the realms of life and death, a frontier that neither the living nor the dead may cross. Into the trench Odysseus pours a mixed libation (ceremonial drink offering) representing the earth’s bounty, such as honey, grain, and wine, as well as the blood of black rams, animals peculiarly sacred to Hades. A belief that blood is the essence of life was widespread in the ancient world. As the Book of Leviticus declares, “The life of the soul [living creature] is in the blood.” Dead souls hunger for it. The first soul whom Odysseus encounters is that of Elpenor, one of his men who had recently been killed by falling off Circe’s roof. Elpenor begs Odysseus to give him"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"Land of No Return 249 a proper burial, without which no soul can find peace (see Figure 12-8). So important was the Greek conviction that funeral ceremonies were indispensable in securing posthumous rest, that Oedipus’s daughter Antigone will risk her life to perform final rites for her brother Polyneices (see Chapter 16). This obligation to the dead also spurs Priam, king of Troy, to brave Achilles’ wrath to retrieve the body of his son Hector (see Chapter 11). Survival through Descendants Although the Homeric Hades offers a bleak picture of the soul’s condition after death, it also includes a slightly more positive element—the belief that one may live on through one’s descendants and that their accomplishments may somehow enhance one’s own postmortem existence. After informing Odysseus that he would rather be alive as a pauper’s slave than the most envied soul in Hades’ kingdom, Achilles rejoices in Odysseus’s news that Neoptolemus, Achilles’ warrior son, has won univer- sal admiration for his courage and skill in battle. Buoyed by this revelation of his progeny’s fame, Achilles strides proudly away across the Plain of Asphodel (a dreary region dotted with funereal plants related to the iris family), the only soul in the Homeric netherworld to manifest any degree of joy. The Location and Geography of Hades’ Realm In Homer’s account, Odysseus reaches Hades by sailing northward across the River of Ocean, earth’s far boundary where sky’s vault touches the ground and the sun sinks into darkness. Odysseus’s journey to the land of the dead, traversing a foggy, desolate waste, roughly parallels that of Gilgamesh to the faraway island retreat of the Sume- rian king’s immortal ancestor Utnapishtim. The Homeric concept of the afterlife, in fact, strikingly resembles older Mesopotamian beliefs about the Underworld: the ghost of Enkidu informs his friend Gilgamesh that departed souls mourn forever in a mildew- and worm-infested dungeon. The Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) paints a similarly grim picture: all the dead, both good and bad, are permanently housed in an underground region called Sheol, a Hebrew counterpart of the Homeric Hades. Reduced to impotent shadows or wraiths (called repaim), the dead languish in mindless inactivity. As if he were para- phrasing Achilles’ pessimism, the author of Ecclesiastes argues that it is better to be a “live dog” than a “dead lion,” “because in Sheol [Hades], for which you are bound, there is neither doing nor thinking, neither understanding nor wisdom” (Eccles. 9:5, 10). Over the centuries, numerous poets contributed to myths about Hades, providing more detailed aspects of its topography. Five great subterranean rivers were said to encompass or flow through the Underworld: the Styx (Abhorent) is Hades’ principal stream, personified by a river goddess, a daughter of Ocean, who sided with Zeus in his battle with the Titans. As a result, Zeus honored her by decreeing that an oath invoking the Styx was inviolable, even by the gods. The Acheron [AK-e-rahn] (Dis- tress), like the Styx, is commonly represented as Hades’ official boundary across which all souls pass on the way to their allotted places below. Cocytus [koh-SYE-tuhs] (Eament), variously defined as a branch of the Acheron or Styx, and Phlegethon or Pyriphlegethon (Fire Flaming) are the two other rivers"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"250 The Mythic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes Greek myth placed in Hades. In Plato’s “Myth of Er,” a mystical vision of the after- life that concludes his Republic, the philosopher adds a “river of unmindfulness” that runs through a plain named Lethe. Roman poets later made Lethe [LEE-thee] (Oblivion) the name of Hades’ fifth river. Drinking Lethe’s waters caused souls about to be reincarnated in new bodies to forget their past lives and sufferings (see Chapter 19, Virgil’s Aeneid). The Christian poet Dante borrowed the four Greek rivers to intersect his Inferno and relocated Lethe atop the Mount of Purgatory so that purified souls could drink its waters to erase all memory of sin before ascending to heaven. Elysium In the Odyssey, Homer briefly refers to Elysium [e-LIZ-ih-uhm], garden islands of earthly delights located far to the west at the extreme edge of the world, an Eden to which Zeus sends a very few of his particular favorites. Homer cites Menelaus as one of the isles’ future inhabitants, not because Agamemnon’s brother is virtuous, but because he is married to Helen, the beautiful daughter that Zeus, in the shape of a swan, had sired by Leda. This mythic paradise, which was later also known as the Elysian Fields, echoes the Mesopotamian myth of Dilmun, an Edenic island where some heroic souls could posthumously continue to enjoy life’s sensual pleasures. Residents of Hades’ Domain Hades, also called Aidoneus, the “invisible” or “unseen one,” represents the univer- sality of death’s hold on humanity. His queen, Persephone, whom the Homeric Hymn to Demeter originally associates with flowers and other emblems of youthful beauty (see Chapter 4), comes to share her husband’s pitilessness (Figure 9-1). Enforcing death’s utter finality, the couple permits no one (except a few heroes) to escape Hades’ confines. The rare myths in which the two rulers allow a shade to return to earth, as when the poet Orpheus persuades them to release his beloved wife, Eurydice, only serve to highlight the bitter inevitability of loss (see Ovid’s “Orpheus and Eurydice” in Chapter 20). Besides reflecting the natural law condemning all that lives to perish, the Kingdom of Hades also encompasses childlike fears of monsters and other bogeymen that lurk in the dark. Cerberus [SER-ber-uhs], the hound of hell, is a three-headed (or fifty- headed) dog with a mane (or tail) of snakes who guards the Underworld’s entrance. The Furies (Erinyes), generated from the blood of Uranus’s castration, have their home here, as does, in later myth, Eurynomos [oo-RIH-noh-mohs], a demonic fig- ure associated with death and decay. Even more images of pain and terror appear in the nightmare abyss of Tartarus (discussed in the next section). In contrast to Homer, who represented the dead as being admitted directly to the Plain of Asphodel, later mythographers emphasized the soul’s symbolic crossing of Hades’ watery frontier. Charon [KA-rohn], a hideous creature whose job is to ferry souls across the Styx or Acheron, demands a monetary fee for his services (Fig- ure 9-2).

This vase painting shows Hades and Persephone, King and Queen of the Underworld, in a pose typical of Greek domestic life, as if they were an ordinary couple. The implications of Hades’ extending a bowl toward his wife, as if invit- ing her to partake, are paradoxical: because Demeter’s inexperienced daughter accepted hospi- tality— in the form of pomegranate seeds (the symbol of marriage)—from Hades, she was forced to remain in his gloomy kingdom for part of each year (see Chapter 4).

As originally conceived, these magistrates function primarily to assign souls their respec- tive positions in Hades’ domain or to arbitrate their futile quarrels. In later times, when writers began to distinguish between the respective fates of good and evil per- sons, Minos and Rhadamanthus determined whether a soul enjoyed the bliss of Ely- sium or the agony of Tartarus. Thanatos’s (Death’s) twin brother Hypnos (Sleep) also inhabits the Underworld. A fatherless child of Night, he is commonly depicted as a winged youth who pours soporific liquid from a horn or gently touches the weary with a branch. Generally regarded as friendly toward humans, Hypnos appears in Greek funerary art as a kindly figure helping to carry souls of the recently dead to the next world (Fig- ure 9-3).

A giant son of Gaea, Tityus attempted to rape Leto, the mother of Apollo and Artemis. For this sacrilege, he is punished by being spread-eagled on the ground and having two vultures continually feed on his liver (then believed to be the locus of sexual passion). His punishment, identical to that of Prometheus, is also an emasculation, a stripping of power and virility from one who impiously tried to compete with Zeus.

Because the ancient Greeks believed that Charon demanded a fee for his services, corpses were commonly buried or cremated with a coin in their mouths. Shades (disembodied spirits) without the necessary payment—or those whose bodies had not been properly buried—were denied passage, preventing them from finding peace in the neth- erworld.

Experiencing insatiable desire that is eternally unsatisfied, Tantalus lends his name to the English verb tantalize (which means “to tease or frustrate by appearing to promise something that is never given”). Myth gives several different accounts of Tantalus’ crime. In one version, Tantalus, living at the dawn of time when humans dined with gods, abused Olympian hospi- tality by stealing ambrosia and giving it to undeserving mortals. In another account, Tantalus irresponsibly divulged secrets gleaned from divine tabletalk. In the most common variant, Tantalus is said to have tested divine omniscience by serving the gods the flesh of his son Pelops [PEE-lahps]. Only Demeter, distracted by her grief for Persephone, ate part of Pelops’s body (his shoulder), which Zeus replaced with gleaming ivory when he restored the boy to life. In this version of the myth, Tantalus, for his sin of cannibalism, must suffer from a ravenous appetite that is never satisfied."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"Land of No Return 255 FIGURE 9-5 Sisyphus in Tartarus. In Book 11 of the Odyssey, Homer describes the post- mortem torments of a few souls who have directly offended the gods. The reputed founder of Corinth, Sisyphus was notorious for his cunning, which included a successful plot to outwit Death and live to a ripe old age. When he finally dies, however, the gods condemn him to push a huge boulder uphill, only to have it roll down again just before he reaches the top. This exercise in obsessive futility illustrates the gods’ harsh treatment of those who attempt to thwart natural law: human ingenuity can no more forestall death than a falling boulder can escape the force of gravity. (Vatican Museums, Rome) making him a prime example of the gods’ retributive justice. Odysseus also sees Sisyphus [SIS-ih-fuhs] (reputed founder of the city of Cor- inth), who is forced to roll a huge stone uphill, only to have it roll back again, so that he must endlessly repeat a painfully strenuous but meaningless act (Figure 9-5). Like Tityus and Tantalus, Sisyphus was a trickster who tried to dupe or outwit the gods. When Sisyphus was alive, he betrayed Zeus by revealing one of his seductions, pro- voking the Olympian to send Thanatos (Death) to haul him off to Hades. Sisyphus, however, succeeded in overpowering Thanatos and chaining him so that mortals ceased to die. After Ares released Thanatos, Sisyphus was dragged into the Under- world, but not before he instructed his wife not to bury his body but to leave it in the street. His powers of deception undiminished, Sisyphus next persuaded Hades and Persephone to permit him to return to earth to punish his negligent wife. As soon as he arrived aboveground, Sisyphus refused to return, frustrating death by liv- ing to a ripe old age. The gods, of course, have the last laugh, ingeniously devising a torment that mocks his ephemeral victory over Thanatos. A fourth notorious sinner, Ixion, dared to assault Hera, as if to take Zeus’s place in heaven.

(British Museum, London) later myth, the ordinary inhabitant of Tartarus is a human soul, sent thence to be purged of the qualities that spawned evil deeds or, in some extreme cases, to endure eternal punishment. Descents into the Underworld In Greco-Roman myth, only a tiny handful of the most esteemed heroes succeed in reaching—and returning alive from—the House of Hades. In virtually every case, tales of a descent into the netherworld (katabasis) form one episode in a long chain of events involving the hero’s learning to overcome fear and endure pain. Odysseus and Heracles are both famous for undergoing trials that severely test their courage and resourcefulness. Confronting the ultimate challenge—death’s negation of all hu- man achievement—not only places the hero’s life in perspective but also enables him to experience symbolic annihilation and rebirth. Odysseus and Aeneas (a Trojan prince), in particular, emerge from Hades’ realm with a renewed sense of purpose that allows them either to reclaim a patrimony (Odysseus) or to found a new home- land (Aeneas), thus successfully completing their predestined lifework.

Love (Eros) is also the force that motivates Orpheus, the first musi- cian and poet, to rescue his dead wife, Eurydice, from Hades’ prison. It is also a form of love that drives Dionysus, then still mortal, to retrieve his mother, Semele, from Hades (see Chapter 8). The Descent of Heracles Odysseus’s last conversation in the Underworld is with Heracles, the strongest, brav- est, and longest-suffering of all Greek heroes. Although hailing Odysseus as a fellow hero, Heracles pointedly reminds him that in life he (Heracles) had already accom- plished a much more difficult descent. The last of Heracles’ Twelve Labors requires him to kidnap Cerberus (Figure 9-7) and exhibit the hellhound to his cowardly mas- ter, Eurystheus. Like Odysseus, before his journey Heracles sought the guidance of an earth-goddess figure and was initiated into the Mysteries of Demeter at Eleusis, where he was taught the means of safely traversing Death’s kingdom (see Chapter 10)."},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"258 The Mythic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes Although most traditions state categorically that no Olympian ever sets foot in Hades, in the Heracles myth both Athene and Hermes (Victorious Wisdom and Safe Travel) act as his guides. As Psychopompos (Guide of Souls), Hermes normally with- draws to Olympus immediately after depositing souls at Hades’ portals. According to Apollodorus, however, on this occasion he remains at Heracles’ side, reminding him that the monsters he encounters, such as the Gorgon Medusa, are shadows cast by his own fears. With divinely inspired courage, Heracles dares to face Hades (Pluto) himself, winning the implacable god’s permission to take Gerberus—on the condi- tion that he use none of his usual weapons. Heracles not only performs unprecedented feats of strength, such as capturing Cerberus with his bare hands, but also exercises his equally notable sense of compas- sion in freeing several heroes from Hades’ prison. Besides rescuing Theseus (see the next section), he releases Apollo’s son, Asclepius, allowing the master physician’s heal- ing influence again to benefit humanity at such shrines as Epidaurus. Although he escapes Hades with Cerberus in tow, Heracles must obey universal law in returning there after his death. As Homer observes, however, Heracles differs from all other Underworld inhabitants; his image remains below, but his real self, or soul, ascends to join his father and other gods on Mount Olympus. Homer does not pursue the implications of Heracles’ dual nature, his paradoxical sharing of both human death and Olympian immortality. By placing Heracles’ appearance last in Odysseus’s Underworld experience, however, Homer indirectly anticipates later philosophic speculations about humanity’s duality—its division into a perishable body and deathless spirit—views that shape later Orphic and Platonic concepts of the virtuous soul’s posthumous reward in Elysium. The Descent of Theseus Theseus, a legendary king of Athens who supposedly lived in Minoan times, is the rare example of a hero who dared to enter Hades’ kingdom with unworthy motives— and with disastrous consequences. The Athenian hero, whose father was Poseidon, was the devoted friend of Pirithous [pye-RITH-oh-uhs], a mortal son of Zeus. Be- cause they were both the offspring of gods, they decided that only daughters of Zeus would make acceptable wives. After abducting Helen from Sparta and finding that she was too young to marry, Theseus and Pirithous descended into Hades’ realm for the purpose of kidnaping Persephone. While in the Underworld searching for its queen, the heroes accepted an invitation to dine with Hades, who lived up to his reputation as a host who makes all visitors permanently welcome. Seated at the ban- quet, they found that they were immobilized in their chairs, unable to rise. Not until Heracles arrived in the netherworld was Theseus released, and then he lost part of his buttocks when Heracles literally tore him from his seat, a crude surgery that reputedly accounted for the subsequent prevalence of slim hips among Athenian youths. The- seus’s tragedy is that he returned to life without the person he loved best: the gods denied Pirithous permission to leave, imprisoning him forever in the chair of oblivion. Like Gilgamesh and Achilles, Theseus was deprived of his alter ego, con- demned to exist without his beloved companion whose presence had alone given meaning to heroic adventure."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"Land of No Return 259 FIGURE 9-8 Orpheus Charming Wild Beasts with His Singing. A personification of musical skill, Orpheus was the world’s most effective, if not its first, poet. Ac- companying his singing on the lyre, he charmed the gods, reduced wild animals to peaceful contemplation (as shown in this Roman mosaic), and even persuaded Hades and Persephone to release his be- loved Eurydice from the confines of death. Orpheus’s ability to create beauty and tame animal instincts, as well as his de- scent into the Underworld, made him the subject of a religious cult, Orphism, that initiated converts into the rites and purifi- cations necessary to achieve happiness in the afterlife. (National Museum, Palermo) The Descent of Orpheus The descent myth that has had the most enduring influence—commemorated for millennia in Western art, religion, and philosophy—is that of Orpheus [OR-fee- uhs], who entered Hades’ realm to retrieve his adored wife, Eurydice [oo-RIH-dih- see], who had died of a poisonous snakebite. A mortal figure who combines elements of rational Apollo and ecstatic Dionysus, Orpheus is the archetypal creative artist, expressing powerful emotions in poetry of irresistible beauty. Wflien Orpheus per- forms on his lyre, given him by Apollo, the entire world is captivated by his song: gods, mortals, wild animals, and even stones respond joyously (Figure 9-8). In the still darkness of death’s lair, Orpheus’s music charms Hades’ fiercest monsters, includ- ing Cerberus and the Furies, who quietly let him pass. Singing of his love for Eu- rydice, Orpheus reduces Hades and Persephone to tears, winning their permission to take back his wife—provided he does not look at or speak to her until after they have emerged into the world of light. Orpheus’s fatal error is as inevitable as Adam’s tasting the forbidden fruit or Pan- dora’s opening the jar of woes. His loss of Eurydice is final (Figure 9-9) and poi- gnantly illustrates the Greeks’ realistic assessment of such romantic notions as Love (Eros) having the power to overcome Death (Thanatos). Although Orpheus is primarily identified with Apollo’s lucidity and musicality, his story after losing Eurydice parallels events in Dionysus’s myth, including a violent death by sparagmos and eventual deification. According to one tradition, after dis- covering how cruelly the universe fails to honor or protect married love, Orpheus renounces women and devotes himself to winning the young men of Thrace, who flock to hear him play (see Figure 13-7).

Because he had penetrated the mysteries of the Underworld and overcome its terrors, Orpheus was regarded as a source of esoteric knowledge about the afterlife. A whole body of poems and hymns, known as the Orphic literature, was (falsely) as- cribed to him, including mythological texts about the world’s origins and about Dio- nysus’s rebirth after the Titans had dismembered and eaten him (see Chapter 8). Orphic poetry not only influenced Dionysian mystery cults but also promised initi- ates help after death, offering magic spells, secret passwords, and ritual practices that enabled newly deceased souls to find safe passage through Hades’ dangerous paths. Persons initiated into these mysteries were sometimes buried with gold leaves in- scribed with the formulae necessary to answer correctly when brought before an underworld tribunal over which Persephone, queen of the nether region, presided. Most modern scholars believe that Orphism was less a formal religion than a highly diverse set of occult beliefs and practices based on Orphic literature. In Orphic teaching, humankind, formed from the ashes of Titans who had murdered and con- sumed the young Dionysus, bore a collective guilt for this primal crime, a contami- nation that had to be cleansed through ritual purification. Paralleling the doctrines of the philosopher Pythagoras (sixth century B.C.), Orphism fostered a belief in metempsychosis—the doctrine that the soul underwent a series of rebirths in new bodies, pursuing a quest for spiritual cleansing that would eventually permit its escape from the wheel of reincarnation. In this view, the netherworld became a place of ultimate regeneration. Evolving Ideas about the Afterlife For all its gloom, even the Homeric Underworld depicts the human soul as too im- portant to suffer extinction at death, granting it a tenuous survival and some retention of individual identity. Hades is viewed as a Freudian or Jungian dreamlike state in which disembodied souls, like sleepers caught in a nightmare, experience a paralysis that renders them unable to control their actions or environment. Souls float help- lessly amid flickering shadows, insubstantial as clouds that dissolve and re-form with- out purpose or volition. For Homer, death is being trapped in a murky dreamland where the rational will loses all ability to make choices or influence events. Greek ideas about the afterlife, however, changed significantly over time. In Book 11 of Homer’s Odyssey, except for some notorious sinners, all of the dead are housed indiscriminately in a dank cave, with no hope of seeing light again. By contrast, in Book 6 of Virgil’s Aeneid, written approximately seven hundred years later, souls are assigned qualitatively different fates, with the virtuous enjoying a splendidly illumi- nated paradise and the wicked unspeakable torment. During the centuries between Homer and Virgil, Greek philosophers such as Pythagoras, Socrates, and Plato trans- formed beliefs about the spirit world, the nature of the human soul, and the ethical purpose of life."},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"262 The Myth ic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes The Transmigration of Souls Perhaps the first Greek thinker to articulate a doctrine about the soul’s transmigra- tion— that at death it passes into another earthly body—was Pythagoras (sixth cen- tury B.C.), a philosopher who established a school or society in Croton in southern Italy. Pythagoras’s contribution to Greek thought lies in two fields, mathematics and mysticism. In his scientific endeavors, he not only formulated the famous geometric theory named after him (involving the hypotenuse of a right triangle) but also discov- ered that the ratio of musical intervals produced by a vibrating string on a musical instrument can be expressed numerically. From this discovery, Pythagoras then ex- trapolated that the entire universe can be understood as a vast structure of numerical relationships. In his speculations about the soul, which he apparently conceived as a combina- tion of mind and life force, Pythagoras claimed to remember his previous incarna- tions. A legend in his own day, he was also said to hear the music of the spheres, the tones produced as the planets followed their orbits in heaven. Among the many sub- sequent thinkers inspired by Pythagoreanism was Empedocles (c. 492-432 B.C.), a poet and philosopher from Sicily. According to Empedocles, who allegedly recalled having been a shrub, a fish, and a girl in previous incarnations, the soul passes through many physical forms during the various aeons-long cycles into which cosmic history is divided. The most complete discussions of the nature of the soul, its postmortem survival, and its rebirth in new bodies appear in the works of the Athenian philosopher Plato (427-347 B.C.; Figure 9-10). Profoundly influenced by Orphic tradition and the teachings of Pythagoras, Plato argued that the human soul is immortal, originating in heaven but descending to earth in a kind of fall from grace, where it is trapped in a physical body. In such dialogues as the Phaedo and the Phaedrus, he contends that the human being is a duality composed of an invisible, eternal soul and a perishable material body tied to the natural processes of change and death. Plato’s most detailed vision of the soul’s fate after death is contained in the “Myth of Er,” a narrative that concludes the Republic. An extended parable of eschatological justice, Plato’s myth draws heavily on Or- phic doctrines involving purification and regeneration. Er, who narrates the tale, is a soldier who is seemingly killed in battle and for ten days lies in a comatose state during which his soul leaves his body and journeys to a spiritual realm where the recently dead gather for judgment. In Er’s near-death experience, which strikingly resembles similar reports published in this century, he witnesses the mysterious pro- cess of reincarnation in which souls choose their new lives on earth. After spending their allotted time, either in heaven or a place of torment, souls reassemble at the plain or meadow where fates are decided. Some persons who have experienced a thousand years of bliss in heaven choose unwisely because they have been virtuous merely from habit, not from philosophic conviction. Others, having painfully learned the value of righteousness from having endured a millennium of punishment for previous misdeeds, select a worthy new life. Mythic characters appear to illustrate some principles that determine individual choices: Orpheus, disgusted with human love, decides to become a swan. Odysseus, weary of laboring for distinction, chooses to return as an ordinary obscure person. In Plato’s universe, the gods, symbols of"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"Land of No Return 263 FIGURE 9-10 Plato. One of the world’s most influential thinkers, Plato used myths from the Orphic tradition to provide symbols for his vision of the soul’s fate after death.

Plato’s contribution to myths about the netherworld forms an indispensable link connecting the Fflomeric view of Hades and the more sophisticated picture given in Virgil’s Aeneid (see Chapter 19). Virgil (70-19 B.C.) follows Plato not only in assum- ing an essential polarity in human nature—the body-soul dichotomy—but also in portraying an afterlife in which souls are spiritually cleansed before returning to earth in new bodies. Combining mystical and ethical values, Virgil paints a complex Hades that is compartmentalized into contrasting regions such as Elysium and Tartarus, each representing a positive or negative aspect of the human psyche. For Pythagoras, Plato, and Virgil, the next world ceases to be a land of no return, but becomes a gateway to the soul’s future growth and regeneration. Christianity, which inherited many of its concepts from Greco-Roman tradition, also contributed to the mythic theme of descent into the Underworld. According to the New Testament, after his crucifixion Jesus of Nazareth descended into Tartarus, preaching to spirits imprisoned in its darkness (1 Pet. 3:19; 2 Pet. 2:4). From these brief passages, a belief developed that Jesus entered the netherworld on Good Friday to rescue the souls of righteous persons who had died before he ascended and opened the way to heaven. In medieval theology, this doctrine was known as the harrowing of hell.

For the early heroes, that quest often ends in their achieving some form of divine status, whereas later he- roes have to settle for a reputation that endures, though they themselves can- not. Each hero, however, also has his own unique characteristics. Perseus, possibly the earliest of the heroes, is unusual in his positive relationships with women, both divine and human; other heroes, like Heracles, Theseus, and Jason, experience dijfculties in their dealings with women. In all the heroes after Perseus, we see an inner division, men pulled in two directions: toward the fulfillment of their godlike capacity to excel, on the one hand, and toward the expression of their instinctive savagery or violence, on the other. In other figures, like Phaethon, the reckless flight of the hero toward immortality is used to teach a lesson on the dangers of excessive ambition. The patterns of the heroines’ stories dijfer from those of the heroes. The most common type of heroine is the “pe feet” wife or mother of the hero, who serves him all her life and remains loyal even after his death. She may even, like Alcestis, ojfer to die for him. Other heroines, sometimes described as “helper maidens,” aid heroes in completing their journeys or fulfilling their tasks. When such heroines, like Ariadne, switch roles and become lov- ers ofithe heroes, however, they are often abandoned. Rejecting the role of victim, some heroines try to be heroes on the masculine model, attempting to outdo the heroes at their own game, as Clytemnestra does. But such 265"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"266 The Myth ic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes attempts to violate gender roles invariably either fail or are fatal to the heroine. Alternatively, still other heroines, like Iphigenia, embrace catas- trophe from the outset, entering the Underworld as brides of Death. The smallest but most impressive group of heroines combine the best elements of the other types and succeed in attaining their goals and relating to their hero-husbands or lovers. In rare instances, they may even, like Psyche, achieve immortality. The Heroic Pattern The adventures of the Greek heroes, like those of heroes everywhere, typically follow a traditional pattern. The hero is often born in an unusual (or unnatural) fashion and, as an infant, faces terrible danger, which, of course, he survives. He often dem- onstrates prodigious powers, even in childhood. On reaching adulthood, he craves adventure and, seeking to test his own powers, embarks on a quest or series of quests: a journey of discovery during which he will learn about himself, his society, and his universe. In the course of that quest, he is eventually isolated from his fellow humans and, all alone, must do battle with nightmarish creatures or monsters, usually including some in serpent or dragon form—all variants of the serpents of the ancient Goddess. Ultimately, he must confront the divine or cosmic powers themselves. His journey often culminates in a trip to the Underworld, from which he returns, bringing a new awareness of himself, his own limits, and his relationship to the forces that govern the universe. The hero’s trip to the Underworld has been interpreted as a descent into the “womb” of the earth goddess, connecting the masculine ego of the hero with the feminine principle; others see the trip as a descent into the unconscious. Thus, re- joining the animus with the anima, the hero’s psyche can be made whole. Addition- ally, by connecting with both upper and lower worlds, the hero participates in the cycle of life, death, and rebirth that the goddess religions once embraced. In the competitive, linear world of the sky gods, the hero, being merely mortal, is at a serious disadvantage: his quest to defy death, to achieve literal immortality, is doomed. But in descending to the Underworld, the hero recognizes the necessity of experiencing the whole cycle, however terrifying. Ascending once more to the upper world, he achieves spiritual rebirth. Unlike Dionysus, the “twice-born” god who descends into human incarnation in the womb of a human mother and is born again out of his divine parent, the human hero descends into the womb of the Goddess and reclaims his spiritual life, which is his link to the divine world.

Archetypal Events Anthropologists, folklorists, and other scholars have surveyed traditions about the hero figure in representative cultures of the world and have compiled lists of char- acteristics that typify the hero’s life. The following list is adapted from one pub- lished by the folklorist and mythographer Lord Raglan. 1. The hero’s mother is a royal virgin. 2. His father is a king. 3. The circumstances of his conception and birth are unusual, and 4. He is reputed to be the son of a god. 5. At birth, an attempt is made, often by his father or maternal grandfather, to kill him, but 6. He is spirited away, and 7. He is reared by foster-parents in a far country. 8. On reaching manhood, he returns or travels to his future kingdom. 9. He often makes a journey to the Underworld, or the shades of the dead may visit him. 10. After he triumphs over the king and/or a giant, dragon, or wild beast, 11. He marries a princess, often the daughter of his predecessor, and 12. He becomes king. 13. Eventually, he loses favor with the gods and/or his subjects, and 14. He meets a mysterious death. 15. His children do not succeed him. 16. His body is not buried, but 17. He has one or more holy sepulchres. Other mythographers find different patterns. Joseph Campbell describes the heroic pattern as a “monomyth”: 1. The hero is separated from his familiar surroundings and goes on a journey alone. 2. He undergoes a mysterious initiation, during which he grapples with super- natural powers and gains a new understanding of himself in relation to his community and to the gods. 3. He returns to share the new vision with his fellows."},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"268 The Myth ic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes Age of Heroes follows immediately on the Bronze and Silver Ages, and the implicit function of the hero is to redeem humanity, a process begun by Prometheus’s defiance of Zeus. Prometheus’s gifts to humankind of sacrifice and fire serve to reconnect this fallen world to the world of the gods, at least symbolically. Sacrifice restores a form of mediated communication with the gods—the communion established by the symbolic sharing of a meal; fire provides both the means to cook our food (and thus to obliterate the obvious signs of our penchant for violence—that, like animals, we kill to eat) and the means to create technology (to use fire to forge weapons, for example). The hero’s function, too, is redemptive: by his half-divine nature, his glo- rious deeds, and his relentless pursuit of immortality, the hero uplifts humanity from its dismal condition and reminds it of its godlike potential. Nevertheless, he remains half-human and must therefore die. For the hero, the final burden of his humanity is the necessity of confronting his own mortality. In the polarities of the hero’s experiences, nature and culture and the human and divine converge to produce a being who is contradictory in his very essence. Protesting this condition, the ancient Sumerian hero Gilgamesh asks of the sun god, “If this quest is not to be achieved, why did you create in me the irresistible urge to attempt it?” The hero of Greek mythology, from Heracles to Achilles and Odys- seus, is similarly trapped by his very nature into undertaking, and usually achieving, the impossible—paradoxically pursuing death in order to achieve immortality, a po- tentially tragic endeavor. The Isolation of the Hero At the same time, the more successful he is at reconnecting humanity, by example or imaginatively, with the divine realm, the more the hero constitutes, by his very na- ture, a potential threat or rival to the gods. It is no accident that heroes are typically objects of enmity of one deity or another. The divided nature of the hero also creates a psychological dilemma. In his linear drive to burst through the tantalizingly transparent ceiling of mortality, the hero figure is isolated by his own uniqueness: no one understands his compulsion toward excess. Culminating the process of individuation begun at creation, the hero is the ultimate unique individual. And yet he craves human companionship and love. For the ancient Sumerian hero Gilgamesh, the gods provided a companion, Enkidu, to ease his loneliness. But even Enkidu, while sharing Gilgamesh’s enormous courage and skill, fails to understand his friend’s determination to do combat with Humbaba, the terrifying deity of the forest. For Gilgamesh, the mere fact of mortality is enough to fuel the compulsion to achieve something extraordinary—or to die trying. The ultimate isolation of the hero figure is even more emphatically evident in his relationship with women. For such a hero, essentially a warrior, the female is at best a distraction and at worst a threat. The bonds of love, domestic contentment, and/or sexual indulgence are destructive to the heroic task. To succeed in his quest—to fulfill his godlike aspirations — the hero must eschew the banal comforts of ordinary life that would bind him to the earth to which his body will eventually be returned. Although there are exceptions, such as Odysseus (see Chapter 12), the hero must typically reject, tame, or even kill the women in his life, lest he be tamed (and thus psychologically destroyed) or killed by them. The enmity of Hera, goddess of mar- riage, likewise reflects this essential antagonism."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"Heroes and Heroines of Myth 269 The Hero and Society In his role as protector of society, the hero is also a divided being. Charged with defending civilization from rampaging beasts or monsters or human enemies who would destroy it and return humankind to the savage condition from which it has only barely emerged, the hero has unique gifts that allow him to excel at protecting human societies from threats to personal, economic, or cultural survival. In addition, by his exploits and travels, he adds to humanity’s body of knowledge, both geographic and historical: Gilgamesh, for example, brings back knowledge of the world before the Flood, recovering the prehistory of Uruk and recording it for future generations. The product, furthermore, of a newly urbanized civilization, the hero, whose explicit, “official” job is protecting his city, represents an emergent civilization’s self- consciousness, both of its pride in its own glorious achievements (the Epic of Gilga- mesh, for example, opens with extended praise for the awesome walls, temples, and gardens of Gilgamesh’s city, Uruk) and of its incipient awareness that the gains of civilization, however amazing, are dependent on human beings’ willingness to com- mit themselves to maintaining that civilization. But humans are all too capable of backsliding into savagery and losing ail they have gained. It is the hero who bears the burden of protecting his civilization, often on behalf of (or in place of) the kings who organize the armies or appoint the tasks. Paradoxically, the hero’s great warrior skills, his potential for violence, and his often impulsive nature put civilization at risk: when we first meet Gilgamesh, he’s causing havoc in Uruk, raping the women and distract- ing the men from their work. Similarly, the heroes in Hesiod’s Bronze Age are so violent that they destroy each other, and the men of the Age of Heroes, whose exploits are recounted in the myths, constitute a second attempt at redemption. The Hero as Centaur: Image of the Divided Self Though required for his martial skill and willingness to serve in times of war or other threat, the hero becomes, in times of peace, a danger to the civilization he is charged with protecting. Furthermore, by encouraging and rewarding his capacity for vio- lence when it serves our needs and then complaining about our inability to control him when he continues to act in the same fashion once the immediate threat is re- solved, humanity creates conflicting sets of demands that result in an inner division in the hero’s own nature. In that inner division, the hero resembles the centaur —a literally divided creature. Combining a human head and upper torso with a horse’s rear end, the centaurs— beings with a capacity for intelligence, knowledge, and wisdom but possessing vora- cious appetites and aggressive instincts—embody the best and worst of human potentialities, brains and brawn inextricably joined. Two stories about centaurs exemplify their inherent contradictions. In their usual manifestation, the centaurs embody animal nature, raw and unrestrained. They are said to eat uncooked food and are unable to control themselves when drinking wine: invited to the wedding of a Lapith princess, the centaurs characteristically get drunk and attempt to carry off and rape the Lapith women.

Tales about Gilgamesh, a legendary king of Uruk, one of Mesopotamia’s first city-states, were composed in Sumeria as early as the second millennium B.c. The most complete version of his story, however, was compiled by the poet Sin-leqe-unnini in about the seventh century B.c. Although once widely distributed throughout the Near East (fragments have been found from Iraq to Israel), the epic was unknown to the modern world until the mid-nineteenth cen- tury. While excavating Nineveh, the ancient capital of Assyria, in the 1850s, ar- chaeologists discovered a royal library consisting of thousands of baked clay tablets inscribed in cuneiform, the wedge-shaped writing that the Sumerians had invented about 3200 B.C. Although partly damaged, the Nineveh library’s twelve tablets con- taining the Gilgamesh epic, supplemented by fragments from other sources, reveal a hero who strikingly anticipates major figures from later world mythology. The Gilgamesh narrative has two distinct parts. In the first, the hero strongly bonds with a wild man, Enkidu, whom the gods created out of clay to be his life- partner. After the two friends demonstrate their courage and martial skill by slaying monsters such as the fiery Humbaba and the ferocious “bull of heaven,” a manifes- tation of drought and earthquake, Gilgamesh makes a fatal decision: he rejects the sexual advances of Ishtar, the powerful goddess of love and war, and the divine patron of his city, Uruk. After Ishtar, furious over the insult to her charms, per- suades the heavenly council to punish Gilgamesh by afflicting Enkidu with a lethal disease, Gilgamesh, overwhelmed by grief and terrified by his first personal encoun- ter with death, experiences a crisis that changes his life. He determines to find a way to escape human mortality. In the epic’s second part, Gilgamesh embarks on a long and dangerous quest to find the extremely remote island home of his ancestor, Utnapishtim (the Babylo- nian Noah). Because Utnapishtim is the only man to have survived the global del- uge and the only person to whom the gods have granted immortality, Gilgamesh hopes to acquire from him the secret of everlasting life. In his desperate pursuit of life eternal, Gilgamesh endures intense suffering, finally arriving exhausted at Utnapishtim’s faraway paradise. Scoffing at his descen- dant’s unrealistic attempt to avoid death, Utnapishtim reminds Gilgamesh that his host’s possession of immortality stems from unique, unrepeatable circumstances: being selected by Ea, a wise and compassionate god, to build an ark, stock it with pairs of all animals, and thus survive a cataclysm that annihilated all humanity. In pity at Gilgamesh’s despair, Utnapishtim’s wife persuades her husband to reveal that a plant capable of miraculously restoring youth grows at the bottom of the sea. After risking his life to retrieve the plant, Gilgamesh begins his journey back to"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"Heroes and Heroines of Myth 271 Uruk, only to have the plant stolen from him and eaten by a snake. Ironically, the serpent is thus able to shed its skin, ostensibly renewing its life, whereas mortal humans forever lack the ability to rejuvenate. During his search for Utnapishtim, Gilgamesh meets Siduri, a wise barmaid and minor goddess, who tells him that he will never find the everlasting life he seeks, for the gods reserve immortality exclusively for themselves. Instead of wearing him- self out trying to be a god, she says, he must accept the ordinary consolations of humanity’s mortal state, enjoying each day as if it were a festival. In important ways, Gilgamesh s story establishes the model or pattern for the subsequent heroes of Greek and Roman myth. In his inexhaustible ambition and struggle to win undying fame through displays of strength and valor, he resembles Achilles, the //zW’s central character. Like Achilles, Gilgamesh also has a divine mother, the goddess Ninsun, from whom he presumably inherits his superhuman qualities and godlike aspiration. He also anticipates Achilles in identifying with a beloved friend, a second self, whose death precipitates the major turning point in his career. The second part of Gilgamesh’s myth, a dangerous journey across the “waters of death” that includes traversing such diverse mythical sites as the realm of absolute darkness (Erebus) and the brightly jeweled “garden of the gods,” fore- shadows Odysseus’s heroic quest in the Odyssey, As Odysseus provokes the hostihty of Poseidon, which costs him all of his companions, so Gilgamesh elicits Ishtar’s curse that robs him of Enkidu. Both men survive the divine wrath, but only after enduring great hardship and pain do they succeed in returning to their respective homes. In its entirety, Gilgamesh s myth encompasses aspects typical of a Greek hero. These characteristic elements include the hero’s divine parentage, royal status, per- sonal courage, phenomenal strength, skill in waging war and/or vanquishing mon- sters, irresistible drive to surpass all rivals, conflict with a divine adversary, posthu- mous fame and/or deification, and a confrontation with death, typically in the guise of a visit to the Underworld. (Besides braving the “valley of the shadow of death,” Gilgamesh also beholds Enkidu’s ghost, who reveals to him the gloomy nature of the afterlife.) In many cases, such as those of Gilgamesh and Odysseus, the hero’s tale takes a circular form, with his travels among strange and perilous domains followed by a return to his place of origin. But the returning hero does not come back empty-handed: he brings with him invaluable knowledge of distant lands and peoples, as well as a fuller understanding of his role as a mortal human. Imparting otherwise inaccessible wisdom to others “Gilgamesh has his adventures inscribed in stone on Uruk’s walls, and Odysseus conveys all he saw and did to his wife, Penelope-—the hero enriches the community with his life-affirming experience."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"272 The Mythic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes FIGURE 10-1 The Marriage of Heracles and Hebe.

His reward is to be shot with a poisoned ar- row by Heracles—in one of that hero’s irrational (and ironically centaur-like) mo- ments—as Chiron is attempting to stop the centaurs’ rampage at the Lapith wed- ding. In agony but unable to die, Chiron generously offers to trade places with Prometheus, releasing the latter from the rock (see Chapter 14). Chiron, like Perseus, is finally transformed into a constellation, Centaurus, while the centaur-like Heracles will ultimately be elevated to divine status. Indeed, whether or not they are metamorphosed into constellations, most of the heroes are deified in some fashion and become the object of hero cults. Thus, Hera- cles, transformed into a god, marries Hebe and enters directly into the pantheon of Olympian gods (Figure 10-1). In Euripides’ Heracleidae, Heracles and Hebe inter- cede from the heavens and, in direct response to a prayer for help, miraculously cause Heracles’ now elderly former assistant, lolaus, to be young again for just one day, in order to take revenge on Eurystheus, who has been attempting to destroy Heracles’ mother and his children.

The Early HerO: Perseus Perseus is one of the earliest of the Greek heroes. Although he shares some of the traits later seen in Heracles and has some similar adventures, Perseus is nonetheless distinguished by some important differences. Whereas other heroes often have diffi- culties in their encounters with women, whether humans or goddesses, Perseus per- forms all of his exploits either with the aid of or on behalf of women, and he main- tains mutually supportive relationships with them throughout his career. Perhaps because he is less estranged from the feminine powers, Perseus does not journey to the Underworld. Perseus’s Early Life Perseus’s mother, Danae [DA-na-ee], had been imprisoned in a bronze tower by her father, Acrisius, king of Argos. He wanted to keep her from all men in order to protect his rulership by preventing the fulfillment of a prophecy that a son of Danae would kill him. But Zeus, who is attracted to her beauty, comes to her in a shower of gold, releasing once again the procreative power that Acrisius had attempted to re- strain. The child conceived by this miraculous intervention is, like most of the heroes who follow, half-divine. Unlike their sometimes ambivalent response to later heroes, the gods seem to identify closely with Perseus. When Perseus is born, Acrisius sets his daughter and grandson adrift at sea in a chest, an archetypal symbol of both coffin and womb, connecting Perseus to the cycle of life, death, and rebirth that is the traditional province of the Great Goddess. From the very beginning of the myth of Perseus, the opposing powers of male and female, human and divine, are more closely reconciled than they will be again in later hero myths. Danae and the child are protected by Zeus, and, instead of drowning, they float safely to shore on the island of Seriphus, where they are taken in by the fisherman Dictys and where Perseus is raised. But further danger threatens. Dictys’s brother. King Polydectes, desires Danae. She refuses him, and Perseus protects her, offering to bring Polydectes instead any gift of his choice. The shrewd king demands the head of Medusa, one of the three Gorgons, knowing that the attempt would be fatal, thus ridding himself of Perseus and giving himself free access to Danae. Perseus, of course, does not hesitate to volunteer for impossible missions, possessing, by virtue of his divine parentage, the courage and skill to succeed. Perseus and the Gorgon The gods, however, are concerned that, being half-human, Perseus lacks powers suf- ficient to the formidable task he faces. Athene therefore steps in to help, warning Perseus of the difficulties he will encounter and telling him to visit the sisters of the"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"274 The Myth ic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes Gorgon, the Gratae [GRYE-eye] — old, gray hags from birth, with one eye and one tooth to share between them. Snatching the eye, Perseus forces them to reveal the location of the nymphs who possess magical weapons: a pouch, a pair of winged sandals (possibly Hermes’) that will enable him to fly, and a cap of invisibility, which may have belonged to Hades. Hermes also gives him a sickle of adamant, an unbreak- able stone. Finally, Perseus also takes his polished bronze shield (in some versions a mirror), possibly a gift from Athene. The terrifying, deadly aspects of the Great Goddess are portrayed in the Graiae and the Gorgons, whose powers are tamed by the hero in a striking inversion of Gaea’s plan for the castration of Uranus by a sickle; here, however, it is the power of the female that is nullified. (In fact, for Freudian psychologists, decapitation is an unconscious image of castration; thus, the fear of Medusa represents the male fear of castration.) However, while destroying the terrifying chthonic powers of the female, Perseus does not reject feminine powers altogether: his weapons—a pouch, a mirror, a pair of sandals, and a cap—are more “feminine” and less aggressive than those of typical heroes (we cannot imagine, for example, Heracles or Achilles needing to be invisible to his enemies) and depend for their efficacy on magic, rather than on the strength and intelligence, however great, of the hero himself. Fven his sickle, an ag- ricultural tool, is reminiscent not only of Gaea’s arranged castration of Uranus but also of Demeter’s gift of agriculture to humankind. Further, borrowing divine powers for the purposes of his quest, Perseus literally assumes, at least temporarily, powers like flight and invisibility that humans may dream of but are otherwise reserved for the gods. He thus becomes, in effect, a demi- god, foreshadowing his final stellar transformation and reconciling the human and the divine more completely than later heroes were ever to accomplish. Arriving at the Gorgons’ cave, Perseus finds the petrified statues of men who had looked in the face of the horrible creatures with gold wings and hair of snakes. Wait- ing until the Gorgons are asleep, Perseus dons his cap of invisibility. But even though they cannot see him, he is still in danger: if he, too, looks into Medusa’s face, he will be turned to stone. As clever as he is brave, Perseus enters the cave backward, looking into his shield (mirror) so he won’t have to look directly into the terrible face. When he cuts off Medusa’s head, a winged horse — P egasus — s prings from her neck (Fig- ure 10-2). Placing the head in his pouch, Perseus flies off and escapes. Medusa herself is a complex figure. Her wings and her hair of snakes are symbols inherited from the Great Goddess (the Egyptian goddess Isis, for example, was often depicted as a winged goddess), linking the upper and lower worlds in a single figure. Variously described as inhabiting a region near the limits of the ocean or the Garden of the Hesperides, she maintains her connection to the primal Goddess of the Tree (or the Waters) of Fife. Fike Artemis, Medusa is a guardian of the women’s mysteries, of the secrets of the Great Goddess whose chthonic aspects she has come to represent. When Perseus avoids looking at Medusa directly, wisely viewing her reflected image rather than her face, he is astutely avoiding the fate of Actaeon and other males who spy on those mysteries. Medusa’s connection to the upper world of the heavens, where the sky gods now rule, is also evident in her connection with the sacred horses who pull the chariot of the sun, an image common to many myth systems. According to one story about Medusa, she makes love to (or is raped by) Poseidon, who comes to her in the form of a horse; in other versions of that story, she takes the form either of a mare or of"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"Heroes and Heroines of Myth 275 FIGURE 10-2 Perseus Slaying Medusa. This limestone relief from the Temple at Selinus (550-540 B.c.) depicts Perseus cutting off the head of the Gorgon Medusa. Athene looks on as Pegasus, the winged horse, springs forth.

The products of this union are Chrysaor, a human warrior, and Pegasus, the winged horse, who will fly across the heavens pulling the chariot of Zeus that bears his thunderbolt, a variant of the sun- chariot. Medusa is thus closely connected to both the upper world and the Under- world, as was the primal Goddess herself. As the mother of the sacred horse of the sky god, she asserts her powers as a creator figure whose realm includes the light as well as the darkness. Perseus’s Other Adventures On the way home, Perseus comes to the Garden of the Hesperides (as FFeracles will later) where Atlas, afraid that Perseus will steal the Golden Apples, offends the hero, who turns Atlas into a mountain of stone by using the Gorgon’s head."},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"276 The Myth ic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes Taking the long way home (as will both Heracles and Theseus), Perseus stops in Ethiopia, where he sees Princess Andromeda chained to a rock, at the mercy of a sea monster. Her mother, Cassiopeia, it seems, boasted of being more beautiful than the sea nymphs, and Poseidon sent the sea monster to punish the Ethiopians. An- dromeda’s father. King Cepheus, was told that only the sacrihce of his daughter would rid the kingdom of the monster. Perseus offers to rescue Andromeda in exchange for her hand in marriage. Her parents, despite her previous betrothal to Phineus, agree, and Perseus kills the mon- ster (see Color Plate 7). He is then attacked by Phineus and his allies, but he wins the battle by removing the Gorgon’s head from the sack (while he himself looks the other way), turning his opponents to stone. Perseus and Andromeda have a son, Perses, who becomes king of Ethiopia (and was said to be the ancestor of the Persians). Perseus s Return Perseus’s story, much of which is recounted in Apollodorus’s Library, embodies the complete cycle of the heroic rite of passage—departure, testing, triumph, and return. Returning home at last, now with Andromeda, Perseus Ends his mother still pursued by Polydectes. Perseus uses the Gorgon’s head once again to turn Polydectes and his followers to stone. Perseus then returns his magical weapons to Hermes, who restores them to the nymphs. No longer a demigod, Perseus nevertheless brings with him a gift—the Gorgon’s head—which he gives to Athene. The powers of the Great God- dess are now assimilated by Athene—who personifies the wisdom of Zeus—as she puts the Gorgon’s head, with its power to bind men by turning them to stone (pos- sibly an image of impotence), behind her masculine weapon of war, her shield. We may be witnessing in Perseus the emergence of the hero figure as he is dif- ferentiated from the various aspects of the goddess figure at an early stage in the shift from a matriarchal to a patriarchal system. Unlike the later, more exclusively “mas- culine” heroes, whose power depends on separating themselves from women (except, of course, for Odysseus; see Chapter 12), Perseus derives his power directly from females, who give him magical weapons. His heroic acts are performed not in isola- tion, in pursuit of immortality or reputation, but in defense of women: to save his mother from rape or Andromeda from a sea monster. Finally, whereas the later heroes typically have difficulty settling down into peaceful, domestic lives, Perseus does ex- actly that, insisting on marrying Andromeda, bringing her back to his mother, and becoming the progenitor of a large and successful family. Perseus as King Following his return home, Perseus visits his grandfather, Acrisius, hoping to be reconciled. But at the funeral games for a friend, Perseus throws a discus that goes off course and accidentally hits his grandfather, killing him and thus fulhlling the prophecy that a son of Danae would kill Acrisius. Reluctant to assume his grand- father’s throne at Argos after the accident, Perseus trades cities with his cousin Mega- penthes, now king of Tiryns. Perseus had earlier petrified Megapenthes’ father, Proetus, for attacking his own brother, Acrisius (who was Perseus’s grandfather), and usurping his throne. Perseus thus becomes ruler of Tiryns and, eventually, Mycenae."},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"Heroes and Heroines of Myth 277 According to one tradition, Megapenthes eventually kills Perseus to avenge his father. But most versions describe Perseus as living a long and happy life with An- dromeda, who bears him one daughter and five more sons, establishing a political dynasty that rules in Argos for several generations and whose descendants include both Heracles and Eurystheus, who will assign Heracles to his labors. The Death of Perseus One of the earliest functions of the Perseus myth may have been etiological: the myth explains the origin of several constellations. At their deaths, Athene transforms Per- seus and Andromeda into constellations (as did Poseidon on the deaths of Cassiopeia and Cepheus). More important, the hero here fulfills, in the most literal way, the quest for immortality that underlies the heroic myth. Thus, without having to incur the enmity of the gods, Perseus completes the cycle through his heavenly rebirth and acquires the fully divine status—the reunification of the divided self, half-human and half-divine—that later heroes will risk death to achieve. But the reconciliation is not to last. Rarely afterward will male and female, human and god, coexist so harmoniously in a single being. The seeds of the new, more exclusively patriarchal hero figure have been planted. Out of the severed neck of Medusa springs the winged horse Pegasus, whose famous rider, Bellerophon [bel- LER-oh-fahn], will be a new kind of hero who will accept the magical bridle that enables him to mount the horse and kill the Chimaera (a fire-breathing monster, part lion, part goat, and part serpent). Bellerophon also fought the Amazons and performed other amazing feats. But not content, as Perseus was, to return the magical weapons to the gods and settle down to enjoy his fame and the kingdom and bride he had won, Bellerophon mounts the divine steed once more, in an attempt to leap the barriers to the heavens themselves, thus provoking the gods’ hostility—a hero, in other words, much like Heracles. The Archetypal Hero: Heracles It is Heracles [HER-a-kleez] who sets the model for Greek mythological heroes— extraordinary men who often combine the courage and strength of the gods with the bestial instincts of centaurs. The son of Zeus and a mortal woman— Alcmene— Heracles inherits a divided nature, half-human and half-divine; Zeus was said to have extended the night for three days in order to conceive such a son. Yet the two halves never come together for Heracles as they did for Perseus. As befits the son of a god, Heracles is unnaturally brave, strong, and clever, possessed of the spark of the divine fire that always seems, somehow, excessive when embodied in merely human form. Of course, as a hero must, he protects and preserves civilized society with these gifts and enlarges the limits of human knowledge. Bound by his human inheritance, how- ever, he is also capable of animal-like behavior, committing acts sometimes ridicu- lous, sometimes irrational, and sometimes extremely violent. It is thus no accident that few heroes are as closely associated with the centaur as is Heracles, the dual components of his nature as abruptly juxtaposed as they are in the mismatched halves of that bifurcated creature. A being divided against himself, Heracles embodies the"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"278 The Myth ic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes quintessential heroic predicament: how to fulfill the demands of the godlike desire for knowledge and achievement that drive him while bound to a mortal body that can neither fly nor turn invisible and that will surely die. The Life of Heracles Like most heroes, Heracles is threatened even as an infant. Ever-jealous of Zeus’s infidelities, Hera hates Heracles from his birth. In fact, the hero’s name, which means “Glory of Hera,” may reflect the fact that every attempt of Hera’s to destroy Heracles instead enhances his heroic status. According to one myth, Zeus tries to subvert her antagonism by tricking her into nursing the infant while she sleeps. When she awakes and discovers the child, she angrily pulls him from her breast, spilling the milk that becomes the Milky Way. Furious, she tries to get rid of him, sending a serpent into his cradle and thereby reenacting his father’s own battle with the serpent of the god- dess, Typhoeus. The prodigious infant of course strangles the serpent. But though Heracles continues to foil Hera’s attempts to destroy him, he cannot foil his own nature. His early exploits reveal the ambiguity of Heracles’ heroism. Turning his prowess to beneficial use, he kills a marauding lion that had been devouring the flocks of King Thespius. He also sleeps with the king’s fifty daughters, either on fifty successive nights or all on one night. Extraordinary service, extraordinary appetites—these are, from the first, combined in Heracles. One of the most popular of Greek heroes, Heracles has many stories told about his life, our sources for which include Apollodorus, Apollonius of Rhodes’s Argonau- tica, and Homer. These stories cover not just the famous Twelve Eabors but a whole range of tales that run the gamut from the serious to the comic and from the gro- tesque to the tragic. For instance, in his role as civic hero, Heracles helps many kings—leading armies, defeating enemies, and building and defending cities. He is also credited with founding the Olympic Games. He doesn’t always play by the rules, though: in one account, he cuts oflF the noses and ears of an enemy’s ambassadors and sends them back with the body parts hung around their necks. His innate brutality sometimes erupts into his private life as well. Married to Megara [ME-ga-ra] as a reward for his services to her father, Heracles settles down into domestic life. The couple has several children, and the hero appears to be happy. One night, however, in a fit of uncontrollable rage—perhaps sent by the still-angry Hera—he kills his wife and children, a tragic event dramatized in Euripides’ play Heracles. Perhaps the strength, drive, and energy that define his heroic identity could not brook a life of mere domestic contentment. A savior in times of threat or war, the hero becomes a menace in time of peace: trained to use his strength to kill and to glory in his violent victories, how does he control the violence or repress the glorying ego when he leaves the battlefield and returns to civilized life? The Twelve Labors and Other Stories As expiation for his crime of domestic violence, Heracles is forced to perform Twelve Labors (some versions mention only ten) for King Eurystheus, each one designed (probably at the instigation of Hera) to destroy him. Typical of the pattern of the heroic quest, Heracles’ first labors are physical. Using his enormous strength and"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"Heroes and Heroines of Myth 279 FIGURE 10-3 Heracles’ First Labor: Battling with the Nemean Lion. An illustration of the hero’s amazing strength, this vase painting shows the hero strangling with his bare hands the lion whose skin is impenetrable to human weapons. After cleverly skinning it with its own claws, he wears its pelt as a cloak, a symbol of the savage element of the hero’s nature. (University of Pennsylvania Museum, Philadelphia) intelligence, Heracles kills the Hydra (a many-headed water snake whose heads would immediately regrow if cut off) by cleverly instructing a friend to use a torch to sear the neck of each head as the hero severs it. He also captures the Arcadian boar (also called the Erymanthian boar, after Mount Erymanthus, where he captures it) and the Cretan bull and tames the man-eating Thracian horses. But even the very first of the labors reveals the savage core of the hero’s heart. Killing the ravaging lion of Nemea whose skin was impervious to human weapons, Heracles uses brute force by choking it to death with his bare hands (Figure 10-3). Required to bring back its skin as proof of the deed, Heracles demonstrates his clev- erness by using its own claws to skin the lion. From this time forward, Heracles wears the lion skin as a cloak, as if he himself has become the marauding beast. Further manifesting his animal nature and suggesting his regression to a precivilized state, Heracles shapes his famous club at this point, substituting this primitive weapon for the more conventional and equally famous bow that had been his trademark (Fig- ures 10-4 and 10-5).

This statue (c. 490- 475 B.c.) from the Temple of Aphaia at Aegina portrays Heracles in the act of shooting his famous bow and wearing the armor of a con- ventional Greek warrior. The stable posture, calm expression, and firmly outstretched arm suggest rationality, self-control, and supreme self-confidence. (Glyptothek, Munich) hairy and prone to bouts of excessive drunkenness, often in the company of centaurs. During one such episode, he shoots the good centaur, Chiron, by mistake, the strong right arm going into action before the brain is engaged: like many heroes after him, Heracles’ instinct is to shoot first and ask questions later. In other stories, he is de- picted comically, the object of sometimes coarse jokes. On one such occasion, he captures two enemy soldiers and slings them from a pole over his shoulders. Faced with a close-up view of the hero’s hairy rear end, the two soldiers begin to laugh. Finding their laughter momentarily amusing, Heracles releases them! On the positive side, several of the labors present the hero in his civic function as preserver of society and civilized life—killing the Stymphalian birds who were plaguing one town, for example, or cleaning out the Augean stables by diverting two rivers through the barn. Another task involved bringing back the belt of the Amazon Queen Hippolyte: perhaps she yielded to him, or perhaps he killed her for it; either way, he “tamed” a formidable female opponent. In the most incredible group of labors, Heracles fulfills the hero’s most significant function—to extend the parameters of human experience, to embody the scope of the human imagination stretched to its limits, and to retrieve the power and knowl- edge otherwise limited to the gods.

In all the hero’s quests, Heracles calls on his divine gifts to commit death-defying acts, but, tainted by his human inheritance, he must finally confront the most for- midable obstacle of all: his own death. Twice, Heracles voyages to the Underworld, undertaking the archetypal rite of passage that all heroes must fulfill in this most urgent of human quests—the need to find a loophole to escape the ultimate trap of mortality.

Killing the Nemean lion, whose hide was impervious to weapons. Heracles chokes the lion to death with his bare hands and uses its own claws to skin it. Thenceforth, he wears its pelt as a cloak. He also fashions his famous club at this time to substitute for his trademark bow. 2. Killing the Hydra, a many-headed water snake whose heads would im- mediately grow back when severed. To prevent the heads from regenerating, Heracles arranges for a friend to sear the necks with a torch as each head is severed. Heracles then applies its poisonous gall to his arrows. (Eurystheus re- fused to count this labor because Heracles had help.) 3. Capturing the Cerynitian hind, a golden-horned deer sacred to Artemis. To capture the deer, Heracles has to pursue it for a year. In some versions, he has to travel to the mythical North, the land of the Hyperboreans, to find it. (Note: the sequence of the third and fourth labors is sometimes reversed.) 4. Capturing the Erymanthian boar, which he has to pursue into territory oc- cupied by the centaurs. While he is there, his host, the centaur Pholus, opens a barrel of wine, thereby attracting the other centaurs, who attack Heracles. Heracles drives them off, but in the process he accidentally wounds his host and the centaur Chiron with poisoned arrows. 5. Cleaning the Augean stables, for which Heracles demands a promise of pay- ment from King Augeas. He accomplishes this unpleasant task by diverting the course of a river (or two) to wash through the barn. Because Augeas refuses to pay him, Heracles later returns with an army. (Eurystheus refused to count this labor, too, since Heracles demanded payment.) 6. Removing the Stymphalian birds, whose droppings were creating a public nuisance in an Arcadian town. (According to some versions, they also ate the three-headed hound of Hades, shooting the god Hades, King of the Underworld, in the process. Having thus gone to the Land of the Dead and been reborn twice— having taken on Death himself, and won—Heracles transcends the limits of the human condition, achieving literally what most heroes can achieve only through the consolation of an immortal reputation. Heracles, like most hero figures, thus medi- ates the most extreme of contradictions—not only those of nature and culture but those of life and death as well. The Death of Heracles There are innumerable stories about Heracles apart from the labors, among them the voyage with Jason and the Argonauts—another mythic anachronism, because Jason and the Argonauts do not appear until several generations after Heracles’ death. Dur- ing that voyage, the tables are turned on Heracles.

Heracles drives away these Birds by using brass rattles to frighten them olf and by shooting many of them as they fly away, 7. Capturing the Cretan bull, the bovine parent of the Minotaur. Bringing it back, Heracles releases it near Marathon. (Theseus has to recapture it later.) 8. Captutittg the Thracian horses, property of King Diomedes. To tanie the horses, which ate human flesh, Heracles feeds their owner to them. While the guest of King Admetus, Heracles rescues Admetus’s wife, Alcestis, from death-—actually wresding with Death (Thanatos) in the process. 9. Bringing back the girdle (belt) of Hippolyte, the Amazon queen. Hip- polyte gives the girdle to Heracles willingly, which angers Hera, who per- suades the other Amazons that Heracles was actually kidnapping Hippolyte. When they attack Heracles’ ship, he kills the queen, believing she has lied to him, and keeps the belt. 10. Bringing back the cattle of Geryon, the three-headed giant sometimes iden- tiiied as the herdsman of the dead. On this trip, the hero sets up the Pillars of Heracles at the western entrance to the Mediterranean. 11. Bringing back the Golden Apples of the Hesperides, apples of immortality that grow on the Tree of Life in the garden in the mythical West, where the sun sets. According to some versions, the Titan Atlas gets the apples while Heracles holds up the sky in his place, 12. Gapturing Cerberus (the three-headed, or fifty-headed, hound of Hades) , In order to accomplish this task, Heracles is first initiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries to learn how to safely traverse the kingdom of Hades. In some ver- sions, he shoots Hades himself, wounding him in the process. (Freudian theorists see the water nymph—the pool maiden who lures men to their deaths—as an expression of the fear of the female genitals, much as decapitation of the Gorgon represents the male fear of castration.) Heracles’ search for him proves fruitless, and he is eventually forced to sail on without him. The many sides of the hero are summed up in the story of Heracles’ death. Having remarried, this time to Deianeira [dee-ya-NYE-ra], the sister of a friend, Heracles is still unable to rest con- tentedly at home. Eventually, tired of his unremitting pursuit of both erotic and heroic adventures, Deianeira sets out in pursuit of Heracles, determined to bring him home. Unable to cross a river in her path, she accepts a ride from a centaur, Nessus, who ferries her halfway across and then tries to rape her. Fortunately, Heracles comes along just in time, shoots the centaur, and rescues his wife (Figure 10-7). The dying Nessus offers Deianeira a way to ensure Heracles’ commitment to her: he tells her to collect Nessus’s blood, now mixed with the poisonous blood of the Hydra on Heracles’ arrows, and to smear it on his shirt. As dramatized in Sophocles’ Women of Trachis, when Heracles dons the shirt, the mixture eats through his flesh, and, de- stroyed by Deianeira’s attempt to domesticate him, Heracles dies."},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"284 The Mythic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes FIGURE 10-6 Heracles’ Third Labor: Pursuing the Cerynitian Hind. The two conflicting aspects of the hero illustrated in Figures 10-4 and 10-5 are captured in this vase painting: as the daring explorer, Heracles pursues the mythical Golden Hind into the unknown North and brings back its golden antlers; as a creature of brute force, he wears the lion skin and, relinquishing his weapons (here held for him by two goddesses, possibly Athene and Arte- mis), he pulls off the antlers with his bare hands. (British Museum, London) Heracles was said to have no grave. According to some versions of the myth, his soul goes to the Underworld while only his reputation endures; other versions, how- ever, portray Heracles as raised up by the gods from his funeral pyre to be a god on Olympus (Figure 10-8), where he is reconciled to Hera and married to her daughter Hebe, who may be a surrogate for the goddess herself, fulfilling at last the quest for immortality that is central to the heroic endeavor. As Hera’s son-in-law, Heracles is formally reconciled with the feminine powers, and Hera and “the Glory” that is now truly hers are rejoined. Homer, combining both versions in the Odyssey (Book 11), describes Heracles’ human part remaining as a shade in Hades while his divine self takes up residence with the gods. The hero remains divided in death as he was in life, as complex as human nature itself. With this final transfiguration, the ongoing conflict between the masculine hero and the feminine principle is at last transcended. The hero can safely participate in this hieros gamos, or sacred marriage between the hero and the goddess: since she is no longer an obstacle to his pursuit of immortality, he will not feel compelled to abandon her. Nor will he need to use violence or risk death to pursue the same goal. Thus, the inherent contradictions in the hero’s nature are at last resolved: in death, if not in life, the beast and the god are reconciled."},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"Heroes and Heroines of Myth 285 FIGURE 10-7 Heracles and Nessus. In his last heroic exploit, Heracles grabs Nessus by the hair and puts his foot on the creature’s back, as the lying centaur offers one last gesture of supplication. This vase painting (c. 620 B.C.) is one of many illustrations of Heracles’ associations with the creatures whose physically divided natures re- flect his own inner divisions—part god, part brute. Nessus’s role in the death of Heracles reflects the destructive potential of the conflict- ing drives at work in the warrior-hero. (NationalMuseum, Athens) Other Heroes; Theseus and )dson Other heroes share many of the characteristics exemplified by the myths of Heracles: the divine parentage or ancestry; the amazing feats and pursuit of impossible quests; the problems with the women in their lives; and, finally, despite their heroic achieve- ments, their oddly nonheroic deaths. In addition, as the role of the hero and that of king or ruler converge, the lives of the heroes increasingly involve political problems as well. Theseus The hero Theseus follows (sometimes quite literally) in the footsteps of Heracles. His mother is Aethra, daughter of King Pittheus of Troezen; his father’s identity is somewhat ambiguous, since his mother slept with Aegeus [EE-jee-uhs] (king of Ath- ens) and the sea god Poseidon on the same night.

(Antikensammlungen, Munich) Early Adventures Rivaling Heracles in the number of tales told about him (vari- ously recounted by Plutarch, Apollodorus, and others), Theseus is also similar to Heracles in the specific adventures he encounters (Figure 10-9). Setting out for Ath- ens, the young Theseus rids the road of various threats to travelers: a robber who beat his victims with a bronze club (reminiscent of Heracles’ club), which Theseus takes; another who tied his victims to a pair of pine trees bent to the ground, which, when released, would tear them in two; another who pushed his victims over a cliff to be eaten by a giant sea turtle; and another who wrestled all passersby to death. Like Heracles, Theseus kills a menacing wild boar. He also punishes Procrustes on the same iron bed used by the brigand to torture his victims. Some of Theseus’s adventures were actually identical to those of Heracles. The- seus, sent by his father (who was prompted, in turn, by his dangerous current wife, Medea) to capture the same Cretan bull once captured by Heracles, brings it back successfully. And Heracles and Theseus, several generations removed from each other, even share adventures. Theseus joins Heracles on the voyage of the Argonauts and on his expedition against the Amazons.

Hoping to free Athens from this threat, Theseus volunteers to go along as one of the seven men. Before Theseus departs, his father asks him to change his ship’s black sail to a white one in the event of his successful return.

As shown in this vase painting, Theseus takes his sword to the Minotaur, here depicted with a human body but a bull’s tail and head. As with Fieracles and the centaurs, the multiple associations of the hero with beasts (especially divided creatures like the Minotaur, half-man and half-bull) suggest the battle with the beast within: the savage drives normally repressed within the labyrinth of the unconscious that the life of the warrior-hero forces to the surface.

Theseus, of course, succeeds and returns to Athens but forgets to change sails. His father, seeing the ship approaching with black sails, believes his son has died and commits suicide by jumping from a cliff (or from the walls of Athens). From the historical perspective, this myth may reflect a shift in the center of power in the Mediterranean from Crete to the mainland, thus ending the condition of the Greek coastal city-states as tributaries of the Cretan empire. Enormous Cretan palaces, such as the one at Knossos, with its endless rooms and corridors, could easily have given rise, as some historians have suggested, to legends of a “labyrinth” in its basement. Undoubtedly more significant are archaeologists’ discoveries of shrines to the Mi- noan snake goddess built deep into the recesses of Cretan mountain caves, where bull horns and other images of the bull god, consort to the goddess, are also found. The entrances and underground passageways to these shrines themselves constitute a kind of labyrinth. The word labrys, furthermore, means “double-headed axe,” and the labyrinth of the myth thus also refers to the palace at Knossos, where sculptures, wall paintings, and vases employ that symbol of the goddess, as well as to the cave temples where she was worshiped (Figure 10-11) and where double-headed gold axes, pre- sumably belonging to the goddess, were found. Some scholars note that Theseus appears to be a much later Athenian creation— the earliest visual representations appear in the seventh century B.C., and the earliest"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"Heroes and Heroines of Myth 289 FIGURE 10-11 The Goddess of the Double Axe. In this wall painting from the palace of Minos (c. 1500 B.C.), the goddess displays the labrys, or double-headed axe, to her worshipers. (Knossos, Crete) literary references date from the late sixth or early fifth century B.C.— which would deny in the Theseus myths reflections of any changes in Cretan or Mycenaean politics or religion. But the fact that Fiomer provides us with the first literary references to the Trojan War does not preclude some basis of historicity, preserved for centuries in oral tradition, in the myths of Troy. And references to Cretan politics or lifestyles or to the palace of Minos, long since buried (and excavated in our own time), should be no more surprising—or necessarily purely fantastic—than Fiomer’s reference to cita- dels like Tiryns. Questions of historicity apart, the archetypal components of the labrys, the central image of this myth, prevail. The image of the double-headed axe, recapitulated in the curved bull horns, is also associated with the butterfly, symbol of transformation. In the image of the labyrinth, then, life and death, sacrifice and renewal, converge on each other. From the mythic perspective, we can thus see in the story of Theseus’s descent into the labyrinth the persistence of the Cretan snake goddess, herself the source of many of the Greek goddesses, part of whose worship was carried out in the Cretan Bull Dance painted on palace walls and numerous vases excavated at Knossos. Such ceremonies often involved the ritual mating of the goddess in her cow form with the bull god, who would then be sacrificed, perhaps in place of the king, to ensure the renewal of fertility. The intercourse between Queen Pasiphae, in her cow costume, and the bull, may be the narrative form of that ritual. Similarly, Theseus’s entry into the center of the labyrinth, following the string that Ariadne offers (acting here in the role of priestess of the Goddess), suggests a retracing of the umbilical link to the womb where the mysteries of the Goddess are hidden, followed by the rebirth into the upper world. And his killing of the bull and the subsequent destruction of the labyrinth may, some scholars suggest, reflect the shift from the ancient Cretan goddess religion to the patriarchal system that supplanted it in Greece. Theseus’s Women Women are involved in many of Theseus’s adventures, as they are in those of Fieracles, but none of the relationships ends happily. For example, Theseus sails from Crete with Ariadne but abandons her on the way home on the island of Naxos, where (according to variant myths) she is killed by Artemis, or mar- ries the god Dionysus, or commits suicide, grieving for the loss of Theseus."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"290 The Myth ic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes Theseus also seduces and/or defeats the Amazon Queen Hippolyte (or her sister Antiope), whose forces then invade Athens but are, in turn, defeated. This relation- ship produces a son, Hippolytus [hip-PAHL-ih-tuhs], who comes to cause Theseus great distress. Having married Phaedra [FE-drah], the sister of Ariadne, Theseus leaves her with Hippolytus while he goes to Troezen. As dramatized in Euripides’ play Hippolytus, Phaedra falls in love with the young man, but he refuses her advances, having taken a vow of celibacy in honor of the goddess Artemis. Furious at being rejected, Phaedra tells Theseus that Hippolytus raped her and then kills herself The- seus calls on Poseidon to kill his son, and the god obligingly sends a bull from the sea to terrijfy Hippolytus’s chariot horses, which bolt, overturning the chariot. Trapped in the reins, Hippolytus is dragged to his death. Artemis then tells Theseus that Hip- polytus was innocent and that Aphrodite, angry at the boy’s exclusive devotion to Artemis, is responsible for the catastrophe. In some oblique way, of course, Theseus’s own unpredictable erotic urges are to blame: it was he, after all, who, driven by his lust, abandoned Ariadne for Phaedra and then, like Heracles, went off on other ad- ventures, leaving Phaedra, in turn, alone. The myths tell of many marriages of Theseus, but, like Heracles, he engages in no meaningful or lasting relationships. In yet another example of sexual misadventures, Theseus and his friend Pirithous kidnap Helen, as a child, in order to fulfill their ambition to marry a daughter of Zeus himself, something Heracles achieved only after death. The audacious pair then fix on a scheme to bring Persephone up from the Underworld for Pirithous. Both are bound by Hades to iron chairs for eternity, but only Pirithous remains in the Underworld. Theseus is rescued from the Under- world by Heracles; however, his relationship with the feminine powers remains de- structive. The hero can no more domesticate the divine than the human women in his life can domesticate the hero. Political Problems Theseus’s kidnapping of Helen brings down the wrath of the Spartans, who attack Athens, rescue her in Theseus’s absence, and establish a rival, Menestheus, on the throne. This is not the first time Theseus has had to protect his rule against usurpers. Earlier, Medea had played on his father’s rivalry with his uncle Pallas, brother to Aegeus, who, with his fifty sons, kept trying to take over rulership of Athens. When Medea persuaded Aegeus to send Theseus to capture the Cretan bull, it was with the hope that he wouldn’t return, so that her own sons could succeed to the throne. This failing, she tried to poison Theseus, but Aegeus fortunately rec- ognized the sword his son wore and foiled her plan. Pallas and his sons repeatedly rebel, and eventually Theseus kills them, but he has to go into exile to Troezen as a result. Despite the political threats, Theseus manages to unify Athens, to form a central government, and to forge alliances with surrounding towns, thus establishing Athens’s dominance over Attica, just as Perseus had established his own dominions. The Death of Theseus Theseus’s death may also have resulted from political rival- ries. Traveling to Scyrus to get allies to help him evict the usurper Menestheus, The- seus either falls or is pushed off a cliff, recapitulating the death of his own father. Like Heracles’ death, however, Theseus’s less-than-glorious demise is followed by a trans- figuration to divine status. Honored by the Athenians—who believed that the spirit of Theseus watched over their city, aiding them in the war against the Persians and even appearing at the Battle of Marathon—Theseus was worshiped as a god."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"Heroes and Heroines of Myth 291 Jason The most equivocal of the heroes, Jason shares the heroic traits of Heracles and Theseus—the divine ancestry, the search for glory, the performing of impossible tasks—but in a somewhat diminished (if not ironic) and oddly eclectic form. Thus, although we have a single extended source for most of the details, it almost seems as if the myth of Jason were constructed from scraps of the myths of other heroes. The son of Aeson of lolcos, Jason is the grandson of Aeolus, who may be the wind god or a human with the same name. Aeson’s brother, Pelias [PEE-lih-uhs], usurped the throne of lolcos, so when Jason is born, his parents have him raised in secret by the centaur Chiron. Also reminiscent of Theseus’s myth, a sandal is one of the signs Jason displays on his return. Pelias had been told by an oracle that a man descended from Aeson and wearing one sandal would kill him: on the trip to lolcos, Jason loses one sandal while helping Hera, disguised as an old woman, cross a river. Thus, ac- cording to one account, when Jason returns to lolcos lacking one sandal, Pelias rec- ognizes him instantly and determines to get rid of him. The Golden Fleece To dispose of Jason, Pelias sends him to get the Golden Fleece, This is an impossible mission since the fleece is located in the distant land of Colchis, ruled by King Aeetes, who has a reputation for treating visitors abominably. To gain glory, Jason, like Perseus and Theseus, accepts this challenge and sets about organiz- ing an expedition—one of the most famous in Greek mythology—of Argonauts (sailors on the ship the Argo, commissioned for this purpose). All the heroes— whether of Jason’s generation or not, including Heracles, Orpheus, and, in some versions, Theseus, share the quest (Figure 10-12). After a long series of adventures during which they do battle with human rivals and monsters, propitiate the Phrygian mother goddess Cybele, and avoid, with Athene’s help, being crushed by the Clashing Rocks, they arrive at Colchis. Hera, meanwhile, has a vested interest in the quest: having been insulted by Pelias, who worships the other gods but scorns Hera, she wants Pelias dead and believes that no one but Medea [me-DEE-a] can accomplish that. Thus, she wants Jason to bring Medea back with him. Athene also supports the operation, and Aphrodite assists by causing Medea to fall in love with Jason on his arrival. Just as Ariadne helped Theseus, Medea helps Jason obtain the Golden Fleece, but with a difference. Before Aeetes will give Jason the fleece, he orders the hero to per- form another impossible feat: he must yoke a fire-breathing bull, plow a field, and sow it with dragon’s teeth, left over, apparently, from the founding of Thebes by Cadmus. Just as in the Theban myth, Jason must kill the armed men who germinate from these teeth. Protected by a drug that Medea gives him, which he applies to himself and his weapons, Jason performs the task, only to find that Aeetes reneges on his promise and plans to attack the Argonauts. Jason must therefore steal the fleece and escape in secret. But unlike Theseus, who killed the Minotaur, Jason doesn’t actually fight the serpent or dragon guarding the tree on which the Golden Fleece is hung; rather, Medea, trusting Jason’s promise to marry her, casts a spell to put the creature to sleep so that Jason can safely remove the object of his quest. To prevent pursuit by Aeetes, Medea kills and dismembers the corpse of her younger brother, tossing the pieces in the sea so that her father will be obliged to stop and retrieve them in order to give his son a proper burial.

Except for the figures of Athene, wearing a warrior’s helmet and carrying a spear (left), and Heracles, wearing a lion skin and holding a club (center), easily identifiable by their characteristic insignia or apparel, scholars disagree on the identities of the other figures. Although commonly described as a scene de- picting the Argonauts who accompanied Jason on his quest for the Golden Fleece, the paint- ing (c. 450 B.c.) may in fact represent Heracles’ descent into the Underworld. If so, the two seated heroes are Theseus and his friend Pirithous, who had rashly invaded Hades’ realm to abduct Persephone as a wife for Pirithous (see Chapter 9). (Louvre, Paris) the savage Heracles, who cut off the ears and noses of his enemy’s ambassadors, could match such gratuitous violence. The Role of Hecate As Perseus was aided by Athene, so Jason continues to be helped by Medea. But again, although both Athene and Hera continue to support the Argonauts’ mission, the contrasts are significant: Perseus attacks the Gorgons, the terrifying aspect of the primordial Goddess, and delivers up their power to the Olym- pian goddess Athene; Jason, on the other hand, propitiates the chthonic powers, per- forming rituals in honor of Hecate [HEK-uh-tee] (some of whose powers Medea shares) both before and after his trials. It is the power of Hecate that allows him both to obtain the fleece and to escape afterward. And whereas heroes like Theseus and Heracles descend to the Underworld to subdue the power of Hades and defy mor- tality, Jason enters only the barbaric region of Golchis, portrayed in the myths as a remote and savage place where witchcraft and sorcery flourish and where, rather than defy the chthonic powers, he succumbs to them. From this point on, the acts that Jason allows Medea to perform on his behalf"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"Heroes and Heroines of Myth 293 become more appalling, while Jason himself behaves increasingly less like a hero and more like a self-serving coward who uses women as a means to gain his objectives. Ultimately, his quest for glory yields to a crass desire for wealth and status. Mean- while, the Olympians who supported the Argonauts’ voyage disappear. In the absence of the gods, the tension between the human and the divine that sustained, however tragically, the heroic endeavor likewise vanishes. The heroic quest for victory over time—for the power of immortality—degenerates into a quest for power in merely human and thus venial terms. Jasons Return When Jason returns with the Golden Fleece, his uncle Pelias—who has in the meantime killed Jason’s father and thereby prompted his mother’s sui- cide— is still on the throne. Medea, however, trading on her reputation as a sorceress, convinces Pelias’s daughters that their aging father will be rejuvenated if they kill him, dismember the corpse, and cook it. They perform Medea’s prescribed ritual—but, of course, without the desired result. Having thus succeeded to the throne of lolcos by this somewhat questionable method, Jason forfeits the trust of its people, and he and Medea are forced to leave. Whereas other heroes typically have strong regional associations—Perseus and Heracles with Mycenae and Tiryns, for example, and Theseus with Athens—Jason, already abandoned by the gods, becomes a man without a country. Emigrating to Corinth, he and Medea set up residence and have two children. But Jason is not content and, as dramatized in Euripides’ Medea (see Chapter 17), decides to fulfill his ambitions for power by abandoning Medea and marrying the princess of Corinth, daughter of King Creon, an ironic inversion of the typical heroic achievement of status in spite of or even in defiance of marriage. He also demands custody of the two children, claiming that he can support them better being married to the princess than he can as Medea’s common-law husband. Medea Refusing to yield, Medea poisons the princess and King Creon and (at least in Euripides’ version) kills the children. She then escapes in a dragon-powered chariot to Athens, where she has been promised asylum by King Aegeus in return for her promise to cure his infertility. (The child thus conceived, when Aegeus stops off briefly in Troezen and makes love to Aethra as he is returning to Athens, turns out to be none other than Theseus, who, in the typically timeless world of intersecting myths, had already accompanied Jason on his voyage to Colchis.) In her role as the source of fertility, as in her continuing connection with drag- ons ^— the dragon that guards the Golden Fleece and the winged dragon that pulls the chariot given to her as a gift by her grandfather, Helios—Medea carries out the creative and transformative functions of the primordial Goddess. But as was true of Medusa, with whom Medea shares a link with the serpents/dragons and the sun- chariot, these powerful symbols are now reinterpreted, as was the role of Medea’s divine counterpart, Hecate, in a more perverse and terrifying fashion as evidence of her witchcraft. Nevertheless, Medea drives the chariot of the sun, and unlike Phae- thon, whose attempt to drive the sun vehicle ended in a fatal crash, she has no diffi- culty. The powers she commands are so awesome that it’s no wonder Jason is no match for her. If the sky gods and the heroes who emulate them have succeeded in decapitating the ancient Goddess, driving her underground and transforming her into a witch or sorceress, then in figures like Medea the Goddess has her revenge."},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"294 The Myth ic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes The Death of Jason Jasons death is the most inglorious of all of the heroes’. Bereft of friends and family as he sits, dejected, under the prow of his rotting ship, Jason is killed when a beam falls and hits him on the head. Jason is not elevated—as are Theseus, Perseus, and Heracles—to the status of divinity or made into the object of a cult. With Jason, in death as in the latter part of his life, the hero hgure has reached a new low. The Upp er Limits of Human Ambition: Phaethon The Greeks were fascinated by heroes in the excessive Heracleian mold—indeed, they admired no hero more than Achilles, who shares many of the earlier heroes’ qualities. But a society that came to value the Apollonian way of self-knowledge and moderation could hardly maintain that such heroes were appropriate role models. If myths about Heracleian heroes emphasize the transcendent elements of the fraction- alized hero—half-human, half-divine—other myths, providing an alternative per- spective on the heroic impulse, reminded the Greeks of the necessary limits on hu- man ambition. The myths of Icarus (see Ghapter 2) and Phaethon, young men who defy those limits, reinforce the need to be aware of one’s human limitations and to exercise self-control. But no one makes songs to the memories of those who walk the middle way: the Golden Mean is not the road that heroes travel. When Glymene tells her son Phaethon [FEE-e-thahn] that he is actually the son of Helios, the sun god, the young man travels to the god’s palace and requests proof of his divine paternity. Helios (or Apollo, in Ovid’s later retelling in the Meta- morphoses) promises to grant any wish that his son might make. Admiring the glori- ous chariot of the sun that his father drives, Phaethon asks to drive it himself for one day. Although he knows that the chariot is beyond the boy’s powers, Helios is bound by his promise and reluctantly yields. Phaethon is eager to test the power of the marvelous vehicle and starts off with great exuberance, but, as his father predicted, he loses control of the steeds. They veer off course: first, bolting up into the heavens, they leave a visual reminder of the havoc Phaethon causes, the great scar of the Milky Way; then, careening down, they set the earth on fire from the intense heat of the sun. To save the earth from destruction, Zeus is forced to kill Phaethon with a lightning bolt. Once again, overconfidence and the desire to take on tasks better suited to the gods prove deadly. Mortals need to be reminded: half-divine is simply not enough. The Heroine: Aomen s Mysteries in a Man s Aorld Heroine is a term that must be used with caution in describing women in Greek mythology. Gertainly, in many myths, females play a central role, and in the literary works based on mythic themes, such as the plays of the great Greek dramatists, fe- males are often the protagonists. But unlike their male counterparts, who embodied the ideal of the warrior that most young boys would aspire to emulate, women in the myths are rarely held up as models for young girls, and even more rarely for the same qualities of strength and courage that the male heroes displayed. Nor do the heroines often go on quests or engage in combat with monsters or"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"Heroes and Heroines of Myth 295 gods. Although a few become constellations (Andromeda, for example), they usually are granted that gift only when their husbands are likewise granted stellar status. Further, the ultimate lure of ascension to divinity does not motivate heroines, as it does the heroes; there are no heroines who seek, as Gilgamesh does, to live forever, or even, like Heracles, Achilles, or Hector, to leave behind a name that will endure for eternity. For the women, perhaps reflecting the cyclical pattern of the creator goddess whose role is cosmic maintenance, eternal life happens, if they are fortunate, through the survival of their children, which is why the myths of Hecuba and An- dromache, who lose all their children (as in Euripides’ Trojan Wometi), are so tragic. Women’s Rituals These differences reflect similar contrasts in the rites of passage for women. The archetypal male rite of passage involves the initiand’s separation from the community, isolation while he grapples with supernatural forces, and victorious return to the com- munity bearing new insights into himself and his relationship to society, to the gods, and to the cosmos. For the Greek heroes, it is the goddess Athene, embodying the wisdom of Zeus and the martial skill of the warrior, who supports them in their trials. The female rites of passage, in contrast, are collective rather than individual experi- ences. And it is the goddess Artemis who not only presides over the initiation of young girls but also is usually associated with the lives of the heroines thereafter. The initiation ritual for girls was called the Brauronia, after the location of Ar- temis’s shrine at Brauron, in Attica, where the ritual, performed by girls before they reached puberty, took place. The most important part of the ritual was the Arkteia, in which the girls ran as “bears,” either nude or wearing short garments (Fig- ure 10-13). Races are not unusual in women’s initiations in many cultures. Bruce Lincoln, in his study of women’s rituals, describes how Navajo girls, for example, undergo the “Kinaalda of Ghanging Woman,” which also includes a race in which the initiands pursue the course of the sun and reenact creation—the emergence of life from successive underworlds onto the earth’s surface. Participating in the initia- tion ritual, the girl is led to understand her relationship to the world of nature. In the Brauronia, the connection to the natural world is emphasized through the act of playing the bear. Artemis, of course, as goddess of the beasts, is the bear god- dess, and she often appears as a doe or a she-bear. But she is also goddess of the hunt and thus unites the pursuing huntress with the hunted animal—life with death—as did the primordial Goddess herself Not surprisingly, Artemis has links with all three levels of the cosmos: with the heavens, both as Olympian twin sister of Apollo and in her connection with the lunar cycle; with the earth as the lady of the beasts; and with the Underworld in her association with Hecate, her Underworld counterpart. Fur- thermore, as a virgin goddess who nevertheless is patron of childbirth, she prepares young girls for their roles as brides and future mothers. In fact, the clothes of women who died in childbirth (shot by the golden arrows of Artemis, as those who died of disease were shot by the silver arrows of her twin, Apollo) were offered to Artemis at Brauron. Running as a bear, each girl enters the sisterhood of Artemis and becomes the bear goddess, as well as her eventual potential victim, for unlike Artemis herself and her small band of followers who shun the society of men, the initiand cannot become a virgin goddess. The inevitable end of the chase is perhaps best revealed in the fate of"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"296 The Myth ic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes FIGURE 10-13 The Brauronia.

Attracted to her but unable to approach one who avoids male society, Zeus tricks Callisto by disguising himself as Artemis until it is too late for her to escape. Impregnated by the god, Callisto is forced to leave Artemis’s band of followers. After the birth of her son, Callisto is turned into a bear—a clear insult to the bear goddess—by Hera, angered at her husband’s infidelity and the means he used to carry it out. Callisto wanders in the forest alone for years, while her son Areas grows up not knowing his mother. One day while out hunting, he encounters the she-bear and is prevented from unwittingly committing matricide only by the intervention of Zeus himself, who transforms Callisto into the Great Bear constellation. The girl racing as a she-bear in the Brauronia ritual celebrates the final moments of the freedom of childhood, before puberty transforms her into a woman, ready to accept her sexuality and enter the world where men—and gods—prevail. Prepared by her understanding both of the role she must relinquish and of the one she must soon assume, the initiand is ready for the onset of puberty and the marriage that will follow: in the life of a woman, Artemis must become Persephone.

In this vase painting (c. 560 B.C.), Heracles, in his lion skin, is attacking an Amazon named Andromache (not Hector’s wife), as other sol- diers fight other Amazon warriors. (Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston) in combat with most of the male heroes: Bellerophon, Heracles, and Theseus, for example, all fought the Amazons (Figure 10-14), and Achilles is described as having done battle with the Amazon queen, Penthesilia (Figure 10-15), only realizing after he killed her and removed her armor that she was a woman (see Chapter 11). But while standing up to Achilles confirms the Trojan Hector as a true hero, being a worthy opponent to Achilles made Penthesilia—an Amazon! Then, as now, to be an “Amazon” was to be an aberration, a kind of monstrosity, like the dragon, that the hero must destroy. The skills displayed by female warriors in such myths never sug- gested the possibility that a normal woman could, given equivalent encouragement and training, wield weapons, serve in the military, or exhibit the courage or develop the physical skills of men. Indeed, Amazons seem to have existed largely to be de- feated by male heroes—unless they are abducted and made to conform to the stan- dard social model. The Amazon queen Antiope (or Hippolyte), for example, was abducted by Theseus and bore him a son, Hippolytus. Patterns of the Heroine Myths When women in the myths are heroines, they are always portrayed in their relation- ship to their fathers or sons, husbands or lovers—the real “heroes.” In that capacity, those who properly fulfill those roles, as defined from the men’s perspective, are held up to be models of loyalty and obedience (such as Alcestis, or Helen in Euripides’ Helen). Those who, for various reasons, refuse to do so are condemned as whores (such as Helen in the Iliad ox Clytemnestra in AtsdrLyXxxss Agamemnon), witches (such as Medea) or monsters (such as Agave). But the rewards of wifely virtue and the consequences of rebellion end up the same. The women who are loyal and obedient to their hero-husbands often end up as widows, typically either enslaved or them- selves dead as well; those who defy the established order often end up being killed or martyring themselves. And while deceased male heroes have songs and stories im-"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"298 The Mythic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes FIGURE 10-15 Achilles and Penthesilia.

The heroines in the myths, then, fall into several patterns, which sometimes over- lap. First are the wives or mothers of heroes, whose bravery consists of remaining loyal even in the face of death (unless rescued by a male hero). Next are the helper- maidens, whose function is to assist the heroes in their quests (often to be uncere- moniously dumped when their assistance is no longer needed).

Then there are the brides of Death, who martyr themselves rather than compromise their integrity. Fi- nally, there are the victorious heroines, exceptional women who somehow manage to retain their independence and to pursue their goals aggressively and yet remain within the context of gender-coded behavior. Typically, these victorious heroines are not yet married or are married but long separated from their husbands. But the conditional, derivative nature of such “independence” is revealed in the fact that all of these ex- ceptional women are fortunate in having fathers, suitors, or husbands who are unusual in their willingness to submit to the women’s judgments. As Euripides’ Medea notes, the rare woman who is lucky enough to have a good husband can find happiness; a woman not so lucky is condemned to a life of grief (see Chapter 17). But unlike Persephone, even if she finds marriage to be hell, she cannot return to her mother. The Heroine as Mother or As we might expect, the role of the heroine in Greek mythology reflects the role of women in Greek society. Thus, the most frequently occurring role of the heroine is that of the mother or wife of the hero, with variants as daughter/sister or concubine/ slave. As idealized in these roles as the male heroes are in theirs, the heroines are expected to be submissive, obedient, and loyal, no matter what—even willing to risk death to remain true to their husbands, just as their male counterparts were portrayed as willing to risk death to attain glory. Mothers and Daughters of the Heroes To be a mother of a hero, of course, one must first be the consort of a god. For the human mother of semidivine heroes, the experience of the divine raptus is the high point of their lives, and the consequences they suffer afterward are decidedly unpleas- ant. The most extreme example is Semele, impregnated by Zeus, who comes to her in human form. But when, goaded by Hera, she insists on making love to the god in his natural form (as lightning), she has a brief but electrifying experience and then, consumed by the fire of divine passion, goes up in smoke. Thus, Zeus has to rescue his son, who will become the incarnated god, Dionysus, and implant the fetus in his thigh (see Ghapter 13). In some versions, Semele is immortalized, but since what she wanted was not immortal life but divine love, that could hardly have consoled her. Those women who experience the divine passion in mediated form may survive the encounter, but their lives are no happier for it. Danae, for example, has her moment of bliss as she is inseminated by Zeus’s golden rain (Figure 10-16), but Ithough Zeus prevents Danae and the child Perseus from drowning, she is thereafter harassed by one man after another and must be repeatedly saved from potential rape by Perseus. In Euripides’ Heracleidae (the children of Heracles), both Heracles’ mother, Alcmene, and his children are endangered once the hero is no longer available to protect them, since Heracles’ old nemesis Eurystheus, who imposed the labors on the hero, seeks their death.

In this vase painting (c. 410 B.C.), Danae reclines on her couch, readying herself to receive Zeus’s shower of gold, which will engender the child (Louvre, Paris) ter, bravely volunteers to die, willing to sacrifice herself in order to save the city and her brothers. For this, she is praised as a truly heroic woman, a worthy daughter of her father. And while the rest of the family is eventually rescued through the divine intervention of the deified Fleracles and Fdebe, the message is clear: heroes are brave if they fight their enemies; heroines are brave if they sacrifice themselves. Wives of the Heroes The wives of the heroes fare no better. Ffecuba, queen and wife of Priam, king of Troy, as well as mother of Fiector, is taken into slavery when the city falls, as is Fiector’s wife, Andromache. In Euripides’ Trojan Women, Andromache laments that, the more she embodied the wifely virtues, the more she made herself attractive to the Greeks as a slave. She describes how she worked at being the most virtuous wife pos- sible—staying indoors, avoiding gossip, remaining quiet in her husband’s presence. In Euripides’ Andromache, she adds that, to please Hector, she joined him in admiring the women he had affairs with. She even went so far as to nurse Hector’s illegitimate chil- dren, outdoing Hera, goddess of marriage, herself, who in a similar situation refused to nurse Heracles. The result of such absolute loyalty to a man who insists on seeking glory on the battlefield, despite his awareness that his death will result in her enslavement (see Chapter 1 1 ) , is that her son is killed and she becomes the slave of Neoptolemus, son of Achilles, who killed her husband. She then finds herself in the same situation—she"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"Heroes and Heroines of Myth 301 and her child by Neoptolemus are threatened with death, and Neoptolemus himself is killed. Once again, the reward for the sacrifices she makes as a dutiful wife (or slave) is loss and death and the opportunity to continue to sacrifice. Heracles’ wife, Megara, experiences an even more calamitous end to her role as hero’s wife. Threatened by Lycus, who usurps Heracles’ rulership while the hero is in the Underworld, Megara (as depicted in Euripides’ Heracles) offers to die, along with her sons, to preserve her dignity. Her husband returns just in time to rescue his family, but almost immediately he goes mad and kills both Megara and their children. Once again, marriage to a hero proves deadly. Alcestis: The Model Wife The most extreme example, and the one held up as the ideal model of a loyal wife, is Alcestis. The eldest daughter of Pelias, king of lolcus, Alcestis is admired both for her virtue and for her beauty. She has so many suitors for marriage that her father resorts to a contest for the bride of the kind that abounds in fairy tales: to win her hand, a suitor must harness two wild beasts to a chariot. Aided by Apollo, Admetus succeeds in harnessing a lion and a boar, and so wins his bride. Admetus, ruler of Pherae, is a good man and an especially good host. When Apollo, forced to serve for a year as slave to a mortal as punishment for an offense to Zeus, was sent to serve Admetus, the latter refused to take advantage of the god’s position and treated him as an honored guest, thus endearing himself to the god. But despite his piety and the mutual love that Admetus and his new bride share, the marriage has a rather inauspicious beginning. It seems that Admetus, filled with grati- tude to Apollo, forgot to honor Artemis, who prepares young girls for adulthood and marriage. Artemis demonstrates her anger by filling the bridal chamber with snakes. And although Admetus, when informed of his omission, makes the requisite sacri- fices, the bride, in entering her marriage bed, has entered into the nightmare chasm of the Underworld, where the serpent goddess resides: in marriage, even to a virtuous and worthy man, every woman reenacts the experience of Persephone. vMcestis bears two children, but her happiness is cut short when Admetus falls ill and dies. According to various versions of the myth, Apollo either persuades Artemis or tricks the Fates (by getting them drunk) and thereby obtains permission to release Admetus from the Underworld, if a substitute can be found. In a reversal of the usual mythological pattern wherein the goddess, descending to the Underworld, wins re- lease by providing a substitute, usually her husband or consort (as in the Sumerian/ Babylonian myths of Inanna/Ishtar and Dumuzi/Tammuz, or its many variants, from the Egyptian Isis and Osiris to Aphrodite and Adonis in the Greek tradition), in this case it is vMcestis who dutifully offers herself as the substitute for her husband when his elderly parents refuse to sacrifice themselves. Alcestis willingly goes with Thanatos, god of death, to the Underworld, while her inconsolable husband mourns for her, although his love didn’t stop him from accept- ing her offer. Alcestis thus becomes in fact what she has been from the moment of her entry into the marriage chamber—indeed, from the moment she entered that chariot ominously yoked to wild beasts—like Persephone herself, a bride of Death. (Reinforcing the connection to Persephone, some scholars claim that Alcestis was at one time, early in the development of Greek culture, an Underworld goddess figure like Persephone at Pherae, with Admetus a version of Hades.)"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"302 The Myth ic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes Alcestis’s reenacting of Persephone’s experiences is completed when, in one version of the story, Persephone, sharing the admiration of the gods for Alcestis’s extreme devotion to her husband’s welfare, releases her, sending her back to her husband. In other versions, such as the one in Euripides’ Alcestis, it is Heracles, happening to arrive as a guest in Admetus’s house just as the funeral procession is taking place, who defeats Thanatos in a wrestling match and gains the power to resurrect his host’s dead wife. Thus, while both the hero Heracles and the heroine in their respective myths enter the Underworld and return, only he does so on his own powers, fighting with death (as he has done before); she depends on her male rescuer. And while Heracles, as a result of his Underworld journeys, has undergone a symbolic rebirth that will have its counterpart in his ascension to Olympus, Alcestis merely gets sent back to that same marriage chamber. Admetus is overjoyed to have his wife back. However, he is far more apologetic, in Euripides’ play, to Heracles for having, in his grief, neglected his duties as a host than he is to his wife for having accepted her offer in the first place. Alcestis’s own feelings about being returned to an ostensibly loving husband who let her dwell in the Underworld in his place aren’t addressed in the play. But she is held up forever after as a model wife—an example for all Greek wives to emulate. The Heroine us Help er-Mdiden Electra A variant of the heroine as wife or mother of the hero is the helper-maiden (who may or may not be the hero’s spouse, lover, or sister), whose role is to assist the hero in fulfilling his quest. Electra, for example, is credited with assisting her brother, Ores- tes, in getting revenge for the murder of their father, Agamemnon (see Chapter 15). In Aeschcylus’s Libation Bearers and Sophocles’ Electra, she is portrayed as encourag- ing her brother and assisting him in gaining access to the palace and the intended victims, their mother, Clytemnestra, and her lover, Aegisthus. When Orestes is driven mad and must go into exile, pursued by the Furies, Electra must, of course, be left behind. In Euripides’ version, the roles are almost reversed. Portrayed as hating her mother, Electra deceives Clytemnestra by pretending to be pregnant, in order to entrap her, and actually stabs Clytemnestra herself. Perhaps because she shares the role of “hero” here, and is not simply Orestes’ assistant, her reward is to be married to his friend Pylades. Medea Most helper-maidens end up in decidedly less pleasant circumstances. And they seem to multiply the risk if, having served as helper-maiden to the hero, they opt to become his wife or lover as well. Medea, for example, helps the Argonaut, Jason, obtain the Golden Fleece from the dragon that guards it, on the condition that he take her with him from the remote land of Colchis to Greece, as his wife. She continues to assist him to overcome the obstacles he encounters (for an extended discussion of Medea, see Chapter 17), but none of that prevents Jason from abandoning her for a younger, wealthier, and better-connected woman."},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"Heroes and Heroines of Myth 303 Ariadne Ariadne, daughter of King Minos of Crete, has a similar experience as helper-maiden. Having fallen in love with Theseus, Ariadne helps him by giving him instructions on how to kill the Minotaur and escape the labyrinth; like Medea, she does so on the condition that he take her with him afterward. But while Theseus succeeds, like Jason, thanks to her assistance, he does not reward her as promised. Having escaped with Ariadne and her younger sister, Phaedra, on board his ship, he abandons Ari- adne on the island of Naxos and marries Phaedra instead. In some versions of the myth, Ariadne commits suicide or dies of grief; in others (such as in Hesiod’s The- ogony), she marries the god Dionysus (or his priest). But though Hesiod describes her as being made immortal, as would be appropriate to the wife of a god, another version describes her as being killed by Artemis, perhaps for failing to preserve her chastity, or perhaps for violating a previous betrothal to Dionysus by making love to Theseus. Dionysus, in yet another version, turns her into a constellation, the Corona Borealis, when she dies, after the golden crown he gave her at their wedding. Despite the apparent contradictions of the variants of the myth, one fact remains constant—despite all Ariadne has done for him, out of love, Theseus leaves her. Athene, helper of heroes, is the model for the helper-maidens. But for Athene, self- contained virgin goddess and personification of divine wisdom, crossing the line be- tween helping heroes and loving them is never an issue. For the human women, the attraction of half-divine or at least divinely inspired men represents a temptation that few can resist, and Aphrodite supplants Athene. (In fact, some scholars claim that Ariadne was originally a Cretan goddess who was worshiped in many places, such as Cyprus, as Aphrodite-Ariadne.) Similarly, in Euripides’ Medea, Jason claims that Me- dea assisted him, not of her own accord, but under the spell of Aphrodite. And while, in various versions of the Ariadne myths, the motive for Artemis’s involvement is unclear, in mythic terms it is entirely appropriate: unable, like Callisto, to remain forever in Artemis’s band, a young woman must leave the remote country or pro- tected island where she grows up and, falling under the spell of Aphrodite, as Aph- rodite herself fell in love with Adonis, entrust herself to a man who will lead her either to happiness or to grief. In the case of the helper-maidens, it is all too often the latter. The Heroine as Hero-Impersonator Yet another type of heroine is the one who, not content with either being con- fined to the woods of her childhood with Artemis or being the victim of a hero- husband or lover, chooses instead an independent life. But since there are no so- cially acceptable avenues for achieving independence, for heroines who demand freedom from the restrictions of gender barriers but who do not choose to opt out of “normal” society and live in isolation from men, as the Amazons do, the only available models were the male heroes. These heroines seek to outdo the heroes at their own game. In a male-dominated world, however, such enterprises are doomed, and the heroines who choose to rebel against traditional gender restrictions are bound, sooner or later, either to yield to the inevitable and conform to social expec- tations or to self-destruct."},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"304 The Myth ic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes FIGURE 10-17 Atalanta and Peleus. In this vase painting (c. 530 B.C.), Atalanta wrestles with Peleus for the boars hide at the funeral games for Pelias. Although Peleus is one of the greatest heroes of his time, Atalanta wins the match. (Antikensammlungen, Munich) Atalanta Undoubtedly the most attractive, as well as the most successful, of such heroines is Atalanta. Atalanta combines the exceptional physical and martial prowess of the Amazons with the hunting skills of the followers of Artemis. In fact, in some versions, she is exposed to die at birth because her father wanted only sons but is nursed by she-bears and becomes a virgin huntress in the mode of Artemis’s followers. (Some scholars claim that there may actually have been two Atalantas who share the same skills and whose stories are conflated in the myths.) But unlike either the members of Artemis’s band or the Amazons, Atalanta does not eschew the company of men. In- stead, she challenges them, joining the heroes in their games and adventures. For example, in some versions, such as Ap olio dor us’s, she sails with the Argonauts and participates in the famous Calydonian boar hunt, in which the best Greek warriors kill a vicious boar sent by Artemis to destroy Calydon because its king, Oineus, forgot to sacrifice to her. Atalanta gets in the first shot, and Meleager, who finishes off the beast, gives her the hide. But his uncles, insulted that a woman is granted such an honor over themselves, go to war over it. (Several years ago, when a woman first successfully dove off an extremely high cliff in Mexico into shallow water beneath, an annual challenge that previously only men had attempted, a retired diver who had accomplished the same death-defying feat in his youth was quoted in American news- papers as saying, “If a woman can do it, what’s the point?” It is this same attitude that Atalanta confronts in Meleager’s uncles.) Atalanta also participates in the funeral games for Pelias (father of Alcestis and uncle of Jason), during which she engages in a wrestling match with the hero Peleus (father of Achilles) for the prize of a boar’s hide (or head) and wins the match (Figure 10-17)."},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"Heroes and Heroines of Myth 305 Atalanta seeks out challenges, and the men she contends with, unlike Meleager’s uncles, often find her intriguing and attractive, so she has many suitors. But Atalanta does not want to marry, for marriage would mean an end to her freedom. To forestall that dreaded fate, Atalanta, in the best-known tale of her exploits, sets up a rather unusual bride contest: she will race against each of her suitors; if he wins, she will marry him, but if he loses, he will forfeit his life. In some versions, she makes the challenge even more of an insult to the men: she will grant them a head start and will even run carrying weapons, thus handicapping herself still further. But if she over- takes the runner before he reaches the finish line, she will kill him herself on the spot. In other versions, the identity of the suitor varies—usually it is Hippomenes or Me- lanion—but the outcome remains the same. Hippomenes has three golden apples given to him by Aphrodite, and he carries these in the race. As he runs, he drops each of the apples in turn, and when Atalanta stops to pick them up, he wins the race— and a bride. Many young girls in our own time were raised on this story, presented (on records, tapes, and television) as a tale of “liberation”—of a strong woman free to set her own terms and conditions and to define her life as she chooses. But in ancient Greece, Atalanta and her peers enjoyed no such freedom. The choice (marriage or death) that she imposes on her suitors also applies to herself, and the she-bear who runs a race as a type of Artemis, in a version of the Brauronia, must succumb to Aphrodite and marry in the end. According to one tradition. Aphrodite, angry that Hippomenes forgot to thank her for the apples, sends such an overwhelming fit of desire to the pair that they make love right on the spot—in a temple to Zeus—and are turned into lions for that sacrilege. Thus, like Callisto, Atalanta the huntress becomes the hunted. But in another version, she has a child (by Meleager or Melanion) and becomes, after all, the mother she never intended to be. Either way, the possibility for a grown woman to preserve her independence without being killed or exiled from society alto- gether is nil. Agave Other rebellious heroines resort to more extreme measures in seeking the freedom and equality that society denies them. Of all the “rebel” heroines. Agave [a-GAY-vee] is the most extreme example of a woman who violates gender-role expectations to her own destruction. Driven mad by the god Dionysus (see Chapter 13), Agave, who has explicitly rejected the confinement of traditional female roles, tries to be Artemis and Heracles at once. After killing her son, Pentheus, who has spied on the mysteries of the god’s rites. Agave can only briefly sustain the illusion that the head of her son, which she brings back from the mountains, is indeed that of the “lion” she boasts of having killed with her bare hands—making her even braver, she declares, than men, who must use weapons. Ironically, in this grotesque parody of Heracles’ famous labor, she becomes more like that hero than she intended. After killing the Nemean lion, Heracles wore its skin and chose a club, rather than his bow, as his weapon, a fitting metamorphosis for a man who had already become a savage, killing his wife and children in a fit of madness also sent by a deity. In her “heroic” act of defiance."},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"306 The Myth ic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes Agave destroys all the real possibilities open to her as a woman: neither a virgin hunt- ress nor, any longer, a mother, she has no options left but madness and exile. Clytemnestra Clytemnestra [Klye-tem-NES-tra], Agamemnon’s wife, is another “rebel” heroine who consciously defies gender boundaries. In Aeschylus’s play Agamemnon, she is portrayed as living, while her husband has been absent for a decade prosecuting the war at Troy, the life of an independent, and even “professional,” woman, ruling the city of Argos in his place (see Chapter 15). Her daughter Iphigenia having been sacrificed by Agamemnon, Clytemnestra has no interest in being a mother to her other children: she has long since sent her son, Orestes, to live abroad, and she ignores her now-grown daughter, Electra. In fact, the role of mother seems not to have had much appeal for her. In Aeschylus’s play, the nurse comments that it was she, rather than Clytemnestra, who cared for Orestes as a baby. For ten years, Clytemnestra has ruled competently, albeit perhaps more firmly than the citizens would like. She has also taken a lover, Agamemnon’s cousin Aegis- thus, with whom she lives openly. And she has organized an efficient intelligence service—a network of spies and messengers to inform her about her husband’s re- turn. Not expecting decisive leadership from a woman, the old men of the city repeatedly describe her as behaving “like a man.” And, indeed, she does behave like a man—like any hero on the battlefield of Troy. When Agamemnon finally returns home, an enraged Clytemnestra stabs him with a sword, along with his slave and concubine Cassandra. When the murders are accomplished, she boasts of her deed, gloating over the fallen warrior just as Achilles and his peers did on the battlefield, proclaiming, “This is my work, and I claim it.” But behavior that is glorious for a man on the battlefield is monstrous for a woman in the palace. Although her action is no illusion, Clytemnestra can no more get away with being an Achilles than Agave can be a Heracles. When the battle of the sexes turns literal, she loses even if she wins. Of course, her son, Orestes, will have to avenge his father’s murder by killing her. And unlike Zeus’s intervention in Callisto’s experience, no god steps in to prevent that matricide: on the contrary, Apollo himself ordains it. When heroes like Achilles or Hector face death, they are consoled by the fact that, if they go down fighting, their names will be glorified and their deeds celebrated forever. In contrast, neither Clytemnestra nor Agave is reconciled to her fate. In Aeschylus’s Eumenides, Clytemnestra’s ghost is still arguing her case—futilely, of course—against Apollo and Athena, while Agave remains so alienated and enraged at Dionysus that, even in exile, she tries with equal futility to ambush the god himself.

Cassandra The Trojan princess Cassandra, a priestess of Apollo, has the misfortune to attract the erotic attentions of that god. When Cassandra rebuffs his advances, he gives her the gift of prophetic vision, hoping to win her over, but she does not yield, holding him off instead with vague promises of future satisfaction. As Apollo’s prophet, Cassandra becomes the oracle, the medium through which the divine com- municates with the human. But the price Apollo demands is that she accept the divine raptus. To be the consort of a god carries risks, as the fate of Semele shows. Indeed, Cassandra is doomed whether she accepts or rejects the divine consumma- tion. Determined to preserve her chastity, she denies the god and, as punishment, is driven mad, so that no one believes her prophecies. Thus, though she accurately foretells the doom of Troy, her predictions are dismissed as lunatic ravings. In her enforced inability to share her vision or be believed or taken seriously, Cassandra is in the same position as every Greek woman. Andromache, for example, in the Iliad, gives her husband Hector sound strategic advice and also predicts with complete accuracy her own fate and that of their child if Hector ignores her advice and consequently dies in battle. But she is dismissed and sent back to her weaving, her admittedly sound but “womanly” voice not heeded. Having relinquished her power as an oracle and refused the hieros gamos (sacred marriage) with Apollo, Cassandra is left to the world of human men, where her at- tempt to preserve her chastity is in any case futile. When her prophecies prove true and Troy falls, she is raped by Aias on the altar of Athene, an ironic commentary on her attempt to be, as oracle, a variant of the virgin goddess of divine wisdom. Cassan- dra is brought to Greece as Agamemnon’s slave (according to some versions, along with the two sons she bore him), where she is slain by Glytemnestra. In Aeschylus’s play, Cassandra laments her tragic predicament: having refused to be the bride of Apollo, she must become instead the bride of Death. Although her death is literally unavoidable, her final act is one she consciously chooses, wresting out of the hands of fate the only kind of freedom still possible: she rejects her role as prophet of the god whose visions have enslaved her. Entering the palace to confront the death she knows awaits her, Cassandra demonstrates the same heroic acceptance and determination to go forward that heroes manifest when facing death on the battlefield. Iphigenia Iphigenia [if-ih-jeh-NYE-a], daughter of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra, finds her- self likewise trapped and also chooses death, both for patriotic reasons and as a literal substitute for marriage. When Agamemnon decides to sacrifice her to the goddess Artemis, in order, he believes, for the Greek armada assembled at Aulis to be permit- ted to sail for Troy, he sends for her, under the pretence that he is going to marry her"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"308 The Myth ic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes to Achilles. When she arrives, according to Euripides’ Iphigenia atAulis, expecting to be married to the greatest living hero, she discovers her father’s true intention. Her mother, Clytemnestra, is appalled and prevails on Achilles, who knew nothing of the arrangements, to prevent the tragedy. Iphigenia herself, however, accepts her death, a willing sacrifice. Arguing that one man is worth more than ten thousand women, Iphigenia offers her body to Artemis, for “Hellas.” The taking of Troy, she declares, will be her marriage and her children. Achilles, in turn, praises her for her nobility. Wearing garlands and sprinkled with holy water, she goes to the altar of death that should have been the altar of marriage, singing the praises of Artemis. In some versions of the myth, the sacrifice is carried out; but in Euripides’ play, a deer is miraculously substituted for the girl, who is spirited away by Artemis. In Euripides’ Iphigenia among the Taurians, we next find her as a priestess of Artemis, isolated in a savage land and presiding over gruesome, bloody rites of human sacrifice. It is a place of death, a kind of Underworld, where all strangers are slain as offerings to the goddess. When her brother, Orestes, and his friend Pylades arrive there, Iphi- genia’s prior situation is reversed—now her brother is the intended victim of the goddess, and his sister the rescuer. But although she manages to save the pair and succeeds in sailing off with them to Greece, clearly there will be no marriage for her. Iphigenia complains of her life without husband or children and without the usual feminine occupations such as weaving, symbol of the connected web of life; she re- grets that, as priestess of Artemis, she is denied the opportunity to make offerings to Hera, goddess of marriage. Recollecting the horror of Aulis, she insists that her father married her to Hades, rather than to Achilles. She has been the bride of Death and guardian of the gateway to the Underworld but has, in fact, been denied the consum- mation even of that “marriage.” At the end of Euripides’ play, Athene appears and decrees that Iphigenia will re- turn to Greece and establish a temple to Artemis at Brauron. According to the play, Athene then “charters” the Brauronia. She declares that a priest will put a knife to a man’s throat and draw blood, a symbolic sacrifice in compensation for Iphigenia’s life. In a reversal of Alcestis’s story, the “sacrificed” men are substitutes for Iphigenia in the Underworld, allowing her to be restored to life. Iphigenia herself will become the Keeper of the Keys of the feminine mysteries, guardian of the rituals at Brauron at which young girls are initiated. But while the girls, after running as she-bears in Artemis’s ritual, go on to follow the path of Per- sephone— they reach puberty, marry, and, like Demeter, have children—Iphigenia herself will have no such life. She will die and be buried, Athene says, at Brauron. And the garments of women who die in childbirth (in other words, who are sacrificed to Artemis, goddess of childbirth) will be consecrated as offerings to Iphigenia, standin for the virgin goddess. In effect frozen in time, a grown woman fixated at the stage before puberty, Iphigenia is condemned to remain perpetually unfulfilled. The Victorious Heroines Among all these women who suffer either because of or despite their strengths, one small group of heroines stands out. These are the lucky few who manage to retain"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"Heroes and Heroines of Myth 309 their independence and yet remain within the context of gender-coded behavior as proper helper-maidens, wives or daughters to the heroes, or consorts to the gods. Nausicaa Daughter of King Alcinuous and Queen Arete of Scheria, the princess Nausicaa [na- SIK-ay-a] meets the hero Odysseus, in Homer’s epic, after his last adventure in the supernatural world (see Chapter 12). Crossing the sea from Calypso’s island on a raft and nearly drowning, Odysseus at last drags himself ashore and falls asleep. When he awakens, Nausicaa and her handmaidens are playing ball on the beach while waiting for their laundry to dry. When Odysseus—naked, hair matted, and covered with brine—crawls out from under a bush and approaches them, the young women scream and flee. Only Nausicaa stands her ground. When he greets her, he compares her to Artemis, thus reassuring her that he both admires her beauty and respects her virginity. Offering him a cloak and inviting him to the palace, Nausicaa as helper- maiden sets in motion the event that represents the culmination of Odysseus’s jour- ney, his return to Ithaca, for her father will eventually arrange for the hero’s safe transportation home. Despite her youth and unmarried state, Nausicaa is neither shy nor naive. She demonstrates her sophisticated awareness when she insists that Odysseus go to the palace separately, apart from herself and her maids, to prevent the townspeople from gossiping about the disreputable-looking man the princess picked up on the beach. Clearly, this courageous, intelligent, and witty young woman finds Odysseus attrac- tive, as he finds her. But unlike other helper-maidens, she assists him simply because he is a human being in need, and “wanderers and beggars come from Zeus,” as she says, without attaching herself to him as a condition. She does not initiate an erotic relationship with him, nor he with her. Attractive as she is, Odysseus is by this time in his travels beyond any temptation—he wants only to return to his wife. As a result, Odysseus and Nausicaa are free to engage in subtle flirtation and to give and receive help with no disastrous consequences to either party. When the king generously offers Odysseus a ship full of treasure and free passage home if he wants to leave, and half his kingdom and his daughter if he wants to stay, Odysseus chooses to go, wishing Nausicaa “wedded bliss”—with someone else. Of course, in a patriarchal society, her father still has the right to give her to any man of his choice. But perhaps King Alcinuous has noticed his daughter’s affinity for their heroic visitor and will respect such preferences in a future choice of son-in-law as well. And because Nausicaa has remained self-possessed and emotionally detached and, unlike Ariadne, has not thrown herself at the first hero who comes ashore on the island of her childhood, she can accept Odysseus’s parting blessing in the generous spirit in which it was given. She will undoubtedly, one imagines, choose her own mate wisely when she is ready. Penelope Combining the roles of helper-maiden with those of the ideal wife and mother, Odysseus’s wife Penelope, as described in Homer’s Odyssey, is far more than the model of patience and loyalty, the traits for which she is usually (and properly)"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"310 The Myth ic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes acclaimed. Of course, as devoted wife of the hero and mother to their son Telema- chus, Penelope manifests those ideal qualities far beyond what social convention would have required. Her husband has been gone for twenty years: ten years fighting the war at Troy and, in effect, “missing in action” for the following ten years. Unlike Alcmene or Megara, though, Penelope is not a helpless victim waiting to be rescued. Legally permitted to remarry after such an interval, she persists in her determination to wait, hoping that her husband will somehow make it home. But her determination reflects not a sense of duty or piety, but rather her real love for Odysseus, just as his determination to return to her motivates his own increasingly desperate journey (see Chapter 12). Surrounded by one hundred rowdy “suitors” who have taken over her home and attempted to assassinate her son, Penelope has for a year postponed acting on their demand that she “choose” one of them by pretending to weave a shroud for her elderly father-in-law, as her last duty to Odysseus’ family, but secretly unraveling most of her work each night. As a weaver, she is aligned with the life-maintaining goddess, weaver of the web of life: she daily weaves to keep her hope—and her marriage— alive and nightly unweaves the shroud of death, as if to keep it at bay that much longer. Appropriately, it is Athene, goddess of weaving, who inspires Penelope to devise the trick of unweaving the shroud. But Athene is also protector of heroes and goddess of the defensive war that saves the home. On both grounds, she clearly has an interest in reuniting Odysseus’s family. That Penelope’s divine patron is not Arte- mis but Athene, who combines masculine and feminine principles, aligns the heroine with the wisdom of Zeus in its feminine manifestation, effectively combining animus and anima. It is precisely that combination that enables Penelope not only to outwit the suit- ors, and thus make Odysseus’s return possible, but also to function as his helper- maiden when at last he does return, disguised as a beggar, to Ithaca. While many readers suspect that she recognizes him right away, she does not reveal his identity, for to do so would probably mean his death at the suitors’ hands. As if to emphasize that recognition and the incredible self-restraint required of her, Homer shows in- stead the old nurse, Eurycleia, as she recognizes Odysseus and swears to keep his identity secret—unless, perhaps, she tells Penelope. If Penelope has indeed recog- nized him, from this point on, Odysseus’s survival depends on his wife’s behavior. Thus, she is, in effect, in control—and, significantly, Odysseus accepts his subordi- nation. If, however, she has not yet recognized him, his victory is still dependent on her next moves. Penelope as helper-maiden assists the hero by courageously arranging a mock “bride contest” among the suitors: the famous “test of the bow.” She takes a real risk here—the bow in the wrong hands could mean disaster, so she must trust Odysseus implicitly just as he does her. Knowing that no one but Odysseus could either string the hero’s marvelous weapon or use it the way he could, with near-miraculous preci- sion, and trusting that his skills after all this time are still functional, she manages to remove the weapon from the storeroom so that Odysseus can get his hands on it. Thus, with his wife’s assistance, the hero is armed for the inevitable battle. Without ever needing to communicate directly, this equally heroic pair instinctively act as a team. Once all the suitors have been killed, Penelope reserves a final test for Odysseus"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"Heroes and Heroines of Myth 311 himself. But unlike Atalanta, Penelope uses the test to strengthen, rather than to avoid, her marriage. Ostensibly an identity check, the test determines whether Odys- seus is still the loving husband who sailed off to war twenty years ago and whether, therefore, he deserves to have her back. Thus, she challenges Odysseus to reveal the secret sign of their marriage bed, the culminating point of both of their journeys. Unlike Alcestis’s marriage chamber, the bedroom of Odysseus and Penelope is no chamber of snakes. Perhaps because, unlike most of her peers, Penelope was neither abducted nor given away to a stranger—her marriage to Odysseus was a love match from the start—there is no aura of the Underworld here. On the contrary, it is the Tree of Life that grows in their bedroom. In Homer’s epic, Odysseus describes how he constructed the bed, carving the first bedpost from a living olive tree still rooted in the earth, making the others to match, and then weaving a bed of oxhide thongs between them. In a complete reversal of standard construction techniques, Odysseus built the bed first, and then constructed the room around the bed and the rest of his home around the bedroom, making the marriage chamber the center of his very existence. And not only did he build the bed with his own hands (a rather unusual action for a king, even of a small island), but he wove the oxhide thongs himself as well. Thus, just as Penelope has heroically held off one hundred suitors by herself during his absence, Odysseus has been a weaver, and, like his wife, he has, without violating gender roles, combined animus and anima to create a marriage that is enduring, mutually sustaining, and capable of surviving change and growth. It is not surprising, then, that Odysseus’s attitude toward domestic life reverses that of conventional he- roes like Heracles or Hector, or that he has literally turned down the unattainable gift they died for—immortality—in order to have what they could have had all along but rejected or destroyed—a happy marriage. Psyche Of all the Greek heroines, perhaps the most remarkable is Psyche. The myth of Eros and Psyche is sometimes interpreted as an allegory of the relationship between the soul (Psyche, whose name means both “soul” and “butterfly,” ancient symbol of the Goddess as source of spiritual transformation) and the divine (the god Eros), in which marriage represents the mystical union of the soul with the deity. The tale also weaves together strands from all the patterns of the mythic heroine’s experience. As Heracles is the archetypal hero. Psyche is the archetypal heroine. Possessing unearthly beauty. Psyche is taken to be a goddess, a second Aphrodite, and is worshiped accordingly, arousing the fury of Aphrodite herself, presented in Apuleius’s tale (the earliest narrative source for this story) as the creator goddess. Psyche is distressed by this behavior, since as a result she has no suitors, while her older sisters, of merely ordinary attractiveness, are already married. Aphrodite is en- raged that a mere mortal girl should receive the prayers and offerings that are due to the goddess. She sends her son Eros (called by his Latin name, Gupid, in Apuleius’s version) to cause Psyche to fall in love with the vilest man possible. But Eros falls in love with her himself and craves her for his own bride. When an oracle tells Psyche’s father that she must be married to a monstrous dragon, she is led, in a procession that is both marriage rite and funeral, to a high"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"312 The Myth ic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes mountain crag, and abandoned to be the bride of Death. Alone and about to plunge into a chasm from which, like Persephone, she can never emerge in the same state. Psyche is every bride. Then, as in a fairy tale (such as “Beauty and the Beast”), Psyche awakens to find herself in a magnificent palace, where she is waited on by invisible servants. Every night her husband, whom she does not know to be the god Eros, comes to her in the dark, and she is forbidden to look on him, on pain of losing him forever. Thus, Psyche, like Persephone, has become the queen of a luxurious netherworld kingdom. But unlike Persephone, she is a mortal, not a goddess, and like Semele, she cannot look on the face of her divine consort directly. Like Semele, too, she conceives a divine child who, Eros tells her, will be a god if she makes no attempt to see her husband but a mortal if she should ever see him. Psyche accepts the arrangement, but her jealous sisters tell her that she is married to a monster and convince her not only to look on him (as Hera tricked Semele) but to kill him. With heroic courage. Psyche uncovers a lantern and, like every hero confronting a dragon, is about to cut his head off when she sees the sleeping god. Awed at the divine presence, she touches the tip of his arrow, pricks her finger, and thus falls passionately in love with Eros. At that moment, pricking her own finger and falling in love with the god she clearly sees, she experiences mature love, indepen- dently given, rather than accepted blindly as the condition of her marriage, as would be the case for any girl married off to a stranger in the usual way. Psyche, in contrast, has become the aggressor, not the victim. In fact, Apuleius says that she “becomes a man” at that moment. And Eros is wounded, not just in his shoulder by a drop of oil from her lantern, but in his self-serving premise that it is necessary to keep his bride in the dark. Thus far, he has used her to satisfy his own desires, and although he has kept her housed and fed in luxury, the couple have no relationship at all: “love” as an erotic fantasy or as a housekeeping arrangement is not enough. Awakened by the pain of the oil burning his shoulder, Eros leaves, flying up into the heavens, with Psyche clinging to him, until she drops back to earth. Like Pandora, she has seen the divine secret and suffers a fall. But whereas heroes like Actaeon suffered death for seeing the beauty of Aatemis too directly, Eros is a gentler god, and Psyche does not die. Unsuccessful in a suicide attempt. Psyche goes searching for her husband, who is at his mother’s house, suffering from his wound. Still angry. Aphrodite now imposes a series of labors on Psyche, the only heroine to go on a quest like that of the male heroes. Like Odysseus, the goal of whose labors is a return to Penelope, Psyche’s labors will bring about her reunion with Eros. But where the heroes are helped by gods (or helper-maidens). Psyche is assisted by nature. Her first task is to sort an immense heap of various grains, which she does with the help of the ants—another folk- and fairy-tale motif. Her second task is reminis- cent of Jason’s—to bring back some of the golden fleece of wild sheep who attack humans, driven into a frenzy by the heat of the sun. Instructed by a reed by the river bank. Psyche waits until the sheep are asleep to gather the wool that clings to the twigs in the grove. Psyche’s third and fourth tasks are akin to those of Heracles himself. Ordered to bring back water from the high mountain stream that is the source of the rivers of the Underworld, an inaccessible height guarded by fierce dragons, she is assisted by the eagle of Zeus himself, who honors Eros by helping his bride, in memory of having"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"Heroes and Heroines of Myth 313 brought Ganymede to Zeus. For her last labor, Psyche must venture into the Under- world and bring back in a casket a small portion of Persephone’s beauty to present to Aphrodite. Psyche understands that she is being sent to her death. Mounting a tower to try again to commit suicide, she hears the tower itself instruct her on how to enter the Underworld, taking two coins (for Charon, the ferryman) and two barley cakes (for Cerberus, the hound of Hades). To succeed, she will need to resist the temptation to open the casket that Persephone will give her. Once again, the Pandora theme enters the story as curiosity overwhelms Psyche. On returning to the upper world, she opens the casket and falls into a deathlike sleep. Here again, myth and fairy tale converge as Psyche becomes a “sleeping beauty”; as in the fairy tale, meaningful life is suspended until her marriage. Having recovered, meanwhile, Eros locates his bride and awakens her with a prick of one of his arrows. He puts sleep back into the casket, in effect burying the adolescent girl, who experi- ences rebirth as a mature woman. Psyche has emerged from the cocoon of uncon- sciousness and become the butterfly. Like Eros, she now has her own wings. When Psyche awakens, it is to accept her mature role as wife. With animus and anima now joined, the relationship of Eros and Psyche resembles that of Odysseus and Penelope, except that Eros is divine and Psyche is mortal. To make the couple more compatible, Zeus gives Psyche a drink of the nectar of the gods and immortalizes her, and the marriage is formalized at last. Psyche and Eros, like Heracles and Hebe, will be mar- ried for all eternity. But unlike Heracles, Psyche has achieved transfiguration through love, not war, and the divine child who is born to Psyche is called Pleasure. As a heroine myth, the story of Psyche contains all the possibilities, but as for Psyche herself, there is none like her.

In what ways is Perseus similar to Heracles and Theseus? In what ways is he different? Discuss the ways in which their semidivine natures influence their adventures, their relationships with women, and their political affairs, as well as their status after death. 2. For the heroes of Greek myths, the ultimate adventure is going to the Underworld and coming back alive. Why do Heracles and Theseus go to the Underworld? How does the quest help them achieve the immortality they desire? 3. The standard pattern of the heroic rite of passage includes the hero’s separation from his normal environment, his initiation or encounter with supernatural forces, and his return bearing some new understanding to share with the members of his community. Choose a significant example from the adventures of Perseus, Heracles, and Theseus, and explain how each follows this pattern. In each case, what new understanding does the hero achieve? 4. Does Jason also undergo a rite of passage? Explain what elements of Jason’s adventures fit the archetypal pattern of separation and initiation.

The Troy Saga KEY TOPICS / THEMES At the wedding ofPeleus and Thetis, the uninvited goddess of discord, Eris, tosses a golden apple. When three goddesses fight over it, Zeus throws it off Mount Olympus. It is found by Paris, prince of Troy, who gives it to the goddess Aphrodite in return for her promise of the love of the most beautiful woman in the world. That woman is Helen, wife ofMenelaus. When she runs off to Troy with Paris, the Greeks and Trojans go to war. The myth of the Trojan War may recall a historical military encounter. According to the myth, after a ten-year siege, Troy is destroyed by Odysseus’s trick of the Trojan Horse. In the Iliad, Homer tells of a quarrel between the general Agamemnon and the hero Achilles in the Greek camp in the ninth year of the war. The Decision of Paris The story of the judgment (or decision) of Paris is seminal to the study of Greek mythology, not only because it is the seed from which so many myths arise, but also because it is a paradigm of the complex world in which those myths reside. The story involves a minor sea goddess, Thetis, and a mortal man, Peleus, who are about to wed. Zeus, it seems, has heard a prophecy, perhaps revealed by Prometheus in ex- change for his freedom, that a child of his, possibly by Thetis, will one day usurp his throne. To prevent such a threat, Zeus marries off Thetis, to whom he is sexually attracted, to a human prince, guaranteeing that any child of hers will be half-human and thus no threat to his divinity. Or perhaps Zeus is simply punishing her, as one variant account suggests, for refusing, out of loyalty to Hera, who raised her, to yield to his sexual advances; or perhaps, according to yet another variant, he is rewarding Peleus for his uncommon valor. 315"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"316 The Myth ic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes FIGURE 11'l The Judgment of Paris. This Roman bas-relief from the Casali Altar shows Paris (seated, top right) negotiating with the three goddesses—Athene (left), Hera (center), and Aphrodite (right, shown partially disrobed)—while Hermes holds the golden apple that he has delivered to the Trojan prince. (Vatican Museums, Rome) Zeus invites to the wedding all the gods and goddesses except one— Eris, the goddess of strife, or discord. Naturally, she arrives uninvited and tosses at the as- sembled guests a golden apple bearing the inscription “For the fairest.” Three goddesses—Hera, Athene, and Aphrodite—quarrel over the apple. Deter- mined to preserve harmony, Zeus throws the apple down off Mount Olympus. It lands in a field outside Troy, where Paris, son of King Priam of Troy, is tending sheep. Picking up the apple, Paris is startled by the sudden appearance of the three god- desses, each of whom asks for it, offering him a gift in exchange (see Color Plate 6). Hera, queen of the gods, offers power over all of Asia Minor, but Paris will one day inherit his father’s kingdom, so he turns her down. Athene offers wisdom, but, like many young men, Paris is sure that he already possesses all the wisdom he needs. Aphrodite offers the love of the most beautiful woman in the world, and, to a young man whose only company is a flock of sheep, she clearly wins the prize (Figure 11- 1). The goddesses, one exultant, the other two enraged, disappear—perhaps it was a dream. Paris goes back to his sheep. Shortly thereafter. King Priam calls for his son, now old enough to assume some political responsibilities, and sends him on his first diplomatic mission—to the home of Menelaus [men-e-LAY-uhs], king of Sparta. Or perhaps, prompted by Aphrodite, he chooses on his own to go. Menelaus’s wife, Helen, is the most beautiful woman in the world because of her half-divine parentage. She is the daughter of a mortal woman, Leda, and Zeus, who appeared to Leda (who would not betray her husband, Tyndareus, with another man) in the form of a great white swan. In another variant, Paris already knows of Helen’s beauty and goes to Sparta intending to kidnap her."},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"Heroes at War 317 While Paris is a guest in Menelaus’s home, Menelaus leaves for a brief trip of his own. Left alone with Helen, Paris seduces her. Or perhaps he abducts her, along with some of Menelaus’s treasure, and returns to Troy. When, despite official protests, Paris refuses to return Helen, Priam feels honor-bound to defend his son, though it means war with Menelaus. The latter, however, has many powerful allies: when Tyndareus, Helen’s supposed father, was ready to marry her off, he summoned all the heroes— the princes of noble families—as potential suitors. Before announcing his choice, Tyndareus made them all swear to support Helen’s husband should he ever call on their aid. Thus begins the Trojan War —ten years of death and chaos, consequences of a bad choice. The Historicity O' Troy One of the most important sets of myths in the corpus of Greek mythology, the saga of Troy may also have at least one of its roots in actual history. The ancient Greeks certainly thought so: Herodotus, for example, discusses Troy very early in his Histo- ries, treating that war as the source of the continuing animosity between Greeks and “Asians” (specihcally, the Persians). Modern scholars, similarly, have reason to believe that the Iliad has at least some loose basis in actual historical events. Situated at the entrance to the Hellespont, the narrow sea link between the Medi- terranean and the Black Sea, Troy occupied a highly strategic location. Modern ex- cavations have revealed a wealthy city of long standing, with some of its affluence possibly the result of exacting taxes from merchant ships passing through this critical seagoing trade route between East and West. And archaeological evidence attests that, somewhere around 1250 B.C., Troy VII-A was looted and burned by unidentified aggressors, possibly after a long siege. Even if those unknown aggressors were Greek, the exact nature of the conflict that may have occurred between the Trojans and the Mycenaean city-states is likewise unknown. Various theories include a feud over a dynastic marriage (Herodotus re- marks that only the Greeks would be stupid enough to go to such lengths to fight to retrieve a woman); the pressure of migrations and/or invasions by the Dorians, an- other Greek-speaking people entering the region at the time; a population explosion in mainland Greece that was unsupportable by the local economy; or a wave of mi- grations and/or raids prompted by that same struggling economy. Until recently, excavations at Troy had uncovered a series of cities destroyed and rebuilt on the site, all of them far too small to have withstood a protracted siege such as the myths and Homer’s epic describe. But more recent excavations have revealed a much larger outer wall, and thus a city far more extensive than previously believed to exist (see Chapter 1). Furthermore, while scholars had previously noted that Troy is not near enough to the coast either to pose a serious threat to ships passing through the Hellespont or to fit the description of the field of war as Homer describes it (with the Greeks encamped on the beach and the battlefield between them and the city gates), very recent geological studies have revealed that the current landscape is sig- nificantly different from what it was in the Bronze Age, when the coastline was indeed much closer to the city than is now the case. Thus, while we have no definitive knowledge of the actual nature of the historical link between Troy and Mycenaean Greece, we have every reason to accept some basis of historicity in the legends."},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"318 The Mythic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes The Implications o the Story Among the most popular bodies of material in Greek mythology, the stories that make up the saga of Troy are retold in numerous variations by many writers. Among the most important narrative sources for the pre- and post-//zW materials are Apol- lodorus s Library, Ovid’s Metamorphoses, and various works by unknown writers, of- ten fragments, collectively referred to as the “Epic Cycle” (among them the Cypria and the Little Iliad), as well as Hyginus’s Tabulae. Examples of the many dramatic sources include plays by Aeschylus (the Oresteid), Euripides {Lphigenia at Aulis; Lphi- genia among the Taurians; Orestes; Trojan Women), and Sophocles [Aias; Philoctetes). The alternative versions of parts of the story of the judgment of Paris and the endless sequels—including the sacrifice of Agamemnon’s daughter lphigenia, the destruction of Troy, the death of Achilles, the murder of Agamemnon and Orestes’ revenge, and the wanderings of Odysseus, as well as many other tales—reflect the multiform and open-ended nature of Greek myths. Such a complex network of overlapping but often contradictory tales inevitably prompts us to ask where the saga of Troy truly begins: is it with Paris’s judgment, with Zeus’s rape of Leda (as the modern Irish poet W. B. Yeats asserts—see Chapter 21), or with the genesis of a universe that, as Hesiod describes it in the Theogony, emerges out of chaos at its inception? The beginning and end of the story of the decision of Paris are obscured in the mysteries of the creation and destruction of the universe itself. The Timelessness of Myth The myths occur in a timeless world, or at least they refuse to submit to the tests of human chronology and logic. Consider, for example, Achilles [a-KJE-leez], the child born of the marriage of Peleus and Thetis. Goddesses, like human females, apparently carry their offspring for nine months. Presumably, then, Achilles is born within a year of the marriage. If, meanwhile, Paris’s embassy to Menelaus begins several months after the incident of the apple and lasts for a year, and even if it takes, as the myths attest, a year for the Greeks to assemble their troops and another for the armada to set sail for Troy, then Achilles would have been two years old when the war began and twelve when it ended. According to some variants, Helen and Paris spent a ten- year honeymoon on Crete before returning to Troy, but even that interval would have made Achilles twelve years old at the start of the war—still too young for the experiences attributed to him. Before the war starts, Achilles is already the Greeks’ most renowned hero and was one of the suitors for Helen’s hand before her marriage to Menelaus. And before the war is over, Achilles’ son, Neoptolemus, is old enough to join the battle and become a hero in his own right. No reasonable computation can make sense of these numbers in terms of human time. We may ask the questions, but the myth, in its own timeless realm, refuses to address them. ConPict in Society and the Cosmos On a social level, Zeus, god of family love and of guest-host relationships, sanctifies values that preserve the sacred institution of marriage, harmony within families, and civilized modes of social and political exchange that maintain order. This larger cos-"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"Heroes at War 319 mic perspective is reflected in political terms in the emerging concept of the Greeks as a nation, witnessed in the Iliad, as scholars have noted, in the collective names by which the Greeks refer to themselves: Hellenes, Danaans, Argives, Achaeans. Paris, making off with Menelaus’s wife while a guest in the Spartan kings home, violates these god-ordained relationships. But personal and familial loyalty are also important under the older kinship system, in which the clan is the source of security, values, and justice. When Priam, believing that honor and family love oblige him to stand behind his son despite his poor judgment, refuses to abide by the prevailing social norms, adhering instead to loyalty to the clan, the two systems clash. In a world already in transition, the crisis forces these two systems into open conflict, releasing the aggressions that all such social systems usually manage to keep in check. The veneer of civilized life is stripped away, and the world is plunged into war. It is not just social structures that can change. The cosmos itself in which the myth occurs is dynamic: although Zeus’s regime appears stable, there are recurrent hints, however obscure, that it will not be eternal. Change is given in the nature of things, and not even the immortal gods rule forever. The powers of the gods in this cosmos, furthermore, are limited. Zeus is in command but not in control of the universe. He cannot by fiat decree discord nonexistent: evil exists, and Zeus, like the rest of us, must cope with it. The disharmony in the human world, moreover, is both a consequence and a reflection of the disharmony in a cosmos at war with itself The Trojan War, like the war between the Titans and the Olympians, reflects an ambigu- ous and contradictory universe in which, as Hesiod pointed out, a mixture of good and evil is the best one can hope for. The Human and the Divine The myth of the decision of Paris also depicts, in terms characteristic of Greek my- thology, the conjunction of the human and the divine. So closely connected are the two—the gods so like humans, the humans so godlike—that marriage is possible between them. But such marriages are fraught with difficulties: although they remain amicable, Peleus and Thetis soon separate—they may love each other, but they fail to understand each other. Thetis, attempting to erase the father’s human taint from her child, dips Achilles in the divine fire (or water), holding him by the heel. For all her efforts, though, she cannot erase his paternal inheritance: “Achilles’ heel” is the human condition. Meanwhile, Peleus, terrified that Thetis’s efforts will destroy his son, attempts unsuccessfully to stop her. They are clearly incompatible and must carry on their lives on separate planes. The gods, furthermore, lack the power either to control human nature or to com- pel human fate: Thetis can neither make Achilles immortal nor prevent him from going to Troy. Thus, within the limits of mortality, humans have the freedom to act: just as Paris freely chooses to give the apple to Aphrodite, so Achilles freely chooses to go to Troy; and both must accept responsibility for their fates. Indeed, Paris, dan- gling an apple over the heads of three goddesses, already has, in a way perhaps even he does not understand, more power than Hera can offer him. The myth of the decision of Paris suggests a universe of infinite, though ambigu- ous, options; it offers humans the freedom to choose, but no guarantees or clear-cut guides. Paris chooses love, sacrificing power and wisdom: could he have chosen bet- ter? Would raw power, unguided by wisdom or love, have been a better choice? Or"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"320 The Mythic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes an abstract wisdom, untempered by love and lacking the power to act? Choosing love, Paris defines himself, as do Achilles and Hector when they choose to fight (and die) for glory. Each lives the life and death he has chosen. For all its trappings of prophecies and oracles, Greek mythology depicts in the story of the decision of Paris a world of human freedom and moral responsibility, where every choice is fraught with awe and terror and every life contains the possibilities at once for transcendence and for tragedy. The Trojdn Cycle Continues; Events Preceding the llidd The Gathering of the Troops When Menelaus calls up his allies, the most powerful Greek princes and their troops, led by Menelaus s brother, Agamemnon, begin gathering at the port of Aulis. Only two, Odysseus [oh-DIS-ee-uhs] and Achilles, fail to appear. Odysseus is married to Helen’s cousin Penelope, who has recently given birth to their son, Telemachus. Devoted to his family, Odysseus is reluctant to leave them when the call to arms comes. When Agamemnon’s ambassadors arrive, Odysseus pre- tends to be insane, but when they test him by placing the baby in front of the plow he is driving, Odysseus immediately acts to save his son, thus revealing the pretense. Once committed to the war effort, however, Odysseus becomes the most loyal officer and the prime strategist and morale builder of the Greek troops. Odysseus’s first assignment is to locate and recruit the missing Achilles. In a des- perate attempt to protect her son from the prophecy that he would perish if he par- ticipated in the Trojan War, Thetis insisted that he hide on the island of Scyros, disguised as a girl. Disguising himself in turn as a merchant, Odysseus travels to Scyros and displays before the local women an assortment of beautiful garments and one suit of armor. While the women examine the dresses, Achilles’ attention is im- mediately drawn to the armor. Thus found out, Achilles comes willingly. The Events at Aulis With the armada assembled at Aulis, the goddess Artemis, perhaps angered by Aga- memnon’s boast that his skill at hunting exceeded hers, causes the winds to die down, thus preventing the ships from embarking for Troy. When he appeals to the gods for some clue as to how to proceed, Agamemnon is informed by the prophet Calchas that he must sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia (see Chapters 10 and 15). Only then do the ships set sail. The war on Troy, intended to save a family, begins by destroying one, and the effort is tainted from the start. The War Begins While the Greeks have been gathering their troops and awaiting the invasion, the Trojans have been gathering allies of their own. When the Greeks, after taking some outlying cities, land on the beaches at Troy, they find a city whose walls are impreg- nable and whose many allies prevent the Greeks from creating a total blockade. The river Scamander also runs through the city, providing an abundant water supply. A"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"Heroes at War 321 well-fortified city whose lifelines of food and water are secure can wait out even the longest siege, and thus the Trojans are in no immediate danger. If they choose to stay inside the walls, they are safe; if they choose to come out and fight, they have a safe retreat nearby. The Greeks, meanwhile, in a temporary encampment far from home, are at a strategic and psychological disadvantage. For nine years, the Greek troops remain camped on the beaches. Battles are fought, men are killed, prisoners are taken and held or ransomed, but the war itself remains stalemated, the Trojans unable to drive the Greeks from their shores and the Greeks unable to breach the walls and take the city. The level of frustration is high on both sides. It is at this point that Homer picks up the story in his epic poem the Iliad. The Homeric Epics The Question of Authorship The Iliad and the Odyssey are traditionally attributed to Homer, a poet about whom we know virtually nothing beyond the speculation that he may have lived on an island off the coast of Asia Minor between 800 and 700 B.C. Legends depicting Homer as blind may have been extrapolated from his portrayal of the blind bard, Demodocus, in the Odyssey. But since Homer also describes a sighted bard in the same epic, we must infer the possibility of embellishment by Homer’s admirers, placing him in the tradition of the blind prophet of the myths, Tiresias, who, undistracted by surface appearances, sees moral truths, just as the poet must. Both poems exhibit what scholars agree are signs of oral composition: fixed epi- thets and adjectives (“wily Odysseus,” “swift-footed Achilles”), set speeches made by one character and repeated verbatim by another, and genealogies of characters, weap- ons, and even animals. Both poems also share qualities of style and, to a lesser extent, structure. Thus, some scholars believe that one poet composed both works. The poems’ perspectives, however—on the characteristics of the gods, the role of women, the value of the heroic life, and the nature of the universe itself—differ radically. Did a single poet change his mind about many important issues? We have clear evidence from more recent times of poets who have done just that. Or were these poems composed by one poet and later modified by different hands who wrote them down? Were they composed by different poets and possibly later recorded by the same edi- tor? We have, to date, no verifiable answers to these questions. Although the multiple- authorship theory is the most common one among modern scholars, for ease of ref- erence, this text will henceforth cite Homer as the author of both texts. The Literary Transformations: Myth into Epic Both poems make extensive use of inherited mythic materials. But neither is merely a retelling of traditional stories. Literary devices such as the use of dialogue and of an omniscient narrator (the all-knowing author who can reveal what his characters, hu- man or divine, are thinking and can comment on the tale directly) allow the poet to impose his own perspective on the myths. Further, the author has shaped the received material into a specific literary form,"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"322 The Myth ic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes the epic. Choosing to write in the epic genre (or literary type) itself constitutes an interpretation of the myths. The epic entails what were undoubtedly, by Homer’s time, already formal conventions: the proem (the opening passages establishing the author’s central concerns), the semidivinity of the hero, and the hero’s descent into the Underworld. The choice of the epic form—traditionally, for the Greeks, the highest of the genres—also establishes the author’s conviction of the seriousness and grandeur of his subject. A long narrative poem celebrating the achievements of a culture and the deeds of a hero who protects it, the epic is itself an expression of pride in one’s civilization. Epics transform their mythic sources in other ways as well. In contrast to the timeless world of myth, the epic is rooted in human time. In the Iliad, for example, the poet keeps reminding his audience of the passage of time: time taken out for the cremation of corpses; time remembered in the genealogies; time compared (as the aged Nestor does, recalling the days of his youth, when heroes were really spectacu- lar). In the Odyssey, time is even more prominent: ten years for the war, followed by ten years of wandering; the growth of Telemachus; the aging of Penelope and Odys- seus. Even his dog, Argos, a pup when Odysseus left, reminds us, as he wags his tail one last time in joy at Odysseus’s return before expiring, of the inexorable drive to- ward death that lends such urgency to human experience. Besides using (and, indeed, expanding) the possibilities of the epic form, Homer also selected and transformed the available mythic material to reflect his own thematic perspectives. Thus, while the traditional myth presents a narrative that is itself simple but open-ended, the literary work presents a more complicated but closed narrative with a defined beginning, middle, and end. Homer also uses epic similes (extended comparisons) to ground his works in the soil of real human experience, despite the presence of the gods and the quasi- supernatural adventures of the heroes. He thereby allows us to imagine the more remote actions in terms of the more familiar. Thus, although we have surely never seen a monster like Scylla reach down, pluck a man off a ship, and eat him, we have probably seen a man fishing from a rock who casts his line and plucks a fish from the water, a more common experience to which Homer, in a simile in the Odyssey, com- pares the more fantastic one. Similarly, although we are not half-divine and may not understand what it feels like to possess the heroes’ superhuman powers, we can surely understand how using a tool extends the power of the human hand; thus, Paris, in a simile, compares Hector’s prowess to a sharpened ax-edge that extends the powers of the hero. Other literary devices, some of which Homer probably invented (the cliff-hanger and the interrupted flashback), also help shape the material. Consider, for example, the startling juxtaposition in the great chase scene in the Iliad. Achilles chases Hector three times around the walls of Troy before he finally catches and kills his rival (see Color Plate 9). But in the midst of the scene, Homer interrupts the chase for an extended description of how, on that spot in the days before the war, women used to do the laundry. What better way to remind the audience of the values that, in their preoccupation with personal glory and impending death, both heroes have forgotten: what both sides in the war are ostensibly fighting for is the right to carry on their prosaic domestic lives, the right to keep their families and their daily rituals intact, the right to do the laundry in peace."},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"Heroes at War 323 The llidd Omitting all mention of the Promethean prophecy, of the decision of Paris and the divine quarrel that precedes the war, and of the failed attempt of Thetis to immortal- ize her son, Homer centers the Iliad squarely in the human world. Unlike the Odys- sey, which opens on Mount Olympus with the gods in council, the Iliad begins in the Greek encampment. The gods do not appear until the priest Chryses, offended at Agamemnon’s refusal to ransom his daughter, calls on Apollo to intervene. Nor does the poet choose to chronicle the war itself; neither the sacrifice of Iphigenia nor the death of Achilles nor the sacking of Troy is ever mentioned. Beginning instead with a single event in the ninth year of the long-stalemated war, Homer chooses to focus entirely on the quarrel between Achilles and Agamemnon and its consequences in order to explore some central questions that must be raised in a society in which kings are warriors and warriors are heroes. What does it mean to be a hero? How valid is the code of honor by which heroes live? Wliat are the hero’s potentials and limitations? How far can a hero go in pursuing his goals without either ofiFending the gods or alienating himself from the human community? How does a hero commit violent acts to defend his civilization without undermining the values he is fighting for? And, finally, how can a hero create a meaningful life for himself in the face of certain death? The Hero’s Nature The heroes we meet in the Iliad are, like Heracles, divided souls. Gifted with enor- mous energy and the drive to use it, they take an aggressive stance toward life, whether in the characteristic “shoot first, ask questions later” attitude or in the irre- sistible impulse always to “go forward,” to attack their problems or their enemies head-on. Hector can no more sit contentedly inside the walls of Troy and simply outwait the Greeks—however logical a strategy that might be—than Achilles can remain sulking in his tent or hiding safely at home. Each can fulfill his gifts, his inner nature, only by being what he is. As Paris is a born lover whose gifts are the blessing of Aphrodite, so Achilles and Hector are, by nature, warriors. But to fulfill their needs as godlike warriors, they must violate their social needs as human beings. The Hero s Two Fates Achilles is presented with not one but two fates: to die gloriously at Troy or to live anonymously at home. The choices confronting him, however, are at best ambiguous: for individuals such as Achilles and Hector, to choose inaction is to suffer the death of the soul that occurs when one’s identity is shattered; to choose action, on the other hand, is to choose to die, sooner or later, in battle. Doomed whether he goes or stays, such an individual is confronted by the same tragic paradox that beset Heracles; to escape the mortality that is the inevitable lot of hu- manity, the hero strives to immortalize his name by pursuing glory. But in order to choose death with honor, he must, of course, choose death. Propelled by the enor- mous heroic energy that consumes as it inspires them, both Hector and Achilles arrive at the same moment of recognition and make the same decision: “Let it come.” For the epic hero, as for the hero of the later tragedies, the readiness is all."},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"324 The Mythic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes FIGURE 11-2 The Ar- mour of Achilles. In this vase painting (c. 460 B.C.), Thetis embraces her son, who is still grieving for the death of Patroclus. Athene is present, on the left, to lend her support to the re- arming of the despondent hero. His new shield is held by two Nereids, one of whom, herself saddened by the spectacle of Achilles’ grief, covers her own face. (British Museum, London) The Hero’s Reputation The //zW describes a world in which the glory of a hero is not merely the consequence of divine gifts. Rather, his reputation must be publicly confirmed. Unique by virtue of his skills, the hero nevertheless must depend on the community to confer heroic status, signified through rank, rewards, prizes, songs, and stories. It is all too easy, then, to confuse the outward signs of heroism with the intrinsic merit and the amaz- ing deeds of the true hero. Both Agamemnon and Achilles confuse the rank of general and the status of hero with the outward signs of respect from their troops or peers. Forgetting that a general needs his troops, Agamemnon neglects his responsibilities to his men, thinks of his own need for “prizes” sufficient for his rank, and suffers by losing men and battles. Forgetting that even heroes need the bonds of human society, Achilles, humiliated by having his “prize” publicly removed, withdraws from the field and suffers by losing his beloved friend Patroclus [pa-TROFi-kluhs] (Figure 11-2). Achilles and Hector Enraged by grief, Achilles forgets his human limitations and imagines that he can stand up to a raging river god, commit atrocities against the dead, and ignore the need to eat. Only when he is at last reconciled with Priam, whose son. Hector, Achilles has killed and whose corpse he refuses to release (Figure 11-3), does he belatedly recognize that the demands of the belly signify communion with the gods (as men pray and sacrifice some of each meal), the limits of the merely human body, and the bonds that unite human beings into a community (as men feast together). Only then does Achilles emerge from the shell of egocentricity and begin to say we instead of /. Hector exhibits similar confusion. Determined to protect his family and honor, he confuses honor with blind loyalty and fights in what he knows is a bad cause. He, too, knows that the inevitable consequence will be the destruction of the very city for which he sacrifices himself"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"Heroes at War 325 FIGURE 11-3 Priam Pleading with Achilles for the Body of Hector. In this vase painting, the bearded Priam, leaning on his staff, appeals to Achilles, shown here reclining under his famous helmet and shield, for the return of his son Hector s corpse, here stretched under Achilles’ chair. Rejecting the gifts offered by Priam’s followers, Achilles turns his face from the old man. (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna) Diomedes Among these exalted but tragic heroes, one figure emerges as a more moderate alternative— D i omedes [dye-oh-MEE-deez] “of the loud war cry.” For- midable in battle, willing and able to take on and defeat even the gods themselves, he nevertheless knows when to stop. He is able to accept limits, whether required by the rules of courtesy (he will not, for example, fight Glaucus, the Trojan descendant of a guest-friend of Diomedes’ own grandfather) or by direct orders from the gods (urged on by Athene, Diomedes wounds both Aphrodite and Ares, but when Apollo tells him not to attack any more gods, he obeys). Although he possesses the courage and the skills of the hero, he is not driven to meet experience head-on in defiance of the consequences. He is, furthermore, as persuasive in the assembly as he is effective on the battlefield. No one will ever compose songs about Diomedes. Nevertheless, he possesses the kind of balance that the Greeks later came to admire. (Much later, by the fifth century B.C., the qualities exhibited by Diomedes—the equal development of mind and body, the rational way of self-knowledge and self-control—would be- come the ideals of classical Greek culture.) Odysseus The most gifted speaker among the Greeks, Odysseus is able to use his characteristic diplomacy and common sense to his advantage—for example, persuad- ing the Greeks not to retreat to the ships, stepping into the gap when Agamemnon’s leadership momentarily falters, and preserving discipline and morale. But although we get to see him in action as a great soldier (rescuing the corpse of Patroclus, for example, along with his usual companion, Ajax), his most noteworthy activities are his intelligence operations, such as sneaking into Troy in disguise or wreaking havoc"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"326 The Mythic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes Creek and Anglicized Spellin: gs of Characters Names in the llhd Because different translators adopt differing English transliterations of Greek names, the names of characters in Greek literature are spelled in a variety of ways. Whereas this text uses an Anglicized spelling, the translation of the Iliad included here adopts a spelling approximating the pronunciation of the original Greek. The following list provides a sampling of both versions of the names. (For a similar list of variant spellings of gods’ names, see Chapter 5.) Aias (Ajax) Hektor (Hector) Aineias (Aeneas) Kalkhas (Calchas) Akhaians (Achaeans) Khryseis (Chryseis) Akhilleus (Achilles) Klytaimnestra (Clytemnestra) Glaukos (Glaucus) Menelaos (Menelaus) Hekabe (Hecuba) Patroklos (Patroclus) at night in the Trojan encampment. His willingness to use disguises and deceptions, of course, eventually allows the Greeks to win (via the strategem of the Trojan Horse, a clever ruse that Homer does not include in the Iliad). Indeed, the Greeks valued his services, but heroes do not sneak about in disguise or under cover of darkness. Behaving as if the aim is to win the war and get home instead of to display one’s heroic prowess in a game, Odysseus is a somewhat ambiguous hero (see Ghapter 12). The Gods If the human world is confused, the realm of the Olympians is equally disordered. Divided among themselves, the gods nag, quarrel, lie, deceive, and, of course, take sides—Hera, Poseidon, and Athene favor the Greeks, while Apollo, Artemis, and Aphrodite favor the Trojans. Ares, the two-faced god of war, simply enjoys the sport and fights on both sides. Zeus himself, although temporarily yielding to Thetis’s re- quest to support Achilles in his quarrel with Agamemnon (see Color Plate 5), is relatively neutral, having worshipers and favorite heroes on both sides and even a son, Sarpedon, among the Trojans. He would prefer a peaceful compromise or at least an agreement by the other gods not to intervene. But he is unable to arrange the former or to prevent the latter. The Gods’ Intervention in Human Affairs The gods intervene in human affairs in a variety of ways. They affect the action indirectly by encouraging the men to commit acts of courage, by sending dreams that inspire fear or affect morale, and by bringing up clouds of darkness to cover retreats or to interrupt battles. More directly, they also intervene by assuming human disguises and entering the battlefield, where they block the path of arrows or actually fight, both as aggressors (as when Apollo knocks the wind out of Patroclus, setting him up to be killed) and as targets (as when both Ares and Aphrodite are wounded by Diomedes). Unlike the human combat-"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"Heroes at War 327 FIGURE 11-4 Achilles Dragging the Body of Hector past the Tomb of Patroclus. In this vase painting (early fifth century B.C.), Achilles is shown dragging Hector’s corpse, which he has lashed to his chariot, past Patroclus’s tomb to avenge the death of his departed friend. In attempting to mutilate the body, Achilles violates the gods’ requirement that the dead be re- spected and given proper burial. (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) ants, however, the gods bleed ichor [IH-kohr] instead of blood and cannot really be hurt—being immortal, they need only to retreat to Olympus, where a balm applied by Hephaestus instantly cures all wounds. The gods of the Iliad may appear superfi- cially human in their behavior, but the crucial distinction remains: gods simply do not die. For the gods, then, the war is like a game in which they cheer on their favorite teams and players and occasionally spill over onto the playing field. Ultimately, the fate of individual humans can be of little real consequence to them. The Powers and Limitations of the Gods The gods of the Iliad are not omnipo- tent: they preside over but do not absolutely control the universe. Zeus, for example, “father of gods and men,” is unable to force the Olympians to comply with his wishes. And although he may rattle their wine cups with his thunderbolts or threaten to dangle recalcitrant deities from a chain off Mount Olympus, he is, in fact, appar- ently unwilling or unable to do so—nor could he without abrogating his role as a god who (unlike his father and grandfather) rules by persuasion, not violence. Nor can the gods control human behavior: despite his own preference for a ne- gotiated solution, Zeus cannot force the warring parties to make peace or compel Achilles to return to Priam Hector’s body, which he drags for eleven days past the tomb of Patroclus to avenge his friend’s death at Hector’s hands (Figure 11-4). The gods do, however, reinforce the values of courtesy and the guest-host relationship applicable to humans and gods alike. Thus, Zeus, who owes a debt of gratitude to Thetis, obliges her by assenting to her request that he help Achilles. And Apollo, who was a guest-friend at the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, cannot now violate that bond by stealing Hector’s corpse from their son Achilles. On similar grounds, it is clear to all, even to the Trojans themselves, that the Trojans must eventually lose the war for having violated the sanctity of the bonds between guest and host, as well as the sacred institution of marriage. At the moment when Paris, a guest in Menelaus’s home, seduced and ran off with his wife and treasure, he doomed the city of Troy."},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"328 The Myth ic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes For the humans, the acknowledgment of obligations to the gods includes piety, especially the expression of their gratitude to the gods. Apollo, for instance, brings down the plague in the Greek camp in answer to the prayers of the pious Trojan priest Chryses. This divine-human connection is also made through rituals, especially various forms of sacrifice and communion, from pouring off some wine to share with the gods at each meal to sacrificing an entire animal; such rituals are symbolic expres- sions of the human dependence on the gods for their physical and spiritual well- being. But although the gods react firmly to punish violations of these universal val- ues, they do not necessarily reward piety in corresponding fashion: Fiector, admired by the gods, especially Apollo, as a pious man, is nevertheless abandoned to his fate when he confronts Achilles. Not even Apollo can enable Fiector to defeat a better fighter than himself. The gods may regret the death of Hector, but they do not pre- vent it. Unlike the motally neat and essentially comic world of the Odyssey, where the good are eventually rewarded and the wicked struck by lightning bolts, and thus happy endings are assured, the //zWdepicts a more unpredictable and thus potentially tragic world. Human Destiny It is not the gods, furthermore, who dictate human destiny. Rather, humans deter- mine their own fate, the inevitable consequences of their own freely chosen acts. The essential freedom of individuals is signified in the Iliad by three recurring motifs: the dual destinies, the image of the scales, and the two urns. The dual destinies of humans are best symbolized by the alternative fates of Achil- les, who is destined to live a long but unremarkable life if he chooses to stay at home or a short but glorious life if he chooses to fight at Troy. Thus, his fate is not pre- determined but conditional: when he makes his choice, the consequences follow. And that choice, to be meaningful, must transcend external coercion of any kind, whether divine or human, and derive instead from a sense of his own integrity. His truly heroic nature is fulfilled not merely by the use of his special gifts but, more importantly, by his acceptance of moral responsibility for his own fate. On the gods’ part, the sense of alternative destinies—of a universe of freedom and possibilities—is reflected in the image of the scales in which Zeus weighs the fate of humans. Each time, Zeus suspends the scales by the midpoint and reads what they reveal. Although on one level the image concretizes the act of divine judgment, it also suggests that Zeus does not determine which pan rises up or which sinks down any more than holding up a thermometer determines the temperature of the air. The implications of a world in which humans are free to choose among complex possibilities are perhaps most concretely stated by Achilles himself, when he describes the two urns from which Zeus doles out gifts: like Pandora’s jar, the urns contain both blessings and curses, pleasures and pains, good news and bad news. Unfortunate individuals, Achilles explains, experience nothing but suffering; fortunate individuals experience great joy along with the suffering. He cites his father, Peleus, as an ex- ample: heroic, wealthy, married to a goddess, and father to a son he can be proud of, Peleus is blessed beyond the hopes of most men. But he will also have to confront his son’s early death and to grow old and die alone. Only the gods live happily forever; mixed blessings are the best a human being can hope for."},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"Heroes at War 329 The Heroic Code Homer’s portrayal of the code by which the heroes live is equally ambivalent. On the positive side, we are compelled to admire the hero’s strength, courage, and skill; his intensity and drive; and his willingness to risk all. On the negative side, we watch in dismay as his excessive strength and zeal lead to uncontrolled violence and as his need to fight undermines his good sense and moral values. On the positive side, we admire the hero’s dedication; his loyalty to his friends, family, and society; and his commit- ment to keep promises. Achilles fights in a cause not his own, for a promise made, and the depth of his friendship for Patroclus is a model of devotion. On the negative side, we witness emotional and behavioral excesses as heroic commitments turn into misdirected loyalty, such as Priam’s in defending his son, right or wrong, or Hector’s in fighting for what he admits is a bad cause, or Axhilles’ in stubbornly persisting in his attempts to mutilate Hector’s corpse. The heroic code calls for high ideals—respect among equals, courtesy, and adher- ence to the rules, on the field and off. But it also encourages a corollary contempt for inferiors. Odysseus, for example, trying to keep the demoralized troops from depart- ing, speaks respectfully to his fellow officers but insults the common soldiers. The Heroic Combat Similarly, we share the hero’s pride as he glories in victory, and we are dismayed as that pride gives way to vain egotism, to gloating over the fallen. And we are always reminded that victory for one hero necessitates death for another. The ideal model of heroic combat is the single combat between two heroes who respect each other’s reputation, skill, and family; who fight face-to-face accord- ing to the rules of warfare; whose encounter, like a game, is monitored by a referee; who keep the armor but respect the corpse if they win; and who part as friends if they fight to a draw. The point of such a combat (for example, the match between Hector and Ajax) is not to defeat an enemy but to enhance one’s heroic reputation. To the gods, war is a game. When war is presented as a challenge match between two heroic contenders, human beings, too, can easily idealize warfare as a glorious game, an opportunity for the heroes to exhibit their godlike skills. But, as many readers have noted, it is a zero- sum game in which there are ultimately no winners. And the illusion of the game is all too easily shattered, giving way to savagery, as when Achilles captures and beheads twelve anonymous Trojans in vengeance for Patroclus’s death. Worse, in the heat of battle, the game, with its dream of glory, turns into a night- mare, and we are forced to watch in extreme close-up as brains spatter or guts spill out onto the ground. The climactic encounter between Achilles and Hector takes place on a quasi-surreal plane where there are no rules, no umpires, and no escape. The gods may, at their discretion, turn their attention from the war to their dinner, as Hephaestus suggests. Hector, chased by the relentless Achilles around and around the walls of Troy, is trapped in a nightmare from which he will never awaken. The Role of Women If the heroes are trapped in a nightmare, it is at least one of their own choosing. Modern readers will recognize that the real victims in the masculine world of the"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"330 The Mythic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes epics are the women. Legally the property of their husbands or fathers, women are used freely as loot—the booty of war—or given as prizes in athletic games. (In fact, their value was equated to that of draft animals; Achilles, for example, offers as a prize one woman good at crafts, valued at four oxen.) Several centuries later, the playwright Euripides will follow up the stories of the women in such plays as Trojan Women and Hecuba; but no one in the Homeric epics asks how a Chiyseis or a Briseis feels about being captured and forced to service the sexual needs of Agamemnon or Achilles. But even those women who are not literally slaves are also trapped, whether they remain within the body of the family or free themselves from its confines. Helen, for instance, the cause of it all, leaves her husband and family to follow her lover, only to find herself surrounded by hostile Trojans, her only refuge a lover who is reluctant to fight for her and for whom she has come to feel contempt. Nor do we find any instances of Menelaus’s expressing any love for Helen. His highly ornamental prop- erty has been taken, his pride offended; it is not Helen herself that Menelaus wants, for all her beauty. And Agamemnon openly expresses contempt for his own wife, Clytemnestra. With the singular exception of Odysseus, the Greek heroes, for all that they are fighting to restore family love, express little love for their own wives. The family bonds they feel are exclusively patriarchal, the ties between fathers and sons. In contrast to Helen, both Hectors mother, Hecuba [HEK-oo-ba], and his wife, Andromache [an-DROM-a-kee], remain entirely devoted to their families. Indeed, the household of Hector, Andromache, and the child, Astyanax, is presented as a model family—husband and wife utterly devoted to each other and openly affection- ate with the child, their love so embracing that it even encompasses the horses, whom they name and pamper as family pets (see Color Plate 8). It is ironic that we see the Greeks, ostensibly the pro-family side in this war, living in a military camp, having abandoned their own families to fight for the reunion of Menelaus’s family, while the Trojans, responsible for the breakup of Menelaus’s family, are portrayed as ideal mod- els of family love. But, despite the mutual love of Hector and Andromache, she is nevertheless trapped in a society in which her needs and perceptions are not taken as seriously as those of the warriors. The traditional female role in the heroic myths is, of course, that of the temptress who tries to distract the hero from his quest, enticing him to indulge himself in the rewards and comforts of everyday life—food, sex, children, wealth. The Babylonian goddess of love and war, Ishtar, tempts Gilgamesh by attempting to seduce him, offering herself (as Calypso will later do to Odysseus) as his bride. He spurns her offer, pointing out that she has turned her previous lovers into animals (as Circe will do to Odysseus’s crew—see Chapter 12). For the hero, to yield to such temptations is to cut himself off from expressing those heroic qualities that lift him out of the mundane world and allow him to fulfill his godlike potential. In the Iliad, it is Aph- rodite, the goddess of love, who plays that role (along with her human counterpart, Helen), although her function as a war goddess, clear in the “judgment of Paris” myth, is attenuated in the epic, where golden apples play no part and where she is portrayed as an incompetent warrior. Nevertheless, her spirit prevails in Paris, who is more at home in the bedroom than on the battlefield; and even Achilles himself withdraws from battle in a quarrel over a woman. Similarly, the Sumerian/Babylonian wine goddess Siduri tempts Gilgamesh with prosaic creature comforts, attempting to persuade him to abort his journey to the Underworld. The Iliad's, counterpart to Siduri is Andromache herself, who also"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"Heroes at War 331 tempts Hector with the comforts of domestic life. Andromache thus has a dual role in the epic: from the conventional heroic perspective, as temptress, she attempts to dissuade Hector from going into battle, an offer he, of course, dismisses, sending her back to her “woman’s” pursuits, child care and weaving; from another perspective, as a manifestation of the wise goddess, she counsels commitment to the family and to achieving continuity through one’s children. Not compelled by nature or training into fitting the heroic mold, Andromache is free to see the truth that no one else in the epic, apart from the narrator, will acknowl- edge; Hector’s compulsion to fight is strategically unnecessary and, worse, destructive to the very family that Hector is fighting to save. She tells him as much—the price of his glory is her enslavement: she and the child will be taken as slaves by the Greeks. Stay inside the walls, she advises, or at least don’t go beyond the nearby fig tree, which could thus literally be a “Tree of Life,” reminding us of the archetypal symbol of the feminine principle. Compelled both by their nature and by social conditioning. Hector and Achilles cannot acknowledge the feminine aspect of their own natures, their anima. Hector acknowledges the validity of Andromache’s argument but, being a hero, cannot act on it: he must go forward. Achilles, too, rejects the protective urging of his mother and ends up bringing about the death of his best friend, Patroclus, who, assuming Achilles’ identity along with his armor, becomes an alter ego whose death prefigures Achilles’ own. This exclusively masculine heroic code is destructive to families, de- structive to peace, and destructive to civilization itself, which requires the stability of affection and commitment and the peace in which to nurture the relationships of domestic life. But the social code of the Bronze Age, as depicted in the Iliad, rein- forced traditional heroic attitudes. To stay at home was associated with the feminine principle: grown men fought; women, children, and impotent old men stayed at home. Paris, who prefers making love to making war, is accused by Hector of skulk- ing at home “like a woman.” Holding up the heroic code for us to view from a variety of often conflicting perspectives, the Iliad asks questions but does not offer answers, in keeping with the artist’s role, as described by the bard Demodocus, to see the truth, in all its complexity, and to tell it. By showing us Andromache’s perspective and reminding us of it in the brief glimpse on domestic life when he pauses to reflect on doing the laundry in the midst of the chase scene, Homer comments ironically on the limits of the heroic model. The hero so narrowly defined cannot achieve wholeness. Such partial consciousness is self-destructive, not just to the body but to the person- ality as well. And it is the women who are given the last word, as they lament the death of Hector. But for all these brief glimpses of the role of women, Homer’s focus in the Iliad remains largely, if somewhat ambivalently, on the hero. Achilles is, after all, the most revered of all the Greek heroes, and the Iliad celebrates his glory even as it questions the value of the war by which he achieved it. The feminine principle will have to lie in waiting until, in the Odyssey, a new kind of hero emerges to effect the reconciliation of opposites, the integration of the divided self Achilles’ phallic instrument of de- struction, his Pelian ash, was presumably once a tree, the symbol of the feminine principle. In the Odyssey, Odysseus is said to have carved the olive tree (symbol of Athene) not into a spear but into a marriage bed, leaving it still rooted in the earth, the primordial mother—the phallus and the Tree of Life rejoined."},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"332 The Myth ic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes The Conclusion of the Iliad The epic ends with the funeral of Hector—a celebration of the life of a heroic indi- vidual, a ritual that affirms, even in the face of death, the value of life. Although the saga of Troy is carried on in the myths through the eventual death of Achilles and the defeat of the Trojans, in the epic, the renewed commitment of Achilles and the death of Hector make the fate of both Achilles and Troy inevitable. Rather than describing them, however, Homer chooses for his climactic point the moment of reconcilia- tion— of the hero and his society, of honor and integrity, of life and death. The Rite of Passage In many myths, the hero’s rite of passage is literal—he goes on a journey, often to the Underworld, and returns with new knowledge, as did Gilgamesh, Heracles, Odysseus, and Aeneas. Perhaps more like the heroes of the later tragedies, Achilles’ journey has been to the hell within. His isolation is psychological rather than physical: he does not have to travel to the Underworld because it comes to him, literally, in the form of Patroclus’s shade (his ghost or spirit) and the corpses he heaps up — in perverse tribute to his friend—in his camp, which quickly takes on an atmosphere of the Underworld. It also comes to him psychologically as he under- goes the experiences of separation and alienation, descends into the depths of grief and rage, and does battle with the gods themselves. Returning with new insight into the ambiguous nature of human experience and the limits of mortality, he is at last reconciled with the community of his fellow humans. The ego-driven hero with the hair-trigger temper of the opening chapters, obsessed with honor defined externally as public reputation, has yielded, albeit after great loss, to a more mature, more com- passionate, more self-controlled Achilles who will be a hero because his own integrity, not merely his public image, requires it. Later playwrights and philosophers, from Aeschylus to Socrates, would argue that human beings “must suffer to be wise.” If that is the case, Achilles has earned—and paid for—his wisdom. The Trojan Cycle Completed Although the Iliad ends with the funeral of Hector, the myths continue the story to the end of the war and beyond. One of the many related stories tells of Penthesilea, the Amazon queen who disguises herself in a man’s armor and fights with incredible skill until she is killed by Achilles himself (see Chapter 10). The Death of Achilles Achilles himself is eventually killed at the gates of Troy by an arrow in the heel, shot, according to some versions, by Paris, who was hiding behind the city walls. Other versions credit Apollo with the fatal shot or describe Apollo as guiding Paris’s hand. Achilles’ corpse and armor are rescued by Odysseus and Ajax; Achilles’ ashes are buried in a golden urn together with the ashes of Patroclus, and a huge mound is erected as a memorial, but the rescuers can’t agree on which of them is to receive the armor. They present their cases in speeches before the assembly, and Odysseus, always a masterful speaker, is awarded the honor. Ajax, furious at being thus humiliated, goes mad.

When he returns to his senses and realizes what he has done, he commits suicide. Still the war goes on. The Greeks are told of prophecies that several tasks must be accomplished before they can defeat Troy. For example, they must bring Neoptole- mus, Achilles’ son, to join the battle: he does so and becomes a hero in his own right. They must bring the Palladium, a statue of Athene, from the city of Troy; Odysseus, once again operating as the Greeks’ major intelligence agent, sneaks into Troy dis- guised as a beggar to accomplish the theft. Furthermore, the Greeks must bring the bow of Heracles from the island of Lemnos, where they had abandoned Philoctetes (the owner of the bow) because of a snakebite he’d suffered, which caused an agoniz- ing wound that smelled so foul the troops could not bear to be near him. The Trojan Horse When all the assigned tasks are accomplished but the walls of Troy are still not breached, it is Odysseus who devises the trick that ends the war. He designs a hollow wooden horse in which he hides with a group of Greek officers. The prophetess Cassandra tries to warn the Trojans, but no one understands her warnings. A priest, Laocoon [lay-AHK-oh-ahn], also tries to warn them, but he is prevented from doing so by Poseidon, who sends a sea serpent to strangle him and his sons. A soldier named Sinon is assigned to deliver the horse to the Trojans as a peace offering from the Greek armies, which pretend to be departing. Sinon claims to have been abandoned as a deserter and to be seeking asylum. The Trojans open the gates and bring the hollow horse inside the city, where they begin a great victory celebra- tion. When the Trojans are at last asleep, Odysseus and his men emerge from the horse and open the gates for the Greek forces, which have silently assembled just outside. Once inside the city, they defeat the Trojans. The men (all but Aeneas and his household) are killed, the women and children taken prisoner, and the city looted and burned. After ten years of battling for honor and glory, after all those deaths, the city of Troy falls to a clever trick. The games, the heroic battles, the sacrifices, have all proved futile: intelligence, not prowess, is the weapon that brings victory. The Return of the Achaeans The battle won, the Greeks divide up the loot and sail for home. But their ten-year struggle has already set in motion consequences far beyond the military victory. The myths that spin off from the war detailing the returns of Agamemnon (see Ghapter 15) and Odysseus (see Ghapter 12) relate the problems of a postwar world struggling to return to normalcy or to create a new kind of order."},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"ILIAD* Homer BOOK 1 Anger be now your song, immortal one, Akhilleus’ anger, doomed and ruinous, that caused the Akhaians loss on bitter loss and crowded brave souls into the undergloom, leaving so many dead men—carrion for dogs and birds; and the will of Zeus was done. Begin it when the two men first contending broke with one another— the Lord Marshal Agamemnon, Atreus’ son, and Prince Akhilleus. Among the gods, who brought this quarrel on? The son of Zeus by Leto. Agamemnon angered him, so he made a burning wind of plague rise in the army: rank and file sickened and died for the ill their chief had done in despising a man of prayer. This priest, Khryses, had come down to the ships with gifts, no end of ransom for his daughter; on a golden staff he carried the god’s white bands and sued for grace from the men of all Akhaia, the two Atreidai most of all: “O captains Menelaos and Agamemnon, and you other Akhaians under arms! The gods who hold Olympos, may they grant you plunder of Priam’s town and a fair wind home, but let me have my daughter back for ransom as you revere Apollo, son of Zeus!” Then all the soldiers murmured their assent: “Behave well to the priest. And take the ransom!” But Agamemnon would not. It went against his desire, and brutally he ordered the man away: “Let me not find you here by the long ships loitering this time or returning later, old man; if I do, the staff and ribbons of the god will fail you. 1 10 20 30 * Translation by Robert Fitzgerald. 334"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"ILIAD 335 Give up the girl?

Apart from the ships he halted and let fly, and the bowstring slammed as the silver bow sprang, rolling in thunder away. Pack animals were his target first, and dogs, but soldiers, too, soon felt transfixing pain from his hard shots, and pyres burned night and day. Nine days the arrows of the god came down broadside upon the army. On the tenth, Akhilleus called all ranks to assembly. Hera, whose arms are white as ivory, moved him to it, as she took pity on Danaans dying. All being mustered, all in place and quiet, Akhilleus, fast in battle as a lion, rose and said: “Agamemnon, now, I take it, the siege is broken, we are going to sail, and even so may not leave death behind: if war spares anyone, disease will take him . . .

Akhilleus made his way to his squadron and his quarters, Patroklos by his side, with his companions. Agamemnon proceeded to launch a ship, 360 assigned her twenty oarsmen, loaded beasts for sacrifice to the god, then set aboard Khryseis in her loveliness. The versatile Odysseus took the deck, and, all oars manned, they pulled out on the drenching ways of sea.

Not far from his black ship and hut they found the prince in the open, seated. And seeing these two come was cheerless to Akhilleus. Shamefast, pale with fear of him, they stood without a word; but he knew what they felt and called out: “Peace to you, criers and couriers of Zeus and men! Come forward. Not one thing have I against you: 390 Agamemnon is the man who sent you for Briseis. Here then, my lord Patroklos, bring out the girl and give her to these men.

Back along the ships they took their way, and the girl went, loath to go. Leaving his friends in haste, Akhilleus wept, and sat apart by the grey wave, scanning the endless sea. Often he spread his hands in prayer to his mother: “As my life came from you, though it is brief, honor at least from Zeus who storms in heaven I call my due.

All of our soldiers murmured in assent: ‘Behave well to the priest. And take the ransom!’ But Agamemnon would not. It went against his desire, and brutally he ordered the man away.

Piercing the bright shield, the whetted spearhead cut its way into his figured cuirass, ripping his shirt along his flank; but he had twisted and escaped the night of death. Now both men disengaged their spears and fell on one another like man-eating lions or wild boars—no tame household creatures. Hektor’s lancehead scored the tower shield—but failed to pierce it, as the point was bent aside. Then Alas, plunging forward, rammed his spear into the round shield, and the point went through to nick his furious adversary, making a cut that welled dark blood below his ear.

Hera’s angry rejection of Zeus’s illegitimate child, born to a human mother, Alcmene, thwarts her husband’s attempt to render Heracles immortal by absorbing divine nourishment from his wife and condemns the hero to a life of hardship and pain (see Chapter 10).

Akhilleus drew his sword and thrust between his neck and collarbone, so the two-edged blade went in up to the hilt. Now face down on the ground he lay stretched out, as dark blood flowed from him, soaking the earth. Akhilleus picked him up by one foot, wheeled, and slung him in the river to be swept off downstream. Then he exulted: “Nose down there with fishes. In cold blood they’ll kiss your wound and nip your blood away. Your mother cannot put you on your bed to mourn you, but Skamander whirling down will bear you to the sea’s broad lap, where any fish that jumps, breaking a wave, may dart under the dark wind-shivered water to nibble white fat of Lykaon.

He cast about for ways to halt prodigious Akhilleus’ feats of war and keep death from the Trojans. Meanwhile the son of Peleus took his spear and bounded straight for Asteropaios, burning to kill this son of Pelegon, whom the broad river Axios had fathered on Periboia, eldest of the daughters of Akessamenos. Whirling, deep-running river that he was, Axios loved her. And now Akhilleus made for Asteropaios, who came up from the stream-bed to confront him, holding two spears. And Xanthos, in his anger over all the young men dead, cut down by Akhilleus pitilessly in the stream, gave heart to this contender.

My line began, if you must know, with Axios, mover of beautiful water over land, who fathered the great spearman, PHegon, and Pelegon is said to have fathered me. But now again to battle. Lord Akhilleus.” That was his prideful answer. Then Akhilleus lifted his Pelian ash. His enemy, being ambidextrous, cast both spears at once and failed. With one he hit Akhilleus’ shield but could not pierce it, for the gold plate held, the god’s gift; with his other spear he grazed the hero’s right forearm. Dark blood ran out, but, craving manflesh still, the spear passed on and fixed itself in earth. In turn, Akhilleus, putting his heart into the cast to bring down Asteropaios, rifled his ashwood spear. He missed him, hitting the high bank of the river, where the long shaft punched in to half its length. The son of Peleus, drawing sword from hip, lunged forward on his enemy, who could not with his big fist work the spear loose: three times he tried to wrench it from the arching bank, three times relaxed his grip, then put his weight into a fourth attempt to break the shaft, and bent it; but Akhilleus closed and killed him with a sword stroke. Near the navel he slashed his belly; all his bowels dropped out uncoiling to the ground. He gasped, and darkness veiled his eyes. Upon his chest Akhilleus mounted, and then bent to strip his armor, gloating: 60 70 80 “This way you’ll rest.

Then eels and fish attended to the body, picking and nibbling kidney fat away. 110 As for Akhilleus, he ran onward, chasing spearmen of Paionia in their rout along the eddying river: these had seen their hero vanquished by the hand and blade and power of Akhilleus. Now he slew Thersilokhos, Mydon, and Astypylos, Mnesos, Thrasios, Ainios, Ophelestes, and would have killed far more, had not the river, cold with rage, in likeness of a man, assumed a voice and spoken from a whirlpool: 120 “O Akhilleus, you are first in power of all men, first in waywardness as well, as gods forever take your side.

You could defend them until sunset comes, till evening darkens grainland.” As he spoke, the great spearman Akhilleus in a flash leapt into midstream from the arching bank. But he, the river, surged upon the man with all his currents in a roaring flood, and swept up many of the dead, who jostled in him, killed by Akhilleus. He ejected 150 these to landward, bellowing like a bull, but living men he kept in his blue streams to hide them in deep places, in backwaters. Then round Akhilleus with an ominous roar a wave mounted. It fell against his shield and staggered him, so that he lost his footing. Throwing his arms around a leafy elm he clung to it; it gave way, roots and all, and tore the bank away, and dipped its branches in the clear currents, damming up the river 160 when all had fallen in. The man broke free of swirling water, turned into the plain and ran like wind, in fear. But the great god would not be shaken off: with his dark crest he reared behind to put the Prince Akhilleus out of action and protect the Trojans.

Lifting his eyes to heaven, Akhilleus cried: “Father Zeus, to think that in my travail not one god would save me from the river— only that! Then I could take the worst! None of the gods of heaven is so to blame as my own mother, who beguiled me, lying, saying my end would come beneath Troy’s wall from flashing arrows of Apollo.

No, I was fated to ignoble death, whelmed in a river, like a swineherd’s boy caught by a winter torrent as he crosses.” Now as he spoke, Poseidon and Athena, taking human form, moved near and stood, and took his hands to tell him what would calm him.

Hektor stood firm, as huge Akhilleus neared. The way a serpent, fed on poisonous herbs, coiled at his lair upon a mountainside, with all his length of hate awaits a man and eyes him evilly: so Hektor, grim and narrow-eyed, refused to yield.

Then I might add, apart from these, a portion of all the secret wealth the city owns. Yes, later I might take our counselors’ oath to hide no stores, but share and share alike to halve all wealth our lovely city holds, all that is here within the walls.

Now close at hand Akhilleus like the implacable god of war came on with blowing crest, hefting the dreaded beam of Pelian ash on his right shoulder.

Just as when chariot-teams around a course go wheeling swiftly, for the prize is great, a tripod or a woman, in the games held for a dead man, so three times these two at full speed made their course round Priam’s town, as all the gods looked on. And now the father of gods and men turned to the rest and said: “How sad that this beloved man is hunted around the wall before my eyes!

Every time he tried to sprint hard for the Dardan gates under the towers, hoping men would help him, 140 sending missiles down, Akhilleus loomed to cut him off and turn him toward the plain, as he himself ran always near the city. As in a dream a man chasing another cannot catch him, nor can he in flight escape from his pursuer, so Akhilleus could not by swiftness overtake him, nor could Hektor pull away. How could he run so long from death, had not Apollo for the last time, the very last, come near 150 to give him stamina and speed? Akhilleus shook his head at the rest of the Akhaians, allowing none to shoot or cast at Hektor— none to forestall him, and to win the honor. But when, for the fourth time, they reached the springs, the Father poised his golden scales. He placed two shapes of death, death prone and cold, upon them, one of Akhilleus, one of the horseman, Hektor, and held the midpoint, pulling upward.

Furious that he had lost it, made his throw for nothing, Hektor stood bemused. He had no other. Then he gave a great shout to Delphobos to ask for a long spear. But there was no one near him, not a soul. Now in his heart the Trojan realized the truth and said: “This is the end. The gods are calling deathward. 260 I had thought a good soldier, Delphobos, was with me. He is inside the walls. Athena tricked me. Death is near, and black, not at a distance, not to be evaded.

Still, I would not die without delivering a stroke, 270 or die ingloriously, but in some action memorable to men in days to come.” With this he drew the whetted blade that hung upon his left flank, ponderous and long, collecting all his might the way an eagle narrows himself to dive through shady cloud and strike a lamb or cowering hare: so Hektor lanced ahead and swung his whetted blade.

And Prince Akhilleus now exulted: “Hektor, had you thought 300 that you could kill Patroklos and be safe? Nothing to dread from me; I was not there. All childishness. Though distant then, Patroklos’ comrade in arms was greater far than he— and it is I who had been left behind that day beside the deepsea ships who now have made your knees give way.

Accept the bronze and gold my father will provide as gifts, my father and her ladyship my mother.

By day he rested in his own hut, abandoning Hektor’s body to lie full-length in dust—though Lord Apollo, pitying the man, even in death, kept his flesh free of disfigurement.

Shining gifts at the gods’ hands he had from birth: felicity, wealth overflowing, rule of the Myrmidons, a bride immortal at his mortal side. 230 But then Zeus gave afflictions too—no family of powerful sons grew up for him at home, but one child, of all seasons and of none.

They unharnessed mules and horses, led the old king’s crier to a low bench and sat him down. Then from the polished wagon they took the piled-up price of Hektor’s body. One khiton and two capes they left aside as dress and shrouding for the homeward journey. Then, calling to the women slaves, Akhilleus 280 ordered the body bathed and rubbed with oil— but lifted, too, and placed apart, where Priam could not see his son—for seeing Hektor he might in his great pain give way to rage, and fury then might rise up in Akhilleus to slay the old king, flouting Zeus’s word.

At the first sight of Dawn you shall take charge of him yourself and see him. Now let us think of supper. We are told that even Niobe in her extremity took thought for bread—though all her brood had perished, her six young girls and six tall sons.

And Akhilleus 340 in his turn gazed in wonder upon Priam, royal in visage as in speech. Both men in contemplation found rest for their eyes, till the old hero, Priam, broke the silence: “Make a bed ready for me, son of Thetis, and let us know the luxury of sleep. From that hour when my son died at your hands till now, my eyelids have not closed in slumber over my eyes, but groaning where I sat I tasted pain and grief a thousandfold, 350 or lay down rolling in my courtyard mire. Here for the first time I have swallowed bread and made myself drink wine. Before, I could not.” Akhilleus ordered men and servingwomen to make a bed outside, in the covered forecourt, with purple rugs piled up and sheets outspread and coverings of all fleece laid on top. The girls went out with torches in their hands and soon deftly made up a double bed. Then Akhilleus, defiant of Agamemnon, 360 told his guest: “Dear venerable sir, you’ll sleep outside tonight, in case an Akhaian officer turns up, one of those men who are forever taking counsel with me— as well they may. If one should see you here as the dark night runs on, he would report it to the Lord Marshal Agamemnon. Then return of the body would only be delayed.

Zeus tries to disinvite Eris, the spirit of strife, or discord, from the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, just as he arranged Thetis’s marriage to forestall the birth of a child of hers who might usurp his throne.

When Zeus tosses the golden apple off Mount Olympus, in a last-ditch attempt to preserve harmony, not even the gods foresee the consequences: ten years of war among gods and humans alike. What does this failure of foresight tell us about the limitations on the powers of the gods and the nature of the universe they inhabit? 3.

Whereas Achilles, Ajax, and their peers strive to win undying fame by displaying physical strength, courage, and fighting skill, Odysseus cultivates the qualities of intelligence and inge- nuity that will ensure his survival in a strange and unpredictable world. In a series of encounters with powerful women and goddesses, such as Circe, Calypso, and Athene, he further develops his native cunning and hones the skills that at last enable him to defeat his wife’s one hundred unwanted suitors and reunite with Penelope, his feminine counterpart, thus bringing this strand of the Troy saga to a peaceful conclusion. Dij|erences between the llidd and the Odyssey A popular Greek tradition accounts for differences between the Iliad and the Odyssey by assuming that the war poem was written in Homers youth while the generally peaceful world depicted in the story of Odysseus’s homecoming was a product of the poet’s old age. Noting the unusually large cast of female characters who play key roles in the Odyssey —from the goddess Athene to Odysseus’s aged nurse, Eurycleia— some modern critics suggest that the author is a woman. A few add that she even left a self-portrait in the figure of Nausicaa [nah-SIK-ay-a], a remarkably competent princess who acts as the hero’s patron at the court of her parents, King Alcinous [al- SIN-oh-uhs] and Queen Arete [a-REE-tee]. Whoever the poet(s) — the same person who wrote the Iliad ox an entire school of nameless geniuses—the Odyssey is a worthy sequel to the “Song of Ilium.” It contains an enormous mass of traditional material about the hero’s wanderings from Troy to 403"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"404 The Myth ic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes Ithaca, which the poet shapes into a smoothly flowing narrative that builds inexorably toward the climax of Odysseus’s long-delayed reunion with his wife, Penelope. Examining some differences between the two epics is instructive. In the Iliad, the action is concentrated along the narrow beaches where the Greek army is bivouacked or within the besieged city of Troy. In the Odyssey, the world opens up to encompass the entire Mediterranean basin, with the restless hero roaming from Asia Minor to Africa to Europe, encountering previously unknown peoples and strange customs. Odysseus even leaves the material realm behind, journeying to the murky kingdom of the dead. With the possible exceptions of Virgil’s Aeneid or Dante’s Divine Com- edy, no work of literature offers a more comprehensive tour of earth, heaven, and netherworld or a more dazzling parade of the gods, monsters, sorcerers, warriors, ghosts, heroes, and villains that inhabit mythology’s three-tier universe. Homer’s Structuring of the Odyssey The Iliad immediately introduces its two leading opponents, Achilles and Agamem- non, and pursues the consequences of their quarrel in generally chronological order straight through to the end of the poem. The Odysseys structure is more complex: the hero who gives the epic its name and who imprints the narrative with his distinc- tive personality does not appear until Book 5. Homer devotes the first four books to describing the effects in Ithaca of Odysseus’s nineteen-year absence and the quest that his son Telemachus [tee-LEM-a-kuhs] makes in search of his lost father. Apart from flashbacks recounting the hero’s earlier adventures, the action covers about six weeks: the time it takes Odysseus to leave Calypso’s island (where he has spent seven years as the goddess’s love slave), suffer a near-fatal shipwreck, wash ashore at the Phaeacians’ hospitable kingdom, be transported to Ithaca, and plot and execute his revenge on the hundred suitors who compete to replace him as king of Ithaca by marrying his wife, Penelope (Eigure 12-1). Although Zeus points out in Book 1 the cause of Poseidon’s hostility, which delays Odysseus’s homecoming by ten years, we do not learn exactly how or why the hero blinded the sea god’s son Polyphemus until almost the middle of the epic. To the Odysseys central section (Books 8—12), in which the ingenious hero nar- rates his own story, Homer relegates the poem’s most fantastic elements. Singing for his supper at the court of King Alcinous, Odysseus regales his audience with tales of man-eating giants, amorous nymphs, and messages from the recently dead, including Achilles and Agamemnon. Prom Book 13 to the poem’s conclusion, Odysseus is back in the familiar world of Ithacan politics, struggling to find a way to defeat the suitors and resume his mundane duties as husband, father, and king. In these later scenes of pragmatic conflict, the supernatural is represented only by the Olympians, rational administrators of the daylight world. Demodocus: The Blind Singer Some ancient commentators believed that, in his portrayal of Demodocus [de- MAH-dah-kuhs], the blind poet whose songs delight the Phaeacian court (Book 8), Homer created an idealized self-portrait. Although the tradition that Homer was blind may derive from Demodocus’s sightlessness, few modern critics take Homer’s description of the Phaeacian bard as autobiographical.

The Muse who lavishes “matchless love” on Demodocus and inspires his incomparable poetry also robs him of his eyes. The Odysseys author, how- ever, certainly presents Demodocus as a supreme artist who deserves all the honor and respect that King Alcinous and his courtiers bestow on him. Odysseus remarks that Demodocus’s poetic skills are so great that either Apollo or the Muse herself must have taught the poet his art. Homer’s description of Demodocus’s creative role offers an important glimpse into the creative process by which Greek minstrels fashioned epics. In the first of three poems Demodocus recites, accompanied on his harp, he celebrates “men of glory, men whose deeds were chanted in a song whose fame had reached vast heaven.” The bard’s function is indispensable if a hero’s “glory” is to last: the accomplishments of an Achilles will be remembered only when a great poet recounts them in immortal verse. In his second poem, Demodocus moves from heroes to gods, singing of the adulterous love of Ares and Aphrodite, a theme that evokes Paris’s illicit affair with Helen, the cause of the Trojan War. (See Chapter 5 for the text of Demodocus’s song of Ares and Aphrodite.) His third poem, recounting Odysseus’s infamous ruse of the wooden horse, serves multiple purposes: besides refocusing narrative attention on Odysseus and crediting him for the long-delayed Greek victory, it skillfully advances Homer’s plot. Until Demodocus sings of the Trojan Horse, Odysseus remained an anonymous stranger at the Phaeacian court; his tearful response to the minstrel’s art motivates him to reveal his identity as the hero whose peerless ingenuity Demodocus had praised. When Alcinous recognizes his guest as the instrument of Troy’s fall, he provides Odysseus with a Phaeacian ship that transports the hero back to Ithaca. A Different Kind of Hero Whereas numerous aristocratic warriors contend for our interest in the Iliad, a single personality dominates the Odyssey. All other characters, from the doting Athene to the cannibalistic Laestrygonians, are defined exclusively by their relationship to Odysseus. Odysseus has the courage, fighting skills, and leadership abilities that char- acterize the epic hero, but he is defined primarily by the extraordinary intelligence that equips him to cope with unexpected and dangerous situations away from the battlefield. He also differs from his colleagues at Troy in his emphasis on solving problems through cunning and strategy rather than brute force. His most famous ruse, the Trojan Horse (which Demodocus describes in Book 8), results in the cap- ture of Troy when direct attacks and military brawn fail. Greek myth customarily explains the hero’s superiority by making him the de- scendant of a god. Although Odysseus, unlike Achilles, has two mortal parents, Laertes [lay-ER-teez] andAnticleia [an-tih-KLEE-a], non-Homeric tradition assigns him a divine ancestor in Autolycus [ah-TUHL-ih-kuhs], his maternal grandfather. Reputedly a son of Hermes, Autolycus embodies some of his father’s less desirable attributes, including a penchant for thievery and deception, qualities some later writ- ers, such as Sophocles, also ascribe to Odysseus. As Homer portrays him, however, Odysseus is entirely human, making his refusal when the nymph Calypso offers him immortality all the more significant (Book 5)."},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"A Different Kind of Hero 407 The Sequence of Events in the Homeward Voyage of Odysseus After Odysseus’s ruse of the wooden horse results in Troys fall (c. 1250-1200 B.C.), Odysseus and his men set sail for Ithaca. 1.

Odysseus comes ashore on the island of Scheria, the kingdom of the Phaea- cians ruled by King Alcinous and Queen Arete, whose sailors transport the hero back to Ithaca. Brains versus Brawn Distinguished by brains rather than an exceptional physique, Odysseus lacks Achilles’ commanding height and good looks (Figure 12-2). He has the physical power to string a huge bow that other men cannot even bend (Book 21), and he competes successfully with younger athletes at AJcinous’s court, but this middle-aged hero must rely on Athene to apply a divine cosmetic that makes him appear taller and handsomer whenever he needs to make a good impression. When circumstances dictate, Athene also changes Odysseus’s appearance for the worse, withering his skin to make his disguise as an aged beggar more convincing. These physical transformations, repeated throughout the epic, suggest Odysseus’s chame- leonlike traits, his uncanny ability to take on a variety of roles, from commander and king to pauper and suppliant."},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"408 The Mythic World of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes FIGURE 12-2 The Head of Odysseus.

In this portrait of the experience-weary Odys- seus, the sculptor suggests both the physical strain caused by the hero’s labors and his resolve to take on new challenges. (Archaeo- logical Museum, Sperlonga) Differences between Achilles and Odysseus run more than skin deep. Whereas Achilles represents the aristocratic warrior, an archetypal ephebe whose chief attri- butes are strength, martial skill, and courage, Odysseus manifests the less spectacular quality of seasoned prudence. The ability to exercise foresight, discretion, and ratio- nal self-control, prudence is the trait that most commonly (but not always) distin- guishes Odysseus’s behavior. Whereas Achilles’ brawn and bloodlust well suit his mili- tary career, Odysseus’s quick-witted caution proves crucial in negotiating the obstacles, temptations, and dangers that the gods strew, like so many land mines, along his path through the postwar world. The Iliad's warrior-heroes, obsessively competing for personal glory, condemn themselves to early deaths. Sacrificing their future is a necessary price for the post- humous fame that poets, singing of their prowess in war, eventually bestow on them. The shrewd, aging hero of the Odyssey, however, is not predestined to share the tragic end of Achilles and his comrades. In the epic’s opening scene, set on Mount Olym- pus, Zeus promises Athene that her beloved Odysseus will safely reach Ithaca. Even Poseidon, who persecutes Odysseus for his mutilation of Polyphemus, cannot resist the collective will of the other Olympians. Zeus’s first words sound a theme of heavenly justice that shapes the Odysseys moral universe. Mortals, he says, blame the gods for their troubles, but in reality people bring suffering on themselves, far exceeding the lot—the mixture of good and evil apportioned to each person—that Necessity decrees. Zeus then cites the example"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"A Dijferent Kind of Hero 409 FIGURE 12-3 The Head of Zeus. In the Odyssey, Zeus enforces the principles of cosmic justice, punishing such lawbreakers as the suit- ors and assuring Athene that her protege Odysseus will safely regain his rightful place at Ithaca. Odysseus’s marked reverence for the gods and his resourcefulness and persistence ensure that, in spite of considerable pain and suffering, he will survive and reach his goal. Unlike the tragic vision of the Iliad, in which death claims even the best and bravest, the Od- yssey presents a relatively op- timistic worldview, albeit one shadowed by the pros- pect of a grim afterlife in Hades’ realm (see Book 11).

As a result, Aegisthus is slain by Orestes [ah-RES-teez] (the son of Agamemnon and Clytemnes- tra), who boldly avenges his father’s death, an act of filial devotion that the gods heartily approve. Zeus’s remarks introduce three important issues: first, if the suitors succeed in their plot to kill Odysseus, Telemachus will be called on to reenact Orestes’ vengeance; second, like Aegisthus, Odysseus will cause many of his own problems; and finally, the Olympians govern the world according to a principle of retributive justice that rewards persons honoring divine law and punishes the disobedient. Cosmic balance is maintained by ensuring that every crime is paid for by an appropriate punishment. The gods also distinguish among degrees of guilt: Odysseus’s men, who deliberately break a divine prohibition, forfeit their lives, whereas Odysseus, who also suffers for his mistakes, avoids directly offending Zeus and survives (Figure 12-3). Odysseus’s Error with Polyphemus Zeus does not mention Odysseus’s partial re- sponsibility for his delayed homecoming, but the hero later confesses that at least once he violated his own standards of prudence, with disastrous results.

In the Odysseys opening pages, Zeus warns that humans bring greater sorrows on them- selves than Necessity decrees, a truth illustrated by the hero’s behavior with the Cy- clops Polyphemus. Forget- ting that a military leader must always plan ahead for possible retreat, Odysseus guides his men into a fatal trap, the cannibal Cyclops’s cave. Although he devises a means of blinding Polyphe- mus and escaping with the men the giant had not yet eaten, Odysseus compounds his errors by boasting of his cleverness to the Cyclops and revealing his hitherto concealed identity, a burst of hubris (excessive pride) that brings the curse of Poseidon on him. Because of this uncharacteristic rashness, Odysseus suffers a ten-year delay in his homecoming, as well as the loss of his men.

After getting the monster drunk and blinding him (Figure 12-4), Odysseus then devises a way to escape the cave by tying his companions and himself to the undersides of Polyphemus’s rams (Figure 12-5). Proud to have blinded Polyphemus and escaped alive, Odysseus temporarily acts as if he has lost his wits: boasting of his cleverness, he abandons the protective alias he has used, announcing to the infuriated Cyclops that, far from being a “no-one,” he has a famous identity, and he proceeds to divulge both his name and his address. The Cyclops’s prayer to his father, Posei- don, is immediately granted: Odysseus will suffer an agonizing ten-year delay in reaching home, the loss of all his men, and the certainty of great trouble on arriving in Ithaca. The Polyphemus episode throws a long shadow over Odysseus’s career, eventu- ally necessitating his journey to Fdades to consult the blind prophet Tiresias [tih- REE-sih-as] about the future consequences of his recklessness (Book 11). Alerted to the self-destructive aspects of his nature—the impulsive pride that subverts his ratio- nal control— Odysseus henceforth behaves with redoubled prudence. By cautiously anchoring his vessel a safe distance off an unfamiliar shore, he escapes the fate of his men when the Laestrygonians destroy their eleven ships (Figure 12-6).

Athene: Wise Guide and Mentor Odysseus’s exceptionally intimate relationship with his divine patron is virtually unique in Greek myth. When the two, both in disguise, meet on the beach near Ithaca, each one delights in the other’s efforts to deceive (Book 13). The phenome- non of a mortal successfully matching wits with the goddess of wisdom elicits Athene’s unstinted praise: “You are by far the best of mortals in [deceitful] plans and [false] stories, and I among all the gods am famed for planning and shrewdness.” The affinity between Athene and Odysseus surpasses their shared attribute of mental agility, for man and goddess both set intellect to work, manipulating others to further their own private agendas (Figure 12-7). As Athene maneuvers Zeus into circum- venting Poseidon’s vendetta, so Odysseus artfully exploits the suitors’ drunken over- confidence to arrange his revenge. As giver of victory, Athene helps Odysseus plan his strategy—the reconquest of Ithaca—but, goddesslike, she does not actively in- tervene during his hand-to-hand battle with the suitors until he has already demon- strated both the will and the ability to win.

In this episode with the canni- balistic Laestrygonians, Odysseus demonstrates that he has learned from his earlier encounter with Polyphemus. Whereas Odysseus thoughtlessly had led his men into the Cyclops’s cave without bothering to learn anything of his putative host’s disposition, he now approaches the unknown with caution. By anchoring his ship a safe distance offshore, Odysseus and his crew escape the fate of the rest of his fleet, who imprudently moor their vessels along the beach and are destroyed when the giant Laestrygonians smash their ships with huge boulders.

Odysseus and Images of the Feminine Circe Almost every stage of Odysseus’s voyage is marked by an encounter with a woman or a goddess, each of whom typically first challenges and then assists the hero. After escaping the Laestrygonians, Odysseus’s next adventure takes place on the island of Circe [SIR-see], an enchantress who turns men into swine. Like the demigoddess Calypso, who will later hold Odysseus in thrall for seven long years, Circe is a pow- erful female who threatens the hero’s masculine identity because she plies the art of reducing human males to the lowest common denominator, their animal natures.

It is significant that the only two occasions on which the grand patriarch Zeus sends his male emissary (Hermes) to aid Odysseus occur when the hero’s masculine autonomy is jeopardized by a captivating female. Hermes rushes to Odysseus’s side the moment he sets foot in Circe’s dangerous terrain, giving him a mythical herb, the moly plant, to counteract the effect of her magic, thus protecting him from loss of manhood. As a wise manifestation of the ancient Goddess, Circe soon becomes Odysseus’s host, lover, and guide. Once Odysseus has demonstrated his ability to resist her ma- nipulation and claimed the right to assert his own maleness (threatening her with his phallic sword), Circe freely accepts him as her equal partner. Functioning as an aspect of his anima (Penelope is its full expression), Circe imparts the secret knowledge of such chthonic goddesses as Gaea, Demeter, and Persephone. Circe reveals the hidden path to the Underworld (Figure 12-8), instructing Odysseus in the sacred rituals necessary to consult the dead and enabling him to complete the rite of passage in which he undergoes symbolic death and rebirth (Books 10 — 12).

A later narrative poem, the Telegonia (ascribed to Eugammon of Gyrene and known only from brief summaries), states that after sacrificing to Hades, Persephone, and Tiresias (denizens of the Underworld to which Odysseus’s bloody revenge had consigned the suitors), Odysseus leaves Ith- aca and travels to Thesprotia, where he makes his obligatory peace offering to Poseidon. While among the Thesprotians (people of mythic King Thesprotus), Odysseus becomes the lover of Callidice, queen of the region, who gives birth to their son, Polypoetes. When Callidice dies, Odysseus turns the kingdom over to the young Polypoetes and returns home to Ithaca, where he finds that Penelope has borne him a second son, Poliporthes. In the meantime, Odysseus’s son by Circe, Telegonus (not mentioned in Homer but noted in Hesiod’s Theogony)^ has gone in search of his father (reenacting Te- lemachus’s quest in the Odyssey). MIQ.X landing in Ithaca and raiding its cattle, Telegonus is beset by Ithacan herdsmen, who are aided by their king, Odysseus. Unaware of his father’s identity, Telegonus kills Odysseus with a spear tipped with the poisonous tail of a stingray, only to be overcome with remorse when he learns whom he has slain. (Tiresias’s prophecy that Odysseus will not die at sea is thus given an ironic twist: the hero is killed on land by the venom of a sea creature.) Telegonus then flees to Circe’s island, taking Odysseus’s body, Penelope, and his half-brother Telemachus with him. After Circe makes them immortal, Telegonus marries Penelope and Telemachus marries Circe. In one variant of the tradition, Circe restores Odysseus to life and, after dispatching Penelope and Odysseus’s two sons to the Isles of the Blest (see Chapter 9), Circe at last marries the hero herself. Other post-Homeric variations of the myth focus on Penelope’s fate. Apollo- dorus cites a tradition in which Penelope is seduced by Antinous, her most aggres- sive suitor, for which Odysseus sends her back to her father, Icarius, where she becomes Hermes’ mistress and gives birth to the rustic god Pan. Some later poets claim that Pan, a figure of unbridled lust, was the result of an orgy in which Pe- nelope coupled with ^//of her hundred suitors—a gratuitous slander against Ho- mer’s portrait of human fidelity.

When the son of this union, Euryalus, grows up, his mother sends him to Ithaca with sealed proofs of his parentage. Odysseus is not at home when Eury- alus arrives. Penelope, recognizing in him the illegitimate child of a rival, later jeal- ously persuades her husband that the youth is a threat to his life. Reverting to his earlier imprudent conduct, Odysseus impulsively kills the stranger, thus becoming guilty of his sons murder. Some Athenian dramatists were extremely critical of Odysseus’s ethical charac- ter. In his tragedy Philoctetes, Sophocles portrays Odysseus as an amoral example of middle-aged expediency. After receiving an oracle that only possession of Heracles’ famous bow can ensure the Greeks’ victory at Troy, Odysseus does not hesitate to manipulate Achilles’ naive son, Neoptolemus, into inadvertently deceiving the wounded Philoctetes, whom the Greeks had previously abandoned on the island of Lemnos, persuading him to relinquish Heracles’ bow. As this cursory sampling of post-Homeric myth indicates, Greek and Roman writers delighted in spinning endless new tales about Odysseus and his diverse es- capades. A quintessentially human paradox of intelligence and passion, foresight and recklessness, Odysseus continued to fascinate the European imagination long after the fall of Rome. For Dante, the supreme poet of medieval Roman Catholi- cism, Odysseus (Ulysses) symbolizes the pride of intellect that drives men to violate God-ordained boundaries. In Dante’s Inferno (Canto 26; see the reading in Chap- ter 21), the poet imagines Odysseus’s last journey into realms never before explored by mortals, an impious ambition that Christendom’s God punishes in hell. By con- trast, in a poem written in 1842, the English poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson, depicts the aged Greek hero as embodying a modern spirit of scientific heroism, his insa- tiable thirst to experience new life representing the finest of human aspiration (see the reading in Chapter 21). Homer’s successors, ancient and modern, present an enormous range of possible fates for Odysseus after his return to Ithaca. As Hesiod’s evolving cosmos is a seed- bed of almost unlimited potential, so Odysseus’s multifaceted character presents endless opportunities for further development. Inhabiting a timeless dimension limited only by the human imagination, he confronts an open-ended universe, si- multaneously journeying through parallel worlds and creating a legion of selves acting out their individual destinies. In his infinite variety—transcending time and culture—Odysseus illustrates the boundless exuberance of the mythical hero. perion. The men, becalmed for weeks on an inhospitable island, give in to their physical appetites, slaughtering and feasting on the sun god’s property, an impious act that Zeus punishes by later incinerating their ship with his thunderbolt. Only Odysseus, wise enough to sacrifice his immediate well-being in order to win the gods’ approval, survives Zeus’s wrath.

Although Circe at first appears as a threat to Odysseus’s manhood, she becomes his partner and guide, wisely preparing him to avoid the dangers and pitfalls he must encounter on subsequent wanderings.

(William Amory Gardner Fund. Gourtesy, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston) Calypso In contrast to Circe, who coolly relinquishes her lover as soon as he asks to leave, Calypso represents a diflferent threat to Odysseus’s psyche—the demands of untrammeled female sexuality. Although it may seem that Odysseus has found para- dise with a goddess who drags him to her bed every night for seven years, we must remember that the hero is no longer a young man of unlimited virility. Besides the potentially castrating effects of Calypso’s dominance, Odysseus—imprisoned on an island literally in the middle of nowhere—is deprived of the normal challenges and opportunities that society affords. A Greek hero cannot fulfill his destiny in total isolation from other human beings. Calypso’s outrage when Hermes brings Zeus’s command—given at Athene’s urg- ing— to release Odysseus reflects a female deity’s deep resentment at the Olympian autocracy. Some critics view Calypso’s offer to make Odysseus immortal as the echo of a prehistoric rite in which the Goddess’s male consort was sacrificed, his shed blood fertilizing the ground and enhancing Gaea’s fecundity. As in the Heracles myth, a hero’s immortality is attained only after death and transfiguration, a posthumous dei- fication that Odysseus rejects.

After his prolonged contact with the wisdom of figures like Circe, Odysseus chooses to remain fixed in the earthly life cycle that includes aging and death, the wise acceptance of natural law expressed by the Great Goddess (see Chapter 4). In his close rapport with goddesses and his employment of their gifts, Odysseus is reminiscent of earlier heroes, such as Perseus and Fferacles. Like Fieracles, another of Athene’s select favorites, Odysseus is associated with a bow that only he can utilize and with a perilous journey into Hades’ kingdom, a parallel that Homer underscores at the climax of Book 11. Combining the best traits of Perseus and Heracles, Odys- seus exceeds them in the intense solitariness of his quest: no other Greek hero is more completely alone, deals with more terrifying supernatural forces, develops a higher degree of self-reliance, or returns to his place of origin with greater insight than Odys- seus.

The key difference in this equation is Penelope’s distinctive character, which makes her far more than a conventional model of the submissive and patient wife. As intelligent, perceptive, and resourceful as her husband, she shares Odysseus’s prudence and inventiveness, demonstrated by her delaying tactics with the suitors: her feigned promise to marry as soon as she finishes weaving a burial shroud for Laertes (Figure 12-11)—which she covertly unravels at night—keeps the suitors at bay for years. Penelope’s ability to test men’s mettle ranges from the deadly trial of skill she sets up for the suitors to a final ruse about the immovability of her marriage bed. fder use of this image—a place of sexual union secretly fashioned from the trunk of an olive tree, Athene’s unique gift to the Greeks—suggests Penelope’s association with peaceful fecundity, a benevolent expression of the same qualities that Circe and Calypso represent, but without the attendant danger. As weaver, keeper of nuptial secrets, and guardian of an olive trunk symbolizing the Tree of Life, Penelope implicitly functions as a priestess of the ancient Goddess. Her characteristic task of weaving also links Penelope to the feminine aspects of Athene, who is patron of women’s handicrafts and protector of the home.

Poseidon will set aside his anger; certainly he cannot have his way, for he is only one god against us all, and we are many.” Athena, gray-eyed goddess, answered him: “Our father, Cronos’ son, you, lord of lords, ilO if now the blessed gods indeed would end the wanderings of Odysseus, let us send the keen-eyed Hermes to Calypso’s isle, Ogygia. Let him there at once declare to her, the goddess with the lovely hair, our undeniable decree: Steadfast Odysseus is to find his homeward path. But I shall make my way to Ithaca at once, to give his son the strength to summon the long-haired Ithacans; when they assemble 120 he can denounce—and scatter—all the suitors: they are forever slaughtering his sheep, his shambling oxen with their curving horns. Then off to sandy Pylos and to Sparta I’ll send him to seek tidings of his father’s return; he may yet hear some hopeful word— and men will then commend him for his search.”"},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"424 HOMER That said, Athena fastened on fine sandals: these—golden, everlasting—carried her with swift winds over seas and endless lands. 130 The goddess took her bronze-tipped battle lance, heavy and huge and solid; with this shaft, she—daughter of so great a force—can smash the ranks of warriors whoVe earned her wrath. One leap — and from Olympus’ peaks she reached the land of Ithaca. She stood before Odysseus’ door, the threshold of his court. She gripped the bronze-tipped shaft, and taking on the likeness of a stranger, she became lord Mentes, chieftain of the Taphians. 140 She found the braggart suitors at the gate. Delighting in their dicing, they reclined on hides of oxen they themselves had skinned— with pages and attendants serving them, some mixing wine and water in wide bowls, while others washed the tables down with sponges and readied them for food, and others still stacked meat in heaps on platters—high and full. The very first to notice Mentes’ presence was young Telemachus. He—sad, morose— 150 sat with the suitors. In his reverie, he saw his sturdy father—would that he, returning suddenly, might banish these intruders from his palace and restore the rights and rule that had been his before. Such was the sadness of Telemachus, alone among the suitors, till he saw Athena; he rushed toward the outer door, ashamed that none had gone to greet the stranger. He drew near, clasped her right hand, even as 160 his left relieved her of the heavy lance. And when he spoke, his words were like winged shafts: “My greetings, stranger. Welcome to our feast. Eat first—and then do tell us what you seek.” He led the way; Athena followed him. Once they were in the high-roofed hall, he placed her lance against a column at whose base a polished rack, with slots for spears, was set; within that rack there stood still other shafts, the many spears that brave Odysseus left. 170 He led the stranger to a tall chair, wrought with care; across its frame he spread rich cloth. There he invited her to sit and rest"},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"ODYSSEY 425 her feet upon a stool; and he himself sat nearby, on another well-carved chair, set far off from the suitors, lest his guest, in all that brouhaha, might look askance at feasting with such overbearing men— and, too, because he wanted so to gather what news he could about his distant father. 180 That they might wash their hands, a servant poured fresh water from a lovely golden jug into a silver basin; at their side she placed a polished table. The old housewife was generous: she drew on lavish stores; to each of them she offered much and more. The carver offered meats of every sort, and for their wine he set out golden cups; and these—again, again—a page filled up. But then the suitors swaggered in; they sat, 190 in order, on low seats and high-backed chairs. The pages poured fresh water for their hands, and servants brought them baskets heaped with bread. The suitors’ hands reached out. The feast was theirs. When they had had their fill of food and drink, the feasters felt the need for chant and dance— at banquets, these are pleasing ornaments. A steward now consigned a handsome harp into the hands of Phemius, who was forced, from time to time, to entertain those lords. 200 He struck the strings, and music graced his words. Then, as Telemachus turned toward his guest, lest he be overheard, he held his head close to the gray-eyed goddess—and he said: “Dear guest, will you be vexed at what I say? This harping and this chant delight these men, for all these goods come easily to them: they feed—but never need to recompense. They feast at the expense of one whose white bones, surely, either rot beneath the rain, 210 unburied and abandoned on the land, or else are preyed upon by churning waves.

The day of his homecoming is lost: it is a day we’ll never see. 220 But tell me one thing—tell me honestly: Who are you? Of what father were you born? Where is your city, where your family? On what ship did you sail? Why did that crew bring you to Ithaca? And who were they? For surely you did not come here on foot! And also tell me truthfully—is this the hrst time you have come to Ithaca, or have you been my father’s guest before? For many other foreigners have come 230 to visit us—like you, my father knew the ways of many men and many lands.” Athena, gray-eyed goddess, answered him: “My words to you are true: I’m Mentes, son of wise Anchialus; the Taphians, tenacious oarsmen, are the men I rule. Now I have landed here with ship and crew; we cross the winedark sea toward Temese— all this in search of copper. What we stow is gleaming iron, which we’re set to barter. 240 Outside the city, moored in Rheithron’s harbor, close to the fields, beneath Mount Neion’s forest, my ship is waiting.

But since then I have not seen him, and he has not seen me.” Telemachus’ reply was keen and wise: “Dear friend, I cannot be more frank than this. My mother says I am his son, but none can know for sure the seed from which he’s sprung. In any case, would I had been the son of one so blessed that he grew old among his own belongings. I, instead, am born— 280 or so they say— of one who surely was the most forsaken man, the most forlorn.

But tell me truthfully: What sort of feast is this? A banquet? Or a wedding party? This surely is no meal where each has brought 290 his share. Why did this crowd seek out your house? These guzzlers seem to me no better than a pack of swaggerers—too rude, too coarse. Seeing their shameful doings, any man of sense would feel both anger and contempt.” Telemachus’ response was wise, precise: “Dear guest, to all you ask, I now reply. I tell you that as long as he, my father, was in his native land, this house was rich and great. But then the gods willed otherwise— 300 they made my father vanish: they devised oblivion for him—much deeper than oblivion known by any other man. And though he’s dead, my grief would be less deep if he had fallen in the land of Troy, among his fellow warriors, or else— once he had wound up all the threads of war— had died at home, among his very own.

All lords with power in these isles—who rule Dulichium and Samos and Zacynthus, the wooded isle, and those who now presume 320 to rule in rocky Ithaca—continue to woo my mother and consume my goods. She’ll not reject the hateful wedding or accept it. Meanwhile all their gluttony lays waste my house; they soon will ruin me.” Pallas Athena, now incensed, replied: “The absent one, Odysseus, is indeed the man whom you, unhappy son, could use: he’d break the back of this marauding band. Would he—returned—were now to take his stand 330 upon the threshold with his helmet, shield, and pair of spears—the mighty man that I first saw on his way back from fiphyre, the land of flus, son of Mermerus; along his homeward way, he stayed with us— I saw him drinking, feasting, in our house.

Sail first to Pylos: question noble Nestor. Then visit Sparta’s king, blond Menelaus: 370 of all Achseans clad in bronze, he was the last to reach his home. If you should hear word that your father is still alive and steers a homeward path, then—though you are much tried— you surely can hold out for one more year. But if you learn that he has died, return to your dear land and raise a mound for him; complete a just, unstinting funeral, then marry off your mother to some man: you will have done all that you should—and can. 380 But then weigh carefully in mind and soul how best to kill the suitors in your halls — by way of open combat or of guile.

BOOKS 2-4 [Aware that Telemachus has now matured sufficiently to pose a threat to their plans, the suitors conspire to get rid of him. Prompted by Athene, Telemachus leaves Ithaca to search for news of his father, traveling first to the court of old King Nestor at Pylos and then, accompanied by Nestor’s son Pisistratus, visiting Sparta and hearing his fa- ther’s praises sung by Menelaus and Helen. With Athene’s help, Telemachus will escape the suitors’ ambush and return unharmed to Ithaca.] BOOK 5 [While Telemachus gathers testimony about his father’s heroic reputation, Odysseus re- mains trapped on Calypso’s remote island, Ogygia, where for seven years he has nightly made love to the amorous nymph and spent his empty days weeping for home. Dis- patched at Athene’s request, Hermes appears to order Calypso to free her reluctant lover:] The gods, convened in council, sat with Zeus, i the thunder lord, whose force is absolute. To them, Athena, as she called to mind Odysseus’ many miseries, defined the threats that lay in wait, the troubling fate he faced as captive in Calypso’s cave: “You, father Zeus, and all of this assembly of blessed, never-dying gods, hear me: From this time on, no sceptered king need be benign and kind, a man of righteous mind: 10 let kings be cruel and corrupt, malign— for none among his people now recall divine Odysseus, though his rule was gentle and fatherly. And now, against his will. Calypso keeps him captive in her grotto, her island home, where he can only sorrow."},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"ODYSSEY 431 And he cannot return to his own land: he has no ships at hand, no oars, no friends to carry him across the sea’s broad back. Now, too, they mean to ambush his dear son, to murder him along his homeward run; for news of his dear father, he has gone to sacred Pylos and bright Laced^mon.” Zeus, shepherd of the clouds, replied: “My daughter, how can the barrier of your teeth permit such words to cross your lips? For surely this delay—to keep Odysseus far away until on his return he takes revenge against the suitors—is the scheme you planned. As for Telemachus, your cunning can return him to his land on safe sea paths, and you can thwart the suitors’ plot, so that those baffled men retreat with empty hands.” That said, he turned to Hermes, his dear son: “Yes, you have served us well on many missions. Go now, and tell the nymph with lovely hair that this is our infallible decree: Odysseus is to reach his home, though he must sail alone, without the company of gods or men. His craft will be makeshift, planks bound by many thongs; in such a ship, his crossing will be trying, tiring, yet when twenty days have passed, that man of wiles will reach Scheria’s fertile soil, the isle of the Phaeacians, men the gods befriend. There they will honor him with willing hearts, as if he were a god. They will escort Odysseus to his homeland in their ship, with bronze and gold and clothes—so many gifts: after the sack of Troy, had he sailed back directly, with his share of spoils intact, not even then would he have been that rich. Such is the destined way in which he’ll come to his own land, his friends, his high-roofed home.” That said, the keen-eyed messenger was quick. First, to his feet he fastened handsome sandals: these, golden, everlasting, carried him with swift winds over seas and endless land. He took the wand that charms the eyes of men: some, he enchants with sleep, just as he can, at will, awaken others. Wand in hand, Hermes took flight. He passed Pieria’s peaks 20 30 40 50 60"},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"432 HOMER and, from the upper air, swooped toward the waves; then, like a bird, he skimmed—a tern that bathes its thick wings in the brine as it hunts fish in surge that never rests—the dread abyss. So Hermes rode the countless troughs and crests. At last he reached landfall, the distant isle. He quit the violet waves. He made his way on land and found the fair-haired nymph’s deep cave. 70 She was at home. A splendid fire blazed upon her hearth; its fragrance wafted far across the isle—the scent of burning logs of juniper and tender thuja boughs. Inside that grotto, with her golden shuttle, the nymph was weaving; moving back and forth before her loom, she sang—her voice was graceful. The grotto was surrounded by rich forests: alder and poplar trees and pungent cypress. There broad-winged birds built nests: owls, cormorants, 80 and chattering sea crows, who ply their tasks among the waves. The grotto’s entranceway was ringed by robust vines with clustered grapes. Pure water rose from four springs in a row, but then, meandering, the four streams flowed through gentle fields of violets and parsley. Even a god who chanced to see that site would feel the force of wonder and delight. But when his mind had marveled at it all, he went at once into the spacious cave. 90 Calypso, brightest goddess, seeing Hermes, did not have any doubts: the deathless gods can recognize each other, even when their dwelling places lie so far apart. Yet generous Odysseus was not there, but where he always sat, along the shore, sighing and weeping, grieving as he tore his heart and watched the restless sea. Calypso sat Hermes on a gleaming chair, then asked: “Hermes, my honored guest—a welcome one— lOO what matter brings you here with your gold wand? You’ve hardly been a frequent visitor.

So Hermes ate and drank, and when his soul had been refreshed with food, this was his answer: no “You ask—as goddess to a god—why I am here, and you do not want me to lie. Zeus ordered me to come, against my will: who’d want to cross an endless stretch of brine? Who’d want to find no mortals’ town nearby where men, to please a god, may sacrifice choice hecatombs, roast thighs that so delight? And yet there is no god that can elude or slight the will of aegis-bearing Zeus. He says there is a man with you, a man 120 most miserable, one of those who fought nine years for Priam’s citadel, then sacked that stronghold in the tenth year and sailed back. But since his men had sinned against Athena, she sent harsh winds, harsh seas, as punishment. Then all of his brave comrades died, but he, impelled by wind and wave, has reached your realm. Now Zeus would have you send him home at once: his fate is not to die here, far from friends— he is to see his dear ones, find again 130 his high-roofed house, return to his own land.” These were his words. The lovely goddess shuddered, then answered Hermes with her own winged words: “You gods are cruel and more jealous than all others: if a goddess beds a man and wants him—openly—as her dear husband, then you begrudge her that. Your envy punished rose-fingered Dawn when she embraced Orion: you gods, at ease, your least desire appeased, sent down chaste Artemis of the gold throne, 140 and she, in Delos, killed him with her shafts. And when fair-haired Demeter dared to clasp lasion (they mingled, breast to breast, upon a field where plows had worked three furrows), Zeus did not wait too long to find that out, to kill him with a blazing thunderbolt. So now, you gods resent my having chosen a mortal.

Yet I am fully ready to advise him, keep nothing hidden from him, so that he may make his way back to his own land—safely.” Stout Hermes said: “However this may be, take care to send him off at once. Beware of Zeus’s wrath, lest in the future he become your unforgiving enemy.” Then sturdy Hermes left. And having heard the message sent by Zeus, the bright nymph went 170 to generous Odysseus. He was seated along the shore; his eyes were never dry, and his sweet life was squandered as he wept for his dear home; he now took no delight in her: the nymph no longer pleased his sight. By night, indeed, within Calypso’s cave, he slept with her: so side by side they lay, the willing and unwilling. But by day, his heart was rent by torment as he sat along the sands or on the rocks; he watched 180 the never-resting sea and, watching, wept. Standing beside him there, the fair nymph said: “Unhappy man, don’t stay—in tears—with me: do not destroy your life. Most willingly I set you free. Come now, with your bronze ax chop down stout trunks and build a broad-beamed craft. Let cross-planks serve as sides for those base beams, to carry you across the fog-dark sea.

Her reply was this: “You are indeed astute, not short on wits: what cunning urged you on to this request? I call as witnesses the spacious sky 210 and earth and waves of Styx that flow below— the most exacting, the most awesome oath the blessed gods can swear—that I forgo all thought of any future harm to you. My thoughts, my plans for you, are only such as I myself might seek were I to be in your own place: within my breast I keep no heart of iron—I feel for you, your needs.” That said, the lovely goddess led. He followed her quick footsteps. Together, man and goddess, 220 they reached the hollow grotto. There he sat on the same chair that Hermes had just left. Calypso set before him food and drink of every sort that suits a mortals needs. Then she sat opposite the bright Odysseus. Her handmaids oflFered her ambrosia and nectar. Their fare was ready now. Their hands reached out. And when their thirst and hunger were appeased, the lovely goddess was the first to speak: “Are you, Odysseus, man of many wiles, 230 Laertes’ godly son, still keen to leave straightway?

Even so, each day 250 I hope and hunger for my house: I long to see the day of my returning home. If once again, upon the winedark sea, a god attacks, I shall survive that loss: the heart within my chest is used to patience.

And they, within the hollow of the cave, 260 taking delight in love, together lay. BOOKS 6-8 lAfter building a raft and leaving Calypso, Odysseus sails the open sea for seventeen days, at last coming in sight of the island of Scheria, land of the Phaeacians. When Po- seidon, returning from Ethiopia, observes his enemy approaching land, the angry god raises a storm that destroys Odysseus’s raft.

He asked for more: ‘Come now, good fellow, fill it up again. And do tell me straightway what your name is: I’ll give you, as my guest, a pleasing gift. Surely the earth, giver of grain, provides the Cyclops with fine wine, and rain from Zeus does well our clustered vines. But this is better— a wine as fragrant as ambrosia and nectar.’ “These were his words. Again I poured dark wine. Three times I offered it and—stupidly— three times he drank it down. But when it wound its way around his wits, I said most gently: “‘Cyclops, you ask me for my noted name; I’ll tell it to you if in recompense you keep your promise and I get that present. My name is No-one; No-one—so I’m called by both my mother and my father, and all my comrades.’ “This I said. And he replied: ‘No-one, your friends come first; I’ll eat you last. This is the gift I give to you, my guest.’ “That said, the Cyclops reeled, his hulk collapsed; he fell upon his back, with his thick neck aslant; sleep, lord of all, now held him fast. Up from his gullet, bits of human flesh and wine were gushing: in his drunken sleep, he’d vomited. Now it was time to thrust the stake into heaped cinders: it grew hot. I spurred on all my men with words of hope, that none might flinch with fear. And when that stake of olive-wood, though green, was glowing, just about to blaze, I drew it from the flames. My men stood round me; into us a god breathed daring. And they clasped that pointed stake, then drove the olive-wood into his eye. I, reaching high, my weight thrown from above, now whirled that stake around, as one whose bore drills deep into the timber of a ship, while those below him twirl it with a thong they grasp at either end; the drill whirls round and never rests.

His howl was terrifying; all the rocks rang out. Fear drove us back. The stake, which he tugged out, was fouled with blood. And—crazed—he threw it far; and then he shouted to the other Cyclops, who lived in nearby caves on windswept hilltops. They heard his call and, coming from all sides, stood near his cave and asked what was awry: “ ‘What struck you, Polyphemus? Why do you disturb the godlike night and spoil our sleep? What mortal can, against your will, drive off your flocks or try with treachery or force to kill you?’ “Polyphemus, from the cave, replied: ‘My friends, no force can damage me; No-one, No-one is using treachery.’ “They answered: ‘If no one is harming you, and you are all alone, it surely is some sickness sent by Zeus; you can’t elude that kind of malady. Pray to Poseidon, your father: he’s the one to call upon.’ “That said, they left. And my heart laughed: my name, a perfect snare, had trapped him. Racked by pain, the Cyclops moaned and groped for that great stone, then shoved it from the entranceway and sat with hands outstretched in hope that he might catch the men who, with the sheep, came from the cave— he must have thought my wits were dim and slack.

Three sheep for each of them, but I instead picked out the largest ram. I grabbed his back lOO and curled beneath his belly. There I grasped his splendid fleece; faceup, I held it tight. So, anxiously we waited for firstlight. “As soon as Dawn’s rose fingers touched the sky, he drove the he-goats and the rams outside to pasture. In the fold, the unmilked dams, their udders bursting, bleated. Although racked by pain, their master now felt out the backs of all the beasts that stood before him, but that fool did not suspect that all my men l lo were hid beneath the bellies of the rams. The last to leave the cave was my great ram, bearing the weight of his own fleece and me— with my thick plots. Huge Polyphemus probed and felt about his back. And then he asked: “ ‘Dear ram, why are you last to leave this cave? You never lagged behind the other sheep; you always were the very first to leave, always the first to hurry out to feed, to pasture on the tender grass, to leap 120 with long strides toward the riverside, to seek the fold with longing when the sun had set. But now you are the last to go. I’m sure that you are grieving for your master’s eye; a coward and his crew first dimmed my mind with their damned wine. That done, they left me blind. I don’t think death has caught that No-one yet. Would you could think and speak and tell me where he’s hiding from my fury! I would dash his brains across this cave: to smash him so 130 would free me from this No-one pest, these woes.’ “That said, he sent the ram out. When we’d gone a brief way past the cave and outer pens, I left the belly of the ram to set my comrades free. That done, we quickly drove the fat sheep with long shanks until we reached our ship; and we turned round again, again, to see if he was after us. And though our comrades welcomed our escape from death, they wept for those of us who now were lost. But I restrained their tears; my frown forbade such open grief. For now we had to speed— 140"},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"440 HOMER to board the many sheep with their rich fleece, then sail the salty sea. They rushed aboard; each rower manned his place along the thwarts, and then they struck the gray sea with their oars. But when we’d gone as far as shouting distance, I bellowed these sharp words to Polyphemus: “ ‘Cyclops, the men you snatched with brutal force and ate within your cave were surely not 150 the comrades of a coward. You have caused much grief; and it returns to haunt you now: you did not hesitate; hard heart, you ate your guests within your house; therefore lord Zeus has joined with other gods to batter you.’ “My words incensed him more. He ripped the top of a huge peak, then hurled a chunk at us; that mass fell just beyond our ship’s dark prow. The sea surged as the mass dropped; and the wash thrust our ship backward, closer to the coast. 160 But grabbing a long pole, I pushed us off and signaled with my head: I spurred my men to fall hard on the oars, to fend against shipwreck; and they rowed hard—they strained, they bent. When we were twice as distant as we’d been, I shouted to the Cyclops, though my men on all sides curbed me with these cautious words: “ ‘Why must you goad that savage so? Just now, the mass that monster cast into the sea drove back our ship to shore: we thought we’d reached 170 our end. And if he’d heard us breathe or speak even the slightest word, he would have hurled one more rough rock and smashed our heads and hull. That brute has force to spare: he can throw far.’ “These were their words. But my Arm heart was not convinced. Again my anger had to taunt: ‘Cyclops, if any mortal man should ask about the shameful blinding of your eye, then tell him that the man who gouged you was Odysseus, ravager of cities: one 180 who lives in Ithaca—Laertes’ son.’ “I spoke. As he replied, he groaned and sighed: ‘I hear again an ancient prophecy. An augur once lived here, a man most worthy, excelling all in seeing what would come, a seer grown old among us: Tdemus, great son of Eurymus. What he foretold"},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"ODYSSEY 441 is now fulfilled. He said that I would be a victim of Odysseus: he would blind me. But I was always watching out for one 190 handsome and grand, a formidable man; instead, one small and insignificant, a weakling, now has gouged my eye—he won his way by overcoming me with wine. But come, Odysseus, you’ll receive the gift I owe to you, my guest; and I’ll convince the great earth-shaker to escort your ship; I am his son—he says he is my father. He is the one to heal me, if he would: no other can—no blessed god, no man.’ 200 “These were his words. And I replied: ‘Would I might just as surely rob you of your life and breath and hurl you down to Hades’ house, as I am sure that even great Poseidon will never give you back the eye you lost.’ “These were my words. He prayed to lord Poseidon, lifting his hands up to the starry heaven: ‘Listen, Poseidon, dark-haired lord who clasps the earth hard fast, if I’m indeed your son and you declare yourself my father, then 210 don’t let this ravager of towns, Odysseus, Laertes’ son, who lives in Ithaca, return to his own land. But if his fate must have him see his dear ones once again and reach his sturdy home, his native land, then let him struggle back—a battered man, with all his comrades lost, and on a ship of strangers. In his house, let him meet grief’ “His prayer was done. The dark-haired god took heed. Again the Cyclops lifted up a stone, 220 even more staggering than the one he’d thrown before. He whirled it round; and when he hurled, fierce force was in that toss. The stone fell just behind our dark-prowed ship: it barely missed the steering oar. And as that rough rock fell, the sea surged high astern—but that wave helped: its thrust drove our ship toward the island’s shore. “There, on that isle, our other sturdy ships awaited us; our sighing shipmates sat, in fear. We beached our boat along the sands, 230 then disembarked. Out of the hollow hull we took the Cyclops’ flocks, dividing all"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"442 HOMER in equal shares: what each received was just. One sheep alone—my ram—was set apart; my well-greaved crew assigned that gift to me. Along the sands I sacrihced that ram to Cronos’ son, who gathers thunderclouds, Zeus, lord of all; for him I roasted thighs. But he did not accept that sacrifice: instead his mind was set—he meant to wreck 240 all of my sturdy ships and faithful friends. BOOK 10 [In telling his story to the Phaeacians, Odysseus makes clear that he—unlike his men— had learned from the Cyclops episode. Thus, he explains, when his small fleet approached the unknown land of the Laestrygonians to gather needed supplies, Odysseus took the precaution of anchoring his ship a safe distance from shore. Before learning anything about the local inhabitants’ treatment of strangers, however, Odysseus’s crewmen un- wisely moored their ships along the Laestrygonian shore;] “We’d reached the famous harbor. On two sides, l we saw the steep rock walls with their sheer rise; the narrow entranceway was flanked by two long juts of land. Within that curving cove, my comrades moored their shapely ships close by each other: there no wave is ever vexed, not surging or receding—a bright calm. “But I held back and moored outside. I tied my cable to a rock; my black ship stood beyond one headland’s edge. And then I climbed lO a rugged slope; I stood at that lookout; I saw no oxen’s furrows and no men— just puffs of smoke that rose up from the land. I chose two comrades and a third as herald, and then I sent those shipmates out to see what sort of men—bread eaters—held this land. They disembarked and took a well-tried way that wagons used for bringing wood to town down from the mountains. Just outside the town, they met a stalwart girl beside a spring: 20 she was the daughter of Antiphates the Laestrygonian. The spring where she was drawing limpid water was Artacia— a well that served the Laestrygonians. My men drew near; they asked what king ruled here and who were those he ruled. She pointed out her father’s high-roofed house. When they went in."},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"ODYSSEY 443 they found his wife; but she stood mountain-high, and they were horrified. At once she called for firm Antiphates; she brought him back from the assembly place. But all he planned was sad death for my men. He did not wait: he grabbed one of my crew and swallowed him; the other two were able to escape— they reached our ships. But now it was too late: the loud alarm had sounded; from all sides stout Laestrygonians, a countless crowd, rushed out—and they were not like men but Giants. The boulders that they hurled down from the cliffs were huge—the size a man could scarcely lift. The clamor from the ships was sinister, the sound of dying men and shattered decks; they speared my comrades, carried them like fish— an obscene meal. “While they were slaughtering my crews in the deep harbor, I drew out the sharp blade from beside my thigh: I cut the cables of my dark-prowed ship. I spurred my men to hurry to their oars: their heart and haste were needed to escape this trap; the fear of death pressed all to row as one. With luck I reached the open sea, far from the sheer cliffs. But the other ships were lost. “We sailed away—hearts sick and sad—set free at last, but with our dear companions dead. We reached Aeaea, isle of fair-haired Circe, the awesome goddess with a human voice, twin sister of the sinister Aeetes: they both were born of Hdios—who brought his light to men—and Perse, Ocean’s daughter. In silence we put in to shore; the harbor seemed safe; some gracious god had been our guide. We stayed two days, two nights—fatigued and tired. “But when, with fair-haired Dawn, the third day came, with spear and sharpened sword in hand I climbed up from the ship. I reached a rise from which I hoped to see the signs of human work and hear the sounds of men. And as I stood upon that lookout point, up from wide fields and through the forest and the underbrush, smoke rose: it came from Circe’s house. The sight of that black smoke inclined my heart and mind to seek the source. But as I thought again. 30 40 50 60 70"},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"444 HOMER another plan seemed best: I’d first go back to my swift ship along the shore, find food to feed my men, and then have them explore. “But when I had already neared my ship, some god took pity on my loneliness: across my path he sent a tall-horned stag. Down from his pasture in the forest, he— responding to the sun’s oppressive fury— 80 was heading to the riverbank to drink. When he had quit the stream, I struck his back; and right through his mid-spine, my bronze shaft passed. He moaned; he fell into the dust; his life took flight. I straddled him and tugged the shaft out from the wound, then left it on the ground and gathered lengths of brush and willow withes to weave a rope two arm’s-lengths long, twisted from end to end. I tied that huge beast’s feet and slung him round my neck, then, trudging, leaned 90 my weight upon the spear that I’d retrieved. That way I brought him back to the black ship: one hand across one shoulder never could have carried him—that stag was so immense. I threw him down in front of our lithe ship and gently urged my comrades, one by one: “ ‘O friends, however sad, let’s not descend to Hades’ hall before our destined day. No, just as long as there is food and drink in our swift ship, forget your fears of starving.’ lOO “These were my words. My men did not delay. They’d hid their heads with cloaks in their despair, but now they threw those wrappings off and stared: they saw the stag along the shore: indeed that beast was huge. And with their eyes appeased, they washed their hands and readied the fine feast. lOdysseus continues his narration: because of the Laestrygonians’ savage assault, the fleet that Odysseus commanded after leaving Troy was reduced to a single ship, which had put ashore on Circe s enchanted island. A powerful sorceress, Circe changed a group of Odysseus’s unwary men into swine. Forewarned by Hermes, Zeus’s Olympian mes- senger, Odysseus first threatened Circe with his sword, forcing her to return his men to human shape. He then became her lover, benefiting greatly from Circe’s extensive knowledge and wise advice:] “As soon as Dawn’s rose fingers touched the sky, I called my crew together, and I said:"},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"ODYSSEY 445 ‘Despite your long ordeal, do hear me out: my friends, we’ve lost all sense of where we are; 110 this island may lie east, it may lie west— where sun, which brings men light, sinks to its rest or where it’s born again. Let’s try at once to see if we can find some better course. I doubt it, for I climbed a rugged lookout: we’re on an island that is ringed about by endless seas; so crowned, the isle lies low, and at its center I saw curling smoke that rose up through the forest and thick brush.’ “My words were done. And their dear hearts were torn, 120 recalling the fierce Laestrygonian, Antiphates, and the man-eating Cyclops. Their groans were loud, their tears were many—yet nothing was gained by weeping. So I split my well-greaved men into two squads: each band had its own chief. I headed one; the second was led by the godlike Eurylochus. Within a casque of bronze we mixed our lots to see who would go off and spy the land. The choice fell on the firm Eurylochus. 130 And he went off with two-and-twenty men; both they who left and we who stayed then wept. “Within a forest glen, they found the home of Circe: it was built of polished stone and lay within a clearing. Round it roamed the mountain wolves and lions she’d bewitched with evil drugs. But they did not attack my men; they circled them; their long tails wagged. And just as dogs will fawn about their master when he returns from feasts—they know that he 140 will offer them choice bits—just so, did these lions and sharp-clawed wolves fawn on my men. And yet those tough beasts terrified my friends. They halted at the fair-haired Circe’s door; within they heard the goddess’ sweet voice sing as she moved back and forth before her web— imperishable, flawless, subtly-woven— such work as only goddesses can fashion. “Polites, sturdy captain, the most dear and trusted of my men, now told his friends: 150 ‘Someone inside is singing gracefully as she weaves her great web. And what she sings echoes throughout the house. Let’s call to her.’"},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":"446 HOMER “These were his words. They did what he had asked. She came at once. She opened her bright doors, inviting them within; and—fools—they followed. Eurylochus alone did not go in; he had foreseen some snare. She led the way and seated them on chairs and high-backed thrones. She mixed cheese, barley meal, and yellow honey 160 with wine from Pramnos; and she then combined malign drugs in that dish so they’d forget all thoughts of their own homes. When they had drunk, she struck them with her wand, then drove them off to pen them in her sties. They’d taken on the bodies—bristles, snouts—and grunts of hogs, yet kept the human minds they had before. So they were penned, in tears; and Circe cast before them acorns, dogwood berries, mast— food fit for swine who wallow on the ground. 170 “Meanwhile Eurylochus rushed back to us to let us know our comrades’ shameful fate. But he was speechless; though he longed for words, his heart was struck with pain, tears filled his eyes; nothing but lamentation filled his mind. But when we—baffled—questioned him, at last he told us what had happened to our friends: “ ‘Odysseus, we did follow your commands: we crossed the underbrush and reached the glen. We found a sheltered house with smooth stone walls. 180 And there, intent on her great web, a goddess or woman could be heard distinctly singing. My comrades called to her; she opened wide the gleaming doors, inviting them to enter. They, unsuspecting, trailed along. But I held back; I felt this was a trap. They dropped from sight together. Though I kept close watch— I waited long—no comrade reappeared.’ “These were his words. Across my back I cast my massive sword of bronze with silver studs, 190 and then I slung my bow; I ordered him to lead me back along the path he’d taken. But he, his arms about my knees, implored: “ ‘May you, whom Zeus has nurtured, leave me here; don’t force me to retrace my path. I know that you will not return and not bring back our men. With those we have let’s sail away, for we may still escape the evil day’"},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"ODYSSEY 447 “These were his words. I was compelled to say: ‘Eurylochus, you can stay here and eat 200 and drink beside the hollow black ship; I must go, however; I cannot forgo a task so necessary—this I owe.’ “That said, I left the sea and ship behind. But after I had crossed the sacred glades and was about to reach the halls of Circe, the connoisseur of potions, I saw Hermes, who bears the golden wand, approaching me. He’d taken on the likeness of a youth just come of age, blessed with a young man’s grace. 210 He clasped my hands. These were his words to me: “ ‘Where are you wandering still, unlucky man, alone along these slopes and ignorant of this strange land? Circe has locked your friends like swine behind the tight fence of her pens. And have you come to free them? On your own, be sure, you never will return; you’ll stay together with the others in her sties. But come. I’ll save you from her snares. I’ll thwart her plans. Now, when you enter Circe’s halls, 220 don’t leave behind this tutelary herb. I’ll tell you all her fatal stratagems: She’ll mix a potion for you; she’ll add drugs into that drink; but even with their force, she can’t bewitch you; for the noble herb I’ll give you now will baffle all her plots. When Circe touches you with her long wand, draw out the sharp sword at your thigh, and head for her as if you meant to strike her dead. Shrinking, she’ll ask you then to share her bed. 230 And do not, then or later, turn her down, for she will free your friends and be of help to you, her guest. But first force her to swear the blessed gods’ great, massive oath: She must forgo all thought of any other plots— when you are stripped and naked, she must not deceive you, leave you feeble, impotent.’ “When that was said, he gave his herb to me; he plucked it from the ground and showed what sort of plant it was. Its root was black; its flower 240 was white as milk. It’s moly for the gods; for mortal men, the mandrake—very hard to pluck; but nothing holds against the gods."},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":"448 HOMER “Then Hermes crossed the wooded isle and left for steep Olympus. And I took the path to Circe’s house—most anxious as I went. I stopped before the fair-haired goddess’ door; I halted, called aloud; she heard my voice. At once she opened her bright doors and then invited me to follow her. I went 250 with troubled heart. She led me to a chair, robust and handsome, graced with silver studs; a footrest stood below. And she poured out an ample drink into a golden bowl. With her conniving mind, she mixed her drugs within that bowl, then offered it to me. I drank it down. But I was not bewitched. She struck me with her long wand. Then she said: ‘Now to the sty, to wallow with your friends!’ “At that, out from its sheath along my thigh, 260 I drew my sword as if to have her die. She howled. She clasped my knees and, as she wept, with these winged words, made her appeal to me: “ ‘Who are you? From what family? What city? You drank my drugs, but you were not entranced. No other man has ever passed that test; for once that potion’s passed their teeth, the rest have fallen prey: you have within your chest a heart that can defeat my sorcery. You surely are the man of many wiles, 270 Odysseus, he whom I was warned against by Hermes of the golden wand: he said that you would come from Troy in a black ship. But now put back your blade within that sheath and let us lie together on my bed: in loving, we’ll learn trust and confidence.’ “These were her words. And this was my reply: ‘Circe, how can you ask for tenderness, you who have turned my comrades into swine and now, insidiously, try to bind 280 me, too—for once I’m naked on your bed, you’ll snare me, leave me weak and impotent? I will not share your bed unless you swear the mighty oath, o goddess—to insure that you’ll forgo all thoughts of further plots.’ “These were my words. As I had asked, she swore at once. And after that great oath was pledged, I then climbed onto Circe’s lovely bed."},{"pageNumber":477,"pageContent":"ODYSSEY 449 “Meanwhile four girls were busy in the halls; these maids were once dear daughters of the woods 290 and springs and seaward-flowing sacred streams. Across the high-backed chairs, one handmaid first draped linen cloth and then threw purple rugs. The second drew up silver tables set with golden baskets, while the third maid mixed smooth honeyed wine in silver bowls and brought fair golden cups. The fourth maid filled a tripod with water and, beneath it, lit a fire; and when it bubbled in the glowing bronze caldron, she set me down inside a tub. 300 Over my head and shoulders she poured water— gradually tempering its heat— to free my limbs and soul from long fatigue. And when that maid had bathed and, with rich oil, had smoothed my body and about me cast a tunic and a handsome cloak, she led the way and sat me on a high-backed chair, robust and handsome, graced with silver studs; a footrest stood below. A servant brought a lovely golden jug from which she poured 310 fresh water out into a silver bowl, so I might wash my hands; then at my side she placed a polished table. The old housewife was generous; she drew on lavish stores, inviting me to eat. But I was not inclined to feed my frame: I sat and thought of other things; my soul foresaw the worst. Circe, who saw me seated there denying all food and filled with dark despair, drew near. And, at my side, she called on these winged words: 320 “ ‘Odysseus, do not sit there like some mute, with tattered heart, not touching drink or food. Do you suspect another trap? Forget your fears. I swore the strongest oath there is.’ “These were her words. And this was my reply: ‘Circe, what man with justice in his mind would think of food and drink before he freed his comrades and could see them with his eyes? If you indeed would have me drink and eat, release my men: bring back my faithful friends.’ 330 “These were my words. And Circe—wand in hand— now left the hall and, opening the pens, drove out my men; they had the shape of fat nine-year-old hogs. They faced her. She drew close."},{"pageNumber":478,"pageContent":"450 HOMER Upon the flesh of each of them, she spread another herb.

Their cries of joy were long and loud; throughout the house a clamor rose. And Circe, too, was moved. Then she—the lovely goddess—urged: “ ‘Odysseus, man of many wiles, divine son of Laertes, go to your swift ship along the shore and beach it on dry land. First store your goods and all your gear in caves, but then return with all your faithful friends.’ “These were her words. My proud soul was convinced: 350 I hurried to the shore and my swift ship. And there I found my faithful crew in tears. Even as calves upon a farm are glad when cows return from pasture, having had their fill of grass, and come back to their stalls; and all the calves frisk round unchecked; no pen can hold them as they race around their dams, lowing again, again—so did my men, when they caught sight of me, weep tears of joy: they felt as if they’d touched their native land, 360 their rugged Ithaca, where they were bred and born. In tears, they uttered these winged words: “ ‘You, whom Zeus nurtured, have come back; for us this joy is like the joy that would erupt on our return to Ithaca, our home.

Then, all of you be quick to follow me; 370 in Circe’s sacred halls you soon will see your comrades eating, drinking; they can count on never-ending stores.’ “My words were done.

I had a mind to draw the sharp blade sheathed beside my sturdy thigh. I’d have sliced off his head and flung it down upon the ground—although Eurylochus was kin of mine by marriage. But my men drew near and checked me with these gentle words: “ ‘If you—one sprung from Zeus—prefer it so, he can stay here and watch the ship. We’ll go 390 with you: lead us to Circe’s sacred house.’ “That said, they left the ship and shore behind. Eurylochus came, too. He did not stay: my rage was ominous—he was afraid. “Meanwhile, with kindness, Circe, in her halls, cared for my other men: she bathed them all, and then she smoothed their skins with gleaming oil and wrapped them in flne tunics and soft cloaks. We found them feasting on abundant stores. But when they all had recognized each other, 400 their tears and wails were loud throughout the halls. Bright Circe, standing at my side, advised: “ ‘Odysseus, man of many wiles, divine son of Eaertes, do not urge more tears.

But eat this food and drink this wine—and find the force you had when you first left behind your homeland, rugged Ithaca. Your minds 4i0 can only think of bitter wanderings; you’re worn and weary, without joy or ease; you’ve lived too long—too much—with grinding griefs.’ “These were her words. And our proud hearts agreed. Day after day we stayed for one whole year: we ate much meat; the wine was honey-sweet. “But when the months that fill a year had passed, and seasons had revolved, and once again the long days reached their end, my comrades said:"},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"452 HOMER “ ‘Wake from your trance, remember your own land, 420 if fate is yet to save you, if you can still reach your high-walled house, your native isle.’ “These were their words.

But once the sun had gone and darkness won, within the shadowed halls, my comrades slept. “And I went off to Circe’s splendid bed. I clasped her knees. She heard as I beseeched: ‘Circe, fulfill the promise made to me: 430 do let me leave for home. My men entreat, and my own heart wants that. Whenever you are out of hearing, all my men implore again, again: they long to leave these shores.’ “The lovely goddess gave this quick reply: ‘Odysseus, man of many wiles, divine son of Laertes, do not spend more time within my house if you will otherwise. But you cannot reach home till you complete another journey—to the house of Hades 440 and fierce Persephone. There you must seek the soul of that blind seer, Tiresias the Theban: he alone among the dead preserves his wits and sober sense: this gift Persephone has granted just to him, for all the other dead are wandering shades.’ “My heart was broken as I heard her words. Seated upon that bed, I cried: my soul had lost its will to live, to see the light. But when my need to weep and writhe was done, 450 these were the words with which I answered her: “ ‘Circe, who’ll serve as pilot on that way?

Then, when he heard the noise of our departure, he jumped up suddenly, and so—forgetting the long way down by ladder—off the roof headfirst he fell. And from his spine, his neck was broken off; his spirit went to Hades. “But I, to those who followed me, now said: ‘Though you may think that you are going home, back to your own dear land, another road is ours, for Circe said we first must see the halls of Hades and Persephone; there we must meet Tiresias of Thebes.’ “My words broke their dear hearts. They sat and wept; they tore their hair; but all of that lament gained nothing for us. Still in tears, we went back to the shore; alongside our black ship, 530 Circe had tied a ram and jet black ewe, but none of us had seen her go or come; she passed us by so easily. How can a man detect a god who comes and goes if gods refuse to have their movements known?” BOOK 11 [Odysseus’s account to the Phaeacians continues: following Circe’s directions, Odys- seus sailed northwestward across the River of Ocean to the dim entrance of Hades’ realm. After Odysseus performed ritual animal sacrifices evoking the forces of the Un- derworld, shadowy forms began to appear to drink the blood that temporarily revived them enough to communicate with the living. The first to speak was Elpenor, who re- quested that his body be properly buried.] “And after I’d implored with vows and prayers i the tribes of those dead souls, I seized the sheep and slit their throats above the pit; cloud-dark blood ran. From £rebus there came a crowd of dead souls: girls, young bachelors, and old men much tried by grief, and tender brides still new to sorrow. Many fighting-men came, too; they’d died in battle, pierced by bronze-tipped spears; and they still wore their bloodstained battle gear. These crowded round the pit upon all sides; 510 520 10"},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"ODYSSEY 455 they uttered strange outcries. I paled with fear. At that, I spurred my men to flay and roast the sheep we’d sacrificed, whose throats I’d cut with ruthless bronze; and we prayed to the gods, to Hades’ force and fierce Persephone. With my sharp sword again unsheathed, I watched over the pit of sacrificial blood, lest any of the fragile dead draw near that blood before I met Tiresias. “The first dead soul to come was young Elpenor, my comrade; one who’d yet to find a grave beneath the earth’s wide ways; we’d left his corpse unwept, unburied, there in Circe’s house; we had another task—and hurried off. The sight of him provoked my tears and pity; and when I spoke to him, my words were winged: ‘Elpenor, you on foot were faster than my ship. How did you reach this shadowed land?’ “These were my words; this was his sad reply: ‘Odysseus, man of many wiles, divine son of Laertes, my undoing lay in some god sending down my dismal fate and in too much sweet wine. I lay stretched out on Circe’s roof; too stupefied to think of taking the long ladder down, I fell headfirst, down to the ground. My neck was cracked, split from my spine; my spirit went to Hades. Now I beseech you in the name of those you left behind, the absent ones: your wife and he who reared you when you were a child, your father, and Telemachus, the son you left alone at home. I know that you, on leaving Hades’ halls, will find landfall with your stout ship at the Aegean isle. There, lord, I ask you to remember me. Do not abandon me, unwept, unburied, lest you provoke the anger of the gods. Burn me and any armor that is mine, and on the shore of the gray sea, heap high a mound for this unhappy man. Do this for me, and set upon that mound the oar I used when I, alive, rowed with my friends.’ “And then the shade of my dead mother came: she, Anticleia, child of generous Autolycus, had been alive when I had left for holy flion.

But I was not allowed to sate my eyes, to see my own beloved son: my wife denied that sight to me—she killed me first. And I should add this warning: Don’t forget to moor in secret when you bring your ship 300 to your dear shores: no woman merits trust.

Even in his wrath, he might have spoken to me then, or I to him.

But when Charybdis gulped the salty sea, one saw her at the whirlpool’s base, in frenzy; her cliff roared terrifyingly; beneath the sea, the earth’s black sand lay bare; pale fear held fast my crew; we feared the end and glued our eyes upon Charybdis.

But I heard no reply. They cast sleep on my eyes. “Meanwhile Eurylochus provoked my men, and what he offered was a fatal plan: ‘Friends, though your trials are harsh, hear what I say. All deaths are dour; the fate of men is sad; but there’s no death more miserable than the doom starvation sends. Come, let us take 140 Fiyperion’s best cows and sacrifice to the undying gods, who rule the skies. If we reach Ithaca, our fathers’ land, there we—at once—shall build for Helios an altar heaped with many glowing gifts. And if our taking of his tall-horned cows enrages Helios, and he would wreck our ship and has the other gods’ consent. I’d rather have my mouth drink brine and let the waves kill me at once than meet slow death 1 5 0 by lingering on an island wilderness.’ “So did he speak, and all the rest agreed. At once they chose the sun-god’s finest cattle: just then, those broad-browed cows with curving horns were grazing near the dark-prowed ship; my men surrounded them and prayed unto the gods; since we, on board our ship, had no white barley, they plucked the green leaves of a tall oak tree— over their offering, they’d scatter these. After they’d prayed and cut the throats and flayed 160 the cows, they sliced the thighs in chunks and laid a double layer of fat across those chunks, then spread raw flesh on top. They had no wine to splash across the blazing sacrifice"},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"470 HOMER but, using water for libations, roasted ail of the vitals on the fire. And when the thighs were scorched and they had tasted all the inner parts, they set the rest on spits. “But now sweet sleep had left my eyes, and I walked back to the swift ship at the seaside; 170 and when my steps drew close to our trim craft, I smelled the pungent fragrance of hot fat. I groaned, then called upon the deathless gods: “ ‘You, father Zeus, and all the other blessed, undying gods, you sent this wretchedness; it’s you who left me prey to senseless sleep; you gulled me; I am ruined; now my men, awaiting me, contrived this horrid plan.’ “Meanwhile Lampetie, the long-robed nymph, had hurried off to tell lord Helios 180 that we had killed his cows. Without delay, before his fellow gods, he cried, enraged: “ ‘You, father Zeus, and all the other blessed and deathless gods—you now must take revenge: destroy the comrades of Laertes’ son, Odysseus; in their insolence they killed the herds that I beheld with such delight both when I climbed the starry sky and when I wheeled and then returned to earth again. If they’re not made to pay a penalty 190 to match their sin, I shall descend to Hades and shine among the dead.’ “In turn, Zeus said: ‘Shine, Helios, with light for the immortals; and lighten, too, the lives of those who die on earth, the giver of the gift of grain. As for those sinners. I’ll soon strike their ship with blazing lightning—tearing her to bits upon the winedark sea.’ “I heard all this from the fair-haired Calypso after she had heard it from the messenger Hermes. 200 “I reached the ship and shore and—one by one— denounced my men. But nothing could be done— the herds lay dead. And soon the gods sent portents: the flayed hides crawled along the ground; the flesh"},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"ODYSSEY 471 upon the spits, both roast and raw, began to bellow; we heard sounds of lowing cows. “My faithful comrades feasted for six days upon the finest beasts of Helios. But when Zeus, son of Cronos, brought to us the seventh day, no longer fury-fed, 210 the wind died down. We boarded quickly, stepped our mast and spread our sail, then drove ahead— out toward the open sea. “When we had left that isle behind and saw no other land, only the sky and sea, the son of Cronos set a black cloud above our hollow ship; below us waves grew dark. By now our run was doomed; the howling Zephyr fell upon our course; a wind amok, its fury cracked the forestays of the mast. The mast fell back; 220 the sail and all the rigging crashed, collapsed into the bilge. And at the stern, the mast hit hard the helmsman’s head; it crushed his skull; and like a diver, from the deck he plunged headlong; his sturdy spirit left his bones. Zeus thundered as he hurled a lightning bolt. He hit the hull: it filled with sulfurous smoke; our ship whirled round full circle. AJl my men pitched overboard; like sea crows they were borne by waves around our black-bowed craft. A god 230 deprived them of the day of their return. “I paced the ship until a comber ripped the keel and hull apart. The naked keel was carried by the surge, which also snapped the mast off from the hulk—but it still had a backstay made of oxhide. This I grabbed. That rope in hand, I lashed the keel and mast together; hugging them, I then was driven by the malicious winds. And after Zephyr had slacked his storm’s wild force, Notus at once 240 brought back the fear that I had known; for now I’d have to cross Charybdis once again. “All through the night that wind did not relent. The sun was rising when I spied the cliffs of Scylla and the murderous Charybdis, who sucked in the salt waters of the sea; she drew my mast and keel into her deeps."},{"pageNumber":500,"pageContent":"472 HOMER But reaching up and toward the great fig tree, I gripped it, clinging to it like a bat. Yet I could find no foothold, could not climb 250 that tree, because its roots stretched far below; nor could I ever reach its long, broad boughs— so high, they wrapped Charybdis in their shade. I gripped that trunk; I would not yield until she vomited again the mast and keel. I waited long; at last they came. Just when an elder who is called upon to judge between the claims of young contenders, stands and says the time for judgment’s at an end and leaves the marketplace to dine, so then— 260 such was the hour—Charybdis spewed the mast and keel. My hands and feet let go the trunk; I fell into the water with a splash next to the keel and mast; I mounted them; and, with that vantage, soon my arms began to row. The father of both gods and men did not let Scylla’s eyes spy me again. “For nine days I was dragged; and on the tenth the gods cast me upon Ogygia’s coast, the island home of lovely-haired Calypso, 270 the awesome goddess with a human voice, who took me in and tended me. But why do I retell this now? Just yesterday, within this hall, I told that tale to you and to your noble wife. I do not hold with telling over what has been well told.” BOOKS 13-23 lAfter the Phaeacians transport him safely home to Ithaca, Odysseus, with Athene’s help, disguises himself as a wandering beggar. Having revealed his identity only to Telema- chus and his faithful swineherd Eumaeus, Odysseus covertly plots his revenge on the suitors. Athene inspires Penelope to propose that she will marry the man who can string her lost husband’s great bow and shoot an arrow through twelve ax heads, a feat that only the most worthy hero can accomplish. After stringing the bow, Odysseus and his few supporters exact vengeance on the suitors, slaughtering every one in the great hall. Wondering at this unexpected turn of events, Penelope is called to meet her husband for the first time in twenty years. From Book 23:l Then Euryclela answered: “My dear child, l how can the barrier of your teeth permit such speech to cross your lips? Fdow can you say that your Odysseus never will return"},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"ODYSSEY 473 when he is in this house, at his own hearth? You’ve always had an unbelieving heart. But there’s another certain sign that I must share with you: the wound that long ago the white-tusked boar inflicted on Odysseus. I saw this when I washed his feet; I should have told you this, but it was he himself who laid his hand upon my mouth; he would not let me speak—yes, he is keen, astute. But follow me; I stake my life—if I have tricked you, I am forfeit, I must die.” Then wise Penelope replied: “Dear nurse, however wise one is, it still is hard to read the counsels of the deathless gods. But let us hurry to my son, that I may see the slaughtered and their slaughterer.” That said, she left: behind her upper rooms. Her heart was still unsure: Was she to probe her husband from afar or, drawing close, to kiss his head and hands? She crossed the sill of stone and took a seat within the hall, facing Odysseus as he sat beside the far wall in the firelight. His eyes cast down, he leaned against a pillar, waiting to see if, when she saw him there, his wife would speak to him. But she sat long in silence, her heart assailed by wonder; now her eyes stared full upon his face, and once again she failed to recognize him—he was dressed so miserably. But Telemachus rebuked her: “Mother, you are hard of heart: why do you stay so far away from my dear father? Were you at his side, you might ask question after question. Yes, your heart is stubborn—surely there’s no other woman who’d keep her distance from her own dear husband who, after he has suffered many trials in more than nineteen years away, returns to her, in her dear land. Not even stone is harder than the hardness your heart shows.” This was the wise Penelope’s reply: “My son, the soul within my breast is struck with wonder; I’ve no words; I cannot ask; I cannot even look him in the face. 10 20 30 40"},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"474 HOMER If what I see in truth is my Odysseus come home to me, we two shall certainly know one another without questioning; we’ve secret signs, unknown to all but us.” That said, the patient, bright Odysseus smiled. He turned to his dear son with these winged words: “Telemachus, be patient: let your mother test me within these halls; she soon will find the way in which I can be recognized. Now, since I’m dressed in tattered rags and filth, she scorns me—won’t admit that I am he. Meanwhile the two of us can make our plans. Even if a slain man has left few friends who’d seek revenge, the killer flees that land— he’s exiled from his city and his clan. But we have killed the pillars of this town, the noblest youths of Ithaca: I ask that you reflect most carefully on that.” Telemachus’ reply was keen and wise: “Dear father, you yourself can see to this. They say that you’re the most astute of men— no mortal can contrive more cunning plans. We three will follow where you choose to lead; whatever strength we have is yours to spend.” Odysseus, man of many wiles, replied: “Then I shall tell you what seems best to me. Once you have bathed yourselves. I’d have you dress in tunics; let the women wear their best. The godly singer is to take his harp and lead us in a glad and varied dance, so those who live nearby or those who chance to pass along the road will say that we are in the middle of a wedding feast. Then rumors will not spread throughout the town: no one will hear about the suitors’ deaths until we’ve left for our well-wooded farm. Once we are there, we can devise a scheme— whatever plan Olympus will concede.” His words were done. They heard, and they obeyed. They bathed, and then they dressed; in fine array the women gathered; and the godly singer took up his hollow harp and spurred them on: they longed for seemly dance and gracious song. Out from the great house echoed loud the tread 50 60 70 80 90"},{"pageNumber":503,"pageContent":"ODYSSEY 475 of men who danced and women finely dressed. And those who heard those sounds outside now said: “Someone has surely wed the queen at last— the woman whom they wanted so. That bitch no longer guards the great house of her own true husband, waiting—firm — for his return.” So some did say, but none knew what had passed. Meanwhile Eurynome, the housewife, bathed lOO in his own halls the resolute Odysseus, then smoothed his body down with oil and cast a tunic round his back. That done, Athena, the gray-eyed goddess, made him more robust and taller, and she gave him thicker hair, which flowed down from his head in curls and clusters that seemed much like the hyacinth in flower. Just as a craftsman who has learned his secrets from both the gray-eyed goddess and Hephaestus frames silver with fine gold and thus creates no a work with greater plenitude and grace, so did the goddess now enhance the face and head and shoulders of Odysseus. When he came from the bath and reached the hall, his form was like the form of the immortals. Again he took the chair from which he’d risen, facing his wife. He said: “Perplexing woman! To you the gods who hold Olympus gave a heart more obdurate than any they have ever given other—weaker—women. 120 What other woman has a heart so stubborn as to deny herself her own dear husband, who’s suffered trial on trial and, after more than nineteen years, returns to his own shores! Come, nurse, I need to rest; prepare a couch, that I, though all alone, may lay me down: within her breast she has a heart of iron,” This was the wise Penelope’s reply: “Wild man! I am not proud, I do not taunt, nor am I stupefied — I know full well 130 how you appeared when, in your long-oared ship, you left your Ithaca, Yes, Eurycleia, prepare the sturdy bedstead for him now outside the solid bridal room that he himself constructed; carry out the bed, and over it throw cloaks, bright blankets, fleece.”"},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":"476 HOMER These words of hers were meant to test Odysseus. Incensed, her husband cried to his keen wife; “Woman, your words have wounded me. Who tore my bedstead from its base? For it would take 140 a god—if he so pleased—to shift its place. No man alive, however young and strong, with mortal force alone could hope to budge that bed without great strain, for it contains a secret in its making. No one else contrived that bed: I fashioned it myself. Within our court a long-leaved olive trunk stood stout and vigorous, just like a pillar. Around that trunk I built our bridal room. I finished it with close-set stones and laid 150 a sturdy roof above; I added doors that fitted faultlessly. Then I lopped off the olive’s long-leaved limbs; and so I thinned the trunk, up from its base; with my bronze adze, I smoothed it down with craft and care; I made that wood run true and straight, and it became my bedpost. Once I’d bored it with an auger, I, starting with that part, began to shape my frame and, with that job well done, inlaid my work with silver, ivory, and gold. 160 Inside the frame I stretched taut oxhide thongs; their crimson shone. My secret sign is told. Woman, I do not know if my bed stands where it once stood or if by now some man has sawed the bedstead from the trunk and set my bed elsewhere.” These were his words; her knees and heart went weak; the secret signs that he revealed were certain proof She ran to greet Odysseus, threw her arms around his neck, and kissed his head and said: “Dear heart, don’t rage: 170 Odysseus, let the wisdom you’ve displayed in all else show here now. It is the gods who destined us to sorrow; they begrudged our staying side by side—the two of us— enjoying youth and coming to the start of our old age together.

Even Argive Helen, Zeus’ daughter, never would have lain in love beside a stranger had she known that sons of the Achseans were to wage a war to bring her back again to her own land.

Actor’s child, the girl my father had given me when I first journeyed here to Ithaca—the maid who kept the doors of our stout bridal chamber; and with this, my heart, which was so stubborn, is convinced.” These were her words; they spurred his need to cry; in tears Odysseus clasped his dear, wise wife. 200 And as the sight of land is welcomed by the only shipwrecked sailors to survive when whiplash winds and crashing combers sent by lord Poseidon have destroyed their ship; in flight from the gray sea, they swim toward shore, their bodies caked with brine, and now at last set foot upon the beach; their grief is past: so at the sight of him, there was delight in her; she twined her white arms round his neck. And Dawn with her rose fingers would have found 2io those two still tearful had the gray-eyed goddess, Athena, not devised this stratagem: She slowed the night, delayed its journey’s end; and then she held back Dawn, whose throne is gold; she did not let her yoke the racing foals that carry light to men — the colts of Dawn, Lampus and Phaethon. Odysseus said: “Dear wife, we’ve not yet reached the end of all our toils; in days to come. I’ll face a test so long and hard—so measureless—and yet 220 there is no part of it I can neglect. So did the spirit of Tiresias foresee; of this he told me on that day when I went down to Hades’ house to ask about my comrades’ and my journey back.

But since you called to mind that trial—it is some god who made you think of that—speak out: I’ll have to hear of it at some time soon, and now is just as good a time as then.” Odysseus, man of many wiles, replied: “Strange woman! Why do you incite me so to speak? And yet I’ll tell you all I know without disguise, though there is no delight for you—and none for me—in hearing this 240 just as I heard it from Tiresias. He said that I, with shapely oar in hand, must visit many cities till I reach a land where men know nothing of the sea and don’t use salt to season what they eat; they’re ignorant of boats with purple cheeks and shapely oars that are the wings of ships. He told me this clear sign, which I won’t keep from you: When on the road a man meets me and says that what I’m carrying must be 250 a fan for winnowing, I can be sure: that is the place where I must plant my oar and offer lord Poseidon handsome gifts— a ram, a bull, a boar that mates with sows. Then, once I have returned to Ithaca, I am to offer holy hecatombs to the undying gods, wide heaven’s lords— to each in turn. I shall not die at sea: the death that reaches me will be serene. I shall grow old—a man of wealth and ease— 260 surrounded by a people rich, at peace. All this, he said, will surely come to be.” The wise Penelope had this to say: “Yet if the gods, at least in your old age, allow you better days, you may escape at last from trials and wars. So we can hope.” Such were the things they shared with one another. Meanwhile, by bright torchlight, old Eurycleia had joined Eurynome, and both were busy wrapping the sturdy bedstead in soft blankets. 270 The old nurse then went back to her own room. Eurynome, the keeper of their chamber, led them across the court by firelight"},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"ODYSSEY 479 and then went back again. And he and she delighted in the sight of their old couch, Telemachus, the cowherd, and the swineherd meanwhile had stayed their feet; they danced no more; and once they’d stopped the women, they themselves lay down to sleep within the shadowed halls. But when Odysseus and Penelope 280 had had their fill of love’s delights, the joys of talk were theirs, the telling one another of all their trials. She told him of her grief as she—fair woman—watched the vicious suitors, that crowd who, in their wooing her, had butchered so many beasts—both cattle and plump sheep— as well as drawing wine beyond all measure. Odysseus, born of Zeus, in turn rehearsed the sorrows he’d inflicted and endured; he spared her nothing. His dear wife felt deep 290 delight in listening, and no sweet sleep touched her until his telling was complete. His story started with his victory against the Cicones, and how he reached the fertile land of men who feed on lotus. He touched on all the malice of the Cyclops, and how he’d made that monster pay his due for having mercilessly eaten some of his stout crew. King Aeolus came next, the lord who welcomed him, then sent him off, 300 though fate denied him passage to his home: a storm wind snatched him up, thrust him across the fish-rich sea as he groaned heavily. And then his tale took in Telepylus, the city of the Laestrygonians, who wrecked his ship and killed his well-greaved men. He also told of Circe’s wiles and craft and how, upon a ship with many oars, he came to Hades’ somber house to meet the spirit of Tiresias of Thebes; 310 there he saw all his comrades and his mother, she who had borne and reared him. Then he told how he had heard the never-ending song the Sirens sing; and how he reached the rocks they call the Wanderers, and grim Charybdis, and Scylla, she from whom no man has yet escaped intact; and how his comrades killed the herds of Helios—and Zeus, the lord of thunder, struck his swift ship with a bolt"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"480 HOMER of smoking lightning; all his comrades died, 320 and he alone escaped death s heartless Fates. His coming to Calypso’s isle, Ogygia, was next: that nymph had kept him in her caves; she wanted him as husband; tending him, she thought to make him deathless, ever young; but she could not convince the heart within his breast. So after many trials, he came to the Phaeacians, who, most eagerly, paid him the honors men bestow on gods and, after they had given him much gold 330 and bronze and many clothes, escorted him back to his own dear land on their swift ship. This was the end of what he had to tell; now sleep assaulted him, sweet sleep that can loosen the limbs and soothe the griefs of men. [Odysseus is successfully reunited with Penelope and resumes his role as husband, fa- ther, and master of his household, but he has yet to reestablish his role as king. Ancient laws of blood vengeance demand that relatives of the slain suitors uphold their families’ honor by killing the young men’s slayer. In Book 24, Odysseus, his aged father Laertes, his son Telemachus, and a few loyal retainers prepare to fight the suitors’ angry kins- men, threatening to plunge Ithaca into anarchy. At this point, Athene intervenes with Zeus, who promises to make the suitors’ relatives forget their grievances and conclude a pact to accept Odysseus as their permanent king.

Whereas tragedy emphasizes Dionysus’s frightening mutability — n ature’s irresistible law of change that sparks unexpected reversals in human fortune—comedy celebrates the beneficent life force he embodies. The great Athenian play- wrights reworked ancient myths illustrating Dionysian motifs of suffering, sacrifice, rebirth, and reintegration. In the Bacchae, Euripides dramatizes the tragic myth recounting Dionysus’s return to his home city of Thebes and the terrible vengeance that the god exacts on those who reject him. The Theate r o Co reek myth makes its primary impact to- day in two major literary forms: the narrative poetry of Homer and Hesiod, which dates from the mid-eighth century B.C., and the dramatic poetry of Athenian play- wrights who wrote almost three hundred years later. The nearly three centuries sepa- rating Homeric epic from the oldest surviving Greek play, the Persians of Aeschylus (c. 472 B.C.), witnessed enormous changes in Greek society. In 508 B.C., Athens instituted the world’s first democratic constitution, only to have this nascent democ- racy threatened by two successive waves of invading Persian armies—successfully re- pelled at the crucial battles of Marathon (490 B.C.) and Salamis (480 B.C.)— i n both of which Aeschylus, dramatist and citizen-soldier, participated (Figure 13-1). Some of these social and political developments, including the establishment of a jury system, are reflected in the Athenian drama’s creative transformation of mytho- logical themes to fit a newly democratic society.

AS this time line indicates, Greece went through a rapid period of development in the centuries immediately following the Dark Ages. Increased trade and exchange of ideas with older civilizations of the Near East brought both economic and intellectual growth as Greek city-states evolved an art and way of life that eventually gave birth to the cultural flowering of the fifth century B.C. The leading city-states, Athens and Sparta, united to repel two major invasions from Persia (the Persian Wars, 490 and 480- 479 B.C.), after which victories Athens, by then the world’s first democracy, pursued a policy of cultural and military imperialism. Threatened by Athenian expansion, Sparta engaged Ath- ens in a series of devastating conflicts (the Peloponnesian War, 431-404 B.C.), which resulted in Athens’s collapse and Sparta’s exhaustion. Except for the comedies of Aristophanes, all sur- viving Greek plays were written between the end of the Persian Wars and the deaths of Soph- ocles and Euripides, just two years before Athens’s surrender to Sparta in 404 B.C. Euripides—the ancient traditions were creatively reworked and applied to the social and political issues confronted by Athens’s democratic institutions. Many of the sur- viving tragedies show how myth was used to highlight problems facing a democracy, particularly the crucial interaction of powerful leaders with the people as a whole. In play after play, mythical heroes and heroines act out conflicts that divide the com- munity and threaten its political stability; in many cases, the dramas emphasize the disastrous consequences to the state when rulers unilaterally refuse to heed popular opinion or effect a compromise between opposing points of view. The heroine of Sophocles’ Antigone, for example, openly disobeys a law that she considers both un- just and contrary to custom and family duty. Creon, Antigone’s uncle and ruler of Thebes, is equally inflexible, insisting that he alone has the right to make and enforce the city’s laws. As the chorus observes, both Creon and Antigone express valid prin- ciples—he about the necessity of submitting to lawful order and she about a higher obligation toward blood kin—but their absolute refusal to work out a compromise not only destroys both but also plunges the state into chaos (see Chapter 16 )."},{"pageNumber":515,"pageContent":"The Theater of Dionysus and the Tragic Vision 487 The difficulties involved when two unyielding opponents are both right—at least from their individual perspectives—generate dramatic conflict in most of the plays anthologized in this book. Even Zeus, whom the author of Prometheus Bound as arbitrary and unjust at the beginning of his reign, manifests the perils of rigidity that result from administrative inexperience. New to power, he presumes to rule the universe without compassion or real wisdom, qualities that, paradoxically, he must acquire from Prometheus if his government is to survive. Euripides’ Bacchae presents a similarly arbitrary ruler, a young king who denies the value of Dionysian freedom, rejecting all advice, including the wise counsel of Tiresias, Apollo’s prophet. At the climax of his Oresteia, three plays about the ruling house of Mycenae, Aeschylus dramatizes the establishment in Athens of a basic democratic institution, a court of law empowered to punish or pardon offenders. So important is this development in the evolution of civilization that the playwright shows Olympians descending from heaven to legitimize the legal system, with Athene representing the will of Zeus as she achieves a compromise between the ancient practice of blood vengeance and the introduction of democratic justice. The City Dionysid and the Birth of Drama Whereas the gods and heroes of Homer and Hesiod belonged to all Greece, helping to define the Greek people’s collective identity, it was principally in Athens that an- cient myths were recast in an entirely new art form—dramatic performances in the theater of Dionysus. Although both tragedy and comedy began in rituals honoring Dionysus, their exact origin and earliest development are unknown. In his Poetics, Aristotle (384-322 B.C.) briefly remarks that tragedy “originated with the authors of the dithyramb” and “advanced by slow degrees” until “it found its natural form, and there it stopped.” The dithyramb, an ecstatic choral song celebrating the wine god’s prowess, was an integral part of an important Athenian festival dedicated to Diony- sus’s worship, the City (or Great) Dionysia, reputedly established by the Athenian leader Pisistratus about 535-533 B.C. Although the City Dionysia regularly featured a dithyrambic contest among Ath- ens’s ten tribes, each of which had a chorus of fifty men and another of fifty boys dancing and singing a Dionysian hymn, only one example of the dithyramb has survived—the opening choral ode of Euripides’ Bacchae (see pp. 510-562). Held annually in early March, the City Dionysia began with a noisy procession of citizens carrying emblems of the god’s cult, including grotesque masks (representing his di- verse manifestations), sacred phalluses, and an effigy of the mutilated and dismem- bered Dionysus (see Chapter 8). Celebrating the making of new wine (Figure 13-2), many participants generously sampled Dionysus’s liquid gift, happily exploring the potentialities of intoxication. Raucous merrymaking combined with solemn ritual as celebrants offered sacrifices to the volatile deity who embodied life’s irregular cycles of joy, grief, death, and rebirth. A priest of Dionysus presided over the entire five-day affair, occupying a prominent seat of honor in the front row of the theater. When Pisistratus established a competition among playwrights as the major event of the City Dionysia, the procedure required that each contestant submit a sec of three tragedies and a satyr play, a wild farce exploiting the comic potential of overtly sexual elements in Dionysian tradition. Each of the three different dramatic"},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"488 Myths of the Tragic Heroes and Heroines FIGURE 13-2 Dionysus and Satyrs Making Wine. The bearded god of wine joins satyrs (depicted here as men with pointed ears and horse tails) in a vintage revel. According to Aris- totle, tragedy evolved from the dithyramb, a wild, ecstatic dance associated with such Dio- nysian festivals. A highly mutable deity symbolizing the ever-changing forces of physical and human nature, Dionysus is the patron of drama, both the painful reversals of tragedy and the joyous resolution of conflicts in comedy. (Antiken Museum, Basle) categories—tragedy, satyr play, and comedy—staged at the City Dionysia represented a distinct aspect of Dionysus’s complex nature. A jury selected by lot awarded first, second, and third places to three different sets of dramas and their accompanying satyr plays, which were publicly presented on three successive days beginning at dawn. According to a perhaps doubtful tradition, the initial winner of the tragic com- petition was Thespis, who reportedly created the first role for an actor by separating a single performer from the traditional Dionysian chorus of singers and dancers. For the first time, an actor stood in opposition to the choral leader, engaging in dialogue that could lead to true dramatic conflict, the essence of effective theater. Tragedy The new art form that Thespis allegedly introduced, and which Aeschylus later brought to artistic maturity, is called tragedy, a term combining the Greek words tragos (“he-goat”) and oide (“song”). The “goat song” may derive its rustic name from the loincloths of goatskin worn by the all-male chorus. (Women were not permitted to appear onstage, and all roles, including impersonations of Aphrodite, Clytemnes- tra, and Ffelen of Troy, were filled by men wearing masks, wigs, and long robes.) According to another theory, “goat song” refers to the attendees’ shouts and chants performed when a goat was sacrificed on Dionysus’s altar to inaugurate the dramatic productions. Whatever the origin of its name, tragedy {tragoidid} rapidly became the dominant force for reinterpreting the significance of old myths for the Athenian pub- lic. Crowds of 15,000 or more packed the theater of Dionysus—a semicircular am- phitheater cut into the south flank of the Acropolis (Figure 13-3)—to witness the latest adaptations of myth in new works of dramatic art.

The transformation of ancient Greek myth into dramatic presentations began in Athens about 535-534 B.C. as part of a citywide festival honoring Dionysus. At that time, the Athenian tyrant Pisistratus established a contest among playwrights, whose tragedies were staged in an open-air amphi- theater on the slopes of the Acropolis. The original theater of Dionysus, where all the plays of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides had their premieres, was extensively reconstructed in the fourth century B.C. The scene pictured here shows the Acropolis area, including the much later theater of Herodes Atticus (lower left), as it appeared toward the end of the second cen- tury A. D. (Reconstruction by Al N. Oikonomides) daurus [Figure 13-4] stands as the best-preserved theater in Greece and is still used for the performance of classical tragedy.) After witnessing his premiere tragedy, Thespis’s first audience is said to have asked in disgust, “What has this to do with Dionysus?” Although Dionysus’s shrine, altar, and priest were featured prominently in the theater, Thespis—like most of the play- wrights who followed him — did not confine himself to staging episodes from Dio- nysian myth. Tragedy was firmly committed to the spirit of the wine god, with his tragic suffering, death, resurrection, and ascension to heaven, but from the begin- ning, Greek dramatists freely used myths about other gods and heroes as their pri- mary subject matter. Only one surviving tragedy, Euripides’ Bacchae (c. 406 B.C.), features Dionysus as a leading character, although he appears in some comedies, such as Aristophanes’ Frogs (405 B.C.). The two plays offer startlingly different portraits of the wine god; Euripides presents Dionysus as an irresistible natural force that destroys all who oppose it, whereas Aristophanes shows the deity as a (relatively) good-natured drunk interested in restoring theatrical productions to the high standards they had before the deaths of Sophocles and Euripides in 406 B.C.

The best-preserved theater in Greece, the great amphitheater at Epidaurus is still used for performances of classical tragedy and modern op- era. Although drama was an Athenian invention, the art form quickly became popular and spread throughout the Greek world, resulting in the building of theaters like this one in Greece, Sicily, Italy, and Ionia. Many Greek theaters had such good acoustics that well- trained actors could project their speeches with near-perfect clarity even to the back rows. of scanning a plays printed text that most readers experience today. Besides being a religious celebration that explored mysteries of life and death, dramatic presentations were communal events in which heightened emotions and sometimes shocking new insights were shared simultaneously by thousands of people. The bare bones of a tragedy’s script, which is all that remains to us, cannot convey the visual and auditory spectacle of the majestic ritual—accompanied by music and dance—in which Oedi- pus’s self-deceptions were inexorably peeled away or Medea’s scheme to murder her own children moved, without a hint of divine interference, toward its unspeakable fulfillment. Catharsis Uniting word and music to engage both intellect and emotion, Greek tragedy strives for an immediate and powerful impact on its audience. Aristotle defined tragedy in terms of the emotional response it elicited: by arousing strong feelings of pity and fear in the spectator, tragedy is able to relieve or purge these emotions, achieving catharsis. Thus, tragedy’s ultimate effect is to produce not de- pression, but exhilaration, a conscious lightening of emotive burdens. The Satyr Play Whereas Athenian tragedy underscored the terrifying unpredictability of change that can suddenly transform the lives of city-states and their leaders, the satyr play (which followed a series of three tragedies) provided a welcome alternative to confronting pain. Like tragedy, satyric drama used mythical plots and characters, but it did not take them seriously. The chorus, invariably composed of Dionysus’s lewdly energetic half-human satyrs (Figure 13-5), wore horses’ tails and ears and sported huge artificial penises, emblems of the god’s sensuality and procreativity. The satyrs’ humorous an- tics and obscene jokes provoked audience laughter, a counterbalance to tragedy’s evo- cation of pity and fear."},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"The Theater of Dionysus and the Tragic Vision 491 FIGURE 13-5 A Maenad and a Satyr. Heads thrown back in rapture, these wildly dancing figures display the effects of ecstasy—literally the standing outside of oneself, the escape from individual self-awareness to experience a sense of unity with their god. Liberating people from the constraints of reason and custom, Dionysian possession permitted extremes of feeling and behavior, a freedom to express instinctual drives and appetites, appropriately represented by the satyr, who combines bestial and human traits. The animal component of the uninhibited psyche is also implied by the snake coiled around the maenad’s left arm and by the panther accompanying the horse-tailed satyr. Innocent of civilized taboos, the satyr unselfconsciously pursues the satisfaction of emotional and sexual impulses, a characteristic acknowledged and honored in the satyr plays presented after the tragic dramas. (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) Most satyr plays have been lost. Only Euripides’ Cyclops, a burlesque of Odysseus’s encounter with the Cyclops Polyphemus (from the Odyssey), survives complete. Parts of Aeschylus’s Drawers of Nets and Sophocles’ Trackers also exist in fragmental form.

(State Museum, Berlin) creating the forerunner of comic dialogue. The Greek word for comedy, komoidia, means “komos-singing” and is derived from the word komos, meaning “parade of revelers.” Exploiting the humor inherent in humanity’s (and the gods’) diverse sexual activity, comedy offers a positive dimension to tragedy’s solemn worldview. Like the satyr play, comedy promotes reconciliation of conflict and a reintegration of the dis- parate elements composing the Dionysian life force. The Tragic Vision The dramatic festival in honor of Dionysus took place in a society that saw itself as an embodiment of the spirit of Apollo, by now associated with moderation, self- control, and enlightenment through the pursuit of knowledge. The democratic con- stitution established in Athens in 508 B.C. was itself a model of Apollonian rational- ism, with its system of checks and balances, its principle of the rule of the majority of citizens, and its use of debating and voting as the instruments of problem solving. The ancient Apollonian way, which encouraged awareness of one’s human limita- tions, and of one’s place in the social and universal order, was precisely appropriate for a democratic society. An essentially conservative people, however, despite the remarkable political changes they had instituted, the citizens of Athens and its sister city-states in Greece retained the old mythic heroes, even while rethinking their relationship to life in an urban, democratic state. Democracy requires a well-informed citizenry capable of self-restraint and committed in principle and practice to the willingness to compro-"},{"pageNumber":521,"pageContent":"The Theater of Dionysus and the Tragic Vision 493 mise, to abide by the will of the majority. There was clearly a gap between the old heroes, who always “go forward” and refuse to compromise, and the ideal citizen of the new city-state. The perfect expression of a feudal society in which the warrior is king, the old-style “hero” no longer fits comfortably into a world in which all citizens are “equal” by law. Further, for the exceptional, “heroic” individual, Apollo’s demands for self- knowledge and moderation in all things are inherently contradictory: what the tragic protagonist knows—when he or she truly acquires self-knowledge—is precisely the capacity for extremes of feeling and behavior that define the hero’s extraordinary na- ture. The path to self-knowledge that Dionysus provides differs markedly from that of Apollo, a “binder” god who asks that we be reasonable and obey the rules. Dio- nysus, on the other hand, is a god of release and as such is much more in keeping with the heroic spirit. The Dionysian drive toward self-exploration through freedom, through exuber- ance, through a breaking down of the barriers of inhibition and prohibition, reveals the full range of one’s potentialities, however irrational and even terrifying those might be. Thus, the tragedies that open each Dionysian festival plunge one into the realm of the chaotic forces within the human mind, beyond the reach of the outer world of reason and moral imperatives. There, one must explore urges—including incest, matricide or patricide, and infanticide—that violate the most basic taboos of civilized life. By bursting beyond such absolute and universal limits, however, the actions of the tragic protagonist provoke awesome and terrifying cosmic reactions. Thus, tragedy makes possible—even demands—an awareness of one’s connection to the incomprehensible and thus seemingly irrational mysteries of the universe. As the English poet William Blake wrote, “The road of excess leads to the palace of wis- dom.” Between these two divergent paths—of Dionysian freedom and Apollonian restraint, of instinct and taboo, of nature and civilization, of internal psychological needs and external social responsibilities—lies the uncharted territory that the pro- tagonist (main character) of Greek tragedy must traverse. Myth into Drama Drama is an ideal vehicle for raising questions or exploring possibilities. In drama, there is no narrative voice, as there is in fiction (or epic), that tells us how to respond to the story—assuring us, for example, despite occasional appearances to the con- trary, that Odysseus was a “wise and pious man” who therefore deserved to be re- warded by the gods. In drama, each character speaks and acts in ways that reflect only his or her personal motives or points of view. By setting various characters in motion and allowing them to state their conflicting views, the dramatist creates several dif- ferent perspectives on any action that occurs and leaves them for the audience to contemplate. Greek dramatists were not expected to create original plots for their tragedies. Rather, the tragedies were all based on inherited myths. But in transforming myths into dramatic form, the tragedies combined the intrinsic potentialities of the original myths with the heroic aspirations of the epic traditions, as well as with the spirit of the ritual of Dionysus during which they were performed. Further, authors often"},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"494 Myths of the Tragic Heroes and Heroines took advantage of the multiple perspectives of the dramatic medium to question accepted views, to probe conventional responses, and to explore new approaches to experience. The Tragic Hero Like the heroes of the epics from whom the tragic protagonists are probably at least in part descended, the tragic protagonists are noble, both in lineage and in character. But perhaps because the tragedies were all performed live before the eyes of an urban audience, they updated the mythic materials and expressed the heroes’ qualities in slightly more realistic, or at least accessible, ways. Thus, instead of tracing their de- scent from the gods, the heroes are often members of leading families; instead of performing incredible feats of physical prowess and courage in battle, they exhibit unusual moral courage and integrity. The myths that the writers of tragedy selected to dramatize, too, are often about domestic problems that involve violence: marital quarrels, sibling rivalry, incest, or the murder of a wife, husband, parent, or child. And though epic heroes may descend to Hades, the hell to which the tragic heroes descend often lies within the tormented recesses of their own minds. Like the epic heroes, the tragic heroes possess extraordinary qualities. And like their epic predecessors, it is often their unique gifts that both get them into terrible predicaments and allow them to rise above those same predicaments. It is Oedipus’s determination and skill at solving riddles that are the source of his greatness; it is that very same determination and skill that bring about the confrontation with the truth that proves his own undoing. Similarly, in Sophocles’ earliest play about the family of Oedipus, it is Antigone’s moral commitment—her respect for the dead—that brings about both her courageous defiance and her martyrdom. Trapped between conflicting demands, both external and internal, possessing na- tures whose best qualities, under duress, often prove self-destructive, the tragic heroes are doomed to suffer. And because they are important people, their suffering ripples outward, encompassing others. The role of the tragic hero, however (perhaps like that of the scapegoat in the Dionysian ritual who took on the sins of the community and was sacrificed in order to relieve the worshipers of the burden of sin), is to take the communal suffering on him- or herself. The epic hero Achilles, by his ex- traordinary martial prowess, becomes the Greeks’ point man, the major target of Trojan soldiers. So Oedipus takes the people’s sorrows on himself, sending to the oracle to deal with their needs; so Orestes assumes the burden Apollo thrusts on him, of avenging the injustice of Agamemnon’s murder; so Oedipus’s daughter Antigone singlehandedly takes on the duty of preserving moral law in her community. Only by plumbing the depths of pain can the tragic protagonist explore the limits of human knowledge. Like the mythic heroes, the tragic protagonists expand the parameters of human experience. But where heroes like Heracles pushed back geographic boundaries, the tragic protagonists push back psychic boundaries, bursting through the barriers of habit, convention, and comfortable illusion. “Man must suffer to be wise,” says the chorus in Aeschylus’s play Agamemnon; alternatively, as Sophocles’ Tiresias (in Oedi- pus Rex) puts it, “To be wise is to suffer.” The mythic and epic heroes embark on physical quests and learn through painful experience—such as losing one’s best"},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":"The Theater of Dionysus and the Tragic Vision 495 FIGURE 13-7 Orpheus Playing Flis Lyre. A mythic figure who experiences the loss, spiri- tual growth, and acquisition of insight through sufferings that characterize the tragic hero. Orpheus also has the tragic protagonist’s ability to articulate a poetic response to the griefs he experiences. Music—in the form of instrum^ental playing, choral song, and dance—was an integral part of the tragic performance, as it was to Orpheus as a symbol of the creative artist. This vase painting shows Orpheus singing for the young men of Thrace, perhaps only mo- ments before frenzied maenads are to tear him to shreds—a sparagmos he shares not only with Dionysus but also with tragic figures such as Pentheus. (Staatliche Museen, Berlin) friend in battle or watching one’s fellows be eaten by monsters—or through direct confrontation with the ultimate suffering (death) via the descent to the Underworld. Tragedy typically turns these heroic quests inward: the tragic heroes suffer an inner torment of their own, a kind of psychological sparagmos, and the depth of their anguish is the measure of their heroism (Figure 13-7). “Suffering is the sole origin of consciousness,” wrote the Russian novelist Dosto- yevsky in a statement that might aptly describe the tragic protagonist. Conversely, the inability to suffer, or to perceive or experience horror, characterizes the morally blind—for example, in Aeschylus’s Agamemnon, even when directly presented with the truth, the chorus refuses to see it and only reiterates, like a verbal talisman, “May good prevail in the end.” At the opposite end of the scale, too much suffering pro- duces unconsciousness and, ultimately, death (permanent unconsciousness). Con- sciousness and the awareness of pain are the conditions of a morally responsible ex- istence. Unwilling to face the horror of her life, Oedipus’s wife, Jocasta, commits suicide. Unable to confront the tragic burden of suffering, both the chorus and Jo- casta are dramatic foils (contrasts) to the tragic hero: to live on the unbearable pin- nacle of agony without the merciful unconsciousness of death is Oedipus’s tragic fate."},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":"496 Myths of the Tragic Heroes and Heroines Similarly, the chorus of Trojan slave women in the Libation-Bearers may cheer when Orestes kills Clytemnestra: they aren’t the ones who have to confront the Furies and are, in fact, blind to their presence. While the chorus celebrates victory, it is Orestes who suffers torment. The Tragic Universe Such tragedies tend to depict the universe in a very particular and characteristic way. The universe is governed by divine beings whose presence, actual or implied, gives significance to the actions of the human beings whose lives the gods affect; however, the universe is anthropocentric (human centered). The gods affect human lives, but their responses to human actions are utterly unpredictable. Communication between humans and gods is not as easy as it was in the myths and epics, when the gods came down and spoke with human beings directly. In the world of the tragedies, direct, unmediated communication with the gods does occur (as in Euripides’ Bacchae), but more rarely. Apollo and Athene do not stroll casually along the streets of downtown Athens chatting with the heroes, as they did at Troy or Ithaca. Such communication is more usually indirect—through rituals, prayers, prophecies, oracles—and thus subject to misinterpretation. The gods speak in riddles, and the humans struggle to understand in whatever ways they can, often with devastating results. But it is given in the heroes’ natures that they will insist on trying, on blindly confronting the invis- ible limits of the cosmic order head-on, using whatever tools—reason, moral integ- rity, courage, persistence-—are at their disposal. The Tragic Mystery The tragic universe, furthermore, is not morally neat: justice does not always prevail, nor can humans count on the gods to reward virtue and punish evil. The gods’ actions are often incomprehensible, and the more the heroes persist in trying to penetrate the mystery, the more they suffer. Just as the epic heroes’ efforts to achieve literal immortality are doomed, so the efforts of the tragic heroes to find clarity, to assert the rational need for a moral universe, invariably fail. Even for the most gifted, well-intentioned heroes, there is no certainty. Things unaccountably change: peripeteia [pair-ih-pe-TEE-uh] (reversal), as Aristotle originally pointed out, defines the tragic experience. In the world of the tragedies, questions like “why do bad things happen to good people?” have no clear-cut answers beyond a recognition of the mystery at the heart of the universe: the gods are mysterious to humans; they exist and make often impossible demands on us, but we cannot clearly ascertain or comprehend what they really want of us. Moral Freedom Although humans cannot hope to understand the gods, they can at least understand the consequences of their own actions. Thus, in the ambiguous, often paradoxical world of the tragedies, the protagonist typically accepts responsi- bility for his or her fate, regardless of what the gods may or may not have done to bring it about. Fated or not, we must act as if we are free. In so doing, in rejecting the role of victim and defining ourselves as free moral agents, we wrench human existence out of the hands of the gods and reclaim it as our own. Through intense struggle and sacrifice, the tragic protagonist achieves a kind of moral transcendence that is both ennobling in itself and reassuring of the value of the struggle."},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"The Theater of Dionysus and the Tragic Vision 497 Often culminating in a sudden burst of insight beyond the limits of ordinary sense experience, the tragic hero’s experience corresponds loosely with the epiphany and consequent communion of the Dionysian ritual. As scholars have noted, the original ritual was also cathartic. The irrational drives were called up and released, allowing the worshiper to continue to function within the confines of ordinary, civilized life. So, too, in tragedy, order is restored in the world of the play: plagues and civil disrup- tions end; Furies are given socially useful tasks. This restoration comes, of course, at the price of enormous sacrifice. We cannot return, exactly, to our previous condition: we have looked into the abyss and will not readily forget its presence looming beneath our feet. But for the struggle to continue, the community must survive. Thus, tragedy prepares the way for what follows: the release of tension in the satyr play and the confirmation and reintegration in the comedy that concludes the dramatic festival. Only in the experience of the entire dramatic cycle can Apollo and Dionysus at last be reconciled. The bdcchdC: Euripides Tragic Vision The only surviving tragedy that features Dionysus in a leading role is not only one of the last Greek dramas written but also one of the most perplexing. Composed about 406 B.C., shortly before Euripides’ death, the Bacchae dramatizes the myth of Dionysus’s return to Thebes, his birthplace, where the god exacts a horrific revenge on his native city for its citizens’ failure to honor his divinity. In this play, Euripides takes the Athenian theater back to its Dionysian roots, the wine god’s ecstatic cult, and explores the implications of its passionate, potentially destructive nature. To many modern readers, the Bacchae is genuinely disturbing, in part because neither of its leading characters—Dionysus or Pentheus [PEN-thee-uhs], king of Thebes— seems particularly sympathetic. The wine god appears violent and merciless, while Pentheus is revealed as a hollow figure, his stubborn opposition to Dionysian religion a product of his fatal inability to confront Dionysian elements in himself. In exposing Pentheus’s personal flaws, particularly the young ruler’s refusal to take wise advice or compromise his overly rigid position, Euripides also highlights the old myth’s rele- vance to democratic society. Like the unbending Creon in Sophocles’ Antigone, Pen- theus fails as a political leader because he values only his own viewpoint, foolishly ignoring representatives of the larger community. As the prophet Tiresias warns Pen- theus, “The powerful man who matches insolence with glibness is worse than a fool. He is a public danger!” The Bacchae is named for its chorus, a group of foreign women passionately de- voted to Dionysus, also known as Bacchus. These bacchants, who have followed their god from Asia Minor to Greece, worship Dionysus voluntarily and gratefully, revel- ing in the emotional freedom and sense of joyous unity with nature that he imparts (Figure 13-8). Their opening song, in which the Asian bacchants dance wildly, prais- ing Dionysus’s holy and irresistible gifts, is the only extant example of a dithyramb, the ancient choral ode associated with Dionysus’s prehistoric rituals (Figure 13-9). By contrast, a group of Theban women, who do not appear on stage until near the drama’s conclusion, perform the god’s rites unwillingly, under divine compulsion.

As a young satyr pipes, a bare-breasted maenad dances, clad only in a scanty leopard skin. Pentheus assumes that any woman allowed the freedom to express her inner feelings during Dionysian orgies will totally abandon her civilized roles, in- dulging in sexual excess. (British Museum, London) Besides illustrating the dangerous folly of human insensitivity to divine visitations, the playwright also explores the tragic character flaws causing the Theban leaders’ spiritual blindness. Ironically, the trait that prompts Pentheus’s stubborn opposition to Dionysian freedom is his lack of Apollonian self-knowledge, a defect that leads him to commit hubris [FfYOO-bris], or excessive pride. Unable to understand him- self, including the Dionysian aspects of his own nature, he also violates Apollo’s edict against excess, foolishly pitting his human will against divine force. Contemptuously rejecting the claim that Zeus had fathered the child that his aunt Semele had myste- riously borne, Pentheus compounds his blasphemy by imprisoning Dionysus and condemning him to death.

According to this etiological myth, Cadmus, the son of the Phoenician King Agenor, was dispatched to search for his sister Europa after she had been abducted by Zeus. When consulting the Oracle at Delphi, he was told to found a city where a cow lay down. This led Cadmus to the site of Thebes, where he killed its guardian dragon (Figure 13-11) and sowed the dragon’s teeth, from which a throng of young warriors sprang up. Most of the dragon- born crew immediately killed each other in hand-to-hand combat, but five, including Echion, were still living when Cadmus founded Thebes. Although the Bacchae re- peatedly mentions that Cadmus passed the city’s rulership on to his young grandson Pentheus, tradition offers no clue to Echion’s disappearance from the scene. Born to the aunt of a god and a man derived from the primordial Goddess’s ser- pent, Pentheus should be expected to recognize his cousin’s divinity, making his ada- mant refusal to do so all the more puzzling. As Euripides makes clear, however, Pen- theus’s relentlessly hostile reaction to the young stranger, garlanded in ivy and bearing a thyrsus, who suddenly shows up to wreak havoc in Thebes springs from a deep anxiety about his own sexual identity: the young king sees in the seductive youth too much of what he fears in himself (Figure 13-12). Euripides’ Dionysus appears wear- ing the mask of a slight, rather effeminate young man, whose long golden curls and suspicious preference for women’s company Pentheus derisively mocks. But the Eu- ripidean Pentheus also wears a mask, posing ostentatiously as a tough soldier who bravely guards his city against the kind of foreign defilement that the stranger tries to introduce. A stalwart defender of Greek masculinity, Pentheus condemns Dionysus’s worshiper as his moral opposite; soft, undisciplined, vain, and ineffectual. In fact, Dionysus and Pentheus share important qualities, including sensuality, socially pro- hibited desires, and a will to power, but whereas these attributes are a source of strength to the god, they trigger his mortal opponent’s disgrace and destruction."},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"The Theater of Dionysus and the Tragic Vision 501 FIGURE 13-11 Cadmus and the Serpent. Athenian playwrights seemed to delight in dramatizing the tragic errors promulgated by the rulers of Thebes, which was one of Athens’s most bitter enemies at the time Euripides wrote the Bacchae (c. 406 B.C.). In Euripides’ play, the aged Cadmus, Thebes’s mythical founder, suffers both exile and loss of his humanity, condemned by Dionysus to be changed into a serpent. Cadmus’s transformation is an ironic reversal of his earlier heroic act of killing a serpent (dragon) that once guarded the site of Thebes. Following Athene’s advice, Cadmus sowed the dragon’s teeth, out of which sprang a band of armed warriors, the Spartoi, who fought one another until only five were left. One of the survivors, Echion, married Cadmus’s daughter Agave and became the father of Pentheus. In this bowl, Cadmus advances with drawn sword toward the rearing serpent. (Louvre, Paris) Pentheus’s Transformation In the play’s major reversal (peripeteia), the two leading characters’ respective masks are stripped away, revealing that each is the opposite of what he had previously ap- peared. At the outset, Pentheus—king, soldier, and law enforcer—ostensibly has the power to humiliate and kill the stranger whose effeminacy so outrages him, mak- ing Dionysus’s supposed priest a legal sacrifice to his masculine authority. Midway through the play, however, Dionysus takes charge of the action, manipulating Pen- theus into unmasking his feminine component, the androgynous traits he found so disturbing in the stranger. Every man in Euripides’ audience must have cringed when the actor portraying a Greek military leader reappeared on stage outfitted in a woman’s wig, gown, and flowing veil. The feminine self that Pentheus displays is not the wise anima of a mature human being, however, but the caricature of a sim- pering, preening female, coyly adjusting her Bacchic regalia and flirting with the stranger. At this point, Pentheus and Dionysus have changed places: the god has assumed total control, and the king who tried to execute him will become his sacri- ficial victim."},{"pageNumber":530,"pageContent":"502 Myths of the Tragic Heroes and Heroines FIGURE 13-12 A Resting Sa- tyr.

Refusing to recognize that Dionysus embodies the instinctual passion inherent in every human psyche—and is therefore a divine power that only fools ignore—Pentheus suffers the supreme penalty for failing to know himself. Denying Bacchus the proper sacrifice owed the god, he himself becomes the ritual sacrifice, his dismemberment reenacting Dionysus’s own sparagmos by the Titans (see Chapter 8)."},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"The Theater of Dionysus and the Tragie Vision 503 FIGURE 13-13 The Death of Pentheus. Refusing to accept the religious validity of Dionysian irrationality, Pentheus becomes its victim.

This Pompeiian fresco vividly illustrates the hallucinatory quality of religious frenzy and its potential for fanatical violence. (National Archaeological Museum, Naples) Like his cousin Actaeon [ak-TEE-ahn], who offended Artemis and was consequently torn to pieces by his hunting dogs (Figure 13-14), Pentheus learns too late the ab- solute necessity of respecting the gods’ prerogatives. As Pentheus replays the scene of Dionysian suffering, the god changes his physical shape to reflect the bestial energies previously concealed when he appeared as a lan- guid adolescent. Manifesting his divine-animal unity, Dionysus is simultaneously a horned bull, a lion, and a luminous deity.

The young hunter Actaeon, son of Cadmus’s daughter Autonoe—and therefore also a cousin of Pentheus—is torn to pieces by his fifty hunting dogs on the hills of Cithaeron outside Thebes. According to one account, he ac- cidentally observes the nude Artemis bathing, for which intrusion the goddess incites his hounds against him. Actaeon’s sparagmos foreshadows that of Pentheus. (James Fund and by Special Contributions. Courtesy, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston) A^ave Pentheus’s nagging fear of what may result if human nature is liberated from its so- cially imposed restraints is abundantly justified in the manner of his death—at the hands of his own mother. Agave. Divine possession removes traditional inhibitions, allowing Agave to realize her potential in purely masculine roles, reversing the socially prescribed dichotomy between male and female. As racer, hunter, fighter, and exe- cutioner, she proves the equal of any Theban soldier. But the cost of her liberation is tragically high, paradoxically stripping Agave of her freedom of rational choice. Although the Bacchae may present Agave primarily as an object lesson in the folly of resisting divine power, her plight suggests other possibilities as well. In throwing off societal prohibitions, she reveals a startling kinship with Artemis, the goddess who eschews traditionally feminine duties, such as motherhood and weaving, to pursue savage beasts in the wilderness. Like Artemis, Agave not only revels in the freedom to hunt and use weapons but also enacts the goddess’s prerogative to inflict sparagmos on any male who dares to invade her sacred privacy. As Artemis incites the mutilation and death of Actaeon, so Agave dismembers the man who spies on women’s mysteries. That her victim turns out to be her own son dramatizes the tragic alternatives avail- able to women in a patriarchal society: the inner destruction of the psyche that results from oppression and lack of opportunity to achieve real fulfillment in the world of action or the outer destruction of murdering husbands or children. As a goddess and childless (although associated with childbirth), Artemis escapes"},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"The Theater of Dionysus and the Tragic Vision 505 the dilemma that entangles such human figures as Agave, Medea, and Clytemnestra. As a mortal woman and a mother, however. Agave is trapped, with no avenue of escape. The tragic nature of her predicament is evident when Agave, believing that she has killed a lion with her bare hands, compares herself to Heracles—an ironic comparison that highlights the differences between their situations. Heracles, too, incurred blood guilt when, in a fit of madness, he slew his wife and children. In sharp contrast to Agave, however, Heracles was given a way to expiate his crime: he is sent on a series of quests that allow him to fulfill his heroic nature. Agave, who has staged a similarly deadly rebellion against domesticity, is permitted no redemptive action but is condemned to permanent exile. Euripides creates one of the most powerful anagnorisis (recognition) scenes in all drama when he shows Agave, carrying Pentheus’s severed head, in a struggle against a return to ordinary reality. Her desperate attempts to remain under Dionysus’s spell, to avoid confronting the results of her terrible experiment with total freedom, pro- duce one of the most painful scenes of madness ever devised for the theater. Having been forced to experience Dionysian ecstasy and coerced into releasing a killer instinct that she loathes. Agave is in a unique position to assess the value of Bacchanalian frenzy (as depicted in Figures 13-6 and 13-9). With returning sanity, she realizes that the god has violated the integrity of her personality, blinded her moral vision, robbed her of choice, and exploited her hitherto unexpected potential for aggression and impulsive violence. Agave’s rationalism, which made her unable to believe that Semele’s child was Zeus-begotten, resembles that of Jocasta, the unhappy wife of Oedipus, who is similarly punished for doubting that the gods personally influence human affairs (see Chapter 16). At the end of the play. Agave makes the only gesture of freedom still available to her: she rejects Dionysus and all he stands for. She resolves to go as far from “cursed Cithaeron” as possible, to a place where the thyrsus and Dionysian revels are unknown. Guilty of shedding a kinsman’s blood. Agave is not allowed to join Pentheus in death: polluted and exiled, she must wander the earth to ponder and suffer the consequences of having discovered her affinity with nature’s animal savagery. Agave’s decisive rejection of divine possession echoes in other myths: according to one story, the bereaved mother’s scorn for Dionysus was so strong that, in exile from Thebes, she climbed a tree and lay in wait to attack him with a weapon. As the gods’ human pawn. Agave resembles Cassandra, a Trojan princess who was also Apollo’s prophet. Both women find that union with a god, despite its emotional gratification, is a poisonous gift that deprives them of personal autonomy and mental peace. Just as Apollo stripped Cassandra of her credibility when she repulsed his advances, so Dionysus arbitrarily deprives Agave of the civilized bonds that would keep her from acting on the incipient violence in her soul. Driven into madness by the machinations of their divine patrons. Agave and Cassandra illustrate the paradox of religious com- mitment: while offering unparalleled rapture and insight, the gods punish mercilessly those who give less than complete submission. Agave’s mental independence, her skepticism about Semele’s conception, and Cassandra’s wish to keep her body invio- late, even from Apollo, spark the wrath of the gods, who demand unconditional surrender. The opposing claims of religious devotion and Greek humanism are not easily reconciled—except in the Asian maenads, who claim to have found grace and peace in Dionysian possession."},{"pageNumber":534,"pageContent":"506 Myths of the Tragic Heroes and Heroines Tiresias In contrast to Agave and Pentheus, Apollo’s prophet Tiresias does not hesitate to accept the wine god as Zeus’s legitimate son. Although aged and blind, Tiresias decks himself out in the Bacchic regalia, advising Pentheus not to resist the divine will. The only character in the play whom Dionysus does not punish, Tiresias successfully balances the unavoidable contrarieties of control and freedom. Although Euripides does not refer to it, his audience probably would have been familiar with another myth involving Tiresias’s uncanny ability to assimilate polar opposites. Having been changed from man to woman and back again, Tiresias can appreciate Dionysian mutability and androgyny (see Chapter 16). Appearing in vir- tually every myth associated with Thebes’s ill-fated royal house, Tiresias typically offers advice that all rulers, from Cadmus and Pentheus to Oedipus and Creon, un- wisely reject. He retains his prophetic powers even after death, continuing to foretell the future in Hades (see Odyssey, Book 11, in Chapter 12). Tiresias’s accommodation of both Apollo and Dionysus, masculine control and androgynous surrender, parallels Delphi’s historic accommodation of two radically different aspects of godhood. By making room for Dionysus—his temple also stood on the flanks of Mount Parnassus—the Delphic compromise between the conflicting demands of mental lucidity and sensuous abandon helped to contain (and control) incipiently dangerous human tendencies. Acknowledging its inevitability, Delphi— and democratic Athens—honored the principle of irrationality by creating institu- tions to give it limited expression, restricting Dionysian revels to annually scheduled festivals. Cadmus: Expediency No Substitute for Passion Although Cadmus, the aged dragon slayer, also appears to honor the new god, his reverence is only lip service. Cadmus’s advice urging Pentheus to accept Dionysus insults the god by its shallow expediency: Pentheus should at least pretend he believes that Zeus was Semele’s lover, for such a rumor enhances the status of Thebes’s royal house. Disdaining such lukewarm acquiescence, Dionysus condemns Cadmus to ex- ile and eventual transformation into a serpent, reducing the former king in old age to the status of a reptile he had slain in his prime. Dionysus’s Pitiless Judgment Like Zeus in Aeschylus’s Prometheus Bound, the triumphant Dionysus is incapable of pity, oblivious to Agave’s pain or Cadmus’s despair. In Euripides’ final scene, com- passion for human suffering is no more part of the divine character than it is of nature, which sheds no tears for victims of earthquake, cyclone, or flood. An aspect of nature that transcends moral judgment, Dionysus is as implacable as Hades or Persephone. In Euripides’ mythic vision, sympathy and concern for others’ anguish are strictly human responses to tragic loss: Agave and Cadmus can express pity for each other’s suffering, but the god—impervious to everything but the brute fact of his power—cannot connect with mortals foolish enough to reject his divine reality."},{"pageNumber":535,"pageContent":"The Theater of Dionysus and the Tragic Vision 507 Dionysus of Thebes and Jesus of Nazareth In the Bacchae, Tiresias points out to Pentheus that Demeter and Dionysus have given humanity two indispensable gifts: grain to sustain life and wine to make life bearable. He tells Pentheus; This new God whom you dismiss, no words of mine can attain the greatness of his coming power in Greece. Young man, rw'o are the forces most precious to mankind. The first is Demeter, the Goddess. She is the Earth — or any name you wish to call her— and she sustains humanity with solid food. Next comes the son of the virgin, Dionysus, bringing the counterpart to bread, wine and the blessings of life’s flowing juices. His blood, the blood of the grape, lightens the burden of our mortal misery. When, after their daily toils, men drink their fill, sleep comes to them, bringing release from all their troubles. There is no other cure for sorrow. Though himself a God, it is his blood we pour out to offer thanks to the Gods. And through him, we are blessed. —EURIPIDES, Bacchae, trans. Michael Cacoyannis Bread and/or wine, tangible emblems of divine care for mortals, played important roles in some Greco-Roman mystery religions, where food and beverage emblematic of earth’s fecundity furnished sacred dining tables at which initiates communed with their gods. Christian writers frame Jesus’ public ministry with feasts involving bread and wine. In John’s Gospel, Jesus’ first miraculous act is to change water into wine at a Jewish wedding, a “sign” of his divinity that seems to mimic the wine-making magic of some Dionysian priests. In the Gospels of Mark, Matthew, and Luke (but not, strangely, in John), Jesus hosts a final Passover dinner with his friends at which he announces that the bread he disburses is his “body” and the wine he passes around his “blood.” The next day, Roman soldiers execute him, his wounding and crucifixion a form of sparagmos, the ritual sacrifice of God’s beloved son. The Gospels also state that partway through his career of miraculous healings and exorcisms, when large crowds flocked to him seeking cures for their afflictions, Jesus returned to his hometown of Nazareth—only to have his former neighbors publicly doubt his supernatural abilities and reject his authority. Mark tells the story most baldly: Then he [Jesus] left that place, and he comes to his hometown and his disciples follow him. When the sabbath day arrived, he started teaching in the synagogue; and many who heard him were astounded and said so: “Where’s he getting this?” and “What’s the source of all this wisdom?” and “Who gave him the right to perform such miracles? This is the Carpen- ter, isn’t it? Isn’t he Mary’s son? And who are his brothers, if not James and Judas and Simon? And who are his sisters, if not our neighbors?” And they were resentful of him."},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":"508 Myths of the Tragic Heroes and Heroines Jesus used to tell them: “No prophet goes without respect, except on his home turf and among his relatives and at home!” He was unable to perform a single miracle there, except that he did cure a few by laying hands on them, though he was always shocked at their lack of trust. (Mark 6; 1-6, Scholar’s Version) In describing the hero’s return to the scene of his early life, Mark notes that he is received without “respect” or “trust.” No one in Nazareth recognizes that “Mary’s son” is a figure of divine origin: the reference to Jesus as his mother’s child implies illegitimacy; in Israelite tradition a male is always identified by his father’s name. Defining Jesus solely by his blood relationships—mother, brothers, and sisters—the Nazarenes make it impossible for him to demonstrate his divine powers. “Shocked at their lack of trust,” the one who routinely works miracles abroad among strangers was “unable to perform a single miracle there.” In Luke’s version of the episode, the author introduces a telling incident absent in Mark’s account: the people of Nazareth not only reject Jesus’ claims to supernatural gifts but try to kill him. Everyone in the synagogue was filled with rage when they heard [Jesus speak]. They rose up, ran him out of town, and led him to the brow of the hill on which the town was built, intending to hurl him over it. But he slipped away through the throng and went on his way. (Luke 4:28-30, Scholar’s Version) Like the citizens of Thebes who refused to believe that the son of Zeus had been born among them and had now unexpectedly returned to offer spiritual liberation, the Nazarenes could not recognize Jesus as the Son of God who had come home to heal them. Unlike Dionysus, however, Jesus does not threaten to avenge his slighted di- vinity on the rejecting—and insulting—townspeople. In interpreting the significance of Jesus’ life to a Greco-Roman audience. New Testament authors employed numerous parallels to Dionysian myth. Like the son of Zeus and the mortal Semele, Jesus has a divine father and a human mother; as Dio- nysus is spirited away to hide from Hera’s wrath, so the infant Jesus is taken to Egypt to escape King Herod’s murderous rage; as Dionysus performs miracles to demon- strate his divine sonship, so does Jesus; as the evil Titans inflict sparagmos on Dio- nysus, so the benighted Romans crucify Jesus; as Dionysus descends into Hades’s realm to rescue his mother, so Jesus descends into Tartarus to preach to “spirits in prison”; as Zeus raises the slain Dionysus to immortal life in heaven, so the biblical God resurrects the glorified Jesus to sit at his right hand. The Book of Revelation draws another analogy linking Jesus with Dionysus. Whereas Luke’s Gospel preserves a tradition in which Jesus consistently showed patience and forgiveness toward people who did not value him, the author of Reve- lation does not hesitate to transform the historical Jesus into a cosmic being deter- mined to execute merciless judgment on his enemies. In Revelation’s visions, the nonviolent prophet from Nazareth is portrayed as a traditionally mythic avenger, a divine warrior-king whose second visit to earth is not as a sacrificial lamb but as a ferocious lion, ready to slaughter the multitudes who do not accept his divinity. And now I saw heaven open, and a white horse appear, its rider [Christ] was called Faithful and True; he is a judge with integrity, a warrior for justice.

If the Bacchaes author were to visit contemporary Western society, he would probably not be surprised to find that some elements of Bacchic tradition persist into the twenty-first century.

Describe Dionysus’s relation to the origin of Greek tragedy. Why do you suppose that this particular god, with his passion and unpredictability, became the inspirer of Athe- nian drama, including tragedies, satyr plays, and comedies? Although most surviving Greek plays do not feature the wine god as a major character, why are his nature and spirit relevant to the tragic vision? 2. Discuss the similarities and differences between tragic and epic heroes. What heroic qualities do they share? In what different ways does each accept enormous challenges, descend to the Underworld, and return bearing new insights? Using examples from your readings, explain in what sense each appears to achieve success or failure. 3. Epic heroes are trapped in a paradoxical situation—to pursue immortality, they must risk death. In what sense are tragic heroes similarly caught in a paradox? 4. Peripeteia (reversal) describes the plot of a tragedy; the protagonist begins in an envi- able condition, often possessing wealth, power, and prestige, and ends in an unenviable condition, suffering torment or even death. But the concept of reversal also applies to the tragic vision itself. Explain how this reversal of fortune helps bring about the pro- tagonist’s understanding of the inevitability of change, the limits of human knowledge, or the nature of the gods. 5. Why does Pentheus regard Bacchic ecstasy as a threat to civilization? Is he right in any of his objections to surrendering the rational self to the power of emotional abandon- ment? In presenting his version of the myth, would Euripides urge unconditional ac- ceptance of Dionysian frenzy? Should human beings retain rational control at all times? Should one both acknowledge and resist instinctual passion? 6. Some critics suggest that Dionysus is ethically unacceptable because he is a cruel and vengeful god. Do you think that Euripides’ tragedy provokes moral criticisms of Dio- nysus’s character and vengeful behavior? Is Dionysus presented as a force of nature that transcends standards of human judgment? How does he represent unconscious forces in both external nature and the human psyche? Explain your answer. 7. What do we learn from witnessing a dramatization of Dionysus’s return to his home city and his punishment of close relatives who reject him? Is a prophet invariably denied honor in his hometown? (Compare the myth of the god’s return with the ac- count of Jesus’s rejection by his family and former neighbors in Mark, Chapter 6, and Luke, Chapter 4.) Recommended Reddini Baldry, H. C.

Setting his play in the far distant past, just after Zeus has seized power from the Titans, Aeschylus presents Zeus as a despot, an embodiment of amoral power attempting to rule without justice or mercy. At this early stage of its cosmic evolution, divinity is at war with itself: divine strength (Zeus) is alienatedfrom divine wisdom and compassion (Prometheus). Prometheus Bound, the first in a set ofi three dramas, emphasizes the Titans heroic refusal to submit to Zeus's rule; the other two plays (now lost) probably depicted Zeus's gradual realization that he needed ethical maturity for his administration to survive and his eventual reconciliation with the rebel god Prometheus. A Trdnsformdtion o[ the Prometheus Myth In his Theogony and Works and Days, Hesiod depicted Prometheus, the thief of heav- enly fire, as a wily trickster whose attempts to outwit Zeus are appropriately punished (see Chapter 6).

In his Prometheus Bound, Aeschylus portrays heaven’s king as a despot and his imperial eagle, which he will send to devour the rebel Titan’s liver, as a cruel agent of tyranny, as shown in this Roman statue of the Olympian king. Whereas Hesiod had depicted Prometheus as a wily trickster who deserved his punishment, Aeschylus transformed the myth by making Prometheus a savior of humankind, without whose gift of celestial fire, the symbol of all art and technology, humanity could not have avoided the ex- tinction that Zeus planned for it. (Villa Albani, Rome)"},{"pageNumber":595,"pageContent":"Cosmic Conflict and Evolution 567 subject from Hesiod, the author of Prometheus Bound shows a radically different at- titude toward the characters of both Zeus and Prometheus. Turning Hesiod’s the- ology on its head, the playwright changes the Titan into a champion of freedom and Zeus into a despot who rules without law, justice, or mercy. The Question of Authorship Although most scholars attribute Prometheus Bound to the tragedian Aeschylus (c. 525-456 B.C.), some critics, such as Mark Griffith, question Aeschylean author- ship of the play, ascribing it to another hand, perhaps that of Euphorion, a son of Aeschylus who was also a dramatist (see the Recommended Reading). Certainly, Pro- metheus Bound's highly critical portrait of Zeus differs sharply from Aeschylus’s por- trayal of a wise and just Zeus in the Oresteia (see Chapter 15). Because only six (or seven) of Aeschylus’s ninety plays survive, however, it is impossible to be absolutely sure that the playwright did not, for dramatic effect, vary his picture of Zeus from play to play. The drama’s unflattering picture of Zeus may have shocked its original audience, most of whom supposedly honored the Olympian, in Plato’s phrase, as “the god of gods, who rules according to law.” In Prometheus Bound, Zeus is not the benign divinity worshiped by contemporary Athenian society, but the deity as he was at the very beginning of his reign—raw power untempered by wisdom or compassion (Figure 14-1). Because he is neither omnipotent (all-powerful) nor omniscient (all- knowing), he is vulnerable to fatal error. As Hyginus, an astronomer of the second century A.D., observed: “Zeus [when tricked by Prometheus] did not act with the brains of a god, nor did he foresee everything, as befits a god.” An Evolving Universe In this text, we take the traditional view that Prometheus Bound is the first part of an Aeschylean trilogy, a series of three thematically related plays intended to be per- formed sequentially in a single day. The other two dramas, Prometheus Unbound 2 it\\ 6 . Prometheus the Fire-Carrier, exist only in fragments, primarily in citations from later writers. Enough references to the lost plays remain, however, to suggest that the con- flict in Prometheus Bound represents the painful beginning of a complex evolutionary process in which Zeus—perhaps by developing the qualities appropriate to divin- ity— eventually reconciles with the rebel Titan. Although the means of their reconciliation is not specified, it is clear that Aeschy- lus follows a tradition in which Zeus releases Prometheus from the mountain peak on which he has been impaled. According to Hesiod’s version of the myth, Zeus permits his mortal son Heracles to kill the eagle that repeatedly shreds Prometheus’s liver, chiefly to enhance Heracles’ reputation. For Aeschylus, however, the god’s change of heart is more significant: his evolving Zeus at last comes to value the Titan’s superior wisdom and insight. By the end of the third play, we may assume that Zeus has not only liberated his former enemy but also sponsored his ascension to Olympus, where Prometheus is honored as the divine “fire-carrier.” Making the wise Titan his heavenly companion, Zeus in effect restages his swallowing of Metis, assimilating the Promethean qualities that will equip him to rule wisely and thereby perpetuate his reign."},{"pageNumber":596,"pageContent":"568 Myths of the Tragic Heroes and Heroines FIGURE 14-2 The Creation of Man. In this densely figured scene carved on a Roman sar- cophagus, Prometheus (seated, slightly left of center) acts like a divine potter, fashioning from clay the body of the first man, whose head he cradles on his lap. In a parallel to the birth of Athene (see Figure 1-2), the Olympians are gathered to observe humanity’s creation. The gods’ combined presence, crowding about the as yet unconscious form, suggests that the new creature will be endowed with divine qualities that each deity represents. Although Aeschylus does not explicitly refer to this aspect of the Prometheus myth, he closely identifies the god with humanity, for whose cause Prometheus endures Zeus’s wrath. (NationalMuseum, Naples) Prometheus and Humanity In Prometheus Bound, however, Zeus’s evolutionary growth has only begun: the god- head is divided, causing divine power (Zeus) to war against divine intelligence (Pro- metheus). The play opens with Zeus’s henchmen, the unwilling Fdephaestus along with the allegorical figures of Might and Violence (the qualities by which Zeus then ruled), driving iron spikes through the Titan’s flesh, immobilizing him on a barren crag. Silent during his mutilation, Prometheus later reveals that he stole fire not merely to defy Zeus but to rescue humanity from extinction. Zeus had planned to allow the human race to perish in ignorance and darkness, but Prometheus, feeling pity for helpless mortals, gave them fire and taught them the arts and skills of civili- zation, raising humanity from savagery to a consciousness of its potential. Although Aeschylus does not cite the tradition making Prometheus humanity’s creator (Figure l4-2), he emphasizes the almost complete identification between the Titan and the race for whose benefit he suffers. As the nineteenth-century English romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley realized in his version of Prometheus Unbound, the suffering Titan is an image of the human mind, which, despite its physical bond- age to oppressive rulers, remains free in thought to explore the vast universe and contemplate its eventual liberation.

According to Hesiod, Prometheus is the son of the Titans lapetus and Clymene and the brother of Atlas—whom Zeus condemns to hold up the vault of the sky—and Epimetheus (Afterthought), a dimwit who accepts Pandora on behalf of mankind. Aeschylus, however, makes Prometheus (Forethought) a son of Themis, whom the playwright implicitly identifies with the earth goddess, Gaea, thus associating the rebel Titan with an aspect of earth’s primal and prophetic powers. Although Prometheus had used his intelligence to help Zeus overthrow the Titans, in Prometheus Bound\\\\t must use it to maintain universal absolutes of justice and freedom, principles that Zeus’s despotism threatens to obliterate. human viewpoint, the Titan is a redeemer who endures unspeakable pain for the sake of mortals, whose continued existence he makes possible. From Zeus’s perspective, however, he is a lawbreaker whose arrogance must be punished. As a savior figure who also subverts divine authority, Prometheus reflects the Greeks’ ambivalence to- ward a persistent individualism that can disrupt the public order. Individual rebels, even when championing the right, can collide destructively with legitimate authority, damaging both themselves and the state. Some commentators suggest, in fact, that the play opposes two equally plausible versions of the right. According to Fdesiod, Prometheus is a second-generation Titan, the son of lapetus and Clymene (see Figure 14-3). Aeschylus, however, makes him the child of Themis, whom he implicitly identifies with Gaea, the Earth Mother, generator of gods and primeval source of justice. As a masculine counterpart to wise-counseling Gaea, Themis, and Athene, Prometheus attracts the loyalty of Ocean’s daughters, who com- pose the chorus, a group of singers and dancers who comment on (and often judge) the characters and actions in a Greek play. In Prometheus Bound, the chorus is torn between sympathy for the hero’s suffering and horror at the example of divine retri- bution he represents. When Prometheus refuses to submit to Zeus and thus end his pain, his obstinacy provokes the chorus to charge that he “misses the mark” of wise self-interest. The term Aeschylus and other tragedians use to denote a character’s tragic error is hamartia, a term drawn from archery that means “missing the mark.” Although this is the same word translated as “sin” in English versions of the New Testament, it can apply to any quality or action, such as a mistake in judgment or even an excess of righteousness, that results in failure to hit the target of divine approval. From the chorus’s pragmatic view, Prometheus’s extreme ethical autonomy displays hubris, the blinding pride that typically afflicts the tragic hero (see Ghapters 13 and 15). At the same time, Aeschylus makes it clear that Prometheus willingly bears excru- ciating pain because his is the last free mind in the universe, the sole remaining con- sciousness that can distinguish between absolutes of good and evil (Figure l4-4). To corrupt his awareness by conforming to Zeus’s demands would be to extinguish the light that he had brought to earth. In this respect, Prometheus’s intellectual hon- esty— a virtue—is the quality that occasions his suffering."},{"pageNumber":598,"pageContent":"570 Myths of the Tragic Heroes and Heroines FIGURE 14-4 Atlas and Prometheus. The brutality with which Zeus enforces his rule is vividly rendered in this archaic Spartan cup depicting two Titan brothers (c. 555 B.C.). The giant Atlas endures back-breaking pain, his shoulders bent against the weight of the heavenly vault he is condemned forever to support. Facing him while suffering even worse agony is Prometheus, whose flesh is being ripped by the beak and talons of Zeus’s hungry eagle. Aes- chylus’s Prometheus can escape this repeated vivisection if he submits to Zeus’s authority, an option he rejects because it means assenting to his oppressor’s right to enslave bodies and control minds. (Vatican Museum, Rome) lo: A Victim of Zeus s Despotism Two important scenes help convey Aeschylus’s purpose in his startling reinterpreta- tion of the Prometheus myth. The first introduces lo, a young woman driven almost insane by a stinging gadfly that Flera jealously sends to plague her. Unlike Prome- theus, who has deliberately disobeyed Zeus, lo is merely an innocent victim of the despot’s lust. lo’s case illustrates the fate of vulnerable humanity when no law exists to restrain a despot’s whim. Fler appearance near the middle of the play is particularly damning to the Olympian ruler: the bully who raped her is too cowardly to protect lo from his wife’s irrational fury. Both the King and Queen of Fdeaven are chillingly indifferent to the suffering they cause. In the climactic episode, Fdermes, portrayed as the swaggering emissary of a mili- tary junta, appears to announce the torments that Zeus will soon inflict on Prome- theus.

Wisest of the centaurs, Chiron instructs the young Achilles in playing the lyre. A son of Cronus and Philyra, daughter of Ocean, Chiron belongs to the gen- eration of Zeus. He is famous for his kindness to humans, helping to bring up such heroes as Jason and Ascle- pius. According to Apollodorus, when Aeschylus states that Prometheus must suffer until another god is will- ing to die for him, he refers to Chi- ron, who was accidentally struck by one of Heracles’ arrows, which in- flicted incurable wounds. Unable to bear unending pain, Chiron gives his immortality to Prometheus (who in Apollodorus’s version of the myth was apparently born mortal), thus provid- ing a vicarious atonement for the Ti- tan. Zeus then places Chiron in the sky as the constellation Centaurus. (National Museum, Naples) resistance, now reject Hermes’ advice to abandon the Titan. The chorus, which typically voices a mediating position between the two tragic extremes of battling op- ponents, unanimously decides to take Prometheus’s side, even if it means sharing his punishment. Led by the chorus’s example, the audience is confronted with a choice between seemingly irresistible power and helpless principle and is asked to opt for the latter. The Secret: Only Prometheus Can Save Zeus In Aeschylus’s ironic vision, Prometheus’s defiance of Zeus’s injustice gives the Olym- pian an opportunity to save himself from the fate of his predecessors, Uranus and Cronus. Prometheus alone knows the cause of Zeus’s future downfall—that the Olympian’s sexual energy will drive him to beget (by the sea nymph Thetis) a son strong enough to displace him (see Chapter 11). In the lost plays, Prometheus vol- untarily confides this secret to Zeus, rescuing the god from destruction by his own untamed impulses. In his turn, as Hermes prophesies, Prometheus will benefit from the redemptive act of a god willing to die for him. Although Aeschylus does not identify the deity who will sacrifice himself for Prometheus, Apollodorus states that this expiatory role is filled by the centaur Chiron (Figure l4-5). According to Apollodorus, when he is wounded by one of Heracles’ poisoned arrows, Chiron suffers such exquisite agony that he is eager to die, and in perishing he somehow bestows his immortality on Prometheus. Because the Titan is already immortal, however, it is difficult to see how Chiron’s vicarious sacrifice can benefit him. As Mark Griffith suggests, Hermes’"},{"pageNumber":600,"pageContent":"572 Myths of the Tragic Heroes and Heroines prophecy may refer to either Chiron or Heracles, who not only frees Prometheus but also, as his final “labor,” descends into Death’s realm to fetch Cerberus (see Chap- ters 9 and 10). Although Zeus finally accepts Prometheus among the Olympian immortals, one tradition states that, because he had sworn by the River Styx (a symbol of the gods’ unbreakable oaths) that the Titan would never be released from his rock, Zeus forces Prometheus to wear a steel ring to which a fragment of the rock is attached.

In the final play, which pits chthonic forces (the Furies) against the Olympian sky gods, Athene intervenes in Orestes flight to me- diate between the ancient principles of blood vengeance and new laws of civic order. Aeschylus Drama of Crime and Redemption The only surviving Greek trilogy, Aeschylus’s Oresteia was first produced in 458 B.C., two years before the playwright’s death. A sweeping reinterpretation of Homeric myth, the three plays examine the causes and consequences of Agamemnon’s murder by his wife, Clytemnestra, and the unbearable dilemma facing their son, Orestes, who is compelled to kill his own mother in order to avenge his father’s death. Al- though Aeschylus inherited his characters and dramatic situation from Homer, he turned this domestic tragedy of adultery and matricide into a cosmic event: Orestes, after whom the trilogy is named, affords the gods an opportunity to redefine the nature of justice and establish a new concept of divinity that transforms both religion and Greek society. The playwright’s major concern is the force of evolutionary change, in both the human and divine spheres, that ultimately unites contrarieties and mediates a bipolar view of existence. Incorporating a dominant theme of the Prometheus trilogy, Aes- chylus explores the implications of the Greek belief that gods are not eternal and unchanging but, like human beings, are born, grow, and attain ethical maturity only 600"},{"pageNumber":629,"pageContent":"The House of Atreus 601 with the slow passing of time. Time eventually heals the breach between Zeus and Prometheus, ultimately merging the Titan’s superior wisdom and compassion with Zeus’s Olympian administration. In the Oresteia, Aeschylus shows the influence on human society of Zeus’s moral evolution, a process that reaches its climax in the Eumenides the hostile spirits of blood vengeance (the Erinyes [e-RIN-ih-eez], or Furies) are transformed into benign protectors and sources of blessing for Athene’s people. By the Eumenides conclusion, we realize that Agamemnon’s murder and his son’s revenge are primarily an opportunity for a divinely guided legal and moral revo- lution: acts of personal barbarism (the vendetta) are replaced by courts of law that recognize and enforce the civilized values of clemency. Aeschylus and the Athenian Democracy For Aeschylus, the ancient myth of Agamemnon’s doomed house—its crimes, pun- ishments, and ultimate regeneration—serves to make a powerful statement about the Athenian democracy. In dramatizing the tale of Agamemnon’s murder and his son’s unspeakable revenge, Aeschylus focuses on the story’s outcome: the gods’ ability to redeem the effects of sin and guilt through the institution of democratic procedures, particularly courts of law in which juries composed of free citizens, each with a single vote, evaluate difficult questions of justice. Working together as a cooperative body of equals, the Athenian jurors share power in wrestling with issues of life and death— all under the benign direction of Athene, who emphasizes that no one person—not even so exalted a personage as an Olympian goddess—has the right to make unilat- eral decisions. This is too grave a case for mortal minds, Nor is it right that I [Athene] should judge an act Of blood shed with such bitter consequences. Only the community acting as a whole, encompassing both its divine and human components, can resolve the ethical complexities with which Orestes’ crime con- fronts the polis. In the end, Athene pointedly credits “Zeus of the assembly” (the democracy’s governing body) for having won the day, ushering her people into a higher stage of civilization. An Overview In his Poetics, the earliest extant discussion of Greek epic and tragedy, Aristotle (384 — 322 B.c.) described the well-made drama as having a single major action, without distracting subplots. He added that the time covered in the play’s events should be confined to “one revolution of the sun,” a 24-hour period, so that the temporal duration of events on stage generally corresponded to the audience’s sense of real time. Later critics of the Renaissance and Enlightenment interpreted Aristotle’s de- scriptive comments as formal prescriptions for the “three unities” of time, place, and action, imposing formal restrictions that supposedly intensify a drama’s tragic effect. Conceived on a grand scale perhaps never surpassed in world theater, the Ores-"},{"pageNumber":630,"pageContent":"602 Myths of the Tragic Heroes and Heroines Thermopylae • PHOCIS ife,.. • ■ , A Mr. Parnassus EUBOEA ' ..

The area of Greece south of the Gulf of Corinth is called the Peloponnesus, named after Pelops, son of Tantalus. During the Mycenaean period (c. 1600-1100 B.C.), this area was dominated by heavily fortified cities such as Mycenae, Sparta, Tiryns, and Pylos, all of which figure prominently in Greek my- thology. Although Mycenae is historically the site of Agamemnon’s capital, Aeschylus trans- ferred it to Argos, the setting of his Agamemnon and Libation-Bearers. teia — written more than a century before Aristotle’s Poetics —boldly ignores any con- fines of time or place. Aeschylus gave his trilogy an epic scope, covering events that span at least a decade and setting the action all over Greece. The first play, the Aga- memnon, opens in Argos (rather than nearby Mycenae, the historically correct site) shortly before Agamemnon’s return home from Troy. The second play, Choephoroe (Libation-Bearers) takes place several years later, after Orestes has grown to young manhood and returned from exile. In the third play, the Eumenides, the scene shifts from the Peloponnesian peninsula to Delphi, where Orestes, pursued by the Furies, seeks purification. For the final act, after another year has passed, Aeschylus transfers the action to Athens, where Orestes is tried before a specially convened tribunal on the Areopagus (Flill of Ares), a rocky spur of the Acropolis. (See Figure 15-1 for an overview of the geographic area covered in the Oresteia.) The original issues of blood vengeance and filial duty that dominate in Argos become in Athens matters of civic law and religious ethics.

In this vase painting, Menelaus, who has reclaimed Helen after the fall of Troy, threatens her with his sword. Although the Odyssey portrayed Helen respectfully, restoring her to Sparta with queenly rank and privileges, other Greek myths reported that Menelaus executed the woman who had betrayed him for Paris (whereas still others insisted that only a phantom Helen had eloped to Troy). Clytemnestra, who is married to Menelaus s brother, resembles her sister, Helen, in being an equally unfaithful wife, but far more deadly. (British Museum, London) witness for the defense, and Athene as judge. The Oresteia reaches its climax not in Orestes’ acquittal and absolution but in Athene’s transformation of the Furies (Erinyes) into the Kindly Ones (Eumenides), thus fulfilling Zeus’s plan. As a coda to the tragic action, Aeschylus created a satyr play based on an epi- sode in the Odyssey: Menelaus’s comic encounter with Proteus, a sea god who has the Dionysian ability to change into any form he desires. The play has been lost, but it probably involved a farcical version of the Homeric account, with Proteus metamorphosing himself successively into a lion, a serpent, a panther, a boar, a body of water, and a tree. If Aeschylus followed Homer’s account, we may suppose that the play featured this sequence of incidents: after a satiric agon (the contest or struggle featured in tragedy), Menelaus at last forces Proteus to use his prophetic gifts to foretell the Greek leader’s successful return—with the now repentant Helen — to Sparta. Offering a pleasurable contrast to Agamemnon’s bloody home- coming, Menelaus’s adventure concludes the Dionysian tragic cycle by sexually re- uniting the couple whose marital problems helped precipitate the Trojan War.

Important Elements and Themes The Choruses The Oresteids three very different choruses are integral parts of Aes- chylus’s design. The Agamemnon chorus is composed of Argive citizens who, even ten years before the play opens, were too old to fight at Troy and are now reduced to the status of passive onlookers. Feebly protesting Clytemnestra’s take-charge attitude, they fail to perceive her homicidal intentions, even when Cassandra, a clairvoyant Trojan princess, explicitly describes her visions of Agamemnon’s imminent death. Although physically impotent and unequal to the challenge of their queen’s con- spiracy, the chorus is a rich repository of traditional wisdom and religious insight. The first choral ode sounds two of Aeschylus’s principal themes: that wisdom is won only through suffering and that the integrity of Zeus, the supreme god, ensures that universal moral order will ultimately prevail. Both the second and third parts of the Oresteia are named after their respective choruses. The Libation-Bearers are captive Trojan women whom Clytemnestra orders to carry ritual drink offerings (libations) to the tomb of Agamemnon, whose ghost now troubles his widow’s dreams. The enslaved women embody a typically Aeschy- lean paradox: although they have lost husbands, families, and homeland through Agamemnon’s conquest of Troy, they are united in honoring their slain captor and hating his arrogant queen. Their cry of triumph over the regicides’ dead bodies echoes Clytemnestra’s joyous shout in the Agamemnon when she first learns of her husband’s approach and anticipates the glad cries accompanying the Eumenides’ ritual proces- sion that concludes the trilogy. In the third play, the Eumenides, the chorus consists of Furies (Erinyes), savage spirits of vengeance whom Athene will eventually domesticate as the Eumenides (oo- MEN-ih-deez), or “Kindly Ones.” They first appear at the end of the Libation-Bearers when, as Gorgon-like horrors, they rush on stage to seize Orestes, determined to destroy the matricide in both body and soul. In Aeschylus’s vision of the gods’ evo- lution, the Furies represent ancient chthonic (earth-oriented) powers who oppose the new ouranic (sky-god) deities of Olympus. According to Hesiod, they were generated from drops of blood falling on Gaea from Uranus’s severed genitals and are thus both earthborn and the product of castration, a primordial crime against the father. De- spite their differences in appearance and function, they are half-sisters of Aphrodite, who was also created from Uranus’s mutilation, and thus aspects of the Great God- dess. Commensurate with their origin, the Furies punish crimes against blood kin, especially of children against their parents. Aeschylus makes them daughters of Night (Nyx), sister of Erebus (Infernal Darkness), perhaps because this ancestry emphasizes their natural opposition to Apollo, the luminous eye of heaven. The Curse on the House of Atreus To illustrate his view that the gods are de- termined to end wanton bloodshed and expunge even the deepest guilt, Aeschylus examines one of the most spectacularly dysfunctional families in all of Greek my- thology. The royal House (dynasty) of Atreus [AY-tre-uhs] (see Eigure 15-3), father of Agamemnon and Menelaus, inherits a proclivity toward evil from a distant ances- tor, Tantalus, the man who murdered and cooked his own son, serving Pelops’s dis-"},{"pageNumber":633,"pageContent":"The House of Atreus 605 Tantalus Pelops Thyestes Atreus Leda = Tyndareus (or Zeus) son son Aegisthus Agamemnon Menelaus = Helen Clytemnestra Castor Polydeuces Clytemnestra Agamemnon Iphigenia Chrysothemis Electra Orestes FIGURE 15-3 Genealogy of the House of Atreus, As this genealogical chart indicates, Aga- memnon and his family are descended from a long line of royal criminals, including perpetra- tors of murder, adultery, incest, and cannibalism.

Although the Tantalus myth may function primarily to warn against human sacrifice—the Olym- pians summarily reject Tantalus’s offering and condemn him to Tartarus—it antici- pates the equally vile crime of Atreus himself. Atreus and his brother Thyestes engage in a bitter feud after the latter commits adultery with Atreus’s wife, Aerope. Pretend- ing a reconciliation, Atreus invites Thyestes to a banquet, where his unsuspecting brother dines on the flesh of his sons. Although Aeschylus does not use it, one version of the Atreus myth emphasizes the incestuous origin of Thyestes’ son Aegisthus, who avenges the wrongs done to his side of the family. After an oracle decrees that only a son conceived in incest could effect the desired revenge, Thyestes impregnates his daughter, Pelopia, who gives birth to Aegisthus. In this tradition, Aegisthus grows up to kill his uncle Atreus, become Clytemnestra’s lover, and murder Agamemnon. The Sacrifice of Iphigenia Before leaving Argos for Troy, Agamemnon, acting on a dubious prophetic oracle, compounds the family sins by sacrificing his daughter Iphigenia [if-ih-je-NYE-a], Clytemnestra’s favorite child (Figure 15-4). In the Aga- memnon, the chorus implies that Argos’s king slaughtered his virgin daughter because of egoism—he feared the public shame involved in disbanding his army. Other poets assigned Agamemnon different motives, with some ascribing Iphigenia’s murder to her father’s ambition. When the unruly Greek army, assembled at the seaport of Aulis, threatens to disperse because the gods withhold fair sailing winds, threatening to rob Agamemnon of his major chance at glory, he exchanges his child in return for"},{"pageNumber":634,"pageContent":"606 Myths of the Tragic Heroes and Heroines FIGURE 15-4 The Sacrifice of Iphigenia. For Iphigenia’s mother, Agamemnon’s sin in sac- rihcing their daughter is unforgivable. Clytemnestra sees herself as fully justihed in avenging her child by killing the murderer, who is also her husband and king, an act that perpetuates the curse on the House of Atreus. In this Roman wall painting (c. A.D. 63-79) of Iphigenia at Aulis, the port from which the Greek fleet under Agamemnon’s command departed for Troy, a veiled figure hides her face in grief while in the sky above Artemis rides a stag to res- cue the girl, a version of the myth absent in Aeschylus’s trilogy but dramatized by Euripides (see the box on pp. 684—685).

In his Iphigenia at Aulis, Euripides examines the pres- sures that Agamemnon’s soldiers, eager to seize Troy’s gold, impose on their com- mander, making him the pawn of their collective greed and blood lust. Cassandra’s Prophecy When Troy falls, Agamemnon adds to his guilt by desecrat- ing the city’s holy shrines and massacring even those who seek asylum in the gods’ sanctuaries. In his treatment of the myth, Aeschylus implies Agamemnon’s impiety by showing the conqueror bringing home Cassandra, a virgin priestess of Apollo, whom he has violated and enslaved as his concubine. A daughter of Priam and Hecuba, Cassandra bears a heavy burden: she is a prophet who foresees the future"},{"pageNumber":635,"pageContent":"The House ofAtreus 607 FIGURE 15-5 Apollo and Cassandra [or a Muse]. If this vase painting depicts Apollo offer- ing himself to Cassandra, a princess of Troy and the god’s virgin priestess, it evokes the source of Cassandra’s conflicted role in the Agamemnon. According to one tradition, Cassandra at first consents to the god’s wish to sleep with her but later refuses to make love, attempting to retain both her religious office and her independence. Although he cannot rescind his pro- phetic gift, the rejected Apollo takes away Cassandra’s credibility so that no one will ever be- lieve her predictions. Tormented by her knowledge of the future and her powerlessness to make others accept her vision, Cassandra appears in the Agamemnon as a demented clairvoy- ant, possessed by a god’s spirit but unable to warn others or save herself.

This intensely frustrating predicament results from Cassandra’s wish to protect her virginity, a symbol of her integrity and commitment to her prophetic office, even from the god who endowed her with clairvoyance. When Apollo attempted to seduce her, Cassandra rebuffed him: the Delphic god could not retract his gift, but he cursed her with an undeserved inability to make others understand her visions (Figure 15-5).

Betrayed by her god, exploited by Agamemnon, and slaughtered by his wife, Cassandra is a victim of bru- tality both human and divine. Even the chorus, which is generally sympathetic to her plight, seems willfully blind to her warnings of impending disaster. In death, as in life, she is utterly alone, trapped in her solitary, unwanted vision. The Agamemnon With its long choral songs and stately pace, the Agamemnon moves slowly but inexo- rably toward a powerful confrontation between Greece’s victorious commander in chief and the wife who has ruled Argos in his absence. While Agamemnon remains outside the palace in his war chariot, with a procession of soldiers, captives, and booty in his train, Clytemnestra occupies the high ground of the ceremonial steps that she will force her husband to ascend in a way that offends the gods and marks his doom. The agon (struggle) between husband and wife is no contest: Clytemnestra, superior in intelligence and will, knows how to bend Agamemnon to her purpose, goading his vanity until he accepts her dare to walk up the steps she has covered with priceless carpets. Persuading Agamemnon publicly to commit hubris—a prideful act that elic- its divine retribution—she manipulates him into taking on himself an honor re- served only for gods: a conquering hero, he treads the crimson runner, a blood-red path leading to the palace interior. Delighted that Agamemnon has escaped the dangers of war so that she can have the pleasure of killing him herself, Clytemnestra impales her husband on Aegisthus’s sword, transforming his bath into a bloody sea (Figure 15-6). Carrying her gore- stained weapon as she emerges from the palace, Clytemnestra takes full credit for the regicide, for she sees herself as heaven’s instrument of justice, the executioner of her daughter’s killer. Acting alone, Clytemnestra struck her husband, humiliating him with her “woman’s hand.” Aegisthus, who later snarls loudly at the disapproving cho- rus, is little more than the queen’s lapdog. Grieving for Iphigenia as Demeter had for Persephone, Clytemnestra seems to champion women’s rights, taking vengeance against a male ruler who had sacrificed his daughter to further his political ambitions. Clytemnestra, however, does not manifest feminine solidarity as such, but only so far as there exists a blood tie between females, particularly mother and a favored daughter. Even in this human bond, how- ever, Clytemnestra is deficient. While she fixates on Iphigenia and her fate, Clytem- nestra shows little affection for her younger daughter, Electra, of whom she would be glad to dispose. She also has no compunction about hacking Cassandra to death with an ax (Figure 15-7), although the Trojan woman is clearly an unwilling victim of male brutality. Like Hera, Clytemnestra regards her husband’s mistresses not as members of an exploited sisterhood but solely as affronts to her pride, rivals she can exterminate without a qualm.

As Orestes observes after slaying his mother, such a woman cannot be trusted. Aeschylus struggles with this issue, not altogether satisfac- torily to some modern critics, throughout the Oresteia. The Libation-Bearers Orestes, weeping alone at his father’s neglected tomb, opens the Libation-Bearers with a brief prologue invoking Hermes, guide of the dead. Disguised as a traveling peddler because he knows that his mother would kill him in a minute to ensure her own safety, Orestes prepares to face the contradictory divine forces that push him to the brink of insanity.

As the victim of a powerful king’s lust and his wife’s savage jealousy, Cassandra resembles the mythic objects of Zeus’s unwanted affection, such as lo or Leda.

As Apollo’s human servant, a furtive agent sent to cleanse his homeland of evil, Orestes does not hesitate to kill Aegisthus (Fig- ure 15-8) but almost fails to complete the act that fulfills his duty to Agamemnon. At the crucial moment when Orestes seems unable to strike Clytemnestra, his com- panion Pylades [PYE-la-deez] —who dogs his friend’s footsteps throughout the play but speaks only on this occasion — repeats Apollo’s command: the gods give Orestes no freedom to choose. Obediently, he kills his mother (Figure 15-9) and is immedi- ately besieged by fiends. Aeschylus emphasizes that no one except Orestes can see the Furies. The chorus, to whom they are invisible, is baffled by Orestes’ anguish, a suggestion that, in this scene, Aeschylus presents the Furies as hallucinatory, psychological projections of the mother-slayer’s overpowering guilt.

Although Orestes’ hand is occupied driving his sword through Aegisthus, his eyes are already fixed on his next victim, his mother. Clytemnestra’s attempted flight (left) will soon be cut short by her son’s avenging blade. (Ku nsthisto risches Museu m, Vien na) Apollo founded his oracle, a succession of earth goddesses presided there, including Themis and Phoebe, the “shining one,” a daughter of Gaea and Uranus. The change from a chthonic to a ouranic cult foreshadows the play’s climactic reversal: in the public arena of Orestes’ trial, where gods of earth and sky contend for supremacy, the Olympians will gain universal control. In the trial scene, binary tensions building throughout the trilogy gather in sharp focus: male is pitted against female, innovation against ancient tradition, intellect against emotion, the rule of law against individual excess, and civilization against barbarism. Presenting the world as divided between two polar opposites, Aeschylus’s impassioned characters identify its most savage components with the female prin- ciple, associating the Furies with cruelty, darkness, death, and slaughter, whereas Apollo, the quintessential male figure, is seen as allied with clemency, purity, light, health, rationality, and moderation (Figure 15-10)."},{"pageNumber":641,"pageContent":"The Ho use of A treus 613 FIGURE 15-10 Orestes Clinging to the Omphalos at Delphi. In this dramatic painting of a scene from the Eumenides, Apollo extends his right arm to banish the Furies from his sanctu- ary as his suppliant Orestes clutches the sacred “navel” stone, imploring the god to protect him. As the divine administrator of purification rites, Apollo cleanses Orestes of ritual guilt for having killed his mother, Clytemnestra; but only Athene’s court of justice can legally ab- solve him of the crime and permanently deliver him from the vengeful Furies. Although she does not appear in the Oresteia, the figure at the right, holding a bow and accompanied by a hunting dog, may be Artemis, who shares her brother’s loathing for the Furies. (National Museum, Naples) The characters’ assault against the negative shadow of the Great Goddess reaches a peak when, in a burst of misogyny, Apollo claims that the mother is not a real parent but merely the “nurse” or incubator of the seed that the father deposits in her. Phoebus cites Athene as the casebook example of a father’s ability to produce children without female aid, a mythic allusion that serves primarily to endorse the Athenian patriarchy: in terms of legal and social practice, only the male has genuine parental status. Apollo’s reference to Athene’s motherless birth also functions symbolically to as- sociate her, as rational consciousness and civilization, with the male principle. By contrast, the Furies—unconscious instinct and savage nature—are seen as Athene’s polar opposite, a devouring feminine appetite for blood. Although Athene does not explicitly endorse Apollo’s argument, she unequivocally sides with male authority. Declaring that she cannot support the cause of a woman who kills her husband, Athene casts the deciding vote for Orestes’ acquittal (Fig- ure 15-11). (The jurors had reached a deadlock on the defendant’s guilt; a vote evenly divided was equivalent to a not-guilty verdict.) Many critics have traditionally as- sumed that Apollo and Athene prefer mercy to strict justice and are concerned with establishing the legal principle of extenuating circumstances (in Orestes’ case, the oracle’s command) in exonerating a defendant. Aeschylus’s text, however, mentions neither compassion nor legal rationales."},{"pageNumber":642,"pageContent":"614 Myths of the Tragic Heroes and Heroines FIGURE 15-11 Athene. Extending her hand as if in appeal, this bronze Athene could well represent the goddess in her role at Orestes’ trial before the Areopagus. Act- ing as mediator between Apollonian con- cern for masculine authority and the Furies’ passion to avenge matricide, Athene uses the rhetorical arts of persuasion to tame chthonic energy and bring it into the ser- vice of her city-state. Fulfilling the will of Zeus, the sky gods succeed in establishing a new concept of civil justice, but the primi- tive fear of punishment for wrongdoing re- mains an integral part of the Greek experi- ence. Accepting Athene’s invitation to inhabit an underground grotto beneath the sunlit Acropolis, the Eumenides (Kindly Ones) remain a potent, unseen force—an- cient promoters of the vendetta ironically transformed into inhibitors of future vio- lence. (National Museum, Athens) Orestes’ victory (Figure 15-12) is necessary for Aeschylus to move on to his pri- mary interest—Athene’s use of persuasion to change the hostile Furies into a force for human good. Behaving as a divine exemplar of democratic principles, at the cli- max of the trial scene Athene employs rational argument to reconcile opposing fac- tions. Like many leaders of the Athenian decmocracy, Athene must mediate between time-honored traditions beloved by many and political innovations that will radically change life in the polis. Alluding only briefly to her power to coerce—she has access to Zeus’s thunderbolts—Athene prefers to offer civic honors and other benefits to the Furies, gradually making them realize the advantages of democratic compromise. Realizing that enemies can be changed into supporters only if they willingly agree to abandon their old allegiances, Athene persists in enumerating the benefits that will accrue to the Furies if they cooperate. By cultivating in the Furies a new awareness of their true self-interest, a recognition that turns bitter foes into helpful friends, Athene demonstrates the inestimable value of persuasive speech in the democratic process.

Mythic events that took place before the action of Aeschylus’s Agamemnon typically emphasize father-son and brother-brother conflict, usually involving murder and revenge. Agamemnon’s ancestor, Tantalus, kills his son, Pelops, and attempts to feed his flesh to the Olympian gods—an act that con- demns him to eternal torment in Tartarus. Tantalus’s descendants, Atreus and Thyestes, engage in a fraternal rivalry that culminates in Atreus’s murder of Thyes- tes’ sons and the cannibalistic banquet in which Thyestes unwittingly devours his children’s flesh. In the Homeric version of the subsequent conflict between the son of Atreus (Agamemnon) and the son of Thyestes (Aegisthus), it is Aegisthus, presumably acting alone, who kills Agamemnon. In Aeschylus’s tragedy, however, it is Clytem- nestra who boasts that her husband is slain by her own hand, thereby setting the stage for an intense struggle involving the respective rights and authority of a strong woman pitted against a less effectual man (who is also a head of state). Aeschylus’s dramatization of the struggle reaches a climax in the trial scene of the Eumenides, in which virtually all the principal characters in the Oresteia are depicted as polar opposites. Aeschylus’s resolution of the battle between old and new, male and fe- male, anarchy and order utilizes the powerful image of Athene, who shares qualities with both sides of the conflict and successfully mediates between them. Aeschylus’s dramatic use of ancient myth to illustrate the reconciliation of opposing forces in Greek society (and the human psyche) lends itself to a structuralist interpretation of the drama. division that gradually evolved into the reconciliation and union of a previously bi- furcated godhead. In the Oresteia, Aeschylus also presents two opposing aspects of divinity—the Furies and the Olympians—merging into a harmonious whole. For Aeschylus, there is no question of banishing the Furies or imprisoning them in Tar- tarus, as Zeus had done with the deposed Titans. (As they correctly observe, they function as single-minded detectives and executioners, in effect doing Zeus’s dirty work for him.) Instead, Aeschylus uses a metaphor of the democratic process—the rhetorical art of persuasion by which political opponents can rationally settle their differences—to achieve a workable union between the divine anger that penalizes evil and the divine goodwill that heals and redeems. Apollo, who leaves the stage immediately after the jury’s verdict, cannot mediate the issues because, as god of beauty and purification, he has no common ground with the Furies, whom he sees only as filthy hags bespattered with gore from tortures and executions. Athene functions as mediator because she, like the daughters of Night, is also a female deity (although born of a male) and possesses both chthonic perception"},{"pageNumber":645,"pageContent":"The House of Atreus 617 II Traditions and Qualities Associated with the Feminine Principle: Clytemnestra—“powerful female who avenges wrongs Iphigenia--^innocent girl sacriiced to male ambition The Furies—Nights daughters, spirits of blood vengeance, identified with darkness, violence, torture, blood- shed, castration, punishment, instinct, hatredj fear, irrationality, anarchy, in- flexible justice, and age-old tradition \\ Traditions and Qualities Associated with the Masculine Principle: Agamemnon—rightful king and father, treacherously murdered Orestes—^compelled by divine com- mand to avenge his father Apollo-—immortal son of Zeus, identi- fied with light, peace, spiritual insight, mental and physical health, masculine autonomy, ethical purification, modera- tion, restraint, rationality, stable order, clemency, and divine innovation m . .

By the end of his three-part drama, Aeschylus has clearly demonstrated his conviction that the an- cient Mycenaean legacy has evolved into a new concept of social justice that finds completion and fulfillment in the Athenian court of law. For Aeschylus and his audience, Athens—with its democracy guided by the Zeus-born embodiment of divine wisdom—is the culmination and ultimate achievement of Greek historical development. (from Metis) and ouranic wisdom (from Zeus). Her success in changing potential destroyers of the state into benign guardians fulfills the will of Zeus and unites Dio- nysian energy with Apollonian intelligence. Transformed into the Eumenides (Kindly Ones), these night terrors act as a sta- bilizing influence in human society, inspiring a useful fear that prohibits wrong- doing— a repressive function that Athene explicitly approves—and simultaneously conferring the chthonic blessing of fertility. The Eumenides’ torch-lit installation in a subterranean grotto beneath the Acropolis is an appropriate analogue to their Dio- nysian presence in the human unconscious, where their instinctual energy comple- ments Apollo’s rational intellect. A few years after the Oresteids premiere, Athene’s new temple, the Parthenon, was built atop the Acropolis, a gleaming symbol of the polis’s collective awareness.

Other poets, however, wrote extensively of Orestes’ subsequent adventures, in several cases adapting the myths in a way that settles old scores involving Agamemnon and the Trojan War. In Euripides’ play Iphigenia in Tauris, when Orestes asks Apollo how to rid himself of the madness that (in spite of the Furies’ domestication) still plagues him, the god directs him to Tauris (in modern Turkey), where he is to find and retrieve an ancient statue of Artemis. When Orestes and Pylades (Figure 15-13) arrive in Tauris, they are immediately imprisoned, for it is the local custom to sacrifice all strangers to their goddess. Brought before the high priestess of Artemis (Figure 15- 14), the two captives discover that she is none other than Orestes’ sister Iphigenia, whom the goddess had spirited away at the moment the priest at Aulis was about to cut her throat. Reunited, the two siblings carry off Artemis’s statue and, with Pylades, attempt to escape by ship. As Thoas, king of the region, is about to capture FIGURE 15-13 Orestes and Pylades. Orestes’ con- stant companion, Pylades is the son of Strophius, king of Phocis, and his wife, An- axibia, sister of Agamem- non. Because he speaks only once in the Oresteia, his single line—to remem- ber Apollo’s command— has compelling force. After accompanying Orestes on his wanderings, Pylades eventually marries his friend’s sister Electra. This marble group expresses the quality of heroic friendship that characterizes their myth. (Louvre, Paris)"},{"pageNumber":713,"pageContent":"The House ofAtreus 685 FIGURE 15-14 Artemis. Just as her brother Apollo plays a major role in promot- ing Orestes’ filial duty in avenging his male parent, so Artemis figures prominently in the life of Agamemnon’s virgin daughter, Iphige- nia. Abhorring human sacrifice, Artemis (in one version of the story) intervenes at the moment Iphigenia is about to be killed, spir- iting the girl away and leaving a deer in her place. In Euripides’ Iphigenia in TaurU, the goddess installs Iphigenia as her priestess among a barbarian tribe (the Tauri), where custom demands that all strangers be sacri- ficeid. Artemis manipulates events so that Iphigenia, Orestes, and Pylades escape to their homeland. This Roman work, known ^ Diana ofVersaiUes {^os$ih\\y copied from a Greek original), shows the goddess in her paradoxical function as both protector of wild creatures, such as the deer she shields with her left hand, and patron of the hunt, pictured by the arrows she draws from a quiver with her right hand. (Louvre, Paris) them, Athene suddenly appears to effect their safe return to Greece, where they build a temple to Artemis in Attica. Other episodes in the Orestes myth deal with his marriage and return to Argos. When Orestes was still an infant, Agamemnon had engaged his son to Hermione, daughter of Helen and Menelaus, but, at Troy, Menelaus broke his word and mar- ried the girl instead to Neoptolemus (Pyrrhus), the only son of Achilles. After re- turning from Tauris, the adult Orestes visits Hermione at Sparta while Neoptole- mus is at Delphi consulting the Oracle. Reenacting the elopement of Helen and Paris, Orestes abducts Hermione, taking her to Delphi, where, on her advice, he arranges Neoptolemus’s death by provoking a riot in which his rival is killed. In the fates of their respective sons, the old argument between Achilles and Agamemnon dramatized in the Iliads opening scenes is at last settled to the latter’s dynastic advantage. In the final part of his mythic cycle, Orestes eventually succeeds to the throne of both Argos and Sparta, uniting the kingdoms of Agamemnon and Menelaus. When a plague devastates Sparta, the Oracle states that the epidemic will abate only when the cities of Asia Minor destroyed in the Trojan War are rebuilt. Orestes accordingly founds new colonies on the sites of the ruined cities, restoring the shrines of their respective gods and thus ameliorating the divine displeasure that had cursed the Greeks for their violations of holy places during the war. The mur- derous violence that had afflicted the House of Atreus for generations ends with Orestes: myth grants the son of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra a reign of seventy years and a peaceful death at age ninety."},{"pageNumber":714,"pageContent":"686 Myths of the Tragic Heroes and Heroines Questions [or Discussion and Review 1.

What inspires Clytemnestra’s monumental hatred of her husband? How does Aeschylus present her side of the issue? Why does Aegisthus also seek revenge on Agamemnon? 3. Define Orestes’ dilemma in the Libation-Bearers. Do you think that Aeschylus’s origi- nal audience would agree that Orestes made the right choice in obeying Apollo’s com- mand? Why does the chorus side with Orestes and Electra, and why are its members unable to see the Furies when they appear to Orestes? 4.

His three plays on the myth of Oedipus have stimulated debate among critics from Aristotle’s time to the present. Oedipus Rex (which means “Oedipus the King, ” the Latin title of the play called Oedi- pus Tyrannus ) presents the hero in pursuit of the riddle of his identity. Oedi- pus, who thought he had long since escaped the fate decreed by the oracle, discovers that he has indeed killed his father and married his mother. The play is a complex study of the human psyche, with all its innermost secrets bared and its conflicting philosophical and metaphysical dimensions ex- plored. Oedipus at Colonus follows the story as Oedipus, at the end of his long exile, comes to the seat of the Eumenides and fulfills the “awful des- tiny” as prophesied. Antigone dramatizes the tragic story of Oedipus’s older daughter, who chooses to die rather than leave her traitorous brother Poly- neices’s body unburied. The World of Sophocles Born in approximately 496 B.C., Sophocles lived for ninety years through a remark- able century in the history of ancient Greece. The development of democracy; the rise of Athens to a position of political and cultural preeminence; the achievements of Greek artists, architects, writers, philosophers, and mathematicians—all contrib- uted to the sense of pride and the spirit of optimism that prevailed throughout what is commonly called the classical age of Greece. 687"},{"pageNumber":716,"pageContent":"688 Myths of the Tragic Heroes and Heroines The Athenian constitution had established what its citizens believed to be rational mechanisms for governing society, for preventing special-interest groups or indi- viduals from gaining too much power, and for procuring justice, as Aeschylus’s cele- bration of the jury system in his play the Eumenides attests. But even such careful planning could not prevent abuses within the system or external conflicts. The Pelo- ponnesian War between Sparta and Athens and their respective allies, which erupted in 431 B.C., shattered many illusions, as rival political and economic factions took advantage of the war-generated anxiety and confusion to expand their own positions and power. Just as the myths describe people turning to their heroes to protect them in times of crisis, so the Athenians turned to their generals, who sometimes served them well (as did Pericles [PER-ik-leez]) and sometimes betrayed them (as did the highly popular Alcibiades, who, rejected by a more conservative faction, sold out to the Spartans). But even before these unnerving events, the rapid pace of cultural changes led people to reexamine their traditional perspectives on human experience and the relationship of humans to the gods. Already, confldence in a rationally or- dered world was beginning to falter. In the work of playwrights like Sophocles, we can see those questions beginning to emerge, a slightly dissonant voice running in tense counterpoint to the upbeat public music of conventional attitudes and beliefs. It is at just such a transitional moment—when trust in the centrality of human ex- perience perseveres alongside a growing distrust in the commitment of the gods to act accordingly—that tragedy of the kind we witness in the Oedipus plays becomes especially relevant. Sophocles: The Gtizen and Writer Sophocles himself actively participated in the life, both political and artistic, of his time, serving in various elected offices and writing more than 125 plays, often in competition with his older contemporary Aeschylus and younger contemporary Eu- ripides. A highly successful playwright, he won first prize in the dramatic competition twenty times, and after his death a hero cult was founded in his name. Of Sophocles’ many plays, only seven have survived, among them the three plays on the family of Oedipus [E-dih-puhs]. Unlike Aeschylus’s Oresteian trilogy, the three plays were not written as a set and presented simultaneously—forty years separated the earliest {Antigone) from the last {Oedipus at Colonus). Nor were they written in chronological order: Antigone, the first of the three to be written, is the last in the narrative sequence, picking up the story of Antigone’s [an-TIG-oh-nee] defiance of her uncle, Creon [KREE-on], and her subsequent martyrdom. Her story is set in the aftermath of the civil war between Oedipus’s sons, Eteocles [e-TEE-oh-kleez] and Polyneices [pol-ih-NYE-seez], that followed the death of Oe- dipus, which is depicted in Sophocles’ last play, Oedipus at Colonus. And not only do the plot details, characterizations, and ideas and attitudes differ among the three, but the approach to tragedy as a mode of defining human experience changes from one play to the next."},{"pageNumber":717,"pageContent":"The Tragic House ofLaius 689 Oedipus Kex Perhaps no classical Greek play has stimulated as much critical discussion and debate, beginning with the philosopher Aristotle, as has Sophocles’ Oedipus Rex. The exact date of Oedipus Rex is uncertain, but most scholars place it between 429 and 425 B.C. Shortly before, in 430 B.C., plague had broken out in Athens, perhaps a result of overcrowding and stress on the sanitation systems when people, seeking safety during the Peloponnesian War, crowded into the city. The Athenian audience would have recognized the description of the plague in Thebes in the opening scene of the play as immediately relevant to their own contemporary experience. Psychological Dimensions The psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud argued that Oedipus Rex is relevant—to all audi- ences— for another reason as well. Every male child, Freud believed, unconsciously desires to kill his father and to marry his mother, being psychologically predeter- mined to have such desires simply because he is a human male. The Greek gods, of course, committed with impunity such acts as castrating a father or marrying a sister. Indeed, as many scholars have noted, Oedipus’ situation re-creates that of Gronus and Zeus, who castrate or make war on (that is, symbolically kill) their fathers and marry their sisters, who, in turn, take over the role of their respective mothers. For humans, however, these universally forbidden impulses must not be either openly expressed or even consciously acknowledged, and the resulting tension may give rise to a form of neurosis that Freud named, after Sophocles’ protagonist, the Oedipus complex (see Chapter 2). Whether Freud’s theories are universal or even valid, Soph- ocles and his audience clearly had a keen interest in human psychology. Indeed, many Greek tragedies are concerned with the violation of universal taboos against matricide, patricide, and incest. In Oedipus Rex, we find such impulses ad- dressed directly and the sources of such behavior explored. For example, Jocasta [joh-KAS-ta], Oedipus’s wife, seems to believe that appalling urges (such as those described by Freud) are common and that (also like Freud) they are revealed in dreams. Speaking of the desire to marry one’s mother, she tells Oedipus, “Many a man has dreamt as much.” Even more remarkable is her insistence, centuries before Ereud, on the necessity of the mechanism that Ereud would later call repression: “Such things must be forgotten,” she insists, “if life is to be endured.” But although Jocasta dismisses these impulses as insignificant, Freud saw them as determinants of the hu- man personality and compared Oedipus’s detective work—tracking down the secrets of his identity—to the psychoanalytic process of ferreting out and confronting the contents of the unconscious. In Oedipus Rex, two forms of the failure of knowledge—the people’s indifference to the identity of their king’s murderer and Oedipus’s ignorance of his own identity— produce illness, whether pathology (the plague) or what in other circumstances might appear to be psychosis (Oedipus’s acting out of the primal taboos). In both cases, Oedipus’s discovery of the truth has a cathartic effect: the plague is presumably over, and Oedipus has completed his excruciating voyage of self-discovery and achieved at last a state of wholeness not possible while the truth about himself lay hidden."},{"pageNumber":718,"pageContent":"690 Myths of the Tragic Heroes and Heroines Apollo and Fate In both cases, it is Apollo who calls attention through his oracle to the conditions that prevail: he reveals to Oedipus the initial prophecy regarding his parents and, later, the Thebans’ failure to find and punish the killer of their king. It is also Apollo, as the source of the oracle’s pronouncements, who is behind the original statements about what is usually called the fate of King Laius [LAY-uhs] and of Oedipus himself One of the important questions the play raises is whether Apollo, in articulating the “fate” of Oedipus, is decreeing what will happen to him no matter what actions he takes and what choices he makes or whether, as god of prophecy, he is simply foreseeing what actually turns out to happen to Oedipus as a result of his own free choices. That is, to what degree do the gods choose Oedipus’s destiny for him? To what degree is he in control of his own life? In modern terms, we might ask the same question in another way: does nature or nurture—that is, genetic makeup or training and experience—determine an individual’s behavior? Sophocles provides several clues that occur at the precise juncture of these two possible explanations of the events in Oedipus’s life, so that, no matter how we phrase the question, the answer remains tantalizingly ambiguous. Modern readers might also note that the oracle becomes a “self-fulfilling” prophecy: the mere fact of its revelation prompts Oedipus to leave his home and family in Corinth. Going out on the road to seek his fortune elsewhere, he will eventually encounter the man who will turn out to be his biological father, thus setting in motion the whole chain of catastrophic events. As a prophetic god, to what degree is Apollo “responsible” for the consequences of the oracle’s utterances? In the play, the first and most obvious signal that Apollo interferes with events in the lives of humans is the plague that has been visited on Thebes and its inhabitants. Punished by Apollo, god of health (and therefore of illness), for their negligence in the serious matter of regicide (the murder of a king), the people of Thebes are suffer- ing grievously. The oracle’s message, which would have been taken as seriously by the members of the Athenian audience as it was by the characters in the play, is that the plague will continue until the murderer is apprehended and exiled. And although the play does not explicitly refer to the lifting of the plague, that expectation is presum- ably fulfilled when Oedipus agrees to exile himself as Apollo demands. Other components of the play also seem to support the claim that fate controls human experience—the remarkable series of coincidences, for example. The more Oedipus tries to escape the path laid out for him by the oracle, the more he is trapped into fulfilling it: the man he kills at the crossroads turns out to be his father; the city that rewards him for solving the riddle of the Sphinx turns out to be his birthplace; the woman to whom he is married turns out to be his mother. Tiresias Another figure whose presence seems to validate the oracle’s authority is Tiresias [tih-REE-sih-as], prophet of Apollo. According to the myths, Tiresias was blinded by Hera (or possibly Athene) for seeing the goddess bathing—a view of the gods too intimate for mere mortals. He was also punished (for killing the female of a pair of copulating snakes he encountered) by being made to spend one year as a woman, after which he retained both male and female sexual characteristics. In another variant, when asked which gender enjoyed sex more, Tiresias angered Hera by replying that the woman had more pleasure. She punished him by blinding him."},{"pageNumber":719,"pageContent":"The Tragic House ofLaius 691 According to these myths, Zeus compensated Tiresias for his physical blindness by giving him the gift of inner sight, or prophetic vision. Blind to distracting surface appearances, Tiresias is also gifted with the wholeness of perspective that comes from a wider range of human experience than is available to mortals restricted to a single gender. In the earlier epics, as well as in the tragedies, Tiresias had long since become a symbol of wisdom and insight into the will of the gods. Nevertheless, the clear perception and open revelation of that will is fraught with danger to humans. The gods speak in riddles, while they themselves remain obscure and mysterious to us. Seeing a deity too close up, too clearly, in “natural,” undisguised or unmediated form brought death to the Theban princess Semele, who made love to Zeus, and to her nephew Actaeon, who observed the naked Artemis. Similarly, piercing the veil that hides the nature of the deities from human perception, and having the temerity to reveal what he saw, resulted in the blinding of Tiresias, who saw more of (or farther into) Hera than is permitted. The blinding of Oedipus, who likewise tries to rip the veil off the divine mysteries, is also, from the gods’ perspective, appropriate, if not inevitable: when Tiresias tells Oedipus, “To be wise is to suffer,” he knows whereof he speaks. Dismissing Tiresias’s warning, Oedipus, ever the rationalist, persists in his demand for clarity of vision, for a logical explanation of the mysteries of the gods. But to turn the light of human reason on the divine mysteries is to render oneself unable to see them. Thus, blinding himself to the mysteries of Dionysus, another Theban, Pentheus, was mutilated; Oe- dipus’s self-blinding is a variant on the sparagmos theme. Civic Responsibility For all the ways in which fate is operative in the world of the play, Sophocles strictly circumscribes its sphere of operations. For example, the myths about Oedipus’s family include references to a “curse” on the House of Labdacus, his grandfather. Such curses were presumed to be passed on from one generation to the next, until they were expiated to the gods’ satisfaction. Sophocles, however, never even alludes to such a possibility, apparently excluding inherited pollution as a rele- vant factor in Oedipus’s life. Further, within the context of the play itself, Apollo is not initially concerned with Oedipus’s violations of the primal taboos against patricide and incest. When the play opens, Oedipus has lived in Thebes for years, an honored leader, a beloved husband, a loving parent. The sin that has angered Apollo was committed not by Oedipus but by the people of Thebes. Long regarded as being rooted in violence since its legendary founder, Cadmus, sowed dragon’s teeth to create the city’s first inhabitants, a race of armed men (see Chapter 13), Thebes had a reputation—much like that of Italy as depicted in the plays of the European Renaissance—as a place where evil reigned, where any form of corruption was possible. Thebes was, further, an enemy to Athens, having taken the side of the Persians during the Persian Wars and even fighting the Athenians directly during the Peloponnesian War. The Athenian audience would undoubtedly have been gratified to watch as, in Sophocles’ portrayal, the Thebans were wrapped up in their own lives and engaged in a merely token investigation of the murder of their king while the perpetrator went unpunished. It is thus the people of Thebes— not Oedipus—who are punished by the plague. This is the message that Creon bears when he returns from the oracle: justice and civic health must be restored.

The vase painter depicts the shepherd bringing the infant Oedipus to the childless royal couple in Corinth. The child clings to his rescuer, whose evident compas- sion contrasts markedly with the cruelty of Oedipus’s biological parents. (Cabinet des Modailles, Paris) Apollo speak of blinding as the desired punishment for regicide; exile (the typical sentence imposed by Athens on offenders) is the punishment Apollo requires. Oedi- pus’s self-blinding is done by his own choice. Oedipus’s Character Sophocles not only sets limits to the scope of fate in the play but also provides for alternative explanations of the events surrounding Oedipus’s life. Although fate may provide one explanation for Oedipus’s leaving Corinth to go out on the road, where he will encounter his father, Laius, Oedipus’s character provides another. Laius thought he could control his destiny by taking preventive action. Thus, to prevent the prediction of his murder by his own son from being fulfilled, he had the child’s ankles pierced and bound (hence the name Oedipus, meaning “swollen foot”) and abandoned the child on a mountainside to die rather than accept responsibility for murdering his own son. How could he predict that the child would be rescued by a sympathetic shepherd and delivered to Corinth, to be adopted by the childless royal couple (Figure 16 - 1 ) ? Oedipus similarly chose to leave Corinth, believing that he could prevent the oracle’s fulfillment and evade the inevitable guilt. Both acts—in- tended to preempt the will of the gods and to avoid or change destiny—ironically help to bring it about. Thus, the son’s experience recapitulates the father’s. Both are bound up in the set of innate human responses long attested to in even the most"},{"pageNumber":721,"pageContent":"The Tragic House ofLaius 693 ancient of Greek myths of the creation and the generations of the gods, responses that produce rivalry and potential violence between fathers and sons and that express themselves in the typical “heroic,” ego-driven obsession with permanence, with the linear extension of the self through time. Father and son likewise make similar behavioral choices. Fate may or may not play a role in the extraordinary circumstances that place father and son at the crossroads at the same critical moment. But the more important question is, how do individuals respond to the circumstances in which they find themselves? In the case ofLaius and Oedipus, pride and anger surely determine what happens when their paths intersect. What but the massive egotism inherent in his pride in his status as king could prompt Laius to order passersby out of his way? What but pride could prompt Oedipus to refuse the request? And what but uncontrollable anger could drive Oedipus to kill an old man for what he perceives to be an insult? Oedipus may be in control of his rational decisions, but when angered, all re- straints disappear, and he repeatedly lashes out at whatever targets present them- selves— the old heroic impulse that prompts heroes to attack first and worry about the consequences later, as did Achilles and Hector. Thus, describing his encounter with Laius, Oedipus says, “Him I struck, for I was angry.” Compelled by similar emotional responses, he lashes out at Creon, who is trying to help him, and at Ti- resias, whom he himself has summoned, irrationally accusing both of crimes and conspiracies. Perhaps what Oedipus inherited from his father are not curses but per- sonality traits. The Importance of Riddles Further, no oracle speaks of Oedipus’s analytical intelligence—his extraordinary skill at solving riddles—or his courage in being willing even to confront the Sphinx, who had killed all previous challengers. Had Oedipus been less intelligent or courageous, his marriage with the now-widowed Jocasta—his reward for saving Thebes from the ravenous creature—could not have taken place. It is one of the play’s many riddles that his virtues themselves become sources of his unhappiness. As most readers have noted, riddles are central to the play in many ways. Behind the riddles in which Tiresias speaks and the riddle of Oedipus’s identity, the unravel- ing of which forms the plot of the play, lies the riddle of the Sphinx (Figure 16-2): what walks on four legs in the morning, two legs in the afternoon, and three legs in the evening? The answer, as Oedipus knew, to his own undoing, is “man,” or, as we would now state it, human beings, who crawl on all fours in infancy, walk upright throughout most of their lives, and lean on a cane in old age. Oedipus was satisfied that he knew the answer. But although he could solve the riddle by providing the correct word, like some kind of diabolical quiz show, and thus escape the fatal penalty, he failed to understand its significance. The riddle implies, first, that humans are all fated at least in the sense that they are all destined to lose control even over their own bodies as they age and eventually die: independence is a brief, transitory interval between the respective inadequacies of infancy and old age. The human will is free only in relative terms. During the crisis in Thebes, Oedipus believes that he is totally in charge: “I, Oedipus, whose name is known from afar.” In the opening scene of the play, Oedipus comes out himself to greet the suppliants and, before the opening lines are spoken, has already taken"},{"pageNumber":722,"pageContent":"694 Myths of the Tragic Heroes and Heroines FIGURE 16-2 Oedipus Being Questioned by the Sphinx. As depicted in this vase painting, the Sphinx (part woman, part lion, part eagle) poses the riddle to Oedipus, who sits, looking her tight in the eye, with his chin resting on his hand and his legs casually crossed. His air of bemused self-assurance suggests that he is patiently, if somewhat patronizingly, waiting for her to finish the question so that he can state aloud the answer he has already deduced. ( Vatican Museums, Rome) appropriate action. He has no inkling at this stage that the illusion of control is about to be shattered or that the general human condition applies to him. Another major implication of the riddle is that a human being is by nature a riddle—a mystery even to himself. Is it possible for humans to truly know them- selves, as Apollo commands.^ Oedipus may be able to follow the clues and fill in the blank surface data of his identity—his birthplace and the name of his parents— but there are depths to his own psyche that he doesn’t even begin to suspect until the very last moment. Even Jocasta, who doesn’t want to know, recognizes the horror before Oedipus does—that an admired and respected individual, an upright citizen and a leader of his community, conceals beneath his conscious self a shadow self that is capable of the most appalling crimes: the monster that the hero must confront is now the libidinous beast within. He is no more in control of his psyche than he will be of his body in old age."},{"pageNumber":723,"pageContent":"The Tragic House ofLaius 695 The Male and Female Principles The Sphinx, a winged creature with the head of a woman and the body of a lion, combines the ancient symbols of the Great Goddess, with her birds and beasts. Like all heroes, Oedipus must defeat her to fulfill his role. One modern poet, Muriel Rukeyser, suggests, in her witty revision of the myth, that Oedipus misses the point of the riddle, and thus fails to recognize his mother, because he is blind to the riddle s feminine component: saying “man,” he excludes women. The word man includes women, Rukeyser’s Oedipus argues. “That’s what you think,” replies the Sphinx. While the modern poet is commenting on Oedipus’s sexist language, the poem also touches on his larger failure, in the myth itself, to acknowledge the feminine principle. In his conventional masculine-heroic identification of his integrity with the need to pursue his quest for his identity to its bitter end, regardless of the consequences, Oedipus is determined to “go forward always,” like Hector or any other hero. And like all those other heroes who follow in the footsteps of Heracles, Oedipus, who had already separated himself from the family he had in Gorinth, destroys the one he acquired in Thebes: his wife/mother is dead, and no normal future for his daughters is now possible. It is no mere coincidence that, like the Sphinx who was also destroyed by Oedipus, Jocasta knew the truth long before Oedipus did but was destroyed when he “solved” the riddle and answered the question. Like many other women in Greek mythology, from Megara and Andromache to Clytemnestra and Agave, Jocasta finds that the heroic approach to experience, whether assumed by their husbands or, in a reversal of roles, by the women themselves, is destructive to women both in literal terms and in the only two roles they are allowed: marriage and motherhood. Unlike Heracles’ quests, though, Oedipus’s quest is an interior one. From the archetypal perspective, the descent into the unconscious is the descent into the womb of the mother, the exploration of the female principle that thus makes possible the recovery of the anima. The very quest that destroys Oedipus’s actual mother allows him to find the mother within himself. It is only when Oedipus, having discovered the truth, accepts the mystery of his fate and of the gods’ role in bringing it about, and so resigns himself to his condition of metaphysical blindness, that he is reconciled with the feminine principle, as was Tiresias before him. It is thus appropriate that, as the myths attest, when Oedipus goes out on the road again, this time in exile, it will be one of his daughters, not one of his sons, who will guide him on his final journey. The Metaphysical Dimensions of the Oedipus Myth Perhaps the most important implication of Oedipus’s response to the Sphinx’s riddle is that Oedipus—the supreme riddler—believes that all questions have answers and that humans can ascertain those answers by applying their wits and their logic. That there are questions that have no answers, that some mysteries are permanently insol- uble, and that the cosmos of the gods may be as far beyond the reach of human reason as the human psyche is beneath it never occurs to him. Why do terrible things happen to good people who are trying to do the right thing? Why do the gods call down such a fate on individuals even before they are born? Humans who have suffered have"},{"pageNumber":724,"pageContent":"696 Myths of the Tragic Heroes and Heroines always asked, “why me?” and “why now?” Destiny or choice? The play poses a riddle that seems to have no dehnitive answer. Once awakened from his illusion that life has a clear purpose and that he is in rational control, Oedipus comes hnally to accept the mystery—that the gods are not obliged to explain themselves to humans and that mere human logic is insufficient to explain their intentions or even to know whether they have any at all. Logic presup- poses observable facts and relationships and thus can hardly be an adequate guide in a world in which the blind see but the sighted do not. Oedipus, in his blindness, literalizes the condition of all tragic heroes—of all human beings—groping blindly in a world they must inhabit but cannot comprehend. Oedipus s Triumph Recognizing that Apollo is in some indecipherable way behind the events in his life, Sophocles’ Oedipus nevertheless freely asserts his own integrity and insists on taking responsibility for his acts. His father, Laius, had exposed his son to the elements instead of simply killing him, presumably to avoid being held responsible for the child’s death: when he died, it would be the gods’ doing. For Oedipus, blaming the gods would be another attempt to escape. Instead, Oedipus insists, whatever Apollo might or might not have contributed to the circumstances in his life, “I did it.” Paradoxically, his newfound awareness of the truth about his limits, of his essential ignorance, of the fact that he cannot ever know to what extent Apollo is responsible for his life’s course, leaves him free. From the first, Oedipus accepts his role as scapegoat—just as in the ancient ritual—taking the people’s sins on himself and ultimately redeeming them through his sacrifice and suffering. The plague lifts, and order is restored in Thebes. At the same time, he redeems himself, asserting his freedom even in the act of accepting the burdens that fate has heaped on him. Not only does he impose pain on himself, in his self-blinding, far more intense than anything Apollo required, but he also reaches a kind of moral transcendence. To Oedipus’s infinite credit, when all the facts begin falling into place as a result of his logical investigation, he confronts the truth squarely. No longer attempting to avoid the inevitable, Oedipus now insists (as heroes must), “Let it come.” In a moment of blinding insight, he recognizes the horror within. At that moment, in one of the play’s many ironies, Apollo and Dionysus, control and excess, fate and freedom converge on each other. By putting his eyes out, an ironic reversal of his previous failure to see, Oedipus confronts the reality that only the gods have seen and which is more than mortal eyes can bear. Like Tiresias, Oedipus acquires true vision, his unflinching awareness of the truth in all its complexity. He may stop the flow of sensory data, but he cannot shut off his mind. What is dredged up from the depths of his psyche cannot again be repressed. The sighted Oedipus had been blind; the blinded Oedipus becomes, like Tiresias, a seer. In an act of supreme moral courage, when death would be the easy way out, Oedipus chooses to live with the curse of awareness, with the knowledge that is pain. As Tiresias had said, “To be wise is to suffer.” Following the archetypal path of mythic heroes, Oedipus experiences total alienation from his community, descends to the death of his own inner hell, and returns.

Only now—when the terrible burden has been released and his fate is most completely fulfilled—is Oedi- pus at last truly free. Oedipus dt Colonus It is this redeemed Oedipus whom Sophocles, in his final play (produced posthu- mously, in 401 B.C.), sets on the road to Colonus, a village on the outskirts of Athens where the playwright himself had been born. Tradition asserted that Oedipus was buried there and that a shrine devoted to Oedipus, Theseus, and other ancient heroes was located on the spot. In the nearly twenty-five years between Oedipus Rex and Oedipus at Colonus, Sophocles reconsidered the myth, changing his mind about Oedipus himself, as well as about some specific details in the play. For example, in Oedipus Rex, Oedipus was ready to go into exile immediately, though it is not clear that he actually did so; in Oedipus at Colonus, his exile had apparently been delayed, and his daughter Antigone, a child in the earlier play, has reached adulthood and has guided her blind father on his journey. Meanwhile, Oedipus’s sons, Eteocles and Polyneices, have taken over the govern- ment of Thebes from the hands of Creon, who had been ruling as regent. But the brothers quarreled, and Polyneices, now married to the daughter of the king of Argos, is leading an army against Thebes. Further complicating the situation, the oracle has revealed that victory and prosperity will be assured for whichever city earns Oedipus’s goodwill while he lives and secures the right to retain his bones when he dies. Thus, Oedipus’s sons—who shunned their father as a defiler of civilized society during his exile and are now about to do battle with each other—want the old man back as a guarantor of their rival claims to power over Thebes. Contemporary Relevance The threat of war, particularly the war Oedipus predicts between Thebes and Athens, would have been immediately relevant to the Athenian audience—in fact, Thebes and Athens, on opposite sides in the Peloponnesian War, had recently fought a minor battle. Some Athenians credited their victory in that encounter to the presence of the shrine and the blessing that Oedipus had bestowed on the city. Colonus had already been burned by the Spartans in 406 B.C. and was in ruins. The Athenians would, of course, also have responded enthusiastically to the play’s praise of Athens as a city of justice and law. Similarities and Differences between the Two Oedipus Plays Both Oedipus Rex and Oedipus at Colonus share a thread of common contemporary references. Other components of the earlier play are also retained in Oedipus at Co- lonus. For example, Oedipus still bears the burden of being tainted by the pollution of his sins, so that the inhabitants of Colonus are at first terrified of allowing him to stay. Even though several cities compete for his remains, none wants Oedipus, alive or dead, to enter the precincts of the town. Only the Eumenides, or Furies (tactfully"},{"pageNumber":726,"pageContent":"698 Myths of the Tragic Heroes and Heroines called the “Kindly Ones”), who are themselves shunned by humans and gods alike, allow him to enter their sacred grove unharmed. In his unremitting anger, the Oedipus in the last play is also portrayed as being like the earlier character. This time, his anger is largely directed against his son Poly- neices, who, like his father, refuses to back down and will pursue his intended war against Thebes despite pleas from his sister and warnings from his father. Sophocles’ final portrayal of Oedipus, however, while continuing that of Oedipus Rex in some respects, is also very different in others. In fact, in many ways, the later play inverts the earlier. In Oedipus Rex, the hero insisted on his moral responsibility for his acts, whereas, in Oedipus at Colonus, he insists on his essential innocence, blaming the gods for the sinful acts he unwittingly committed and arguing that his self-blinding was an overreaction in the heat of the moment. And whereas earlier his greatness lay in his determination to wrench his freedom from the hands of fate and shunt the gods aside, now he relishes the role of victim: here, “suffering, not doing,” is his strength. Oedipus’s innocence is underscored by the approval of that favorite mythic hero Theseus and further by the thunder—the sign from Zeus—that reverberates through the play. And whereas, in the earlier play, Oedipus wrongly attacked the innocent Tiresias and Creon, in this play, Creon is depicted, as he is in Sophocles’ earlier Antigone, as self-serving and tyrannical, trying to use Oedipus for his own political purposes and abusing Oedipus’s daughters. In contrast to his insistence in the earlier play on self-sufficiency, Oedipus now admits his dependency and confesses his loneliness. Whereas before he couldn’t wait to see what fate would bring, he has now learned patience. Similarly, out of his earlier alienation, isolated in his exile and blindness, he perceives the extent of his love for his daughters, for the bonds of the human world from which he has been long exiled, just at the moment when he is about to leave the human world for good. The Reconciliation of Opposites Oedipus at Colonus does not merely invert the conditions of the earlier play, however; in this play, opposites are reconciled in a series of paradoxes. Thus, Oedipus is here a victim who has been patient through terrible suffering. But he is no saint; rather, he has become himself an avenger, a “Fury”—cursing his son directly (in contrast to the passive curse transferred from Laius to Oedipus in the earlier play). The victim of fate has also become its active agent. In the earlier play, too, Oedipus was the sighted man who was blind. Now, the blinded Oedipus sees: having come guided by An- tigone, he now finds his own way to the “holy mystery” of his end. And, having once repudiated their interference in his life, he now achieves reconciliation with the gods through the acceptance of their will. The Dread Goddesses While king of Thebes, the heroic Oedipus rejected the feminine principle, defying the various avatars of the Great Goddess, who is privy to the secrets of life and death; the Sphinx, who knew the secret of the riddle, “what is man?”; and Jocasta, who knew from the very first the secrets of the human psyche and who was presented in the earlier play in the usual heroic mode—the temptress whose attempts to get the"},{"pageNumber":727,"pageContent":"The Tragic House ofLaius 699 hero to abort his quest had to be rejected. Now, just as Oedipus rejects his sons, he embraces the feminine principle, abandoning the light of the intellect for the chthonic darkness of the “dread goddesses”: Oedipus, who has broken all taboos, commits one final violation in entering the sacred grove of the Eumenides. But in- stead of destroying him, they accept him, as if, having committed all forbidden acts, Oedipus has now transcended all taboos: nothing is now forbidden to him. Death and Transfiguration The final paradox of the play, of course, is the apotheosis of Oedipus, as he experi- ences death and transfiguration, the “holy mystery,” which only Theseus is permitted to witness. Having descended to the depths, Oedipus is at last not only freed but deified as well. The cursed one is now himself a dispenser of curses and blessings— the former to his son, the latter to Athens. Like the Furies, he has become one of the Kindly Ones. Antigone The earliest of Sophocles’ plays on the family of Oedipus, Antigone (c. 442 — 441 B.c.) follows the tragic story of the House ofLaius after Oedipus’s death. The civil war between Oedipus’s sons over rulership of Thebes is over. Both brothers are dead, but Eteocles, who defended Thebes, is buried with honor, while the corpse of Polyneices, who attacked Thebes, is left unburied at the orders of Creon, who now assumes the rulership. Creon argues that the security of the state demands that traitors be punished. Offended at this act of utter impiety (proper burial of the dead being required by the gods if the soul is to find eternal rest), Antigone argues that the gods are a higher authority than the state and, courageously defying Creon’s orders, she attempts to bury her brother’s body herself Ostensibly a debate, Sophocles’ Antigone has been variously interpreted as focused on the conflicting demands of the state and the individual, or of the political order (Creon’s claim that to honor a traitor is to invite anarchy) and religious principles (Antigone’s claim that to refuse to bury a corpse constitutes blasphemy), or even of family-based chthonic religion centered on the cult of the dead and the public, our- anic religion of the city. The play does, in fact, include several formal debates on such issues. Seen exclusively as a topical drama, the play seems to lack the explicitly “mythological” components of the two later plays of Sophocles’ Oedipus cycle— Oedipus Rex, with its Apollonian oracles and riddles, and Oedipus at Colonus, with its Furies and the final apotheosis of the hero. It is, rather, in the rite of passage of the heroine herself that we may perceive the subtle mythical dimensions of Atigone’s story. The Tyranny of Creon Composed at the height of the Athenian experiment in democracy, Antigone, not surprisingly, is concerned with political issues and is, in fact, the most overtly political of Sophocles’ surviving plays. When the play opens, Creon has just assumed the"},{"pageNumber":728,"pageContent":"700 Myths of the Tragic Heroes and Heroines kingship by default; Eteocles and Polyneices, Oedipus’s sons, have died in the civil war that ended so recently that Polyneices’ body still lies intact, just outside the city walls. Precariously installed on the throne, Creon is understandably apprehensive about his ability to maintain civic order in a city that has just emerged from chaos. No sooner does he issue his first edict, meant to shore up his rulership by invoking the patriotism of the citizens, than it is violated, and as it turns out, by a member of his own family—his niece, Antigone, who is also engaged to his son Haemon. Antigone at first secretly gives the body a ritual or symbolic burial, covering it with a token coating of dust, but when her work is undone on Creon’s orders, she is caught re- peating the act. When Antigone then insists on defying Creon publicly, he is on the spot, aware that he is being “tested.” The debate begins rationally enough. But Creon keeps ratcheting up the terms of the argument, as his anger incrementally increases. When Creon first hears about the “burial,” he lashes out, blaming “anarchists” and imagining bribery and corruption everywhere. And from the first, something clearly is amiss in his methods of gover- nance: his own sentry is afraid to do his duty and swears he will not return to Creon’s presence. The chorus supports Creon to his face, but Haemon describes “whispers” of negative public opinion, voiced only out of the hearing of Creon, who terrifies the citizens. If Oedipus was the model ruler, taking the people’s suffering on himself, Creon is the reverse. In a democracy such as Athens’, of course, there may be a conflict between two “right” positions. But it isn’t long before Creon has reduced the alternatives in gov- ernment to anarchy or tyranny—he must be obeyed “in all things, great and small, just and unjust,” an argument that reaches its logical conclusion in Creon’s most extreme assertion that “the State is the King.” “Only,” replies Haemon, “if the State is a desert” (or, perhaps, the surely sympathetic Athenian audience might have added, if the state is Sparta, where dictatorship reigned). In the swiftness with which Creon moves from reasoned debate to tyrannical abuse, Sophocles vividly dramatizes the necessity of a democratic leader’s listening to both sides of an issue and to the “voice of the Demos.” By obstinately standing alone, Creon reveals the folly of equating the leader’s will with the welfare of the polls. In his rage, Creon threatens to execute Ismene, Antigone’s younger sister, too, but Haemon’s warnings about public opinion have apparently sunk in, and he quickly backs down. The Prophecies of Tiresias But Creon refuses to yield on the punishment of Antigone, and even the arrival of Tiresias, who denounces him and predicts catastrophe, fails to persuade Creon to change his course. In fact, he accuses Tiresias, just as Oedipus had, of taking bribes and fronting for conspirators. However, by bringing in Tiresias, as he would in Oe- dipus Rex, Sophocles has, in effect, called in the heavy artillery: the dichotomy was false all along. The gods, Tiresias tells Creon, are offended at the denial of burial rites, and Creon was simply wrong to make that an issue in the first place. Reminded by the ever-fearful chorus that Tiresias always speaks the truth, Creon relents—but too late to prevent the deaths of Antigone, of Haemon, or of Creon’s wife, Eurydice, who commits suicide on hearing of her son’s death. To his credit, Creon belatedly acknowledges his guilt. But unlike the realization of Oedipus, there is no sense of transcendence in Creon’s admission and subsequent"},{"pageNumber":729,"pageContent":"The Tragic House of Laius 701 fate. He behaved stupidly, and others paid the price. Helped into the palace by mem- bers of the chorus, Creon has forfeited the authority he wrongly set out to enhance, while setting in motion a chain of personal tragedies. In fact, some readers see Creon, rather than Antigone, as the real protagonist of the play. But while he certainly re- ceives the greatest amount of attention in the play, he has nothing of the “hero” about him. Fearful of losing his authority, fearful of public opinion and of his niece’s poten- tial power to sway that against him, fearful of Tiresias’s prophecies and finally of the gods themselves, Creon is an ordinary man trapped in an extraordinary position. The utmost demands are made on his comxpassion, insight, and leadership, and he dem- onstrates that he is capable of none of those qualities. In effect, Sophocles uses Creon as an example of what a leader should not do. Antigone’s Roles When we encounter Antigone in the opening lines of the play, she has already made the fatal decision to defy Creon’s orders and risk death by carrying out the burial rite, symbolically sprinkling some dirt and wine over the corpse of her brother. A loyal sister, Antigone is first presented as a variant of the traditional heroine as loyal wife or mother. Initially, carrying out the ritual on her brother’s behalf is the extent of her intention. She plans to have her younger sister, Ismene, help her. But as she encoun- ters resistance from Ismene and then from Creon, she grows increasingly defiant and, in the process, increasingly assumes the masculine hero’s stance. Antigone as Hero-Impersonator Ismene first raises the gender issue, protesting that she and her sister are “just weak women” who “cannot fight with men.” In response, like any of the male heroes whose women want to keep them inside the protective walls of the home or city, Antigone rejects Ismene’s advice, dismissing her beloved younger sister lest she find her “hateful.” From this point on, Antigone increasingly isolates herself—from her sister, with whom she refuses to share the blame, or credit, for her act; from the chorus, whose potential sympathy she shuts off by her defiance; from her fiance, to whom she never even asks to speak; and finally, from the world of the living altogether. The ultimate hero’s quest—the journey to the Underworld—is one that must be made unaccom- panied. Thus, we are not surprised to find Antigone declaring that to risk death in pursuit of what Ismene calls “impossible things” is preferable to the “worst of deaths—death without honor.” Moving beyond the simple, pious motive with which she began—burial of the body—Antigone has added another—the quest for per- sonal honor—thus aligning herself with the traditional heroic model. Ismene, however, is right; conventionally, “weak women” do not fight civic au- thority, do not stand up alone against a king with an army and the apparent weight of public opinion, as expressed by the chorus, behind him. Antigone has entered uncharted territory—a woman “impersonating” a male hero. We can see the trans- formation in progress as she carries out her mission. The first time she buries the body, she does so in secret, at night; the second time, she does so at noon, in broad daylight. And when she is hauled before the king, she is aggressively outspoken, even calling him a “fool” in public, as bold in her verbal assault as Achilles was in confront- ing Agamemnon—perhaps more so, since she has no sword to unsheath to back up her fighting words."},{"pageNumber":730,"pageContent":"702 Myths of the Tragic Heroes and Heroines Her integrity, courage, and aggressiveness stand out even more in contrast to the chorus, well-to-do older men of Thebes who are afraid to speak up before Creon and only whisper behind his back until Tiresias validates Antigone’s position. Then they literally change their tune. Even Haemon is initially deferential, claiming at first to value his father’s “wisdom” more than any marriage. Only gradually, after failing to persuade his father to be reasonable, and using the grounds of public opinion to cover for his own, does Haemon come to Antigone’s defense. The chorus’s comment, which they intend as a criticism, reveals to us the awesome extent of Antigone’s heroic achievement; Antigone, they declare, has “passed beyond all human daring.” Creon, who is certainly blind to his own political folly, responds instantly to An- tigone’s bursting of the shackles of gender. “Pride? In a slave?” he asks, although Antigone is referred to by the sentry as “Princess Antigone,” a social role Creon must have honored when he allowed his own son Haemon to be betrothed to her. If she is a “slave,” it is to the social conventions that confine females to the status of “weak women” and destroy them when they prove otherwise. Creon goes on to accuse An- tigone not only of “double insolence” in breaking the law and having the temerity to boast of having done so but, worse, of breaking that social code; “Who is the man here, she or I, if this crime goes unpunished?” If Creon lashes out at Antigone and refuses to yield despite the pleas of Haemon, the pressure of public opinion, and the warnings of Tiresias, the mouthpiece of the gods, it is because it is more than “law” and civic authority that Creon is defending; it is his masculine identity. Antigone as Bride of Death Heroines who opt for the masculine heroic model traditionally do not fare very well. Those who, like Clytemnestra or Agave, commit crimes in liberating themselves from oppressive gender toles are suitably punished by the gods or their human agents. Those like Atalanta, whose only “crime” is the defi- ance of social convention itself, find themselves undone by the goddess the chorus refers to as “merciless Aphrodite.” Antigone, however, commits no crimes in the eyes of the gods; nor does she stoop to pick up any golden apples that the love goddess might have planted in her path. Rather, like Iphigenia and other heroines from Al- cestis to Psyche, she becomes a bride of death. But unlike those heroines, who take on that role as victims because they must, Sophocles’ Antigone chooses that role consciously, almost too eagerly, from the earliest stages of her development as a hero- ine. “It is the dead, not the living,” she tells Ismene, “who make the longest de- mands.” And when she is condemned by Creon, she refuses, to allow Ismene to “lessen” her death “by sharing it.” The distinction between them, Antigone insists, is that Ismene is “alive” but “I belong to Death.” It is not just that she accepts Death as a sacrifice in the name of piety, as Iphigenia does in the name of patriotism. It is, rather, that she reaches out and embraces Death. She does so, furthermore, as a substitute for marriage. Once again, the contrast with Iphigenia is revealing. Lured to the sacrificial altar on the pretense that she will be married to Achilles, Iphigenia finds that she will be “married” to Death instead. But while she accepts the necessity of her sacrifice, she did not choose that fate for herself. Antigone, in contrast, intentionally elects to be the bride of Death. Creon, too, has substituted death for love not only literally, for Antigone, but for himself as well. Ordering the death of his own son’s intended bride, Creon dismisses the concept that love represents anything more than sex; “there are places enough for"},{"pageNumber":731,"pageContent":"The Tragic House ofLaius 703 him to push his plow.” As government, for Creon, is a kingdom of one, fitting only for a desert, so marriage is likewise a self-serving arrangement. Creon has shut himself off from any meaningful human relationships. During his debate with Haemon, Creon asks, “If I permit my own family to rebel, how shall I earn the world’s obedi- ence?” To defend his position as king, he has shut himself off from his family, and he ends up with neither. His loss of his family is the inevitable consequence of that hardening of the heart. The chorus asks Creon, “do you really intend to steal this girl from your son?” as if sexual jealousy were the mainspring of his action. “No,” replies Creon, “Death will do that for me.” Even the erotic envy he denies would have been, in some way, more human, more alive. As if to remind us of the contrast, the only deities the chorus refers to in the play are Aphrodite, Eros, and Dionysus, god of joy and passion, to whom they sing a hymn. But neither Antigone nor Creon hears the music of the wine god. Creon’s vulgar substitution of Death for sex has its counterpart in An- tigone’s substitution, albeit nobler in purpose, of death for love. Both impulses are life-denying: Eros is supplanted by Thanatos. It is not Creon, but Death, who is rival to Haemon in courtship of Antigone. And she emphatically chooses Death over Haemon. Antigone “Stoned to Death” Summoned by Death to the Underworld where, she says, there is “no bridesong,” Antigone compares herself to Niobe, who was turned to stone because she could not stop weeping over the loss of her children. Antigone says she feels the “loneliness of her death in mine.” Yet, unlike Niobe, Antigone has chosen isolation. She has rejected Ismene and, though she laments being denied the prospect of marriage, she makes no mention of Haemon, as if she has already passed not only “far beyond all human daring” but far beyond all human love as well, and has “come at last to a place of stone” that is both her tomb and the marriage bed on which Haemon will join her in death. Creon had originally decreed that whoever dared to bury Polyneices would be stoned to death; instead, as if internalizing that decree, Antigone has turned her heart to stone, shutting off all feeling. Of course, her family betrayed her: the consequences of her parents’ incestuous marriage and her brothers’ self-destructive warfare left her bereft of any family apart from her sister. Ismene’s refusal to help with the burial seems to have severed Antigone’s last family bond. For all her insistence on acting out of love for her brother, she seems to have been more in love with death. In burying Polyneices, she was also burying the last vestige of her capacity to love. Enclosed in a stony prison of self where no further betrayal or loss is possible, she has ironically become a counterpart to Creon, and the stone vault in which she is entombed be- comes a fitting emblem for her psychological state. Entering the cave that will be her tomb, a “vaulted bride-bed in eternal rock,” she becomes, like Persephone, a bride of Hades, hanging herself there with her bridal veil. Unlike the goddess, though, An- tigone will not be able to return to the world of the living. Every hero, of course, enters the Underworld, and Antigone has thus far followed the heroic path. But, for the male hero, the journey to the Underworld is a turning point, to be followed, in the usual structure of the heroic quest, by the hero’s return, his rebirth into the world of the living, bearing new knowledge and the possibility for transcendence in the hereafter. Even Oedipus, the pollution of whose incestuous"},{"pageNumber":732,"pageContent":"704 Myths of the Tragic Heroes and Heroines marriage Antigone sees as causing the destruction of her own, undergoes apotheosis and becomes the object of a hero cult. For a woman, however, the journey to the Underworld is usually a one-way trip. Having elected to pursue the heroic course instead of letting go of the dead and accepting marriage to Haemon, Antigone has chosen to martyr herself, a choice con- firmed by the swiftness with which she ends her own life, preempting Creons reversal and the decision to release her that come moments too late to prevent her death or those of Haemon and Eurydice to follow. Haemon as Nexus It is Haemon who provides the nexus between the major strands of Sophocles’ drama—the political and the personal, the masculine and the feminine. The long debate during which Haemon tries, patiently and rationally, to persuade his father to bury Polyneices and free Antigone stands in stark counterpoint to the later scene in which, entering the cave, Creon finds Haemon embracing Antigone’s corpse, bewail- ing his lost love. Now the language of debate, a suitable vehicle for political discourse but an inadequate one for powerful emotions, gives way to silence. Haemon speaks “not a word”: love and hatred speak more profoundly through the language of the body. Having embraced Antigone, Haemon attempts to stab his father and, missing, turns the sword on himself. Both Haemon and Antigone began with a rational deter- mination to act according to the demands of political wisdom or piety. Both end their lives in irrational and tragically unnecessary acts of suicide. Standing on the brink of the abyss, of a world beyond the reach of reason, Antigone leaps in, and Haemon follows. Haemon is highly unusual among Greek heroes: dying for love had not become the romantic tradition that Sophocles’ play foreshadows—the “liebestod” (love-and- death) theme—and that would later elevate the deaths of heroes, from Shakespeare’s Romeo to Goethe’s Werther or Wagner’s Tristan, to the level of the sublime. It is, after all, the task of the mythological hero to rescue the maiden from death, not to join her there—to release the terrified girl chained to a rock or entombed, as Perseus rescued Andromeda and Heracles freed Hesione (a Trojan princess likewise chained to a rock). Heracles even released Alcestis from the Underworld itself Compared to the traditional Greek mythological hero, who must reject the erotic or domestic temptation that would deflect him from his quest, Haemon has behaved in a way normally associated with women. Alcestis may be willing to die, and Medea to kill, for love. Jason scorns Medea, though, for being so concerned about love in the first place, a response he contemptuously attributes to the influence of Aphrodite. In Sophocles’ play, it is Antigone-as-hero who implicitly denies Aphrodite, and Haemon who is under the goddess’s spell. Creon had condemned Antigone for appropriating the male role. As Antigone increasingly adopts the heroic male attitudes, her fiance, rejecting his father’s mode, increasingly appropriates the traditionally feminine re- sponse. For Haemon, love achieves what the sword failed to accomplish. Thus, Hae- mon opens a new path to transcendence for the hero, mediating the opposition of Eros and Thanatos and, like Antigone, finding fulfillment in the joining of love and death."},{"pageNumber":733,"pageContent":"The Tragic House ofLaius 705 Antigone and Romeo and Juliet Over two thousand years later, an English playwright would create a highly similar double death scene in another drama of young lovers tragically caught up in a world of violence and political rivalry. But the tragedy of Haemon and Antigone only su- perficially resembles that of Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet, and the difference is in- structive. Shakespeare’s lovers mutually commit themselves to love, and they die in the attempt to make their marriage possible. But while Romeo, like Haemon, kills himself on entering the tomb and finding his beloved dead, Haemon and Antigone are no “star-crossed lovers.” Whereas Romeo begins by defying his father and hers in order to share his love with Juliet, Haemon begins by declaring that obedience to his father means more to him than marriage. Then, as the grip of “merciless Aphrodite” grows increasingly powerful, and as he becomes increasingly enraged at his father and determined first to defend Antigone and then to die with her if he cannot live with her, the trajectory of her path moves in the opposite direction, away from love, away from the affirmation of life. Juliet’s death is an accident of timing, not, at least initially, a choice. She enters the tomb where she will die expecting the fairy-tale ending, to be awakened with a kiss. Antigone, in contrast, has no wish to be awakened and strangles herself with the bridal veil she would have worn to wed Haemon. When Haemon embraces her in death, she has not merely died before him, as Juliet did Romeo; she has long since abandoned the world of the living and left him far behind."},{"pageNumber":734,"pageContent":"OEDIPUS REX’ Sophocles CHARACTERS OEDIPUS, king of Thebes A PRIEST CREON, brother-in-law of Oedipus CHORUS of Theban elders TEiRESiAS, a prophet JOCASTA, sister ofCreon, wife of Oedipus MESSENGER SERVANT ofLaius, father of Oedipus SECOND MESSENGER (silent) ANTIGONE and ISMENE, daughters of Oedipus SCENE Before the palace of Oedipus at Thebes.

The slight frame and fair skin of Helios (left), whose garlanded head radiates a solar brilliance, contrasts markedly with the darker complexions and sinuous musculature of Hephaestus and his four assistants. Although momentarily rendered immobile by the unwelcome news, the ingenious god of metalcraft soon devises a way to trap and expose the guilty lovers to public shame (see Chapter 5). {Museo del Prado, Madrid.)"},{"pageNumber":785,"pageContent":"Color Plate 15 Titian, Venus and Adonis, 1562.

Turning to classical myths just as Picasso did to express the complexities of the modern world (see Figure 21-5), Dali took as his subject the story of Narcissus, who fell in love with his own reflection in a pond and was turned into the flower that bears his name. In this painting, Dali comments on the self-destructive potential, the essentially narcis- sistic nature, of psychoanalysis. (Expressing his usual wit, he brought this painting to show Freud when he met the “father of psychoanalysis”!) The figure on the left stares inward at itself, its face a blank to the external world. To the right, the figure of the hand (the psychoanalyst?) that holds an egg—simultaneously the head and embryo of the self—recapitulates the figure on the left. Immobilized in stone, the egg burst forth in flower, reborn in the act of self-analysis. But it does so alone, apart from the dance of humanity that has receded to the background. The “crack” in the egg/head on the left reveals the result: the flower, too, will soon be petrified—reduced to an image, the life, like the color, has gone out of it.

Why has he summoned The old men to hear him? [Enter from the Palace, C. He addresses the cuomjs from the top step.] Creon Gentlemen: I have the honor to inform you that our Ship of State, which recent storms have threatened to destroy, has come safely to harbor at last, guided by the merciful wisdom of Heaven. I have summoned you here this morning because I know that I can depend upon you: your devotion to King Laios was absolute; you never hesitated in your duty to our late ruler Oedipus; and when Oedipus died, your loyalty was transferred to his children. Unfortunately, as you know, his two sons, the princes Eteocles and Polyneices, have killed each other in battle; and I, as the next in blood, have succeeded to the full power of the throne. I am aware, of course, that no Ruler can expect complete loyalty from his subjects until he has been tested in office. Nevertheless, I say to you at the very outset that I have nothing but contempt for the kind of Governor who is afraid, for whatever reason, to follow the course that he knows is best for the State; and as for the man who sets private friendship above the public welfare,—I have no use for him, either. I call God to witness that if I saw my country headed for ruin, I should not be afraid to speak out plainly; and I need hardly remind you that I would never have any dealings with an enemy of the people. No one values friendship more highly than I; but we must remember that friends made at the risk of wrecking our Ship are not real friends at all. These are my principles, at any rate, and that is why I have made the fol- lowing decision concerning the sons of Oedipus: Eteocles, who died as a man should die, fighting for his country, is to be buried with full military honors, with all the ceremony that is usual when the greatest heroes die; but his brother Polyneices, who broke his exile to come back with fire and sword against his native city and the shrines of his fathers’ gods, whose one idea was to spill the blood of his blood and sell his own people into slavery—Polyneices, I say, is to have no burial: no man is to touch him or say the least prayer for him; he shall lie on the plain, unburied; and the birds and the scavenging dogs can do with him whatever they like. This is my command, and you can see the wisdom behind it. As long as I am King, no traitor is going to be honored with the loyal man. But whoever shows by word and deed that he is on the side of the State,—he shall have my respect while he is living, and my reverence when he is dead. Choragos If that is your will, Greon son of Menoikeus, You have the right to enforce it: we are yours. Creon That is my will.

Having few rights, they endured various forms of oppression and exploitation. Medea's common-law husband, Jason, was the leader of the Argonauts and had won the Golden Fleece only because Medea had helped him to do so. But now he has abandoned her for the attractive and wealthy princess of Corinth and soon demands custody of the children as well. Euripides uses Medea's violent response to her predicament as a source of commentary on the condition of women in Athens and on the conventions of tragedy itself. Euripides A younger contemporary of Aeschylus and Sophocles, Euripides (c. 485-406 B.c.) was considered somewhat unconventional, both personally and intellectually. A loner who had his own private library, Euripides took little part in the public affairs that dominated the lives of most of his fellow Athenians. Euripides wrote eighty-eight plays, of which nineteen survive. But although his fellow playwrights (especially Sophocles) were interested in his work, and although he achieved enormous popularity after his death when revivals began to be per- formed, he won only four first prizes at the City Dionysia in his lifetime. His rather complex plays may have seemed too strange, too repulsive, or possibly even too deca- dent for his generally conservative audience. In his last year, he left Athens altogether and went to Macedonia. 792"},{"pageNumber":829,"pageContent":"Euripides ’ Medea 793 The woman s Perspective It is easy to see why Euripides’ Medea (431 B.C.) might have startled an audience expecting plays like those of Aeschylus or Sophocles. The play stresses the female perspective, which was not in itself unusual, but Euripides provides a sympathetic portrayal both of one woman’s plight in particular and of all women in general. Eike the typical helper-maiden, Medea has done everything for Jason, giving up, in ex- change for his false promise to marry her later, her home, her family ties, and her reputation. She saved his life by helping him obtain the Golden Fleece. In fact, Jason’s success in that endeavor depended almost entirely on Medea. According to the vari- ous myths describing the Argonauts’ expedition (not, of course, included in Eu- ripides’ play), Medea gave Jason the magical means to yoke the fire-breathing bulls and plow the field, to slay the armed men who sprang from the sowed dragon’s teeth, and to put to sleep the dragon that guarded the Golden Eleece. Jason had, in other words, more help from Medea than any other hero had in completing his appointed tasks. Among traditional heroes, only Perseus is given magical aids, and none of those either render his opponents harmless to him or relieve him of the need to figure out on his own how to make effective use of the divinely given equipment. Once Jason has obtained the Golden Fleece, Medea also enables the Argonauts to escape the wrath of her father, Aeetes. After they arrive in lolcus, she continues to help him by conspiring in the killing of his uncle, Pelias, who had usurped the throne of Aeson (Jason’s father) and would have killed Jason. Similar to Ariadne’s abandonment by Theseus, Medea’s reward is to have Jason desert her in Corinth for a younger, richer, and prettier (if not very bright) woman, who happens to be the daughter of the king. Medea had the misfortune to fall in love with a hero who turned out to be, after all, just a man—and not a very admirable one at that. Early in the play, Jason denies Medea’s part in helping him get the Golden Fleece, insisting that it was Cypris (Aph- rodite), not Medea, who saved him. Other versions of the myth assert that Aphrodite, at the request of FTera and Athene, sends Eros to cause Medea to fall in love with Jason, knowing that he will be unable to fulfill his quest without her intervention. But loving Jason does not automatically entail her betrayal of her father in order to help him. Indeed, the myths portray her as struggling with the conflicting demands of love for the hero and loyalty to her family. In Euripides’ play, however, no one but Jason puts forth such an excuse, and he clearly has a vested interest in now denying her any credit or gratitude for her services to him as helper-maiden. Her unofficial “marriage” in ruins, the only meaningful role Medea has left is that of mother. But Jason, demanding custody of the children, wants to deprive her of that, too. Utterly isolated in the unfamiliar city to which he has brought her, she speaks convincingly both of the woman’s role—trapped whether she marries or not—and of society’s negative attitude toward strong, intelligent, and articulate women. The Heroic K/leded Medea, however, has other resources. Her role as helper-maiden having come to its typical conclusion, Medea takes on the role of hero herself Indeed, she has all the strengths more typically associated with male tragic protagonists in the heroic mold: the intensity, the refusal to compromise and sense of total commitment, and the"},{"pageNumber":830,"pageContent":"794 Myths of the Tragic Heroes and Heroines heroic acts. The leader of the chorus of townswomen implies that all mothers are heroic: Medea, she says, has, like the Argonauts, passed between the “grey Clashing Rocks” that guard the navigational route to Colchis, which she also associates with the dangers faced during childbirth. Apart from Euripides’ play, the mythic tradition accentuates the heroic side of Medea even further by portraying her, like many male heroes, as a founder of cities. According to Herodotus, for example, after leaving Corinth, Medea goes to Athens, whence she likewise must flee for attempting to poison King Aegeus’s son, Theseus (see Chapter 10). She then settles in Iran, where she becomes the eponymous ancestor of an entire nation: the inhabitants, previously called “Arians,” changed their name to “Medes,” after Medea. Other versions portray her as marrying Achilles after death and living with her heroic male counterpart in the Elysian Fields. Words versus Action Medea believes that, like all heroes, she has the gods on her side—not just Hecate, her personal deity, but also Themis, Lady of Vows, and Zeus, protector of oaths, whose lightning is identified with Medea’s fury. For the Greeks, oaths were not just casually uttered words—they were sacred. Breaking a vow was a major violation that even the gods themselves would hesitate to commit. Yet Jason is a breaker of oaths— specifically, the vows he made to Medea when he needed her help. Hence his fate, which Medea foresees, is fully deserved. Some readers thus argue that Medea is acting as an agent of Zeus, carrying out divine retribution against Jason. But it is not Jason who dies—it is the princess, whose only crime is to have been superficial, and the children, whose offenses consist merely of being Jason’s sons. To her credit, Medea does not resort to such extreme acts readily. By the time we meet Medea, she has already exhausted all other avenues, and even now, despite her rage, we find her still engaged in last-ditch attempts to use rhetoric, not violence. In fact, many speeches in the play are about rhetoric—about words and the logic of arguments. But words mean nothing to a breaker of vows; once the link between rhetoric and truth is broken, words become mere babble. Jason never listens to Medea’s arguments. And while he accuses her of being verbally aggressive (women should presumably be quiet!), she accuses him, quite properly, of using empty words. In language as in life, Jason confuses style with substance, just as he opts for the style of a successful life (a “good” home, adequate income) while ignoring the foundation of familial bonds on which a good home must rest. Jason’s actions have not matched his words; Medea’s will. She, too, has made a vow—to Queen Hecate. And she openly does what she says: she announces her in- tentions, carries out the murders, and, just as Clytemnestra had done, acknowledges the deeds afterwards. Once determined to act, Medea announces, “From now on all words are super- fluous.” It is from this point in the play that she speaks Jason’s language—the lan- guage of cliches and lies, weapons in the war between the sexes. Only then does she engage in a bit of playacting, miming the stereotypical “feminine” role—a weak creature given to crying instead of acting—in order to beguile Jason into unwittingly cooperating with her scheme to send the children with gifts to the princess! Naturally, unable to accept the truth about Medea or his dependence on her, he immediately accepts this lie."},{"pageNumber":831,"pageContent":"Euripides'yitAfa. 795 Tragedy and the Irrational Like most tragic protagonists, Medea is also a very passionate woman, as extreme in her love as she is in her hatred. We watch what happens when the irrational forces that tragedy always confronts (here depicted as almost elemental forces, “like a rock, or a wave of the sea”) drive Medea to act out her impulses in a way that is out of control and that ends up hurting those she loves: killing her brother, landing Jason in exile, and, finally, like Agave, murdering her own children. But like Agave, Medea is a woman, for whom all such actions are deemed inexcusable. The gods and the male heroes like Heracles who follow their divine models may get away with destroy- ing their children, but no expiatory rituals release the woman from that sin. Meded and Corinthian Ritual Medea does allude, in the last scene of Euripides’ play, to a ritual she will establish in the future to expiate “this impious murder,” but she seems to be referring to charter- ing a ritual by which the Corinthians will expiate their own guilt, rather than one by which Medea will do so herself. The ambiguity of that reference may be rooted in actual Corinthian rituals related to Medea, as well as in the complex and varied myths about her, not all of which portray her as killing her own children. Hesiod, for ex- ample, makes no mention of killing children. And according to Pindar, Zeus falls in love with Medea in Corinth, but she rejects his advances. Hera rewards Medea by promising to make her children immortal if Medea will bring them to her temple. In an oddly symmetrical inversion of the story of Medea’s false promise to rejuvenate the father of the lolcan princesses, Medea delivers her children to Hera’s temple, but the children die there, and Medea has to flee Corinth, despite the fact that the chil- dren’s death is not her fault. According to some scholars, one function of this myth may have been to charter a Corinthian ritual that involved seven boys and seven girls annually being sent to serve in the temple of Hera, as well as the Corinthians’ practice of offering sacrifices to Medea’s children during an important festival. In some versions of the myth, many Corinthian children die when Medea leaves Corinth, and the cult of Medea’s children is instituted, on the god’s instructions, to halt these deaths. In fact, some scholars suggest that Medea may originally have been a Corinthian goddess of childbirth and nursing mothers, equivalent to Hera, whose cult displaces hers. Similarly, while he does not connect her either to Hera or to the city of Corinth, Hesiod describes Medea as a goddess, granddaughter of Helios, the sun god, and a goddess named Perseis, whose children are Circe and Medea’s father, Aeetes. Medea’s mother, according to Hesiod, is Idyia, a sea goddess. But childbirth goddesses like Hera and Artemis could turn on the women in labor who appealed to them, slaying the mother or child or both, just as Apollo could be god of both health and disease. Medea, as patron of childbirth, could likewise share that ambiguous potential—another possible source of her role as “unnatural” mother. Another View of Meded The varying traditions in the Medea myths give rise to a complex figure who in- corporates contradictory roles: Greek and foreigner; helper-maiden and murderer;"},{"pageNumber":832,"pageContent":"796 Myths of the Tragic Heroes and Heroines mother/wife and child-killer; normal woman and witch; mortal and goddess. Eu- ripides makes no mention of any ritual other than Medea’s single reference at the end of the play And his Medea certainly kills her own children. Indeed, some scholars suggest that Euripides may have introduced the infanticide as a typically melodra- matic, theatrical device. But the playwright does take advantage of the varied and contradictory mythic resources to offer his audience a highly complex, multifaceted heroine. One of the most important characteristics of drama is its capacity to hold up multiple points of view for the audience’s inspection. In this play, as in many others, Euripides enhances that multiplicity of perspectives. No sooner do we begin to accept one perspective, than he shifts the angle slightly and a different perspective emerges. Thus, no sooner do we begin to sympathize with Medea’s predicament and to see her as a strong, tragic heroine, than we find ourselves confronting another side of Medea. For example, portraying herself as victim, she does not mention that she eloped with Jason willingly; further, although marriage is in some ways always a betrayal of the woman’s family, she alienated her father in more than the usual way—she killed her younger brother Apsyrtus and scattered the pieces of his corpse over the waves to stop her father’s pursuit of Jason and the fleeing Argonauts. Nor does she mention her role as a practitioner of the magical arts of the chthonic goddess, Hecate, whom she re- veres above all gods. Although Medea may not literally be a witch, she clearly has a sophisticated knowledge of poisons, as well as of fertility potions, and can command the services of dragons. Other playwrights had, of course, written plays with strong female protagonists— even protagonists who, like Medea, committed crimes (Clytemnestra, for example). But those women eventually paid the price for their crimes, whereas Medea escapes punishment. In fact, she escapes to Athens, where King Aegeus gives her refuge (Fig- ure 17-1) (a fact that Euripides stresses, taking a jab at the Athenian audience, whose attitudes toward women were much like Jason’s, and perhaps warning them of the dangers of their views). Further, heroines like Clytemnestra performed their murders according to convention, decorously offstage, describing the result but not dwelling on the techniques; Medea’s poisoning of the princess, in contrast, is described in all its gory detail. A Proletarian Perspective Before we can decide whether Medea is a hero or a monster, Euripides shifts the viewpoint yet again, revealing still another unusual perspective. Unlike the essentially aristocratic focus on the noble protagonists in other tragedies of the time, in Eu- ripides’ plays, the voice of the common people often represents the most legitimate or compelling vision. In the Medea, the most sensible voices are those of the tutor, the nurse, and the chorus of Medea’s neighbors—ordinary women of Corinth who sympathize with her predicament as a woman (indeed, what woman could fail to identify with such statements as “I had rather fight three battles than bear one child”?) and who share her hatred of Jason. In fact, they become co-conspirators who, knowing of Medea’s plans, neither intervene nor report the danger. But even they, who are willing to go so far as to make themselves accessories to murder, draw the"},{"pageNumber":833,"pageContent":"Euripides ’ 7 97 FIGURE 17-1 Medea and Aegeus.

He accepts her offer, thus enabling Medea to proceed with her planned murders. (Vatican Museums, Rome) line at attacking the children. They are capable of moral distinctions: Jason deserves punishment; the children do not. Medea is capable only of rage that lashes out, when she is angered, at whatever she sees: “May it be an enemy and not a friend she hurts,” says the nurse, implying that either is possible. Once again, such unfocused rage is entirely within the heroic tradition, as when Aias, angered over his failure to win Achilles’ armor, tries to kill the Greek soldiers in their sleep; when intercepted by Athene, he vents his rage on the horses and cattle instead. In explicit statements as well, the nurse comments on the perversity of a self- indulgent upper class that, like the warrior-heroes who represent its highest aspira- tions, does not have to be answerable to its neighbors. “Great people,” she observes, tend to be excessive, vindictive, and violent tempered, and when they fall, their ruin is that much more complete. “What is moderate is best,” she concludes. On the surface, her advocacy of moderation may seem to resemble that of the chorus in Sophocles’ Oedipus Rex, where it applied to not asking too many questions or to not insisting on pursuing ideas to their logical conclusions. For Sophocles’ chorus."},{"pageNumber":834,"pageContent":"798 Myths of the Tragic Heroes and Heroines adhering to “what is moderate” is a way of avoiding trouble, of keeping a low profile, suitable to people who lack the courage of heroes. In Euripides’ play, the women of the chorus are much more independent and aggressive. And the moderation that the nurse recommends applies not to knowledge but to behavior; what she advocates is not cowardice or passivity but self-control. The Tra gic Hero Revisited Medea and Jason, of course, are “great people”: Medea is the daughter of the king of Colchis, and Jason is the rightful heir to the kingdom of lolcos and the hero of the Argonauts. The fact that they are without the status that derives from owning prop- erty, a situation referred to frequently in the play, is a reminder of the connection between power and territory. Having no place where they belong, these “important people” still behave as if power is theirs; but it isn’t. The fact is, they are both dispos- sessed—Jason by political usurpation, Medea by marriage and exile. And we see them in action not through the idealized medium of myth—of epic quests and extraordi- nary feats of courage and skill—but back at home, close up. If we see “heroes” here, we see them as they really are, behind their public masks; and instead of a domestic quarrel presented as high tragedy (as in Aeschylus’s Agamemnon), we have domestic drama presented on its own terms. In the fate of these “displaced” persons, we confront the displacement of an entire class structure: the feudal society in which the warrior-hero and the landed aristocrat were interchangeable has long since become, except in the still-revered ancient myths, an anachronism. Agamemnon and Clytemnestra argued about pride and its relation- ship to human morality and the gods, while Oedipus and Jocasta discussed fate and free will. But Jason and Medea argue about where the money is coming from, whose fault the divorce is, who started the quarrels, and who gets custody of the kids. When Medea kills their two sons rather than allow Jason to take possession of them, we feel we are on all-too-familiar territory. We see the headlines all the time: “Mother of Two, Distraught over Divorce and Loss of Custody Battle, Poisons Ex-Husband’s New Flame, Kills Children.” Seen close up, heroes suddenly look more like ordinary people. Of the two, it is clearly Medea who comes closest to the conventional tragic pro- tagonist of the Greek dramas. It is she who suffers; she who feels guilt for the death of the children (even as she plans their death); she who is carried away by an irresist- ible tide of passionate hatred, as she had earlier been by the irrational power of pas- sionate love; she who has the courage to acknowledge her deeds; and she who, in typical heroic fashion, much like Oedipus, refuses to compromise. Jason The great Jason, who not only acquired his reputation but, indeed, survived only with Medea’s help, will not acknowledge his complicity in the crimes she had com- mitted on his behalf and so is revealed as a lying coward, using women for his own gain—first Medea and now the princess. He offers to console Medea with the com- ment that, after all, she’s better off now since she lives in Greece instead of among"},{"pageNumber":835,"pageContent":"Euripides’y[tA& 2 i 799 barbarians” (another of Euripides’ sarcastic references to the Athenians’ snobbery). And, while it is true that Medea’s role as “foreigner” is increasingly emphasized throughout the play, it is clear, in context, that Jason is making yet another excuse for his own self-serving behavior. Jason’s pitiful argument reaches a low point of il- logic when he asserts that it would be better if men could have children on their own and women did not exist! The predicted death of Jason is the final nontragic point in what has been a mock- ery of the heroic life. He will die not on the battlefield nor in pursuit of some great revelation; rather, he will be struck on the head by a rotten beam as he sleeps under the prow of his ship—a fittingly ignominious death. Euripides Indictment o f Trd gic Violence In traditional tragedies, like those of Aeschylus and Sophocles, important people commit appalling deeds; they go mad; they kill their husbands, mothers, or children; they commit incest. And because they do so, ostensibly in pursuit of justice or free- dom or integrity, their passions—and their violence—are portrayed nobly. “This is my deed, and I claim it,” boasts Clytemnestra of her murder of Agamemnon, re- enacting the heroic stand that the heroes of the Iliad made over the corpses of their foes. And Orestes, in Aeschylus’s Oresteia, kills his mother with far less hesitation than Medea shows in killing her children. But while Aeschylus brings in Pylades to utter his one line, telling Orestes, in effect, “Do it,” and thus justifying Orestes’ act, Euripides has the chorus express their revulsion for Medea’s murder of her children, which reinforces our own horror at her deed. Thus, while Aeschylus allows us to see Orestes as a noble individual trapped, through no fault of his own, in an unfortunate predicament, Euripides forces us to confront the inhuman brutality of the act. Further, in Aeschylus’s plays, we do not get to see the vomiting of blood, the guts spilling out on the floor, the writhing of the corpse. And perhaps because we are not forced to watch the violent acts, it is easy for us to go along with the illusion that such deeds can be somehow ennobling. Euripides, however, stops us short. Forbidden to literally enact violence on the stage, he gets around the restriction by a prolonged description of the details of the princess’s death, forcing us to see, however much we might sympathize with Medea in her predicament, how truly revolting and immoral such behavior really is. If Jason the Argonaut has become Jason the hypocritical cow- ard, so Medea the wronged woman has become Medea the psychotic housewife who enjoys hearing the horror of her deeds described. Violence, far from being ennobling or transforming, far from precipitating some kind of tragic insight into oneself, as was the case with heroes like Oedipus, produces only the sadistic relishing of the deeds. Heroes are special, convinced by their divine ancestry and their unique drives and accomplishments that they are not bound by the limits that confine the rest of us. It is perfectly logical to assume, as both Jason and Medea do in this play, that somehow their needs reflect the gods’ will and that they are free to enact their desires, however extreme. If these people are what heroes are like and these deeds are what heroes do, then perhaps we would do better to reserve our admiration for the tutors, the nurses, the village girls, and the peasants, who are the only rational or moral characters in many of Euripides’ plays."},{"pageNumber":836,"pageContent":"800 Myths of the Tragic Heroes and Heroines The Trd gic Universe Parodied Tragedies typically take place in an unpredictable universe in which the gods do not inevitably return good for good and evil for evil; hence the suffering of the tragic protagonist is usually disproportionate to whatever sins he might have committed or mistakes he might have made. Euripides turns this universe on its head and explores its underside: if the good can suffer, the converse is that the wicked can prosper. At the end of Euripides’ version of Electra, for example, Orestes’ acquittal is guaran- teed in advance even though he stabbed Aegisthus in the back; further, Electra, who in this version slays her mother with her own hand, gets to marry Orestes’ friend Pylades and, presumably, live happily ever after, while the self-sacrificing peasant who aided and protected her is bought off with a few coins and dismissed. The Athenian audience was fond of parody, although it was usually associated with comedy. In fact, Euripides was himself parodied in Aristophanes’ comedies the Frogs and Thesmophoriazusae. To incorporate parody in a tragedy, however, was more unusual. One scene in Euripides’ Electra makes clear the playwright’s intentional parody of his fellow tragic dramatists—in this case, the recognition scene in Aeschy- lus’s the Libation-Bearers (see Chapter 15). In Euripides’ play, Electra asks whether a man would still wear the same size shirt he wore as a boy; whether the color of his hair, surely shared by many, is of any use as an identifying clue; and whether a man’s footprint is likely to be the same size as his sister’s. Poking fun at the absurdities of Aeschylus’s version of the story, Euripides reveals the parodic (and more realistic) elements of his own. The Medea, too, though it does not mock any specific play, seems to ask us to reconsider the traditional tragic vision that is still rooted in the glorious heroic val- ues of the ancient myths. In that mockery, the playwright undermines its characters, its actions, and its social, sexual, and moral premises. The “excessive” quality that seemed decadent to some of Euripides’ more conservative contemporaries may, in fact, be the instrument of a radical revisionist taking a new look at an old story. The Play’s Conclusion And so it is with Medea. We last see her on the roof of her home, about to fly off with the bodies of her children in a chariot drawn by dragons (Figure 17.2). Her “punishment” is to escape to Athens, where she will be supported and protected by the king. In the play’s final speech—one that was apparently so compelling to Eu- ripides that he used it again in the final passage of the Bacchae —the chorus com- ments on the unpredictable nature (the unreliability) of the gods: what we counted on is not what actually happened; the gods are not answerable to us and do not run the universe according to our needs or expectations. In the Odyssey, when Odysseus prepares to fight the suitors, Zeus gives a sign, a crack of thunder overhead, as a warning to the suitors and as a reminder that his will is being carried out. In the last scene of the Medea, Jason calls, as he has before, on the gods, asking for a sign, but fruitlessly: Medea gloats that no god will respond to him, an oath-breaker. But neither do the gods provide Medea with such symbolic sanctions. Jason lives, and he will die in a humiliating incident, the very sort of un- heroic death that Achilles and Odysseus most feared—the prosaic death of a failure, not a hero.

Is this vehicle, like Odysseus’s bow or Achilles’ shield, one of the special attributes of heroes, or did the chariot appear at that mo- ment, a special dispensation to reward her behavior? Either way, Medea has powers beyond those of ordinary mortals. She drives the chariot of the Sun and commands its dragons. Nor does Medea, unlike Phaethon, find that task beyond her power. She has, as well, the power of life (as she gave the old king, Aegeus, the gift of fertility)."},{"pageNumber":838,"pageContent":"802 Myths of the Tragic Heroes and Heroines of death, and possibly even of rebirth, a skill alluded to when, according to some versions of the myth, she instructs the daughters of Jason’s wicked uncle Pelias to kill their father. She tells them to place the dismembered pieces of his corpse into a cauldron that supposedly will bring about his regeneration—a mockery of ancient sparagmos rituals. Medea had, to demonstrate the procedure, killed, cooked, and resurrected a ram in the same cauldron. In fact, Medea’s powers recall those of the ancient Great Goddess herself. No wonder, in this thoroughly patriarchal society, that she is depicted as a witch! Further, the deity Medea has appealed to most frequently is Hecate, the dread triple goddess (sometimes depicted as having three heads) of the Underworld. (Medea invokes Zeus only in his role as oath-keeper, not as guardian of moral values such as family love—how could she, who kills her own children.) And neither Helios nor Hecate, as some scholars have pointed out, had local cults in Athens and so would have appeared exotic, somewhat “foreign” gods to the Athenian audience, as strange (and “barbaric”) as Medea herself must have seemed. Perhaps, when Medea taunted Jason with the notion that he thinks the “old gods” no longer prevail, she meant not “traditional” gods but an older generation of gods— more elemental, more primitive, from the Athenian view. If such bizarre and unfamil- iar gods indeed now have the upper hand and heroes like Jason, beloved in ancient myth, are denigrated, then truly, as the chorus remarks, “the world’s great order is reversed.” Not only has a woman, conventionally thought to be too helpless to plot and carry out such deeds, assumed the active, heroic role in this drama, but the usual gods, despite the expectations of both Jason and Medea, seem to have “ceased to rule” as enforcers of moral law. If that is so, then what is to stop Medea, strong, clever, and daring, from escaping divine as well as human retribution? If strange, even chthonic gods like Hecate are truly supporting Medea (as would be appropriate for a woman who has been driven by the irrational passions of love and hate), then it is the law of vengeance they enforce, along with the implacable inviolability of oaths. We are thrust back into an amoral universe such as the one the Furies tried, unsuccessfully, to maintain in Aeschylus’s Oresteia. There, they were displaced, for the moment, by a new world order based on compassion and justice. In the Medea, we seem to be back in a world where powerful, natural, but irrational forces prevail and human concepts like family love and justice are easily abrogated. And although Medea seems to recapitulate the powers of the primordial Goddess, she has clearly perverted them, under the pressures of an oppressive social structure, to unnatural uses. Athens was a city ostensibly devoted to freedom and equality, but Athens op- pressed its women just as Jason did. The city was, further, presently involved in what would end up being a mutually destructive war with the militaristic, old-style heroes of Sparta. Perhaps presenting the Athenian audience with the spectacle of a world gone mad, given over to irrational passions, in which order and justice could no longer be counted on (if they ever could), was not as unrealistic as its fantastic details, taken out of context, might suggest. Perhaps in such a world, a dramatic vision of a world turned upside down was entirely appropriate."},{"pageNumber":839,"pageContent":"MEDEA Euripides CHARACTERS NURSE to Medea TUTOR to Medea's children CHILDREN, the two SOUS ofMedea and Jason CHORUS of Corinthian women MEDEA CREON, king of Corinth JASON AEGEUS, king of Athens MESSENGER Soldiers, servants, and attendants [The action takes place before the house T?/MEDEA in Corinth, MEDEA J old NURSE is standing at the door.] Nurse If only Argo s hull had never flown i Between the Clashing Rocks to Colchis’ shore.

They especially admired Greek mythology, add- ing it to their own myths, such as the myth of the founding of Rome. They changed the Greek names and adapted the stories to fit their own concepts and values in four major ways: shifting their emphasis to reflect Roman views on what was important, attaching the stories to historical events and individuals, orienting them toward their overriding concern with the state of Rome, and reinterpreting them to reflect Roman ideas. The Connection between Greek and Roman Myths Like much of Roman culture, Roman mythology is eclectic, including both indige- nous material and myths and symbols borrowed from neighboring peoples, especially from the Etruscans, who had dominated the region before the Romans rebelled and founded their own republic (509 B.C.), and, of course, from the Greeks. From the Etruscans, the Romans borrowed the names of several of their gods (such as Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, whom the Romans identified with the Greek gods Zeus, Hera, and Athene), animal symbols (such as the she-wolf; Figure 18-1), and many rituals and superstitions. The Etruscans had already begun the process of urbanization, em- barking on projects such as public buildings and drainage systems that the Romans would continue and expand. The Romans were also influenced by Etruscan gover- nance and lifestyles. For example, although they would eventually reject monarchy, the Romans retained the Senate as an assembly of the heads of aristocratic families. And upper-class Etruscan women, who were more educated and less restricted than their Greek counterparts, and who were even permitted to dine on couches with their 845"},{"pageNumber":882,"pageContent":"846 The World of Roman Myth FIGURE 18-1 The She-Wolf of Rome. To this late-sixth- or early-fifth-century Etruscan bronze, the Roman sculptor added the twins Romulus and Remus, legendary founders of Rome. (The twins here are Renaissance reconstructions of the Roman originals, which were destroyed.) The Romans not only seized the sculpture and brought it to Rome but added to it representations of the myth of the founding of their state, thus making it figuratively as well as literally their own. This sculpture thus provides a visual image of the eclectic nature of Roman culture. (Conservatori Museum, Rome) husbands while entertaining guests (a practice Greek commentators found scandal- ous), also set the model for Roman women who, by the late Republic, were permitted the same freedoms. Both Romans and Etruscans were influenced by the Greeks, who had established colonies in Sicily and southern Italy as early as the eighth century B.C., exchanging with their neighbors not only goods and services but also elements of their culture and, of course, their alphabet, which both the Etruscans and the Romans adapted to the needs of their respective languages. The Romans were thus influenced by the Greeks both directly, interacting with the Greeks themselves, and indirectly, through the Etruscans, long before they conquered Greece in 146 B.C., bringing back Greek statues to set up in their gardens. The Romans particularly admired the Greeks, borrowing their myths and incor- porating many other aspects of Greek culture into their own. “I found Rome a city of brick,” the first Roman emperor, Augustus, is said to have boasted, “but I left it a city of marble.” Augustus’s statement reflects the Roman perception of both the cultural status and the beauty of Greek public architecture, with its elegant marble temples and harmonious design, as contrasted with the solid, practical brick of Ro- man buildings. Despite his boast, however, Augustus did not order that Rome be demolished and reconstructed in solid marble; nor could the large buildings required for a city the size of Rome have been safely constructed on the post-and-lintel system preferred by the Greeks. Rather, to make Rome resemble a Greek city while still addressing practical needs, Roman architects continued designing brick buildings"},{"pageNumber":883,"pageContent":"The Roman Vision 847 FIGURE 18-2 The Pantheon. A feat of engineering unprecedented in its time, the Pan- theon, a temple to all the Roman gods (Rome, c. A.D. 120), enclosed a huge interior space spanned by an enormous dome. The central structure, however, was not permitted to stand on its own merits: rather, the architect added a “Greek” facade—a portico (porch) that cre- ates the illusion of a classical Greek temple, complete with pillars that support only the roof of the porch itself. supported by sturdy Roman arches that they overlaid with a veneer of marble tiles and decorated with marble “columns” (which supported nothing), sculpted onto the exterior walls, often adding a mock Greek portico (porch) at the entrance (Fig- ure 18-2). Beneath the facade of Augustus’s “city of marble,” of course, Rome was still Rome. His metaphor, however, might equally serve to describe the relationship between Greek and Roman mythology. Although justifiably proud of their own skills at orga- nization, engineering, and government, the Romans imagined themselves inferior to the Greeks in terms of literary and artistic achievements. They had adopted Greek literature (educating their children, for example, on Homer’s works) and Greek my- thology, keeping the stories intact to maintain the veneer of Greek culture but chang- ing the names and adapting the concepts to fit their own core of Roman ideas and values. They also created links between the Greek myths they borrowed and existing Roman myths. In fact, it is largely through the works of Roman writers such as Virgil and Ovid (see Ghapters 19 and 20) that the cumulative body of classical mythol- ogy— reinterpreted in characteristically Roman ways—was in turn transmitted to later periods of Western culture (see Ghapter 21)."},{"pageNumber":884,"pageContent":"848 The World of Roman Myth A Roman Myth: Romulus and Remus The most important Roman myth was probably the story of Romulus and Remus and the founding of Rome. According to this myth, Rhea Silvia [REE-a SIL-vih-a] (or, in some variants. Ilia) was assigned to the office of Vestal Virgin by her wicked uncle Amulius, who had usurped the throne of her father, Numitor; because the Vestal Virgins, who guarded the Eternal Flame sacred to the Vesta, were required to remain celibate until age forty, Amulius hoped to prevent his niece from pro- ducing heirs, who would contest his claim to the throne. But, seduced by the god Mars, she bore twin sons, Romulus and Remus. Determined to exterminate the line, Amulius left the infants to die in a basket on the river Tiber. Washed up safely on shore, of course, the twins survived and were nursed by a she-wolf (originally an Etruscan symbol) and fed bits of food by a bird until they were found and raised by a shepherd. Growing to manhood, they discovered their real identities and, aided by loyal shepherds, restored their grandfather Numitor to the throne of his city. Alba Longa. The brothers, however, wanted a city of their own and argued over which one of them to name the city after. To settle the quarrel, they agreed to a contest: the winner would be the first one to see a sign from the gods—a flock of vultures. Remus first saw six, but Romulus, immediately afterward, saw twelve, which he claimed was a more powerful sign, albeit a later one. Supported by their respective followers, they fought, and Remus was killed. (Or perhaps, as variant suggests, Romulus killed him for defiantly jumping over a wall Romulus had built around the perimeter of his new city, marked out with a plow.) The city thus founded was named Rome —conceived according to a policy of aggressive expansion enforced by violence and as part of a divine plan. The Rape of the Sabine Women The new city prospered, but the shepherds-turned-warriors and the other men (often fugitives or escaped slaves) who joined them lacked marriageable women, people in the surrounding towns being understandably unwilling to marry their daughters to such aggressive intruders. (Or perhaps the Romans wanted to form a link with their neighbors, the Sabines [SAY-binz], in order to annex their territory and secure it permanently.) Romulus prepared a festival and invited the residents of neighboring communities, including the Sabines. When the guests were assembled, the Romans forcibly abducted and raped the daughters of the Sabines and, refusing to return their captives, married them. For several years, the Sabines warred against the Romans, until the Romans’ wives themselves interfered to assure their families that they were happy to be Roman wives. The Roman and Sabine territories were then combined under a single (ultimately Roman) government. Romulus ruled, with support from commoners and soldiers, for thirty-eight years until, during a storm, he suddenly vanished in a dark cloud. Some suspected that resentful patrician senators had killed and dismembered him, but he was officially said, by the senators who witnessed the incident, to have been taken up to the heavens to be henceforth worshiped as the warrior god Quirinus."},{"pageNumber":885,"pageContent":"The Roman Vision 849 The Lupercalia The origins of the Romulus and Remus myth are lost in history, but modern scholars have suggested several possible interpretations. The twins may be related, for example, to the Lares [LAR-eez], guardians of the spirit of the home who also became guard- ians of the state. The story of Romulus and Remus is also closely connected with the Feast of the Lupercalia, in honor of the god Faunus, or Pan (both associated with shepherds), a ritual the twins are credited with founding. They are said to have run completely around their village, prior to the discovery of their true identities, either naked or dressed only in a loincloth made of the hide of sacrificial goats (suggesting an even more ancient initiation rite), thus chartering the official Roman ritual. Each year on February 15, two young aristocrats chosen for the honor, the Luperci, sacri- ficed two goats in a cave named for the she-wolf {lupa) said to have suckled the twins. The youths were pricked by the sacrificial knife, and the blood was then washed off with wool soaked in milk. After engaging in games and feasting on the cooked meat, the Luperci would cut strips from the goat hides, and run around the base of the Palatine (one of the seven hills of Rome), whipping anyone they could with the thongs. After a plague of miscarriages and stillbirths in Rome in 296 B.C., the ritual ac- quired a new function—ensuring women’s fertility. According to Ovid, who places his story during the time of Romulus, widespread infertility became a problem among the Sabine women, who were told by Juno, in her role as Lucina, moon goddess and goddess of childbirth, that in order to conceive they must be impreg- nated by a sacred goat. Ovid attributes the explanation of Juno’s will to an Etruscan augur. Thus, women who wanted to conceive presented themselves at the Lupercalia to be whipped by the goat thongs, thereby resolving the fertility problem. From that point on, the Feast of the Lupercalia included the flagellation of women who offered themselves up. Whatever the Romans may have borrowed or adapted from Greek mythology, the indigenous myth of Romulus and Remus and the foundation of a city that would be both secure in its walls and prosperous in its fertility—of its fields, flocks, and women—remained so compelling that the emperor Octavian considered choosing the name “Romulus” for himself before settling on “Augustus.” In this way, he avoided any reminder of the centuries-old division between brothers that might recall the civil war from which Rome had just emerged in 30 B.C. The Characteristics of Roman Myth The Focus on the City and Its History The myth of Romulus and Remus and the founding of Rome reveals quintessentially Roman elements. First, it is focused on the city and its process of expansion from a mere plot of ground to an empire in progress, beginning with the Sabine territories, while nostalgically attesting to its roots among simple shepherds. Second, although the myth begins with strong mythic components (Mars and the she-wolf), it swiftly turns to the actual history of Roman expansion into the rest of Italy."},{"pageNumber":886,"pageContent":"850 The World of Roman Myth The Patriarchal Perspective Third, the myth s perspective is intensely patriarchal, entirely appropriate to a society in which the pater familias, the male head of the extended family, had literally the power of life and death over the family members. Determined to father children, the original inhabitants of Rome as depicted in the foundation myth have no qualms about raping the Sabine women, thereby reenacting the original rape of Rhea Silvia by Mars. Greek myths, of course, are also largely patriarchal. But we can usually perceive in them some vestige of ambivalence, some trace of the feminine powers in the symbols whose meanings lurk beneath the surface or literally lie in wait behind it. That the rape of the Sabine women is approved by the gods and, more revealingly, by the women themselves demonstrates both the total subservience of women in this myth and the myth’s complete obliteration of the female perspective. There are, of course, many instances of rape in Greek myths as well. And in the Roman poet Ovid’s Metamorphoses (see Chapter 20), as in the Greek myths on which they are based, rapes are not portrayed approvingly. Nevertheless, it is instructive to contrast the myth of the Sabine women with a depiction of rape in Greek mythology. The abduction of Helen—along with Paris’s violation of the guest-host relationship and the laws of marriage that preceded it—is treated as a violation of principles sacred to the gods, and the war that follows leads to the destruction, not the expansion, of Troy. Even more revealing is the contrast with the Greek myth of the centaurs’ at- tempted rape of the Lapith women at the wedding of the Lapith princess: whereas the centaurs are reviled and driven off by the Greeks for their savage, irrational be- havior, for the same actions the Romans are rewarded with wives, land, and divine approval. The Demythologizing Tendency Finally, we can see in the Romulus and Remus story the strong resistance to its more fantastic components by contrasting the story of this city founded in violence with the Greek myth of the founding of Thebes. In the Greek myth, Cadmus sows drag- on’s teeth, which magically grow into a race of armed men. The armed men of Rome, however, arrive in a more pedestrian fashion—as disgruntled farmers and shepherds, runaway slaves, and fugitives from justice. And to propagate their race, they require the services not of dragons but of women. The Greek writer Plutarch (A.D. 46—120), whose Lives compared figures from Greek and Roman myth and history, would surely have felt compelled, in his role as biographer and historian, to offer an alter- native (and more realistic) explanation of the “divine conception” of the twins; nev- ertheless, his tome serves to illustrate the demythologizing impulse frequently at work in Roman myths. According to Plutarch, the story of the rape of Rhea Silvia by the war god was probably planted as a cover-up to a more likely scenario—a rape by her uncle Amulius. Plutarch’s demythologizing tendency is likewise illustrated in his ver- sion of the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur: Pasiphae, he asserted, was in love not with a bull {taurus, in Greek) but with a captain of the king’s guard named Taurus, who lost an athletic contest to Theseus. Similarly, he stated that Theseus went not to the Underworld but to a land governed by a king who happened to be named Pluto, who had a wife named Persephone and a dog named Cerberus. Heracles,"},{"pageNumber":887,"pageContent":"The Roman Vision 851 according to Plutarch, rescued Theseus from the dog! In a similar vein, the poet Horace, in one of his odes (Book 3, Number 16), described Zeus as coming to Per- seus s mother, Danae, safely locked in her tower, in a shower of gold, but equated the gold with bribery—which can always break down barriers. While such ‘ rationalistic” explanations of mythic materials were not unknown in the work of earlier writers about Greek myth, they are for the Romans consistent with a widespread sense of pride in their own pragmatic nature. The Romans wanted their myths, but without having to relinquish their sense of themselves as realistic, practical men of the world. The Links between Greek and Roman Mythology The myth of the founding of Rome, however, would not have been as satisfying had the Romans not been able to forge, in both senses of the word, a link between it and Greek mythology. In fact, the “Greek connection” was so intriguing to the Romans that there are several mythic versions of the ancestral link between the two popula- tions. According to Hesiod, for example, Odysseus fathered two sons by Girce, whom Hesiod portrays as an Etruscan goddess. One of those sons. Latinos, may have been an eponymous ruler of the Etruscans. The Romulus and Remus story, however, was the “official” version of the linkage. Thus, not only is Romulus a son of Mars (the Roman name for the Greek god Ares), but his mother is descended from Ascanius [as-KAY-nih-uhs], son of Aeneas [ee-NEE-as], the only Trojan hero to escape the destruction of Troy. The “missing” descendants of Troy are thereby accounted for— they are Romans! And although the Trojans were not exactly Greek, they were, in effect, honorary Greeks by virtue of being featured in Homers Iliad. Moreover, because Aeneas is the son of the goddess Aphrodite (whom the Romans renamed Venus), he is in any case half-Greek. Like Augustus’s “marble city,” these links be- tween Greek and Roman myths satisfied the Romans’ desire to be Greek without having to give up being Roman. Roman Transformations o Greek Myths The Romans went beyond merely creating a Greek connection to their own myths. They actually adopted the entire body of Greek mythology, identifying the Greek gods with their own indigenous deities, an appealing correspondence since both often share the same Near-Eastern sources or, further back, Indo-European roots. Both Zeus and Jupiter, for example, are derived from the ancient Indo-European Dayaus- Pitar (god the father). Thus, the Greek gods would not have seemed at all “foreign” to the Romans, who eagerly incorporated the Greek narratives as, in effect, additional information about their own deities. But they did not borrow mindlessly or in passive imitation. Rather, they changed as they borrowed, transforming Greek mythology in four characteristic ways: (1) they refocused the myths, redefining the characters of the gods and shifting the emphasis to those they considered especially important; (2) they historicized the myths, attaching them to real events and individuals in Roman his- tory; (3) they politicized the myths, making them serve the needs of the Roman state; and (4) they reinterpreted the myths to reflect Roman ideas and values."},{"pageNumber":888,"pageContent":"852 The World of Roman Myth FIGURE 18-3 Jupiter. The Roman version of the Greek god Zeus, Jupi- ter adds a political dimension to the gods’ domain. Bearing the Roman ea- gle at the end of his scepter, Jupiter is presented in this sculpture as a divine emblem of imperial power and a guarantor of its eternal dominion. (Vatican Museums, Rome) The Refocusing of Myth: Greek versus Roman Gods The Greek pantheon is dominated by the figures of Zeus and Fiera, along with Athene—the wisdom of Zeus—and Apollo, who likewise comes to embody enlight- enment and the wisdom of self-knowledge and self-control. For the Romans, how- ever, abstractions like wisdom and introspective pursuits of self-awareness were, though certainly important, clearly less pressing concerns than were practical prob- lems like managing the grain supply to feed an enormous and growing popula- tion. Thus, in the Roman pantheon, although the main figures are still Jupiter and Juno (Figures 18-3 and 18-4—Roman equivalents of Zeus and Fiera), Apollo and Minerva (the Roman counterpart of Athene) occupy a less central position, while Ceres [SEE-reez] (from whose name we derive the word cerealdind who is the Roman version of Demeter, goddess of grain) becomes correspondingly more important. Similarly, Fdestia, the Greek goddess of the hearth (the cooking fire), was mentioned only infrequently in Greek myths. Fdestia’s Roman counterpart, the native Roman goddess Vesta, however, was worshiped not only in every Roman home but in a public temple served by the Vestal Virgins, where a sacred fire that they kept always burning became the central symbol of Eternal Rome. A similar shift of emphasis is illustrated in the changing attitude toward the war god. Although they admired their warrior-heroes, sometimes even making gods of them, the Greeks exalted Athene as goddess of the defensive war that saved the city"},{"pageNumber":889,"pageContent":"The Roman Vision 853 FIGURE 18-4 Juno, Queen of Heaven (also known as Hera Barberini). In this fifth-century- B.c. sculpture, Juno (the Roman equivalent of the Greek goddess Hera) is portrayed as a figure of royal bearing, reflecting the dignity of her po- sition as the most powerful Roman goddess. Like Jupiter, she is associated with the stability of the Roman state. (Vatican Museums, Rome) but were somewhat ambivalent about Ares, the god of offensive war, whom they sometimes portrayed as two-faced and violent and not very bright. Clearly, for a nation with imperial ambitions, such a portrayal would not do. In fact, the Romans, although seeing themselves as bringers of peace, proudly traced their ancestry to the war god Mars (Figure 18-5). Possibly originating as an agricultural deity, Mars was portrayed as an implacable god whose purpose was to inspire the Roman legions to victory. The Historicizing of Myth In addition to shifting the focus of the myths and redefining the gods accordingly, the Romans, intensely proud of their own history, insisted on historicizing the myths. Greek myths, too, are often loosely based on historical events. The Troy saga, for instance, undoubtedly has some basis in a war or series of wars between the Greeks and Trojans, whose city was strategically located at the entrance to the Dardanelles; and the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur may reflect in a general way the shift of power from Crete to the mainland and the end of the colonial status of the Greek city-states. But the Romans were more precise and insistent about the historiciz- ing process, tying the myths whenever possible to real names, dates, places, and events. Plutarch, for example, treated Romulus and Remus as historical, not mythi- cal, figures."},{"pageNumber":890,"pageContent":"854 The World of Roman Myth FIGURE 18-5 Mars.

In a typical Roman combination of mythol- ogy and actual history, the 128-foot-high marble column of Trajan (located in the Forum of Trajan, Rome, A.D. 106-113) depicts, in spiral bands over 4 feet high, the emperor Trajan’s two campaigns against the Dacians. In this detail near the base, the river god of the Danube supports the bridge—and hence the Roman enterprise—as columns of armored imperial troops cross safely over the Danube River. Portraits of Emperor Trajan occur frequently in the unfolding story told in the bas-reliefs. The figure of Jupiter also appears, supporting the Ro- man cause. The narrative culminates in the Romans’ victory, attended by the winged goddess of Victory herself. Unlike the relatively timeless world of Greek myths, Roman myths are often pre- cisely located in time and space and explained as realistically as possible. Whereas FJeracles may have explored the unknown regions of the mythical North and West, Romulus is much more interested in expanding Roman territory into adjacent Italian lands. Descended from the gods and FFomeric heroes on the mythical side, Romulus is also linked to history as the ancestor of Julius Caesar and his great-nephew, the emperor Augustus. Virgil explained the link: Ascanius, Aeneas’s son, was nicknamed Ilus, and by the simple addition of another vowel picked up over time, he became lulus; thus, he was deemed the progenitor of the family of Julii—as the family had indeed claimed since the third century B.C. —and hence of Julius Caesar. The family tree of flesh-and-blood contemporary Romans, rooted in the soil of mythology, sprouts real fruit. To the down-to-earth Roman sensibility, these historical links jus- tified the myths, even as the myths chartered real political claims. Indeed, by the fourth century B.C., several important Roman families traced their lineage to the Trojans.

In this marble statue (c. 20 B.C.), the emperor Augustus is portrayed as a Ro- man soldier directing his troops.

The facial expression, however, is unlike those calm, detached Greek images. In characteristic Roman fashion, Augustus’s ex- pression is serious, and he is clearly intent on the business at hand. He is accompanied by a small Cupid at his feet, the real and the mythic thus intersect- ing. The relative proportions and positions of the two figures seem to suggest that the real world in which Augustus actu- ally ruled predominates, while the subordinate mythic material provides a support system: the gods are on the side of Rome.

In a scene at the base describing the beginning of the campaign, the river god of the Danube supports the bridge over which the Roman legions pass. Amid realistic scenes of contemporary events of that war, in which the emperor figures prominently, Jupiter and the goddess Victory also appear. Such works, like the myths, reflect the Roman belief that art, to be useful, should instruct as well as delight. The more grounded in reality the myths were, the more they could perform their didactic func- tion, illuminating both historical and contemporary events."},{"pageNumber":893,"pageContent":"The Roman Vision 857 The Politicizing of Myth A famous Roman statue features an Apollo-like portrait of the emperor Augustus with a small Cupid —an agent of the goddess Venus—at his feet (Figure 18-7). If history justified the myths, the myths, in turn, were used to justify political realities: in this case, the imperial regime is granted a divine connection while private emotions (here. Love) are subordinated to duty to the state. In Roman religious practices, as in their myths, the same connection between private worship and public rites prevailed. For example, Romans in their homes typically worshiped three kinds of gods: the Lares, spirits (possibly ancestral) who guarded the family; the Penates [pe-NAY-teez], spirits of the pantry, who also pro- tected the house and especially its food supply; and the Vesta, goddess of the blazing hearth, where the meals were cooked. These domestic gods had their public counter- parts in the state gods Jupiter, Juno, and Ceres, who performed the same protective functions for the nation as the domestic gods did for the home. Thus, even in the domestic rituals of daily life, Romans ended up paying service to the gods of state and hence to the state itself. This link was further tied to political life when deceased emperors were deified and their spirits were said to have joined the other guardians of Rome. One scholar, T. P. Wiseman, speculates that the Romulus and Remus myth itself is a product of Roman politics. In the original version of the myth, he argues, there is a single eponymous founder, Romulus; the figure of Remus is not added until the late third century B.C., only to be killed off, in the myth, in reflection of the class division in ancient Rome. Remus, he says, represents the plebians (common people), who twice seceded from Rome and refused to serve in the military, while Romulus represents the patricians (aristocracy). The actual political rift was resolved through a series of legal reforms that granted the plebians a somewhat greater share of political power. The myth of Remus’s death, Wiseman claims, is perhaps a symbolic blood sacrifice to consecrate the foundation of the state. In fact, he suggests, human sacrifice to ensure the security of the city’s foundation walls may actually have been performed. For the Romans, in myths as in all aspects of their lives, all roads led to Rome. It is true, of course, that Greek myths were often used to express political ideas. Aeschylus’s Eumenides, for example, underwrites the Athenian court system; the Iliad surely comments on political values; and the spirit of Theseus was said to protect Athens. Nevertheless, the gods of the Greeks were not typically national- istic in their political aims. Although individual Greek localities had their resident deities (indeed, every stream or grove seems to have had its local nymph or god), the major gods, the Olympians, were not gods of specific places—of, say, Argos or Mycenae or Troy. Rather, they were the gods—of Trojans and of Greeks. Roman gods, on the other hand, were emphatically Roman. And although con- quest spread their worship to many lands, the gods themselves remained identified as gods of Rome, as gods who had a vested interest in Roman destiny. Thus, even Ovid, telling myths of adventure and love in the Metamorphoses, set the tales within the framework of Roman ambitions. Roman destiny, farther, was divinely pre- determined: the establishment and maintenance of Eternal Rome and the incorpo- ration of all the earth within its borders. This obsession with Rome was so pervasive that even writers who were skeptical of the “official” view of the state, its destiny, or"},{"pageNumber":894,"pageContent":"858 The World of Roman Myth its gods felt compelled nevertheless to discuss it or at least include it in their works. Rome was not a topic a Roman could simply ignore. The Myths Reinterpreted The use of myths to support these political aims required a major reinterpretation of the material inherited from the Greeks. Thus, the dynamic, open-ended, ambiguous, and often contradictory universe of the Greek myths gave way to a universe that was teleological—that is, directed in linear fashion toward a single, inevitable goal: the subjection of all the world to the rule of Roman gods and Roman law. Consequently, all acts that furthered that goal were deemed good; all that hindered it were necessarily evil. In Roman myth as in Roman c\\x\\tmt, pietas —duty to parents, gods, and state— and patriotism were inseparably linked. The Romans had witnessed, both historically and currently, what happens when governments are unprepared for external threats or vulnerable to the outbreak of civil wars. If they were to be truly bringers of peace (an aim that, to their credit, they more or less accomplished during the long period of the Pax Romana), they would need to be able to count on the commitment to duty and loyalty of the citizens of their empire. Patriotism was thus neither abstract nor sentimental—it was a survival tool. Service in the military and the discipline that made the Roman legions so successful likewise depended on the self-sacrifice and loyalty of Roman citizens. To worship and obey the gods of Rome, then, became an act of patriotism; conversely, defiance of the gods constituted both impiety and treason. (Historically, this attitude was reflected in the otherwise tolerant Romans’ antagonism toward groups like the Christians and Jews, who would accept Roman governors but refuse to worship their gods.) Further, events that seemed to have human causes were, when seen from the gods’ perspective (the big picture), revealed to be part of a divine plan. For the Greeks, the fall of Troy was more the consequence of choices made by a Paris, a Priam, or a Hector; for the Romans, Troy fell so that Rome could arise, and Aeneas had to go into exile so that the Romans could claim Trojan as well as Latin ancestry. In such a universe, there can ultimately be no tragedy—only history incompletely understood. The Roman Hero The ego-driven hero of Greek myth typically sets his ambiguous, divided nature against a confusing and contradictory world and succeeds by acquiring self- knowledge while maintaining his integrity. Such a hero, however, is far too concerned with his own needs and goals and far too prone, in his reckless pursuit of immortality, to commit antisocial acts to constitute a proper role model for Romans. Along with the powers of Mars and the territorial ambitions of Romulus, the Romans wanted their heroes to exemplify the ideal Roman soldier and citizen, adamant and unswerv- ing in championing the Roman way. For a state in which, unlike the Greek polis, we can see the beginnings of the modern nation-state where citizenship transcends tribal and regional loyalties, such dedication is mandatory. Three qualities nostalgically associated with the early republic are essential for the Roman hero: gravitas, or seriousness of purpose and devotion to duty (especially duty to the state); pietas, or duty to one’s parents, the state, and the gods of Rome; and"},{"pageNumber":895,"pageContent":"The Roman Vision 859 frugalitas, or the idealizing of the simple life, free from the distractions of vanity and self-indulgence. The proper Roman hero subordinates his own needs to those of the state he serves, accepts whatever burdens and sacrifices patriotic duty imposes on him, and does not ask to be rewarded. It is enough that Rome be immortal—sharing in the immortality of the state, he finds all the fulfillment he needs. Nor should the Roman hero indulge in the emotional excesses of his Greek coun- terparts— duty requires that he avoid giving way to passionate excesses of grief, anger, or rage. Certainly, the Romans admired the Greek hero myths and even perpetuated the cult of Hercules (the Latin name for Heracles), maintaining an altar to him (the Ara Maxima, or Greatest Altar) and claiming, as both Virgil and the Roman historian Livy attest, that Hercules passed through Rome while bringing the cattle of Geryon back from the Underworld. But for a Hercules or an Achilles to behave in Augustan Rome as these heroes sometimes did in Greek mythology would be considered out- rageous. Further, the Roman hero is not to invest such emotional energy in his own life that the prospect of his death becomes the one overwhelming fact determining his choices. Rather, he must recognize that his individual life occupies one brief in- stant in a long span of history. To become obsessed with his personal needs or private sufferings would perpetuate the illusion of egocentrism: in fact, neither his triumphs nor his tragedies matter, except insofar as they contribute to the ultimate goal—the triumph of Eternal Rome. Such heroes will, of course, be rewarded—but not in this life. For true patriots, Elysium awaits, in the Underworld, where worthy souls can sing, curry their horses, polish their chariots, and, of course (this being a Roman version of paradise), partake in the inevitable feast. Questions for Discussion and Review 1. The Romans, who were great admirers of Greek culture, borrowed Greek myths but altered them to reflect their own values and ideas. Describe at least two ways in which the Romans transformed Greek myths. 2. Contrast the rape of the Sabine women with the Greek myth in which the centaurs attempt to rape the Lapith women. What do these two myths suggest about the female perspective in the Roman and Greek cultures, respectively? How do Greek and Roman myths differ in their response to rape? 3. In what ways does Romulus reflect a specifically Roman concept of the hero? Consider his ancestry, his attitude toward the city and its role, and his self-image. 4. Explain how the Roman hero differs from his Greek counterpart. What qualities of a Hercules or an Achilles would a Roman admire? What aspects of their behavior might a Roman hero disapprove of?

After a series of adventures, including a year spent in Carthage as the consort of Queen Dido, he makes his way, commanded by Jupiter, to Italy. After a prolonged war there, he will marry a Latin princess and become the pro- genitor of the Romans. Although paying tribute to both the Odyssey and the Iliad, Virgil transforms Greek myths and heroes and presents a uniquely Roman epic with a uniquely Roman hero. Publius Vergilius Maro, known as Virgil (70-19 B.C.), was raised in Mantua on his fathers successful farm. Sent to Rome to complete his education, he witnessed in dismay the civil wars that began in 48 B.C., marking Romes painful transition from republic to empire. His own family farm was confiscated during that chaotic time. Determined that such disorder should not recur, Virgil supported the empire, seeing the emperor Augustus, its most visible symbol, as a restorer of peace and civil order. A careful poet, Virgil wrote slowly and revised his poems extensively. His work includes two groups of pastoral poems (the Eclogues and the Georgies) that nostalgi- cally idealize the peaceful simplicity of the rural life of farmers and shepherds. These works, highly appealing to the residents of a city characterized by the noise, crowds, traffic, and other tensions of urban life as we still know them, made Virgil the most popular poet of his time. 861"},{"pageNumber":898,"pageContent":"862 The World of Roman Myth Emperor Augustus himself encouraged and funded Virgil’s work on his epic poem, the Aeneid [ee-NEE-id], which he worked on for the last eleven years of his life. Not yet finished with his revisions, Virgil ordered the manuscript to be burned at his death, but Augustus prevented its destruction—and no wonder! Apart from his personal admiration for the poem, what better public relations device could an emperor imagine than to have the nation’s most honored poet describe the empire and its current ruler as divinely inspired? Whatever interpretations later readers might develop, it is clear that the emperor and his court found this work a most flattering tribute to both emperor and empire. The Aeneid Signijicant Themes and Characters The Greek Connection The characteristic Augustan desire to infuse a Roman work with an aura of classical Greece is manifested in the Aeneid in several ways. Determined to be the Roman Homer, Virgil set out to write in an elegant style, calculated to lift the Latin tongue from the prosaic language of everyday affairs to a self-consciously poetic vehicle with a cultural status equal to that of Greek—a foreign language that educated Romans would have learned as part of their formal schooling. In addition to asserting the genealogical link that makes Augustus into a descen- dant of the mythical Trojan Aeneas (see Chapter 18), Virgil frequently reminds his readers of the similarities between his epic and Homer’s. Not only does he adopt all the standard features of the Homeric epic, beginning with the invocation of the Muse, but he also draws explicit parallels between his work and Homer’s. The first six books of the Aeneid are carefully modeled on the Odyssey. The wanderings of a hero trying to get home, the search for a bride, the devotion of Aeneas to his son, the following of Odysseus’s route from Troy (so that Aeneas lands, for example, at the Cyclops’s cave just as Odysseus did), the danger of temptation by a woman who would keep him from his journey if she could, and other features—all point to the similarities between the two works. In Book 7, with a second invocation, Virgil shifts gears and, to describe his battle scenes, models the rest of the work on the Iliad. The parallels include the councils of the gods, their rivalries and interventions, the relationship between the hero and his divine mother, the gathering of the troops (including one army led by a woman), the death of the hero’s best friend at the hands of his rival, and other similar details. The Historicizing of Myth Despite the Greek veneer, however, the Aeneid is a thoroughly Roman poem. Like his contemporaries, Virgil was concerned with the historicizing of myth, linking the characters of the story with individual events and persons in Roman history. At sev- eral crucial points in the narrative, the poet has reliable characters (the god Jupiter, the hero’s father Anchises) recount the “history” of Rome, giving dates even to mythological events: Aeneas will rule Latium [LAY-shee-uhm] for three years; his son will rule for thirty years and build a new city at Alba Longa, which will be the capital for three hundred years until Romulus builds Rome itself The narration in-"},{"pageNumber":899,"pageContent":"The A&ntid 863 The World of Romdn History 753 B.c.

Similarly, Aeneas’s shield, forged for him by Vulcan (the Latin name for Hephaestus) as Achilles’ was, depicts contemporary Roman events, including the Battle of Actium (31 B.C.) between Marc Antony and Octavian (who shortly thereafter became Emperor Augustus). Another example of the linkage of myth and history occurs in the curse that Dido [DYE-doh] calls down on Aeneas when he abandons her. She calls for an “avenger” from Carthage who will make endless war on Rome, thus predicting both the series of Punic Wars that Rome fought with Carthage and the invasion of Rome during the second of those wars (218-201 B.C.) by the Carthaginian general Hannibal, who wreaked devastation from which the nation never fully recovered. (For a more com- plete chronology of the world of Roman history, see the box above.) The Role of the City The first role of the city, as described by Aeneas himself when he visits Carthage, is to create the conditions under which civilized life can flourish: to establish just laws and good government (the prerequisites for civic order and justice); to erect buildings and monuments; to encourage the arts, theater, trade, and commerce; and to enclose them all within walls that serve to mark off the city’s legal boundaries and to protect its inhabitants. The Romans’ concern with boundaries and"},{"pageNumber":900,"pageContent":"864 The World of Roman Myth barriers such as borders, ramparts, and walls, which was reflected in the earlier myth that describes Romulus marking oflF his territory with a plow, is evident throughout the Aeneid. Jupiter, for example, promises Venus that the walls of Rome will surely rise. When Aeneas first enters Carthage, he comments enviously on the happiness of those “whose walls already rise.” In fact, almost every mention of a city in the epic includes a reference to its walls, so that the walls come to stand for the entire city and the way of life and the people it contains. Although we don’t get to see Rome itself in the Aeneid, we do get to watch Car- thage under construction, a model for Aeneas to admire, until Dido (queen of Car- thage), caught up in her love affair with Aeneas, forgets her responsibilities; her ne- glect of duty is thus a warning to the would-be Roman. In this process, the appointed leader is in charge. If he or she neglects the task, the city will suffer: Carthage, as every Roman knew, was ultimately destroyed by Rome (146 B.C.). Troy, defending the self- indulgent Paris, was also destroyed. But it is not enough to create peace and order within one city’s borders and walls if there are enemies outside. Thus, the second role of the city is to spread its civiliza- tion, to “curb haughty nations by justice,” to “teach the ways of peace to those they conquer”—even if it must fight endless wars to do so. Like many well-intentioned modern nations, the peace-loving Romans apparently fought wars, which they hated, in order to create the conditions that would end the necessity for war. Although in recent years we have come to consider such acts and intentions as imperialist aggres- sion, in their own time the Romans’ vision of one world united under Roman aus- pices was not necessarily considered undesirable. Many lands actually welcomed the Romans who, along with their governors and their gods, brought the blessings of security, advanced technology (as they con- structed water and sanitation systems and built roads that still function today), an improved economy (as goods and services were traded), education (as young people from the colonies came to Roman universities to study), and opportunities both for Roman citizenship and for advancement in the vast Roman bureaucracy. Further, whenever possible, the Romans respected the cultures they absorbed, usually allowing the colonial peoples to maintain their own language, culture, and religion. The Roman Hero In the Iliad —the story of Troy—we met the hero Achilles in the opening lines of the poem; in the Odyssey, although we didn’t actually meet Odysseus until Book 5, we heard of him (and of the poet’s judgment of him) in the poem that opens the work. Not so in the Roman epic: the subject of the Aeneid —its real hero—is not a man but a city and the nation that shares its name. In the opening line, the poet announces his subject: “arms” and “a man.” Clearly, the “arms”—warfare—comes first, whereas the “man” remains anonymous for the first 130 lines of the poem. The focus on the city skews the portrayal of the human contenders in one very specific and exclusively Roman direction. In the Iliad, Hector and Achilles faced each other as equals, respecting each other’s worth and honor. But in the Aeneid, though Turnus is portrayed with considerable sympathy and though he and Aeneas are equally skilled and courageous, they are seen from the Roman perspective. That is, Aeneas is a patriot, but Turnus, who does what Aeneas does but on the wrong side."},{"pageNumber":901,"pageContent":"T’A^’Aeneid 865 is repeatedly described as “mad” and “fanatical”—an enemy to Rome and, as he explicitly states, to Jupiter. He is thus a foil to Aeneas in war, as Dido was in love. In the Iliad, Zeus respected and sympathized with both sides. In the Aeneid, there is no question about which is the good side: Turnus fights for personal glory, whereas Ae- neas fights for gods and country—for Rome. An exchange such as that between Hector and Ajax in the Iliad —Trojan and Greek fighting to a draw, proving their prowess, and exchanging gifts—is no longer possible. War is no longer a game fought for the glory of the players; war is now grim—and avoidable. If only Rome’s oppo- nents would do the sensible thing and yield peacefully to the inevitable, the “iron gates of war” would close forever. Until then, the kind of peace found in the Roman image of Arcadia as a peaceable kingdom of gardens and shepherds will remain a dream of the Golden Age long past (associated by the Romans with the “good old days” of the early republic) or of the life in Elysium to come. The persistence in Roman culture of nostalgia for the imagined simplicity of the past and the fondness of well-to-do Romans for keeping country villas for pastoral weekend retreats are expressed in these mythic images, perhaps representing an undercurrent of suspicion that the price paid for civilization—even (or perhaps especially) one as glorious as Rome’s—was too high. In return for their troubles, the Greek heroes received some kind of reward: Achil- les got his glory, and Odysseus his family and home. Meanwhile, the hero of the Aeneid will not even get to see the promised land for which he risks his life and sacrifices everything—his comfort, his home, his wife, his lover, his friends (includ- ing Palinarus, the helmsman, and the Arcadian prince Pallas himself), along with his freedom and his fortune. What kind of hero would sacrifice so much to gain so little? Aeneas: An Exemplary Roman Aeneas is presented from the beginning of the epic as a man “remarkable for good- ness,” who is nevertheless forced by the gods to bear the burden of being the founder of Rome. Achilles, offered two fates, chose to fight (and die) at Troy; Odysseus, de- spite many tempting alternatives offered to him, chose to go home to Ithaca, what- ever the risks. Aeneas, however, has no such choices. From the beginning, he is the victim of divine politics. So that Rome may come into being, Troy falls, and he is ordered by his mother, the goddess Venus, to flee to “Italy,” a region he’s never seen or even heard of. When he falls in love with Dido, he stays with her until Mercury orders him to leave: “You must set sail” is the message Mercury brings from Jupiter. For the Roman hero, unlike his Greek counterpart, his only choice is in the way he accepts his destiny. Why, the poet asks, would the gods impose such suffering on such a good man? Can the gods be malevolent? The answer, not stated explicitly until Aeneas’s visit to the Underworld in Book 6, is already implied in the opening dozen lines of the poem: it is for the good of Rome. Conscious of his responsibility to the gods, to his son, and to the future of Rome (if you won’t do it for yourself, his mother and Jupiter both ask him, would you deny your son the walls of Rome?), Aeneas accepts his burdens— despite his sorrow at the losses he has experienced—not only with the tranquillity that the Roman philosophers urged but with the kind of zeal, once he is committed, that characterized the Greek heroes’ pursuit of their own more personal goals. This"},{"pageNumber":902,"pageContent":"866 The World of Roman Myth contrast in the Greek and Roman heroes’ sense of their own identities is revealed even in the epithets attached to their names. For the Greek heroes, the epithets de- scribed personal skills or qualities—“wily Odysseus,” “swift-footed Achilles.” For Aeneas, however, the epithets describe moral commitments and responsibilities— “pious Aeneas,” “father Aeneas”—qualities so utterly given in his character that he can use them to describe himself: “I am pious Aeneas,” he says, introducing himself to Dido. As such, one of his burdens is quite literal: he is responsible for carrying the household gods of Troy—the Lares, the Penates, and the Vesta—to Rome, where they eventually will be established as the gods of Rome and (in the Temple of the Vesta, the hearth fire of the state) the Eternal Flame of Rome will be kept burning. Aeneas’s Discipline Another difference between Aeneas and the Greek heroes is his self-control. Achilles was naturally excessive; and Odysseus was typically impulsive, giving in to curiosity or egotism until he acquired self-control and responsibility the hard way, through painful experience. Aeneas, however, seems to come already equipped with the Roman virtues of responsibility and self-discipline. An instructive instances are the visits of the two heroes Aeneas and Odysseus to the land of the Cyclops. There, in the place where Odysseus’s impulsive egotism got him into trouble with Poseidon, Aeneas exhibits both self-control and compassion: he takes aboard an enemy sailor, Achaemenides, supposedly “left behind” by the irresponsible Odysseus (an incident that appears nowhere in Homer but that clearly illustrates the virtues that Virgil attributed to his more proper Roman hero). In another ironic comment on Homer’s Odysseus, Aeneas insists that the Trojans do not land at Carthage to raid the city—“to loot the household gods of Libya, or to drive down stolen booty toward the beaches.” The difference between Greek and Roman heroes is most blatantly revealed in a pair of parallel incidents in Book 10, in which Virgil contrasts the behavior of the Greek-style hero Turnus (explicitly compared to “a new Achilles”) with that of the Roman hero Aeneas. Turnus, an experienced general, comes on the young prince Pallas, in his first battle, on the battlefield. He not only kills the young man but strips him of his gold belt and wears it to boast of his victory. For Turnus, the glory is in the body count, and the belt is his trophy. In a similar incident, Aeneas comes on a young Latin soldier, Lausus, who is taking incredible risks to defend his father, a notorious tyrant. So struck is Aeneas by the young man’s pious devotion to the idea of fatherhood that, remembering his own father, Aeneas treats Lausus respectfully, offering him the opportunity to avoid the encounter. When Lausus insists on fighting and is killed, Aeneas makes a point of refusing to strip the armor, instead returning the corpse with honor to the youth’s companions. Aeneas’s Rage Despite his courtesy and stated preference for treaties rather than battles, Aeneas is not passive. Not only does he fight like a demon when necessary, but when his anger is aroused, “his wrath is terrible.” Unlike Achilles’, though, Ae- neas’s anger is not fueled by slights to his ego. It is only when he experiences a deep sense of moral outrage that he allows his anger to express itself in the service of a higher goal: when he comes on Helen in the ruins of Troy; when Turnus kills Pallas and strips his armor; when the Latins violate treaty after treaty; and, of course, after their last battle, when Aeneas sees Pallas’s belt on Turnus’s shoulder. But he does learn, in the course of his experience, to control the occasions when he allows that"},{"pageNumber":903,"pageContent":"The Ktnoid 867 FIGURE 19-1 Aeneas and Anchises. Shown in this Attic vase painting (c. 510 B.C.) carry- ing his father, Anchises, on his back and leading his son, Ascanius, by the hand, Aeneas is an apt emblem of the duty of a Roman hero—or a Roman citizen: to carry on the ancient tra- ditions, to sustain the Roman state, and to lead it to an even greater future. But that great re- sponsibility is clearly a heavy burden: Aeneas, his head with its great helmet bowed, droops under the weight. (Martin von Wagner Museum, Wurzburg) anger to be translated into action. When he meets Helen, his mother, Venus, must temper his instinctive desire to kill her on the spot, just as Athene must temper Achilles’ urge to kill Agamemnon during their quarrel. Venus instructs her son in the gods’ perspective; by the time of Aeneas’s encounter with Turnus, no god needs to intervene—Aeneas has adopted the gods’ perspective as his own. Women in the Aeneid Like the heroes, the women, both divine and human, in the Aeneid are divided into those who are on the Roman side and those who are Rome’s enemies. On the pro- Roman side are Aeneas’s wife, Creusa [kree-OO-sa], and his mother, Venus. Creusa In an image that emphasizes the epic’s patriarchal focus, Aeneas escapes from Troy carrying his father (the burden of the past) on his back and leading his son (his duty toward the future) by the hand (Figure 19-1). His wife, Creusa, left to follow along, lags behind and is killed by Greek soldiers. When Aeneas realizes that she is missing, he goes back to find her but discovers only her shade (or ghost). In a"},{"pageNumber":904,"pageContent":"868 The World of Roman Myth scene reminiscent of Odysseus’s attempt to embrace the shade of his mother in Ha- des, he tries three times to embrace her, only to hnd nothing there but air, an apt image of her insubstantial value when compared with the larger enterprise of found- ing Rome. The behavior of Creusa’s shade is nevertheless a model of Roman devotion to duty. Characterizing Aeneas’s weeping as “fanatic sorrow,” she instructs him to accept the gods’ arrangement of their destinies, to seek a new kingdom and a new bride, and to stop fretting and get on with his mission. That is the last we hear of her, or of mourn- ing—a revealing contrast to the extended funeral games (exactly like those Achilles held in honor of Patroclus) that Aeneas holds for his dead father. Women in Roman myth clearly are expendable. Marriage and the Family Marriage, for the Romans, is a sacred institution. But marriages are made for political or economic reasons—love is not essential. Thus, Aeneas will wed the Latin princess Lavinia in order to cement the bond between Latins and Trojans, despite her hostility and his lack of any personal relationship with her. And Dido, whom he loves, he does not marry—an omission he reminds her of (“I have never entered into such agreements,” he says) when she, thinking of him as her husband, begs him to stay. Fatherhood, in this patriarchal world, is essential. Motherhood, however, is sub- sumed in the larger affairs of state. Lavinia’s mother Amata, for example, explaining her disapproval of King Latinus’s plan to break their daughter’s engagement to Tur- nus and marry her instead to Aeneas, is simply dismissed. Two Mothers: Thetis and Venus It is also instructive to contrast the maternal re- lationship, outwardly similar, of Thetis and Achilles with that of Venus and Aeneas. They both have similar functions, carrying messages between Zeus/Jupiter and their respective sons or appealing to Hephaestus/Vulcan for new shields when their sons are about to face battle. But their goals for their respective offspring differ radically. Thetis wanted to protect Achilles from harm; of his two fates, she’d clearly prefer the safer choice—long life, even without glory. Not so Venus: committed to her own political agenda, as well as to her son’s political responsibilities as future father of his country, she wants him to found Rome, even if it means struggle, sacrihce, and sor- row for him personally. Thus, she participates in the plot with Juno to cause him to fall in love with Dido in order to protect his ships—and his mission—knowing that he will have to leave and will suffer emotionally as a result. Juno and Juturna On the anti-Roman side are Juno (always described, until she yields to Jupiter, as “savage Juno”) and the goddess Juturna (the “fanatic” sister of Turnus). Between themselves, these two goddesses encourage Dido’s neglect of Car- thage, the fury of Amata (queen of Latium), Turnus’s rage, the Latins’ repeated break- ing of treaties, and acts of violence such as the burning of Aeneas’s ships. They even interfere, in trying to deprive Aeneas of victory, by preventing him from hnding Turnus on the battlefield, often plucking him up, chariot and all, and depositing him, much to his consternation, on the other side of the river. Even more revealing of the “savage” goddess’s chthonic powers (characterized throughout the epic as violent and irrational), Juno calls up the powers of Allecto, one of the Furies, from her home in the Underworld. Associated by Virgil with the"},{"pageNumber":905,"pageContent":"TheKcntid 869 poison of the Gorgon, she sends a snake into the breast of Amata and implants a firebrand in the heart of Turnus, driving both mad, so that Amata is compelled to Bacchic frenzies and Turnus to equally frenzied violence in war. Thus, whether they are loved or hated, men are victims of the terrible goddesses. Juno may not have the power to change Jupiter’s plan for Rome, but she can delay its implementation as long as possible, as Poseidon had delayed Odysseus. But the dif- ference is revealing. Poseidon’s delay was caused by Odysseus’s own pride, his vain boasting that revealed his identity to the Cyclops, and its duration (a finite sentence that Zeus insisted must not exceed the crime) coincided with Odysseus’s moral de- velopment. Juno s delaying the founding of Rome and her persecution of Aeneas are not in proportion to Aeneas’s behavior or moral condition. As many scholars have noted, even Turnus, whom Juno ostensibly protects, is destroyed in the process, and Aeneas, despite Venus’s assistance, never gets to see the promised city of Rome—nor will anyone for several centuries. Meanwhile, the firebrand of war will keep burning. According to some readers, Juno thus has, in effect, the last word, despite “yielding” to Jupiter. In fact, immediately after Juno and Jupiter settle affairs between them- selves, Jupiter himself sends a Fury to paralyze Turnus, setting him up for Aeneas to slay. Dido Between these pro- and anti-Roman extremes is the figure of Dido. Like Aeneas, caught up in an affair beyond her control, she is portrayed sympathetically— the victim, in turn, of the gods and of Aeneas, who loves her and then, ordered by the gods, rather unceremoniously abandons her. Aeneas is not gifted, like Odysseus, with “honeyed words” to let her down gently. Virgil grants Dido a long lament in which she expresses her grief and sorrow. But the contrast to the Odyssey is revealing. Portraying Aeneas as sitting at Dido’s table and telling his story in flashbacks, Virgil connects Dido with two women in Homer’s epic. One is Nausicaa, in whose father’s hall Odysseus tells his own tale. But unlike Alcinuous, who offers Odysseus half his kingdom and his daughter, Nausicaa, if he wants to stay, and free passage home if he wants to leave. Dido’s offer to share her kingdom with Aeneas has a catch—he must stay. And unlike Nausicaa, Dido is overwhelmed by her visitor’s departure. By at- tempting, in effect, to imprison her lover. Dido reflects not Nausicaa but Calypso, who keeps Odysseus as her prisoner and sex-slave, until Hermes brings the message from Zeus that she must release him. Virgil’s contemporaries would surely have seen a parallel between Dido and, in their own recent history, Cleopatra, the Egyptian queen who loved the Roman gen- eral (and Julius Caesar’s associate) Marc Antony. She bore him three children during his prolonged stay in Egypt, and when Antony was defeated by Octavian (later known as Augustus) at the battle of Actium, Egypt was subordinated to Rome, and Antony’s career was in ruins. Cleopatra and Antony both committed suicide. Like Cleopatra, to whom she is implicitly compared in the later description of Aeneas’s shield. Dido has abandoned her city and compromised her reputation, all for love—and now she has lost that. In anger and despair, she curses Aeneas, calls for an avenger, and com- mits suicide. Pitying her in her agony, as she dies an unm.erited death brought on by her emotional frenzy, Juno sends Iris to free her spirit from her body, ending her misery. On a personal level, Virgil clearly sympathizes with Dido in her predicament, just as he does with Turnus; neither understands what has gone wrong. Dido has devoted"},{"pageNumber":906,"pageContent":"870 The World of Roman Myth herself to love as Turnus has to honor, and both die bewildered, watching a world they thought they understood crumble about them. In Dido’s death (as in Turnus’s, which Virgil likewise presents sympathetically), we see the poet burying with honor a set of values long admired by, but no longer appropriate for, contemporary Romans. Wrapped up in the pursuit of purely personal satisfactions. Dido has abandoned her responsibility and neglected her city-in-progress. Many modern readers find Ae- neas cold, even inhuman, in his response to Dido. However, she has allowed an excess of emotion to break down her self-control. A good Roman would have mourned briefly and then gotten back to work, as Aeneas did on losing Creusa. It is not Dido’s plight itself but her response to the burdens and sorrows of her life that is characterized as understandable but ultimately un-Roman—a foil to Aeneas’s proper response. Virgil is sorry for Dido (witness Aeneas’s appeal to her shade in the Underworld, which she rejects). But although the worthy Roman sheds “tears for passing things”—for Creusa, for Troy, for Dido, for Pallas, for all the personal be- trayals, losses, and sorrows that life entails—and even memorializes them in stone, or in verse, he must not allow sorrow to prevent him from carrying out his duty to Rome or from seeing the historical perspective, from which his personal fate is rela- tively insignificant. The Gods and Human Fate In one of the most revealing scenes in the epic, Venus tears away the “cloud” from Aeneas’s eyes so that he can see the destruction of Troy from the gods’ viewpoint. In a superficially similar scene in the Iliad, Athene removed the cloud from the eyes of Diomedes so that he could distinguish the gods from the humans intermingled on the battlefield. The differences, however, are striking: whereas in the Greek epic the gods and humans were caught up in the same battle, in the Roman version human action is ultimately an illusion—at best, the humans are agents in a divine plan they cannot see or comprehend. They may think that Greeks fight with Trojans, but it is actually the gods doing battle with gods, Venus reveals. Thus, there is no point in Aeneas’s killing Helen—she isn’t the real cause of the Trojan War. If Troy falls, it falls so that Rome can eventually arise. The most significant things Aeneas can reclaim from the ruins of Troy, apart from his son (who will be the ancestor of the Romans), are the Vesta (the statue of the hearth goddess) and the Eternal Flame (the divine spirit of Rome), which Aeneas is to keep burning until it can be enshrined anew in the Eternal City itself At every level in the Aeneid, human destiny is revealed to be a function of divine politics. Even love, that most intimate of emotions, is not exempt: Venus and Juno, each for her own political aims, cause Dido and Aeneas to fall in love—Venus to protect Aeneas’s Roman mission by ensuring that Dido won’t attack him or burn his ships, Juno to transfer Rome’s destiny as Eternal City to Carthage. The goddesses, acting on a script they have prewritten, further cause the two to consummate their love in a carefully prepared setting—a cave in which they take shelter right on cue from a storm arranged by Juno. That intrusion of the political into the personal was not confined to myths: under Augustus, the interference of the state in the personal lives of individuals was such that Augustus oversaw the passing of laws to regulate (and even require) marriage (and remarriage, after divorce or widowhood), with heavy financial penalties for those who failed to comply."},{"pageNumber":907,"pageContent":"77^^’Aeneid 871 Unlike the Iliad, in which “fates” were always plural, or the Odyssey, in which ones destiny was determined by ones moral status, in the Aeneid, the humans find themselves acting out roles in a scenario the gods have devised. Their only choices lie in how to respond to the burdens the gods dole out. Jupiter assures Venus from the very first that her “children’s fate is firm,” that Rome will indeed be established, pros- per, and endure eternally. The Underworld In the Underworld, Aeneas is guided by the Cumaean Sibyl [koo-MEE-an SIB-il], the priestess who is the oracle at the shrine of Apollo at Cumae (the location of an early Greek colony in Italy) where Aeneas first reaches the Italian coast. He is also instructed by the shade of his father, Anchises, from whom he finally learns his ulti- mate destiny and the meaning of his suffering. It is then that the key question—why is a good man compelled by the gods to suffer?—is at last answered. Borrowing from Homer’s description of Odysseus’s journey to the Underworld, with additional details extrapolated from Plato’s description in his dialogue Phaedo, Virgil elaborates on an Underworld divided into nine circles, each administering eter- nal justice to a different category of human souls. The upper circles include the in- nocent (such as infants and martyrs), the suicides, and a separate circle for the “Fields of Mourning,” those who were “consumed with bitter love.” It is here that Aeneas meets the shade of Dido, still unreconciled to her fate, who turns from him as the eternally unforgiving Ajax did from Odysseus. The road through the Underworld then divides. The highway to the left leads to Tartarus, where various kinds of wickedness are punished; the road to the right leads toward Elysium, where the souls of the blessed spend eternity. (Wherever the Ro- mans went, they seem to have built highways, complete with roadsigns!) It is here that the shade of Anchises, like Tiresias in the Odyssey, points his son toward the path that will lead him to his goal. As both moral guide to the upper world and tour guide to the lower, he explains to Aeneas how the good are eventually rewarded—not in their lives on earth, where sorrow and loss may prevail even for the deserving, but in eternity. In a modification of the doctrine of reincarnation of souls borrowed from Plato, Anchises tells Aeneas that, for most souls, awareness of the “Universal Mind” within them is dulled by the body and that the resulting blind- ness clings even after death. Consequently, most souls, washed clean of memory by the river Lethe [LEE-thee], are recycled every millennium until they can manage to purify themselves sufficiently. A few—pure priests, proud patriots, and pious poets (Virgil himself undoubtedly one of them)—escape the endless cycle of reincarnations and enter Elysium, where they spend eternity, Roman style, listening to music, feast- ing, currying their horses, and polishing their chariots and weapons. This, in the long run, is the eternal reward for service—for those who accept the burdens and losses and serve Rome faithfully. From this perspective, to get overly upset about the pains (or overly committed to the pleasures) of life in the present world is to take only the short view. In the big picture, everyone gets exactly what he or she deserves. Anchises also gets the opportunity here to explain the future of Rome, from the founding to Augustus, who will renew the Golden Age and extend his empire to the ends of the earth, making war redundant. Rome’s unique contribution to the renewal"},{"pageNumber":908,"pageContent":"872 The World of Roman Myth of the Golden Age will be its mastery of the art of government and its ability— through conquest if necessary—to bring and teach peace to all the world. Having seen Elysium, Aeneas is understandably reluctant to leave. Nevertheless, the vision of Rome before him, he accepts the burden of his mission with a new commitment. We never again hear him complaining that his life is not his own. From this point on, he never hesitates. To achieve that grand vision, no suffering, no sacrifice is too great. An Ironic View Some contemporary scholars interpret this vision of “Rome tri- umphant” as ironic. One might ask whether Augustus would have continued to pro- vide government funds to the poet or would have rescued the poem from the flames to which Virgil consigned it in his will if he had seen it as condemning himself and his plans or even as presenting them ambivalently. (It is perhaps for just such a sus- picion that he may have later forced the poet Ovid into exile.) Personal political views apart, there is some evidence to support the ironic view. On leaving Elysium, Aeneas is led through the Gate of Ivory, traditionally the source of false dreams (as opposed to the Gates of Horn, which led to true or prophetic dreams). Is Virgil a prophet of Rome’s grandeur or of its doom, prefigured here in the gloom of the Underworld? In a complex work such as this, to be sure, many readings are possible. But could Augustus have missed such a broad hint? The image of the two gates through which all dreams pass is hardly an esoteric reference whose meaning might have eluded a mere politician; it was, after all, a commonplace meta- phor. It even occurred in the Iliady which every Roman schoolboy no doubt read. And although an ironic reading is conceivable, the fact that readers and scholars for almost two millennia thereafter did not note the possibility suggests that, whatever inherent meaning we might now find in the material, the poet and his contemporar- ies did not detect in the image of the Gate of Ivory an implicit rejection of the Augustan vision. Further, even if Anchises’ vision is deceptive, Jupiter himself has already made the same statement at the beginning of the epic, reciting the future history of Rome to Venus. And he will repeat it to Juno at the end. Surely, Virgil never implies that founding or preserving Rome will be quick or easy, or without pain or loss—on the contrary. In fact, Anchises alludes to but denies his son a prevision of the death of Pallas, perhaps fearing that such foreknowledge would keep Aeneas from persevering. But the difficulties entailed do not deny the value of the vision itself. Rome, after all, did come about, and, the hated civil wars over, Virgil and his fellow poets (his friend Horace, for instance, who also wrote poems celebrating Augustus) seemed to share in the sense of relief and the renewed hope for the future. If Eternal Rome, further, was in fact a dream, it may have been a dream worth holding onto. Finally, we might recall here the Roman preference for demythologizing their mythic material and presenting it more realistically. In the real world, even in a cul- ture given to superstition, people simply don’t go to the Underworld. Nevertheless, to share in the tradition of epic heroes before him, Aeneas, presented by Virgil as a historical, and not simply mythological, figure, must go there as well. Presenting the obligatory voyage of the hero to the Underworld as an illusion, a false dream, allows the poet to have it both ways—to present his vision and to explain away its more difficult-to-swallow components. And yet, it would not be altogether inconsistent with this vision of hope for Virgil to have used the Underworld episode as a subtle reminder that around the edges of every dream lurks the possibility of nightmare."},{"pageNumber":909,"pageContent":"The Ktneid 873 The Last Battle As in the Iliad, the climax of the Aeneid is the long-delayed combat between the two opposing warriors, and once again the contrast between the Iliad and the Aeneid is revealing. In Homer’s work, the tension between the possible outcomes was stressed—even if the audience knew how it would end, the participants (including the gods) did not. Until the last moment, Apollo had hopes for Hector. And when Zeus held up his scales, he did not know in advance which side would sink down. In the Aeneid, Jupiter possesses a similar pair of scales, one of many Homeric trappings that Virgil borrows. But it is ultimately a meaningless gesture. Not only does Jupiter himself weight the scales, adding two “different fates,” but the gods know in advance the outcome of the battle, as does the shade of Anchises in the Underworld. Before Aeneas and Turnus even meet on the battlefield, Juno yields and asks instead for a union of the two peoples: the Latins will be allowed to keep their name and language; they will become one larger, eclectic culture, Latin and Trojan (Greek) merged; and Juno will be worshiped alongside Jupiter as queen of the Roman gods. Only then does the no-longer-climactic battle take place. When Aeneas finally encounters Turnus, he defeats the Latin general fairly rapidly, taking advantage of the paralysis of terror wrought by the Fury sent by Jupiter. In- deed, Juturna, Turnus’s goddess-sister and charioteer, sees that Fury and leaves her brother, recognizing Jupiter’s impending destruction of Turnus, before the battle with Aeneas actually occurs. Turnus is reduced to begging on his knees for mercy, not for his corpse to be respected, as Hector had, but for his life. Achilles, in the parallel Homeric encounter, enraged at Hector for killing Patroclus and wearing his helmet, would not listen to any such pleas. Aeneas, in contrast, is moved to be compassionate and is about to grant Turnus’s request when he sees the belt of Pallas that the Latin had boastfully confiscated and worn to display his prowess, as heroes in the Iliad regularly did. Two Views of Aeneas Some readers argue that this scene, too, is presented ironi- cally, showing an Aeneas corrupted by war and by serving as the agent of an exploit- ative, imperialist government. Beginning as a model Roman hero, he becomes just like the Greeks—another Achilles, who coldheartedly murders a man begging for mercy. Aeneas’s last act, they argue, reveals how service to such a government insti- tution gradually destroys the humanity of those who serve it. Others see the “two Aeneases” as representing the gap between public figure and private individual that political leaders must experience, requiring a public display of confidence and sup- pression of private doubts. (One writer asserts that the contradictions in Aeneas’s character are the result of Virgil’s having changed his mind in the middle of writing but not having finished the necessary revisions.) Such interpretations would certainly help rescue the work for contemporary readers whose sensibilities are offended by a poet who both supports the Establish- ment and portrays at least some circumstances in which violence is acceptable. But those interpretations must be argued despite Virgil’s repeated presentation of Turnus’s fanatic behavior. It is true, of course, that Turnus is a victim, trapped by the gods, as were Aeneas and Dido. But sympathy is not the same as approval. And neither Dido nor Turnus is merely a victim. Turnus is also a cruel, fanatical, ego-driven, and treach- erous man."},{"pageNumber":910,"pageContent":"874 The World of Roman Myth Another View One might alternatively argue that Aeneas starts out as a Greek-style hero—witness his Achilles-like rage at Helen, which Venus must interrupt by seizing his hand (just as Athene in the Iliad had prevented Achilles from stabbing Agamem- non), and his Odysseus-like lingering on the couch of Dido. But already he is more compassionate (he rescues Achaemenides) and more civilized (he doesn’t “raid” Car- thage). And instructed (and occasionally scolded) by Venus and Jupiter, he learns to become a complete Roman hero, his outbursts of rage now coming only when the state is at risk or the gods are offended or denied. In fact, one scholar argues that Turnus is Aeneas’s “second self” and that, in killing Turnus, Aeneas is “killing” the old-style, heroic self that he has outgrown. It is signihcant that no god intervenes when, following the death of Pallas, Aeneas grows uncharacteristically savage in battle. There is, pointedly, no parallel here to the equivalent scene in the Iliad when the river god Scamander attacked Achilles, who had been venting his rage and heaping up corpses into the river. The very same gods who condemned both Achilles’ and Tur- nus’s behavior apparently approve of Aeneas’s. Further, beneath the momentary surface resemblances between Achilles and Ae- neas, important differences emerge. First, whereas Patroclus was an experienced fighter (albeit no Achilles) who killed twenty-seven men in his last moments, Pallas is a youth in his first battle, an unfair match to begin with, as Virgil earlier made clear. Thus, for Turnus to boast of the kill and wear Pallas’s belt is not only a reversion to the other heroic model but also an unwarranted boast—Pallas is a relatively easy mark. Second, Jupiter himself takes pains to comment on the inappropriateness of Turnus’s wearing the belt and warns that punishment will inevitably follow. Moreover, unlike Achilles, who vowed to eat Hector’s body raw, Aeneas is tempted to show mercy—an exact inversion of the earlier scene in which he is tempted to kill Helen—only to have the moral outrage of that senseless and shameful killing propel him to act against instinct and do what the gods have already acknowledged must be done. Only then, in an outburst of what the later Roman poet Juvenal (c. A.D. 60- 128) called saeva indignatio (“righteous indignation”), does the otherwise restrained Aeneas allow himself to vent his rage in violence and kill Turnus. That his rage helps him overcome his initial reluctance, that he kills in anger and precisely not with the cool detachment of a state assassin, and that he feels compelled even in the act of killing Turnus to shout that it is Pallas who kills him makes his final act, one might argue, more rather than less human. Like the shades of the suitors in the Odyssey, Turnus’s shade flees to Hades, unrepentant and angry still. If there was once a gap between the private man, tormented by personal feelings forever thwarted by the gods, and the public man, destined to bear the burden of Rome’s future, that gap closes at last at this moment. The Aeneid: An Overview Virgil, then, presents us with a complex work featuring a character who, for better or worse, grows and changes, and a multiple and often ambivalent perspective on the events portrayed. The world of the Aeneid is one in which individuals, burdened by the need to serve and driven and even deceived by gods with political agendas of their own, are bound to suffer “loss on bitter loss.” The question is, is the goal worth the sacrifice? Even if the answer turns out to be no, what choice is there?

Finally, what is the alternative? Rome in general and Virgil in particular had already seen the alternative, and nothing in the gloom of the Underworld could match the horrors of the real-life wars, both foreign and civil, that produced not human freedom but only terror and chaos. Of course Virgil was ambivalent about war—what compassionate human being isn’t? There is certainly a conflict between humanism and war, and there may well be a conflict between humanism and government. But to argue (as Freud did) that war is the price we pay for civilization and then to argue (as Freud did not) that the price is too high is to condemn humans to live in a psychological Underworld, where the terrible forces of unrestrained libido are in control.

Where are you going?” To these her questions he replied with sighs; 320 he drew his words from deep within his breast: “O goddess, if I tracked my story back until its first beginning, were there time to hear the annals of our trials, then the evening would have shut Olympus’ gates and gathered in the day before I ended. But we were sailing out from ancient Troy— if Troy means anything to you—across strange seas when, as it willed, a tempest drove us upon the coasts of Libya. I am pious 330 Aeneas, and I carry in my ships my household gods together with me, rescued from Argive enemies; my fame is known beyond the sky. I seek out Italy, my country, my ancestors born of Jove. When I set out upon the Phrygian sea, I had twice-ten ships, and my goddess-mother showed me the way; I followed my firm fates. Now I am left with scarcely seven galleys, ships shattered by the waves and the east wind; 340 and I myself, a needy stranger, roam across the wilderness of Libya; I am driven out of Europe, out of Asia.” But Venus had enough of his complaints, and so she interrupted his lament: “Whoever you may be, I hardly think the heaven-dwellers hold a grudge against you: the breath of life is yours, and you are near a Tyrian city. Only make your way until you reach the palace of the queen. 350 For I can tell you truthfully: your comrades are given back to you, your fleet is saved and driven toward sure waters by the winds that shifted to the north—unless my parents"},{"pageNumber":920,"pageContent":"884 VIRGIL have taught me augury to no good end.

And now, in long array, they either seem 360 to settle down or else to hover, waiting and watching those that have already landed; and just as they, returning, play with rustling wings, as they wheel about the sky in crews, and give themselves to song—not otherwise your ships and youths are either in the harbor or near its mouth with swelling sails. Only move on and follow where this pathway leads.” These were the words of Venus. When she turned, her neck was glittering with a rose brightness; 370 her hair anointed with ambrosia, her head gave all a fragrance of the gods; her gown was long and to the ground; even her walk was sign enough she was a goddess. And when Aeneas recognized his mother, he followed her with these words as she fled: “Why do you mock your son—so often and so cruelly—with these lying apparitions? Why can’t I ever join you, hand to hand, to hear, to answer you with honest words?” 380 So he reproaches her, then takes the road to Carthage. But as goddess, Venus cloaks Aeneas and Achates in dark mist; she wraps them in a cape of cloud so thick that none can see or touch them or delay their way or ask why they had come. And she herself glides through the skies to Paphos, gladly revisiting her home, her temple and her hundred altars fragrant with fresh garlands and warm with their Sabaean frankincense. 390 Meanwhile Aeneas and the true Achates press forward on their path. They climb a hill that overhangs the city, looking down upon the facing towers. Aeneas marvels at the enormous buildings, once mere huts, and at the gates and tumult and paved streets.

Just as the bees in early summer, busy beneath the sunlight through the flowered meadows, when some lead on their full-grown young and others press out the flowing honey, pack the cells with sweet nectar, or gather in the burdens of those returning; some, in columns, drive the drones, a lazy herd, out of the hives; the work is fervent, and the fragrant honey is sweet with thyme. “How fortunate are those whose walls already rise!” Aeneas cries while gazing at the rooftops of the city. Then, sheltered by a mist, astoundingly, he enters in among the crowd, mingling together with the Tyrians. No one sees him. Just at the center of the city stood a thickly shaded wood; this was the place where, when they landed, the Phoenicians first— hurled there by whirlwind and by wave—dug up an omen that Queen Juno had pointed out: the head of a fierce stallion. This had meant the nations easy wealth and fame in war throughout the ages. Here Sidonian Dido was building a stupendous shrine for Juno, enriched with gifts and with the goddess’ statue, where flights of steps led up to brazen thresholds; the architraves were set on posts of brass; the grating hinges of the doors were brass. Within this grove, the sights—so strange to him— have, for the first time, stilled Aeneas’ fear; here he first dared to hope he had found shelter, to trust more surely in his shattered fortunes. For while he waited for the queen, he studied everything in that huge sanctuary, marveling at a city rich enough for such a temple, at the handiwork of rival artists, at their skillful tasks. He sees the wars of Troy set out in order: the battles famous now through all the world, the sons of Atreus and of Priam, and Achilles, savage enemy to both. 400 410 420 430 440"},{"pageNumber":922,"pageContent":"886 VIRGIL He halted.

With many tears and sighs he feeds his soul on what is nothing but a picture. He watched the warriors circling Pergamus: here routed Greeks were chased by Trojan fighters and here the Phrygian troops pursued by plumed Achilles in his chariot. Nearby, sobbing, he recognized the snow-white canvas 460 tents of King Rhesus—with his men betrayed, while still in their first sleep, and then laid waste, with many dead, by bloody Diomedes, who carried off their fiery war horses before they had a chance to taste the pastures of Troy, or drink the waters of the Xanthus.

And just as, on the banks of the Eurotas or through the heights of Cynthus, when Diana incites her dancers, and her followers, 500 a thousand mountain-nymphs, press in behind her, she wears a quiver slung across her shoulder; and as she makes her way, she towers over all other goddesses; gladness excites Latona’s silent breast; even so.

And then below the temple’s central dome— facing the doorway of the goddess, guarded by arms—she took her place on a high throne. 510 Dido was dealing judgments to her people and giving laws, apportioning the work of each with fairness or by drawing lots; when suddenly Aeneas sees, as they press forward through the mighty multitude, Sergestus, Antheus, and the brave Cloanthus, and other Trojans whom the black whirlwind had scattered on the waters, driven far to other coasts. Aeneas is astounded; both joy and fear have overcome Achates. 520 They burned to join right hands with their companions, but this strange happening confuses them. They stay in hiding, screened by folds of fog, and wait to see what fortune found their friends, on what beach they have left the fleet, and why they come; for these were men who had been chosen from all the ships to ask for grace, who now made for the temple door with loud outcries. When they had entered and received their leave to speak in Dido’s presence, then the eldest, 530 Ilioneus, calmly began: “O Queen, whom Jupiter has granted this: to bring to being a new city, curbing haughty nations by justice—we, unhappy Trojans, men carried by the winds across all seas, beg you to keep the terror of fire from"},{"pageNumber":924,"pageContent":"888 VIRGIL our fleet, to spare a pious race, to look on us with kindliness.

I, in fact, shall send my trusted riders out along the shores, to comb the farthest coasts of Libya and to see if, cast out of the waters, he is wandering through the forests or the cities.” The words of Dido stir the brave Achates and father Aeneas; long since, both of them had burned to break free from their cloud. Achates speaks first to his companion: “Goddess-born, what counsel rises in your spirit now? You see that everything is safe, our ships and sailors saved. And only one is missing, whom we ourselves saw sink among the waves.

First at the very sight of him, and then at all he had endured, Sidonian Dido was startled. And she told the Trojan this: “You, goddess-born, what fortune hunts you down through such tremendous trials? What violence has forced you onto these ferocious shores? 660 Are you that same Aeneas, son of Dardan Anchises, whom the gracious Venus bore beside the banks of Phrygian Simois?

And even then I learned of Troy s disaster, and of your name and of the kings of Greece. 670 And though he was the Trojans’ enemy, Teucer would often praise the Teucrians and boast that he was born of their old race.

But meanwhile she does not neglect his comrades. She sends down to the beaches twenty bullocks, a hundred fat lambs with their ewes, and Bacchus’ glad gift of wine. Within the palace gleam the furnishings of royal luxury; the feast is readied in the atrium. And there are draperies of noble purple woven with art; and plates of massive silver upon the tables; and, engraved in gold, 690 the sturdy deeds of Dido’s ancestors, a long, long line of happenings and heroes traced from the first beginnings of her race. Aeneas (for his father’s love could not permit his mind to rest) now quickly sends Achates to the Trojan ships, to carry these tidings to Ascanius, to lead Aeneas’ son up to the walls of Carthage: all his paternal love and care are for Ascanius. He also tells Achates 700 to bring back gifts snatched from the wreck of Troy: a tunic stiff with images of gold, and then a veil whose fringes were of saffron acanthus—these once worn by Argive Helen, who had borne them off to Troy and her unlawful wedding v/hen she had fled Mycenae—splendid gifts of her mother Leda; and besides, the scepter that had once been carried by Ilione, eldest of Priam’s daughters, a necklace set with pearls, and then a crown 710 that had twin circles set with jewels and gold. And hurrying to do all he was told, Achates made his way down to the boats. But in her breast the Cytherean ponders new stratagems, new guile: that Cupid, changed in form and feature, come instead of sweet Ascanius and, with his gifts, inflame the queen to madness and insinuate a fire in Dido’s very bones.

For you know how, through the hatred of resentful Juno, across the sea and every shore your brother 730 Aeneas has been hunted down; and often you have sorrowed with my sorrow. Now Phoenician Dido has hold of him; with sweet words she would make him stay. The hospitality of Juno—and where it may lead—makes me afraid; at such a turn I know she’ll not be idle. So, before she has a chance, I plan to catch the queen by craftiness, to girdle Dido with a flame, so that no god can turn her back; I’ll hold her fast 740 with great love for Aeneas. Hear me now; I need your help to carry out this plot. Ascanius, my dearest care, is ready to go along to the Sidonian city, called by his loving father, carrying gifts saved from Troy in flames and from the sea. But I shall lull the royal boy to sleep on high Cythera or Idalium and hide him in my holy house, so that he cannot know—or interrupt—our trap. 750 And you will need—for one night and no more— to counterfeit his features; as a boy, to wear that boy’s familiar face, and so when Dido, joyful, draws you close during the feasting and the flowing wine, when she embraces you, and kisses tenderly, your breath can fill her with a hidden flame, your poison penetrate, deceivingly.” Love does what his dear mother asks. He sheds his wings and gladly tries the walk of lulus. 760 But Venus pours upon Ascanius a gentle rest.

Gladly—Achates is his guide—he brings the Tyrians royal gifts. As he arrives, he finds the banqueting begun, the queen 770 already settled on her couch of gold beneath resplendent awnings, at the center. Father Aeneas and the Trojan warriors now gather; they recline on purple covers. The servants pour out water for their hands and promptly offer bread from baskets and bring towels smooth in texture for the guests. Inside are fifty handmaids at their stations— their care to stock the storerooms and to honor the household gods with fire—and a hundred 780 more women, and as many male attendants of equal age with them, to load the tables with food and place the cups. The Tyrians, too, have gathered, crowding through the happy halls— all these invited to brocaded couches. They marvel at Aeneas’ gifts, at liilus— the god’s bright face and his fictitious words— and at the cloak, the veil adorned with saffron acanthus borders. And above all, luckless Dido—doomed to face catastrophe— 790 can’t sate her soul, inflamed by what she sees; the boy, the gifts excite her equally. And he pretends to satisfy a father’s great love by hanging on Aeneas’ neck in an embrace. Then he seeks out the queen. Her eyes cling fast to him, and all her heart; at times she fondles him upon her lap — for Dido does not know how great a god is taking hold of her poor self. But Cupid, remembering his mother, Venus, slowly 800 begins to mist the memory of Sychaeus and with a living love tries to surprise her longings gone to sleep, her unused heart. And at the first pause in the feast the tables are cleared away. They fetch enormous bowls and crown the wine with wreaths.

She offered her libation, pouring her wine upon the boards; and then she was the first to take the cup, but only touching her lips to it. She passed it next to Bitias and spurred him to be quick. He drained the foaming cup with eagerness and drenched himself in that gold flood; in turn the other chieftains drank. Long-haired lopas, whom mighty Atlas once had taught, lifts up 830 his golden lyre, sounding through the hall. He sings the wandering moon; the labors of the sun; the origins of men and beasts, of water and of fire; and of Arcturus, the stormy Hyades, and the twin Bears; and why the winter suns so rush to plunge in Ocean: what holds back the lingering nights.

But Anchises raised his glad eyes to the stars and lifted heavenward his voice and hands: ‘O Jupiter, all-able one, if you are moved by any prayers, look on us. I only ask you this: if by our goodness we merit it, then. Father, grant to us 210 your help and let your sign confirm these omens.’ “No sooner had the old man spoken so than sudden thunder crashed upon the left, and through the shadows ran a shooting star, its trail a torch of flooding light. It glides above the highest housetops as we watch, until the brightness that has marked its course is buried in the woods of Ida: far and wide the long wake of that furrow shines, and sulphur smokes upon the land. At last, 220 won over by this sign, my father rises, to greet the gods, to adore the sacred star: ‘Now my delay is done; I follow; where you lead, I am. Gods of my homeland, save my household, save my grandson. Yours, this omen; and Troy is in your keeping. Yes, I yield. My son, I go with you as your companion.’ “These were his words.

From different directions, we shall meet at this one point. My father, you will carry the holy vessels and our homeland’s gods. Filthy with war, just come from slaughter, I must never touch these sacred things until I bathe myself within a running stream.’ “This said, I spread a tawny lion skin across my bent neck, over my broad shoulders, and then take up Anchises; small liilus 250 now clutches my right hand; his steps uneven, he is following his father; and my wife moves on behind. We journey through dark places; and I, who just before could not be stirred by any weapons cast at me or by the crowds of Greeks in charging columns, now am terrified by all the breezes, startled by every sound, in fear for son and father. “And now, as I approached the gates and thought I had found the way of my escape, the sudden 260 and frequent tramp of feet was at my ears; and peering through the shades, Anchises cries: ‘My son, take flight; my son, they are upon us. I see their gleaming shields, the flashing bronze.’ At this alarm I panicked: some unfriendly god’s power ripped away my tangled mind. For while I take a trackless path, deserting the customary roads, fate tears from me my wife Creiisa in my misery.

AENEID 901 “What men, what gods did I in madness not accuse? Did I see anything more cruel within the fallen city? I commit 280 Ascanius, Anchises, and the gods of Troy to my companions, hiding them inside a winding valley. I myself again seek out the city, girding on my gleaming arms. I want to meet all risks again, return through all of Troy, again give back my life to danger. First I seek the city walls, the gateway’s shadowed thresholds through which I had come before. And I retrace my footsteps; through the night I make them out. 290 My spirit is held by horror everywhere; even the very silence terrifies. Then I move homeward—if by chance, by chance, she may have made her way there. But the Danaans had flooded in and held the house. At once the hungry conflagration rolls before the wind, high as the highest rooftop; flames are towering overhead, the boiling tide is raging to the heavens. I go on; again I see the house of Priam and 300 the fortress. Down the empty porticoes, in Juno’s sanctuary, I can see both Phoenix and the fierce Ulysses, chosen as guardians, at watch over the booty. And here, from every quarter, heaped together, are Trojan treasures torn from burning altars — the tables of the gods, and plundered garments, and bowls of solid gold; and Trojan boys and trembling women stand in a long line. “And more, I even dared to cast my cries 310 across the shadows; in my sorrow, I— again, again, in vain—called for Creiisa; my shouting filled the streets. But as I rushed and raged among the houses endlessly, before my eyes there stood the effigy and grieving shade of my Creiisa, image far larger than the real.

Along your way lie long exile, vast plains of sea that you must plow; but you will reach Hesperia, where Lydian Tiber flows, a tranquil stream, through farmers’ fruitful fields. There days of gladness lie in wait for you: 330 a kingdom and a royal bride. Enough of tears for loved Creiisa. I am not to see the haughty homes of Myrmidons or of Dolopians, or be a slave to Grecian matrons—I, a Dardan woman and wife of Venus’ son. It is the gods’ great Mother who keeps me upon these shores. And now farewell, and love the son we share.’ “When she was done with words—I weeping and wanting to say so many things—she left 340 and vanished in transparent air. Three times I tried to throw my arms around her neck; three times the Shade I grasped in vain escaped my hands—like fleet winds, most like a winged dream. “Ajid so at last, when night has passed, I go again to my companions.

She feeds the wound within her veins; she is eaten by a secret flame. Aeneas’ high name, all he has done, again, again come like a flood. His face, his words hold fast her breast. Care strips her limbs of calm and rest. A new dawn lights the earth with Phoebus’ lamp and banishes damp shadows from the sky when restless Dido turns to her heart’s sharer; “Anna, my sister, what dreams make me shudder? 10 Who is this stranger guest come to our house? How confident he looks, how strong his chest and arms! I think—and I have cause—that he is born of gods. For in the face of fear the mean must fall. What fates have driven him! What trying wars he lived to tell! Were it not my sure, immovable decision not to marry anyone since my first love turned traitor, when he cheated me by death, were I not weary of the couch and torch, 20 I might perhaps give way to this one fault. For I must tell you, Anna, since the time Sychaeus, my poor husband, died and my own brother splashed our household gods with blood, Aeneas is the only man to move my feelings, to overturn my shifting heart. I know too well the signs of the old flame. But I should call upon the earth to gape and close above me, or on the almighty Father to take his thunderbolt, to hurl 30 me down into the shades, the pallid shadows and deepest night of Erebus, before I’d violate you. Shame, or break your laws! For he who first had joined me to himself has carried off my love, and may he keep it and be its guardian within the grave.” She spoke. Her breast became a well of tears.

Do you think that ashes or buried Shades will care about such matters? Until Aeneas came, there was no suitor who moved your sad heart—not in Libya nor, before, in Tyre: you always scorned larbas and all the other chiefs that Africa, a region rich in triumphs, had to offer. How can you struggle now against a love that is so acceptable? Have you forgotten the land you settled, those who hem you in? On one side lie the towns of the Gaetulians, a race invincible, and the unbridled Numidians and then the barbarous Syrtis. And on the other lies a barren countrv, stripped by the drought and by Barcaean raiders, raging both far and near. And I need not remind you of the wars that boil in Tyre and of your brother’s menaces and plots. For I am sure it was the work of gods and Juno that has held the Trojan galleys fast to their course and brought them here to Carthage. If you marry Aeneas, what a city and what a kingdom, sister, you will see! With Trojan arms beside us, so much greatness must lie in wait for Punic glory! Only pray to the gods for their good will, and having presented them with proper sacrifices, be lavish with your Trojan guests and weave excuses for delay while frenzied winter storms out across the sea and shatters ships, while wet Orion blows his tempest squalls beneath a sky that is intractable.” These words of Anna fed the fire in Dido. Hope burned away her doubt, destroyed her shame. First they moved on from shrine to shrine, imploring the favor of the gods at every altar. They slaughter chosen sheep, as is the custom, and offer them to Ceres the lawgiver, to Phoebus, Father Bacchus, and—above all— to Juno, guardian of marriage. Lovely Dido holds the cup in her right hand; she pours the offering herself, midway between a milk-white heifer’s horns. She studies slit breasts of beasts and reads their throbbing guts. But oh the ignorance of augurs! How can vows and altars help one wild with love? 50 60 70 80"},{"pageNumber":941,"pageContent":"Meanwhile the supple flame devours her marrow; within her breast the silent wound lives on. Unhappy Dido burns. Across the city she wanders in her frenzy— even as a heedless hind hit by an arrow when a shepherd drives for game with darts among the Cretan woods and, unawares, from far leaves winging steel inside her flesh; she roams the forests and the wooded slopes of Dicte, the shaft of death still clinging to her side. So Dido leads Aeneas around the ramparts, displays the wealth of Sidon and the city ready to hand; she starts to speak, then falters and stops in midspeech. Now day glides away. Again, insane, she seeks out that same banquet, again she prays to hear the trials of Troy, again she hangs upon the teller’s lips. But now the guests are gone. The darkened moon, in turn, conceals its light, the setting stars invite to sleep; inside the vacant hall she grieves alone and falls upon the couch that he has left. Absent, she sees, she hears the absent one or draws Ascanius, his son and counterfeit, into her arms, as if his shape might cheat her unreliable love. Her towers rise no more; the young of Carthage no longer exercise at arms or build their harbors or sure battlements for war; the works are idle, broken off; the massive, menacing rampart walls, even the crane, defier of the sky, now lie neglected. As soon as Jove’s dear wife sees that her Dido is in the grip of such a scourge and that no honor can withstand this madness, then the daughter of Saturn faces Venus: “How remarkable indeed: what splendid spoils you carry off, you and your boy; how grand and memorable is the glory if one woman is beaten by the guile of two gods. I have not been blind. I know you fear our fortresses, you have been suspicious of the houses of high Carthage. But what end will come of all this hate? Let us be done with wrangling.

Then let us rule this people—you and I— with equal auspices; let Dido serve a Phrygian husband, let her give her Tyrians and her pledged dowry into your right hand.” But Venus read behind the words of Juno the motive she had hid: to shunt the kingdom 140 of Italy to Libyan shores. And so she answered Juno: “Who is mad enough to shun the terms you offer? Who would prefer to strive with you in war? If only fortune favor the course you urge. For I am ruled by fates and am unsure if Jupiter would have the Trojans and the men of Tyre become one city, if he likes the mingling of peoples and the writing of such treaties. But you are his wife and it is right for you 150 to try his mind, to entreat him. Go. I’ll follow.” Queen Juno answered her: “That task is mine. But listen now while in few words I try to tell you how I mean to bring about this urgent matter. When tomorrow’s Titan first shows his rays of light, reveals the world, Aeneas and unhappy Dido plan to hunt together in the forest. Then while horsemen hurry to surround the glades with nets, I shall pour down a black raincloud, 160 in which I have mixed hail, to awaken all the heavens with my thundering. Their comrades will scatter under cover of thick night. Both Dido and the Trojan chief will reach their shelter in the same cave. I shall be there. And if I can rely on your goodwill, I shall unite the two in certain marriage and seal her as Aeneas’ very own; and this shall be their wedding.” Cytherea said nothing to oppose the plan; she granted 170 what Juno wanted, smiling at its cunning. Meanwhile Aurora rose; she left the Ocean. And when her brightness fills the air, select young men move from the gates with wide-meshed nets and narrow snares and broad-blade hunting spears, and then Massylian horsemen hurry out with strong, keen-scented hounds.

Her splendid stallion, in gold and purple, prances, proudly champing his foaming bit. At last the queen appears among the mighty crowd; upon her shoulders she wears a robe of Sidon with embroidered borders. Her quiver is of gold, her hair has knots and ties of gold, a golden clasp holds fast her purple cloak. Her Trojan comrades and glad Ascanius advance behind her. Aeneas, who is handsome past all others, himself approaches now to join her, linking his hunting band to hers. Just as Apollo, when in the winter he abandoned Lycia and Xanthus’ streams to visit his maternal Delos, where he renews the dances — Cretans, Dryopians, and painted Agathyrsi, mingling around the altars, shout—advances upon the mountain ridges of high Cynthus and binds his flowing hair with gentle leaves and braids its strands with intertwining gold; his arrows clatter on his shoulder: no less graceful is Aeneas as he goes; an equal beauty fills his splendid face. And when they reach the hills and pathless thickets, the wild she-goats, dislodged from stony summits, run down the ridges; from another slope stags fling themselves across the open fields; they mass their dusty bands in flight, forsaking the hillsides. But the boy Ascanius rides happy in the valleys on his fiery stallion as he passes on his course now stags, now goats; among the lazy herds his prayer is for a foaming boar or that a golden lion come down from the mountain. Meanwhile confusion takes the sky, tremendous turmoil, and on its heels, rain mixed with hail. The scattered train of Tyre, the youth of Troy, and Venus’ Dardan grandson in alarm seek different shelters through the fields; the torrents roar down the mountains. Dido and the Trojan chieftain have reached the same cave. Primal Earth and Juno, queen of marriages, together now give the signal: lightning fires flash, the upper air is witness to their mating, and from the highest hilltops shout the nymphs.

For Dido calls it marriage, and with this name she covers up her fault. Then, swiftest of all evils. Rumor runs straightway through Libya’s mighty cities—Rumor, 230 whose life is speed, whose going gives her force. Timid and small at first, she soon lifts up her body in the air. She stalks the ground; her head is hidden in the clouds. Provoked to anger at the gods, her mother Earth gave birth to her, last come—they say—as sister to Coeus and Enceladus; fast-footed and lithe of wing, she is a terrifying enormous monster with as many feathers as she has sleepless eyes beneath each feather 240 (amazingly), as many sounding tongues and mouths, and raises up as many ears. Between the earth and skies she flies by night, screeching across the darkness, and she never closes her eyes in gentle sleep. By day she sits as sentinel on some steep roof or on high towers, frightening vast cities; for she holds fast to falsehood and distortion as often as to messages of truth. Now she was glad. She filled the ears of all 250 with many tales. She sang of what was done and what was fiction, chanting that Aeneas, one born of Trojan blood, had come, that lovely Dido has deigned to join herself to him, that now, in lust, forgetful of their kingdom, they take long pleasure, fondling through the winter, the slaves of squalid craving. Such reports the filthy goddess scatters everywhere upon the lips of men. At once she turns her course to King larbas; and his spirit 260 is hot, his anger rages at her words, larbas was the son of Hammon by a ravished nymph of Garamantia. In his broad realm he had built a hundred temples, a hundred handsome shrines for Jupiter. There he had consecrated sleepless fire, the everlasting watchman of the gods; the soil was rich with blood of slaughtered herds, and varied garlands flowered on the thresholds. Insane, incited by that bitter rumor, he prayed long—so they say—to Jupiter; 270"},{"pageNumber":945,"pageContent":"he stood before the altars in the presence of gods, a suppliant with upraised hands: “All-able Jove, to whom the Moorish nation, feasting upon their figured couches, pour Lenaean sacrifices, do you see these things?

Those fires in the clouds that terrify our souls—are they but blind and aimless lightning that only stirs our empty mutterings? A woman, wandering within our borders, paid for the right to build a tiny city. We gave her shore to till and terms of tenure. She has refused to marry me, she has taken Aeneas as a lord into her lands. And now this second Paris, with his crew of half-men, with his chin and greasy hair bound up beneath a bonnet of Maeonia, enjoys his prey; while we bring offerings to what we have believed to be your temples, still cherishing your empty reputation.” And as he prayed and clutched the altar stone, all-able Jupiter heard him and turned his eyes upon the royal walls, upon the lovers who had forgotten their good name. He speaks to Mercury, commanding him: “Be on your way, my son, call up the Zephyrs, glide on your wings, speak to the Dardan chieftain who lingers now at Tyrian Carthage, paying not one jot of attention to the cities the Fates have given him. Mercury, carry across the speeding winds the words I urge: his lovely mother did not promise such a son to us; she did not save him twice from Grecian arms for this—but to be master of Italy, a land that teems with empire and seethes with war; to father a race from Teucer’s high blood, to place all earth beneath his laws. But if the brightness of such deeds is not enough to kindle him, if he cannot attempt the task for his own fame, does he— a father—grudge Ascanius the walls of Rome?

First 320 he laces on his golden sandals: winged to bear him, swift as whirlwinds, high across the land and water. Then he takes his wand; with this he calls pale spirits up from Orcus and down to dreary Tartarus sends others; he uses this to give sleep and recall it, and to unseal the eyes of those who have died. His trust in this, he spurs the winds and skims the troubled clouds. And now in flight, he sights the summit and high sides of hardy Atlas 330 who props up heaven with his crest—Atlas, whose head is crowned with pines and battered by the wind and rain and always girdled by black clouds; his shoulders’ cloak is falling snow; above the old man’s chin the rivers rush; his bristling beard is stiff with ice. Here first Cyllene’s god poised on his even wings and halted; then he hurled himself headlong and seaward with his body, like a bird that, over shores and reefs where fishes throng, 340 swoops low along the surface of the waters. Not unlike this, Cyllene’s god between the earth and heaven as he flies, cleaving the sandy shore of Libya from the winds that sweep from Atlas, father of his mother. As soon as his winged feet have touched the outskirts, he sees Aeneas founding fortresses and fashioning new houses. And his sword was starred with tawny jasper, and the cloak that draped his shoulders blazed with Tyrian purple— 350 a gift that wealthy Dido wove for him; she had run golden thread along the web. And Mercury attacks at once. “Are you now laying the foundation of high Carthage, as servant to a woman, building her a splendid city here? Are you forgetful of what is your own kingdom, your own fate? The very god of gods, whose power sways both earth and heaven, sends me down to you from bright Olympus.

He left 370 the sight of mortals even as he spoke and vanished into the transparent air. This vision stunned Aeneas, struck him dumb; his terror held his hair erect; his voice held fast within his jaws. He burns to flee from Carthage; he would quit these pleasant lands, astonished by such warnings, the command of gods. What can he do? With what words dare he face the frenzied queen? What openings can he employ? His wits are split, they shift 380 here, there; they race to different places, turning to everything. But as he hesitated, this seemed the better plan: he calls Sergestus and Mnestheus and the strong Serestus, and he asks them to equip the fleet in silence, to muster their companions on the shore, to ready all their arms, but to conceal the reasons for this change; while he himself— with gracious Dido still aware of nothing and never dreaming such a love could ever 390 be broken—would try out approaches, seek the tenderest, most tactful time for speech, whatever dexterous way might suit his case. And all are glad. They race to carry out the orders of Aeneas, his commands. But Dido — for who can deceive a lover?— had caught his craftiness; she quickly sensed what was to come; however safe they seemed, she feared all things. That same unholy Rumor brought her these hectic tidings: that the boats 400 were being armed, made fit for voyaging. Her mind is helpless; raging frantically, inflamed, she raves throughout the city—just as a Bacchante when, each second year, she is startled by the shaking of the sacred emblems, the orgies urge her on, the cry “o Bacchus” calls to her by night; Cithaeron incites her with its clamor.

Even if you were not seeking out strange flelds and unknown dwellings, even if your ancient Troy were still erect, would you 420 return to Troy across such stormy seas? Do you flee me? By tears, by your right hand— this sorry self is left with nothing else— by wedding, by the marriage we began, if I did anything deserving of you or anything of mine was sweet to you, take pity on a fallen house, put off your plan, I pray—if there is still place for prayers. Because of you the tribes of Libya, all the Nomad princes hate me, even my 430 own Tyrians are hostile; and for you my honor is gone and that good name that once was mine, my only claim to reach the stars.

But Aeneas, warned by Jove, held still his eyes; he struggled, pressed care back within his breast. With halting words he answers her at last: “I never shall deny what you deserve, the kindnesses 450 that you could tell; I never shall regret remembering Elissa for as long as I remember my own self, as long as breath is king over these limbs.

But now Grynean Apollo’s oracle would have me seize great Italy, the Lycian prophecies tell me of Italy: there is my love, there is my homeland. If the fortresses of Carthage and the vision of a city in Libya can hold you, who are Phoenician, why, then, begrudge the Trojans’ settling on Ausonian soil? There is no harm: it is right that we, too, seek out a foreign kingdom.

Then Dido thus, inflamed, denounces him: “No goddess was your mother, false Aeneas, and Dardanus no author of your race; the bristling Caucasus was father to you on his harsh crags; Hyrcanian tigresses gave you their teats.

Depraved, you then will pay your penalties. 530 And I shall hear of it, and that report will come to me below, among the Shadows.” Her speech is broken off; heartsick, she shuns the light of day, deserts his eyes; she turns away, leaves him in fear and hesitation, Aeneas longing still to say so much. As Dido faints, her servants lift her up; they carry her into her marble chamber; they lay her body down upon the couch.

I mean to offer unto Stygian Jove the sacrifices that, as is ordained, I have made ready and begun, to put an end to my disquiet and commit to flames the pyre of the Trojan chieftain.” So Dido spoke. And Barce hurried off; she moved with an old woman’s eagerness. But Dido, desperate, beside herself with awful undertakings, eyes bloodshot and rolling, and her quivering cheeks flecked with stains and pale with coming death, now bursts across the inner courtyards of her palace. She mounts in madness that high pyre, unsheathes the Dardan sword, a gift not sought for such an end. And when she saw the Trojan’s clothes and her familiar bed, she checked her thought and tears a little, lay upon the couch and spoke her final words: “O relics, dear while fate and god allowed, receive my spirit and free me from these cares; for I have lived and journeyed through the course assigned by fortune. And now my Shade will pass, illustrious, beneath the earth; I have built a handsome city, have seen my walls rise up, avenged a husband. 550 560 570 580 590"},{"pageNumber":952,"pageContent":"916 VIRGIL won satisfaction from a hostile brother: o fortunate, too fortunate—if only the ships of Troy had never touched our coasts.” She spoke and pressed her face into the couch. “I shall die unavenged, but I shall die,” she says, “Thus, thus, I gladly go below to shadows. May the savage Dardan drink 600 with his own eyes this fire from the deep and take with him the omen of my death.” Then Dido’s words were done, and her companions can see her fallen on the sword; the blade is foaming with her blood, her hands are bloodstained. Now clamor rises to the high rooftop. Now rumor riots through the startled city. The lamentations, keening, shrieks of women sound through the houses; heavens echo mighty wailings, even as if an enemy 610 were entering the gates, with all of Carthage or ancient Tyre in ruins, and angry fires rolling across the homes of men and gods.

Trojan Aeneas, famed for piety and arms, descends to meet his father, down into the deepest shades of Erebus. And if the image of such piety is not enough to move you, then”—and here she shows the branch concealed beneath her robe— “you may yet recognize this bough.” At this the swollen heart of Charon stills its anger. He says no more. He wonders at the sacred gift of the destined wand, so long unseen, and turns his blue-black keel toward shore. He clears the other spirits from the gangways and long benches and, meanwhile, admits the massive Aeneas to the boat, the vessel’s seams groaning beneath the weight as they let in marsh water through the chinks. At last he sets the priestess and the soldier safe across the stream in ugly slime and blue-gray sedge. These regions echo with the triple-throated bark of the giant Cerberus, who crouches, enormous, in a cavern facing them. The Sibyl, seeing that his neck is bristling with snakes, throws him a honeyed cake of wheat with drugs that bring on sleep. His triple mouths yawn wide with rapid hunger as he clutches the cake she cast. His giant back falls slack along the ground; his bulk takes all the cave. And when the beast is buried under sleep, Aeneas gains the entrance swiftly, leaves the riverbank from which no one returns.

The land that lies beyond belongs to those who, although innocent, took death by their own hands; hating the light, they threw away 70 their lives. But now they long for the upper air, and even to bear want and trials there. But fate refuses them: the melancholy marshland, its ugly waters, hem them in, the prisoners of Styx and its nine circles. Nearby, spread out on every side, there lie the Fields of Mourning: this, their given name. And here, concealed by secret paths, are those whom bitter love consumed with brutal waste; a myrtle grove encloses them; their pains 80 remain with them in death. Aeneas sees Phaedra and Procris and sad Eriphyle, who pointed to the wounds inflicted by her savage son; he sees Pasiphae and then Evadne; and Laodamia and Caeneus, once a youth and now a woman, changed back again by fate to her first shape. Among them, wandering in that great forest, and with her wound still fresh: Phoenician Dido. And when the Trojan hero recognized her 90 dim shape among the shadows (just as one who either sees or thinks he sees among the cloud banks, when the month is young, the moon rising), he wept and said with tender love: “Unhappy Dido, then the word I had was true?

She turned away, eyes to the ground, her face no more moved by his speech than if she stood as stubborn flint or some Marpessan crag. At last she tore herself away; she fled— and still his enemy—into the forest of shadows, where Sychaeus, once her husband, answers her sorrows, gives her love for love. Nevertheless, Aeneas, stunned by her unkindly fate, still follows at a distance with tears and pity for her as she goes. He struggles on his given way again. Now they have reached the borderlands of this first region, the secluded home of those renowned in war. Here he encounters Tydeus, Parthenopaeus, famous soldier, and the pale shade of Adrastus; here are men mourned in the upper world, the Dardan captains fallen in battle. And for all of these, on seeing them in long array, he grieves: for Glaucus, Medon, and Thersilochus, the three sons of Antenor; Polyboetes, who was a priest of Ceres; and Idaeus, still clinging to his chariot, his weapons. The spirits crowd Aeneas right and left, and it is not enough to see him once; they want to linger, to keep step with him, to learn the reasons for his visit there. But when the Grecian chieftains and the hosts of Agamemnon see the hero and his weapons glittering across the shadows, they tremble with an overwhelming terror; some turn their backs in flight, as when they once sought out their ships; some raise a thin war cry; the voice they now have mocks their straining throats.

For here the road divides 210 in two directions: on the right it runs beneath the ramparts of great Dis, this is our highway to Elysium; the wicked are punished on the left—that path leads down to godless Tartarus.” Deiphobus: “Do not be angry, mighty priestess, I now leave to fill the count, return to darkness. Go on, our glory, go; know better fates.” He said no more; his steps turned at these words. Aeneas suddenly looks back; beneath 220 a rock upon his left he sees a broad fortress encircled by a triple wall and girdled by a rapid flood of flames that rage: Tartarean Phlegethon whirling resounding rocks. A giant gateway stands in front, with solid adamantine pillars— no force of man, not even heaven’s sons, enough to level these in war; a tower of iron rises in the air; there sits Tisiphone, who wears a bloody mantle. 230 She guards the entrance, sleepless night and day.

Fiercer still, the monstrous Hydra lives inside; her fifty black mouths are gaping. Tartarus itself 260 then plunges downward, stretching twice as far as is the view to heaven, high Olympus. And here the ancient family of Earth, the sons of Titan who had been cast down by thunderbolts, writhe in the deepest gulf. Here, too, I saw the giant bodies of the twin sons of Aloeus, those who tried to rip high heaven with their hands, to harry Jove from his realms above.

The ancient race of Teucer, too, is here, most handsome sons, great-hearted heroes born in better years: Assaracus and Ilus and Dardanus, who founded Pergamus. From far Aeneas wonders at their phantom armor and chariots; their spears are planted, fixed in the ground; their horses graze and range freely across the plain. The very same 360 delight that once was theirs in life—in arms and chariots and care to pasture their sleek steeds—has followed to this underearth. And here to right and left he can see others: some feasting on the lawns; and some chanting glad choral paeans in a fragrant laurel grove. Starting here, Eridanus in flood flows through a forest to the world above. Fiere was the company of those who suffered wounds, fighting for their homeland; and of those 370 who, while they lived their lives, served as pure priests; and then the pious poets, those whose songs were worthy of Apollo; those who had made life more civilized with newfound arts; and those whose merits won the memory of men: all these were crowned with snow-white garlands.

And as it happened, he was telling over the multitude of all his dear descendants, his heroes’ fates and fortunes, works and ways. And when he saw Aeneas cross the meadow, 400 he stretched out both hands eagerly, the tears ran down his cheeks, these words fell from his lips: “And have you come at last, and has the pious love that your father waited for defeated the difficulty of the journey? Son, can I look at your face, hear and return familiar accents? So indeed I thought, imagining this time to come, counting the moments, and my longing did not cheat me. What lands and what wide waters have you journeyed 4io to make this meeting possible? My son, what dangers battered you?

Countless tribes and peoples were hovering there: as in the meadows, when the summer is serene, the bees will settle upon the many-colored flowers and crowd the dazzling lilies—all the plain is murmuring. 430 The sudden sight has startled him.

Are they madmen? Why this wild longing for the light of earth?” “Son, you will have the answer; I shall not keep you in doubt,” Anchises starts and then reveals to him each single thing in order. 450 “First, know, a soul within sustains the heaven and earth, the plains of water, and the gleaming globe of the moon, the Titan sun, the stars; and mind, that pours through every member, mingles with that great body.

Just as a rock when, from a mountaintop, it hurtles headlong, having been torn up by wind or washed away by a wheeling storm or loosened by the long lapse of the years; the mass, enormous, with a mighty thrust drives down the slope and bounds upon the earth. 10 20 30 40"},{"pageNumber":967,"pageContent":"AENEID 931 rolls woods and herds and men along its course: so Turnus rushes through the scattered bands up to the city walls, there where the ground is soaked in shed blood and the air is shrill with shafts.

But when he hears the name of Turnus, father Aeneas leaves the ramparts and tall towers; he casts aside delay, breaks off the siege; and now, exultant, joyous, and tremendous, he pounds upon his shield—as huge as Athos, as Eryx, or as father Apenninus himself when, roaring, with his trembling oaks he lifts his snow-topped summit skyward, glad. Now all—Rutulians, Trojans, and Italians— turned eagerly to look: both those who manned high battlements and those below, who ran a battering ram against the walls; they slung their weapons off their shoulders. King Latinus himself is wonderstruck to see such giant men—born within such distant, different lands— now come together for this trial by steel. And they, as soon as space was cleared for them along the open plain, first fling their spears from far, then swiftly rush to fight; they dash the brass of clanging shields together. Earth groans, and their frequent sword blows double; chance and courage mingle into one.

Ffeedless of this custom, the Teucrians had carried off the sacred tree trunk to clear the field, to lay it bare for battle.

Just as in dreams of night, when languid rest has closed our eyes, we seem in vain to wish to press on down a path, but as we strain, we falter, weak; our tongues can say nothing, the body loses its familiar force, no voice, no word, can follow: so whatever courage he calls upon to find a way, the cursed goddess keeps success from Turnus.

Sometimes comic, sometimes bitter in tone, his tales por- tray the world of myth (and, some would say, the world of Augustan Rome) as a place where everything — l ove, the gods, and time itself—changes and thus betrays one’s hopes and expectations. The only way to cope with such constant flux is to be transformed into something immobile (like the laurel tree in ‘Apollo and Daphne” in Book 1) or inanimate (like the human statues in “The Story of Perseus” in Book 5). The tales are framed by a vision of Rome and end with “The Deiflcation of Caesar” (Book 15) and the poet’s hope that Rome will endure forever—so that he can have a per- petual audience for his poems! Ovid In the case of the poet Ovid (43 B.C.-A.D. 17), the connection between myth and politics turned all too literal. Something in Ovid s elegant and witty writings (which included such works as the Art of Love and the collection of tales called Metamor- phoses —a retelling of many Greek myths) apparently offended Augustus, who ban- ished Ovid from Rome, forcing him to spend his last decade in exile in a little town on the shores of the Black Sea. Perhaps Augustus found that Ovid s worldly, some- times comic, and sometimes cynical depictions of the lecherous pursuits of gods and humans too obviously undermined the “ofhciar’ image of a sober Roman citizenry 939"},{"pageNumber":976,"pageContent":"940 The World of Roman Myth and its politically correct deities. More likely, Ovid’s love poems put the sexual ex- ploits of Augustus’s immediate family, especially his daughter Julia, in the public spotlight. The Metamorphoses: The Story of Creation Sisnificdnt Themes and Characters Ovid’s theme in Metamorphoses is “bodies changed.” One of the most remarkable aspects of the poem is that, instead of an anthology of separate myths, Ovid created a series of narrative links that allow one tale to flow into another in a continuous stream, thus reflecting his theme of transformations in the structure of the poem itself. Like Hesiod, he begins with the story of creation—the changes in the body of the cosmos itself. Ovid’s universe, like Hesiod’s, is in a state of perpetual flux—only more so. He describes a world in which Time dissolves all—even the globe of earth itself— to water, to air, to fire, and back to earth again, just as human figures in the myths change from human to animal and other forms and just as Troy is transformed into Rome. The changes in Ovid’s universe, however, move largely in one direction: from chaos to order, from motion to stasis. In Hesiod’s description of creation, primal chaos is depicted with a certain exuberance, as Hesiod celebrates, in his catalogues and genealogies, the proliferation of life. For Ovid, in contrast, chaos is an intolerable condition in which the very atoms of the universe war with one another. It is not until god, or nature, separates the warring components of the universe—decreeing a proper place for each in the eternal order, subdividing all creation and, as might be expected from Roman gods, marking out boundaries—that Ovid can celebrate the emergence of the stars. The bureaucratically organized universe thus produced is di- vided into zones just as Rome was divided into wards. The boundaries between social classes, even among the gods, is as essential to the proper order as are the borders between zones and territories. Even the dwellings of the gods on Olympus are segre- gated into neighborhoods, with the lesser gods inhabiting a poorer section. The Comic Tone As some scholars have noted, in such references to contemporary Roman society, Ovid is poking fun at Augustus (who, along with other very important Romans, lived on the Palatine Hill), equating him with Jupiter and perhaps satirizing the folly and pretentiousness of the Augustan court. Hoping to add dignity to Roman life and presumably to enhance his own reputation, Augustus had attempted to revive not only neglected Roman religious rites but even the worship of the Greek god Apollo. He also sought to impose moral restraints on a society whose elite patrician class was used to a lifestyle characterized by various kinds of self-indulgence. In 18 B.C., for example, Augustus made adultery a crime; however, he was subsequently embarrassed by the blatantly licentious behavior of his daughter Julia and, to carry out his own laws, had to banish her from Rome. His granddaughter was banished for the same reason. As several modern readers have pointed out, there is an element of bathos (a sudden dropping off in tone) as Ovid moves immediately from describing Mount"},{"pageNumber":977,"pageContent":"Ovid's Metamorphoses 941 Olympus to a reference to the Palatine Hill. Indeed, throughout much of the Meta- morphoses, there is an undercurrent of downsizing of the myths, bringing them down to the level of ordinary experience, and an element of parody, mocking the foibles of the gods, the follies and hypocrisies of Augustan society, and perhaps even Augustus himself. Echo and Narcissus In the story of Echo and Narcissus, Ovid describes the twin follies of Echo, a woman whose discourse was so dependent on others’ that she was unable either to begin or to end a conversation on her own initiative, and Narcissus, an unusually beautiful young man who was so self-absorbed that he was incapable of relating to any other being, male or female, human or divine. Ovid tells how Echo serves Jove by chattering to distract Juno while Jove makes love to nameless nymphs. She thus incurs Juno’s anger. The goddess punishes Echo by rendering her capable only of repeating the last statement she has heard, exagger- ating the reflective characteristics already present in Echo’s speech. Echo falls in love with Narcissus, an odd pairing of complementary foibles: the woman who cannot express what is inside herself paired with the man who cannot respond to anything outside himself. But the slightly comical overtones of that initial ironic juxtaposition soon give way to a far bleaker perspective. Narcissus of course rejects Echo, as he rejects all the women and young men who pursue him, his lack of capacity for love an insult to the powers of Aphrodite and Eros. Persistent but end- lessly frustrated in her hopeless pursuit of Narcissus, Echo is gradually reduced to the condition of a disembodied voice. Meanwhile, one of the young men Narcissus has rejected prays that Narcissus himself will come to feel tormented by the pains of unrequited love he has caused in so many others. Carrying to its most extreme form the self-infatuation of Narcissus, the goddess of vengeance, Nemesis, causes Narcissus to fall in love with his own reflection on the surface of a pond, as if Eros, denied an external object, turns inward, with deadly results. Like Echo, Narcissus is disembodied, dissolving into the watery image of himself visible on the pond’s surface, until nothing is left of him but the flower that still bears his name (see Color Plate 16). The Golden Age As is often the case in satire, beneath the witty, comic surface lurks a more serious indictment, as Ovid moves beyond folly to vice, from the ludicrous to the vicious, resulting in a dual vision between whose perspectives the poet can range at will. Like Hesiod, Ovid tells the myth of the Ages of Man (Book 1). But Ovid gives equal attention to those aspects of Roman life for which the Golden Age had no need: judges, laws, and punishments; ships, soldiers, and weapons; aggression and anxiety. In contrast, Ovid somewhat ambivalently, and occasionally even bitterly, presents the Iron Age of contemporary Rome, characterized by greed, war, violence, and those very important Roman figures—surveyors—who marked off the boundaries of pri- vate property. Caught between the terror of anarchy and the almost equally fright- ening “threat” of law, the Romans—even a poet who had experienced personally just how fearful the law can be—dreaded disorder more. The role of government, then."},{"pageNumber":978,"pageContent":"942 The World of Roman Myth in this fallen world of the Iron Age, is to use the force of law and, if necessary, of arms to impose order on an anarchic world. The subtle tension exhibited in Virgil’s Aeneid between the fear of chaos and the fear of law—the moments of fleeting suspicion that perhaps the price paid for the benefits of Roman civilization might have been too high—becomes even more explicit in Ovid’s works and is reflected in the char- acteristic Roman nostalgia for the Golden Age, or the early republic. The Nightmare World In Ovid’s poem, however, the nostalgic impulse is short-lived. In a more sinister vein, many of Ovid’s tales move beyond follies to vices, portraying a nightmarish world characterized by lust, rape, betrayal, and revenge. Several scholars, having made the link between Jupiter and Augustus in the earlier sections of the poem, now see these more appalling stories as comments on the cruelty of those in power—of the Augus- tan state and the emperor himself It is difficult to say, in these cases in which the poet himself omits the obvious hints of the comic tales, whether he intended such a comment. It is clear, however, in this world in which gods turn on humans, that cruelty and violence are so pervasive that the only escape possible is through transfor- mation into less-than-human or even inanimate states beyond the reach of pain. If Aeneas can be said, as some of Virgil’s modern readers claim, to have been emotion- ally dehumanized by his experience, Ovid’s mythic characters are literally so. Men and women, driven by uncontrollable inner urges or pursued by individuals—or gods—who are thus driven, are saved only by being changed into trees, rocks, or even constellations. Perseus In “The Story of Perseus” (Books 4—5), we can see most blatantly this compulsion toward immobility. Whereas, for example, Odysseus was content to fight a hundred suitors one at a time, Perseus, in Ovid’s retelling, finds that method too exhausting and thus inefficient. Instead, he whips out the Gorgon’s head and transforms all of Andromeda’s former suitors to stone. Although that mass transformation is, of course, part of the ancient Greek Perseus myth, Ovid goes on to describe, in stark detail, the suitors’ tears frozen on their faces for eternity. And Perseus, in a marvelous comic touch, offers the marble “statue” of her former fiance to Andromeda, to set up in her new home. But the image also conveys the more serious theme of the desperate striving for permanence. In these men-turned-statues, we can see, in its most literal form, the Roman petrification of Greek myth. And, of course, Perseus and An- dromeda are themselves eventually honored by becoming constellations. Apollo and Daphne Traditional Roman heroes like Romulus and Aeneas are, in Ovid’s version, trans- formed into gods. But not even the gods themselves are exempt from the inevitable failures of sensual love. The gods’ desires, like those of the humans, remain unful- filled, as the objects of their desire turn into beasts, trees, or flowers before their outstretched hands. Apollo, for instance, may be the god of archery, but he is himself"},{"pageNumber":979,"pageContent":"Ovid’s Metamorphoses 943 FIGURE 20-1 Apollo and Daphne. In this marble statue (1622-1625), the Italian sculptor Gianlorenzo Bernini depicts the erotic pursuit of Daphne by the god Apollo. Responding to his daughter’s plea to be rescued from the impending rape, Daphne’s father, a river god, turns her into a laurel tree. Bernini’s sculpture captures the moment of transformation of Daphne into the laurel tree: just as Apollo’s hand arrests her flight, her forward motion is thrust up- ward. Her hair, still flowing as she twists to avoid him, sprouts leaves, and the bark begins enclosing her legs and trunk, protecting her as it immobilizes her.

But that proves small consolation to the god, who, instead of achieving erotic bliss, finds himself rather foolishly embracing the trunk of a tree (Figure 20-1). Because of Augustus’s particular interest in reviving the worship of Apollo along with other elements of Greek culture, some scholars see in this tale an attempt to mock Augustus’s plans by portraying the god whom he admires as ridiculous. But to Daphne, who, to escape a “fate worse than death,” must be dehumanized, the consequences are anything but comical."},{"pageNumber":980,"pageContent":"944 The World of Roman Myth Orpheus and Eurydice Unlike Echo and Narcissus, who are incapable of love, Orpheus and Eurydice fail to fulfill their love because of forces beyond their, or anyone’s, control. At the very moment of their marriage, Eurydice is bitten by a serpent, associated with the chthonic figure of Medusa, “rough with snakes.” The “poison of the serpent,” death itself, takes Eurydice, and she dies. Her distraught husband/lover, the musician Or- pheus, does what the warrior-heroes used to do: he descends to the Underworld. But whereas those heroes typically made such quests to escape domesticity, Orpheus, in- verting the usual heroic mode, makes the journey to retrieve his wife. Indeed, more like Demeter seeking reunion with Persephone than like a Heracles or a Theseus seeking his own immortality, Orpheus even offers to die himself if Eurydice cannot be released from the Underworld. Thus, he refuses the warrior’s defiant stance: he does not come, he insists, to bind the “triple-throated” hound, Cerberus. Trusting that, because love is “famous” in the upper world, it will be similarly honored in the lower, Orpheus appeals to Hades and Persephone, in light of their love for each other, to release Eurydice. Attempting to pursue love beyond the grave, Orpheus brings together the forces of Eros (love) and Thanatos (death). But Orpheus is not in love with death; rather, his descent to the Underworld is a variant of the mythic tradition that embraces such couples as Venus and Adonis, the Egyptian lovers Isis and Osiris, or the Babylonian lovers Ishtar and Tammuz. In those stories, it is usually the goddess who reaches beyond death to bring her consort back from the Underworld to some form of rebirth. All people, Orpheus argues, belong to the Underworld eventually: he just wants Eurydice’s death to happen later, “in the ripeness of years.” What has betrayed these lovers is change, time itself For a brief interval, as Orpheus charms the inhabitants of the Underworld with his music, time does seem to stop: the Furies themselves weep, and the punishments of sinners in Tartarus cease. For a moment, Orpheus’s request to stop time, or to reverse it—to undo death—is granted, on one condition: he must not look back as he leads Eurydice up again to the world of light. But it is impossible for Orpheus not to look back. Indeed, he already has done so: the descent into the Underworld, an attempt to reverse time, itself constitutes a looking back. And whereas the traditional warrior-hero achieves a form of rebirth as a result of his trip to the Underworld, no such results occur during the hero’s life in this tale. Unlike many of the later versions of the story of Orpheus and Eurydice, in which Orpheus turns back because he distrusts either the gods or Eurydice herself, Ovid’s Orpheus explicitly turns back “in love.” Nor does Eurydice reproach her husband for doing so. Nevertheless, “in a moment,” the poet tells us, Eurydice is gone. Even mutual and seemingly perfect love is not eternal. The ultimate dissolution of the self in death is the final metamorphosis: death is the ultimate betrayal. Having lost Eurydice, Orpheus rejects the love of women and turns to young men instead. As he wanders the hills playing his lyre, Orpheus appears to have acquired a function akin to a fertility god: trees appear in his wake, reminding us of Orpheus’s similarities to Demeter and Dionysus. Thus, Orpheus incorporates qualities of both Apollo, god of music, and Dionysus, the “twice-born” agricultural god.

The juxtaposition in the poem—of the trees into which Apollo’s lovers are transformed and the trees that spring up on the hills where Orpheus wanders—suggests that the hills are littered with the trans- formed remnants of Orpheus’s male lovers as well. The Death of Orpheus Delaying the story of the death of Orpheus and returning to it later, immediately after the story of Venus and Adonis, Ovid implies a link between the two stories of Underworld experiences. According to the tradition that Ovid describes, Orpheus is killed and mutilated by maenads, women who followed Orpheus as they did Dio- nysus. Angered by his rejection of women, they silence his lyre—his Apollonian voice—which is rendered, for the first time, useless. The women then perform a sparagmos ritual in which Orpheus, like Dionysus, is torn limb from limb; he is also compared to Actaeon, the “doomed stag” destroyed by the women whom Ovid com- pares to Actaeon’s hounds. Orpheus’s head, along with his lyre, is flung into a river, from which it is rescued by Apollo himself, who “freezes” it, performing the only form of metamorphosis still possible: he turns it, gaping jaws and all, to stone. Ovid’s description of that transfor- mation to a condition of stillness, beyond the reach of change, is reminiscent of his treatment of the story of Perseus, whose rivals were similarly petrified. Throughout Ovid’s version of the Orpheus myth, some sort of rivalry is suggested between Apollo, who communicates in mediated form through the voice of another (the Oracle at Delphi, the lyre), and Dionysus (Bacchus) whose unmediated epiph- anies the maenads have experienced, but which Orpheus has denied them. In Ovid’s tale, however, the two gods—dual aspects of Orpheus himself—are reconciled. Bac- chus, mourning Orpheus’s death, punishes the women who rejected Orpheus and turns them, like Daphne, into trees. Orpheus himself, meanwhile, rejoins Eurydice in the Underworld where he can, the poet assures us, look back without loss: in this world, Ovid seems to imply, betrayal is a universal condition—only sorrow lasts. But in the same sort of consolation that Virgil held out for the Roman hero Aeneas, only in the afterlife, at last, can pious poets sing their songs forever. The Apotheosis of Caesar Despite (or rather, as a result of) all the changes he describes, the spirit of Rome, in Ovid’s work, emerges triumphant, and the Metamorphoses ends with “The Deifica- tion of Caesar” (Book 15) and his transformation from mortal to star to preside henceforth over the divine destiny of Rome. This section of the work, tracing Roman history from the fall of Troy to Ovid’s own time, is fairly serious in tone, its occasional comic touches muted. For all the problems of the Augustan Age, Ovid did not con- fuse the present actors with the script or reject its larger vision. In one last, subtle irony, Ovid implies in the “Epilogue” (Book 15) that his own fame will be carried above the stars—that is, above Caesar’s! Nevertheless, Ovid is aware of how dependent even the most critical poet is on the stability of the society in which his poems can be transmitted. Like Shakespeare’s magician Prospero in The"},{"pageNumber":982,"pageContent":"946 The World of Roman Myth Tempest, Ovid has woven an “insubstantial pageant” of shapes that shift before our eyes. And however much he might criticize Roman government, it is only when Rome is at last stabilized that the poet can be confident that the work which sum- mons those airy shapes into our presence will endure beyond the reach of Time. Only then, when the history of Rome becomes its own glorious monument, can the om- nipresent threat of perpetual change—the fear that, should Roman vigilance ever slip, the world would revert to the chaos from which it came—at last cease. Fortunately for modern readers, although Rome fell, Ovid, despite his fears, en- dured to become not only one of our most important sources of information about Greek mythology but also one of the most important influences on Western culture (see Chapter 21)."},{"pageNumber":983,"pageContent":"Excerpts from the METAMORPHOSES' Ovid BOOK 1 My intention is to tell of bodies changed To different forms; the gods, who made the changes, Will help me—or I hope so—with a poem That runs from the world’s beginning to our own days.

Tiresias answered: “Yes, if he never knows himself” How silly Those words seemed, for how long! But as it happened. Time proved them true—the way he died, the strangeness Of his infatuation. Now Narcissus Was sixteen years of age, and could be taken Either for boy or man; and boys and girls Both sought his love, but in that slender stripling Was pride so fierce no boy, no girl, could touch him. He was out hunting one day, driving deer Into the nets, when a nymph named Echo saw him, A nymph whose way of talking was peculiar In that she could not start a conversation Nor fail to answer other people talking. Up to this time Echo still had a body. She was not merely voice. She liked to chatter. But had no power of speech except the power To answer in the words she last had heard. Juno had done this: when she went out looking for Jove on top of some nymph among the mountains. Echo would stall the goddess off by talking Until the nymphs had fled. Sooner or later Juno discovered this and said to Echo: “The tongue that made a fool of me will shortly Have shorter use, the voice be brief hereafter.” Those were not idle words; now Echo always Says the last thing she hears, and nothing further. She saw Narcissus roaming through the country. Saw him, and burned, and followed him in secret. Burning the more she followed, as when sulphur Smeared on the rim of torches, catches fire When other fire comes near it. Oh, how often She wanted to come near with coaxing speeches. Make soft entreaties to him! But her nature Sternly forbids; the one thing not forbidden Is to make answers. She is more than ready For words she can give back. By chance Narcissus Lost track of his companions, started calling “Is anybody here?” and “Here! said Echo. He looked around in wonderment, called louder “Come to me!” “Come to me!” came back the answer. He looked behind him, and saw no one coming; “Why do you run from me?” and heard his question Repeated in the woods. “Let us get together!

During some periods of history, certain mythic figures (such as Icarus during the Renaissance or Prometheus during the Romantic period) have become symbols of the central ideas or concerns of the age. The Decline and Revival of Classical Mythology Perhaps the most remarkable attribute of classical mythology is its persistence. Long after ceasing to have even the remotest connections to belief systems, these myths have continued to resonate, reflecting continuing human concerns and providing an enduring cultural resource shared across the boundaries created by politics, language, religion, and time itself Classical mythology has not, of course, retained a constant level of popular appeal. In fact, its survival has not been at all a foregone conclusion. During the period following the collapse of the Roman Empire in the West, the rise and spread of Christianity and a long period of economic and political disorder in Europe contrib- uted to the general disappearance of literacy, as well as to a radical change in perspec- tive. Among the effects was a loss of knowledge of or interest in classical learning of all kinds. Although it never entirely disappeared, classical mythology was considered particularly inappropriate for a Christian audience, primarily because of its “pagan” deities. Further, the new guide for human behavior—the imitation of Christ, with its focus on humility and otherworldliness—theoretically negated the mythic hero as an appropriate role model (though that concept, too, survived by being transposed into an acceptably Christian context in such heroes as Roland and the ostensibly Christian Beowulf). 981"},{"pageNumber":1018,"pageContent":"982 The Western World’s Transformations of Myth As literacy gradually became more widespread again in the late Middle Ages, it was in the works of writers like Virgil and Ovid that growing numbers of readers rediscovered classical mythology and quickly proceeded to reclaim large territories of the mythological landscape, despite its pagan character. The example of Virgil, in fact, eased the process of assimilating the mythic material into the Christian world- view. In the fourth of a series of poems called the Eclogues, Virgil had referred to a child who would come to redeem Rome. Claiming this allusion as Virgil’s “predic- tion” of the Coming of Christ allowed medieval Christian readers to justify their attention to a pagan poet. In his three-part poem the Commedia (later known as the Divine Comedy), the Italian poet Dante expanded the trip to the Underworld from Book 6 of Virgil’s Aeneid into the subject of the entire first book (the Inferno) of his poem, transforming Aeneas’s voyage into a spiritual journey of the soul. He also made Virgil himself into a literary character, portraying the Roman poet as his guide through both Hell and Purgatory. While Dante placed the pagan Ulysses [oo-LIS- seez] (Odysseus) in Hell for daring to sail beyond the world’s limits to Mount Pur- gatory, he also borrowed many mythological details of Virgil’s Underworld, from the River Styx to figures such as Charon, Cerberus, and Minos. Virgil’s Aeneid re- mained, through the eighteenth century and beyond, the staple of European educa- tion, providing an introduction to the larger body of classical mythology that artists, composers, and writers could draw on for centuries to come. Meanwhile, the Courtly Love tradition, beginning in the twelfth century, sparked a revived interest in Ovid’s Art of Love. Ovid’s metaphor of service to Eros—or Cupid, the god of love whose flames, darts, and arrows wounded lovers—pervades love poems from Dante’s own love sonnets. La Vita Nuova (The New Life), to Petrarch’s cycle of sonnets To Laura, which, in turn, became the model for secular love poems from the early Renaissance to the present day, providing another vehicle by which the heritage of Greek and Roman mythology could be transmitted to the modern world. The Later Uses of Classical Mythology The popular uses of images from classical mythology in the modern world include fields as diverse as psychology, sociology, television, and advertising, to name a few. Indeed, mythic materials are so common that we are often scarcely aware of the mythic components of advertisements, such as the logos of tire companies (Atlas, the Titan who held the sky on his shoulders) or of floral delivery services (Hermes with winged sandals) or the “cupids” whose hearts and arrows adorn Valentine’s Day cards. There are mythological references even in apparently abstract phrases like “the cul- ture of narcissism” (a description of an era when people seem obsessed with gratifi- cation of their personal needs), which alludes to the myth of Narcissus, the young man who fell in love with his own image. Methods of Transmission Even if we focus solely on literature and the arts, a complete list of works that incor- porate elements of classical mythology would require hundreds of pages. But despite"},{"pageNumber":1019,"pageContent":"The Persistence of Myth 983 this scope and diversity, mythic material is most frequently transmitted in four basic ways: (1) rendering ancient plays or poems accessible to modern readers by translat- ing them into modern languages or by reviving them in contemporary performances; (2) updating (by reinterpreting or adapting) ancient stories, plays, or poems to make them relevant to contemporary audiences; (3) taking advantage of an audience’s fa- miliarity with mythic materials by borrowing their themes and images to create a double vision, ancient and modern, either to reinforce or to contrast each other in thematic counterpoint; or (4) using a specific mythic figure as an emblem or a symbol of an idea that an artist, writer, composer, or director wishes to expound or explore. Translations and Revivals In ancient Greece itself, of course, as in Rome (as long as educated Romans learned Greek), translations weren’t necessary. But by the Middle Ages, the vernacular Euro- pean languages had replaced Latin as the language of everyday speech, though Latin was retained as a religious and literary language; meanwhile, the study of Greek dwindled. When interest in classical writers was revived in the Renaissance, the study of Greek once again became popular with humanist scholars, who set about searching for Greek and Roman manuscripts. Even before the fall of Gonstantinople to the Turks in 1453, many Greek scholars had migrated to Italy, often bringing their prized ancient manuscripts with them and thus fueling the ongoing classical revival. As learning and the taste for classical works spread beyond the elite circles of humanist scholars, translations became necessary. One influential Renaissance translator was the English poet and playwright George Chapman, who was the first to translate Homer’s work into English (1616). Later, Alexander Pope did his own translation, rendering the Iliad in rhymed couplets, reflecting the eighteenth-century percep- tion of a harmonious and meticulously organized universe in which common sense reigned: The King of men, on public counsels bent, Convened the princes in his ample tent; Each seized a portion of the kingly feast. But stayed his hand when thirst and hunger ceased. Then Nestor spoke, for wisdom long approved, And, slowly rising, thus the council moved: '‘Monarch of nations! whose superior sway Assembled states and lords of earth obey. The laws and sceptres to thy hand are given, And millions own the care of thee and heaven. Thee, prince! it fits alike to speak and hear. Pronounce with judgment, with regard give ear. To see no wholesome motion be withstood. And ratify the best for public good. (9.121-135) Each era since has produced its own crop of translations, each reflective of its own taste. As scholars learned more about the ancient world and its languages, both the accuracy and the readability of the texts improved, and many fine modern transla- tions became widely available."},{"pageNumber":1020,"pageContent":"984 The Western World’s Transformations of Myth Adaptations, Revisions, and “Updatings” The practice of writing “revisionist” versions of extant works began as early as the era of the classical playwrights themselves: Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides wrote plays dramatizing their versions of the same myths as did their fellow playwrights and competitors. Each of the three, for instance, had his own version of the story of the revenge of Orestes and Electra. And although the basic plot outlines remained un- changed, their interpretations and judgments of the action differed radically. For ex- ample, whereas Aeschylus’s Oresteian trilogy praises the Athenian jury system as su- perior to a system of justice administered either by individual humans or by gods who have agendas of their own, Euripides’ Electra comments on the ability of impor- tant, well-connected people like Orestes and Electra to get off lightly even after com- mitting the most appalling crimes while peasants and villagers, who are portrayed as comparatively noble and generous, go unrewarded. Ovid, too, rewrote Greek myths in terms that reflected the sensibilities of his Roman audience, as did the Roman playwright Seneca. The Revival of Drama When, after a prolonged interruption during the Dark and Middle Ages, classical drama was revived in the Renaissance, playwrights began im- mediately revising dramas to fit their own conceptions. Some of the earliest plays, such as Hercules Furens (1561), were composed and performed in London at the Inns of Court by university students who showed great fondness for the plays of the Roman playwright Seneca, as did William Shakespeare {Titus Andronicus, 1594). Later examples include the grand Baroque moral tragedies of the seventeenth-century French playwright Jean Racine {Phaedre, 1677, dead Andromache, 1667, for example) and the twentieth-century rewrites of the American playwright Eugene O’Neill (for example, his trilogy Mourning Becomes Electra, 1931, a version of Aeschylus’s Ores- teid). And the French existentialist dramatists Andre Gide {Oedipus, 1931), Jean Giraudoux {Electra, 1937), Jean-Paul Sartre {The Flies, 1943, also a version of the Orestes myth), and Jean Anouilh collectively formed a kind of mini-industry of mythological dramas. Anouilh, for example, wrote a version of Antigone (1944) that would have been especially meaningful to a French audience during World War II. In Sophocles’ ver- sion, the heroine’s determination to bury her brother’s body in defiance of the law decreed by her uncle Creon is portrayed as a courageous upholding of the gods’ moral law in the face of the decrees of a tyrant; in Anouilh’s hands, her defiant self-sacrifice is re-created as an example of an existential act of commitment—of asserting one’s freedom to define oneself morally in a universe whose absurdity is underlined by the author’s portrayal of Greon and his henchmen as members of the Vichy government (French collaborators with the Nazis who were at that time occupying France). Musical and Literary Adaptations Nor are the adaptations confined to plays. In fact, the invention of opera itself may be traced to a desire to revive Greek drama in its “original” form. The Florentine Gamarata, a group of Italian humanists devoted to literature and the arts, believed that the Greeks and Romans sang rather than spoke their tragedies in stage performance. They were determined to revive the ancient practice, which they believed to be a perfect marriage of poetry and music. To ful-"},{"pageNumber":1021,"pageContent":"The Persistence of Myth 985 fill that aim, Ottavio Rinuccini, a court poet of the Medici family, wrote Daphne (c. 1594), a text based on Greek myth set to music, which is generally taken to be the first opera in European history Its music has been lost, and thus Rinuccini’s second such work, Eurydice (1600), also based on a Greek myth, is considered the first complete opera. It is the Baroque composer Glaudio Monteverdi, however, who is credited with creating modern opera as we know it, unifying all the vocal, instrumental, and dra- matic elements. When he wrote his first opera {Orpheus, 1607), he, too, turned to Greek mythology and, like Rinuccini, chose to retell the story of Orpheus and Eu- lydice. Many opera composers since—from Henry Purcell {Dido and Aeneas, 1689), to Richard Strauss {Electra, 1909), to Igor Stravinsky {Oedipus Rex, 1927)—have continued to use adaptations of works based on classical myths as the sources of their libretti. Further continuing the tradition of adaptation of mythology were poets such as William Shakespeare (“Venus and Adonis,” 1593) and writers of fiction such as John Barth (whose Chimera, 1972, tells the stories of three heroes including Perseus and Bellerophon) and James Joyce (whose novel Ulysses, 1914, updates the Odyssey, setting it in early-twentieth-century Dublin). More recently, the Caribbean poet Derek Walcott also dramatized the Homeric epic in The Odyssey: A Stage Version (1992). The Odyssey, in fact, has had continuing appeal as the basis for revisions of myths, including some with a feminist perspective. Charles Frazier’s novel Cold Mountain (1998), which sets the story of Odysseus and Penelope in the Blue Ridge Mountains during the Civil War, gives more attention to Ada (the Penelope charac- ter) than do traditional reworkings of the myth, while Indian-American novelist Bharati Mukherjee’s jasmine (1989), set in India, New York, and Iowa, portrays the heroine herself as the Odysseus character. The Use of Mythic Themes and Images Even more frequently than adapting entire myths, plays, or epics, countless artists, writers, and composers have based their work more loosely on mythic themes or have employed mythic images, whether for a brief allusion made in a single line of poetry or prose, for the inspiration of the spirit of a musical composition, or for a concrete embodiment of a feeling or idea or point of view in a novel, poem, painting, film, or even photograph or dance (Figure 21-1). Thus, to cite a mere handful of examples, the Renaissance painter Sandro Bot- ticelli depicted the birth of Venus (see Color Plate 1), revealing the grace, beauty, and harmonious nature of Fove; half a century later, in the Mannerist style, Jean Cousin the Elder placed Eve, the “first Pandora” (see Color Plate 2), in the traditional pose of the reclining Venus, depicting her with one hand on her jar and the other resting on a skull, suggesting a more ambivalent response. The painter Claude Eorrain re- created a scene from the Aeneid (Figure 21-2)—a vision of a “Golden Age” that reflected the order, balance, and symmetry of neoclassical ideals. Many of Forrain’s paintings depicted similar scenes, and portrayals of the Golden Age remained popular throughout the period. The Victorian poet Alfred, Ford Tennyson (“Ulysses,” 1842) picked up where Homer left off, imagining the frustrations of an aged and enervated Odysseus longing for the thrill of one last voyage.

Without her you wouldn’t have set out. She hasn’t anything else to give. Similarly, in the early twentieth century, the poet William Butler Yeats (“Leda and the Swan, 1923) used the myth of the conception of Fdelen of Troy to consider the irony of seemingly transient moments causing enormously destructive consequences. But, the modern surrealist painter Salvador Dali rendered the same myth m a much more cerebral and nonthreatening fashion (Figure 21-3). YG FJ. Auden ( The Shield of Achilles, 1952) rewrote Fdomer’s description of the two sides of Achilles’ shield, with its contrasting scenes of peace and war, in the Iliad to comment on the illusions of heroism and the stupidity of power enforced by violence. A similar use of mythic images can be found in the work of Pablo Picasso, who did a series of etchings illustrating Ovid s Metamorphoses. The images he em- ployed in the Minotauromachy (Figure 21-4) reappeared two years later in Guernica (Figure 21-5), a stark black-and-white painting depicting the horrors of the Spanish Civil War.

In this pastoral scene in Lorrain’s painting, which anticipates the neoclassical style, the landscape has become the real subject, a peaceful, bucolic scene tastefully dotted with small structures in imitation of Greek architecture to lend a “classical” flavor. The human figures who occupied most of the space in paintings from the Renaissance through the middle of the seventeenth century have been reduced to the point that they are absorbed into the landscape and are almost inciden- tal—a fitting reflection of an age that saw itself as made up of “pygmies” whose achieve- ments could never surpass those of the “giants,” such as Idomer and Virgil, of ancient Greece and Rome.

Picasso, who at the time of this paint- ing had recently done a series of etchings illustrating Ovid’s Metamorphoses, often turned to classical themes. The figure of the Minotaur reappears frequently in his paintings and etch- ings. In this etching, “The Battle of the Minotaur,” the half-human beast creates terror and chaos. Amid the carnage, he points the sword toward a little girl holding a candle and a bou- quet of flowers—a peace offering? Has she, like Ariadne, let Theseus (the man on the lad- der?) into the labyrinth, naively trusting that he would destroy the monster within with no consequences?

Extended Uses of Mythic Themes Some examples of more extended uses of mythic themes and images are such diverse works as John Updike’s novel The Centaur {X'hGX), in which the divided creature of myth is identified with the conflicting impulses and needs of a Pennsylvania high school student, and James Joyce’s Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916), whose hero, a young poet, is compared with Daedalus, King Mi- nos’s “artificer” who designed both the Labyrinth at Knossos (the institution of the Catholic Church in Joyce’s version) and the waxen wings (now equated with the powers of poetry) with which to escape its confines. Bernard Malamud’s novel The Natural (1952)—like the film based on it (1984, directed by Barry Levinson)—has a baseball player hero who undergoes experiences similar to those of both Achilles and Odysseus and who even has a bat hand-carved from a hickory tree (reminiscent of Achilles’ “Pe- lian ash”), with Zeus’s own symbol, the lightning bolt, emblazoned on it."},{"pageNumber":1025,"pageContent":"The Persistence of Myth 989 FIGURE 21-5 Pablo Picasso, Guernica, 1937. In this enormous painting (1U6^^ X 25^8^^), Picasso uses many of the images from the Minotauromachy (see Figure 21-4)—the disjointed bodies, the scream of the horse, the girl holding the lamp, and even the bull—to depict the horrors of the saturation-bombing of the town of Guernica by Franco’s forces during the Spanish Civil War. In this painting, however, no one, not even the bull, escapes the agony, and the flowers lie trampled near the now-broken blade. The artist’s exclusion of color and combining of cubist and expressionist techniques—the avoidance of three-dimensional forms, the suggestion of “collage” in the newsprint-like sections of the horse’s body, the dis- tortion of eyes that reveal inner and outer perspectives simultaneously—allow him to depict raw, unmediated emotions. Instead of the conventional view through the frame of a “win- dow” that gives viewers a glimpse of events happening to others, this painting is a nightmare that envelops viewers and traps them inside the horror, re-creating the experience of the origi- nal victims: the only rational response to this painting is a scream. (Prado, Madrid) In these and other works based on mythic themes or images, the mythic material provides a way of understanding in greater depth the individual experiences depicted. These authors take advantage of the continuing relevance of the myths to the un- changing conditions of human experience while using the same myths to comment, sometimes ironically, on the experiences they describe. Myth as Emblem Some writers, in the sciences and social sciences as well as the arts, have seized on a specific mythic figure to function as an emblem or a symbol of an idea they wished to explain. Thus, the psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud used the figure of Oedipus to embody the unconscious, infantile erotic drives to which, he argued, all humans are subject {The Interpretation of Dreams, 1900). And Albert Camus, an existentialist writer, chose Sisyphus (who was condemned to push an enormous stone repeatedly up a mountain, only to have it roll down the other side) as a concrete embodiment of the choice an individual makes to define himself in an absurd world in that mo- ment when he decides, each time, to push the stone up the mountain once more {The Myth of Sisyphus, 1942). Similarly, contemporary ecologists have singled out the figure of Gaea, the ancient earth goddess, to signify the essential interrelationship of all components of earth s biosphere. And feminist psychologists employ the same goddess—both in her own right and as divided into separate functions in such"},{"pageNumber":1026,"pageContent":"990 The Western World's Transformations of Myth goddesses as Hera, Athene, Artemis, and Aphrodite—as emblems of various com- ponents of the female psyche (Jean Shinoda Bolen, Goddesses in Everywoman, 1984). More recently, John Gray {Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus, 1992) uses the mythic lovers in his title as emblems of the problems of communication between the genders in modern relationships. John Shay {Achilles in Vietnam: Combat Trauma and the Undoing of Character, 1994), a psychiatrist treating Vietnam War veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorders, uses Homer’s Achilles to illuminate the afflictions of modern combat veterans while using the modern soldiers’ experience to clarify what also happens to Achilles: the sense of betrayal, the withdrawal from one’s society, and the “berserk state” that is the climax of extreme combat trauma, appar- ently, whether in ancient battles or in those of our own era. Myth and Cultural History Precisely because they have lasted so long, myths, in whatever form they have been transmitted, can be extremely useful tools for students of cultural history. For ex- ample, because so many myths continue to be adapted and reinterpreted, historians can study the various revisions as barometers of cultural change. Thus, the story of the musician Orpheus and his ill-fated descent into the Underworld to rescue his beloved Eurydice can be variously portrayed as a grand but tragic passion, or as a descent into the depths of the human psyche or into the abyss of existential despair, or even as a comment on the destructive effect of patriarchal male-female relation- ships. H. D. (Hilda Doolittle) takes this latter approach, lamenting in her poem “Eurydice” the “arrogance” and self-sufhciency of Orpheus, who can neither leave Eurydice at peace in the Underworld nor allow her to emerge on her own terms (1917, 1925). Indeed, the story of Orpheus and Eurydice has been interpreted in these and many other ways in such works as the operas of Monteverdi {Orpheus, 1607), Christoph Willibald Gluck {Orpheus and Eurydice, 1762), and Franz Joseph Haydn {Orpheus and Eurydice, 1791) and a play by Anouilh {Eurydice, 1941), among many others. The story has likewise been retold in film, such as Orpheus (1949, directed by Jean Cocteau) and The Eugitive Kind (1960, directed by Sidney Lumet), itself a version of Tennessee Williams’s 1957 play Orpheus Descending. In the Brazilian film Black Or- pheus (1958, directed by Marcel Camus), the Underworld is the Brazilian Carnival when, with normal constraints and inhibitions lifted, the demonic forces of violence and unreason are unleashed. More recently, in The Hip-Hop Waltz of Etirydice by Iranian-born playwright Reza Abdoh (an example of performance art staged at the Los Angeles Theatre Center in 1991), the Underworld is portrayed as one segment of the contemporary gay-lesbian subculture, complete with punk costumes and gen- der reversal (Orpheus is played by a woman, Eurydice by a man)—a nightmare vision of a world living under the threat of AIDS, in which Hades is a fascist police captain and Orpheus goes to hell on a motorcycle. In the fine arts, similar series of transformations can be traced. For example, in two seventeenth-century paintings done only eighteen years apart, two artists—Peter Paul Rubens and Nicolas Poussin—depicted the same event, the rape of the Sabine women (Figures 21-6 and 21-7).

In Rubens’s intensely Ba- roque work, the human figures are in the foreground and occupy most of the large canvas fJ'T' X 6' 10\"). The figures are approximately life-size, and the foreshortening of perspective puts the viewer right into the scene, intensifying the dramatic effects and getting the viewer personally involved. The writhing bodies of the victims and the twisted configurations of horses and men form intersecting spirals that create a vortex of movement in the center of the painting. But while the viewer instinctively sympathizes with the victims, the latter are never- theless portrayed in such sensuous fashion that the painting augments the same erotic appeal the rapists are responding to. Forced in this way to assume the perspectives of both victim and rapist, the viewer is implicated in the very act he or she must deplore.

In contrast to Ru- bens’s painting (see Figure 21-6), there are no ambiguities in Poussin’s version of the same event, which clearly moves toward the neoclassical mode. Though there are far more figures in this almost equally large painting (5' T^ X 6' 10\")> they are less threatening to the viewer. Smaller in scale relative to the size of the canvas and further diminished by the backdrop of buildings and sky, they are also organized into a clear, controlling pattern—a classical equi- lateral triangle with its apex in the light behind the upraised hand of the woman in the cen- ter. The Roman attackers are portrayed as heroic in appearance, in contrast to Rubens’s twisted bodies juxtaposed against the horses, whose animal natures the rapists seem to be act- ing out. The event has also been moved from the countryside to an urban setting so that the stable forms of classical buildings and columns (looking, indeed, as if the Romans had already built their city there) help enclose and contain the violence. The women here are clothed so that a sense of decorum is maintained even in the midst of the abduction. Finally, the figure of Romulus, mythical founder of Rome, on the podium of the temple (and thus presumably acting with the approval of the gods), appears to be directing the action, emphasizing the sense that everything is under control. (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) almost see the shift from Baroque to neoclassical sensibility occur. Rubens’s foreshort- ened, intensely violent painting, with its naked, contorted bodies and writhing mo- tion, places the viewer menacingly close, almost within the scene itself. In Poussin’s painting, by contrast, the women are more decorously clothed, and the entire action is confined within the triangle whose apex is pointed to by the hand of the woman just left of center and the sword of the man standing to the right of center. Poussin moves the point of view discreetly back, presenting a more detached, more con- trolled, even heroic spectacle, all taking place under the watchful eye of the Roman soldier on the pedestal. Not only can paintings reinterpret myths, but those paintings themselves can be used as sources for further commentary. Consider the way in which Jean-Auguste- Dominique Ingres’s painting the Apotheosis of Homer (Figure 21-8) is dismantled and commented on ironically in Dali’s painting of the same name (Figure 21-9)."},{"pageNumber":1029,"pageContent":"The Persistence of Myth 993 FIGURE 21-8 Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Apotheosis of Homer, 1827. In Ingres’s trib- ute to the Greek poet, shown in this painting receiving from the winged hgure of Victory the laurel crown as Prince of Poets and being welcomed into the company of the divine, we see, in effect, the “apotheosis” of neoclassical painting at its most extreme—an idealized and es- sentially fixed, static world realistically portrayed with great precision. The triangle made of actual portraits of artists and writers through the ages and forming an apex at the crown is visually repeated in the two figures personifying the Iliad (left) and the Odyssey (right) seated on the steps beneath their “father.” A third triangle is formed by the entablature of the temple behind. This painting also literally enshrines the neoclassical belief that writers and artists, however “great” they may be in their own time, can at best imitate and pay tribute to, but can never hope to equal or surpass, the “giants” of the past.

In this surrealist version, Dali lit- erally deconstructs Ingres’s painting (see Figure 21-8) and with it the illusions of an “eternal” art whose rules and value are unchanging. Dali reduces “Homer” to a broken bit of statuary, a relic, while the solid temple of the Muse itself melts.

In stark contrast, the Mannerist interpretations of Titian reveal the goddess in more blatantly sensuous fashion, while showing her from more than one perspective. Fiis reclining Venus of Urbino (see Figure 21-11) watches the viewer watching her, while his Venus with the Mirror (see Figure 21-12) multiplies perspectives still further by having the view- ers watch Venus while she watches us in a mirror. Finally, Salvador Dali s surrealist sculpture, Venus de Milo of the Drawers (see Figure 21-19), parodies the original, reminding us through his hollow plaster figure that “Venus” is an abstract concept into which we must insert, like socks in a drawer, whatever meaning we choose. Vlyth ds Cultural Icon Sometimes a whole generation will latch onto a particular mythic figure who will then become a kind of cultural icon to which everyone seems to pay tribute. Notable examples of such occurrences include Icarus in the Renaissance and Prometheus in the Romantic period. The Renaissance During the Renaissance (a word first used by the Italian poet Petrarch to describe the rebirth of the cultural achievements of Greece and Rome), the writings of Fiomer, as well as those of Ovid, Plutarch, and the Roman playwright Seneca, joined those of Virgil and many others already popularized in the late medieval period as mythology shared in the general classical revival. The earlier rejection of pagan ideas yielded to the desire of the Christian humanists to unify their religious beliefs with their secular aesthetic and intellectual interests. Thus, “service to the god of love,” Eros, is a phrase Renaissance writers often used without the slightest awareness of implicit blasphemy, as in John Lyly s lyric from Alexander and Campaspe. Alternatively, the poet may have confessed awareness of the contradiction, but he played on the pun, referring to both Christ and Cupid as “god of love,” as did John Donne in “Love’s Deity.” When forced to choose, the Renaissance poet may have even opted for Cupid: for example, in Sir Philip Sidney’s sonnet from the series Astrophel and Stella, the poet deals with the conflict between Ovidian images and Christian beliefs, between the compelling impulses of the heart toward erotic love and the theoretical journey of the soul toward heaven. Maintaining that precarious balance so typical of the paradoxical stance that Renaissance scholars termed Christian humanism, Sidney manages to have it both ways, confessing that, although Cupid’s darts may be dismissed as mere poetic artifice, the erotic drive overwhelms any purely theoretical intention as surely as if there were a god called Cupid who takes unerring aim at human hearts."},{"pageNumber":1031,"pageContent":"The Persistence of Myth 995 FIGURE 21-10 A^phrodite of Melos (Venus de Milo), c. 200 - 150 B.c.

Breaking the one-way mirror that usually al- lows us to see into a painting, while not being seen ourselves, Titian shatters the barrier that normally separates the “real” world of the viewer from the “unreal” world of “art” and makes the viewer conscious of having been caught intruding on Venus’s privacy.

(Private collection) During the Renaissance, biblical figures such as David (in Michelangelo’s sculp- ture, Figure 21-20) and Adam and Eve (in his painting on the Sistine Chapel ceiling) are portrayed as Greek gods, whereas mythological stories (as in Lucas Cranach the Elder’s Judgment of Paris, Figure 21-21) are depicted in Renaissance costumes and settings. Throughout Europe, artists began to go out of their way to invoke the Muses and re-create the Graces of an earlier age. Mythological themes abounded in the paintings, inspired the music, adorned the architecture, and filled the pages of the poems, plays, and stories, providing everything from brief allusions to complete plots. Further, a renewed enthusiasm for the heroic model of experience is evident in Ben- venuto Cellini’s sculpture Perseus and Medusa (Figure 21-22). Icarus Amid the cornucopia of mythological subjects, one figure seems best to express the fears and aspirations of the time — I carus, the boy who flew too high. For the Greeks, the myth of Icarus was a lesson in the necessity of the Golden Mean of moderation and self-control. The Renaissance Icarus, however, came to be admired for having the audacity to break through the limits of convention and ordinary experience—a tragic figure whose fall into the sea is the price he pays for a glimpse of a higher vision, for a moment of transcendence at the peak of a brief but glorious trajectory.

Faustus, for example, sells his soul to the devil (or his servant Mephistophilis) in return for forbidden knowledge, recapitulating the humanistic defiance earlier cap- tured in the myths of Prometheus, Pandora, and Eve. Perceived as a threat to orthodoxy, Icarus must certainly fall: His waxen wings did mount above his reach And melting heavens conspired his overthrow.

Thus, Pieter Breughel the Elder, in his painting The Fall of Icarus (see Color Plate 12), moves the figure of Icarus from center stage to an insignificant—and almost indistinguishable—spot in a corner of the painting: only the legs, jutting out of the sea, reveal the drowning boy, while the rest of the world, indifferent, goes about its business. In this painting, Breughel sig- nals a shift in values (which occurred somewhat earlier on the Continent than in more remote places like England); instead of the obsessively human-centered world of the Renaissance, we here assume the asymmetrical Baroque perspective of a world adrift in an infinite universe in which individuals have no intrinsic significance and the nobility essential for heroic tragedy is impossible or irrelevant. The Romantic Age: Prometheus In the Romantic period, it was Prometheus who seems to have leaped out of the annals of mythology into the consciousness of an entire generation. Identified with the creative energy, the heroic rebellion against oppressive authority, and the sense of being reborn into a new age unleashed by the Erench Revolution, Prometheus cap- tured the imagination of artists, composers, poets, and novelists alike in works as diverse as Lord Byron’s poem “Prometheus” (1801) and Percy Bysshe Shelley’s Pro- metheus Unbound (1818), a lyric drama offered in answer to Aeschylus’s Prometheus Bound. In the preface to his play, Shelley speaks for his contemporaries as he explains, I was averse from a catastrophe so feeble as that of reconciling the Champion with the Oppressor of mankind [the presumed ending of Aeschylus’s trilogy]. The moral interest of the fable, which is so powerfully sustained by the sufferings and endurance of Prometheus, would be annihilated if we could conceive him as unsaying his high language and quailing before his . . . perfidious adversary [Zeus]. Shelley goes on to compare Prometheus to Satan (as depicted in John Milton’s Chris- tian epic Paradise Lost, 1674), who also defied divine authority. But Shelley finds Prometheus preferable because, in addition to courage, and majesty, and firm and patient opposition to omnipotent force, he is susceptible of being described as exempt from the taints of ambition, envy, revenge, and a desire for personal aggrandisement. . . . Prometheus, Shelley concludes, is the “type of the highest perfection of moral and intellectual nature, impelled by the purest and truest motives to the best and noblest ends.” In the last speech of the play, Demagorgon celebrates the Titan’s triumph over tyranny: This is the day, which down the void abysm At the Earth-born’s spell yawns for Heaven’s despotism.

(4.554-578) Prometheus and Napoleon The myth created an aura around historical events and powerful personalities as well. Napoleon, for example, who rather enjoyed having himself portrayed as a Greek god (Figure 21-23), was imaginatively linked with Pro- metheus until he “betrayed” the Revolution by declaring himself emperor. Beetho- vens Third Symphony (the Eroica, 1804), for example, which incorporates musical material from his earlier composition The Creatures of Prometheus, was originally dedicated to Napoleon, but Beethoven angrily removed the dedication in response to that betrayal. Napoleon thus revealed exactly those traits that Shelley had identified with Satan. The exhilarating spirit of freedom, released from all restraints, can also be a source of terror. Prometheus and Satan The convergence of the redemptive and the demonic in Shelleys juxtaposition of Prometheus and Satan was not coincidental. The image of Satan-as-hero prompted a revival of interest in the poetry of Milton, whose Paradise Lost, itself based on classical models, had portrayed the Archenemy in terms that the Romantics found intensely appealing: the poet William Blake even asserted that Mil- ton was “of the Devil s party without knowing it.” In a similar juxtaposition, Percy Bysshe Shelleys wife, Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, titled her novel Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus (1818). Her protagonist, defying conventional moral limits in order to release the human spirit from “lifeless clay” into a more sublime state, comments on his intention to “explore unknown powers” and to reveal the secrets of creation: Life and death appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and pour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new species would bless me as its creator and source. . . . What this ‘\"god” creates, however, turns out to be monstrous. During the Renaissance, such pursuit of forbidden knowledge was identified with Faustus, who was, in turn, compared with Icarus, the daring boy. Then, after a long hiatus during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when acts of individual tran- scendence were not sought after or admired, Faustus himself was revived in the Ro- mantic period, as in the German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s version {Faust, Part 1, 1801).

How is his portrayal in the Inferno different from Homer’s portrayal in the Odysseys' Where does Dante’s Ulysses sail to on his last voyage? Why is he punished for it? How does Dante’s version of Ulysses’s last voyage differ from Tennyson’s? 2. (a) Explain Yeats’s interpretation of the tragedy of Troy in his poem “Leda and the Swan.” (b) Contrast Yeats’s poem with Dali’s painting Leda Atomica (see Figure 21-3). Explain Leda’s role in bringing about the war in the painting and in the poem, and compare it with Zeus’s role. Why is Zeus not named in the poem or pictured in the painting? 3. Compare W H. Auden’s “The Shield of Achilles” with Homer’s description of the shield in the Iliad. How do the differences reflect ancient versus modern beliefs or values? How does each portray war? 4. Compare Salvador Dali’s Venus de Milo of the Drawers (see Figure 21-19), with the original Venus de Milo (see Figure 21-10). What does Dali’s version suggest about the goddess of love? Why did the modern artist depict the figure with drawers? What does the sculpture suggest those drawers might contain? 5. (a) How does the Breughel painting The Fall of Icarus (Color Plate 12) comment on the Renaissance interpretation of Icarus as a tragic hero? (b) How does W. H. Au- den’s sonnet “Musee des Beaux Arts” comment on Breughel’s painting? Is Auden’s view more like the Renaissance view or more like Breughel’s? 6. In a detailed analysis of Rubens’s Rape of the Daughters of Leucippus and Poussin’s Rape of the Sabine Women (see Figures 21-6 and 21-7), explain how the two paintings present different interpretations of this event from Roman mythology. How do the choices of a close-up view versus greater distance, of few versus many figures, and of a country versus town setting affect the interpretation portrayed in each painting? 7. Choose two illustrations from the section “Versions of Venus” (see Figures 21-10 through 21-19), and compare and contrast the two artists’ views of the goddess. If possible, relate the differences to the times in which each artist lived. 8. Compare the figure of Prometheus in Byron’s poem either with that of Aeschylus’s Prometheus Bound or with the figure of Satan in the excerpt from Milton’s Paradise Lost. What political and moral values are associated with each figure? 9. Discuss the metaphor of Cupid, the “god of love,” in either Donne’s “Love’s Deity” or Lyly’s “Cupid and My Campaspe.” Compare the poem you have selected with Sidney’s sonnet from Astrophel and Stella. What attitude toward Cupid is present in each poem? How does each poet’s use of Cupid reflect his attitude toward the woman he loves? Where relevant, explain how the image of Cupid is related to the poet’s own religious beliefs. (The following questions require outside sources.) 10. R ead either Sophocles’ or Euripides’ version of Electra, and compare it to Aeschylus’s Oresteian trilogy.
