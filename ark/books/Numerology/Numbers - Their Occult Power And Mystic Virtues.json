It is only at the earnest request of these kindly critics that I have consented to publish this volume. The contents are necessarily of a fragmentary character, and have been collected from an immense number of sources; the original matter has been inten- tionally reduced to the least possible quantity, so as to obtain space for the inclusion of the utmost amount of ancient, quaint and occult learning. It is impossible to give even an approximate list of works which have been consulted; direct quotations have been acknowledged in numerous instances, and (perhaps naturally) many a statement might have been equally well quoted from the book of a contemporary author, a mediaeval monk, a Roman historian, a Greek poet, or a Hindu Adept. To give the credit to the modern author would not be fair to the ancient sage, to refer the reader to a Sanskrit tome would be in most cases only loss of time and waste of paper. My great difficulty has been to supply informa- tion mystic enough to match the ideal of the work, and yet not so esoteric as to convey truths which Adepts have still concealed. \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0002\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Nu m b e r s ---Th e ir O c cu lt Powe r An d Mys t ic Vir t u e s B y W.

Hebrew and Chaldee should of course be read from right to left, and it was at first intended so to print them in their converted form, but the appearance of Hebrew in English letters re- versed was too grotesque; ADNI is a representation of the Aleph, Daleth, Nun, Yod, of “Adonai,” but INDA would have been sheer barbarity. In the case of Hebrew words I have often added the pronunciation. 6. The “Secret Doctrine” of H. P. Blavatsky, a work of erudition containing a vast fund of archaic doctrine, has supplied me with valuable quotations. If any readers de- sire a deeper insight into the analogies between numbers and ideas, I refer them in addition to the works of Eliphas Levi, Athanasius Kircher, Godfrey Higgins, Mi- chael Maier and John Heydon. I have quoted from each of these authorities, and Thomas Taylor’s “Theoretic Arithmetic” has supplied me with a great part of the purely arithmetical notions of the Pythagoreans, the elu- cidation of which was mainly due to him.

I have added in this edition many notes on the notions of the Rabbis of Israel, both from those who contrib- uted to the Mishnah and Gemara of the Talmuds of Je- rusalem and of Babylon, and from the Rabbis who made a special study of the Kabalah. Only a few Talmudic treatises have as yet appeared in the English language, and hardly any Kabalistic tracts, except three from the Zohar or Book of Splendour, viz., the Siphra Dtzeni- outha, the Idra Rabba and the Idra Suta. Many Talmudic and Kabalistic quotations may, however, be found in J. P. Stehelin’s Rabbinical Literature of 1748; in John Al- len’s “ Modern Judaism,” of 1816, and in works on the Kabalah by Adolph Franck and Christian Ginsburg, while Hershon has published Hebraic lore in his “ Tal- mudic Miscellany,” and “ Genesis, According to the Talmud.” 8.

The fundamentals of the numerical Kabalistic ideas on creation are laid down in that trea- tise; it has also been printed both in French and Ger- man, and there is an American edition.

Very little is known of his early life, be- yond the fact that he won prizes for feats of agility at the Olympic Games. Having attained manhood and feeling dissatisfied with the amount of knowledge to be gained at home, he left his native land and spent many years in travel, visiting in turn most of the great centers of Learning. History nar- rates that his pilgrimage in search of wisdom extended to Egypt, Hindostan, Persia, Crete and Palestine, and that he gathered from each country fresh stores of in- formation, and succeeded in becoming well acquainted with the Esoteric Wisdom as well as with the popular exoteric knowledge of each. He returned with his mind well stored and his judgment matured, to his home, intending to open there a College of learning, but this he found to be impracticable owing to the opposition of its turbulent ruler Polycrates.

For nearly forty years he taught his pupils, and exhibited his wonderful powers; but an end was put to his institution, and he himself was forced to flee from the city, owing to a conspiracy and rebellion which arose on account of a quarrel between the people of Crotona and the inhabitants of Sybaris. He succeeded in reaching Metapontum, where he is said to have died about the year of 500 B.C. 12.

Photius of Constantinople has left a Bibliotheca of the ideas of the older philosophers. Coming down to more recent times, the following au- thors should be consulted: Meursius, Johannes, 1620; Meibomius, Marcus, 1650; and Kircher, Athanasius, 1660. They collected and epitomized all that was extant of previous authors concerning the doctrines of the Py- thagoreans. The first eminent follower of Pythagoras was Aristaeus, who married Theano, the widow of his master: next followed Mnesarchus, the son of Pythago- ras; and later Bulagoras, Tidas, and Diodorus the As- pendian. After the original school was dispersed, the chief instructors became Clinias and Philolaus at Heraclea; Theorides and Eurytus at Metapontum; and Archytas, the sage of Tarentum. The school of Pythagoras has several peculiar character- istics. Every new member was obliged to pass a period of five years of contemplation in perfect silence; the members held everything in common, and rejected ani- mal food; they were believers in the doctrine of metem- psychosis, and were inspired with an ardent and implicit faith in their founder and teacher. So much did the ele- ment of faith enter into their training, that “ autos epha” - “ He said it” – was to them complete proof. Intense fra- ternal affection between the pupils was also a marked feature of the school; hence their saying, “ my friend is my other self,” has become a byword to this day.

A considerable amount of uncertainty, therefore, is inseparable from any consideration of the real doctrines of Pythagoras himself, but we are on surer grounds when we investi- gate the opinions of his followers. It is recorded that his instruction to his followers was formulated into two great divisions----the sci- ence of numbers and the theory of magnitude. The former division included two branches, arith- metic and musical harmony; the latter was fur- ther subdivided into the consideration of magnitude at rest----geometry, and magnitude in motion---astronomy .

Wyn n We s t c ot t The most striking peculiarities of his doctrines are de- pendent on the mathematical conceptions, numerical ideas and impersonations upon which his philosophy was founded. The principles governing N umbers were supposed to be the principles of all Real Existences; and as N umbers are the primary constituents of Mathe- matical Quantities, and at the same time present many analogies to various realities, it was further inferred that the elements of N umbers were the elements of Realities. To Pythagoras himself it is believed that the natives of Europe owe the first teaching of the properties of N umbers, of the prin- ciples of music and of physics; but there is evidence that he had visited Central Asia, and there had ac- quired the mathematical ideas which form the basis of his doctrine. The modes of thought introduced by Pythagoras, and followed by his successor Jam- blicus and others, became known later on by the titles of the “Italian School,” or the “Doric School.” 15. The followers of Pythagoras delivered their knowledge to pupils, fitted by selection and by training to receive it, in secret; but to others by numerical and mathematical names and notions. Hence they called forms, numbers; a point, the monad; a line, the dyad; a superficies, the triad; and a solid, the tetrad. \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0002\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Nu m b e r s ---Th e ir O c cu lt Powe r An d Mys t ic Vir t u e s B y W.

The ODD number, when divided into two equal parts, leaves the monad in the middle between the parts. All even numbers also (except the dyad —two—which is simply two unities) may be divided into two equal parts, and also into two unequal parts, yet so that in neither division will either parity be mingled with imparity, nor imparity with parity. The binary number two cannot be divided into two unequal parts. Thus 10 divides into 5 and 5, equal parts, also into 3 and 7, both imparities, and into 6 and 4, both parities; and 8 divides into 4 and 4, equals and parities, and into 5 and 3, both imparities."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Nu m b e r s ---Th e ir O c cu lt Powe r An d Mys t ic Vir t u e s B y W. Wyn n We s t c ot t But the ODD number is only divisible into uneven parts, and one part is also a parity and the other part an imparity; thus 7 into 4 and 3, or 5 and 2, in both cases unequal, and odd and even. The ancients also remarked the monad to be “ odd,” and to be the first “ odd number,” because it cannot be di- vided into two equal numbers. Another reason they saw was that the monad, added to an even number, became an odd number, but if evens are added to evens the re- sult is an even number. 17. Aristotle, in his Pythagoric treatise, remarks that the monad partakes also of the nature of the even number, because when added to the odd it makes the even, and added to the even the odd is formed. Hence it is called “ evenly odd.” Archytas of Tarentum was of the same opinion. The Monad, then, is the first idea of the odd number; and so the Pythagoreans speak of the “ two” as the “ first idea of the indefinite dyad,” and attribute the number 2 to that which is indefinite, unknown, and inordinate in the world; just as they adapt the monad to all that is definite and orderly.

Unevenly even numbers may be parted into two equal divisions, and these parts again equally divided, but the process does not proceed until unity is reached; such numbers are 24 and 28. Odd numbers also are susceptible of being looked upon from three points of view, thus: “ First and incomposite” ; such are 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 19, 23, 29 and 31. No other number measures them but unity; they are not composed of other numbers, but are gener- ated from unity alone. “ Second and composite” are indeed “ odd,” but contain and are composed from other numbers; such are 9, 15, 21, 25, 27, 33 and 39.

The Third Variety of odd numbers is more complex and is of itself, second and composite, but with reference to another is first and incomposite; such are 9 and 25.

Odd numbers are sorted out into these three classes by a device called the “ Sieve of Eratosthenes,” which is of too complex a nature to form part of a monograph so discursive as this must be. Even numbers have also been divided by the ancient sages into Perfect, Deficient and Superabundant. Superperfect or Superabundant are such as 12 and 24. Deficient are such as 8 and 14.

His parts were too numerous. The deficient numbers resembled Cyclops, who had but one eye; whilst the perfect numbers have the temperament of a middle limit, and are the emula- tors of Virtue, a medium between excess and defect, not the summit, as some ancients falsely thought. Evil is indeed opposed to evil, but both to one good. Good, however, is never opposed to good, but to two evils. The Perfect numbers are also like the virtues, few in number; whilst the other two classes are like the vices--- numerous, inordinate and indefinite. There is but one perfect number between 1 and 10, that is 6; only one between 10 and 100, that is 28; only one between 100 and 1000, that is 496; and between 1000 and 10,000 only one, that is 8128. Odd numbers they called Gnomons, because, being added to squares, they keep the same figures as in Ge- ometry.

Wyn n We s t c ot t A number, which is formed by the multiplication of an odd and an even number together, they called Hermaph- rodite , or “ arrenothelus.” In connection with these notes on parity and imparity, definite and indefinite numbers, it is to be noted that the old philosophers were deeply imbued with the union of numerical ideas with Nature---in its common accepta- tion, and also to the natures, essences or substrata of things. The nature of good to them was definite, that of evil indefinite; and the more indefinite the nature of the evil, the worse it was. Goodness alone can define or bound the indefinite. In the human soul exists a certain vestige of divine goodness (Buddhi). This bounds and moder- ates the indefiniteness and inequality of its desires. 20. It may be demonstrated that all inequality arises from equality, so that obtaining, as it were, the power of a mother and a root, she pours forth with exuberant fertil- ity all sorts of inequality; and did space and time allow, it could be also shown that all inequality may be reduced to equality.

Wyn n We s t c ot t are like friends, they are Amicable numbers, as 284 and 220. Pythagoras, being asked what a friend was, said etepos eyw = ” another I.” Now this is demonstrated to be the case in these numbers. The parts of each are generative of each other, according to the nature of friendship. Ozanum, a French mathematician, A.D 1710, gives ex- amples in his “ Mathematical Recreations” of such Ami- cable Numbers. He remarks that 220 is equal to the sum of the aliquot parts of 284. Thus 1+ 2+ 4+ 71+ 142= 220; and 284 is equal to the sum of the aliquot parts of 220. Thus 1+ 2+ 4+ 5+ 10+ 11+ 20+ 22+ 44+ 55+ 110= 284. Another such pair of numbers is 17,296 and 18,416. Very curious speculations as to the relation between Numbers and Marriage, and the character of offspring from it, are to be found scattered through the writings of the Philosophers. Plato, in his “ Republic,” has a pas- sage concerning a geometric number, which, divinely generated, will be fortunate or unfortunate. Nicomachus also speaks of this same number, and he calls it the Nuptial Number; and he passes from it to state that from two good parents only good offspring can come. From two bad parents only bad; and from a good and a bad parent only bad. Whence he warns the Republic against wedlock in a confused or disorderly manner, \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0002\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Nu m b e r s ---Th e ir O c cu lt Powe r An d Mys t ic Vir t u e s B y W.

Simplicius, in his commentary on the 2 nd Book of Aristotle, “ On the Heavens,” remarks that Pythagoras and his followers claimed to have heard the Music of the Spheres, to have heard an harmonic sound produced by the motion of the planets, and from the sound to have calculated by numbers the ratio of distance and size of the Sun, Moon, Venus and Mercury. 21. To this Aristotle objected, but perhaps the difficulty might be solved. In this sublunary sphere, all things are not commensurate, nor is everything sensible to every- body alike. Animals can be scented, and their presence definitely known, by dogs when at great distances from them, and when man is in complete ignorance of their existence. Some of the ancients thought the soul had three vehicles---the terrestrial body, an aerial one in which it is punished, and an ethereal one, luminous and celestial, in which the soul abides when in a state of bliss. It may be that some one, by purification of the senses, by hereditary magical power, or by probity, or by the sacred operations of his religion, may perceive, with a terrestrial body laid aside, things imperceptible to us, and hear sounds inaudible to us still in bondage.

It is with the Hebrew letters as nu- merals that we are chiefly con- cerned, and to a smaller extent with Greek. Ancient records show that the Greeks used their numbers almost exclusively for everyday purposes; while the Jewish Rabbis added to their practical value special peculiar purposes, and looked to them to furnish deeper views of nature, existence and doctrine. No doubt can exist that the ancient Egyptians were fully aware of the wondrous mysteries which numbers are able to disclose, so, considering that Greece, and neither Judea nor Babylon, succeeded to the empires of ancient Egypt, it is a curious fact how little knowledge of the dogmas of the Hierophants of Sais, Memphis and Thebes Greek literature has transmitted to us. The Jewish Rabbis discovered so much of interest and importance behind the merely superficial value of num- bers, and of words as their representatives, that they gradually developed a complete science of numerical conceptions apart from mathematics. This took the name of Kabalah or Qabalah, Cabbala, or even Cabala, words variously misspelt from QBLH---the Received Doctrine, from the root QBL, meaning to Receive.

With this system is associated the practice of pure As- trology, the divination of Fate by means of the Heavenly bodies, especially the formation of the so-called Horo- scopes---schemes of the arrangement of the Planets at the moment of Birth, from which all the important phases of the life can be inferred — by some few per-"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Nu m b e r s ---Th e ir O c cu lt Powe r An d Mys t ic Vir t u e s B y W.

The Kabalah became a means of handing down from one generation to another hidden truths, religious notions, secrets of nature, ideas of Cosmogony, and facts of history, in a form which was unintelligible to the uninitiated; and the revealing of the secrets, and the methods of interpretation were veiled in mystery, and only to be approached through Religion. The more practical part of the system was involved in the three processes of Gematria, N otariqon and Temura . 1. Gematria , a method depending on the fact that each Hebrew letter had a numerical value. When the sum of the numbers of the letters composing a word was the same as the sum of the letters of an- other word, however different, they perceived an analogy between them, and considered them to have a necessary connection. Thus certain num- bers got to be well known as meaning certain things; and not words only, but sentences were treated in this manner; thus, as an example refer- ring to Genesis XVIII. V. 2, we find the words, “ and lo, three men,” Vehennah, shalisha, Vhnh Shlsh; this set down in numbers becomes 6, 5, 50, 5, 300, 30, 300, 5, which amount to 701. Now the words, “ these are Michael, Gabriel and Raphael,” “ Alu Mikhael Gabriel ve Raphael,” Alu Mikal GBRIAL V Rpal converted are 1, 30, 6, 40, 10, 20, 1, 30, 3, 2, 200, 10, 1, 30, 6, 200, 80, 1, 30, also amounting to 701, and the Rabbis argued that \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0002\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Nu m b e r s ---Th e ir O c cu lt Powe r An d Mys t ic Vir t u e s B y W. Wyn n We s t c ot t these two sets of three beings were identical. Some Christian Kabalists point out that in Genesis xlix. V. 10 we find “ Yebah Shiloh,” YBA Shilh, “ Shiloh shall come,” which amount to 358. And that the word “ Messiah,” Mshych is 40, 300, 10, 8 or 358. But so is also Nachash, the Serpent of Moses, Nchsh, 50, 8, 300. And I must remark that the claim to translate Shilh, or, as some ancient He- brew MSS. write it, Shlh, by “ Shiloh,” in the sense of Jesus Christ, is farfetched. The word is simply “ rest,” or “ peace,” in its simplest meaning, but also is the Scorpio of the Chaldean Zodiac (related to Nachash, serpent) and “ Judah,” of whom Jacob is talking in the prophecy, is the sign of the Zodiac; Leo for “ Judah is a lion’s whelp” (the Chaldean Zodiac has a lion couchant), “ he crouches as a lion.” In this sense, then, “ the scepter shall not de- part from Judah,” i.e., power shall not leave Leo, until Leo, until Shelah, Shiloh or Scorpio shall come up or rise. Astronomy teaches that as Leo passes away from the meridian, Scorpio rises. The title “ Comforter,” “ Menachem,” Mnchm, 40, 50, 8, 40, amounting to 138, and the title “ The Branch,” applied to the Messiah in Zechariah iii. V. 8, namely, Tzmch, 90, 40, 8 also 138, are of the same number. Metatron, the great angel MThRThn, and Shaddai ShDI, Sh, = 300 is used as a glyph of the “ the spirit of the living gods,” Ruach Elohim Ruch ALHIM, which transmutes into 200, 6, 8, 1, 30, 5, 10, 40 or 300.

The Kabalists sometimes considered the units to refer to Divine Beings, the tens to celestial bodies, hundreds to things of earth, and thousands to future events. 2 . N otariqon , a word derived from the Latin no- tarius, a shorthand writer, means the construction of a word from the initial or final letters of the several words of a sentence; or vice versa the con- struction of a sentence of which each word in or- der begins with the several letters composing a given word----processes of contraction and expan- sion, therefore. 27. Refer to Deuteronomy xxx. V. 12, and find that Moses asks, “ Who shall go up for us to heaven?” the initials of the words of the sentence, My Yolh Lnu HshMymh, read “ My yeolah lenu hashemimha,” form the word MYLH or “ Mylah,” which means “ Circumcision,” and the final letters from the word Jehovah, Yhuh or IHVH, suggest- ing that Jehovah pointed out the way, by circumci- sion, to heaven. Again, the first six letters of the book of Genesis, Brashit, Berasit, translated “ In the beginning,” but more properly “ In wisdom,” are the initials of the words Brashit Rah Alhim Shyqblu Ishral Turh, read “ Berasit rauah Elohim \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0002\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Nu m b e r s ---Th e ir O c cu lt Powe r An d Mys t ic Vir t u e s B y W.

Temura means Permutation; sometimes the let- ters of a word are transposed according to certain rules, and with certain limitations; at others each letter of a word is replaced by another according to a definite scheme, forming a new word, of which permutation there are many recognized forms. For example, the alphabet of 22 letters is halved and the two sets placed one over the other in reverse order, thus:--- A B G D H V Z Ch Th Y K T Sh R Q Tz P O S N M L Then A is changed to T, and V to P, and so on; so Babel= Bbl becomes Sheshak, i.e., ShShk used by Jeremiah xxv.

Wyn n We s t c ot t “ the combinations of Tziruph.” Other Permuta- tions were named Rational Right, Averse and Ir- regular; These are produced by forming a square and subdividing it by 21 lines in each direction into 484 smaller squares, and then writing in each square a letter in order successively from right to left, or from above down, or the reverse. The most popular mode of permutation has however been the form called “ Kabalah of the Nine Chambers,” produced by the intersection of two horizontal and two vertical lines, forming nine spaces, a central square, and 4 three-sided figures, and 4 two-sided figures, to each of which are allotted certain letters; there are several modes even of this arrangement, and there is a mystical mode of allotting the Sephi- roth to this figure, but this is a Rosicrucian secret. 28. This method is used in a superficial manner in Mark Master Masonry. A further development of the Numerical Kabalah con- sists of arithmetical processes of Extension and Con- traction; thus Tetragrammaton is considered as Y 10, H 5, V 6, H 5, or 26, but also may be spelled in full Yvd 20, Ha 6, Vv 12, Ha 6, or 44.

Wyn n We s t c ot t or 28. After another manner they contracted, as 28 was equal to 2 and 8 or 10. Again, Tetragrammaton 26 be- came 2 and 6, or 8 , so every number was reducible to a primary numeral . In this manner, within certain restrictive laws, every word had analogies with certain others. Thus Ab father 1 and 2 are 3, Ihv Jehu 10 and 5 and 6 are 21, 2 and 1 are 3. Al Shdi, Al Shaddai, God Almighty, 1, 30, 300, 4, 10 or 345, becomes 12, and then 2 and 1 are 3. Hva or Hoa 5, 6, 1 are 12, and then 3. And Gdvlh Gedulah 3, 4, 6, 30, 5 are 48 and are 12 and 3. Another method of substitution leading to results of an opposite character is the substitution in any word of similar letters of another group, hard for soft, or sibilant for dental; thus in Tm= perfect, exchange Th for T, and obtain Thm, meaning defiled. Shan, secure, tranquil, becomes San, battle; Shkl, wisdom, becomes Skl, foolish. In the word Shaddai, Shdi, Almighty, with soft sibilant and soft dental is Shiddah, a wife. If we replace with a hard dental, a partial change of meaning is effected, ShThH, Sittah, an adulterous wife. Both letters hardened completely change the sense, Sth, Seth, a fallen man, a backslider. Sthn, Satan, adversary. 29.

Wyn n We s t c ot t A deep mystery is concealed in the Genetic account of the conversion of the names of Abram, Abrm, into Abraham, Abrhm, and that of his wife, Sarai, Shri, into Sarah, Shrh, see Genesis xvii. V. 5-15, on the occasion of the conception of Isaac, Ytzchq or Yshchq, from the root Shchq or Tzchq, “ laugh,” when Sarah was 90 and Abraham 100 years old. This was on the occasion of the covenant made by Jehovah with Abram and the institu- tion of circumcision of males in token thereof. Now here we have the addition of an H or 5, the essentially Female Letter, to the name of Abraham, and a conver- sion of a Yod into He, Y into H, in the case of Sarah; and then their sterility is destroyed. Some learned men consider Abraham to be a conversion of Brahma, the Hindu Deity. The name splits up curi- ously. Ab is Father, Br is son, Am is like Om or Aum, a deific name of Power. Rm meant, “ he is lifted up.” Blavatsky remarks that Abraham and Saturn were identi- cal in Astro-symbology. The Father of the Pharisees was Jehovah, and they were of the seed of Abraham. The number of Abrm is 1, 2, 200, 40 or 243, the number of the man figure, Seir Anpin, representing Micropro- sopus.

It will be noticed that the great number of Sol is 666, called Sorath, Surt, the number of the Beast, about, which so much folly has been written. One famous square of five times five divisions, amounting in most directions to 666, is formed of the mystic words sator, arepo, tenet, opera, rotas . Of these the first, third and last number 666, but opera and its reverse number only 356. The number 608 is notable, being in Coptic, Phre, the Sun 500, 100, 8. And in Greek we find VHS, 400, 8, 200, which becomes IHS in Latin, for the Greek Upsilon changes to Y and I in Latin, and so we obtain the ana- gram of “ Iesus hominum Salvator.” Kircher points out a Greek example of Magic Squares. The names of Jesus and Mary, and IESOUS MARIA have a curious relation. Iesous is 10, 8, 200, 70, 400, 200= 888. Now take Maria, 40, 1, 100, 10, 1= 152. Set 152 in a Magic Square of Three, i.e. nine compartments, thus, 1-5-2, 5-2-1, 2-1-5, then the totals are all 888. The letters of Iesous also make a Magic Square of 36 divi- sions, adding every way to 888. Consult the “ Arithmolo- gia” of Kircher.

It remains by itself among num- bers, for no number can be taken from it, or separated from its unity. Proculs observed that “ The first monad is the world itself; the second is the inerratic sphere; then, thirdly, succeed the spheres of the planets, each a unity; then lastly, are the spheres of the elements which are also Monads;” and these as they have a perpetual subsis- tence are called wholenesses---holotetes in Greek. \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0002\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Nu m b e r s ---Th e ir O c cu lt Powe r An d Mys t ic Vir t u e s B y W.

The number one is represented in the Roman and Ara- bic systems, by an upright simple line, but in many old systems whose numerals were their letters, we find that almost universally the letter A, from being chosen to commence the set of letters, had the task of representing the Monad. In numeration, note that the Romans began with lines, I, II, III, IIII, and then followed the Acute Angle V for 5, then for ten this was doubled X, for fifty the angle was laid down and became L, for a hundred, two fifties, one inverted became C, for five hundred C and L became D.

Of figures, those, which are characterized by equality and sameness, have relation to the Monad; but those in which inequality and difference predominate are allied to the Dyad. Monad and Dyad are also called Bound and Infinity. 1.

The followers of Pythagoras spoke of two kinds of en- joyment.

Hierocles says two things are necessary to life, the aid of kindred , and benevolent sympathy of one’s neighbors. A notable ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic was formed of two serpents in connection with a globe or egg, repre- senting the world. Another celebrated pair, in connec- tion with worship, is the association of a tree and a ser- pent, referring as some say to the Mosaic account of the Tree of Knowledge and the Tempter Serpent. Some have supposed that it is only since the condemnation “ on thy Belly shalt thou go” that the Serpent has been limbless and obliged to crawl. Note, it has been argued, and by a great churchman too, that the whole tale rests on error, and that for serpent we should read “ Ape” (Rev. Adam Clarke).

Every Jew who goes from the Synagogue to his house on the eve of the Sabbath is accompanied by two angels, one good and one bad, and if the house is all in order the good angel confirms a blessing, but if it be in disor- der, the good angel has to say Amen to the condemna- tion spoken by the evil angel. 39.

Other monograms of Jehovah were also triple; thus 3 rays and the Shin, and three Yods in a tri- angle.

In the Roman Cultus, the number 3 is of constant oc- currence, as for example see Virgil, Eclogue 8, The Pharmaceutria; the priests used a cord of 3 colored strands and an image was carried 3 times round an altar. “ Terna tibi haec primum triplici diversa colore.” The Druids also paid a constant respect to this number and even their poems are noted as being composed in Triads. It is not necessary here to enlarge upon the transcendent importance of the Christian Trinity. In old paintings we often see a Trinity of Jesus with John and Mary. In the “ Timaeus” of Plato, the Divine Triad is called Theos---God, Logos---The Word and Psyche, the Soul.

And again in the various faiths we see the chief Dignity given in turn to each person of the Triad. Some rejoice in the patriarchal Unity, some in the greater glory of the Son, and others again lavish all their adoration on the Great Mother. Even in trinities of coequal males, each has his own special worshippers. Note this especially among the Hindus, where for example, the followers of Vishnu are called Vaishnavas. To complicate matters too, in this case, each deity has his female potency or sakti, and these also have their own adherents. 44.

In the ancient Egyptian form of burial, while the body was made into a swathed mummy, the internal organs of the chest and abdomen were removed and preserved in 4 jars, often called the Canopic Jars; they were dedicated to the 4 Genii of the Cardinal points, who were at times called the Children of Horus. The jar of Amset, Amesheth or Mestha, the South, was man-shaped, and in it were put the stomach and large intestines; in the jar of Hapi, or Ahephi, the North, dog-headed, were the small intestines; in the jar of Tuamutef or Toumath- path, the East, jackal-headed, were the heart and lungs, and in the jar of Khebsenuf or Kabexnuf, hawk-headed, the West, were the liver and gall bladder.

Magic Squares were first known by the work of a Greek, Emanuel Moscopulos, still existing in MSS. of the 16 th Century in the National Library of Paris. Cornelius Agrippa then gave the Planetary Squares, which have been many times copied in subsequent books. From a more mathematical point of view, they have been much studied in France by M. Bachet and M. Frenicle, M. Poignard of Brussels and de la Hire. M. De La Loubere gives information of the use of Magic Squares by the Indians of Surat. To the number 4 belong the several forms of the cross, Maltese, Greek, Passional, St. Andrew’s and the Fylfot cross— the Swastika.

There are Seven Planes of being, the up- per three are subjective and unknowable to mankind, the lower four are objective and may be contemplated by man as metaphysical abstractions. So there are the Seven Principles of Man, and the upper triad are parted from the lower group of four at dissolution. 79. The Seven Principles constituting man are variously named by the Esoteric Buddhism, by the Vedantic scheme, and by other philosophies, but they correspond in idea. First from above come Atma, a ray from the Absolute; Buddhi, spiritual soul; and Manas, human soul; these are the superior triad, which separates at hu- man death from the lower tetrad of principles. The lower four are Kama Rupa, the passions; Linga Sarira, the astral body; Prana, life essence; and Sthula Sarira, the lower body; see the dogmas of Esoteric Buddhism. The Kabalah divides these into four planes of the Soul, which are further separated by adepts; these are Chiah, Neshamah, Ruach and Nephesh, which correspond to the symbolical worlds of Atziluth, Briah, Yetzirah and Assiah.

Hence the Ogdoad was also called “ Cadmeia,” because Harmony was looked upon as the wife of Cadmus and Cadmus meant the Sub-lunary World, as Olympiodorus says. Eight was called also Mother, and Rhea, Cybele and Dindymene, from being the first cube, and a cube representing the earth. The eight persons saved from the flood of Xisuthrus are synonyms of many octaves of gods, such as the 8 Cabiri great gods of Samothrace; see Bryant and Faber on this myth. There are 8 Beatitudes of the Christian religion, Mat- thew, chap. V. Eight is the number of the Moons of Saturn. There have been several Masonic orders concerned with this Noachite Ogdoad, as the Prussian masons, Knights of the Royal Axe, or Prince of Libanus, the Noachites, and the Royal Ark Mariners, which is a subsidiary order to the Mark Master Masons.

Lars Porsena led the Etruscans; they were then most power- ful; from the Estrucans the Romans took much of their law, custom and superstition. \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0002\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Nu m b e r s ---Th e ir O c cu lt Powe r An d Mys t ic Vir t u e s B y W.

Hence, the jocular Latin saying, Tres mulieres Nundinas faciunt. These Nundi- nals are a type of our Dominical letters, a set of seven marking out the 8 th days. The Romans also held a purifi- cation ceremony on male infants on the 9 th day of life, hence the presiding goddess of this rite was called Nundina. The Nones were one of the sets of days composing each calendar month. The Roman Novennalia was a feast in memory of the dead celebrated every 9 th year.

A similar form is given by Hebrew Kabalists to form 72, the deity num- ber, by placing in a triangle four Yods, three Hehs, two Vavs and one Heh final, being the letters IHVH of the Tetragrammaton; or they may be put conversely.

Apuleius states that among the Egyptians it was custom- ary to fast 10 days before sacrificing and Budge says that they used a 10-day week. \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0002\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Nu m b e r s ---Th e ir O c cu lt Powe r An d Mys t ic Vir t u e s B y W.

These three form the Supernal Triad. The fourth and fifth are Chsd, Chesed, Mercy, active and male, and Gbvrh, Geburah, Strength, passive and female.

The whole Ten are viewed as reigning over Four Worlds or Planes of Existence. These are the Worlds of At- ziluth, Briah, Yetzirah and Assiah. Malkuth on the plane of Assiah alone is the visible tangible universe. These Ten Sephiroth are the prototypes of everything spiritual and also of every part of creation. They are traced in the angelic host and in our universe. Three su- perior and seven succedent exist in all things. The lower seven are obvious to the uninitiated, but in these mani- festations, the Supernal Triad is veiled to the profane. Some occultists phrase it thus — three are subjective and incomprehensible to man; seven are objective and com- prehensible.

These Ten Sephiroth are not only viewed as triads from above below, but are also imaged in three columns enti- tled the Pillars of Severity and Mercy, with the median of Benignity or Mildness. But this scheme is not for this treatise, nor can the Sephirotic alliance with the Plane- tary symbols, the angelic host, the divine names and the Book of Thoth, or Tarot be here described. These sub- jects present a mine of wisdom concealed in the rituals of the Kabalistic “ Chabrath zereh Aur bokher,” from whose parent stem the Rosicrucian Fraternities also may have arisen. These Rituals contain a more complex scheme of the mediaeval occult symbolism than exists in any other form known to me, and I believe that it would not be possible for anyone to reconstitute so complete a system out of all extant literature. There are 10 Grades in the Rosicrucian Society. They are Zelator, Theoricus, Practicus, Philosophus; Minor, Major and Exempt Adept; Master, Magus and King.

Each sign was further subdivided into three decans. There are many of the learned who believe the twelve sons of Jacob and twelve founders of tribes, are allegorical only. We may mention the “ Twelve Grand Points of Masonry,” which used to form a part of the lectures in the Craft degrees. Twelve events in the ceremony of initiation, referred to the sons of Jacob, are given by Mackey: 1. To Reuben was referred the opening of the Lodge— he was the first-born son. 2 . To Simeon, the preparation of the land— he prepared the destruction of the Shechemites. 3 . To Levi, the report or signal— he gave the signal in the attack on the men of Shechem. 4 . To Judah, the entrance of the land— that tribe first entered the Promised Land."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Nu m b e r s ---Th e ir O c cu lt Powe r An d Mys t ic Vir t u e s B y W.

When these names were given, the Sun entered Aries at the Vernal Equinox, and Sign and constellation coincided; now they do not, so do not be confused by our still calling the first Sign of spring Aries, although the Sun is now really at such time in Pisces; \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0002\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Nu m b e r s ---Th e ir O c cu lt Powe r An d Mys t ic Vir t u e s B y W.
