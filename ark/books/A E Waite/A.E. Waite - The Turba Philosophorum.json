It is not, of course, certain that the original is irretrievably lost, the Arabic and Syriac manuscripts treating of early chemistry are preserved in considerable numbers in the various libraries of Europe, and have only been imperiectly explored. Unfortunately, the present editor has neither the opportunity nor the qualifications for undertaking such a task. There are two codices or recensions of The Turba Philosophorum, which differ considerably from one another. What is called in the following pages the second recension, is appreciably shorter, clearer, and, on the whole, the less corrupt of the two, but they are both 2094035"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"ii.

The variations of the second recension are appended usually in foot-notes, but where the reading of the text is so corrupt as to be quite untranslatable, the editor has occasionally substituted that of the alternative version, and has in most cases indicated the course pursued. Monsieur Berthelot's invaluable text and translation of the Byzantine Alchemists has been largely made use of, to illustrate the striking analogies between the Greek Hermetic writers of the fourth century and the Turba. It is to this great scholar and scientist that we owe the discovery of these analogies, some of which are very clearly indicated in a chapter devoted to the subject, and forming part of his \" Essai sur la Transmission de la Science Antique au Moyen Age.\" It follows from M. Berthelot's researches, that Latin Alchemy, which has always been rightly referred to an Arabian source, connects with the Greek Alchemy which preceded Arabian Science, because the latter was itself derived from Greece.

M.

The chief printed versions of The Turba Philo- sophorum, are those of the \" Theatrum Chemi- cum,\" the \" Bibliotheca Chemica Curiosa,\" and that of the smaller collection entitled \" Artis Auriferae Tractatus.\" There are some transla- tions of the work existing in German and some also in French. Those in the latter language are specially remarkable for the very slender way in which they represent the original. The versions contained in Salmon's \" Bibliotheque des Philosophes Alchimiques,\" and in the \" Tro's Anciens Traictes de la Philosophic Naturelle,\" are instances in point.

It may be added that the great collections of Alchemy, such as the \" Theatrum Chemicum \" and Mangetus, contain colloquies, commen- taries, and enigmas which pretend to elucidate the mysteries of The Turba Philosophorum. While they are of a considerably later date, they at the same time belong to the early period of Latin Alchemy. It may be added also that the editor has collected a consider- able amount of material concerning this curious work, which the limits of the present volume preclude him from utilising.

Therefore he had a mind to assemble his dis- ciples, who were now greatly increased, and had been constituted the chief persons throughout all regions for the discussion of this most precious Art, that their words might be a foundation for posterity. He then commanded Iximidrus, of highest council, to be the first speaker, who said :f * The Greek alchemists of the Byzantine Collection make no mention of Pythagoras, and the tradition which describes him as an adept of the Hermetic Mystery must be referred to an Arabian origin, to the treatises of El Habib, the Kitab-al-Firhirst, and the true Geber, where alchemical writings attributed to this sage are freely quoted. t The French version of Salmon has the following distinct variations : \" The beginning of the book, the Turba of the Philosophers, in which Arisleus has gathered together the sayings of the more prudent among the scholars, by introducing Pythagoras the Philosopher, that Master collecting the opinions of the scholars.

But God has provided the separating air, lest that which He has created should be burnt up. Do you not observe that the Sun when it rises in the heaven overcomes the air by its heat, and that the warmth penetrates from the upper to the lower parts of the air? If, then, the air did not presently breathe forth those winds whereby creatures are generated, the Sun by its heat would certainly destroy all that lives. But the Sun is kept in check by the air, which thus con- quers because it unites the heat of the Sun to its own heat, and the humidity of water to its own humidity. Have you not remarked how tenuous water is drawn up into the air by the action of the heat of the Sun, which thus helps the water against itself? If the water did not nourish the air by such tenuous moisture, assuredly the Sun would overcome the air.

Thus, fire and water are enemies between which there is no consanguinity, for the fire is hot and dry, but the water is cold and moist. The air, which is warm and moist, joins these together by its concording medium ; between the humidity of water and the heat of fire the air is thus placed to estab- lish peace. And look ye all how there shall arise a spirit from the tenuous \"vapour of the air, because the heat being joined to the humour, there necessarily issues something tenuous, which will become a wind. For the heat of the Sun extracts something tenuous out of the air, which also becomes spirit and life to all creatures. All this, however, is disposed in such manner by the will of God, and a coruscation appears when the heat of the Sun touches and breaks up a cloud.

The Second Dictum. EXUMDRUS saith : I do magnify the air according to the mighty speech of Iximidrus, for the work is improved thereby. The air is inspissated, and it is also made thin ; it grows warm and becomes cold. The inspissation thereof takes place when it is divided in heaven by the elongation of the Sun ; its rarefaction is when, by the exaltation of the Sun in heaven, the air becomes warm and is rarefied. It is comparable with the complexion of Spring,* in the distinction of time, which is neither warm nor cold. For according to the mutation of the con- * A similar comparison is used in the Arabian Book of Crates, where it is enjoined that the operation of the philosophical fire upon the philosophical matter should be regulated after the same manner as Nature regulates the influence of the four seasons ; and the same treatise, moreover, represents still older expositions of alchemical philosophy as using the same illustration.

The air, therefore, is inspis- sated when the Sun is removed from it, and then cold supervenes upon men. Whereat the TURBA said : Excel- lently hast thou described the air, and given account of what thou knowest to be therein. The Third Dictum. ANAXAGORAS saith : I make known that the beginning of all those things which God hath created is weight and proportion,* for weight rules all things, and the weight and spissitude of the earth is manifest in proportion ; but weight is not found except in body. And know, all ye Turba, that the spissitude of the four elements reposes in the earth ; for the spissitude of * The original is pietas et ratio, but the technical use of the term pietas by the Hebrew or Arabic original seems obviously to connect it with the sense of the Hebrew Paz, signifying compactness.

Have you not observed how the spissitude of the four elements is conjoined in earth ? The same, therefore, is more inspis- sated than all. Then saith the TURBA : Thou hast well spoken. Verily the earth is more inspissated than are the rest. Which, therefore, is the most rare of the four elements and is most worthy to possess the rarity of these four ? He answereth : Fire is the most rare among all, and thereunto cometh what is rare of these four. But air is less rare than fire, because it is warm and moist, while fire is warm and dry ; now that which is warm and dry is more rare than the warm and moist. They say unto him : Which element is of less rarity than air ? He answereth : Water, since cold and moisture inhere therein, and"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The Turba Philosophorum. g every cold humid is of less rarity than a warm humid. Then do they say unto him: Thou hast spoken truly. What, therefore, is of less rarity than water ? He answereth : Earth, because it is cold and dry, and that which is cold and dry is of less rarity than that which is cold and moist. PYTHAGORAS saith : Well have ye provided, O Sons of the Doctrine, the description of these four natures,* out of which God hath created all things. Blessed, therefore, is he who comprehends what ye have declared, for from the apex of the world he shall not find an intention greater than his own ! Let us, there- fore, make perfect our discourse. They reply : Direct every one to take up our speech in turn. Speak thou, O Pandolfus ! *\"You have been told . . . that the ancients discoursed of four elements. Know that it is by means of these four elements that humid and dry things are constituted, as also things warm and cold, the male and the female. Two [elements] rise up and two fall down.

The Fourth Dictum. But PANDOLFUS saith : I signify to- posterity that air is a tenuous matter of water, and that it is not separated from it. It remains above the dry earth, to wit, the air hidden in the water, which is under the earth. If this air did not exist, the earth would not remain above the humid water. They answer : Thou hast said well complete, therefore, thy speech. But he continueth : The air which is hidden in the water under the earth is that which sustains the earth, lest it should be plunged into the said water ; and it, moreover, prevents- the earth from being overflowed by that water. The province of the air is, therefore, to fill up and to make separation between diverse things, that is to say, water and earth, and it is constituted a peacemaker between hostile things, namely, water and fire, dividing these, lest they destroy one another.

He answer eth : An egg is an illustration, for therein four things are conjoined ; the visible cortex or shell represents the earth, and the albumen, or white part, is the water.* But a very thin inner cortex is joined to the outer cortex, representing, as I have signified to you, the separating medium between earth and water, namely, that air which divides the earth from the water. The yolk also of the egg represents fire ; the cortex which contains the yolk corresponds to that * The allegory of the philosophical egg can be traced to the Greek alchemists. A short treatise is still extant under this title, and another on the Nomenclature of the Egg, which is described as the Mystery of the Art. It is composed of four elements, because it is the image of the world. It is the stone which is not a stone, the stone of copper, the Armenian stone, &c. The shell is likened to the earth, being cold and dry ; it has been named copper, iron, tin, lead. The white of the egg is divine water, water of the sea, water of alum, &c. The yolk is copperas, native sulphur, mercury, &c. The oily part (? the chicken) is fire. But the egg, symbolical- as it is, is sometimes itself described symbolically, after the similitude of a seed ; the shell is likened to the skin which covers the seed ; the white and the yolk are the flesh, and the watery part is the breath, or air."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"12 The Turba Philosophorum. other air which separates the water from the fire. But they are both one and the same air, namely, that which separates things frigid, the earth from the water, and that which separates the water from the fire. But the lower air is thicker than the upper air, and the upper air is more rare and subtle, being nearer to the fire than the lower air In the egg, therefore, are four things earth, water, air, and fire. But the point of the Sun, these four excepted, is in the centre of the yolk, and this is the chicken. Conse- quently, all philosophers in this most excellent art have described the egg as an example, which same thing they have set over their work. The Fifth Dictum.

They answer : Thou hast spoken truly and excellently. And he : I will now give a further explanation. Know that this creature, that is to say, the world, hath a light, which is the Sun, and the same is more subtle than all other natures, which light is so ordered that living beings may attain to vision. But if this subtle light were removed, they would become darkened, seeing nothing, except the light of the moon, or of the stars, or of fire, all which are derived from the light of the Sun, which causes all creatures to give light."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"The Turba Philosoplwnnn. 17 For this God has appointed the Sun to be the light of the world, by reason of the attenuated nature of the Sun. And know that the sublime creature before mentioned has no need of the light of this Sun, because the Sun is beneath that creature, which is more subtle and more lucid. This light, which is more lucid than the light of the Sun, they have taken from the light of God, which is more subtle than their light. Know also that the created world is composed of two dense things and two rare things, but nothing of the dense is in the sublime creature. Consequently the Sun is rarer than all inferior creatures.

These are earth and water. But there are two other elements which are neither visible nor tangible, which yield naught, whereof the place is never seen, nor are their opera- tions and force known, save in the former elements, namely, earth and water ; now when the four elements are not com- mingled, no desire of men is accom- plished.

For example, the Byzantine fragment entitled The Nomenclature of the Egg affirms that the egg is the image of the world, and hence is composed of the four elements. t The philosophical copper is a subject of continual reference throughout all alchemy. Among the earliest au- thorities, the Book of Crates says that copper, like man, has a spirit, soul, and body.

Berthelot has pointed out that the use of the term nummus by the Latin alchemists is a misconception of the meaning of anterior writers. The reference is to Asem, an alloy of gold and silver. t Numerous preparations for whitening and reddening will be found in the Collection of Ancient Greek Alchemists, as, for example, the Combination of the White Preparation in the Address of Isis to Horus, the recipe in the twenty- first paragraph of the Natural Questions of Democritus, again in the Book of Synesius, the Philosopher, addressed to Dioscorus, and elsewhere in many places. It is invariably an operation with copper. The book addressed by Democritus to Leucippus says that the alchemical work comprises the process of making white and making yellow (red), as also the softening and coction of the mineral of copper. According to Synesius, the process of whitening is a calcination, and making yellow is an igneous regenera- tion.

Consequently, the Philosophers, when committing these things to writing that the same might not perish, have not set forth in their books the manifest disposition, lest every one should become acquainted therewith, and having become familiar to fools, the same would not sell it at a small price.

But the blackness and redness appear, and it falls into sickness, and dies by rust and putrefaction ; properly speaking, then, it has not a flight, although it is desirous to escape servitude ; then when it is free it follows its spouse, that a favourable colour may befall itself and its spouse ; its beauty is not as it was, but when it is placed with coins, it makes them gold.

And know that when the water has become powder then has it been ground diligently. But if ye ask, how is the water made a powder ? note that the intention of the Philosophers is that the body before which before it falls into the water is not water may become water ; the said water is mixed with the other water, and they become one water. It is to be stated, therefore, that unless ye turn the thing mentioned into water,* ye shall not attain to the work. It is, therefore, necessary for the body to be so possessed by the flame of the fire that it is dis- integrated and becomes weak with the water, when the water has been mentary of Agathodaimon upon the Oracle of Orpheu* is extant in the Greek collection. * The second recension reads : \" unless ye turn both into water.\""},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"The Turbo, Philosophorum. 117 added to the water, until the whole be- comes water.

And he : O all ye Sons of the Doctrine, when mixing Magnesia, place it in its vessel, the mouth of which close carefully, and cook with a gentle fire until it liquefy, and all become water therein ! For the heat of the water acting thereupon, it becomes water by the will of God. When ye see that the said water is about to become black, ye know that the body is already liquefied.

The question being what is the difference between the mercury which is obtained from cinnabar, and that which is obtained from arsenic, the Philosopher explains that while all mercury is one, there are still a variety of sorts, and he quotes Hermes: \" The ray of honey is white,\" and \" the ray of honey is"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"The Turba Philosophorum. 119 persons uncover it, say, once in each week, or once in every ten nights; in either case, the ultimate perfection of pure water appears at the end of forty days, for then it completely absorbs the humour of the decoction.

Hence the envious have said : Wash the Magnesia with soft water, and cook diligently, until it become earth, and the humour perish. Then it is called copper.

In the Turba Philotophorum, dew appears under another aspect, as possessing an inherent virtue apart from the vital presence and activity of the solar rays.

So is it imposed upon coin. Conclusion.* AGMON saith : I will add the following by way of a corollary. Whosoever does not liquefy and coagulate errs greatly. Therefore, make the earth black ; separate the soul and the water thereof, afterwards whiten ; so shall ye find what ye seek. I say unto you that whoso makes earth black and then dissolves with fire, till it becomes even like unto a naked sword, who also fixes the whole with consuming fire, deserves to be called happy, and shall be exalted above the circle of the world.
