Many letters tram AC to SA − dealt with in his absence by Cadbury Jones. AC's family brewers of C. Alton Ales; AC called himself Lord of his farm estate in Scotland. SA described Fr.

Sat Bahai invented by Archer. Pattinson's Order of Light combination of Sat Bahai and others − SA thinks highly of it.

SA always talked on Hermetic subjects with Woodford. SA says ciphers of Chymical Marriage decode into German − he has interwritten them in my book (i.e. R.H.R.) but it comes to nothing.

Bringing copyright action could be expensive unless successful. If writ could not be served on AC then threat of prosecution to publishers might delay delivery of next Equinox (said by SR). Seems printers (Ballantyne) might he glad of excuse to stop ptg. Eq− from course taken by Regnum Dei. AC: Sub Spe doesn't think he would go into witness box: no−one knows where he is living; living again with his wife as the divorce was due to collusion with aim of getting money from Kelley. SR dubious about this as £1000 p.a. comes from AC's mother and money from Kelly to his wife. Scottish court investigating poss. of collusion. If a writ is served mould need £25−50 paid in bank as prosecutor (DDCF) lives abroad, so DDCF will visit England, staying with a woman friend to have an address. SA has told DDCF to be in England by March 1. Resurgam will have nothing to do with the action as he could show no interest in the copyright. R. suggests that all existing Temples should recognise DDCF as titular head while remaining autonomous, also invited SS to be chief in R's temple; SS will join but not accept post of chief. SS admitted he is chief of S.M. Inner Branch but it seems there are wardens with titles as in Outer Order; he himself is Theoricus, very keen for \"further knowledge\". Said Vestigia became 6=5 ten years ago but hadn't qualified. Vestigia said went through a ceremony but Vigilate says this is not so. SS says he has heard from Vest. and she is ready for 7=4, so he has been in touch with DDCF. SS says only one side at case against DDCF was heard but at the time he agreed with expulsion and joined council to manage Order − probably DDCF and SS have been working to get Temples back under one head (DDCF titular and SS acting head in Britain). SS says anyone can be a mystic but one must be born an occultist or magician − I think that those who follow the Divine Path attain God while those who follow the path of perdition go easily to the devil. SR told SS that DDCF had nothing for his Temple. Resurgam knows of other London Temples but is confused. Thinks that S.Keels(?) has temple at Acton with which SR is connected but not as head. SR doubts SS's word over this. SS talked as if many people (i.e. his members) had 6=5 and stressed the 7=4, speaking as if he knew SR's Higher degrees and saw them as not the real thing. The talk was cordial save for SS manner. SS said he refused to tell Resurgam about Temples he knew of. SR thought FR would jump at Titular head idea; suspects SS may be Inner Wardan of FR's branch, thus voiding concordat, FR says SS is Praemonstrator of Outer Grades, SR suspecting he may hold this position in thn Inner. Not clear from what SS actually said whether this was so. SS said SA held full 6=5 but 7=4 only in honorary way. To serve writ on AC they will use a \"safe woman\" to act as inquirer into C.' AA and carry the writ with her. (Addendum: \"I took care that my Temple contributed nothing to the expenses of DDCF in respect of his suit which was duly lost\" Something came from Resurgam and prob.

Does not know that SS has joined R. Temple under DDCF, thinks he is still reflecting on FR's proposal. This last confirmed over telephone to SR by \"Nobis est Victoria, speaking on the square\" Heard of astrological knowledge issued by DDCF for 6=5 and 7=4, concerned somehow with fixed stars Aldebaran and Fomalhaut and others. (Gives details) FR giving up much by renouncing this knowledge: but he thinks DDCF has nothing we could not get elsewhere. SR said that DDCF had long since ceased to have any connection with 3rd order so his knowledge of no value. FR writing to SS to offer choice between him or Resurgam − with Concordat in formner case, but he sees that SS may be out for supremacy over all temples in Britain with DDCF as titular head. FR has seen Mrs. St.John's £1400 opal, once in Spanish then French crowns, Mrs St.J. advised to make it an offering to Our Lady at some shrine or other as it belongs to Out Lady.

Second Order Hist. lecture was also not to be copied. Enochian Tablets lecture given to Philosophi Tattwas lecture not intended for the ordor. Perhaps Fortiter put it into circulation when she gained important position.5=6 grade before 2nd Order completed; SA showed Fortiter single sheet with diagram of Cruces Ansatae over altar for the grade. Told by SA that much difficulty had in translating 5=6 grade cipher being in alternate lines of French, English and Latin (thus no translation needed !!) There was \"red ink\" on the sheets but SA did not say it was copy of cipher. At 5=6 grade DDCF told Fortiter that there were people above him. She knew Inner Order was under way. Took 5=6 degree at Thavie's Inn, no roof on vault and paint on Crook and Scourge still wet. Fortiter first to take 5=6. DDCF, VNR and SA took obligation from each other. All arrangements of both orders there in confusion. F. had Hexagram and Pentagram lectures at Florence soon after with list of 2nd Order examinations. F. then went to Venice where Vestigia stayed with her. Had changed and developed Mania − told F. that they were mixed up in politics as would she be also. Weren't explicit about political work. Sub Spe came on scene about this tims. DDCF hadn't been to Paris when F. took 5=6. F. took it early In 1891. Her first payment to Vestigia as an art−student was made March 17, 1891.

Harley St. doctor setting up temple in London under DDCF, Not connected with Resurgam, DDCF dissuaded from appealing over his lost copyright action; he returns soon to Paris. Great secret FR had From SA is: (1) Persons aiming to revive G.D. were SA, Woodman and Woodford. (2)DDCF co−opted later to work up rituals (3) Ciphers came first to Woodford. SR asked FR, on his Masonic honour, whether he was led to believe that the ciphers were forced − he said not. SR recited his own grounds far suspicion over ciphers: (1) Reference to Ritual of Dead (2) to Rose of Creation &thus to E. Levi (3) familiarity with Book of Dead, inferred from ritual of Path of Tau.

SA had heard from DDCF who had offered to withdraw charges against SA, thus making SA think he could action DDCF for libel, this being a confession of guilt! With letter was tranalation (or copy) of document: 1 8 January 25, 1888 To the Frater Non Omnis Moriar, I authorise you to sign my Motto \"Sapiens Dominabitur Astris\" to any papers which are necessary to carry out my wishes as to forming temples and carrying an the work of the Order. Faithfully yours, Sap Dom Ast 7=4 2 Sent to FR after asking for information as to warrant under which SA began to work. Letter with it referred to warrant of Isis−Urania − claimed by DDCF to have been forged. (Not in fact so.SR) FR said DDCF's charges mere forging letters &signatures of SDA and forging the warrant. Letter quoted supposed to justify all existing signatures, but SR knows only of those on old rolls. FR has original I−U warrant, allegedly from 3rd order but prob. from SS who could have obtained it at the time of the split. SA had referred an acquaintance of AC who wished to join the Ros. Order to FR; she called on FR who \"treated her rather brusquely\" − she seems to be wealthy. SR thinks that the SDA letter is spurious being uncharacteristic of a high adept. SS is in comm. with DDCF and has received paper (prob. Theoricus stuff) which are promised to FR − but FR seems unaware of the risks of going in with SS and thus being under him.

FR would be sorry if it were terminated. He says that there are no Co−Equal chiefs with him in his Second Order and no chiefs who are not un−equal. Thought that NEVs contradiction of this due to NEV being Cancellarius in Outer Order and thinking he was thus a chief In the Inner. FR showed SR a pledge of two neophytes received into his branch last Saturday accepting FR as sole guide − but it is irrelevant to 2nd Order headship. FR has held no Inner meetings, save ceremonies, has never ornanised 2nd Order and has no constitution; has acted on his own responsibility and accepted whatever candidates he chose. FR read out letter from NEV showing latter's dissatisfaction, due says FR to his being nervous over reunion of SS and DDCF. Should this occur, FR would enforce SS retiring from St.Mat. FR showeed SR typed notes with signatures of SS and NEV saying that the concordat was solely FR's responsibility − this would support idea of single headship but why sign it if they heid no official position ? Prob. SS believes he holds same position as pre−spilt, but NEV never held office save that of Scribe when general meeting at MMH had division proposed by SR.

SA said that SS was planning to restore Amen−Ra Temple at Edinburgh which SA thinks will not be under DDCF (though SR disagrees) − SS asked 5a for original Consecration Ceremony used for first Amen−Ra but SA says he has't got it. FR had seen SS at Rebman's but nothing was said on the above. FR knows of SS intentions and has written saying that anyone joining a Temple under DDCF must resign from the St.Mat. − including SS, but he may not see it that way. SS has asked FR for loan or gift of Amen−Ra robes &properties; these had been given by SS earlier. FR will give them to him. Kate Moffat &W.Carnegie Dickson are keen to join the new Amen−Ra, both surprised that this would mean resigning from St.Mat. But FR would take FFJ back once he finds out how things are in Amen−Ra. Ex Oriente Lux (Meakin) tells FR that he has heard that AC has been warned by police to be out of England by Oct.15.(SR sceptical). FR says AC stole 6=5 and 7=4 rituals from DDCF and will publish them in Equinox. (SR sceptical of this − thinks they are invented ones of AC) SS has been to Oberammergau and on way via Paris saw DDCF − nothing said about it. In Germany, FR met Fraulein Anna Sprengel, c 65, supposedly niece of original and a patient of FR (treated at a distance) FR thinks Anna Sprengel may he name used by different people not related for occult reasons (one at a time). Meeting either in Amsterdam or Berlin, inhere SA was at time, but FR couldn't arrange meeting because QL (Mrs.F) wouldn't let FR out of her sight − SA saw her and wouldn't go for SDA meeting on account of Mrs. Westcott (Presumably Mrs. W. &QL did not mix well −RG) In tha same way QLs presence stopped FR meeting 3rd Order people. By having to postpone Saturday meeting to Monday FR lost chance of meeting those from whom he would have got Kieswetter mss. But he did, allegedly, meet some mysterious people. News from 3rd order is: Old retired London clergyman belongs to conclave in question FR has his name and address. Another name and address were given him, but he is to wait until approached by this person. FR was believed by 3rd Order to be involved with AC. Other info. from Third Order hindered by presence of QL. Alleged by others (not 3rd Order) that original GD (pre 1885) still exists in London − once included DDCF, SA &Panus. They have true cipher ms. that of DDCF being an imperfect copy \"improved\" by him, and arranged to fall into hands of Woodford. (SR says that this implies DDCF being deliberately after imposture because of faked watermark of 1809) Perhaps this is astral information. being the book copied by CRC in Arabia 3 XIII(Cont.) //FR maintains that there is Vatican ms. being the first matter of Rosicrucianism, also another Vatican ms. stolen and now in London. FR hopes to locate site of Damcar. He missed Equinox meeting of SM being fog−bound hack from America. In his place EOL acted as Imperator and told people that FR was sole head in London, also that concordat was his sole responsibility. FR thought 3rd Order was magical which SR believed did not make far Divine Union. They agreed to differ over the question or the Way.

TSoc people &3rd order object to SR revising rituals, because they feel nothing Rosicrucian should be printed (nor had been on their part). GD rituals thus not Ros. SR pointed out that English GD was no concern of theirs; they agreed so but said they did authorise GD. One original pre−l885 member was East end clergyman mentioned in Life of Anna K.

Woodford'ss mss including address af SDA were Ros. not GD; orig. GD had no German connection. 3rd order works Outer Temple in Germany on GD &Sephirotic lines. Thus SDA neither did nor could licence a temple. Story of how DDCF got 5=6 ritual told independently by DDCF to SA and by SA to FR. If true cipher is in BM, which is copy of which ?

He alleges that I told him I did not know about the Tarot Trumps. Those statements are untrue. When SS &wife went to Paris they were met by DDCF &V and given dinner and a concert. DDCF lives near Paris and carries out German (military) tactics an a large table. SS made honorary 7=4 but hasn't had the 6=5 or 7=4 rituals but has received 60−70 pages of Theoricus stuff. Has held first meeting of revived Amen−Ra, Kate Moffat present (see photocopy of members list. RG) Mrs Brodie−Innes has resigned from St.Mat., SS not yet. SS has received alleged outer order signs given by outer members (?) to 6=5 members. Differ entirely from Ordinary Signs. What does this mean? SS under DDCF although he denies it. Brasch people have started Temple independent, of Resurgam − paying 2l/− 4 of each entrance fee to DDCF. When In London SS attended a reception at Resurgam's house, allegedly worked well but cf. what said by Soror Mystica. FR affirms his determination to have nothing to do with DDCF − as becomes him with regard to German 3rd Order who have severed links with DDCF. Position is: DDCF alleges links with a 3rd Order but he lied; FR has succeeded in his links, but perhaps the two 3rd orders are not the same ? BUT: Up to recent times no German sequence of rites worked on a sephirotic system. SDA's grade of 7=4 should have been, on 1777 ritual basis, 7,3. FR says there are several German external temples; the Second order begins with a ritual corresponding to 5=6, it has six steps or degrees. In 3rd Order is nothing beyond 8=3 (SR says this is Daath) The 5=6 used by DDCF is not correct. FR does not know how original GD people got cipher or how it came to be in BM they have no 2nd or 3rd order. 5=6 sent to DDCF by Dr. Thiessen of Liege who died in 1909.

Either Woodford, QSN &SA gave DDCF the ritual to work up in which case he didn't produce them. If this is not true, SA has lied to SR. If DDCF showed rituals to the three who asked him to work them up then again SA has lied to SR. XV (Cont.)

Inner Grade people start temples in various countries − numbers are largely German but also French, English, Danish, Austrian, Italian &Russian. As original Inner members died out same temples were left to die away, others became purely outer. No set archives.

Members, largely Fourth degree &equivalent to 6=5, called together hurriedly for EOL's initiation, which was a shortened form of 3½ degrees; third like Tiphereth using our implements, fourth something like Geburah apparently involved coming out of a tomb. They divide Annie Bessant's 33 degrees into 9 because 33 was a blunder for 3*3=9 (which says little for their Occult knowledge). EOL says SR's folding Ros. diagram correct but they have Zelator equal to Malkuth (he thinks) and Theoricus, Practicus &Philosophus arc put together in No.2 as a portal to no.3 − all very muddled. EOL thinks they don't keep minutes, not needing them being occultists, Their promised teaching is a kind of marriage of occultism &Mysticism. IF they are genuinely old it would be fine to have material not had by SA. 3rd grade has no vault but mise−en−scene provided astrally; ritual was in a small chamber but EOL was hoodwinked and moved about often so had no idea of size.

FR will try to find intermediary between Thiessen and DDCF − postmark on envelope to SA is Liege Station so could have been sent while passing through. Grades in Germany meant to represent progress into manifestation. From unmanifest state, via development in manif. through Lemuria &Atlantis − first circumamb. is done backwards to rep. going back through earlier states. Masonic unclothing rejected by Germans. Thus new idea, as suggested by MWT. Collson in Germany, prob. taking degrees equivalent to what he has in SM.

Baron Walleen exceeded instructions; Meebold unauthorised. Above from QL. To stop SS getting hold of SM while FR is away, latter has left letters with Cephas (Peter Birchall) and Quis Separabit ?(Miss Childers) − they must refer to SR if SS pretends to have renounced DDCF. Any doubts or new members to come to SR. No 5=6 meeting; FR back from N.Z. for Vernal Equinox of 1913. SR given details of death of EOL, which death was itself painless. SR shown photo. repro. of warrant for Amen−Ra given to Dickson by SS −(signed by SA, Vestigia and prob. DDCF in the original) this copy dated 1893, signed by Macgregor Comte de Glenstrae:, SRMD as 5=6 and DDCF as 7=4. Great show of secrecy made, SS now out of SM Temple for opposing concordat about which he knew. Because of diff. between NEV and FR, letter attached to oid Rolls re−typed and signed again with Cephas in place of NEV. Three copies: one with FR, one with SR, one to go to Alpe &Ward, as does triplicate typed letter signed by FR and SR. Following EOLs death, FR now has many German papers; he may have not been sent them because he may not have been persona grata (as sugg. bv Lucem Spero) All these docs. placed in tin trunk at FR's bank. Cephas present Hierophant of outer grades. Laurence Felkin has joined Crowley Society; attended evocation of the Phoenix 12 that FR thinks was some kind of Black Mass (SR wonders why) − it included long invocations dancing etc. and operator (not AC himself) stripped to waist and gashed in form of cross; but blood didn't raise phoenix, ended in failure after 3 hrs. AC wants Laurence to go with his party to Davos. Heard more of Order at the Graal: XXXVII (Cont.) Order of Graal: EOL 40th Grand Master, his father was 39th. Datea from King Arthur, had suspension of some 300 years down to days of EOL's grandfather. Three chief grades: Page, Novice, knight. Also many subsidiary grades. Much occult material hut FR says there is nothing special concerning Graal. 3 Magi and during EOL's lifetime, FR was made Senior Magus. (FR had earlier told SR that he was far beyond EOL − but how could this be with EOL as Grand M. ?) No strangers to join unless there are 3 Knights in one Family (as when FR joined − being EOL, his father and his half−brother). Since EOLs death Order is in hands of FR. Thus FR is 41st GM but he doesn't wish to be; in which case GM will be a relative of EOL's in Scotland. Had EOL lived he would have made Denis Felkin a page, also would have knighted his Scottish relative, whose name FR wouldn't give to SR. Still wants SR to be the Second Magus. Complicated and difficult rits. In Knighthood grade 3 (or 5 or 7 ?) archangels clothe the candidate. (SR sceptical about whole thing −RG) XXXVII Meeting with FR October 8, 1912 39"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"XXXVIII Meeting with Henry Brasch (not dated) Brasch into Resurgam temple via Mrs. De Bashe Brasch? some 2 years ago. Both resigned. Founded own Temple after visit by DDCF− came to nothing, so rejoined old Temple B. as Sub−Cancellarius, she as Cancellarius. Wardends of Temple are: Imperator − Resurgam; Praemonstrator − Sub Spe; Cancellarius − Soror Mystica. They ahey 13 have renewed many properties as stuff at Cavendish Rooms is verminous. They had 6=5 grade by letter, asked by Resurgam to send £5.5.0 14 to DDCF; they refused and had insulting letters from DDCF so resigned once more. Prior to this Dr. Parrish resigned he had held 2nd order meetings in a Flat. No 2nd order meetings for 2½ years so Braach hasn't had 5=6. Two medals for 6=5 but no ritual. If neophyte pays 3gns. 15 then 2gns. goes to DDCF. Resurgam up to something with a Nurse Graham brought in by Soror Mystica whom he visited continually. Resurgam has 3 spirit children by an astral intercourse with on affinity. Bro. Brasch talked of Book Amash, extended by DDCF. For two years has worked an Claviculae Enochi. Worst book is Book of Concourse of Forces; Resurgam gave evidence against Crowley in Looking Glass case. Brasch has seen Faust magical mss. which he has translated partly; Brasch and Mrs. B both seem to he annoyed at not having offices in Resurgam's lot. Lamen of Chief Adept in 5=6 differs from that of SR. Temple Consecration ritual of DDCF includes obeisance to Isis. Brasch doesn't like Egyptian elements, prefers Christ Life. SR told him how his rituals were on the side of God. SRs order a path of symbolism, hence no knowledge promised. Soror Mystica's maiden name was Smith, daughter of late High Sheriff of Somerset and a Bristolian. Had unhappy marriage, has two children one a son of 28. Brasch offered loan of German Ros. work to SR and says Three Globes lodge lib. has many mss. Told SR much about German Freemasonry, 4th &5th grades; high grades Christian, derived from Sweden and Zinnendorf. Brasch's Grand Lodge is Kiel in Holstein Brasch is about 40. Had garbled idea of what Resurgam calls SR's rebellion. SR gave true story and about AC − many scandals put out by Resurgam about SR. Brasch embittered by Mrs. Sheffield. Brasch has had financial difficulties. Very high opinion of Soror Mystica with whom he is going to Australia. May stay there. Hadn't answered past letter of SR because of the return to DDCF. \"He is of course not a Gentleman\" (!! RG) XXXVIII Meeting with Henry Brasch (not dated) 40"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"XXXIX Meeting with Mr. Meebold May 7th, 1913 Meebold Emissary of Steiner, very keen to propagate Steiner views in England. Belongs to Steiner org. known to FR who had openned comm. by writing to Steiner. Thinks FR didn't understand what he saw; FR felt he couldn't carry on his group and appealed' to Steiner. Mss. from Germany only those sent by S. to anyone. CRC date is 13th cent. but gained from Akasic Records. As long as FR keeps his Order he will get nowhere with Steiner. XXXIX (Cont.) FR is not link between English and German Ros. FR's mss. can be bought in Germany by Steiner students − told to SR by a Steinerite member of his own. Meebald says Steiner casts aside old systems, hence math. attributions not from him. Prob. done by EOL. Early in Steiner period, Meebold became a Ros. in Rome but broke up order by disputing their knowledge. People concerned emotional but well−meaning and serious. M says we can get reality by disbanding and joining Steiner. To M. only Steiner possesses truth. M. insisted on reason against emotionalism; also need for inspiration which S. has. (yet SR knows no−one more emotional that Meebold) SR asked if Germans were on point of discovering real tomb of CRC (as claimed by FR) − M. scorned this. SR repeated to M. tale of Steiner's being old school Ros. sent to wean Theos. back to Christianity. Prob. says M. reincarnated Ros. saw in Steiner a person with knowledge. Meebold staying with Mrs. Dalby who has sent Vigilate her resignation, this being imperative. (Insisted on by Steinerites says Per Deus to Vig.) Either Meebold exceeds his instructions or Steiner's statements to SR do not represent his rule. Question of Miss Maryan arises − but prob. not taking instructions from M.

She said it was copied by DDCF who lost his transcript, which she saw as occult intervention, but he returned and recopied it. At this time he became worse end of 1897 to Spring 1898. Heard story from Nisbet, whom she didn't like (nor his wife − both being members of Paris Temple) She liked Durand and wife. Other Paris member was Charles E. Price of 9, Charterhouse Street. Mrs. H. left Paris in 1898 being then 4=7.

Handwritten: 7 in circle, 4 in square. 2. sic: there must be a page missing, or Waite is being incredibly ironic. 3. To those not familiar with Britain's pre−1971 (non−decimal) monetary system, this is Twenty one shillings or one \"guinea\" (£1.05) − probably worth £100 − £200 ($150 − $300) in today's money (i.e. 2003). Note how the amount of money going to DDCF changes later on. 4. Photocopies not supplied. 5. Coincidentally − or even not so coincidentally! − Rostau is the name of the fifth duat of the Egyptian underworld, the location of the Library of Thoth , wherein is obtained complete knowledge . More prosaically, Rostau is the old Egyptian name for Gizeh, the site of the Great Pyramids. Perhaps \"Ros−Taw\" points to the origin of Rosicrucianism in Hermeticism or the Egyptian mysteries? 6. Sic. 7. Sic. 8. Surely this is Cerridwen, the Celtic goddess? 9. Here there is an arrow and a line drawn from \"Arsenal\" two lines above. 10. Photocopies not supplied 11. ? Perhaps he means the \"Mass of the Phoenix\", a Thelemic ritual of daily observance. 12. Sic. 13. Five Guineas − worth approx. £500 − £1000 ($750 − $1500) in 2003. 14. Three Guineas − worth approx. £300 − £600 ($450 − $900) in 2003. 15. Handwritten note − presumably by R A Gilbert. 16.

Sapiens Dominabitur Astris (\"SDA\") − Fraulein Sprengel, the apocryphal German Adept who is supposed to have originally authorised Woodman, Westcott and Mathers to found the Golden Dawn in England. Sapere Audere (\"SA\") − Dr William Wynn Westcott, one of the original chiefs of the Golden Dawn − alleged he had corresponded with Soror SDA. Gave the Cipher Mss. to Mathers to translate. Was forced to resign from the Golden Dawn in 1897 when he accidentally left Order papers in a cab. Remained active in the SRIA (referred to in Waite's diary as \"Soc.Ros.\") of which he became head in 1892 Ma Wahanu Thesi (\"MWT\") − Marcus Worsley Blackden. Sacramentum Regis (\"SR\") − i.e. Arthur Edward Waite himself. Originally a member of those who broke away from Mathers, Waite later broke away from the Stella Matutina itself to form the \"Holy Order of the Golden Dawn\". Waite Christianised the rituals of his new order, and excised the magical elements therefrom. Lucem Spero (\"LS\") − Robert Palmer Thomas. Deo Ducite Comite Ferro (\"DDCF\") − Samuel Liddell Macgregor Mathers. One of the original chiefs of the Golden Dawn − following Westcott's resignation in 1897 was the sole chief. Lived in Paris with his wife Moina where they ran the Ahathoor Temple. He claimed to have met the Secret Chiefs in person in the Bois De Boulogne. Earned ignominy by allowing himself to be duped by the Horos couple, the scandal of whose arrest and trial led to the Golden Dawn closing in 1903. Mathers' faction continued thereafter as the Alpha et Omega (AO). Sub Spe (\"SS\") − John Brodie−Innes. Prior to split with Mathers, was head of the Amen−Ra Temple in Edinburgh. Acted as a chief of the dissident Stella Matutinae, was reportedly furious with Waite for splitting off to form a non−magical GD order. Later sought rapprochement with Mathers, which led to him re−joining the AO, and being named its head on Mathers' death in 1918. Kenneth Mackenzie . Author of \"The Royal Masonic Cyclopaedia\". Was mentored by Frederick Hockley, a ritual magician. Acquainted with Eliphas Lévi, and alleged to have received continental Rosicrucian initiation from one Count Apponyi, an Austrian. Spent a lot of time founding various esoteric and quasi−masonic societies, such as the Sat Bahai, Fratres Lucis, etc. Was a member of a number of societies of which Westcott too was a member, such as the SRIA, Society of Eight, Swedenbourg Rite, etc. although he and Westcott were reported not to be particularly close. Modern scholars have speculated that it was in fact he who authored the GD Cipher Mss., Westcott getting hold of them after his death from his widow. Appendix − Dramatis Personae 44"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"R W Little − founder of the SRIA. Aleister Crowley . Originally sided with Mathers at the time of the split in the GD. Became disillusioned with Mathers over Horos scandal, finally splitting with him in 1906. Published GD rituals in his periodical \"The Equinox\" − Mathers tried and failed to obtain an injunction against it on the grounds of breach of copyright. Later, when the paper The Looking Glass defamed Crowley, his friend George Cecil Jones sued the paper for libel, claiming that he had been smeared by association. He lost. Incidentally, Crowley displayed a very low opinion of Waite in the Equinox, making Waite's comment that Crowley hadn't libelled him quite ironic. Resurgam − Dr. Edward William Berridge, member of the AO. In 1897 Mathers suspended Berridge from the GD for three months after he got into a feud with Annie Horniman. Despite this, Berridge remained loyal to Mathers. When the GD first split in 1900, Berridge opened a counter−revolutionary \"loyalist\" temple in London. Berridge testified against Jones (nb: not as Waite says against Crowley − Crowley was not a party to the action) in the Looking Glass trial by revealing salacious details about Crowley's private life. Vigilate − Mrs Helen Rand. Vestigia Nulla Retrorsum (\"Vestigia\" or \"VNR\") − Moina Mathers, neé Bergson, Macgregor Mathers' wife. Fortiter et Recte − Annie Horniman. Originally a friend of Moina, and benefactress of the Mathers in Paris. She eventually fell out with them − Mathers expelled her from the GD in 1896. She returned to the schismatic London faction in 1900 after they rebelled against Mathers. She left them after arguing with the chiefs (including Brodie−Innes and Felkin) in February 1903. Magna Est Veritas − William Woodman. With Westcott and Mathers, one of the original chiefs of the Golden Dawn. Died 1891. Christian Rosenkreuz (\"CRC\") − the mythical (legendary?) founder of the Rosicrucian Fraternity. Ex Oriente LVX (\"EOL\") − Nevill Meakin. Member of the Stella Matutina, loyal to Felkin. Meakin, who was adopted, was supposedly descended via his natural parents from Sir Mordred, the cousin of King Arthur − whence his Grandmastership of the Order of the Graal. This was known in New Zealand as the Order of the Table Round, and is supposedly the continuation of the very \"Knights of the Round Table\" of Arthurian lore. Iehi Aour − Allan Bennett. Adopted son of Macgregor Mathers. Mentor of Aleister Crowley. Left England to settle in Ceylon, to become a Buddhist monk. Rudolf Steiner . Former Goethe scholar turned Mystic, Philosopher, and innovator in the fields of education, homeopathic medicine, bio−energetic farming, and diverse other fields. Was for a time General Secretary of the German Theosophical Society, however he was increasingly at odds with Annie Bessant in style and content, until finally splitting with her over her patronage of Krishnamurti. Subsequently formed the \"Anthroposophical Society\". As candidates for \"Secret Chief\" go, Steiner is probably the least secret, as his talents were widely recognised anyway, by Ordo R−R et AC − Arthur Edward Waite Appendix − Dramatis Personae 45"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"occultists such as Dion Fortune and Julius Evola. Annie Bessant . Successor to Mme Blavatsky as leader of the Theosophical Society. C W Leadbeater . Close ally and associate of Bessant in the Theosophical Society. Found the young Krishnamurti in India by allegedly clairvoyantly seeing his aura − he and Bessant subsequently proclaimed him the \"World Teacher\" and reincarnation of Christ. Widely regarded as a paedophile with a predilection for young boys. Dr Thiessen . From Liege in Belgium. Alleged to be a Secret Chief who was in contact with Macgregor Mathers. A Martinist. Rakocsi . Presumably related to the aristocratic Hungarian family of the same name. Annie Bessant's Theosophical Society alleged that he was a Master, and the reincarnation of Christian Rosenkreuz (see above). Also known as \"The Master R.\", Dion Fortune claimed to have spoken to him astrally once: Paul Foster Case claimed to have met him in person, which in turn led to Case founding the BOTA.
