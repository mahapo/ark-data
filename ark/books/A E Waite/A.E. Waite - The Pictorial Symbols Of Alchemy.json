[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"THE PICTORIAL SYMBOLS OF ALCHEMY BY ARTHUR EDWARD WAITE THE Hermetic Mystery- upon the higher interpretation of whic h I have spoken at considerable length in the previous paper and have created an analogy between its hidden meaning and that which I should term the centre of the Religions Mystery in Christendom- is the only branch of mystic and occult literature which lent itself to the decorative sense. I suppose that there are few people compara tively who at this day have any notion of the extent to which that sense was developed in the books of the adep ts. It will be understood that in speaking now upon this subject I am leaving my proper path, but though the fact does not seem to have been registered, it is so utterly curious to note how a literature which is most dark and inscrutable of all has at the same time its lighter side- a side, indeed, of pleasant inventions, of apologue, of parable, of explicit enigma, above all of poetry. The fact is that alchemy presented itself as an art, its books were the work of artists; and for the sym-pathetic reader, even when he may understand them least, they will read sometimes like enchanting fables or legends. When in this manner some of the writers had exhausted their resources in language, th ey had recourse to illustrati ons, and I wonder almost that no one has thought to collect the amazi ng copper-plates which literally did ador n the Latin and other tracts of the seventeenth century. As I propose to print some selected specimens of the pictorial art in alchemy b ecause they are exceedingly curious, and not for a deeper reason, the reader will not exp ect, and for once in a way will perhaps be rather relieved, that I am not going in quest especially of their inner meanings. So far as may be possible, the pictures shall speak for themselves, seeing that I write for the moment rather as a lover of books- a bibliophile- than a lover of learning. I will begin, however, with a definition. The alchemists whom I have in my mind may be classified as artists on the decorative side and in their illustrations - but I know not whether they were their own draughtsmen- they approached the Rabelaisian method. The school on both sides is rather of Germanic origin; and it is such entirely, so far as the pictures are concerned. The French al chemists had recourse occasionally to de signs, but they are negligible for the present purpose. This is a clearance of the ground, but it must be added that the great and authoritative text-books have not been illustrated- as, for example, The Open Entrance to the Closed Palace o/ the King, which is the work of Eirenaeus Philalethes, and the New Light 0/ Alchemy, which is. believed to be that of. Alexander Seton. If I may attempt such a comparison, Philalethes- in the work mentioned- reads rather like a Pauline epistle and Seton like an Epistle to the Hebrews but the. analogy in both cases is intended to be allusive only, and strict in no sense. So also they read here and there as if they we re almost inspired; but they could not be termed decorative. The really practical works- as, for example, the Latin treatises ascribed to Geber- are never illustrated, except by crude sketches of material vessels used in the material art for the aid of the neophyte on his way to the transmutation of metals. I do not think that they really helped him, and they are of no account for our purpose. The pictures of the adepts were the allegorical properties of the adepts, and though the criticis m has a side of harshness th ey were almost obviously provided for the further confusion of the inquirer, under the pretence of his enlightenment. At the same time, authors or artists were sages after their own manner, their allegories had a set purpose and represent throughout a prevailing school of symbolism. It is quite easy to work out the elementary part of the symbolism; it is not difficult to speculate reasonably about some of the more obscure ma terials. But the true canons of alchemical criticism yet remain to be expounded; and I believe that I have intimated otherwise the difficulty and urgency attaching to this work, so that there may be one unerring criterion to distinguish between the texts representing the spiritual and those of the physical work. On the latter phase of the subject it w ould be useless- and more than useless- to discourse in any periodical, even if I. could claim to care anything and to know sufficiently thereof. I know neither enough to hold my tongue nor enough to speak, so that I differ in this respect- but for once only- from my . excellent precursor Elias Ashmole. Like him and like Thomas Va ughan, I do know the narrowness of the name Chemia, with the antiquity and infinity of the proper object of research; there on we have all borne true witn ess in our several days and generations. It is a matter of common report that the old Hermetic adep ts were the chemists of their time and that, as such, they made numerous and valuable discoveries. This is true in a general sense, but under what is also a general and an exceedingly grave reserve. There is little need to say in the first place, that the spiritual alchemists made no researches and could have had no findi ngs in the world of metals and minerals. Secondly, there was a great concourse of witnesses in secret literature, who were adepts of neither branch; but they expressed their dreams and speculations in terms of spurious certitude, and were often sincere in the sense that they deceived themselves. They produced sophistications in the physical work and believed that their tinctures and colorations were the work of philosophy; these discovered nothing, and misled nearly ev ery one. They also- in the alternative school- pursued erroneous ways or translated their aspirations at a distance into root-matter of spiritual Hermetic tradition; they"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"reached the term of their folly and drew others who were foolish after them , who had also no law of differentiation bet ween t hings of C aesar and God. Fi nal ly- but of these I say not hing- t here were arrant impost ors, represent ing t he colportag e of th eir tim e, wh o traffick ed in the interest of the curious, assum ing alchem y fo r their provi nce, as ot hers of t he secret sci ences were expl oited by ot hers of t heir ki ndred. Now, bet ween al l these t he offi cial histori ans of chem istry in the near past had no ground of distinction, and there is little certainty that they were right over many or most of t heir judgm ent s. Once more, the canon was want ing; as I have shown t hat in anot her regi on i t is ei ther want ing for oursel ves, or- t o be correct - is in course onl y of devel opm ent . Thi s work, t herefore, was l argel y one of divinatio n, with a p ecu liar u ncertain ty in th e resu lts. I have now finished with this intr oductory part, and I offer in the first place a sim ple illustration of the alchem ist's laborat ory , as it was concei ved by M ichael M aier at the begi nni ng of t he sevent eent h cent ury. He had a hand i n the R osicruci anism of hi s peri od and publ ished som e laws of t he brot herhood, or al ternat ively those of an incorporated so dality b ased on sim ilar lin es. He was a m an of great and excep tio nal learn ing, but with al of a fantastic spirit; he is proportionately difficult to judge, but his palm ary concern was the m aterial side of the magnum opus . He m ay h ave veered , an d did probably, in to other d irectio ns. Th e illu stratio n is chosen fro m The Golden Tri pod , bei ng t hree anci ent tract s at tribut ed respect ively to Basil Val entine, Thom as Nort on, and John C rem er- a so- cal led abbot of W estminst er. It is these personages who are apparent ly represent ed i n the pi cture, t oget her wi th the zela tor, servant or pupil, attached to the m aster of the place, whose traditional duty was the m aintenance with untiring zeal of the graduated fire of the art. Basil Valen tine, in the course of his tr act, m akes it clear that he is concerned t herei n onl y wi th the phy sical work, and in the decorat ive m anner whi ch I have m entioned he affi rm s that if the three alchem ical pri nciples- nam ely, phi losophi cal M ercury , Sul phur and Sal t- can be rect ified till \"the m etallic spirit and body are joined together inseparably by m eans of the metallic soul,\" the chain of love will he riveted firm ly thereby and the pal ace prepared for the corona tion. But the substances in question are not those whi ch are known under t hese nam es, and i t is for t his reason, or for reasons similar theret o, that no process of metallic alchem y can he followed practica lly by the isolated student, because ev erything essential is left out. The trad itio n is th at th e tru e key was im parted only fro m th e ad ept to his so n in th e art. Th is n otwith stan ding, Basil Valen tin e calls the particu lar wo rk to wh ich I am here referrin g, The Twelve Keys, and it is said th at th ey o pen th e twelve doors l eadi ng t o the St one of t he Phi losophers and to the t rue M edicine. The sam e term inol ogy woul d be used by the spi ritual alchem ists in anot her and hi gher se nse; but this school possesses a m aster-key whi ch opens al l the doors. B asil Val entine's second key is that of M ercury , as i t is pi ctured here bel ow. "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" This, it will be seen, is the crowned or philosophical Mercury, bearing in e ither hand the caduceus, which is his characteristic em blem , and having wings upon his shoulders, signify ing the volatilized state.

The latter corresponds t o that serpent whi ch, by the com mand of M oses, was upl ifted in the wilderness for the heal ing of the children of Israel. As in this fi gure Mercury has becom e a constant fire, one of the figures is shielding his face from the brilliance. He is on the side of the increasing m oon, but on the side of the sun is he who has attained the Medicine, and he looks therefore with a steadfast face upon the unveiled countenance of the vision. According to Basil Val entine, Mercury is the pri nciple of life. He say s also t hat Sat urn i s the chi ef key of t he art , though i t is least useful in the mastery .

Th ese are also from a Germ anic source, and the writer-if not the designer-was Nichol as B arnaud, who went am ong m any ot hers i n quest of R osicruci ans, but it does not appear what he found. I will give in the first place a Sym bol which represents Pu trefaction, being the disinteg ration of the rough m atter in physical alchem y and on the spiritual si de the m ystery of m ystical death. According to The Book of Lambspri ng, wh ich is th e n ame of th e little treatise, th e sag es k eep clo se guard over the secret of this operation, because the world is unw orthy; and the children of philosophy, who receive its com muni cat ion in part and carry it to the proper t erm by their personal efforts, enjoy it also in silence, since God wills that it should be hidden. This is the conquest of the dragon of m aterial and m anifest life; but it is like the old folklore fab les, in wh ich an act of violence is necessary to determ ine an enchantm ent for the redem ption of those who are enchant ed. The work i s to dest roy the body , that the body m ay not onl y be revi ved, but may live hencefort h in a more p erfect an d as if in corru ptib le fo rm . Th e th esis is th at Natu re is retu rned unto herself with a h igher g ift and m ore sacred warrant and the analogy am ong things fam iliar is the sanctifica tion of intercourse by the sacram ent of marriage.

The next illustration concerns the natural union betw een body soul and spirit; it is re presented pictorially in the tract after more than one m anner, as when two fishes are s hown swim ming in th e sea, an d it is said th at th e sea is th e body . Here it is a st ag and an uni corn, whi le the body is that forest whi ch t hey range.
