THE IMercurius or Hermes Trismegistus of legend was a personage, an Egyptian sage or succession of sages, who, since the time of Plato, has been identified with the Thoth (the name of the month September) of that people. This Thoth is the reputed author of the \"Kitual of the Dead,\" or, as styled in Egyptian phraseology, the \"Manifes- tation of Light\" to the Soul, who through it declared the will of the Gods and the mysterious nature of Divine things to Man. 1 Dr Pietschmann, in his work on Hermes, which exhaustively treats of this subject, 2 gives a list of authorities for these facts, ranging from Plato down to Syncellus, circa A.D. 790. He states, however (p. 33), that by the time that the so-called Hermeneutical writings were collected together, the identity of Hermes with Thoth was forgotten, and Thoth became his son Tat, and Asclepius his disciple, both of whom he instructs in the writings now translated. Subsequently Pietschmann informs us, quot- ing Letronne, 3 that the epithet \" Trismegistus \" appears first in the second century of the Christian era, and that, before that period, Hermes was designated by the repeti- A 1 tion of the \" peyas, ft'eyas, neya; \" only, as on the Eosetta Stone. He was considered to be the impersonation of the reli- gion, art, learning, and sacerdotal discipline of the Egyptian priesthood.

In the Hiero- glyphics he, like Horus, is represented by a bird with a hawk's head, and to him was sacred the Ibis and the Moon. 2 f This Hermes and there was but one among the ancient I Egyptians 3 was worshipped as a god by them. Terfcul- lian 4 says, \" In ancient times most authors were supposed to be, I will not say god-like, but actually gods ; as, for instance, the Egyptian Hermes, to whom Plato paid very great deference.\" / Clement of Alexandria 5 writes, \" Hermes of Thebes and Esculapius of Memphis ex vate Deus ; \" and he subse- quently gives a detailed account of his works, forty-two in number four of astrology, others of astronomy, geology, and hieroglyphics, and thirty -six of philosophy, hymns to God, religious ceremonies, and sacerdotal discipline. 6 Lactantius 7 expresses himself thus (quoting Cicero, \"De Natura Deorum,\" Lib. iii.) : \" Although a man, he was of great antiquity, and built Hermopolis, and is there wor- shipped as well as at Pheneus. He was most fully imbued with every kind of learning, so that the knowledge of many subjects and arts acquired for him the name of ' 1 See the edition of the works of Hermes by Frangois de Foix, Comte de Candalle, assisted by the younger Scaliger. 2 Champollion the younger (\" Pantheon Egyptien\").

Augustine 1 relates, \"He, the fifth Mercury (as Lactantius had thought also), and his friend Esculapius (or Asclepius, grandson of the first) were men, and became gods, Mercurius and ^Esculapius, after the Greek fashion.\" Cyril of Alexandria (\" Contr. Julian.,\" i. 30a, circa 412), speaks of Hermes in general thus: \" This Hermes then, him of Egypt, although being initia- tor (reXsffrfo), and having presided at the fanes of idols, is always found mindful of the things of Moses, l&c.; and made mention of him in his own writings, which, being composed for the Athenians, are called ' Hermaica,' fifteen books.\" And subsequently, \" I speak of Hermes, him having sojourned, third, in Egypt \" (Lib. v., 1762>). 2 The majority of the Fathers, in their uncritical mode, j even Lactantius himself, confounded the original Hermes with our author, in the same way that they ascribed to the Sybilline verses a far too high antiquity;, and the later Fathers, moreover, especially Lactantius, made no distinc- tion between the genuine works of our Hermes and others which falsely bear his name; some of them, as, for in-* stance, \" Asclepius,\" having been written at least a century later ; and those, as, for instance, \" The Sacred Book \" and the Dialogue between Isis and Horus (Stobseus, \" Physica,' 928, 1070, edit. Meineke, i. 281, 342), to which it is impos- sible to assign a date, are all indiscriminately ascribed to the same Hermes, although it is absolutely certain that the author of \" Poemandres \" never can have written them. What is strange is, that several of the learned editors of the works of our Hermes consider him to have lived before Moses. Vergicius, in his preface to the edition printed at Paris by Turnebus in 1554, states this. Flussas (1574), after discussion, leaves the question as to his age undeter- mined; but Patricius (Patrizzi), in his \"Nova de Universis Philosophia,\" printed at Ferrara in 1591, and at Venice 1 \" City of God,\" viii. 23, 26. 2 See the extracts from Cyril of Alexandria, post, Part III., and the note from Pietschmann there. I"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"x PREFACE. 1593, says that Hermes lived some time before Moses, and quotes Eusebius in his \" Chronicle \" as stating that Cath or Tat his son flourished in the first year of Armeus, king of Egypt, which was twenty years before the death of Moses. On the other hand, John Albert Fabricius, the learned author of the \" Bibliotheca Grseca \" (published 1705-1728), has relegated all the \" Hermaica,\" in his \" Historia Literaria,\" to the later times of Jamblichus and r Porphyry. Even Pietschmann, whose dissertation has ^ been already mentioned, makes no distinction between ( the legendary Hermes and the author of \" Poemandres.\" Notwithstanding these opinions, it is certain that the Hermes who was the author of the works here translated must, as Causabon and later writers (such as L. Menard, who thinks he was probably contemporaneous with St. John) have shown, have been a Greek living at Alexandria, subsequently to Philo Judseus and Josephus, in the end of the first and beginning of the second century; who, it would seem, assumed the name of Hermes in order to give greater weight to his teaching. The Fathers above quoted, Lactantius himself, and the editors of Hermes above named, may have been misled as to his great antiquity by the hieroglyphical representations of him; but the facts, then unknown, but now demonstrated, that the use of these characters lasted in Egypt down to the tenth year of Diocletian (he died A.D. 313) at the least, and that, as Henry Brugsch and later investigators have shown, the ordinary writing on papyrus in the National Library at Paris, some of which is entirely in Greek characters, is not earlier than the times of Nero, refute their supposi- I tions. It is, moreover, quite impossible that an author who shows an intimate acquaintance with the phraseology of Plato, with the Hebrew Scriptures as extant in the Septuagint version (sometimes using the very expressions therein contained), who reproduces the language of the Sermon on the Mount and of the Gospel, Epistles, and Eevelation of St. John, and sometimes of St. Paul, can have flourished at so early a period."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"PREFACE. xi These same facts serve also to indicate his actual epoch. Although, as De Eouge 1 has shown, very early Egyptian monuments now at Berlin and elsewhere express or insinuate the idea of the Eternal Father- Creator, and of his Son begotten before the worlds, yet the dogma of the Holy Trinity is, as we shall find, expressed in far more categorical terms, and almost in the very words of St. John, by our Hermes in his \" Poem- andres;\" so also the doctrine of Baptism and the Begenera- tion or new birth, as set forth by St. John in the third chapter of his Gospel, as due to The Man, the only Son of God. Asclepius was said to be the grandson of Hermes, and the work which bears that name refers unmistakably to times near to those of Constantine, when the ancient reli- gion of Egypt was tottering to its fall. Moreover, that author refers therein repeatedly to Ammonius Saccas, who is called the founder of the Xeoplatonic School,, and who died circa A.D. 241. On the other hand, the clear refer- ence, by Justin Martyr, to the teaching of Hermes as to the Unity of the Godhead, 2 and the identity, almost verbal, of a passage in that Father with a passage in the \" Poern- andres,\" and the mention of him by Tertullian, demonstrate that he wrote before or contemporaneously with the earlier of these Fathers. Many of the works of our Hermes are probably still entombed in the libraries on the Continent; but those which have come to light, and are now trans- lated, are most remarkable and of very considerable im- portance, since they are the only treatises we possess of the kind belonging to that epoch. The emphatic praise bestowed upon them by the Fathers, from Justin Martyr 3 downwards, ought to commend them to our notice.

The former editors of Hermes were of like opinion. Thus Vergicius, in his preface to the edition of Turnebus (Paris, 1554), \" His teaching appears to be most excellent and evangelical.\" \" Behold in his theology how wonder- fully and evangelically he hath plainly instructed us as to the Most Holy Trinity.\" So also Flussas, with Scaliger the younger (Bordeaux, 1574), \"He deserves the name of an evangelical philosopher, for he first expounded the chief effects of divine grace upon man, and first declared how his salvation depended upon the Son of God the one Man given for the regeneration of mankind.\" So Patricius also, in his \"Nova de Universis Philosophia\" (Ferrara, 1591; Venice, 1593), which comprised the principal works of Hermes, speaks thus, \" In these books and fragments of Hermes will appear a philosophy pious towards God and, in most respects, consonant to the dogmas of faith. It will appear also that all the Greek philosophies, Pytha- gorean and Platonic in divine things and the dogmas of morals, those of Aristotle and of the Stoics in physics and medicine, were all taken from these his books and from those which have perished.\" But although this may be so, the reader must be forewarned that he will not find in these writings a complete Christianity. There is no express notice of the Nativity, of the Crucifixion, Eesurrection, or Ascension, or coming of Christ to Judgment, to be found therein, although there is also nothing inconsistent^ with 1 \" Contra.

On the other hand, as has been already seen, they teach emphatically the Unity of the Godhead, the dogma of the Holy Trinity God the Father, the Word, the Son begotten of Him before the worlds, of the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father through the Son, in- strumental in creation, and the Sanctifier; and there are clear allusions to the effusion of this Holy Spirit on the World, with its Seven Gifts in the shape of Fire. Thus Hermes was not a mere Platonist propounding ] the means of attaining moral and intellectual perfection without reference to the facts and doctrines of Holy ; Scripture, but, in theory at least, in great part a Christian. The \"Hermaica\" have been unaccountably neglected in England. That these works were not unknown here in the time of Milton is proved by his words from \"II Penseroso,\" \"With thrice-great Hermes:\" but they received little further attention in this country. On the Continent, however, as soon as the originals of his principal treatises was dis- covered, the value of them was perceived, and immediately after the invention of printing they were committed to the press. The \" Poemandres,\" the principal work, was translated into Latin and published by Marsilius Ficinus at Treviso in 1471, divided into fourteen chapters, which were after- wards increased to twenty by Patricius. This edition of Ficinus was several times republished; at Ferrara and Venice in 1472 ; at Mayence in 1503 ; and especially at Cracow, but in a Latin translation only, by the Carmelite Eosselli, in six volumes folio, in 1584, with a commentary so voluminous, discursive, and argumentative that it is nearly useless. Nevertheless, this was reprinted, with what professed to be the original Greek, at Cologne, in 1638, in one volume folio. The original Greek of the ; \" Poemandres,\" and of the \" Definitions of Asclepius to Ammon the King\" (which, we shall see presently, is not a work of our author, but subsequent to his epoch), were first printed and published by Adr. Turnebus, edited, with"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"xiv PREFACE. a preface, by Angelus Vergicius, at Paris, in quarto, in 1554. D. Franciscus Flussas republished the \"Poem- andres\" in Greek and Latin, in quarto, at Bordeaux in 1574. Francis Patricius (Cardinal Patrizzi) reprinted the works attributed to Hermes which are extant in Greek (some of which, as already stated, we shall find are not his) among his \" Nova de Universis Philosophia \" at Fer- rara, in folio, in 1591; and again under a new title, \"Nova de Universis Philosophia libris quinquaginta comprehensa, auctore Francisco Patritio,\" at Venice, in folio, in 1593, Eobertus Meiettus being the printer. Gustave Parthey has done a great service to early Christian literature by publishing at Berlin, in 1854, an entirely new edition of the \"Poemandres\" in the original Greek, from a MS. of the end of the 13th century, No. 1220 in the National Library at Paris ; others, Nos. 1297, 2007, 2518, of the 16th century, in the same library having, with 1220, been collated by D. Hamm with the edition of Turnebus and that numbered 2518, which had been written by the hand of Angelus Vergicius at Venice. Parthey also consulted another MS. of the 14th century, Plut. Ixxi., No. 33, in quarto, in the Laurentian library at Florence, collated, at the request of Parthey, by Francis de Furia with the Turnebus edition. This publication of G. Parthey is most carefully edited, and accompanied by a close and admirable Latin translation of his own. In the preface he promised an edition of the other remains of Hermes to be found extracted in Stobseus and several of the Fathers, which promise, it is to be lamented, he has not yet performed. There exist several old French translations of the \"Her- maica:\" one by G. de Preau, published at Paris in 1557; \" Two books of Hermes Trismegistus, one ' Of the Power and Wisdom of God,' the other 'Of the Will of God;'\" another of the \" Poemander,\" by Foye de Candalle, with a comment, at Bordeaux, 1574; another, by G.

This translation is by no means literal, often an abbreviation, and sometimes incorrect. It is prefaced by a critical dissertation on the authorship and contents of the Hermetic books respectively, which contains much curious information. This work was crowned by the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles Lettres, but is dis- cursive and not sufficiently discriminative. Nevertheless the conclusions of the writer have often been adopted as correct in the present volume. In 1781 Dietrich Tiedemann, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Marbourg, the author of several works on the philosophies of the Greeks and Egyptians, published at Berlin and Stettin a translation into German of the Poemandres, or Treatise by the Hermes Trismegistus of \" God's Might and Wisdom.\" In 1875, as already stated, Engelmann at Leipsic pub- lished a dissertation on Hermes Trismegistus by Dr Eichard Pietschmann, \"after Egyptian, Greek, and Oriental sources,\" which, however, relates mostly to the legendary Hermes, and not to our author, but which contains a mine of infor- mation on the general subject from a vast variety of authorities, and may be considered introductory to the present volume. At Bologna, 1820, was printed a dissertation on the Hermaica, of which, however, the translator has not been able to obtain a copy. Some others are referred to by Me*nard in the preface to his volume. At 1855-1860 were published at Leipsic the complete works of Stobasus in six volumes, correctly edited by Augustus Meineke as part of the \" Bibliotheca Scriptorum Gra3corum et Komanorum Teubneriana,\" which, in his \" Physica et Ethica et Florilegium,\" contain large Excerpts from Hermes. These constitute almost all we have of his genuine works, beyond the \"Poemandres,\" which we possess entire, and the notices we have of them in the Fathers of the Church."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"xvi PREFACE. The genuine works of our Hermes now extant and here translated, and presumably belonging to the latter part of the first century and beginning of the second, are 1. The \" Poemandres,\" of which he is by common con- sent the author, which consists mostly of dialogues after the manner of Plato. The first alone bears that name, being a colloquy between that personage who represents \"NoDg,\" or \"Mind\" the Wisdom and Power and Providence of God, Life, and Light with Hermes himself. The eleventh chapter also contains a dialogue of a similar character. In the remainder Hermes instructs his son Tat and his dis- ciple and grandson Asclepius, and in part mankind gene- rally, in the wonderful Knowledge of God and of the Crea- tion and of Piety, which he had learned from Nofe. 2. Several portions of the books of Hermes and his son Tat, for which we are mainly indebted to the excerpts made by Stobseus in his \"Physica,\" \"Ethica,\" and the \" Florilegium.\" Also fragments of the first book of the \"Digressions to Tat,\" which are quoted in the works of Cyril of Alexandria against Julian ; and some portions of the books of Hermes to the earlier Ammon, which are extracted from that work by Stobaeus in his \" Physica,\" with a few sentences quoted by Lactantius which are not to be found elsewhere. The citations from Hermes con- tained in the Christian Fathers will be found in Part III. Other discourses commonly called \" Hermaica,\" but which are not his, because containing statements and doctrines which are inconsistent with his, and are either of Egyptian and heathenish origin, or savour of the later teaching of Plotinus and Jamblichus, and besides contain evident anachronisms, are therefore not included in this volume, although we find there plagiarisms from the original Hermes and many statements accordant with Christianity. These are : 1. The \"Perfect Discourse\" (\\dyoc, reXziog), which bears the title of Asclepius. The author speaks of Hermes as \"my grandfather,\" and calls Ammon into council pre- sumably that Ammonius Saccas who was the master of"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"PREFACE. xvii Plotinus, and died in Alexandria A.D. 241. Of this, except such of the extracts in Stobaeus and Lactantius as are in Greek, there is only one version extant a Latin transla- tion falsely ascribed to Apuleius (which existed also solely in the time of St Augustine, who cites it in chs. 23 and 26 of Lib. viii. of his \"City of God \"), and which was published with his works by Aldus in 1521, and Almenhorst at Frankfort in 1621. That this is not from the hand of our Hermes is at once apparent from its contents, which are at variance with his genuine writings. It contains, amongst other things, an eloquent address to the Nile, wherein the author, as a prophet, laments in touching terms the abolition of the ancient national religion of Egypt that holy land and the approaching triumph of Christianity; the devastation of the country and of its sacred shrines, and destruction of the population. He speaks of Isis and Osiris, and of the cult of animals, of Jupiter Plutonius, of thirty 1 - six horoscopes, and of the Pantomorphosis. Further, it contains a distinct defence of the worship of statues of the gods formed by the hands of men, and maintains that it is a great privilege granted by God to men the power of making gods. That Lac- tantius quotes this work more than once as of Hermes himself, and applies his description of the calamities of Egypt as if they were the afflictions to come upon the earth in the last days, 1 is simply a proof of the uncritical judgment of some of the Fathers as to chronology, and sometimes as to exact authorship, which is well known and acknowledged. It is plainly the production of an Alexandrian of the Egyptian religion, who assumed the name and discipleship of, and quoted from, Hermes for his own purposes, and most probably lived some short time before the epoch of Constantine. A second discourse, also found among the \"Hermaica,\" is a portion of that called the \" Sacred Book,\" denominated Ko>j XOO/AOU (Patrit, 276, Stobseus, \" Physica,\" Meineke, L 281), which Patrizzi corrected after Stobseus from a MS. 1 Lactant., Divin. Instit., VII., 18."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"xviii PREFACE. found at Enclistra, in the island of Cyprus. It is a strange production, being a dialogue between Isis and his son Horus, with Momus, on the creation of the world and of f souls, and of metempsychosis. It is in places Platonic, as \\ if citing the Timreus; and it quotes also by name Hermes, and partly the account by him of the Creation in \" Poem- andres.\" Being apparently a summary of the Grseco- Egyptian philosophy, it must be attributed to a Graeco- Egyptian, probably of Alexandria; but it is scarcely Greek at all, and there are few indications of its exact date. In this production Hermes is spoken of in these words : \" Hermes, he understanding all things, who also saw the whole of things together, and having seen, considered them, and having considered them was powerful to explain and show them. For what he understood he committed to characters, and having committed them to characters, con- cealed the most part, being silent with wisdom, and speak- ing opportunely, in order that all the duration of the world hereafter should search out these things; and thus having ordered the gods, his brethren, to become his escort, he ascended towards the constellations. But he had for suc- cessor Tat, his son and heir of his science, and shortly after- wards Asclepius, son of Imothes, by the counsel of Pan and Haephsestus, and all those to whom the Almighty Provi- dence reserved an exact knowledge of the things of heaven. Hermes then excused himself to all his sur- roundings for not delivering the entire theory to his sdn, on account of his youth.\" From this it would appear that the writer of this discourse was posterior to Asclepius, that is, of the middle or end of the third century. A third fragment of importance is usually included among the \" Hermaica,\" and is quoted by Lactantius with a like \\ want of critical sagacity. It is denominated the \" Defini- tions (\"Opoi) of Asclepius to King Ammon.\" He calls \" Hermes my master, who conversed with me often alone or in presence of Tat,\" and quotes many passages of the \" Poemandres.\" It is written with eloquence.

The whole is alien from the spirit and diction of Hermes himself, and must have been composed many years sub- sequently to the \" Poemandres.\" The theological and philosophical teaching of our Hermes for he was both a theologian and philosopher, may be thus summed up : First and foremost he insists upon the being of The God; an Unconditioned, self-existent Essence, Founder (xrfoag), Maker (vrotqrrii), Creator (dq/uiovpybs), upholder and governor of the Universe at His own mere Will, the One, the Only, the Supreme very Life and Light Itself. He is Almighty (Mevriis), never inert, but ever acting in every part of His creation, pervading and energizing all things by His particular Providence, to which Fate and Necessity are wholly subject. Nothing can subsist or move apart from Him, Who has in Himself all things that have been, are. or shall be. He is the perfection and the sum of The Good, the Beautiful, the Holy, and the True; immaterial, infinite, incorporeal, invisible, the object of none of the senses; ineffable, incomprehensible, inimitable, invariable; without form or figure, colourless; Intelligence and Wisdom itself; everlasting, independent of time, the Eternal from eternity; the Light and Life of mankind; Holiness and Goodness itself, and in no sense the author of anything evil or base. If any evil exist in creation, it is as it were by way of rust or excrescence only, and cannot be attributed to the Deity. This Being, above all, in all, and about all, is Unity. The universal Harmony of the KoV/Aos, which is eloquently set forth, demonstrates that He can be but One. Motion exists throughout all the order of the worlds, and is the condition and quality of the Eternal; but this Motion must be generated and continually energized by some Being superior to and stronger than that which is moved, and than the medium in which the motion takes place.

A name implies an elder or superior to give the name; but there is none such. We call Him Father and Master and Lord of all existences, not as names, but appellations derived from His benefits and His works. This, The God before the moist Nature which appeared out of darkness, begat the Perfect Word, coessential (' Opoouff/bi) with Himself, the Second God, visible and sensible, First One and only, and loved Him as His own Son a sacred, ineffable, and shining Word, exceeding all the ability of men to declare Son of God The One Man by the Will of God, through Whom is access in prayer to The Father, The Lord of all things. Through this Word were the World, the Heaven, the Stars, the Earth, Mankind, and all the living existences in them, brought into being, and harmoniously ordered through the operation of Mind (\"NoDj\"), the Wisdom of God, the God of Fire and Spirit proceeding from God, Which with the Seven administrative Spirits created by it, whose administration constitutes Fate, applied themselves to the conformation of the Universe out of chaos, according to the Idea, the Archetype or Pattern, pre-existent in the Mind of the Deity. This \"Kotos'\" so created, Hermes calls second God, as being wholly instinct with The One Divinity. He gives the same appellation to the Sun, for the same reason and because it is the instrument of God's Will in new creating. The mode of the creation is shown in the form of a Vision displayed before Hermes, and in several portions is related in the very words of the Septuagint version of Genesis. The Procession of the Holy Spirit and His instrumentality in Creation is enun- ciated, apparently according to the creed of the orthodox Greeks. Thus, The God created Man after the image of Himself, as His child, an immortal and divine animal, out of two natures, the immortal and mortal, between the two, that viewing all things he may admire them and then- wonderful order and harmony.

It is threefold Mind or Eeason, Desire, and Spirit, which can receive God, and become a consort of Deity, having intellect and speech immortal pro- perties, that Man may contemplate and worship his Creator. The greatest disease of the Soul is ungodliness and ignorance of God. Man, being an imperfect, fallible, and composite being, cannot know The God of himself; but those to whom The God of His own free will imparts this faculty can do so. He is ever desirous and willing to be known; and to those who are pure, and who wish for this knowledge, He reveals Himself by imparting to them of His Mind, which is of the very essence of the Divinity, and joined to it as the light is to the Sun. Not that Mind is God; but that The God is the cause of Mind. This Mind in men is God. Such men therefore have their humanity near to Deity, for He is their very Father; when they leave the body, they become this Mind. They must seek the knowledge of Him, which is virtue, temperance, piety, salvation, and ascent to Heaven. The God created all things perfect. Man has become depraved; but has free choice of good and evil. To attain this state, then, men must hate and mortify the flesh, its vices and excesses, reject the depravity and ignorance of earth, where Truth does not exist; the wickedness, darkness, and corruption of the body; they must recur and look in heart to Him, Who can alone show the way of salvation. The mode of accomplishing this, which can only be done by the help of God, Who is willing to reveal Himself to all, is by ridding themselves of the twelve principal vices, and acquiring in their place the ten cardinal virtues. When these shall be so acquired, man becomes fitted to ascend to the Ogdoad, the eighth Circle, to the presence of God his Father, to become immortal, part of His Essence"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"xxii PREFACE. and of His Powers and Virtues, and divine (&%/). This may happen even in the body, by the gift of God. This is the Eegeneration (fl-aX/yyewstf/a). The author of it is the enlightening Word of God the One Man by the will of God. Baptism is to be added, and His good Spirit must lead men thereto: those thus regenerate will strive to bring all mankind to the same blessed state. Neither any evil, nor has Fate, any power over those who are thus pious and regenerate. They are rewarded with immortality both of soul and body, becoming partakers of Divinity, having attained The Supreme Good. In death the union of soul and body is dissolved, but the Soul survives. There can be no destruction of what is of God and in God. From the perishing body (which is not a destruction, but a dissolution of the union in order to be renovated) a new body arises, and becomes immortal through the immortal Soul. This cannot wholly be attained in the present life; but, after death, the Man, becoming entirely in harmony with God, employs himself beyond the eighth or perfect zone in hymns of happine&lv,. and praise. Those who adhere to the body, and surrender themselves to its passions, are abandoned by God; they attain not unto The Good, or to immortality, but becoming more and more wicked they are given over for vengeance to the evil demon, tormented by wicked demons and fire; retrograding to reptilism, they are given over to be tormented by evil passions and lusts, and, condemned to misery, are whirled about the universe are converted into devils. No allusion is however made by Hermes to the Egyptian judgment by Osiris, or to that by Christ taught in the New Testa- ment. Finally, the great end of Man is, when thus purified and regenerated, to worship His Creator in His presence, and to be united to Him, and to contemplate and adore Him in holy Silence.

Thus does Hermes inculcate or imply several of the main doctrines and objects of Christianity; but it is fair to admit that, as before observed, he does not notice the fact of the Nativity upon earth, or the Crucifixion, Death, Eesurrection, or Ascension of Christ, or His Coming to Judgment. Perhaps they did not come within the purview of his intention, as neither within that of Paley in his \" Natural Theology.\" The astronomical teaching of Hermes is merely inci- dental to the rest, and is simple enough. The whole Universe is in the form of a sphere. Nature is composed of four Elements Earth, Air, Fire, and Water. He appears also to have inferred the rotundity of the Earth fr^-. j that of the Sun, Moon, and Planets the latter perhaps revolving round the Sun, but the whole cosmical system round the Earth in an organized Harmony of one external, of seven inner, circles; the varying motion of the Planets being accounted for by a resisting medium. He was aware of the difference between the revolutions of Venus and Mercury and those of the other planets, but does not account for it. He asserts plainly enough that the Earth itself is stable and immoveable ; the Constellations, especi- ally the Zodiac, fixed in a solid Firmament, circulating round the Earth also, diagonally to the Equatorial Circle and the orbits of the planets, with the Polar Star for a central pivot, drawn round it by the COL stellation of the Bear. The whole system of this KoV^oj, or Universe, and of the Harmony thereof, is mainly the same as that of Plato. It is remarkable that Hermes anticipates modern philosophy by insisting that there is no void in nature, and"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"xxiv PREFACE. that none of the works of The God can become extinct or perish, but, if disappearing, are resolved into some other essence or nature, and renovated in another form; thus, it would appear, affirming the future eternity of existing matter, and deducing from this the immortality of the human body. His reasoning resembles that of S. Paul, 1 Cor. xv. 36 : \" Thou foolish one, that which thou thyself so west is not quickened except it die,\" &c. It is, of course, impossible in this volume to contrast the theology and philosophy of our Hermes, with that of Philo Judseus, with which it has many points of resemblance, or with that of the Grecian sages generally; but in the notes several extracts have been given from the Dialogues of Plato (as edited by C. F. Hermann, at Leipsic, in 1877) and from other authors illustrative of the text. Many passages of Holy Scripture from the Septuagint and the Eevised Version of the New Testament have likewise been noted with the same view. Finally, it is desirable to state that the language and style of our Hermes is semi-classical, though Alexandrian, and without dialect; but often rugged, involved, mystical, tauto- logical, and obscure, with a number of technical words belonging to the Greek philosophy which renders it difficult to translate. It bears much resemblance to that of Plato, whose writings he had certainly studied. The aim of the translator has not been to produce a flowing version, or an elegant paraphrase, or a pithy abbreviation, but to render the original into English with as much literal exactness as practicable."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"UNIVERSITY HERMES TRISMEGISTUS.

Compare Rom. i. 20 : \" For the invisible things of Him, since the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being perceived through the things that are made, His everlasting Power and Divinity;\" and Heb. ix. 23, \" It was necessary that the copies of things in the Heavens should be purified with these \" (scil. by sacrifices). 3 Compare John i. 4, \" In Him was Life, and the Life was the Light of the Men.\" 4 This paragraph seems to relate that the God of Fire and Spirit pro ceeds, according to the creed of the orthodox Greek Church, from the Father through the Son.

The health of the body is injured by sloth, restored by exercise ; the health of the soul is improved and preserved by learning and care being motions, and acquires knowledge. By inactivity, carelessness, and v want of instruction it learns nothing, and forgets what it may have / learnt. Motion, then, is good both for soul and body ; and Homer teaches that so long as there be the circulation in movement and the sun, all things are, and are preserved with gods and men.

Josephus mentions that Berosus attributed to Abraham great knowledge of astrology, in which he instructed the Egyptians. Diodorus speaks of Heliadss (Easterns), who were great astrologers. One of them built Hieropolis, and the Egyptians became great astrologers, and were looked upon as its inventors, and, accord- ing to A. Tatius, the Egyptians taught it to the Chaldaeans. In the dialogue between Hermes and Asclepius (perhaps not a genuine work of Hermes himself), in answer to a question of Asclepius, Hermes is j represented as affirming that the stellar Angels, called Decans, have J very great influence over men.

That there might be some measure of their relative swiftness in their eight courses, God kindled Light in the second of the orbits, that next the earth, which we call Sun, especially that it might shine over all the heaven, and that living creatures, such to whom it was suitable, might partake of number, learning it from the orbit of this and the like. Thus then became Night and Day, and the period of the one and most intellectual revolution,\" &c. \" There is no difficulty in seeing that the perfect number of Time completes the perfect year, when all the eight periods having their relative degrees of swiftness are accom- plished together, and begin again at their original points of departure.\" See ante, sec. 2, note 2. 1 The Seven Stars, with their guardian angels (viz., the Sun, the Moon, Venus, Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn), were by Hermes believed to revolve round the Earth, which remained unmoved in the midst.

These things then not existing in His Essence, what remains beside but The Good only? for as none of the evil things in such an Essence, so in none of the others will the Good be found. For in all, things are otherwise, both in the small and in the great, and in those individually, and in this the animal the greater and most powerful of all.

As I said, to talk of the spherical as having one part above and another below, is not wise.\" 1 Referring to the \"Ideas\" or \" Forms n which Plato held to be the originals of all things, Plutarch defined the \" Idea\" thus (quoted byStobaeuSjPhysica, ch. xii. 6a; Meineke,i. 87) : \"Idea is Incorporeal Essence, cause of such like beings as itself is, and pattern (^xpec^siy^oc) of the subsistence (tmordtfffas) of the objects of sense (afofaray) having themselves (s^ovrav) according to nature ; it indeed sustained of itself, and imaging (evmcovi^ovyet) shapeless materials, an,d becoming cause of the arrangement QiaTei%eas) of these, applying order of a father to , the objects of sense.\" Plato, in \" Parmenides,\" says: \" It appears to me that the matter stands thus : that these Forms (l/S>j) stand in the Nature as if patterns, and that other things resemble these, and are likenesses, and the participation of the Forms with the others, becomes nothing else than the being assimilated to them.\" 2 This simile of the cave is borrowed from Plato's Republic, lib. v. 28, 517, et seq.; Hermann, iv. 202. 3 Parthey suggests \" confusion/' p. 38. 4 Referring to the return of each to its own place in the heavens.

But the third animal, The Man, generated after the image of the World, but having Mind, according to the will of the Father beyond other earthly animals, not only has sympathy with the second God, but also intelligence (c) of the first ; for of the one it is sensible as of body, but of the other it receives intelligence as of an incorporeal and of the Good Mind (d).

For in the other animals the sense is united to the nature, but in men understanding (d). But) Mind differs from understanding as much as The God from_/ Divinity (e). For the Divinity indeed is generate by(/) God, but understanding by the Mind, being sister of the speech and organs of each other. For neither is the speech uttered apart (y) from understanding, nor is the under- standing shown without speech. 2. The Sense then and the Understanding, both to- gether, have influence (h) upon the Man, as it were, con- , nected with each other. For neither apart from Sense is it possible to understand, 1 nor to have sensation apart from understanding. But it is possible to understand Understanding (i) apart from Sense, as those fancying (k) visions in their dreams ; but it seems to me that both the energies are generated in the vision of the dreams, and that the sense is aroused to wakefulness out of sleep. For the Man has been divided both into the body and into the Soul, and when both the parts of the Sense shall concord one with another, then that the understanding is spoken out and brought forth (I) by the Mind. 3. For the Mind conceives all the thoughts (in) ; good indeed when it shall have received the seeds from The God, but the contrary when from any of the demons ; no (a) I/TUXJJ. (ft) ovataion;.

For the seeds of The God are few, but great and both beautiful and good: Virtue, and Temperance, and Piety. But Piety is Knowledge of God, 3 which he who recogniseth (fr), becoming full of all the good things, pos- sesses (c) the divine thoughts, and not like the many. Because of this, those being in knowledge, neither please the many, nor the many them ; they seem to be mad, and occasion laughter, and being hated and despised, and per- haps also murdered. For we have said that wickedness (d) must dwell here, being in its own region ; for its region is the earth (e), not the World (/) as some may say blas- pheming. But the Godfearing man will contemn all things, perceiving the Knowledge. For all things to such an one, although to others the evil, are good ; and taking counsel he refers all things unto the Knowledge, and what is wonderful, alone renders the evils good (#). 4 5.

For the one along with wickedness (material, as I said), from the demons possesses (a) the seed of the understand- ing ; but these along with the essentially good are saved by The God. For The God is the Creator of all things ; creating all things He makes all things like to Himself; but these good things generated, in the use of energy are barren : for the worldly course rubbing against (b) these generations (c), makes them qualities, soiling these indeed with the evilness, but purifying those with the Good. For the World also, O Asclepius! has its proper sense and understanding, not like to the human nor as various, but as superior and simpler. 6. For the sense and understanding of the World is one, in the making all things, and unmaking them into itself, organ of the will of The God; and so organised, that, having received all the seeds unto itself from The God, conserving them in itself, it might manifestly (d) make all things, and dissolving might renew all things ; and when thus dissolved, as a good agriculturist of life it imparts by the change a renewal to these its offspring (e). There is nothing that it does not engender alive (/). But bearing it makes all things alive, and it is at once the place and the creator of life. 7. But the bodies from matter are in difference. For some indeed are from earth, some from water, some from air, and some from fire ; but all are composite (#), and some are more so, some more simple ; more so indeed are the heavier, the lighter less so. But the velocity (A) of its course effects the variety of the generations of qualities (j).

The same then should be called \"World\" both necessarily and fittingly.

The Mind, O Tat ! is of the very essence of The God; if indeed there is any essence of God, and of what quality this may be He alone hath accurately known. The Mind then is not cut off from the Essentiality of The Godhead (a) but united, just as the light of the Sun. But this the Mind in men indeed is God. Wherefore also some of men are Gods, 2 and their humanity is nigh to the Deity. For also the Good Demon hath called the Gods immortal men, but the men mortal Gods. But in irrational animals the Mind is the nature. 2. For where Soul, there also is Mind, as where life there also is Soul. But in the irrational animals the soul is life, void of the Mind; for the Mind is benefactor of the souls of men, for it works on them (b) to their proper good; and in the irrational indeed it co-operates with the nature of each, but it practises against (c) those of the men. For every Soul generate in body is forthwith depraved, both by (a) ovviorqros 6fvr-ffrog. (6) epyoi^Ton eivroc;.

The whole chapter is a metaphysical amplification of the Divine truth so energetically set forth (amongst others) by Malebranche in his Reclwrche, de la VeritS, and Traite de la Morale. \" For in Him we live, and move, and have our being \" (Acts xvii. 28). \"And in Him all things consist\" (Col. L 17). \" Upholding all things by the Word of His power\" (Heb. i. 3). See ante, ch. x. 4, note 1 ; , and hereafter sec. 14, for what is meant by the Good Demon. 2 \" I have said ye are Gods \" (Ps. Ixxxii. 6). \" Partakers of the Divine nature \" (2 Peter i. 4). \" Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are Gods?

For of the composite body both the grief and the pleasure seethe (a), just as humours, into which the Soul having entered is immerged (&). 3. In whatsoever souls then the Mind presides to these it shows its own light, practising against their proclivi- ties (c) ; just as a good physician pains the body pre-occupied fay disease, burning or cutting for the sake of health. In the same way also the Mind pains the Soul, extricating it from pleasure, by which every disease of Soul is generate. A great disease of the Soul is Atheism (c), since thereupon follows opinion (e\\ unto all things that are evil and nothing good. Thus then the Mind counteracting this, procures the Good for the Soul, as also the physician the health for the body. 4. But as many human Souls as have not obtained The Mind as pilot, suffer the same with those of the irrational animals. For becoming co-operator with them and letting loose the desires to which they are borne, tending to- gether (/) by the force of the appetite to the irrational, like as the irrationality of the animals, irrationally enraged and irrationally desiring, they cease not, nor have satiety of the evils. For angers and irrational desires are excessive vices. But for these, as it were avenger and convicter, The God hath set over them the law. 1 5. Tat. There, Father ! the discourse concerning the Fate, that previously uttered to me, is in danger of being , overthrown. For if it is altogether fated to this some one to fornicate or commit sacrilege, or to do any other evil something, why is he punished, he from necessity of Fate having done the deed? (a) tyovffiv.

But with Him ever follows on Justice, avenger of those who depart from the Divine Law\" (Hermann's Edit., v. 118)."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"POEMANDRES. XII. 79 Hermes. Of Fate indeed are all the works, O Child! and apart from that not anything of corporeal things, neither good nor evil happens to be. It is fated too that he having done the evil to suffer. And for this he does it, that he may suffer what he does suffer, because he hath done it. 6. But at the present let be (a) the discourse concerning Vice and Fate ; for elsewhere we have spoken concerning these, but now the discourse with us is concerning Mind, what the Mind can, and how it is different; in men in- deed of such kind, but in the irrational animals changed; and again that in the irrational animals indeed, it is not beneficent, but in men extinguishing both the irascible and the concupiscent (&). And of these one must understand some indeed as persons with reason (c), but others without reason. 7. All men are subject to fate and to generation and to change ; for these are the beginning and end of Fate ; and all men indeed suffer things fated, but those with reason of whom we have said that the Mind is Guide, suffer not in like manner with the others, but having departed from Vice, not being evil, suffer not evil. Tat. Again how sayest thou, Father? A fornicator not evil ? a murderer not evil ? and all the rest ? Hermes. But he with reason (d), Child ! not having fornicated will suffer but as having fornicated; neither having murdered but as having murdered.

But do thou understand and refer this discourse to the enquiry which thou enquiredst of me in what is be- fore : I speak concerning the Fate of The Mind. For if thou wouldest accurately put away the contentious words, O Child ! thou wilt find that truly The Mind, the Soul of The God, dominates over all things, both Fate and Law and all other things; and nothing impossible for it, neither the placing the human Soul up above (e) Fate, nor, having neglected things which happen, to place it beneath The Fate. 2 And let these things indeed, as to so much be spoken, the best of the good Demon.

XII. 81 But the appetites of the irrational animals as I think are passions ; and if also the Mind co-operates with the ap- petites and the appetites of the irrationals are passions, then the Mind also is passion, commingling (a) with the passions. Hermes. Well done, Child ! thou enquirest nobly. It is just for me also to answer. 11. All things, O Child ! incorporeal in body are subject to passion (6), and peculiarly (c) are they passions; for everything moving is incorporeal, and everything moved, body. And incorporeals are moved by the Mind, and movement is passion. Both then have passion (d\\ both the moving and the moved; the one indeed ruling, the other ruled.

But passion differs from what is subjected to passion. For the one energizes, the other is passive. But the bodies also energize of themselves ; for either they are immoveable or are moved ; but whichever it may be it is passion. But incorporeals always energize, and because of this they are subjects of passion. Let not then appellations disturb thee, for both the energy and the passion are the same thing, but to have used the more honourable (e) name is not grievous. 12. Tat.

If the things apparent have all been generated and are generate, but those generated are generate, not of themselves but by other; but many are the generated, rather all the apparent and all the different and dissimilar, and the generate are generate by other : there is some One Who is doing these things, and He ingenerate and older than those generated.

But this is both Superior and One and Only, really wise as to all things, as not having anything older. For He rules both over the multitude, and the magnitude and difference of things generate, and over the continuity (a) of the making and the energy. Then the generated are visible but He invisible. On account of this He makes, that He may be mvisible (&). He always then is making, wherefore He is invisible. Thus He is worthy to under- stand, and for the understander to wonder at, and the wonderer to bless Himself, having recognised his own kindred Father (c). 4. For what is sweeter than an own kindred Father? ^ Who then is He, and how shall we recognise Him ? Whether is it just to ascribe to Him the appellation of The God or that of The Maker, or that of The Father, or also the three? God indeed because of the Power, Maker because of the energizing, Father because of the Good. For Power is different from things generate, but energy is in this, that all things are generated. Wherefore having cast away the much speaking and vain speaking, we must understand these two, That Generate, and The Maker ; for between these is naught, nor any third thing. 5.

For if the Maker is nothing else beside that making, only, simple, incomposite, it is of necessity that He make this same for Himself; since generation is the making by the Maker, and every the generate it is impossible to be generate by itself. Generate must be generated by another. Without Him making, the generated neither is generated, nor is. For the one without the other hath lost its proper nature by deprivation of the other. If then the Entities are acknowledged to be Two, 1 That Generate and That Making, One are they by the Union (a); this indeed preceding but that following. Preceding indeed God The Maker but following That Generate, whatever it may be. 7. And because of the variety of those generate thou shouldst not be scrupulous, fearing to attribute meanness and dishonour to The God. For His Glory is One The Making all things, and this is of The God as it were body, . The Making; but to Him The Maker nothing evil or base is \"^ to be imputed.

How then do we see, Father ! some of the irrational using science and art ; such as the ants treasur- ing up the food for the winter, and the aerial animals also putting together nests for themselves, and the quad- rupeds cognizant of their own folds ? Asclepius. These things they do, Child ! neither by science nor by art, but by Nature. For the science and the art are things teachable (a), but of these irrationals none is taught anything. For things generate by nature are generate by a common (6) energy, but those by science and art belong to knowing ones, not to all ; but what is generate in all is energized by Nature. Thus the Men look upwards, but not all men are musical, nor all archers, nor hunters, nor all the rest ; but some of them have learnt something, science and art energizing. In the same way, if some of the ants had done this but some not, fairly thou hadst said, they do this very thing by science, and by art collect the food; but if all are led alike by the Nature to this even unwilling, it is plain that they do this neither by science nor by art. For Energies, Tat ! them- selves being incorporeal, are in bodies and energize through the bodies. Wherefore, Tat ! in that they are (c) incor- poreal (and thou sayest them to be immortal), and in that they cannot energize apart from bodies, I say that they are always in Body. For things generate for something or because of something, having fallen under (d) Providence or Necessity, it is impossible ever to remain inert of the proper energy. For the Entity always will be ; for this is of it both body and life. To this reason follows there being also always the bodies. Wherefore also I say the very embodiment (e) to be eternal energy. For if bodies upon earth are dissoluble, but bodies there must be, and these places and organs of the Energies, and the Energies are immortal (but the immortal ever is) ; Energy, and the making of bodies therefore (/) ever is.

But some of them energize along with the generating the Man, heing together with (a) the Soul as to things irrational ; but the purer energies according to change of the age energize along with the rational part of the Soul. But the Energies themselves are dependent (6) from the bodies. And from the Divine bodies, these the bodymaking come into things- mortal ; and each of them energizes either about the Body or the Soul. And they are congenerate (c) with the Soul itself apart from body. Always are there energies, but not always is the Soul in mortal body, for it is able to be apart from the body; but the Energies cannot be apart from the bodies. This is a sacred word, Child! Body indeed cannot subsist apart from Soul, but the To Be (d) can. Tat. How sayst thou this, Father ! Hermes. Understand thus, O Son!

There remains then with the Body the energy itself of a separated Soul. This then is the difference of immortal body and of mortal, that the immortal indeed consisted of one matter, the other not, and the one makes, the other is passive (#); for everything that is energizing rules, but that energized is ruled, and the ruling indeed being ordinative (A) and free, leads, but the servile is led.

For never ever fails (a) the World of some one of the Entities, but always borne onward it brings forth (5) in itself the Entities never ever abandoned, by the corrup- tion of it (c). Let every energy then be thought of as always being immortal, which may be in any body whatsover. But of the Energies some are of the divine Bodies, but some of the corruptible, and some indeed are general, but some special (d), and some indeed of the kinds, and some of the parts of each one. Divine indeed then are those energizing in the eternal Bodies, and these are also perfect as in perfect bodies : but partial those, in one of each kind of the animals, but special somewhat those in each of the Entities. This the discourse then, O Child! concludes, that all things are full of Energies. For if it be necessity that the energies be in bodies, but many bodies in World, more I say are the Energies than the Bodies. For in one body often is one, and second, and third, apart from those general following thereon (e). For I call general Energies those really corporeal, generate through the senses and the motions ; for apart from these the energies, it is not pos- sible that the body subsist. But there are other special Energies in the souls of men, through Arts, Sciences, and studies and energizings. For the Senses follow along with the Energies, or rather the senses are effects (/) of the energies.

But the passion and Sense are dependent from one head(c), but are brought together (d) into the same, and by the energies. But of the animals with souls there are two other energies, which follow upon the senses and the passions : Grief and Joy ; and apart from these it is impossible for an animal with soul, and especially a rational, to have sense. Wherefore also I say that these are ideas of the passions, ideas ruling rather over the rational animals. The Energies then indeed energize, but the Senses make manifest the energies. But these being corporeal are moved by the irrational parts of the Soul, wherefore also I say that both are evil imbued (e); for both the rejoicing, occasioning the sensation with pleasure, forthwith happens to be cause of many evils to him having experienced it (/), and the grief occasions stronger sorrows and pains ; where- fore both as it seems would be evil imbued.

For it behoved that the Bodies generated by Him to have such sort also the Nature. But He our Creator being in body hath made us and makes, and ever will make bodies dissoluble and mortal. For it was not lawful for Him to imitate the Creator of Himself, besides it also being impossible. For He indeed made out of the first Essence being incor- poreal; but He out of that embodiment (a) made us. Justly then according to the right reason, these the bodies indeed, as having been generated from an incorporeal Essence, are immortal ; but ours are dissoluble and mortal (the material of us being composed out of bodies), be- cause of being weak and requiring much succour. For how ever even haply had the connection of our bodies kept up, if it had not some nourishment superinduced thereon from the like elements, and refreshing us (&) each day by day? For both of earth and of water and of fire and of air there is an influx generated upon us, which renovating our bodies keeps together the tabernacle. So also for the motions we are rather weak, bearing motions not even one day. For be well assured, Child! that unless in the nights the bodies of us reposed, we should not bear up for one day. Whence the Creator being good having foreprovided (c) all things made the Sleep for the preservation of the Animal, the greatest soother of the fatigue of the motion, and ordained an equality to each time, or rather a longer for the repose. But understand, O Child ! the very great energy of the sleep, opposite to that of the Soul, but not less than that. For as the Soul is energy of motion, the same way the bodies also cannot live apart from the sleep ; for it is relaxation and libera- tion of the compacted members, and it energizes within, making into body the superinduced (d) matter, distributing to each that congenial (e) to it ; the water indeed to the blood, but the earth to the bones and marrows, the air to the nerves and veins, but the fire to the vision.

But in the midst of these are intellectual (/) and sensible Gods.

But these are (i) images of intelligences ; like as Sun is image of The Creator God in Heaven.

For universally upon that having generation change also must follow. For the generate is generate in magnitude, for generate has in- crease; but universally upon that increased follows after diminution; upon diminution corruption.

But the Essence leads and governs as ruler ; but the Eeason of it as the comprehending coun- sellor. The Eeason then of the Essence is knowledge of the ratiocinations, those affording a resemblance of ration- ality to the irrational ; obscure indeed as regards rationality, but rationality as regards the irrational, just as Echo is to- Sound, and the shine of the Moon to the Sun.

OF THE SAME (Stobceus, Physica, 806; Meincke, i. 229; Patrit., p. 41. It is not said from what work of Hermes this is taken). EVERY Soul is immortal and ever moveable. For we have said in the generalities (e) that motions, some indeed are from the Energies and some from the Bodies. We said too that the . Soul was generated from a certain Essence, not of matter, being a thing incorporeal, and being itself of a thing incorporeal. For every generate thing of necessity must be generated from somewhat. Upon the generation of as many then as corruption follows, upon these of necessity two motions follow: that of the Soul by which it is moved and that of the Body by which it is increased, decays and moreover also being decomposed is decom- posed (/). This I define is the motion of corruptible bodies. But the Soul is ever moveable, because it always itself is moved and energizes motion in others.

The Divine then indeed is of the Divine body in which is the Energy of Self, for indeed it is moved in Self, and moves itself, for when it hath departed from mortal animals, having been separated from the irrational parts of itself, going forth into the Divine body as ever moveable, in itself it is moved, car- ried round along with (a) the Universe. But the human has indeed also somewhat of the Divine, but with it are also conjoined (&) the irrationals, both the Desire and the Vehemence (c) ; and these indeed are immortal, because they also happen to be Energies, but the Energies of mortal bodies. Wherefore indeed from the Divine part of the Soul being in the Divine body, they happen to be afar off; but when this has entered into a mortal body, these also walk in (rf), and by the presence of them is generated ever Human Soul. But that of the irrationals is constituted of Vehemence also Desire. Wherefore also these the animals were called irrational, through deprivation of the Eeason of the Soul.

For this is proper to Soul, the affording to others like to its own property. There are thus two lives and two motions; one indeed that according to Essence, but the other that according to nature of Body. And the one indeed more general, the other more partial. But that according to Essence is self determinate (5), but the other of Necessity ; for everything moved is subordinated to the Necessity of the mover. But the moving motion is associated (c) with the love of the intelligent Essence. For the Soul would be incorporeal Essence, nonpartaker of the physical body ; for if it has body it has neither Eeason nor Understanding. For every body is unintelligent (d) ; but having received of Essence, it came (e) to be a breathing animal and the Spirit [or breath] (/) in- deed is of the body, but the Keason is contemplative of the beauty of the Essence. But the sentient Spirit is judicial (g) of the things appearing. It hath been divided into the organic senses, and some portion of it is spiritual vision, and Spirit hearing and smelling and tasting and touching. This the Spirit educated (A) by thought judges the Sen- sible; but if not it fancies only, for it is of Body and receptive of all things. But the Keason of the Essence is the being wise (i).

The astronomical portion is very curious, and is not in- consistent with the theory propounded by Hermes. The account of the celestial Demons or Angels seems to be a compound of Jewish traditions combined with classical notions on the subject.

But to this the Publishers have thought it right to add Thessalonians and Hebrews, by Dr. Liinemann, and the Pastoral and Catholic Epistles, by Dr. Huther. ' I need hardly add that the last edition of the accurate, perspicuous, and learned com- mentary of Dr. Meyer has been most carefully consulted throughout ; and I must again, as in the preface to the Galatians, avow my great obligations to the acumen and scholar- ship of the learned editor.' BISHOP ELLICOTT in Preface to his ' Commentary on Ephesians. 1 ' The ablest grammatical exegete of the age.' PHILIP SCHAFF, D.D. ' In accuracy of scholarship and freedom from prejudice, he is equalled by few.' Literary Churchman. ' We have only to repeat that it remains, of its own kind, the very best Commentary of the New Testament which we possess.' Church Bells. ' No exegetical work is on the whole more valuable, or stands in higher public esteem. As a critic he is candid and cautious ; exact to minuteness in philology ; a master of the grammatical and historical method of interpretation.'
