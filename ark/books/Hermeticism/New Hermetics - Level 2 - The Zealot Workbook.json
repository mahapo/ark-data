This is a tool for rebirth into a higher life, a higher level of being. Before you can truly experience higher consciousness in a practical way, you must overcome the fear of death, and begin to integrate yourself in the inner world of the spiritual life. This program will help you to overcome this fear, and to awaken into the eternity that we all dwell in. Pl ease listen to the program and answer the questions below.

These emotions are actually trying to help us to change negative patterns in our lives, but we often repress these messages and the negative emotions linger in some place of tightness in our bodies. Emotions are meant to move through us, like the ebbs and flows of the sea. It is importa nt to use this program in conjunction with understanding the message that the emotion is giving to us, and listening to its advice. It is only then that you can really let the emotion flow through and away from you fully. Please make note of the negative and positive emotions that you regularly feel.

We will literally create signals for our emotional bodies to automatically shift in a new direction. You can easily adapt the following tool to anchor any emotional state, but with this tool you will at least create an chors for the following positive emotions: CREATIVITY, TRANQUILITY, VITALITY, EXCELLENT COMMU NICATION, INSTANT MEDITATION, INSTANT CONFIDENCE. The anchors will be attached to finger signals that are ba sed on some ancient hand gestures from both the Tantric and the Hermetic magical tradition, and they will be extr emely powerful in helping you to literally transform your life. The diagrams below will indicate them for reference.

You will liste n to this program again later, to more fully condition these anchors. Session 4 - Pranayama 1 - The Complete Breath One of the most effective ways to cleanse and calm your emotional body is through the breath. The next set of programs offer breathing techniques that are based on Eastern Yoga practices. This is one of the only parts of the New Hermetics that specifically uses Eastern technology. The yogis of India have a very scientific understanding of the emotional body and specific techniques for centering and managing the emotions. Please keep in mind the western breathing tools you were ta ught in the Initiate Level, because you will be able to use the technology of charging the br eath energy with intention during your pranayama once you are familiar with these techniques. Do not use these tools within an hour after eating as it may cause abdominal discomfort. If at any time you are feeling excessively uncomfortable please stop and resume again later. The purpose of these tools is to purify, vitalize and calm your body, not to make you ill. If you are in a state of ill health use these tools with caution and build up slowly. The Complete Breath will dramatically increase the oxygen supply in your body. It will allow your heart rate to slow down, calming your body and allowing your central nervous system to relax. Please go ahead and listen to the program now.

The purpose of this tool is to align the right and left sides of your body, so that energy is flowing evenly through your body. As you breat he with this exercise you will use a ratio of 1:4:2 for inhaling: retaining: exhaling. In the instructions we use the count of 4:16:8, but you can eventually adjust this to your personal needs and level of experience. It is said that you begin to develop \"siddhis\" or magical powers such as levitation when you retain the breath for a minute or more, but you'll have to experiment to find out for yourself. You may notice some unusual physical phenomena such as bodily rigidity, perspiration, and feeling lighter than air as a result of using this tool. If you are left handed, you may reverse these instructions as you see fit.
