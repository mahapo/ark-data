The Stellar Man is about a science more elevated than any now known, and what it can do for mankind. This wisdom, the true origin of all knowledge, represents the highest treasure that the human being can ever succeed in possessing in this or any other century, on the planet Earth or anywhere else in the far reaches of th e Universe. It is the arte magnum, the perfect vision of the essential reality of Nature, which encompasses developing the capacity to see oneself objectively, and eval uating the true level of de- velopment of one's own instru ment of knowledge, the mind. All knowledge, in orde r to be true, has to be based on man's internal reality, and has to be in tegrated into a wise, just, om- nipresent, immortal, and eternal nature. The ability to see reality is not a congen ital capacity. The human being is only able to observe the map that he himself created from a subjec tive, limited, and rationalized interpretation. This process creates a personalized pseudo-reality, of which there are as many as th ere are inhabitants of this planet. I call this imaginative creation \"social reality,\" since in practice, the individual is a mere cultural resonator and an appendage of the collective psyche of humanity. This is vii"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"viii THE S TELLAR MAN why people live \"hal f-way\" and are a mi xture of good and bad; why they are a little asle ep and a little awake; why they are insignificant even with all their delusions of grandeur. In other words, th ey do not live profoundly and cannot even grasp the overwhelming significance of this fact. They just graze the surfa ce of the planet and the epi- dermis of knowledge. According to tradition, more than twenty centuries ago, the greatest sage of all lived on our planet; Hermes Tris- megistus, the three times grea t. His Teaching, being of extraterrestrial or igin, was called Hermeticism. Its objective is the profound knowledge of oneself and of the Universe. Ac- cording to Hermes, the micr ocosmos and the macrocosmos are analogous, which is why the conscious penetration into one's own Universe will also le ad the student to universal wisdom. The characteristic of th is knowledge is that it tran- scends time and space, and co rresponds to the secret anatomy of Nature, which like God, has neither beginning nor end. When Hermes wanted to transmit his teachings to a cho- sen few, he found himself f aced with the problem of the limitations of langua ge, which is descriptive and informa- tionally based. This inherent disability made human language inadequate to meet th e desired end, since all au- thentic wisdom is \"meaningful\" and not \"informational.\" It can only be comprehended at the level of BEING, and not through merely intellectual faculties. For this reason, an un- known language had to be used, different from the language of people and nations. It is a \"language of meaning,\" that emanates exclusively from a potent mind at the level of"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"N OTES FROM THE A UTHOR ix higher consciousness, and which far exceeds the habitual condition of man. The \"langu age of the gods\" was the only means that could assure the comprehension of that sublime teaching. Hermes started to transmit hi s Teaching in great secrecy, choosing only the most prepared as his students, due to the great difficulty that such a magnum opus entailed. In time, he succeeded in forming a few inheritors and continuers, Mas- ters who formed an Initiatic Sc hool. They form ed an occult fraternity that fulfille d its work behind th e scenes and in si- lence. They knew th at there were many neophytes who were guided by greed and ambition to obtain unlimited personal power to satisfy sord id passions, rather than a genuine spir- itual or philosophical restlessness. Many of those who gained ad mission into this School failed in their tests and their twisted intention and absolute lack of ethics became eviden t over time. The possession of ethics was an indispensable cond ition to be chos en to receive the highest level of instruction. The limited and superficial information that these pre- tenders thus obtain ed became the basis for the birth of a false and spurious esotericism. It was based on speculation and superstition, and its dissemination is the foundation of the immense majority of what today is erroneously known as \"magic,\" \"occultism,\" and so forth. True and sacred oc- cultism was the knowledge of Hermes, hidden from those who have not succeeded in mastering the language of the gods, and from those who, owin g to their own limitations, pride, and pettiness, were not concerned with developing their higher consciousness."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"x THE STELLAR MAN What is certain is that desp ite the time and difficulties, a few Masters with the necessary power and wisdom to confer Hermetic initiation have existed in every epoch. This initia- tion is a mystical and transcen dental event that offers the individual a certain opportunity to cross the threshold that leads to the path towards spir itual perfection and cosmic wisdom. If the individual trium phs in such an undertaking, he becomes a Stellar Man. This represents the highest goal that Homo sapiens can aspire to, and which corresponds to the culmination of the evolutionary process, but which the species would r each only after many thousands of years of successful development. Maki ng this ascending leap leads the individual to completely overcome his animal condition, thereby moving him up one step on the evolutionary scale in the Universe. The path of sel f-perfection is long and ardu- ous. There can be no other way than to pursue the attainment of authentic power over oneself and one's own existence, and to pursue th e possession of a state of con- sciousness in which disharmony, destructiveness, ugliness, aggression, and unhappiness no longer exist. The real Her- metic Initiate acquires the capa city to transcend such petty realities, to instead place himself in the unlimited and infi- nite context of absolute realit y; that which transcends time and space. From that moment on, he will never again be de- feated by hesitation, loneli ness, or doubt. He will have united himself harmoniously with that unique and powerful force which is a creator and main tainer of life, what Hermes called \"MIND.\" The Hermetic Principle says : \"The ALL is MIND; The Universe is Mental.\" This means that only one class of essen-"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"N OTES FROM THE A UTHOR xi tial energy exists in the cosmos. This energy, this higher con- scious and intelligent force, is divided, and projects itself into infinite vibrations and fo rms of life, thus maintaining the balance of creation and life of all animate and inanimate species. The occult anatomy of the cosmos is the mechanics of Nature, whose forces reciprocally feed from and nourish man, influencing everything in his life. Knowledge, and the use of these forces, is what permits the genuine Hermeticist to act with his mind in different vital situations in order to ensure the achievemen t of his goals. Fate does not exist; everything has a cause and effect; nothing happens by chance. True magic bears no resemblance whatsoever to su- perstition and witchcraft. The tr ue magus, is a KING of his internal world which by anal ogy can influence the external world. \"As it is above, so it is be low.\" \"As it is within, so it is without.\" Guided by voraciou sness and greed, there are many who believe that it is possible to steal the secret and usurp the magic power, supposing that it is based on the development of parapsychological faculties. Nothing is further from real- ity. Magic is the path of the mutant. It is the supreme art, which leads to one's own libera tion and spiritu al perfection. It is the ascending evolutionary spiral that leads the individ- ual to the only true heaven—t he one gained through one's own merit and through internal discipline—it is the legacy of Hermes.

Afire with the thirst for knowledge, he tirelessly pursues any new thesis or theory that may beckon, but, like that of the mythological Tantalus, his thirst, far from being satiated, only increases.

In this world, the one who triumphs is usually the man of the masses who demonstrates perfect submission to the norms of the multi- tude, and who decides at an early age not to think for himself, but to act instead with the multitude's collective mind. This is an unfailing passport to material success, but the price paid is so much higher than the reward. The price is one's own individuality, the much-prized goal of the Del- phic command, \"know thyself.\" As it happens, one who knows himself well and theref ore understands others is often harassed, disregarded, and ostracized. This is due to the fact that leadership usuall y belongs to th e mediocre who glorify the golden calf and celeb rate the empty stereotype of the programmed indivi dual. The temple of Delphi and its ideals no longer ex ist. They have been replaced by the tem- ple of the university , the temple of the law, the temple of religions, and the temple of political ideologies and eco- nomic systems, along with all their slogans and phrases. All these are united by a common denominato r: \"Do not recog- nize yourself; surrender yourself to the multitude and obey its designs.\" Very few people are aware of this situation, but some feel it instinctively and try to rebel against the system, without knowing what really leads them to this reaction.

This willingne ss to merge is con- sidered the correct way to be a nd is seen as the mark of a social conscience. Here again sapiens has missed the point, for it is not possible to help or lo ve others without first knowing oneself. Two thousand years ago, sapiens basically had the same problems he does now; the same fears, desires, anxieties, ambitions, greed, lies, cowardic e, complexes, internal con- flicts, and confusions. His no rms of behavior were no different in essence than those at present. On the other hand, his material conditions were dramatically different from today's circumstances, consid ering the astounding progress that can be observed up until the present day. The question arises whether this same progress has also occurred in the internal nature of sapiens. That is to say, is he a better human being today; does he have more quality as a person than in earlier times? The reply is clearly no. No appreciable change has taken place in th e human quality of sapiens in two thou- sand years, nor even in five thousand years.

To break through the spiritua l isolation of humanity, a superior being full of love and compassion came to the world one day: Christ. He wanted to give sapiens an oppor- tunity to know a different worl d, a world without violence, hate, slavery, or cont radiction, to show sapiens what he could achieve. The collective mind of the multitude, programmed ac- cording to the dictum \"an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,\" violently rejected the Christian message and destroyed the Messiah, as had happened on other occasions when Christ had come to earth, manifest ed through other superior men. This is how the multitudes serv e as an instrument for the Antichrist, the blind monster, th e headless beast that lies in wait for all those who want to achieve the conscious individ- uality which would allow them to stop being sapiens and convert them into Stellar Men. To be Stellar Men is the pinna- cle of the evolution of Homo sapiens. At some time, no one knows when, the false legend of the Antichrist was born . The legend is e rroneous in imagin- ing that a mythological being would be born into the world in order to destroy it thr ough the perversion of Christian values, and that this being woul d incarnate into a man to un- dertake this ominous work. The legend as it exists now might be a distortion of the original Hermetic term Antechrist. In Hermetic circles, the term Antechrist designated one who would act as announcer of Christ, preparing the way. In these terms, the only An- techrist was John the Baptist. Thus, we use the word"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"T HE A NTICHRIST 9 Antichrist to mean contrary to Christ and Antechrist to mean before Christ. Unfortunately, today we ca nnot count on the spiritual impulse of Christ incarnated in a human body. Christ as a di- vine force, omnipresent in religious temples, is but a symbolic allegory th at invites believers to follow a comfort- ing example. No known individual cu rrently possesses a real spiritual force which could be called Christic. The priests of different religions only try to imitate Christ, but unfortu- nately they do it with external and prefab ricated spirituality, in accordance to the stereotypes established by the patri- archs of the church. However, ignorance does no t necessarily mean nonexis- tence. The truth is th at the torch of spirit uality is presently carried by only a few indivi duals who are unknown to the masses. Let us call them the magicians, in the dignified sense of this expression, which is usually employed in a vulgar manner. We are referring to the great initiates, Masters, un- known superior be ings, or occult sages of humanity. Why use the term \"magicians?\" Simply because the igno- rant masses have always thus described those who possess strange qualities or powers unknown to them. Also, there was the Inquisition, which labele d these wise men as such in order to disparage and annul their unusual ideas. For this reason, it is time to adopt this term with pride, with the in- tention of eventually washing away its negative and superstitious stigma.

Why do we designate Christ as the symbol of spiritual- ity? Because Jesus was the most distinguished member of the Magician's Fraternity, prepared specifically for his mis- sion to make Christ incarnate in himself. Jesus and Christ were two different persons; one human, the other, divine. Christ is a superior being wh o is on an advanced level on the scale of evoluti on, which a human be ing could reach in perhaps millions of years of e volution. Let us conceive of him as an extraterrestrial sp iritual power, which we could call an Archangel. This Archangel, due to his very lengthy evolution, possessed perfect a nd powerful spirituality. This is why Jesus went through a lo ng preparation for this role, for he had to be able to with stand an extremely high vibra- tion in his physical body. This vibration could only manifest itself for brief moments, as its intensity could destroy the nervous and cellular system of Jesus' body. Christ was the one who performed miracles through Jesus, who provided the matter for hi s manifestation. The Magician's Fraternity remains well hidd en, as it has a right to its own priv acy, but some of its members have inter- mingled with ordinary people, motivated by the wish to show sapiens the road to a higher lif e. The magicians know, however, that knowledge of The Hermetic Art as an instru- ment to reach spiritual heights, is only for the \"elite\" and is not to be divulged. Neverthele ss, the fraternity of initiates provides the opportunity for an y person with sufficient merit to join the Hermetic elite of Magicians or Stellar Men, if the scope and intelligence of hi s efforts permits him to do so."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"T HE A NTICHRIST 11 The science of the Magicians is called Hermetic Art in honor of Hermes Trismegistus. According to tradition, he ar- rived on earth from outer space approximately thirty thousand years ago, anointed as Supreme Grand Master of the Initiatic Fraternity. Inspired by hi s light, Egypt became great and wise, and the sacred science of its priests was called Hermeticism. In those days, only by means of huge sacrifices and trials was it possible to belong to a Herme tic Initiatic School. The great majority who succeeded in ente ring such a school faltered along the way, lacking the mo ral and spiritual courage to overcome the multiple obstacles, temptations, and trials by which ISIS, mistress of the mysteries of Nature, evaluated the true worth of those who aspired to the supreme knowl- edge of the absolute truth. It was in one of those schools that Jesus himself became a Hermeticist and reac hed the highes t degrees of initiation. Because the time is right, we will divulge the mystery of Jesus the Christ and the causes for the moral su ffering of hu- manity, according to the teachings of the Magician's Fraternity. This moral myster y stems from the adoration of the golden calf; from the submission of the human being to the god of money In honor of this god, he must give up or sacri- fice his spiritual possi bilities in order to be able to subsist. Those who possess adequate means of subsistence generally pervert their potential spiritual values in the foolish game of gaining social positi on on the consumer market.

The money god is sitting above the world, and whoever wishes to enjoy his gi fts must adore him. The real power of money is not only mate rial, but it is principally a hidden force, as the coin is not worth anything in itself; it is only symbolic for human effort or wo rk. By a strange para- dox, although work is intrinsically noble, money, the result of this effort, is under the contro l or influence of a satanic or diabolic power. We invite the reader to medita te on what he could do to corrupt human beings if he wa s Satan; what means or tools would he use to instigate crim e, greed, war, fratricide, and decay of moral values? It woul d be difficult to imagine any- thing more perfectly suited for th is than gold; neutral in its own condition, but diabolical when handled perversely. Does Satan really exist, or is he only a myth created by the masses to explain certain things? If a person believes in the existence of God, then he mu st believe there is a devil or Satan as a counterpart of the Supreme Creator. Because ab- solute unity does not exist in life, the mere existence of something leads us to the affirmation that its opposite is also real. There is no light with out darkness, no good without evil, no truth without falsehood. Death fo llows life, and life follows death. God would thus be the supreme creative intelligence, and the \"devil,\" the destructive intelligence. In the ancient Kabbalah, the devil ha s been symbolized as the shadow of God.

The tradition transmitted by the great Hermetic Masters affirms that at a crucial moment in the history of humanity, a powerful diabolic Archangel, if we are allowed to call him thus, succeeded in penetrati ng the earth's occult defenses and entered its atmosphere , provoking extreme distur- bances. To be able to imagine such a being, we suggest reading the book The Lurker at the Threshold by H. P. Love- craft. According to Hermetic tradition, the direct, albeit unwilling cause of this catastr ophe which affects us to this day, was Moses. Everybody knows that Moses appeared fl oating in a bas- ket down a river and was subs equently adopted, deceiving the Egyptian priests of the time. They took hi m for an Egypt- ian and initiated him into the mysteries of ritual magic, which is a method for making the key notes of Nature vi- brate, and thus produce certain phenomena which the operator wishes to achieve. The study of atomic physics shows us that it is theoretical ly possible to produce changes or transmutations in matter; therefore, there is nothing miraculous about these mutati ons being achie ved by means of secret procedures. In spite of his esoteric identification with Egyptian magic, Moses wa s always loyal to his ances- tral blood. Thus, his most powerful wish was to make himself the leader who would free his people from enslave- ment, leading them to the pr omised land. Guided by this desire, and conscious of the pow erful forces he had learned to control, Moses had a daring idea: to make a magic pact or alliance with an ange l, a divine creatur e charged with the"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"14 THE STELLAR MAN task of providing him with power and assi stance from heaven to save his people. After lengthy preparations done in deep solitude, he per- formed the ritu al ceremony with magic words and corresponding invocations. In the midst of amazing atmos- pheric and terrestrial phenom ena, an impressive being appeared, making Moses tremble with fear and panic, due to the tremendous force it projected. It will never be possible to know or even imagine the conditions under which the pact between man and heaven was made. The angel agreed to everything Moses requested and promised his help, de- manding the strictest obedience in return. He revealed his name as Y., and requested that as a sign of union, all his fol- lowers should undergo a sma ll ritual surgical operation, with a light discharge of blood. Every man who underwent this would come to be a son of Y. The blood that was shed sealed the pact. From that day forward, Mose s was invested with super- human powers and started doing all kinds of magical feats, converting the Ark of the Covenant into the center of his power.

Through long periods of cosmic time, th is being kept his individual- ity, but unfortunately his evol ution was directed toward negative, dark, and de structive aspects; much like a human being who grows bitter with th e passing of time and adopts a negative and destructive concept of life. Many beings similar to Y. ex ist in the Un iverse. Fortu- nately, the magnetic de fenses of the planet constitute an impenetrable barrier against those beings.

It is possible to see this as the most transcendental, but unfortunately harmfu l event in the occu lt history of human- ity. To justify this statement, it is necessary to digress in order to clarify exactly what the planet Earth really is. One can affirm, without fear ing any sarcastic mockery from the ignorant or the semi-wis e, that the planet Earth is a human being.

Regarding rein- carnation, Hermeticism teaches th at a Hermetic initiate of a high degree can achieve the power to reincarnate con- sciously, that is, changing ph ysical bodies while maintaining his individuality and a certain degree of memory. Gradually, in the course of successive liv es, the initiate grows in spiri- tual power. His essence or divi ne spark grows successively more powerful.

Why is it said that Mary rema ined a virgin? This mystery really does not refer to physiolo gical virginity, but to the fact that actually there was no phys ical contact between Jesus' real father and Mary. In effect, his spiritual father was a great Hermetic initiate who etherically used the phy sical body of the Roman soldier to procreate a son. The spiritual seed was transmitted by the occult Master ; the physical sperm by the Roman. In this manner, Mary conceived \"without losing her virginity.\" In those times the term \"virginity\" was not used to designate maidenhood; it was used to distinguish those women initiated in the secret of the \"virgule\" as Mary was.

In what man- ner can we assess ourselves in order to evaluate our own position as living beings? We cannot divide the world in to people who are good or evil, rich or poor, intelligent or stupid, important or insignif- icant. Generally, sapiens forms groups according to instinctive congeniality that is beyond all analysis. This alignment is usually established by qualitie s or defects. Like seeks like, ex cept in amorou s relations where the opposite more frequently occurs. Scientists constantly study the psychology of sapiens, try- ing to somehow justify his infinite contradictions. Innumerable treatises and essays on morality, love, ethics, life, death, the fin ite, and infinite have been written. Never- theless, very little li ght has been shed on the true nature of sapiens. This is not because science lacks knowledge. Rather, this knowledge is rend ered useless due to the human being's inability to measure the true si gnificance of recognized con- cepts. For example, a student can understand perfectly well the statement that human bein gs live in a permanent som- nambulistic state, especially since this fact is well documented, but the student will be absolutely incapable of projecting this concept to the general context of life. The stu- dent will not even remotely grasp all the horror this statement entails. This is how the most arre sting realities go unnoticed even though they are public knowledge. One of the most striking facts is that we are animals.

The majority of people will say they understand perfectly that they are animals, but it is certain that it will be ab solutely impossib le for them to visualize the amazing implicati ons of this statement. Thus \"science knows much but is ignora nt of almost everything.\" In this case we can well recall Desmond Morris's The Naked Ape, a study of the hum an animal. His book had a great im- pact on the public. The crude examination of the animal characteristics of sapiens made a true zool ogical portrait. What happened before this? Didn't people know that Homo sapiens was a monkey? Of course th ey did, but no one truly evaluated the significance of it. Yet sapiens feels very proud of his ta lent, his creative ge- nius, his capacity for reasoning, his capacity for affection and creative power, calling hims elf the \"highest living mani- festation of intelli gence,\" or the \"m ost perfect living creature.\" Sapiens is particularly satisfied with his culture, and pre- sumes that his abilit y to transmit it to future generations makes him enormously different from other animal species who apparently lack this ability. Likewise, sapiens affirms that he possesses the highest privileges inherent in the de gree of \"civiliz ation\" obtained by his species. Statements such as, \"all human beings have the right to happiness\" and \"a ll human beings are free in na- ture,\" illustrate this. In othe r words, this is equal to maintaining that the mere fact of having been born gives a sapiens creature the right to liberty, happ iness, love, and well-being. In fact, Homo sapiens not only does not have any right to"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"28 THE STELLAR MAN liberty, happiness, or any well-being that he has not earned for himself, but furthermore, he is not even remotely as in- telligent, rational, and superior as he believes himself to be. On the contrary, sapiens is virtually insi gnificant in the total context of nature, and this work will endea vor to reveal his intellectual mediocrity, his somnambulistic state, and his unreal existence. Sapiens is a functionally deficient and an- thropologically immature creatu re who, for reasons of his own self-esteem, prefer s to bury this fact in the deepest re- cesses of his subconscious, an d instead dreams about his own illusory intelligence and power. It would be absurd to think that in a world inhabited by rational, conscious, and intelligent beings, the latent danger of total destruction by a nuclear war could exist. The very fact that punitive laws exist shows that people do not con- duct themselves in a manner guided by reason, justice, tolerance, duty, and correct action. Insanity, psychological comp lexes and disturbances, sui- cide, crimes of passion, a nguish, uncontrollable ambition, and assassinations are proof of people's irra tional conduct. Thus, sapiens claims to have a series of qualities, powers, and privileges that only exis t in his imagination. When Calderon de la Barca said that \"life is but a dream,\" he was more correct than anyon e could ever imagine. The sapiens species provides material in sufficient quan- tity and numbers for Nature so that, according to her own laws, a few beings are produce d who can finally fulfill an evolutionary goal. These few can truly reach a human condi- tion and enjoy all the privileges th is involves, su ch as liberty, happiness, well-being, and love . The masses simply provide"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"D ISSECTION or S APIENS S 29 the raw material for the social experiment of Nature and History. Nature is cold and has neither preferences nor bi- ases for anyone in particular. This is no reason for peop le to despise themselves, wrongly believing themselves to be inferior creatures. The fact is simply that Homo sapiens' age in evolutionary terms is barely that of a child. In this condition, he cannot be ashamed of not acting like an adult. In fact, the relatively conscious behavior of the human being barely extends over a few thousand years. If we had to compare sapiens' age as a species with that of an actual sapiens person, the conscious age of the species is bare ly eight or ten years old. It is hoped that once sapiens comes of age, in cosmic time, not terrestrial time, he will attain a degree of maturity. Humanity accepts as normal all individuals whose bio- logical and psychological behavior adjusts to collective rules. The one who separates himself from these norms is considered abnormal. However, we never question how close normal is to the optimum. It could be that normal is much nearer to deficiency or imperfection than it is to optimum. Is it not possible, for exampl e, that geniuses are not so extraordinarily inte lligent, but the othe r way around; that the rest of humanity is extr aordinarily stupid?

He will observe sapiens as mentally but no t intellectually retarded, as irresponsible, and behaving like a hypnotized person. This particular pro cess of knowledge which has been called revelation or illumination in some men who are saints, is later verified when the individual steps out of his state of superior consciousness and descends to an ordi- nary level, and observes the behavior of people who prove and demonstrate in daily lif e the truth of the knowledge the initiate acquired.

This faculty of consciousness, which most people lack, is only born in per- sons who, for a variety of r easons, have reached a higher than normal level of awakeness in life; who in a certain sense have awakened, liberating th emselves from the somnambu- listic hypnosis which afflicts the masses. Homo sapiens is in general an integrally programmed being at the cerebral, emotiona l, instinctive, and physical levels. What psychology calls personality can also be defined as an individual program. Each individual po ssesses an intri- cate and extensive cerebral pr ogram due to the effects of heredity, education, culture, imitation, learning, conditioned reflexes, and so on. So when a person thinks, he can only do so within the basic contex t of his cerebral program from which he cannot deviate for any reason, even if he tries to do so. Each person must necessarily keep to his cerebral script and cannot do anything other than manifest himself in it and through it. In order to understand this, one can think of program and consciousness as absolutely contradictory elements. Con- sciousness implies the capaci ty for change, choice, and self-determination, which obvi ously is not possible in a being who is the visible mani festation of a program. The Great Programmer can be called God, Universal Father, Cos- mic Intelligence, or any other name, but the reference is always clear.

The individual sleeps by night, but is awake by day. What is not considered is th at sleep and wakefulness repre- sent two extremes of psychological awareness, and between these two poles there are ma ny degrees. Thus, during the night a person may sleep either lightly or extremely deeply. The same occurs with wakefulness, in which a person can be barely awake or extremel y alert. Due to this, sapiens gradu- ally came to believe that his usual state of awareness during the day is being awake. In reality, this awareness is a state of hypnotic or somnambulis tic sleep in whic h a person can be dispersed while still ha ving the appearance of being awake. Programmed intelligence apparently cannot perceive itself as being affected by hypnosis, es pecially when there is no one sufficiently awake to point it out. Ne vertheless, history relates episodes in the lives of some philosophers who, be- cause they became awakened men, understood the truth, had access to a profound and substantial reality, and tried to communicate their knowledge to others to help them awaken.

In this way, the intelligence sapiens possesses, even when brilliant, is a mechanical, dead, and programmed intelli- gence. What about our creative cap acity, it can be objected, when man proves hi s creative genius all the time? The reply to this is that th e cerebral and cultural programming of the learned and wise man grows constantly, but always follow- ing the already established patte rns. A person can constantly study or investigate, but always within th e limits of the basic content of his intellect. Thus , he accumulates thousands of heterogeneous and homogeneous elements, which in his daily intellectual work can produce infinite combinations by the mechanics of thought, but not by an authentic process of creation.

The Hermetic philosopher who has truly converted him- self into an awaken ed man has a living, awake, creative, and unprogrammed intelligence. This is the exact op posite of the vast majority of humanity.

The aims of the Hermeticist are eternal; the aims of the profane are temporal and finite. Deprived of the mind's superior possibilities, sapiens ob- scurely senses his own weak ness and vulnerability in the face of destiny, deat h, illness, war, poverty, and dangerous changes.

Fortunately, or unfortunately, man blunts his higher faculties and is not aware of all the horror of hi s existence in a mad world.

There is no provision for scre ening those who, by virtue of their position, are affected by the phenomenon of psycho- logical inflation due to the prestige that their position confers upon them. The term \"psychological inflation,\" coined by Jung, describes the disorientati on experienced by a person when he identifies himself with the position he occupies and is led astray in his self-evalu ation. In this way, a physician could inflate or raise himself to the high level of importance and dignity which society confer s on a doctor due to his pro- fessional title. But a person is not what his title or position represents; he is merely a pe rson who cannot claim for him- self the importance and grande ur granted to the medical profession in general, because thousands of people belong to this profession. Without realizing this, the person subject to inflation tries to usurp or attribute to himself alone, the force, power, and importance which do es not belong to him, but which is actually granted by society. We know there is no psycho logical control, that in- evitably thousands of innocent victims pay in different ways for the insanity of those in ch arge of administering our civi- lization. Legal errors, abuse of power, fatal political mistakes which degenerate into armed conflict, the usurping of power by financial mafias, obsolete or erroneous educational sys- tems; all of this is in some way provoked by the mentally disturbed.

Therefore, no scientific event or discovery will be far-reaching in impor tance until human nature is changed and raised to a higher level. On the other hand, even sma ll pebbles make a mountain after eons of time. In order to understand this, it must be ac- cepted that there will be no real progress and evolution until human nature changes. It is precisely this grand work to which the great Her- metic Initiates are pledged, and it is for this reason that there are true Hermetic schools where people are given an oppor- tunity to elevate themselves.

This will enable us to verify the hidden actio n of a certain type of force, which takes po ssession of people under certain circumstances. In the following relevant ex tracts from Gustav Le Bon's work, The Crowd, he states: In its ordinary sense, the wo rd \"crowd\" represents a gath- ering of individuals of whatever nationality, profession, or sex, and whatever may be th e chances that have brought them together. From the psychological poin t of view, the expression \"crowd\" assumes quite a diffe rent meaning. Given certain"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"T HE C OLLECTIVE S OUL OF THE S PECIES 49 circumstances, and only under th ose circumstances, an ag- glomeration of men presents ch aracteristics very different from those of the individuals composing it. The sentiments and ideas of all the persons in the gathering take one and the same direction, and thei r conscious pe rsonality van- ishes. A collective soul is formed, withou t a doubt, but displays very clearly defined characteristics. The gathering has thus become what, in the absence of a better expres- sion, I will call an organized crowd, or, if the term is considered preferable, a psyc hological crow d. It forms a single being, and is subjected to the law of mental unity of crowds. In this description by Le Bon it can be seen how the cen- tral computer acts with force in grouping people into psychological crowds or masses. Nevertheless, a mass may be composed of two, three, five , or forty people, as the psy- chological meaning of crowds or masses is different from the common one. When a person has developed a strong indi- viduality, he is less sensitive to this coercion of the masses. Le Bon continues: . . . In the case of everything that belongs to the realm of sentiment—religion, politics, morality, affection and an- tipathies, etc.—the most eminent men seldom surpass the standard of the most ordinary individuals. From the intel- lectual point of view an a byss may exist between a great mathematician and his boot-make r, but from the point of view of character the differen ce is most often slight or non- existent ... In the collective mind the intellectual ap titudes of the individuals, and as a consequence their individual- ity, are weakened. The heterogeneous is swamped by the"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"50 THE STELLAR MAN homogeneous, and the unconscious qualities obtain the upper hand. The very fact that crowds possess common ordinary qualities explains why they can never accomplish acts de- manding a high degree of intelligence. The decisions affecting matters of general in terest come to by an assem- bly of men of distinction, but specialists in different walks of life, are not sensibly superior to the decisions that would be adopted by a gathering of imbeciles. The truth is, they can only bring to bear in common on the work at hand those mediocre qualities which are the birthright of every average individual. In cr owds, it is st upidity and not mother-wit that is accumulated. We see, then, that the disa ppearance of the conscious personality, the predominance of the unconscious person- ality, the turning by means of suggestion and contagion of feelings and ideas in an iden tical direction, the tendency immediately to transform the suggested ideas into acts; these we see, are the principl e characteristics of the indi- vidual forming part of a crowd. He is no longer himself, but has become an automato n who has ceased to be guided by his will. Moreover, by the mere fact th at he forms part of an or- ganized crowd, a man descen ds several rungs on the ladder of civilization. He further states: Crowds exhibit a docile respect for force, and are but slightly impressed by kindness, which for them is scarcely other than a form of weakness.

It is true that they willingly trample on the despot whom they have stripped of his power, but it is because, having lost his strength, he has resumed hi s place among the people, who are to be despised because they are not to be feared . . . A crowd is always ready to revolt against a weak au- thority and bow down servil ely before a strong one. Should the strength of an authority be intermittent, the crowd, always obedient to it s extreme sentiments, passes alternately from anarchy to servitude, and from servitude to anarchy. However, to believe in the predominance among crowds of revolutionary instin cts would be to entirely mis- construe their psychology. It is merely thei r tendency to violence that deceives us on this point. Their rebellious and destructive outbursts are always very transitory. Crowds are governed too mu ch by unconscious considera- tions, and as a consequence subject too much to secular hereditary influences to not be extremely conservative. Abandoned to themselves, th ey soon weary of disorder, and instinctively tu rn to servitude. From Le Bon's skillful desc ription, we can see how the cen- tral computer manipulates people, c onverting them into puppets in the service of an established plan. What plan? The evolutionary plan for sapiens, which must adjust to certain rules of the game. The general rules are as follows: 1. Considered collectively as a species, sapiens is not and can not be free. 2.

Doesn't sapiens profit from other animal species? Are there not animals which exist exclusively to feed sapiens? Minerals feed upon cosmic rays; plants on minerals; animals on plants; ma n feeds on all these, and the gods feed on man. 3. Sapiens is, therefore, a slave in perpetuity; neve rtheless, in dividual or isolated beings separated from the group may become free. 4. The only possible freedom is liberation from the central com puter and the only way to attain this is by conquering and surpassing oneself. 5. Sapiens is obliged to comply with the rules of the game in the system to which he has been assigned. 6. The evolution of sapiens comes inevitably with time, but measured in cosmic, not terre strial time. Perhaps he may have to wait millions of terrestrial years in order to reach perfection. 7. There is no evolution of the sapiens individual; onl y that of the species as stated above. If a sapiens individual desires to evolve, he must convert himself into a mutant human for whom evolution exists. 8. There are other rules of the game, but only those already in dicated can be reveal ed at this time. In order to explain the modus operandi of the sapiens plan, the hierarchy of the oper ating forces will be explained. The diagram that follows endeavors only to briefly de- scribe the basic forces which act in the Universe: God, the Creator, in his double ma nifestation of life and death, light and darkness, of the sleep stat e and the state of vigilance, abases his power until able to act conc retely through certain"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"T HE C OLLECTIVE S OUL OF THE S PECIES 53 \"angels\" who direct the evolutionary plan. Hermetic tradi- tion calls them the Archons or Lords of Destiny. With reference to sapiens, this plan is maintained by virtue of dream ener gy, as can be seen in diagram 1. Never- theless, the divine irradiati on of luminous energy, which we call Vigilance, reaches the planet Earth but is not manifested in sapiens. Sleep energy, directed or manipulated by the Ar- chons, maintains the programming of the system even down to the smallest group, the family. Those who \"have eyes to se e and ears to hear\" will draw incalculable advantage from the comprehension of this system. To give a concrete example, this master key can be used to explain certain stra nge events in the life of Jesus which in this light, appear rati onal and crystal clear. Why did Jesus appear to be so tremendously antagonistic toward the family? Recall his words: \"I have co me to set a man against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daugh- ter-in-law against her mothe r-in-law. And the enemies of man should be their own families. He who loves his father or mother more than he loves me, is not worthy of me; and he who loves his son or daughter more than me, is not wor- thy of me.\" When Jesus was told that his mother and brothers were outsi de and wished to speak to him, he replied: \"Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?\" and he stretched out his hand towards his disciples saying: \"Here are my mother and my brothers .\" When one of his disciples asked him for leave to bury his father, Jesus said, \"follow me and let the dead bury their dead.\""},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"54 THE STELLAR MAN Strange words for one wh o preached of love! Nevertheless, the explanation is simple. Looking at dia- gram 1, it can be seen that th e family is the ultimate nucleus that maintains dream or hypnotic energy: the instrument of sapiens' slavery to animal unconsciousness. Thus, if Jesus wished his di sciples to see the light, to awaken and evolve, by necessi ty they had to break the chains of sleep. Of course, it is unde rstood that this ex ample can be ap- plied solely to those who wish to forever follow a path toward spiritual advancement, leaving the world aside and foregoing human affection, as must have been the case with the twelve apostles. It is al so necessary to understand that two families may exist: the animal family of sapiens and the divine family (human). Needle ss to say, any family, which by virtue of the spiritual ad vancement of its members be- comes free from the action of sleep, is in truth converted into a divine family. The family nucleus should be solidly united, not by oneiric force or blood ti es, but by an au thentic spiri- tual communion. Regarding material freedom, sapiens will greatly progress and, without doubt, will someda y free himself from the Bib- lical saying: \"you will earn you r bread by the sweat of your brow.\" The advance of science and its techniques allows us to surmise or foresee that th e working day will shorten in proportion to the degree of au tomation achieved by special- ized machines (robots) which undertake the heavy work previously accomplished by ma n.

The phenomenon of psychological inflation made known by Jung, to whom we have alre ady referred, strongly affects common man. He identifies with science, arts, culture, tech- nological progress, and civ ilization and absorbs them, confusing them with himself. Th us he loses sight of himself and lives on a level of importa nce and qualifications entirely beyond him, and which in truth correspond to the sum total of the efforts of man since his existence upon Earth. By means of a psychologi cal trick, he multiplies his own worth by millions, and the result is a deep satisfaction with his self- esteem. In order to analyze a pers on and judge his individual value, we must alwa ys divest him of all the honors, digni- ties, inheritances, authority, and privileges which society has conferred on him. Unfortunately, our analysis will be very discouraging, for in the majority of cases, within this inflated being we will not find the human being wh ich this covering hides; he has died, devoured by life itself; or perhaps he never existed in the first place. It is for this reason that a human being always hides behind numerous masks and dis- guises, for in this way his absolute insign ificance goes unnoticed. The smaller an individual is, the more he endeav- ors to inflate himself to appear important in the eyes of others and thus raise his self-esteem."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"T HE C OLLECTIVE S OUL OF THE S PECIES 57 Psychology asserts that the most profound principle of human nature is the desire to be appreciated, and therefore there exists a demand for self-exa ltation. It is said that the experience most sought after by man is the increase of his self-esteem, and the trait most di fficult to eradicate is vanity. In Personality: A Psycholog ical Interpretation, Doctor Gor- don Allport states the following regarding self-esteem: Whatever the ultimate charac ter of this pr inciple, its cruder forms of expression result in extraordinary strate- gies of conduct. It alone is responsible for a great super- structure of masquerade built up in every life. All in the interests of self-esteem one may cover one's true emo- tions, put on a front, and at considerable cost avoid exposing one's weaknesses. The persona that develops pro- tects one from unwelcome narcissistic wounds. What is even more spectacular, likewise in the interest of self-esteem, is the capacity men have for deceiving them- selves . . . The techniques of self-d eception are numerous. Psy- chological usage, groups them all under the si ngle title of rationalization, a term signifying, of course, precisely the opposite of reason . . . Reason fits one's impulses and be- liefs to the world of reality; rationalization fits one's conception of reality to one's impulses and beliefs. Or, as the aphorism has it, reasoning discovers real reasons, and rationalization, good reasons, for what we do.

The study of the mechanisms of the pe rsonality is invalu able in understand- ing the operating system of the central computer.

In order to truly comprehend the significance of this fact, it is suffi- cient to consider that we are only a vital emanation of the collective soul, a stru cture without any aut onomy or a life of our own. In the light of this truth, we can understand many psychological phenomena whic h are not very clear, but which are decisively important in human life. Take for exam- ple anxiety, which is the hidden re ason for many of man's acts. In The Art of Loving, Erich Fromm maintained that: The experience of separateness arouses anxiety; it is, in- deed, the source of all anxiety. Being separate means being cut off, without any capacity to use my human powers . . . The awareness of human separation, without reunion by love — is the source of shame. It is at the same time the source of guilt and anxiety. The deepest need of man, then , is the need to overcome his separateness, to leave the prison of his aloneness. We must ask ourselves: why is there such a fear of isola- tion? Isolation from what? Obvi ously that necessity of union corresponds to the tie with the collective soul or central com- puter. All attempts or possibility of separation, by virtue of an external or inte rnal influence, produces panic, and this panic is experienced by the human animal when threatened with separation from the flock.

For this rea- son, anguished sapiens has invented certain tricks or flawed and artificial solutions, which enable him to temporarily pla- cate his deep fear. Fromm spea ks of the following attempts to escape the stat e of separation: 1. ORGIASTIC STATES: One way of achieving this aim lies in all kinds of orgiastic states. These may have the form of an auto-induced trance, sometimes with the help of drugs. Many rituals of primi- tive tribes offer a vivid picture of this type of solution. In a transitory state of exaltation the world outside disappears, and with it the feeling of separateness from it. Inasmuch as these rituals are practiced in common, an experience of fu- sion with the group is added wh ich makes this solution all the more effective. Such orgiastic states may be brought about with drugs, cer- tain rituals, by alcohol, an d by sexual ex perience. Although the rituals of primitive tribes of fer this kind of solution, this same solution is also present in more civilized society in reli- gious rituals which pr oduce an experience of fusion with the group and with a divinity who forgives the sin and rewards the believer, granting him a state of grace. Fromm continues: Alcoholism and drug addiction are the forms which the in- dividual chooses in non-orgiastic culture. In contrast to those participating in the socially patt erned solution, such individuals suffer from guilt feelings and remorse. While they try to escape from separate ness by taking refuge in al- cohol or drugs, they feel all the more separate after the"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"T HE C OLLECTIVE S OUL OF THE S PECIES 61 orgiastic experience is over, and thus are driven to take re- course to it with increa sing frequency a nd intensity. 2. CONFORMITY WITH THE GROUP: Also in contempora ry Western society, union with the group is the prevalent way of overcoming separateness. It is a union in which the individual self disappears to a large extent, and where the aim is to belong to the herd. If I am like everybody else , if I have no feeli ngs or thoughts which make me different, if I c onform in custom, dress, and ideas, to the pattern of the group, I am saved from the frightening experience of aloneness. Nevertheless, the price to be paid is very high, as it involves freedom and individua lity. Furthermore, as stated by Fromm, union by conformity is not intense or violent; it is serenity dictated by routine, and due to th is, at times is insufficient to alleviate the anguish of separa tion, and then comes the need to indulge in orgiastic practices . Fromm is of the opinion that flock-like conformity only offers the advantage of being per- manent and not spasmodic, as th e individual is introduced to the conformity pattern at three to four years of age, and from that moment never loses contact with the flock. He even an- ticipates his funeral as the last event of social importance, remaining strictly within the pattern. 3. CREATIVE ACTIVITY: In any kind of creative work the person creating unites himself with his material, wh ich represents the world out- side himself. Whether a carpe nter makes a table, or a"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"62 THE STELLAR MAN goldsmith a piece of jewelry, whether the peasant grows his corn or the painter paints a pict ure, in all type s of creative work the worker and his ob ject become one, man unites himself with the world in the process of creation. . . . The unity achieved in produc tive work is not interper- sonal; the unity achieved in orgiastic fusion is transitory; the unity achieved by conf ormity is only pseudo-unity. Hence, they are only partial answers to the problem of ex- istence. The full answer lies in the achievement of interpersonal union, of fusion with another person, in love. 4. UNION BY LOVE: This complete solution can onl y be reached when there is genuine love and not just a pa ssional or symbiotic union. A passional union is one in which a person is a slave to passion and in reality his activity is a passiveness, because he is im- pelled, and it is he who unde rgoes the act and not he who accomplishes it. A symbiotic union is produced when there is a dependence in which both need each other mutually and absorb each other reciprocally. It is a form of vampirism or parasitism. Fromm describes genuine love very clearly: Union by love is only valid wh en there is mature love, that is, a union that allows and maintains individualism. In contrast to symbiotic union, mature love is union under the condition of preserving one's integrity, one's individual- ity. Love is an active power in man; a power which breaks through the walls which sepa rate man from his fellow men, which unites him with ot hers; love makes him over- come the sense of isolation and separateness, yet it permits him to be himself, to retain his integrity. In love,"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"T HE C OLLECTIVE S OUL OF THE S PECIES 63 the paradox occurs that two beings become one and yet remain two. From this profound descri ption by Fromm, we see sapi- ens' main motivation in life, his deep anguish, is based on the fear of freedom with resp ect to the central computer. Using the master key of knowle dge of the collective soul of sapiens, the reader could well analyze any aspect of social psychology. Whether it be love, politics, war, ar t, morals, jus- tice, or injustice, everythi ng can be understood through prior knowledge of the myster y of the central computer. After reading this far, many readers may be puzzled, as perhaps they expected more magic, mystery, and occultism. Perhaps they desired the revelation of fantastic secrets, which would enable them to unfold with a simple abra- cadabra or attain clairvoyance with the opening of a third eye. Patience! The most impati ent and superficial person is the one who sees least. Only the one who senses that great truth is found in that which is simple will be able to see be- neath the surface of a ppearances. People always seek that which is complicated, believing there is an equivalence be- tween complexity and truth. If we meditate deeply, we will find it is much more difficult to notice the simple than the complex. That which is simple appears so unattractive that no one bothers to study it or make an ef fort to delve beneath its surface. Nevertheless, truth is in that which is simple, and for this reason it is said that \"truth is written in the open book of Nature.\" Trut h is strewn everywhe re and no one no- tices it. It is more difficult to \"know what is already known\" than to learn about something of which on e is ignorant. The"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"64 THE STELLAR MAN already-known merits no atte ntion and in any event is tainted with prejudices. It is for this reason that true intellect is hidden away in the attic of the insignificant and useless, sc orning the pro- found treasure it may contain. The mystery of occultism an d magic is based on under- standing what is already know n to everyone, but which no one understands. For this r eason, the commo n man wanders about lost and disori ented, endeavoring to find mysterious masters in India, to acquire strange parapsychological quali- ties, or to find curious and hidden manuscripts with magic secrets. The word \"occultism\" does not define unknown knowl- edge, but a teaching, which is hidden due to human stupidity, snobbery, su perficiality, fantasy, and the lack of a state of higher awareness. It is due to this that at many times, lacking the abracadabra, the student feels cheated as he ex- pected magic. But, what is the gene ral concept of magic? Magic is the food of hope for lazy people who believe it is sufficient to learn tricks or attain certain powers to be able to reach the fulfillment of all thei r desires through magic, with- out any effort whatsoever. That is to say, they visualize the magic art as an arbitrary exer cise, a procedure in which the world and Nature would be su bject to the whims and de- sires of the magician. We must now disillusion them, as that which is arbitrary does not exist in the Universe, and should it exist, it would bring about the destruction of the Cosmos.

Ne vertheless, we must not forget that the effort required is alwa ys relative to the importance of the goal being pursued, and we know of no higher or more noble goal than to be converted into a true human being with higher spiritual qualities. Many people identify magic with parapsychological abil- ity, believing that th e highest goal of occultism consists in developing PSI powers.

At first glance, the question s eems to be the framework for a decision to live or die; no one thinks that he is not from the moment he has evid ence of existence, sees himself, and realizes he possesse s a material body which oc- cupies space. Any normal hum an being who asks himself, \"am I or am I not?\" must reply affirmatively. T Nevertheless, Hermet icism affirms that sapiens is not. How can this be understood? .. . Only through greater preci- sion and depth in the comprehe nsion of related concepts. For this it is necessa ry to work with tw o philosophical trian- gles, which follow. Sapiens has a physical body, with a divine spark or spirit, and a \"psychological I\" or personality. If we ask if so-and-so is, and we refer to the body and the \"psychological I,\" we"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"68 THE STELLAR MAN must reply in the affirmative. On the other hand , if we refer to the spirit or \"Superior I,\" our reply will be no. In order to understand this, we must realize that we are speaking of a pers on, and that this person lives in the mate- rial world in a material body. This body is cl early seen and cannot be denied as it occupies space. Th e \"psychological I\" of this body also constantly mani fests itself (perhaps it is never otherwise) and we have evidence of this. Neverthe- less, the \"Superior I\" or th e spirit, in spite of being incarnated in matter, lives its own life in its own related world. This \"Superior I\" is not manifested in the body or the real world, and therefore, it is not in the material reality of the present time. It is certain that for those pe ople who do no t believe that the spirit or the spirit in sapiens exists, this explanation has absolutely no value. Those individuals must ask themselves the following question: \"Who am I? Surely I am not the body, nor am I so-and-so. Could I be the thinker? Who am I?\" Continuing along this line, we maintain that the spirit or immortal essence, the \"Superior I,\" lives in a mysterious limbo to which we have no access. From that limbo a fine thread"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"To B E OR N OT TO B E ? 69 reaches to the psychological awareness, giving the individual a sense of spirituality. Nevertheless, the spirit is neve r manifested in the individual's brain, and as a result, is never manifested in the concrete reality of the material world. Therefore, if I ask myself, \"am I or am I not?\" this question refers to the essential being and I must reply: \"I am in the limbo where I exist as a spiritual being, but I am not in the material world where my physical body lives in the reality of the present time. And as it is of no use to me to be in limbo, I must accept that 7 am not. On the other hand, so-and-so (my 'psychological I') is, and exists to a certain extent in material reality.\" This brings us to the basic ob jective of true occultism (the esoteric and not the exoteric) which is: 1. T h a t sapiens be transformed into man 2. That this man be spiritual The main goal of Hermeticism is sp irituality, about which there are many mistaken ideas. For the majority of people , spirituality is a mysterious mystical state in which the individual reaches absolute purity, abstention from meat and alc ohol, sexual chastity, and a life apart from material existence, living in an ocean of kindness, love, and renunciation. Painters frequently depict saints as skeletal men, thin-faced, with sunken eyes an d an appearance of gentleness. Nearly all the pictures of Christ depict him as very weak and undernourished, without strength or vigor. This false image of spirituality is what all those who have spiritual inquietude try to adopt. To become spiritual in truth means only one thing: \"that the spirit manifests itself th rough one's own brain.\" Thus, the in-"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"70 THE STELLAR MAN dividual is spiritual because hi s spirit has access to material, concrete, and temporal reality. If, however, as a consequence of this fact certain superior qu alities are awaken ed in the in- dividual, that is another matter. Adding the concept of time to the subject we are study- ing enables us to visualize the phenomenon of being in a much more luminous fo rm. In relation to time, we are not in- terested in any of the complicated Einste inian equations, but only in the concepts of past, pr esent, and future. In fact, only the present is of positive interest; the past and the future rep- resent only negative concepts in this analysis. Let us recapitulate and add tim e to our reflective process: sapiens possesses a physical body wh ich has a \"psychological I\" and a \"Superior I\" or spirit . This body, which is material, occupies a location in space an d a position in time. Let us now place these constituent parts in time and space: Present 1. Physical body Without any doubt it is (that which is concrete) located in the present, that is, it exists in the present reality. It has a correct space-time location according to our earthly reality. Past, Present, 2. \"Psychological I \" Space: Indeterminate and Future (that which is mental) Time: Fluctuates between past, present, and future. That which is, 3.

Neverthe- less, within these absolute realities there are temporal or relative truths, which are degrees of the ab solute on an infi- nite scale of leve ls, each one having absolute and relative laws. In our condition as Homo sapiens, we live in the reality of the world which we know, that is, material body and ter- restrial time. If we were to liv e on a distant planet, we might perhaps have an etheric or gaseous body, and a time ade- quate for the planet on which we would live. Therefore, our fundamental reality as sapiens is the mate- rial world of the planet Eart h, governed by terrestrial time, measured by terrestrial clocks. This is our concre te reality, as concerns our life in a biological body. Carefully following the development of this subject, we will reach the following conclusions: 1. Our physical body lives adjusted to the absolute reality of the vital conditions which govern our existence. Terrestrial time passes with respect to our body, according to the hands on the clock. 2. Our \"psychological I\" is a fan opened towards the past, present, and future. It is never completely in the present, in the past, or in the future. With respect to time, it is different from the physical body; it has a different location in time. 3. Our spirit lives in cosmic ti me, but in itself is beyond time. It is what is, what has been , and what will eternally be. Our inability to be spiritual resides in the fact that our spirit and our body do not coincide in time; therefore there can"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"72 THE STELLAR MAN be no communication between th em. To make our spirit and body coincide, there are two basic methods: A - Chaos B - Order Both systems require a mediator or intermediary as the contact between body and spirit. In the case of A — Chaos, the individual uses his subconscious (in which the past, present, and future coexist) to unite w ith the spiritual. It is called chaos because it produces disori entation in tim e and space, which may affect the material conditions of an individual's life, but increases his spiritual illumination. In B— Order, an artificial mediator is created by means of theurgy; but it is superconsci ous, not subconscious. Further on, this will be explained in more detail. Each method attempts to bring the spirit to the temporal reality of the physical body, be cause the reve rse cannot be done. In order to explain the mystery of being, the student must zealously study the concepts of being and not being. The stu- dent must identify himself with these states. Being, naturally, corresponds to reality, and not being corresponds to fantasy. Stated in another way, all that is fantastic, in the sense of illu- sory fantasy, is not, as this corresponds solely to a subjective vision of the individual. On the other hand, reality IS, as it is equivalent to the objective contemplation of a phenomenon, which exists either externally, apart from the individual, or as an internal phenomenon, but which is perfectly studied, verified, and delineated."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"To B E OR N OT TO B E ? 73 It is humbling to observe how much the human being lives in a purely fantastic or illusory subjective personal world, without ever encounteri ng concrete and objective re- ality. This is explained by sapiens' dream-like state, as each person has a world of dreams or person al fantasies corre- sponding to his desires or fears. Thus, to a certain extent, each person lives in his own fantasy world imaginatively cre- ated according to hi s unconscious needs. There is an absolute key which gives us a reference point for understanding the mystery of being, and this key is ex- pressed in the followi ng Hermetic concept: \"the only reality is the present moment; there is no pas t or future; both are illusory.\" The past existed and th e future will exist. What is the present? The present is the exact point of union between the past and the future. If we are able to understand that the only reality is the present moment, we will re ach the foundation of the mys- tery of to be and not to be. Life is composed of real, absolute, and implacable nature, by dreams and time. In this life we are faced with fant asy modules and rea lity modules. Each module is always ma de up of three elements: time, space, and the individual. As these three elements are combined, the person either is or is not. In order to understand this, we will construct the follow- ing image of the world: 1. A space apparently i mmutable and immobile. 2. A tape like that of a computer. This tape is divided into spaces, marked like a measur ing tape. Each degree corre sponds to a second, and th is system moves along the"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"74 THE STELLAR MAN immobile space at the speed of one de gree per second. (In this case, it does not matter whether the space or the time moves, all that matters is that one of them moves.) 3. Man standing upon the Earth (part of space), along the time band. We must realize that there are many time bands in the Universe, one for man, another for minerals, animals, plan- ets, galaxies, etc. For our purpose s, we are only interested in one, the time band for man. Suppose that this human time ba nd is moving at the rate of one degree per second, a nd that man is standing along- side this measure and must walk in step with it. Let us stop the system for a moment and ma ke a red mark on the tape, exactly in front of the man, and then start the system up again. To the extent that the man re mains on the red mark, he will live in reality, that is, the man IS. On the other hand, upon leaving the mark, either by going backward or forward with respect to it, the man IS NOT. Coincidence with time takes us toward the reality of our existence; a lack of this coincidence takes us toward an exis- tence of fantasy. Furthermore, it is necessary to add a missing element to complete this modu le. The missing ele- ment is the physical and ps ychological activity of the individual at a give n moment. The foll owing example illus- trates this: So-and-so, knowing the secret of time as explained here, reaches complete coincidence with time at this moment. What would his situation be? Let us suppose that his loca tion would be at the second"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"To B E OR N OT TO B E ? 5 degree of time (this is an imagin ary division). At this degree, it is 3:42 p.m., and our experi mental subject is in his down- town office. What is real fo r this individual? Only the space-time with which he is phys ically connected at that mo- ment. This is his prime reality— his office with all that it contains and the work he is doing at that moment. His house, his car, his family, and all that is apart from him at that moment exist only as a se condary reality. These are ele- ments with which the individua l will make contact in the near future, but which for the same reason, do not exist at that moment, as the only realit y is the present moment. Now, to the extent that the subject psychologically proj- ects his awareness toward a se condary reality or toward a fantasy (to what is not involved in his space-time at that mo- ment), the individual will no l onger coincide with time, and will unfailingly fall in to the power of dr eams, fantasy, and unreality. It is for this reason that it is dimly recognized that mental concentration is a powerful weapon for obtaining something of value. It is obvious that a person can only re- main in coincidence with time in direct relation to his self- discipline."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"76 THE STELLAR MAN If we could in some way ente r into coincide nce with cos- mic time, we would surely liv e thousands or millions of years; our age would be planetary, not human. The individual's great enemy is his \"psychological I\" which, as stated before, is like a fan opened to the past, pres- ent, and future, thus making it impossible to achieve actual temporal coincidence. The subject's imagination makes him project his aware- ness beyond the present moment, living thus an unreal and fantastic existence: not existing. We must understand that if a man lives in another time, he is not in relation to the present time. It is necessary to add some thing tremendously important and this is the fact that when one exists in coincidence with time, located in the reality of the present moment, one ob- tains the manifestation of th e spirit in the brain, thus succeeding in becoming spiritua l. Therefore, the secret of spirituality is the mystery of time and its influence on the human being. For the Hermeticist, pe ople have two ages: 1. Chronological age 2. Real age Chronological age is that which we all know. Real age is the sum total of all those tiny moments in which the spirit is manifested through the brain, and therefore has access to concrete material reality. For different reasons, some acciden- tal and others that can be attrib uted to the individual himself, the spirit has some corporeal manifestations. Nevertheless,"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"To B E OR N OT TO B E ? 77 these are so rare and brief in mo st people, that the real age of a forty-year-old person may only be six months, weeks, days, and at times, only hours. This re al age is obta ined by adding the spaces of time during wh ich the spirit was manifested, moments in which the person acquires, in spite of their brevity, an increase and el evation of his awareness. This reveals to us part of the methods empl oyed by Her- meticists in the spiritual deve lopment of students, because obtaining the manifestation of the spirit and maintaining this condition is inev itably a process of authentic evolution. Nevertheless, this is a long and painful process, as it in- volves the \"transubstantiation of the verb,\" that is, the verb or spirit should be converted into flesh and blood. This is what Jesus taught hi s disciples duri ng the Last Supper when he gave them br ead and wine saying: \"drink, for this is my blood, eat , for this is my body.\" Very few accept that this st atement is literal and not sym- bolic. The majority will not und erstand what has been said here in spite of the simplicity of the language. We write for a minority, but with the language of the majority, in order that everyone may have th e same opportunity. A reality module is composed of the following elements: 1.

The majority of peopl e live almost permanently entangled in the web of fantasy and dreams, which rob them of their best possib ility for achieving true consciousness and happiness. Although th is phenomenon is stated clearly and people are warned of this danger, only a small minority un- derstand their prec arious situation. Let us recall the wise words of Jose Ortega y Gasset in one of the paragr aphs from his book The Revolt of the Masses, when he says: All the matters about which sc ience speaks, whatever the science be, are abstract, and abstract things are always clear. So that the clarity of science is not so much in the heads of scientists as in the matters of which they speak. What is really confused, entangled, is the concrete vital re- ality, always a unique thin g.

Take stock of those around you and you will see them wandering about lost thro ugh life, like sleepwalkers in the midst of their good or bad luck, without the slightest suspicion of what is happening to them. You will hear them talk in precise terms about themselves and their sur- roundings, which would seem to point to them having ideas on the matter.

Quite the contrary: through these no-"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"To B E OR N OT TO B E ? 79 tions the individual is trying to cut off any personal vision of reality, of his very own life. For life is from the start a chaos in which one is lost. The individual suspects this, but he is frightened at finding himself face to face with this terrible reality, and tries to co ver it over with a curtain of fantasy, where everything is cl ear. It does not worry him that his \"ideas\" are not true, he uses them as trenches for the defense of his existence, as scarecrows to frighten away reality. The man with the clear head is the man who frees him- self from those fantastic \"ideas \" and looks life in the face, realizes that everything in it is problematic, and feels him- self lost. As this is the simple truth—that to live is to feel oneself lost—he who accepts it has already begun to find himself; to be on firm ground. Instinctively, as do the ship- wrecked, he will look around fo r something to cling to, and that tragic, ruthless glance, absolutely sincere, because it is a question of his salva tion, will cause him to bring order into the chaos of his life. These ar e the only genuine ideas; the ideas of the shipwrecked. All the rest is rhetoric, posturing, farce. He who does no t really feel himself lost, is inexorably lost; that is to say, he never finds himself, never comes up against his own reality. This is true in every order, even in science, in spite of science being in its nature an escape from life. (The majority of men of science have given themselves to it through fear of facing life. They are not clear heads; hence thei r notorious inep titude in the presence of any concrete situation.) Our scientific ideas are of value to the degree in which we have felt ourselves lost before a question; have seen its problematic nature, and have realized that we canno t find support in accepted no- tions, in prescriptions, in prove rbs, nor in mere words. The man who discovers a new scientific truth has previously had to smash to atoms almost everything he had learned,"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"80 THE STELLAR MAN and arrives at the new truth with hands stained with blood from the slaughter of a thousand platitudes. In a brilliant manner, alt hough profane and not Her- metic, Ortega y Gasset elucidat es the difficulty of finding clear heads as he called them, for man is lost beneath the su- perficiality of his own thought s and fantasie s, and never reaches the reality of life. Common man has never suspec ted the magnitude of his going astray in the world which surrounds him, as his fel- low man lacks orientation as mu ch or more than he himself does. Unfortunately, schools a nd universities of fer no guid- ance in this respect, least of all regarding ethical and moral codes, or through laws or rules instituted by so ciety. To be guides, they would ha ve to be designed by clear heads, which are certainly not abun dant. Nevertheless, and this has been seen repeatedly in history, clear heads occasionally will sud- denly appear and point out the road to be followed with a modicum of clarity. In general, people scorn such intelli- gence, as this is always the case with the ignorant who face something they do not understand, as a defense against showing their intellectual weakness. Our world is, at least for the moment, a planet of cripples who believe themselves to be perfectly healthy because they are unaware of any other condi tion. Nevertheless, the dam- age is not in their bo dies or intelligence, but in their lack of consciousness. But what is this consciousness we are referring to? Is it perhaps the differen ce between man and animals? Certainly not, al though logically a sapiens is much more con-"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"To B E OR N OT TO B E ? 81 scious than an animal whic h does not possess the divine spark. The awareness or consciousness to which we refer origi- nates with the exercise of an intelligence separated from dream-like states. On the other hand, unconsciousness or lack of awareness pervades the intelligence of a dormant subject and does not impede mechanical thought or the functioning of dead intelligence. The ideas we are endeavor- ing to explain are summarized in the following chart: 1. Unconsciousness: Intelligence born from an apprenticeship of dreams. The individual's leve l of awareness is very low, even though his intellect may be brilliant, since this acute- ness only reflects great dexterit y in arranging combinations of cerebral informati on. This is called dead or programmed in telligence. 2. Consciousness: Intelligence arising from and developed on the basis of an apprenticeshi p of awakeness. The individ ual's level of awareness is constantly high. We call this living or unprogrammed intelligence. Man might well be called a mental cripple. The term men- tal is only figurative, as sapiens has no mind, which we will explain later. Nevertheless, with the expression mental crip- ple, we wish to point out the weakness a nd inoperative state of the mind which, Hermetically speaking, is considered to be the highest faculty of the human being, but which he pos- sesses only in a dormant state. Due to the lack of a state of higher awar eness, the planet Earth is a small hell, where by divine grace or infernal evil, the individual neith er notices nor evaluates his precarious"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"82 THE STELLAR MAN condition or the cloudiness of hi s awareness. Like true mad- men, each sapiens, like Don Quixote, the Castilian nobleman, strikes out against his own wi ndmill. Thus, bat tle after bat- tle, youth is lost, illusions die, purity withers, and the last glimmers of lucidity gradually disappear. If we were perverse gods or immoral despoilers, we could not invent a better met hod to make a group of slaves work peacefully than to make them believe, by means of collective hypnosis, th at they are happy and important. We would then have perfect r obots who would work untir- ingly, producing what we desire. In addition, these robots would make and maintain themselves. It could be argued that sapiens, unlike other species, sows, produces, and labors only for himself and not for other beings. This is true for the products and material sapiens uses for his own maintenance. No non-human species steals the material product of sapiens' efforts. On the othe r hand, this is not the case with the subtle fruit produced by the human nerv- ous system in everyday life . This fruit is rapidly reaped by certain beings who are much higher on the evolutionary scale than the human being; veritable gods of space, who profit from human efforts, but in turn fulfill certain cosmic functions and occupy an important position in the univer- sal economy. These beings have been mentioned previously: they are the Archons of Destiny. We could also refer to them as Gods of th e Zodiac, as they direct and govern human existence on this planet.

All of Earth's i nhabitants are under the sway of one or more of these gods, who regulate, shape, and di- rect the destiny of humanity. But this is not so for the destiny of the Hermeticist, who attains his vital autonomy at a certain moment, releasin g himself from the mandate of the Archons. The Archons of Destiny are terrifying beings, not because they are evil, but due to their co ld and inexorable severity in the manipulation of sapiens. If we were to establish a symbol for these beings, no doubt they would be depicted with a whip in their hands, a girdle of bristles or netted wire with which they chastise humanity in order to ensure their progress, although this evolut ion may be imperceptible dur- ing our earthly time. For example these occult judges pitilessly provoke a wo rld war in which mi llions of people die. For them, these dead ar e of no more importance than that assigned by sapiens to the thousands of animals they sacrifice daily in order to feed. Sapiens, in his extreme fight for ex istence and in his vari- ous relations with the natural and soci al environments surrounding him, inevitably expe riences all kinds of tribula- tions, suffering, deceptions, and other experiences, both pleasant and unpleasant. As a consequence, his emotional and nervous systems develop certain embodied elements, that are extremely powerful, and which abandon the human body in the form of vibrations (everything vibrates; matter is only vibratory energy ).

It is thus that sapiens is unwittingly stripped of the most noble product he has produced; the final distillate of human experience, the broth in which lies the blood, the soul, and the very life of the individual . The individual lived for this, suffered, loved, enjoyed, worked, built things, went to war, studied, investigated, only to prepare the golden broth of his life. We must understand that the central computer only ex- ists in relation to th e Archons of Destiny as an instrument to control sapiens. The object of life, the reason for which sapiens was cre- ated, is not for him to enjoy lif e in the garden of the Lord, but rather to be a pa wn in his vineyards, a worker so perfect he can act as cultivator and food at the same time. If man could prevent his golden broth from being stolen, with this vital product he c ould become equal to the gods, rapidly evolving by integrating within himself the products from the chemical laboratory of his physical body.

This individ- ual, by virtue of his understanding and respon sibility, has no need for an overseer with whip in hand to oblige him to evolve through suffering, as he takes responsibility for his evolution into his own hands, and if he deems it necessary, submits himself to the same temporary suffering in order to attain eternal happiness.

Having a mind distinguishes the Hermeticist from the layman who, as we have seen in the last chapter, is a mental cripple. A The Hermeticist has a mind he himself has formed and developed, and this enables hi m to reach states of higher consciousness in which he has access to absolute truth. Physically, mind is a magnetic orb established between two poles: the brain (negative pole in man) and the sex (pos- itive pole in man). In women, the brain is the positive pole and the sex the negative. This orb is formed exclusively by the Hermetic student' s work on himself, and is the result of lengthy efforts. From a higher spiritual point of view, the mind is the philosopher's stone through which the initiate attains a continuous transforma tion of base metals (igno- 87"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"88 THE STELLAR MAN rance, lies) into gold (true knowledge) and the immortality of his own individuality. The mind is the stomach of intelligence. Lacking this, sapiens never digests the informati on he possesses, which de- velops into undigested in telligence. A glutton for knowledge, he devou rs information about many things, which is incorporated into the cerebral archive without ever releasing the quintessence of its secret. This immense mass of information possessed by a mo derately cultured individual is precisely what gives him th e false sensation of \"knowing many things.\" He f eels morally empowered to give all kinds of opinions, while remaining in ignorance of his mental dis- ability, which in the end, is a lack of intelligence. The more fame or prestige an author has, or the more lessons studied by the individual, the greater will be his intellectual blind- ness. If the individual has a professional titl e gained from long studies in univers ity classrooms, it is practically guar- anteed that his intelligence has been totally and incurably damaged by becoming stratified, or even petrified, at very low levels. The student does not assimilate his education due to an insufficient state of awareness. The student limits himself to memorizing and juggl ing infinite combinations of the data he possesses with acr obatics, which give him ex- traordinary intellectual agility, and absolute certainty of being very intelligent and extraordinarily capable in his pro- fession. Nevertheless, this tr eadmill of knowledge fails him lamentably when he is faced with practical situations in real life, except the application of mathematical concepts.

Man has been converted into the carrier of innumerable con- cepts which each day are more numerous and complex; but in the individual himself there is no change. From this we can recognize sapiens' ultimate vulnerability —his inability to apply the information he carries to his own transformation and evolution. This impossibilit y is so vast that the knowl- edge possessed does not al low him to see himself and evaluate himself impartially, effe ctively, objectively, and in a higher manner. It is a fact that the individual cannot see himself and, therefore, is full of false concepts about his own impor- tance, value, and capability. The most he can aspire to is to better the material conditions in which he lives, and guided by a subconscious impulse, end eavor to reach the stars with the secret hope of finding a superior galactic race which would teach him to live as a human being and enable him to leave his animal state. So it is that many people live with the hope that flying saucers are real, longing to meet extraterrestrial beings who can in some way help them to better themselves. As with all things in life, sapiens clings to far off hopes or illusions cre- ated to elude the real po ssibilities within his reach. It is much easier to dream of flying saucers or explore any kind of religious dogma than to dedicate oneself to the work of one's spir itual advancement. Sapiens is basically a loafer and as such, always seek s the easiest path and the least effort possible. He is fascinated by simple belief and ignorant faith, bedazzled by anything that can be acquir ed without ef- fort, either by act and grace of the Holy Spirit or by chance. Thus, sapiens creates all kinds of absu rd, subjective, illogical,"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"90 THE STELLAR MAN and arbitrary dreams. The cont ent of the dreams is not im- portant if he can cling to co nvenient illusions, just as the shipwrecked person clings to a board in order to save him- self. In search of this handhold, the frustrated person is converted to a religious faith and is able to thus free himself from an undesirable \"I.\" This satisfies a passion for individ- ual renunciation and allows him to disappear in the mass movement which he has entere d. Eric Hoffer, the great philosopher and thinker, refers to this when he says: \"faith in a holy cause is to a consider able extent a substitute for the lost faith in ourselves.\" With this strategy, the individual fully develops into a loafer, as he need not even th ink. He only needs to accept the religious dogma with which he has become affiliated with- out judgment or analysis. Only those who make efforts beyond duty and necessity are NOT loaf ers. People gener- ally live dreaming of some future event which will radically change their lives. It ma y be the expectancy of a stroke of luck which will make them millionaire s, finding a gr eat love, or the arrival of superior forces or causes which will mold their destiny into a happier state. Ne edless to say, this future illu- sion ruins or annuls all real and present intentions of attaining, by methodical and sustained efforts, whatever the individual desires. Sapiens is in truth a professional loafer, mainly because in his cerebral activity and in his conduct, he assiduously dopes himself with a dream drug.

It is much easier to fol- low those ideas which best justify the individual's temperament or way of life. For example, if a person is irre- sponsible, he will enthusiastically enter a religious or political movement which will free him from all responsibil- ity through his uncond itional surrender to a superior divine power; to a psychol ogical oneness with a group in which no one is responsible for anythi ng because it is anonymous. A cowardly person will choose a movement, which will de- prive him of the largest possible quantity of vital experiences, which are a threat to his mental or physical tranquility. Under the impulse of intellectual laziness, sapiens rapidly fills his brain with as much in formation as he is capable of absorbing and which he endeavor s to memorize as exactly as possible. In this way, he hopes to have prefabricated solutions for every situation that arises in his life, which he falls back on with lightn ing speed, without making any effort to ana- lyze the particular problem or co nflict he is facing. With this in mind, he rapidly and superfic ially absorbs all his studies, carrying out the process we call a dream appre nticeship (an ap- prenticeship in a low state of aw areness; zero . . . from the point of view of essential trut h). In this condition the individ- ual gives great importance to the prestige of the source of his information.

Due to his cerebral myopia, he will be incapable of visualizing the enor- mous magnitude of his ignorance and be limited to living within the \"egg\" of his own knowledge. Within his \"mental egg\" the individual is warm and com- fortable, completely free fro m danger of arguments and facts, which may oblige him to think, and perhaps reach a complete revision of his intellectual baggage. This man has already formed his mechanism of adaptation and defense and clings blindly to the concepts he knows and under- stands, which constitute his cu ltural lineage.

We know that the ps ychological personality is integrated more substantially when it starts from separate behavioral units.

People learn very much less than they believe from their experiences, as these are very frequently integrated into th e personality in the form of cliches and empty stereotype d symbols which do not con- tribute beneficially to the individual's awareness. They become fixed, empty rules for conduct, which the individual blindly follows without real discernment. The person seeks refuge in these programmed directives and hides behind them for protection, remaining comfortable and inert in ref- erence to anything that involves real intelligence. We call this assembly of protection and maintenance circuits the \"egg.\" Within this, man keeps his infa ntilism and lack of maturity intact, avoiding any traumati c shocks, which might result from facing new realities and lif e-challenging demands. It is for this reason that people automatically reject any new idea, which is not part of their cerebral program, no matter how valuable, or noble it may be. On the other hand, they accept, a priori, any suggestion which is a pparently in agreement with their beliefs, no matter how precariou s this may be in the light of a deeper analysis.

It is due to this that the wi sest and most illustrious men, clever at solving pr ofound scientific pr oblems, completely fail in their attempt to solve difficulties of a vital and practi- cal nature such as personal conflicts of an emotional nature, or understanding and wisely counseling their children.

There are typical solutions for all. Man today knows that he may face hunger, but it is improbable he will die of starvati on, which was a mass phenomenon in other ages. This relative security is pr ecisely that which encourages intellectual laziness , as the person is not pressured in any truly threatening manner.

The true sage , aware of absolute truths, has access to any of the relative truths when he so desires. Similar to the agnostics, Herm eticists maintain that gen- uine knowledge cannot be manufactured. They add something more important which is the intrinsic principle of Hermetic philosophy; the fact th at the impossib ility for the existence of genuin e knowledge is mainta ined only by spe- cial conditions in the consciousness of sapiens. However, if these conditions are altered and modified by Hermetic tech- niques, understanding will occur in the individual. This will gradually enable him to reach true knowledge. Thus the Fra- ternity of Magicians has been formed, possessors of knowledge and beyond good and evil; of knowledge which transcends all polarity or partiality. Of necessity, this science must be absolutely im partial and impersonal. The conceptual perspective of sapiens is built up to a great extent by his beliefs, for when man beli eves something with sufficient certainty, he conf ers on these beliefs the cate- gory of knowledge, wh ich in the majority of cases are only a reflection of his opinions, ho pes, likes, or dislikes. Naively, many thinkers and me n of science base all their hopes for the betterment of the human race on a major and massive development of sapiens' intelligence, believing in this way a certain kind of Para dise on Earth can be reached.

Some may say that Hermeticists believe themselves to be owners of the truth. From this point forward, we declare that no one has a monopoly on truth, but that we are the real pos- sessors of Hermetic Art as this is ours by spiritual aristocracy and not by blood. Spiritual aristocracy begins and ends with the individual, and is inherited only fr om oneself, from the person one has been in prev ious incarnations.

Reproaching those who ac- cept a certain idea in blind faith is justifie d, but at the same time it is correct to condemn th ose who reject an idea with- out rational analysis. To illustrate this proce dure so common among people, we will use the word anti-faith to describe an irrational belief in the opposite of what is being examined. This phenome- non certainly prevents all impart iality, which is the basis of deep and true reflection. It is harmful to have blind faith, but it is just as bad to have blind anti-faith. It is true that many men are champions of faith or anti- faith, but absolutely lack true intelligence (awareness). We maintain that only a brain in a complete state of alertness can gradually establish the basis from which a conscious, awakened, and unprogrammed intelligence can be born. This intelligence, due to its acuteness, can have access to genuine knowledge. Knowledge ha s many degrees, and to reach the highest degree requires a mystical process, but one which is in no way miraculous, but rather is logical and natu- ral. This justifies the use of the term illumination, as referring to full clarification of a spir itualized intelligence.

Nevertheless, actual reality shows us a dehumanized world with imitations of men who unconditionally serve matter, which mercilessly ab sorbs their vital energy. There is a strange symbiosis between matter and sapiens, in the sense that matter needs sapiens as sapiens needs matter. Thus, sapiens has, in spite of all we have said, a great differ- ence from the all-animal; he po ssesses the divine spark, placing him at a high er level than the animal. Although the strength of the divine spark ma y be dim in an individual, the spark provokes in hi m an important phe nomenon: the radia- tion of higher awareness, alt hough in a micros copic degree. Consciousness is the radiant ener gy of the divine spark or essence, and is a force which constantly surr ounds and is ir- radiated by man, in the same way that light and heat are given off by the sun. In this way, any pe rson will give off an energy similar to that of animal magnetism, but of a divine nature, or in other terms, this magnetism possesses a high vibration. The Hermeticist work s on this sma ll divine spark to make it grow in strength and power th rough the different phases of initiation. The uninitiated is similar to the light of a candle in his awareness. On the other hand, the initiate, according to his degree of development, can reach a likeness to the sun.

An artist concen- trates his awareness on his work, and this force is that which brings about a special experien ce and transmits an energy which impresses our psyche favorably or negatively. A master carpenter or cabinetmaker puts his soul into his work whether he wishes to do so or not, as this is inevitable. Thus sapiens works giving consciousness to matter; that is, spir- itualizing or giving subtlety to denseness. Consider who might capitalize on this force and profit from this phenomenon. Still, as sapiens accomplishes this entirely unconsciously, it cannot be said that this is an independent vol untary act; it is more something which happens because it is thus decreed or programmed. Due to this ignorance, instead of man being owner and master of matter, matter subjugates man, extract- ing his conscious energy, wh ich by impregnating the elemental bodies becomes incorporated into them. Conscious energy has some in trinsic properties, and oth- ers that are contingent on the result of fusion with a specific person. This is explained in the following examples: 1. Conscious Energy: Is pure and chaste in itself. It constitutes the body of God. An infinitesimal fraction of this emanated from the Supreme Creator and took a body in a specific person. 2. Incarnated Awareness: Being incarnated in a certain individ ual, this ener gy, which is pure and ch aste in itself, is modified according to the indi vidual's basic vibratory tone, culture, self-control, discipline, and behavior. On becoming incarnated, the conscious energy in Exam- ple 2 can follow two paths:"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"100 THE STE LLA R MAN A. Superior Incarnated Awareness: This exists in an infinitesimal portion of the human race. Pure spiritual and chaste con scious energy acquires, thro ugh the intellig ent experience of the individual, the noti on of good and evil—the human knowledge, which exists on ly in a material body. This essence, therefore, reaches the human intelligence, preserving di vine intelligence. In this case the higher purpose in the life of man is accomplished. B. Inferior Incarnated Awareness: This exists in the great human mass. Conscious energy is blemished and degraded as its superior nature is corrupted by slavery to a perverted beast, due to the deviated intelligence of sapiens who is blind and ignorant, and who lives only to satisfy his own instincts. This awareness, still high in itself, becomes \"inferior\" in its manifestation, radiating an energy \"stained\" by the indi vidual's base passions, impulses, and tendencies. In his day-to-day existenc e, the individual imbues his material possessions with his conscious energy. When that energy inadvertently separates from him, it acts independ- ently with its own intelligence, which has been taken from the individual. This intelligence gives tone and color to pure awareness. Since each person has impulses, fears, desires, ambitions, and sentiments whic h manifest themselves as un- controlled passions, this force im prints a directive onto the conscious energy a nd becomes an absolu tely uncontrollable path for the individual from th e moment this force leaves him to become incorporated into any material structure.

Actually, these book s have endeavored to hint at certain ideas in or der to make their re aders think and very gradually prepare them for more complex designs. At times, reality is disguised as fiction in order that there should be no opposition from the masses, who ob stinately refute all things not forming part of the ort hodox cultural reco rds of human- ity. The truth is that this phenomenon exists and no one is free from it. The machine has turn ed into a monster that is not going to devour man, because it is already doing so. For example, the automobile is of great use to its owner, but we must ask ourselves who drives who, who is the owner and who is the servant? Is it the au tomobile who carries its owner as an obedient slave, or is it the owner who must work long hours to feed and maintain his car and drive it in order to ful- fill the reason for its existence: driving over the roads at great speed devouring the Eart h's blood, petroleum? As another example, let us observe those who have pets, such as a dog, and how people work to maintain and keep them like their own ch ildren. Many times a sapiens can be seen pulling a dog tied to a chain, and we can ask ourselves who is leading whom. With dom estic animals, conscious en- ergy explains the mysterious affinity between a dog and his master and how they, due to unexplainable circumstances, acquire an amazing likeness which at times is limited only to rules of conduct, but at othe r times goes as far as physical likeness.

On some occasions the cons cious energy displaced by the individual takes body in a mach ine which belongs to him, and then reacts destructively against its owner because his passions are indiscriminately destructive. The story of Dr. Frankenstein is symbolic of this explanation and it must be noted that emanated awareness is a virtua l child of the man from which it originat ed. Many times there are persons who are destroyed by their own wo rks and not by any karmic re- action of their acts. The passiona te or destructive force they generated endeavors, in its unconscious manife station, to destroy its own father. Something very similar occurs with children of the flesh who, from the earliest age, develop all kinds of bad habits, tantrums, whims, or hysterical crying bouts when their wishes are not immediately gra tified. We cannot blame these creatures as they are only giving way to the defects incorpo- rated in them by their sire s through incarnation of their consciousness. All the defects not controlled by their parents, all hidden tendencies of an instinctive type, take form in the children. It is due to th is that the Bible says: \"the sins of the fa- thers will be visite d upon the children.\" Subsequently, the parents find that they cannot control or guide their children, but on the contrary, many times it is the children who exer- cise veritable tyranny on the authors of their days.

Continuing the commentary on machines, we can point out the extraordinary influence the operat or has over a com- puter, which becomes very sensitive to the vital state and conditions of the operator. This occurs because the machine becomes impregnated with the co nscious energy of the oper- ator, which then acts independently, but following the basic directives of the opera tor's vibratory states. We can also point out a phen omenon affecting all drivers and truck owners that is base d on their clos e identification with the vehicle, which is a source of work and subsistence. I refer to the strange reacti ons these machines may have under certain circumstances, producing all kinds of ab- solutely illogical and incredible mechanical defects. In some cases, this reaction reaches the point where the owner of the machine is ruined. Th ere is also the case of machines that have had an accident or col lision, and when the owner or driver is changed, the accident is repeated with practically the same characteristics. The case of doomed jewels that bring bad luck to their owners, to the extent that they inexorably suffer violent death, is well known. All this can be explained by the \"in- visible child\" (consciousness) which inhabits material objects, and which was created by one of the owners of the object, or perhaps by the one who made it. The same thing happens with firearms, which, after having caused death, become dangerous as they ar e impregnated with the vibra- tions of the tragedy and of the person who caused it.

We will conclude this subject by citing the case of plants and flowers, as it has been proven that they are extremely sensitive to the influence of their owners consciousness, caretakers, or whoever is fre quently near them. Any person with love for a plant or a tree , and who talks to them as if speaking to a person , will be able to witness the extraordi- nary increase in the beauty , health, and vitality of the specimen. Since this entire subject has been elaborated to explain the impossibility of real knowl edge under the condition of ordinary awareness, we wish to point out the enormous power of matter upon sapiens.

This is also the basis for the vegetarian system, and although there is much to be said about this, anyone who has abstained fr om meat for some time will prove that his thoughts have become noticeably clearer. The conscious energy radiated by the masses affects the individual in a hypnotic manner, since this imposes the in- fluence of a different vibratio n on him, which then impels him to act according to its particular vibration. A gift given to us due to a social obligati on by someone wi th evil inten- tions can negatively influence our health, intelligence, and destiny. Summing up, sapiens permanently lives in a somnambu- listic condition which keep s him dormant, making it impossible for him to attain real knowledge, and seriously damaging his awareness and in telligence. Each day what he knows increases at the cost of his human essence, which is reduced in direct relationship to the extent and potency of his cerebral programming. This programming converts him into a veritable biological robot with automatic physiological, instinctive, emotional, and intellectual reactions.

As an argument against what has been stated in the pre- vious pages, it could be said that \"come what may, the individual does as he pleases\" and that this freedom really proves he is not under control of any kind by forces outside himself. Precisely, one of the things that gives sapiens a sen- sation of power is the illusion of freedom. To prove this freedom, the adolescent rebels against the rules of behavior imposed by society, believing that he is proving his inde- pendence, when really the onl y thing he accomplishes is submission to his own unconscious impulses. O Freedom has many aspects, and we speak therefore of private or personal freedom, pu blic freedom, social freedom, freedom of action, words, an d ideas, moral freedom, and economic freedom.

We are not interested in fa shioning an orthodox philo- sophical analysis, dwelling on what has been said by so many thinkers in the past. Inst ead, we wish to reflect upon the vital reality of sapiens. Sapiens believes in his personal independence due to the fact that at any moment he may, if he so desires, violently break any of the bonds which imprison him without any im- pediments. It is possible for him, if he so desires, to leave the work which imprisons him and live as a vagabond on other people's charity. Or, he can abandon those studies which are so arduous and look for a job or live as he can. If he under- takes any of these measures of \"freedom,\" he knows he will have to pay for them, but cons iders the price cheap for doing as he pleases. The best proof of this apparent independence can be inferred by th e reader, who imagines that at any time he can, by a volunt ary act, quit readi ng this book once and for all. All these reflections suggest the possession of a force we could call \"power for doing things,\" something of which sapiens feels extremely proud. Consciousness, intelligence, will power, and freedom constitu te the mythological quater- nary of the human race, which considers these talents as equal to the holy teaching that designates them as human be- ings. Not for a moment do peopl e have any doubt that they really are the possesso rs of these gifts. In order to duly illustrate this chapter on freedom, we will"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"T HE I LLUSION OF F REEDOM 109 form a ternary with the words freedom, will power and desire, as these are intimately related to the subject of our interest. Before continuing, it is necessa ry to clarify the objective of this work. In its attempt to enlighten in a clear and open manner, it could rightly be calle d anti-Hermetic. It was writ- ten for all those who aspire to accomplish something in a real and effective way on the pa th of their own spiritual de- velopment. For this goal to be realized, it is vitally important that the individual should know, in depth, his true internal nature and his real position on the vital scale of values. To the degree that sapiens is full of illusions about himself and his life, his spiritual fulfillment becomes impossible, becom- ing only the beautiful dream of a well-meaning person. The world is full of mirages of this nature which end up being nothing more than devices used by people to avoid the real- ity that troubles them. There is no field more likely than esotericism to generate all kinds of fantasies by intellects anxious to avoid crude reality. In facing reality, there is the great disadvantage that the indi vidual must suffer all kinds of sacrifices and make efforts in order to attain his purpose, and this is certainly arduous and difficult. It is much easier for the loaf er to stay dr eaming without making any effort or taking a risk of any kind, because in dreams everything is possible an d there is no danger of fac- ing arduous, conflicti ng, or traumatic si tuations. For these people, occultism is the real \"open sesame\" which enables them to drug themselves with the illusion of perfection and spiritual progress, which only ex ists in their imagination, stimulated by unconsci ous desires and fears. Generally, the seeker of esoter ic doctrines only wishes to"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"110 THE STE LLA R MAN find an ideological system wh ich justifies his own defects and stimulates his hidden dreams, although this system may be absurd and patently subjective or childish. We can assert that sapiens only understands what he wishes to understand, or more accurately, that which is con- venient. He absolutely discredits everything that affronts his cerebral guidelines or his habits of life and conduct. This is perhaps one of the greatest obst acles facing th e student of Hermeticism or the neophyte who aspires to be a disciple. To analyze objectively an d without prejudice requires a flexible and open disposition so as not to limit oneself and discredit what is being studied, without a prior alert and deep reflec- tive process. Still, however much an individual strive s, he will not be successful if he has too high an opinion of himself or his own intelligence and knowledge. It is sufficient for someone to believe he is very intelligent, cultured, or wise, to refrain from thinking impartially, limiting himself to a superficial examination of concepts and very frequently taking from these only the emotional or sy mbolic content. Vanity and pride are two bandages which blind sapiens, preventing him from seeing what would be evident to an awakened, impar- tial, or impersonal observer. Symbolically, we could visualize sapiens as a personage who has inflated himself, and this condition impels him to float in the air toward higher re gions, but only in relation to the distance from the ground. From the clouds he contem- plates the world and believes hi mself to be the most wise and perfect being in creation. Unfortunately, while he re- mains in this limbo, he will also be far removed from vital"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"T HE I LLUSION OF F REEDOM 111 and everyday reality. The first step taken by the student of Hermeticism, or of esotericism in general, is to really put his feet on the ground and proceed, despite the pain, with his own deflation until he reaches his real level. He will hope- fully reach the lowest point possible, as there is no other starting point except from zero . If one has not started from zero, it is a false st art and therefore, corrupt. The student must live the experience of entirely understa nding his own insignificance and incredible smallness in face of the immen- sity of the Universe. As we have already stated in previous pages, the individ- ual must \"appreciate the magnitude of his ignorance,\" as only the immense humility caus ed by this experience can lead the individual, along with powerful reasoning and ade- quate alertness, to the psyc hological conditi ons which are necessary for him to understa nd what Hermeticism is and the far-reaching truths involved. If this state of humility has not been reached and there is still pride and strong self-es- teem, together with a destru ctive internal nature, it is improbable that an individual wi ll ever gain any spiritual benefit from Hermetic science. It is for this reason that we are endeavoring in this book to have the individual see him- self as he really is and not as he believes himself to be. The student must not accept these concepts with the blind faith of a believer or a convert. On the contrary, such concepts must be shaken countless times in the sieve of serene and unprejudiced meditati on during a state of intensified alert- ness. Afterwards, one must not be content with this procedure, but prove this teach ing in everyday life, observ- ing his own experience and that of others."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"112 THE STE LLA R MAN In the practice and study of He rmeticism there is a neces- sary order which must be comp lied with for the student to reach his goal. Regarding this pr ocess, we urge the reader to make the greatest effort to understand this book. There are three basic stages to be fulf illed in order to be successful: 1. Motivation 2. Understanding 3. Practice The result is evolution. These are the three indispensa ble steps for th e student to attain his goal. His motivation must be powerful; his under- standing, deep; and his practice, intense. The result of all this is the evolution of the student. Yet what at first sight seems so simple is arduous and comp lex to accomplish. The stu- dent generally fails at one of the stages and evolution does not take place. Many times th e student reaches the following result: 1. Motivation 2.________ 3. Practice The result is stimulat ion of mass energy and there is no evolution. In this case, the individual is carried away by his enthu- siasm and skips over the second point, di rectly proceeding to practice. It is also possible, and this is very common, that his own inability to understand impels him to evade this stage. The result will then be a \"stimulation of mass en-"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"T HE I LLUSION OF F REEDOM 113 ergy,\" that is, corporeal euph oria, but without the desired result, evolution. We must realize the fund amental importance of pro- found understanding on the path of Hermeticism, as this is not a footpath of faith and se lf-conviction. Without authen- tic understanding, nothing real is gained, only subjective illusions. Frequently the following situation occurs: 1. Motivation: poor 2. Understanding: insufficient 3. Practice: scant The result is insignificant evolution. Occasionally a person's understanding and practice reach acceptable levels but motiv ation is deficient. In this case the individual la cks the fuel necessa ry to successfully reach his spiritual goal. Having understood this, let us analyze the triangle of the words Freedom, Will Power, and Desire. In the first place, sapiens is ambivalent in relation to free- dom; he desires and fears it si multaneously. Generally, he desires it physically and fears it psychologically. Sapiens wants his physical, political, and economic freedom and he desires total freedom of action to accomplish his personal aims. In the end, this longing represents an immeasurable yearning for power, in that he wishes to be free enough to be able to exercise hi s power over people and within his envi- ronment. Following his desire for freedom, he endeavors by all means within his re ach to attain physical, ideological, and"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"114 THE STELLAR MAN economic independence. In oppos ition to this, however, and obeying his ancestral fear of individual responsibility, he merges into religious, cultural , and political systems within which he dissolves his own \"I,\" thus becoming free from the responsibility of his ow n decisions and actions. From another point of view, freedom is understood as a lack of opposition to individual actions or tendencies, thus making it possible for the indi vidual to accomplish his pur- poses, whatever these may be. It is for this reason that many individuals seek their freedom by means of su ccessful eco- nomic negotiations, alleging th at money makes them free and powerful. Yet, sapiens' approach leaves out one truly important con- sideration in this aspect, a fact or which in practice acts as a veritable jailer, and at times as the executioner of the indi- vidual. We refer to the intern al nature of man; to his emotions, instincts, and passion s, which are really his mas- ters. The only possible freedom in this life is freedom from one's own passions, because as l ong as they dominate us, we will be mere puppets who obey the ebb and flow of the pas- sionate states of the masses. All independence is impossibl e while thinking and feel- ing according to the influenc e of the environment on our internal nature. Whatever e xperience of freedom we may have had will disappear in the face of the primitive force of our animal soul which dominates us. Freedom does not depend on the individual's physical conditions; the pris oner in his cell can be more autonomous than a person who is very ri ch and has freedom of move- ment. The only true freedom is li beration of one's self and"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"T HE I LLUSION OF F REEDOM 115 liberation from the central computer of the species. As long as this has not taken place, it is possibl e to be a great politician, a fa- mous multimillionaire, have glory, honor, and power, but still be as much or more of a slave than the poorest man. We invite the astute reader to analyze himself and estab- lish what decisions he has made absolutely freely in his life, without being compelled by either external or internal pres- sures which oblige him to act in a certain way, or not solely because he had no other alternative, or not merely following the line of least resistance. Of course, these are not decisions made freely, independently, and voluntarily, but are instead equivalent to things, which happen to the individual inde- pendently of his wishes. From the time we reach the age when we can make decisions, it will be noted that one de- cides to follow a certain career through imitation, qualification, or ambition. One marries due to loneliness, sexual desire, lack of love, or personal convenience, but not free will. To choose freely im plies a decision independent from internal and external pr essure, behaving impartially and objectively, carefully weighing the pros and cons, then deciding what it is we really wa nt and to what extent this may be favorable or harmful, and what degree of compati- bility there is between our plan and family and social interests. We have now arrived at the se cond word of our triangle: Will Power, which is ultimately the ke y that may shed more light on the problem under discussion. Th e capacity to choose and make decisions i nvolves the possession of ma- ture judgment manifested th rough will power, and this quality must be central to our lives. To be free we must be"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"116 THE STE LLA R MAN capable of voluntarily deciding our existence. Nevertheless, it is here that will po wer is confused with desire, the third word of our triangle. It is necessary to recognize that the human being does not move by the impulse of his will power, but by the strength of his desire, which is in turn motivated and conceived by pr evailing instincts or emo- tions. To have Will Power implies the possession of a powerful, stable, and mature \"Superior I.\" The will permits maintaining a constant line of action, which does not occur in practice, as the individual constantly changes his center of gravity or his \"directing I.\" As Gurd jieff so aptly states, \"Man has no \"I,\" but many \"I's\" which, in re ality, possess him, instinctively and anarchically, in a passionate manner.\" For this reason sapi- ens rapidly changes his mind as well as his way of thinking and feeling. From th is is born enormous internal contradic- tions, disorientation, doubt, and instability . What stability can there be if we ch ange every minute? As sapiens uncon- sciously realizes this phenome non, he creates the most rigid intellectual plans possib le in order to cling to them, thus ob- taining the semblance of stability. It does not matter that the \"directing I\" is acting as th e master of our \"biological house\" (the physical body); the inte llectual plan will tell us what we must do. This is one of the reasons why sapiens pet- rifies his intelligence, limiting hims elf to an assembly of fixed, stable, and permanent circuits. This has some advan- tages, but they are insignificant in the face of the negative factors this implies. It may be true that petrification is useful to the individual in attaining greater emotional or intellec- tual stability, or adjustment to the group to which he belongs. On the other hand, petrification converts the indi-"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"T HE I LLUSION OF F REEDOM 117 vidual, metaphorically speaking , into a \"tree of stone,\" rigid, inflexible, a nd static, depriving him of the dynamics of transformation. While the world changes, this individual clings to his worn out plan, refusing to co nsider the importance and far- reaching effects of these transformations. Without a grown-up and matu re \"Superior I,\" man has no real will; the force of the unknown and unexpected im- pels him towards a complete ly unknown goal which was not chosen by him. Sapiens is an eternal wanderer toward the unknown and completely ignor es the happiness or tragedy of his future. A premonition of this impels him to \"enjoy life\" in a compulsive manner, system atically searching for today's pleasures as he is unsure about tomorrow; he is a being without a future, at least in his choices. Under these condi- tions the materialistic and purely selfish attitude of sapiens is, to a certain extent, und erstood and forgiven. Sapiens tries by all means within his reach to make his em pty and inert inter- nal world vibrate. In this pursuit he often prefers useless suffering to internal peace. Lacking a \"Superior I,\" sapiens tenaciously takes refuge in a \"Collective I,\" which is projected into the individual, directing his life. In previous chapters, we have referred to this \"I\" as the Collective Soul or Central Computer of the species. It is thus that custom s, norms, and the collective ap- proval or rejection of certain guidelines for conduct masters the individual, and in the end alienates him completely. All men who seem to have an or iginal and successful attitude toward life are rapidl y imitated by the ma sses who, without further thought, superficially adopt their ways without"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"118 THE STE LLA R MAN looking beneath the surface. Mo vie stars and singers bring about an imitative mania as th ey project a grand image, while the \"gray men\" endeavor to possess that image in order to become outstanding. There are few people who act authentically, following their own internal impulses, appe aring as they really are; the majority constantly seek the appr oval of others to justify and reinforce their way of being. A characteristic custom of nearly everyone is to frequently observe the facial expres- sion of people with whom they come into contact in order to verify whether their faces show approval or rejection, and to modify their attit ude accordingly. The masses, in turn, constan tly seek leaders to follow. This is the real recognition of the fact th at their volition is void; they need someone to follow as they lack the will power to direct themselves. The leader is always a symbol of the man who is strong, daring, free, and has the determina- tion, which is lacking in the common man. We definitely deny the concept of sapiens' free will, and maintain that in trut h and according to the oriental concept, \"all is written.\" Sapiens occupies a specific level within the cosmic order, and for him all is predetermined and foreseen. Nevertheless, we must not take this concept in an absolute, blind, and definitive manner. It is indispensable to interpret the concept in the sense that a person is limited to the possi- bilities offered by the Lords of Destiny or Zodiacal Gods. However, these beings do not impel the individual along a one-way path, but in stead there are detours on the path which present a choice, but alwa ys within the structure im- posed on him."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"T HE I LLUSION OF F REEDOM 119 Though it may be true that for sapiens \"all is written,\" this is not true fo r the wise man who has freed himself from the collective animal soul and has been converted into a stellar man.

Sapiens cannot direct his life to whatever he really wants; he has to limit himself to being carried away on the ocean of collective \"progress\" whose ebb and flow is determined by the Lords of Destiny. So the greatest civilizations are born through much blood, sweat, and tears, just so one day the pendulum will swing to the other extreme an d rapidly destr oy everything, leaving only ruins, traces, an d memories.

For this reason we can corr ectly call Hermeticism the Science of all Sciences. From ancient times until now, Hermetic science has not been lost or weakened, but rema ins in all its purity, although many pseudo-philosophical mys tifications have arisen which have been transformed into systems based on Her- meticism, but which lack true knowledge. In our age, Hermeticism is fully active and continues to give man the opportunity to esca pe from his cosmic classifi- cation and to rise to an infini tely higher level: the level of man, that is, of the creature in whom the highest human qualities are manifested, which sapiens definitely lacks. This prodigious passage requires the authentic mutation of sapi- ens who, if successful in the process, will forever abandon his terrestrial condition to convert himself into a Stellar Man. This is not an abst raction or a symbol, but an absolutely real, true, concrete, and tangib le possibility. However much we study the marvels of Nature, or the wonders of science and technology, there does not exis t, nor will there ever exist, a marvel such as what we are pointing out: the metamor- phosis of the human larva into a Stellar Man.

It is possible to be a stra nger on your own planet , but as superior beings, living a simple and anonymous life. Insignificant men continually strive to call attention to themselves; the truly important endeavor to pass unnoticed. The \"invaders\" or \"aliens,\" as the hypothetical visitors from the stars have be en called, are not a bout to arrive; they have been here since the remo te era of Lemuria, anonymous and entirely mixed with the cr owd. These men have always been the light of humanity. Like Prometheus, they carry the divine flame in their hands, li ghting, inspiring, and helping terrestrial men who are in a me re larval state of evolution. What do these Stellar Men do? To what do they dedicate their time? They do the same work as ordinary men, since they must earn their daily bread, because their superior con- dition does not free them from the responsibility of labor.

The rest labor in other work s, which in this case cannot be divulged. Continuing this explanation, there are two kinds of Stel- lar Men: those who originally arri ved from outer space and continued their evolution on th is planet, and those who by Initiation were transformed in to mutants and reached the qualification of Stellar Man due to the elev ation of their awareness. The most recent manifestation of Hermeticism in the past occurred in Egypt with the \"M aster of Masters,\" Hermes Trismegistus (the three times grea t), in an era no t able to be determined historically. Traditio n tells us that this Master reached our planet Earth thir ty thousand years ago. Her- metic philosophy derived its na me from the teachings of Hermes, who was a perfect heir and follower of the early Masters. We must understand that be fore Hermes, Hermetic sci- ence must have been called by another name, but this is not important as words are only symbols which can change many times while the designated object remains the same in its own nature. During the course of history, Hermetic sci- ence adopted many names but remained constant in its internal nature. The most known Hermeticists were the early Rosicrucians (not those who cu rrently carry this name) who"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"H ERMETICISM 125 adopted a series of explanatory symbols in order to facilitate the transmission of th e teaching to students. It must be said that if in fact a few true Rosicrucians exist today, no one knows about them. The Hermeticists, whether they be Rosicrucians, magi- cians, initiates, Masters, wizards, etc., are not grouped into one \"Hermetic Order\" or \"Rosic rucian Order,\" but they are scattered throughout the worl d, each one independent, in spite of working within a common plan. A Stellar Man may be an eminent politici an, a priest, a schoolm aster, an author, a screen star, a soldier, an artis an, or any thinker. Each one of these knows exactly what he is doing in his job. These men do not act as master instructors. The Ma sters of wisdom are generally in charge of a school for Hermetic instruction, but as stated before, ther e are few of these men. When we speak of Hermetic philosophy, many people be- lieve that it is an abstract an d theoretical discipline, a mere exercise of thought, which gives not hing practical to the individual. Traditional philosophy offers an immense range of reflec- tions on innumerable problems which concern sapiens. The great philosophers who existed in the history of humanity are today the pillars of civilized thinking. Apparently, there is little more to be added to what has already been stated in this respect. For this reason, speaking of Hermetic philosophy does not disturb or stir anyone. We must state th at we do not endeavor in any way to call atte ntion to ourselves, cause sen- sationalism, or to proselytize; we only wish to tell something to the world so that according to its inhabita nts ability to think, they may understand the rudiments of Hermetic Art,"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"126 THE STE LLA R MAN or deny them, make fun of them , or merely shrug their shoul- ders.

If their mess age is heard, they rejoice with the promise of a new dawn for sapiens; if they are not un- derstood or appreciat ed, they will lament for those who will be deprived of such a beautif ul and remarkable opportunity. Stellar Men are not very concerned with the passage of time, as they are immortal in their intrinsic na ture. They may be transformed many times, su ffering the process we call death, but beyond this they re tain their conscious identity and the memory of their knowle dge, returning each time to physical existence as one who awakens from a healthgiving sleep. It is sapiens who should be concerned about time, as the brevity of his ex istence as a thinking identity obliges him to work rapidly if he wish es to be converted into a Stellar Man and attain immortality. Many ask how it is that Hermeticism remains so un- known if it is really so im portant. Others will identify Hermetic philosophy with yoga, occultism, mentalism, para- psychology, spiritualism, demonology, or black magic, etc., believing that there is no Hermetic secret, despite the abun- dant literature which exists on this subject. It should be known that Hermeticism has not spread beyond the true schools, as it is an art whose knowledge can only be attained in a special state of conscious ness which, if not reached, makes all study in this resp ect hollow and empty talk.

Conversely and distinct from traditional philo sophy, Hermeticism is some- thing deeply vital. The indi vidual must face the different transformations through whic h man passes during his earthly existence in order to take advantage of the teaching in a practical manner , as Hermetic philos ophy is the art of living, not taught in any unive rsity or school. The student must take possession of Herm etic wisdom by the sweat of his brow, getting to know life at its roots, passing through as many experiences as possible, enlightened by what he has truly learned, enabling him to develop himself into a true Hermetic sage and a Stellar Man. Hermeticism is the only living philosophy, the only knowl- edge which is idea, concept, fl esh, blood, and spirit. As it is flesh and blood (recall Jesus at the Last Supper), it constantly renews itself; it is dynamic, flexible, and eternally young. Hermeticism is the achievement of wisdom as a living philosophy. It is the universal and di vine spirit, transubstanti- ated into a body of living matter. There is no \"Hermetic mold,\" die, or matrix which could serve as a model to produce Stellar Men according to an es- tablished pattern. On the contrary, each one of these men is truly unique. It is for this reas on that Hermetic philosophy is not taught in the traditional manner which sapiens is accus- tomed to, for in traditional st udy success is guaranteed to the most studious or intelligent.

It would be a violation of this science itself, which simply stated, seeks freedom, independence, and the free will of man. It is difficult for a person to understand how it is possible to \"teach without teaching, \" how to conv ey knowledge without a programmed and methodical instructional process. The answer is simple. In the initiatic process the stu- dent is placed before very pe culiar, vital conditions in order that he may, with a self-ta ught criteria, \"create his own knowledge,\" the basis of which is given to him in oral in- structions of a very special na ture, and in a mystic process we could call mental osmosis. To tell the truth, Hermeticis m recognizes no other possi- bility of real learning aside from self-taugh t knowledge in which it is the subject himself who is teaching himself, hav- ing received basic information from a teacher or simply from the written word. The educatio nal system used in schools and universities suffers from a serious defect: it programs the student according to rigid plans engraved in his brain by force of the prestige and authority of these establishments.

As a general orientation on ly, the reader should reflect upon the relationship between the specific and the general, and on the popular saying that \"nothing is true or untrue, all is according to the color of the glass through which it is seen.\" Truly, only by rising above the many facets of truth is it possible to know absolute tr uth, which summarizes in it- self what is and what is not , truth and falsehood, good and evil, ignorance and wisdom, life and death. We also wish to refer to the koans used in Zen Buddhism as an example of what we are saying. The koan is a type of symbolic dialogue be tween a Master and his disciple. The Master sets up a question wh ich cannot be solved intellectu- ally because it is beyond reason. This method is an attempt to destroy and surpass conceptu al thought in order to reach the essential and unique nature of all things. Hermeticism says \"all is mind\" (the word mind has been chosen to designate the unique energy of the Universe, but another could be used, such as spirit) and that the nature of the Universe is mental. In th is way, the profound nature of all that exists would be comprised of mind energy. The atom is mind; man is mind; God is mind.

Naturally, each school proclaims that its truth is correct, and that those similar to it are imperfect or spurious. It is not our intention to criticize the different schools, but rather to guide seekers so they may find what they seek and at the same time obtain more insight into their personal motives.

In turn, wi thin each of these currents there are numerous schools and \"pseudo- schools.\" The candidate for init iation finds it difficult to choose appropriately. In the first place, we may sa y that each individual has his own level within the general aver age of humanity. It is as if we all lived in a water tank, similar to an aquarium, and each person found his own level of flotation according to the density of his body. Ther e are many kinds of sapiens; there are those who are very low and others who are very high for their species. Under these cond itions, it is natural that each person should seek an adequate movement or school appro- priate to his own level; ot herwise he would find it impossible to gain an y benefit. In this case, it is understood that \"like attracts like.\" As an example, let us suppose a very low or dense indivi dual arrives at a hi gh level school, at- tracted by the goal he seeks. W ith absolute cer tainty, this individual will consider this in stitution bad or deficient as his concept of badness will be all that is beneath or above his own level. For him, \"good\" will be that which is suitable to his own vibration. Following this analogy of a level of flotation, those of dense vibration find it practica lly impossible to remain in high level initiatic groups, and must resign themselves to others of a lower category. It must be stated that all schoo ls are of use, even those of a low level, for if it were no t for them, ther e would be none which could cope with individuals of infe rior quality, who also need a light equal to thei r capabilities in order to see.

To be a disciple of Jesus, it was necessary to attain the level of an Apostle; it was not possible any other way. It is most important to state that true schools are very scarce, and the majority of these are only centers of study and practice of elementary prin ciples. As an explanation we will divide these school s into three groups: 1. Study centers. These comprise the great majority. 2. Schools connected to a superior occult force. These are ex tremely scarce. 3. Schools of initiation. These schools teach the mystical process of initiation in a real, and not symbolic, manner. They are extremely scarce and virtually unknown. In practice, any person can enter th e study centers as mentioned in the firs t point. It is sufficient to pay the dues and to attend regularly, or ma intain constant communication in the case of instruct ions by correspondence. It is useful for a person to belong to one of these study centers as they prepare the in dividual for highe r things, and at the same time awaken in him greater spiritual restless- ness. We could say that these groups represent the exoteric or external side of Hermetic doctrine. Under the second point, we find the school s which are actually linked to a higher pow er, that is, in some manner they are connect ed with the Stellar Men. The student can get a lot of benefit from these schools."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"134 THE STE LLA R MAN Under the third point, we ha ve the initiatic schools which are the only ones that can truly lead the student through the process of initiation in a real and not symbolic manner. These schools are characterized by a leading Master, and are the bearers of the celestial fire , which is transmitted to the student during initiation. It is essentia l to establish that initi- ation is not, as some naive pe ople believe, a ritual ceremony practiced in a te mple. The word initiation designates the en- tire process of mutati on of the human larva into a Stellar Man, which is brought about and directed by the Masters of these schools. Physically, where are these schools of initiation located? Their location is not important , because in spite of the fact that their number is very small, all candidates who truly and powerfully yearn for spirit ual superiority and have the capacity for it will su rely find someone to guide them to one of these \"workshops.\" We must now speak of candidates for wisdom. We know there are individuals who have gone thro ugh every existing school searching for what they desire, but have never found it, probably beca use they do not know what they really want. They generally have the most fantastic ideas in this re- spect and honestly believe that the only true Masters are in India or in some mysterious and inaccessible place in the East. Others believe that it is necessary to communicate with flying saucers by tele pathy in order to receive instructions from their hypothetical crews, who are assumed to be pos- sessors of esoteric knowledge.

There are also those who, influenced by the publicity, fame, or prestige of some institu tion, believe it the best to be found. The reality is that the candidate is not capable of choosing, and even less capable of effectively judging the goodness or defects of the instit ute he enters. If he was able to choose, it would be because his spiritual vi sion surpasses that of the instructors he is seeking, in which case there would be nothing they could teach him. Only the illumina- tion of his own spirit would guid e the candidate in this case. Far back in antiquity, the candidates for initiation into cer- tain esoteric brotherhoods were given two glasse s of wine or liquor, and were warned that one contained a deadly poison, leaving the neophyte to choose one and drink all its con- tents. If he did not accept this, he was immediately rejected. We know that sometimes it was only a trick to weigh the courage and decision of the indi vidual, but in other cases the contents were truly toxic. The premise was that if the indi- vidual drank the toxic drink, he would ha ve already failed, because he was not illuminated by his divine spark in the search he had embarked upon. It is very important that the seeker should analyze the motives guiding him, for in this way he will avoid much un- pleasantness and loss of time. We know that one of the most unpleasant aspects of human be havior is the fact that sapiens lies to himself with astounding frequency. His lies are so as- tute, subtle, and perfect, that he may waste many years of his life, only to discover that he was being cheated and he himself was the charlatan. The object of this self-deception"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"136 THE STELLAR MAN has been very precisely iden tified by psychology, and gener- ally refers to the individual's need for a high level of self- esteem. There are many techniques fo r self-deception and these are grouped under the general ca tegory of \"rationalization.\" Professor Gordon Allport gives this definition: \"Reason fits one's impulses and beliefs to the world of reality; rationalization fits one's concept of reality to one 's impulses and beliefs. Reasoning reveals the real caus es of our actions, and rationalization finds good reasons, to justify them.\" Here we have a treasure of psy- chological wisdom in a few words! Unfortunately no one makes use of this, in spite of the fact that it may give many people the key to the tragic events of their lives. The individual lies to himself in order to avoid facing his internal conflicts, and th ereby attains a momentary re- lief, but never a solution. This is why it is vital that anyone interested in Hermeticism or various esoter ic movements should examine his motives. Is there an authentic and true desire for spiritual superiority within him? Does he feel true spiritual thirst? Or is he only guided by the selfish de- sire to attain power, whic h will give him prestige, popularity, and recognition? It may be that the individua l is a potential convert for any collective movement, and who (as is frequently the case) seeks only to rid himself of hi s insignificant or undesirable \"I,\" by merging with some mass moveme nt.

Others may claim magic powers or secrets in orde r to obtain money or to at- tract the opposite sex, or they may simply wish to open their \"third eye\" without really having the least idea what it means. In any of these or si milar cases, it is easily inferred that the individual is not led by a genuine desire for spiritual superiority, and therefore it is preferable that he should re- frain from requesting Hermetic li ght, as he is not prepared for it, and is not real ly interested in it. This does not mean that a pe rson in any of the above cases does not possess, in dir ect proportion to the problem afflicting him, a real desire for spiritual advancement. Many times the most spiritual persons are those who encounter more than the usual amount of problems in their terrestrial life; they have more difficulty adapting their psychic vehi- cles, which are more subtle than usual, to the vicissitudes of our civilization. In many cases it occurs that a student enters a Hermetic brotherhood and ca nnot remain there because of the enormous difficulties that arise along the way. For this reason, the majority of the candi dates may be lost, as it is very simple to beco me part of a study group or contempla- tive school wher e there is no real initiation. If the student enters an initiatic school, he must face and overcome the phantom of himself if he desires to reach the light. Nature will test him without mercy in order to establish his true spiritual quality.

This situation may last forever or be overcome one day by an illuminating experi ence that opens the individ- ual's eyes forever. The lack of progress or success is generally due to the fact that the individual does not make sufficient effort, limiting the work he does . In order not to decei ve anyone, it must be stated that Hermeticism is no t in any way for those who are lazy or cherish their comfort. On the contrary, it is for those who are willing to make titanic efforts toward evolution. Here we have touched a point which we have already spo- ken of, but it is necessary to an alyze this point many times in order to understand it. We refer to the fact that the layman always thinks of occultism, ma gic, or Hermeticism as a sys- tem which will permit him, by the use of magic formulae, to obtain more rapidly an d without any signifi cant effort, that which would normally be atta ined only after much perse- verance, for example that we alth, love, work, or special favors will be gained through the intervention of higher powers.

In this case, all that entails avoi ding effort and obtaining things by miraculous procedures will be immediately accepted by"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"T HE S EEKERS 139 the populace. Without doubt, the tale of Aladdin and his Magic Lamp and A Thousand and One Arabian Nights were written by a loafer, unconscious ly projecting his occult dreams. This does no t mean that these marvels are not pos- sible, but they can in no wa y be an \"abracadabra\" for obtaining things with little work or effort. One of the Her- metic Principles states that \"every cause produces an effect,\" which would be potentially equivalent to the action that gave it origin, and will have a period of gestation or re- alization according to the impo rtance of what is sought. There is no miracle for obtaining things without effort, as if they could fall from heaven. This would be an arbitrary alienation of the cosmic order, and if this capricious act were possible, the matter in tegrating the Universe would break up. In the Cosmos ther e are neither miracles nor chance, only the Law of Cause and Effect, and the natural phe- nomena produced by the laws of Nature which are little known. What is called a mir acle is only a natural occur- rence, but of an unknown nature. There are also those who do no t find because they do not wish to find, for if they were to do so, they would be obliged to face the arduous problem of overcoming themselves in order to evolve. They know this beforeha nd, and it frightens them. On the other ha nd, to turn into an eternal seeker re- quires no great effort; just the opposite, it enables the individual to give fr ee rein to his mo st audacious dreams without any danger of misfort une.

Naturally this fantasy, ac- cording to the degree of sel f-deception, makes life easier and more bearable for the individua l, but one day he must face the cruel truth. Without wishing to offend anyone and only to make known what is true, it is necessary to consider that there are as many types of schools as there are types of individuals. There are schools for those who arrive into the light of Her- metic teaching for the firs t time in their chain of incarnations. There are schools for the greatly evolved, for people who are very intelligen t, stupid, simple, for those who have failed in their initiati on in their past lives, for mas- ters punished by the occult judges. There are schools of white magic and also of black magic. We have already mentioned th e danger of those who are psychologically sick taking re fuge in Hermeticism as a means of escaping their inte rnal problems, or using Her- meticism as an ince ntive for their most exalted dreams. Much more dangerous is the lamentable case of becoming a disciple of a sick master. Are there sick masters? Certainly there are, and this is explaine d by the ambiguity of the word \"Master\" and the fact that th e human brain has a ceiling of resistance, and beyond that lim it it may become unbalanced. Let us take the case of an individual who has gathered much esoteric knowledge, but who has not evolved spiritu- ally as a real Stellar Man due to insufficient internal cleanliness and not having been able to overcome his mental distur- bances arising from frustrati ons or diverse complexes (remember that mental distur bance is not a synonym for in-"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"T HE S EEKERS 141 sanity). This individual, at any given time, for reasons not necessary to analyze, may found a school and transmit teachings which naturally will be distorted by this master's psychological disturbances. Th is does not mean that the teachings transmitted by this man will be false; on the con- trary, they could be entirely true in theory. Here we must cite an aphorism of great esoteric significance which says, \"cor- rect methods in the hands of incorrect men function incorrectly; incorrect methods used by correct men function correctly.\" This refers to the fact that true knowledge in the hands of an individual who ha s morally, emotionally, or mentally gone astray will act deviously, and the one who re- ceives this teaching will experience a negative reaction as a result. On the other hand, it co uld happen that a man of in- tegrity and purity could be mistaken in some of the knowledge he possesses. In this case, we have not the least doubt that magically the final result will be adequate and correct. Naturally, the ideal would be an individual of in- tegrity with accurate knowledge. This explains why the black magicians may possess great esoteric knowledge, but their goal and true purposes ar e never known, as their object is always to deceive the student in their schools, to make use of him in a covert manner for their own ends. It is thus they always exploit the weaknesses of their followers, making them conceive all kinds of gr eat illusions fo r the future. Returning to the case we poi nted out regarding a sick master, this individual is gene rally completely sincere and is convinced that he is the so le possessor of the truth and knowledge. One of the most ou tstanding characteristics of these disturbed individuals is their self-worship, which is so"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"142 THE STE LLA R MAN overwhelming that they are co mpletely convinced they are GOD himself incarnated on Earth, and naturally are infalli- ble and omniscient. They are never mistaken, because they are always right. The loss of a sense of self-criticism and their self-glorification is easil y recognized by the language they use in referring to themselv es, as all their tales are al- ways directed toward show ing how they are powerful, wise, intelligent, and infallible. Any psychiatrist would find any of these men to be classi c case studies. We must realize that it is easy for a paranoid person and even a schizo- phrenic to have access to es oteric knowledge and adopt the role of Master. Nevertheless, it is relatively easy to recog- nize them: self-worship, insane infallibility, self-deification, self-glorification, and a supposed monopoly on the truth will generally be the most ou tstanding characteristics of these men. Summarizing, initiation may derail an individual from his purpose of spiritual perfec tion and lead him to a delir- ium of greatness and megalomania, within which he confuses the truth he has been exposed to with the dreams and illusions knit together in hi s unconscious state. That is, there is an \"initiatic abortion. \" For example, consider the case of an individual who was no t able to cleanse his soul, but who attained knowledge of certain things and was con- verted into the shadow of light.

Their real purpose is not to form Stellar Men, but to enlarge the battalions of certain ideological systems. One last warning with regard to the schools: always dis- trust those which praise the individual's self-esteem with repeated assurances that \"he is a very evolved person,\" \"very spiritual,\" or \"very intelligent and prepared.\" In some centers this system of flattery is used, either brazenly or subtly, as a method of using the student for pur- poses of which he is unawar e. Lies, skillfu lly dosed and directed, are used there as a weapon for handling the stu- dent, exploiting his base passions with a promise that he will unfailingly attain his desires. In the same way, we must dis- trust those who teach without asking anything in return, like a romantic Jesus Christ. If teachings are given gratis, it is be- cause they are of no value. That which is valuable to possess always requires something of equivalent value in return. Many pseudo-masters say that \"Teachings must be free.\" We state something absolutely different: true Teachings can- not be bought, as they are not fo r sale. But it is necessary that the student contribute somethin g of value to those who in- struct him—either to the schoo l, or to the physical Master. This is an occult law which cannot be violated. In conclusion, we insist that a school must always have a Master, because without one, being limited to just transmit- ting a legacy of the past, there can be no disciples, since in order to have students, there must be a Master. It does not matter if the instructor at the head of an esoteric brotherhood has not reached the stature of a \"great Master,\" because not everyone can reach this.

We live within the mind of God, who maintains the Cosmos in the same way someone sustains a thought by mental concentration. The Kybalion, a compendium of Hermetic Principles, gives us two aphorisms, which illustrate our knowledge. 1. The infinite mind of The All is the womb of the Universe. 2.

The Great Creator visualiz es creation and projects this toward the cosmic egg, giving origin to life in its infinite manifestations. In this way, the Hermeticist is not greatly concerned with studying the ch emical composition of the el- ements, but prefers to study the Principle of Mind, the essential composition of all that exists. Animals, minerals, vegetables, men, gods, planets, galaxies, universes, matter, and energy: all is mind, the Univer se is mental. For this reason, in the entire Cosmos there ar e the same laws, those of the mind. Mental energy is manifested on an infinite scale of vibra- tions, from the densest to th e most subtle. The combination of these vibrations, similar to the mixture of musical notes from a piano, produces the different elements or material of the Universe, with different characteristics between them, but with their intrinsic nature formed by mind. It is due to this that the an cient alchemists believed in the transmutation of lead or any ot her metal into gold, as the in- trinsic composition of all me tals is exactly the same: mind. In particular, our physical body is mind; our bones, blood, nervous system, in telligence, spirit, and our thoughts: all is mind. The All Mind (God) is infinite, eternal, immutable, and unknowable. The All Mind is neither energy nor matter, it is something superior to this; it is a livi ng and infinite mind, which can also be called Spirit, or real essence.

Since nothing exists beyond this, in reality all which is finite must really be nothing. The Kybalion places before us the following Hermetic question: What is the Universe? If nothing can exist beyond The All, then is the Universe all? No, this cannot be so, as the Universe seems to be made of multi- ple units and constantly changes. Then, if the Universe is not all, it must be nothing. We still have senses and feel the exis- tence of the Universe. And if the Universe is something and is not The AH, what can it be? Simply stated, it is a mental creation of The All. This is the origin of the well-known Hindu principle of \"Maya.\" The Hindus say that \"All is Maya.\" Translated, this means All is illusion. Certainly a thought of ours is illusion. If we have imaginatively create d the personage of a small, green-eyed old man with a walking stick made from a branch of a tree, this personag e is a fantasy and an illusion from our material point of view , but absolutely tangible, con- crete, and real for the matter, elements, or personages of our imaginative dream. A ghost is a ghost for the physical man, but a material being for anot her ghost. It will pass through wooden doors but not through \"doors for ghosts\" made of \"ghost wood.\" An automobile manufactur ed by thoughts (imaginary) cannot collide with a material ve hicle, but it can collide with another imaginary car, as it is on the same vibration, or within the same density of matter.

We should"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"150 THE STELLAR MAN reflect on the fact that for us, ma tter is only that energy with vibratory characteristics similar or identical to our own, and that energy will be the opposite pole.

Therefore, neither matter nor energy exist; there exists only one primordial energy, ma tter, or essence which com- prises everything. If we could escape from our classification in the Universe and join the All Mind, participating in its nature, the Uni- verse would instantly disintegra te (only for us) as we would have changed the observer' s situation or position. It is not difficult to understan d that if from the point of view of the absolute \"all is illusion,\" then from our mortal situation \"nothing is illusion\" be cause all that occurs affects what we can see and feel. Now, as sapiens, we have been made in the image of God and have within us the divine spark. If the corporal part of us is finite, relative, and muta- ble, the divine spark or spiritual essence is the absolute. Reflecting on this will lead us to a transcendental discovery: sapiens is the only being in the Universe who participates both in the nature of the thinker (God—divine spark), as well as in the structure of that imagined by the thinker (material world— physical body).

It should be asked if in this Universe imagined by sapiens, there are not also pl anets, galaxies, veg- etables, minerals, and even our selves on another dimensional scale. In reality, that which is infinitely great becomes con- fused with the infinitely small. We cannot say when something will become so small as to disappear or so large as to disintegrate.

This essential part is developed at the ex- pense of the oneiric (illusory) and thus sapiens can be converted into a mutant; an individual whose center of grav- ity shifts from the illusory to the absolute existing within himself (his own spirit, which is an emanation of God). This very profound change enables the indivi dual to gradually begin to understand the truth and finally reach the knowl- edge of absolute truth, which is immutable, immortal, and eternal, and which does not suff er change as time goes by because it is beyond time.

Generally, the more programmed a person is, the more di fficult it will be for him to elevate himself to the knowledge of the world of the absolute. THE PRINCIPLE OF CORRESPONDENCE The Principle of Correspondence states: \"As above, so below; as below, so above.\" This Hermetic Principle refers to the similarity between the various vibratory planes or classifications that exist within the arrangement of the Universe. The great scale of life runs from matter to spirit, existing in the midst of an in- finite vibratory scale. Within this range, the same laws acting on density, for example, also act on that which is spiritual or subtle. There is a corresponde nce or similarity among all cosmic phenomena, and the st udy of this analogy enables one to reach the unknown comme ncing from what is known. For example, astrology is base d on the suppos ition that man is a microcosm and he has inside himself an analogous replica of the Univer se, and that by means of this basic out- line, we are joined to the planets of our solar system and are influenced by them. The chart of the horo scope endeavors to reach the design of our internal vital structure by means of the Law of Correspondence. The planets manifest their influ- ence through the diff erent parts of our body with which they correspond. We know that Ar ies corresponds to the head and Pisces to the feet, and th ere is a sympathetic connection between the zodiacal sign, its ru ling planet, a nd the area of the body dominated by it.

The Cosmos in fluences man with its energy, but at the same time, is also influenced by man. Here is a principle of feedback, whose exact dimensions we cannot visualize. It is said that if a person throws a peb- ble into a lake, this simple ac t will some day influence the boundaries of the Univ erse in some way. Universal unity ex- ists in the sens e that all is united to all; we cannot separate ourselves from people or from our environment. You, the reader, are joined by an invisible thread to each inhabitant of our planet and to all beings that exist in the Cosmos. If you hate someone, you are destroyi ng yourself. If you wish to wreak revenge on some one, that force you set in motion will eventually fall upon you. Let us remember the Christian principles based on pure Hermeticism: \"Do unto others what you would have them do unto you\" or, \"Love one an- other.\" This Principle of Correspondence is ex plained by the fact that \"All is Mind; The Un iverse is Mental.\" Mind energy is the common nexus of all that exists. As there is external corresponde nce (with that which is ex- ternal), this also exists within our body, and also in relation to the opposite sex. Let us observe the likeness between the ton- sils and testicles or ovaries, between the spermatozoon and the medulla oblongata in the brain, or the relation be tween this lat- ter and the sex. In this case, th e loss of sexual sensitivity is often derived from increased intellectual sensitivity and vice versa. This is shown by an insatiable sexual appetite or lechery, which generally leads to a deteri oration of intelligence. With respect to the opposite sex, we can see that the penis corre- sponds to the clitoris and the uterus to the prostate."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"T HE S EVEN K EYS OF W ISDOM 155 Sympathetic magic is the art of establishing artificial cor- respondence betw een a person and a wax figure, talisman, plant, or any other object. In this way, the influence received by the wax doll will finally be directed toward the individ- ual who has served as the model. Based on the same principle, an individual can enter into corr espondence with a tree or a plant, and transfer his own illness to them, being thus equivalently healed. Acupuncture shows us a case of the advantageous use of corporeal equivalences, wher e through stimulation on the lobe of the ear, a headache may be cured. At first, it is very difficult to believe that ther e can be any relationship be- tween the lobe of the ear and the head, but concrete experience has proven that there is. It is possible by means of the needles used in acupuncture to cure many ailments or to lessen pain—all this by correspondence. The study of the Hermetic aphorism \"As above, so below; as below, so above\" is of extreme interest, as this explains the bonds of reciprocal influence which exist between an individ- ual and terrestrial and celestial Nature. The environment, radiating its forces upon us, brings about changes inside us and in the events which occur to us daily. On the other hand, our psychological condition an d our mental state are pro- jected toward Nature, and as a consequence of this, fortunate or tragic events may occur in our lives. This Hermetic apho- rism has great practical value, which will be revealed only to the zealous student. We will give some examples: 1. An individual keeps his room untidy and in complete disorder. This material fact of a p hysical nature immediately"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"156 THE STE LLA R MAN reflects upon the individual's ps yche, and he is intellectu- ally and emotionally converted into a replica of the physical conditions he maintains. His psyche will be the likeness of his room and vice versa. 2. The same individual from the above example spends a whole day scrupulously cleaning and tidying his room. As a consequence of this , he experiences a careful cleaning of his psyche and feels extraordinarily happy, \"light,\" and comfortable. 3. An individual who is bitter and negative habitually meets people who instinctively reject him, and without any rea son whatsoever they may end up hating him. 4. A woman believes she is ugl y and feels unattractive. Al though she is really \"fascina ting,\" her mental attitude repels the opposite sex. Further explanation of thes e cases is not necessary. Within the context of this important th eme of the Princi- ple of Correspondence, we wi ll take a close look at the relationship between legal acts to which the individual is subject and the concomitant dependence and lack of free- dom, which takes place on the pl ane of energy. To illustrate this, let us suppose that a wife is not in harmony with her husband and they separate, but are not divorced. Thus she is still firmly joined to her husband, and if he is a negative in- dividual who wishes evil to be fall her, this woman cannot become detached from these forces; she will continue to re- ceive them and they will surely continue to harm her even after ten years apar t from her mate. What is the reason for this? The cause resides in the aphorism \"As above, so below; as below, so above,\" because while there is a legal contract be-"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"T HE S EVEN K EYS OF W ISDOM 157 tween both spouses, they still are in reality indissolubly joined so long as the contract is legally binding. The laws of men project their influence into the world of energy which we shall call the \"astral plane, \" \"mental plane,\" or \"fourth dimension\" in order to desi gnate a place where the vibra- tions are much more subtle th an the material ones. What occurred in the previous exam ple also happens to ordinary people who are joined by a contract forming a legal entity, as in the case of a corporation. While the articles of incorpora- tion are in force, the partne rs will remain united and each one will have some effect on th e life of the rest, either posi- tively or negatively, and in turn will also receive from them a force which will dete rmine the important events in their lives. Thus there is danger in uniting our lives with those persons affected by heavy or ne gative Karma, which, in the case of a legal tie, will inevitably fall upon us. Through this Principle of Correspondence it is possible to understand how immensel y cruel it is to condemn a felon to life imprisonment. As a result of a law of sapiens, this indi- vidual will remain a prisoner indefinitely or permanently even after his death. Life imprisonment basically means prison after death. Those in this situation should not despair, and I wish to counsel them to pract ice a kind of mental defense to attain freedom upon death. This \"way out\" as we could call it, con- sists of repeating th e following prayer ev ery day: \"I free myself from the laws of man and deliver myself into the hands of divine justice.\" In orde r for this formula to be effec- tive and for the individual to truly become free, it is important that he s hould deeply feel wh at he is saying. If"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"158 THE STE LLA R MAN this is repeated mechanically, it will surely fail. It is different when a prisoner is condemned to capital punish ment, as in this case death frees him. We must also mention the en ormous importance of astro- nomical discoveries or observations for sapiens. If any individual should disc over a new star thro ugh his telescope and this star emits subtle ener gy of a destructive nature (all bodies emit energy which might be called \"m ass energy\"), these forces will reach our planet in a very intense form, as a mental channel has b een created for them. The temples of ancient Egypt were constructed so that during certain times of the year a person, looking toward the sky through a precisely situat ed opening, would see a spe- cific star known to the construc tors, with whic h the subject would try to establis h mental contact in order to receive a positive influence from it. It is also necessary to mention that this teaching of the seven Hermetic Keys is basic, so that the student will dis- cover himself what remains hi dden or what may be read between the lines. I wish to conclude this commentary on the Principle of Correspondence by honoring the memory of the ex traordi- nary Egyptians, who possessed great Hermetic knowledge before their decline. Both laymen and ignorant archeologists have always commented that in ancient Egypt people were so backward that they wors hipped animal gods, which was considered the height of mora l decadence. As far as we are concerned, this was the manife station of ancient Hermetic wisdom. To explain: the Egyptia ns had animal gods, not to be worshipped by them, but by the ordinary animals (those"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"T HE S EVEN K EYS OF W ISDOM 159 not set up as gods). The object of creating animal gods was to maintain the pu rity and elevation of the human race. These \"magical\" methods were used to prevent animals from penetrating into the human scale, from being incar- nated as sapiens. In the chapter \"The Illusion of True Knowledge,\" we dealt with the incarnation of consciousness which relates to this subject. Upon receiving th e irradiation of man's consciousness, animals partly assimila te the energy of the divine spark or magical fire, which then enables them to enter into the huma n scale for the first time after they die as animals. This occurs prim arily with domestic animals or those which for any special reas on are constan tly in contact with man, such as a circus dog, for example, as he is exposed closely to human vibrations. I must pause for a moment to imagine the ironic smiles of those who believe that certainly the writer of this book suf- fers from some mental disord er. I think I understand them perfectly well, because if I had not had the opportunity of verifying the absolute truth of Hermetic science to my satis- faction, or if I was a neophy te in these matters and was reading this book, I would thi nk as they do. On the other hand, if unbelieving readers could change places with me for a few minutes by means of a magical transmigration, they would completely agree with me. It is necessary to live the Hermetic experience to c onfirm what has been learned intellectually. I also feel obliged to state that in Hermeticism one does not believe or disbelieve; one simply understands or does not understand. We continue with the explan ation of the animal gods. When an animal inca rnates as a human being for the first"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"160 THE STE LLA R MAN time, it will be like an individu al on a very inferior level, with very strong animal instin cts, and will certainly cause great harm to society. It will either become a delinquent or an immoral pervert as it lacks adequate restra ints on its in- stincts. This animal-individual must very gradually rise in level throughout many reincarnations. It must be under- stood that if many animal s are converted into the sapiens species, humanity will face a serious crisis, and this is pre- cisely what is occurring now. By means of ritual magic, th e Egyptian priests sacrificed and mummified a dog, for example, and buried it in a secret place. This dog received a name and was anointed as \"god of the dogs\" at the moment of its death. Thus, this animal was converted into the occu lt guardian, which prevented dogs from entering into the huma n scale, and it had been specially prepared for this. We reserve the complete and pro- found explanation of this ma gical operation, which would only serve to sa tisfy the curiosity of the unversed. We must add that man can ne ver reincarnate as an ani- mal, and that not everyone re incarnates, but this is a separate subject. THE PRINCIPLE OF VIBRATION The Principle of Vibration states: \"Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates.\" This law indicates that ever ything in the Universe vi- brates and that nothing remain s stationary. Matter, energy, and spirit are only the result of different vibratory states. The spirit represents the extreme pole of the fastest vibra- tions whose frequenc y is so high that it appears to be"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"T HE S EVEN K EYS OF W ISDOM 161 absolutely still. The other pole is form ed by extremely dense matter. Hermeticism states that between both poles there are millions and millions of differe nt intensities and modes of vibration. We know that the molecules comprising matter are in constant vibration, and that in turn, the atoms forming them are also in constant motion and vibration. In their turn, the electrons and protons ar e also vibrating rapidly. Without any fear of error, we can affirm that there is nothing in the Universe that is not \"mental matter vibrating at different frequencies.\" Li ght, heat, magnetism, and elec- tricity are only different vibratory modes. That mysterious plane known as the \"fourth di mension\" is only a vibratory state of high frequency. If a person could make his physical body vibrate at a very high fre quency—let us call this fre- quency X—he would physically penetrate into the world of the fourth dimension. Nevertheless, it is not any such remote possibility that interests us, bu t only the cont rol of our own vibrations. Our thought s, emotions, desires, or impulses are only vibratory states. Our physic al body is an assembly of systems, which vibrate at the same frequency, and health is only the harmonious vibration of the body. Illn ess is dishar- mony, and death is the rupture of the vibrator y cohesion of the biological systems. In our personal life, everything re- volves around vibrat ion; if we are happy it is due to a positive vibration, sadness is due to a negative vibration. Our thoughts will make us more or less intelligent according to our mental vibration. E ach person has a mental wave- length of his own, according to the vibratory frequency of his intelligence; the shorter th e mental wave, the more intel- ligent the indivi dual and vice versa."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"162 THE STE LLA R MAN The difficulty some peopl e have in communicating comes from their different ment al wavelengths. When their vibratory frequencies do not coincide, mutual understand- ing is impeded. If we wish to communicate with an individual and have him real ly understand us, we must make an effort to adapt our mental wave to his vibratory state in order to establish perf ect affinity. This explains the surprising differences between two persons who normally understand each other well; one of them will have notably varied his mental wavelength, either by lengthening or shortening it, leaving the othe r person \"out of frequency,\" just as if he tried to tune in to a certain radio station on a wrong frequency. There are different reasons for vibratory drops in people. Health problems, depressive stat es, inertia, internal conflicts, and intellectual apathy are some of the principal causes. In the case of those individuals who permanently have a very long wavelength (of low frequenc y), this is caused by the in- dividual's lack of intellectual preparation. The environment is also a very powerful influence on people's vibrations, as we live within an ocean of vibrations that constantly have an im pact upon us, awakening similar forces within us. The cosmic and terrestrial space which sur- rounds us is saturated with vibrations, and they have an important influence on people. One can sense in the inhabi- tants of a city, for example, ei ther a positive or negative vibratory atmosphere, and the same thing can occur with a visit to a family home where we will immediately feel a warm and positive at mosphere or a for ce which repels us. What takes place in our homes is th at the vibratory radiation"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"T HE S EVEN K EYS OF W ISDOM 163 of those who live there penetrates the physical structure, im- pregnating it with positive or negative energy easily sensed by the visitors. Thus, there are homes, which awaken in visi- tors an intolerable sadness, or in some cases, visitors feel a profound depression or even suicidal tendencies. We receive the psychic states of those who live or work in these places. The behavioral ha bits, the emotional states, the habitual thoughts, and the mora l and spiritual standards of the individual dete rmine the goodness or unsuitability of his vibratory state, which in turn decisively influences his daily life. Family and human groups in general are made up of whirlpools of energy which are felt by those coming into contact with them. Vibrations accumulate within the indi- vidual, that is, he collects good or evil vibra tions, and there are times when he is a verita ble time bomb due to the latent forces within him. These forces are either destructive or cre- ative, and under the influence of an adequate detonator, will violently explode, producing eith er favorable or negative events. This force has the characteristic of greatly affecting any- one who comes into contact with a person whose vibrations are intense, the result being th at one can be contaminated by what the \"sender\" feels. This is especially true when a \"sender\" shares his troubles with another and then feels great relief while th e listener becomes depressed. Perhaps the most vulnerable persons are those in professions such as psychiatry, who are damaged or tainted by contact with their patients' mental scars. Those places where base passi ons are let loose, such as"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"164 THE STELLAR MAN bars or brothels, are the center of base and negative vibra- tions, which noticea bly harm those w ho frequent them. Any man who wishes to be su ccessful in his personal ob- jectives or who wishes to increase his capacity to accomplish things, either spiritually or ma terially must, through self-dis- cipline, raise his vibrations in order not to be affected by what is called \"bad luck\" or misfortune. It is necessary to practice strict ment al hygiene in order not to be affected by elements in th e atmosphere surround- ing us. There are strong negative forces actuall y capable of killing a person because their tone or basic note is destruc- tive and capable of causing di sintegration. We know there are sounds (vibrations) which can destroy the cohesion of matter (infrasonic) or which can produce medicinal healing (ultrasonic). The power of th e laser is well known (vibra- tion), its light can pier ce the hardest material. Sapiens unconsciously seeks a remedy for his vibratory disharmony and reso rts to good music, which reestablishes his internal equilibrium. Neve rtheless, there are musical rhythms so inharmonious that they create negative states within people. The sound of certain inst ruments have ca- dences that under certain conditions cause deep sadness, as is the case of the \"quena,\" a type of indigenous flute. We also know the pernicious effect of sounds which ex ceed certain decibel levels and which provoke consider able nervous fa- tigue causing loss of both manual and intellectual efficiency. The vibration of the spoken word also has a powerful ef- fect on listeners, either benefici al or harmful. There are those with great personal charm, but whose voices, although not disagreeable, are repellent. This depends on th e result of the"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"T HE S EVEN K EYS OF W ISDOM 165 impact of sonic oscillations. If this impact is harmonious with ours, we will feel affect ion and liking, and vice versa. People are not aware that they are received either well or badly according to their vibrations. It is easy to verify the influe nce of an individual's oscilla- tory energy. There is a very simple experiment, which consists of having two groups of indoor plants which must be put in separate places. One group of plants should be spoken to every day as if they were human beings and given thoughts of love, friendship, an d fortitude. The other group should be abandoned to chance. As the days go by, it will be seen that the plants spoken to and given positive attention become very beauti ful and grow faster , although they have the same earth, light, an d water as the others. Another very simple experime nt is to test the inductive power of our vibrations on peop le. For this, it is necessary to contact someone who does not li ke us. After overcoming the feeling of repulsion this pers on provokes in us, we must make an effort to feel deep sympathy and cordiality for him. After a short time we will see a radical change in him and he will come to feel very friendl y toward us. Many times it is we ourselves who cause rejec tion due to our hostility toward others. Through the Principle of Vibration, it is possible to un- derstand that curses real ly exist but have nothing supernatural about them; they are only th e condensation and projection of powerfully destructive vibrations. The same phenomenon exists with blessings, but acts inversely. When a couple who are lovers speak words of love, the pleasure experienced is not only due to the knowledge that"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"166 THE STELLAR MAN they are loved, but also to the vibratory influence of the words. If we reflect on this, it is possi ble to conceive of the exis- tence of magical words, which are only the combination of letters that produce oscillatory phenomena . The traditional karate shout (kiai), for example, was orig inally conceived in order to effectively paralyze the adversary. It had to be emit- ted in a certain tone and freque ncy, because if it was not, it would have no effect. The attentive student who meditates on the Principle of Vibration will be able to unders tand things of great impor- tance; the one without eyes to see or ears to hear will remain on the threshold of the mystery. THE PRINCIPLE OF POLARITY The Principle of Polarity states: \"Everything is dual; everything has two poles; everything has its pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same; opposites are identical in nature but different in de- gree; extremes meet; all truths are but half-truths; all paradoxes may be reconciled.\" This principle involves the te aching that unity as such does not exist in the Universe because everything is dual; everything has two faces or opposite poles. The most pro- found secrets of life are hidden behind this simple fact, as it is polarity which ma intains the rhythm of life. If there were no opposite poles, life would not be possibl e. The basic point to be understood in the study of polarit y is the fact that op- posites are always present in the same element; this law can never be applied to different elements. Temperature has two extremes, cold and heat, but one cannot speak of the positive"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"T HE S EVEN K EYS OF W ISDOM 167 pole of temperature in relation to the negative pole of elec- tricity. The Principle of Pola rity works along a vibratory scale of degrees in which a strength is manifested, a grada- tion which goes from the positive to the negative. Thus, light and dar kness represent two extremes of the same thing; in one case there is the presence of light and in the other, the lack of it. Love and hate are opposite poles of the same thing, that is, the hu man feeling of attraction and repulsion. Spirit and matter are the same thing, but are man- ifested in opposite vibrations. Th e same is true with life and death and good and evil. It is necessary to note that in these te rms there is no ab- solute, as no on e can state what is abso lute cold or heat, for example. We simply speak of more or less of a quantity of something at a given moment . Thus, undoubtedly, we could say that \"love is less hate than no love.\" And \"fear is less bravery than pure bravery.\" Th e two poles can always be classified as positive and nega tive, and their difference is just a question of degree. Th is is why Hermeticism upholds the feasibility of mental transm utation, that is, of transform- ing something into its opposite. Hate may be transmuted into love, poverty into riches, cowardice into bravery, and ig- norance into wisdom, by means of sliding along the scale of polarity. There is always an extreme positive and an extreme negative, the positive pole being of a higher nature than the negative. Courage is positive with respect to fear; light with respect to darkness; love with respect to hate. The Hermeticist, acting as a true scientist of the mind, can raise his internal vibrations at will and transmute nega- tive into positive."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"168 THE STE LLA R MAN According to The Kybalion, \"the undesirable is slain by changing its polarity.\" Illness can be converted to health by changing its polarit y through the power of the mind, which polarizes at the extreme opposite of what it is trying to over- come. Logically, it is only possi ble to transmute opposites of the same thing, as it would no t be possible, in any way, to transmute a pear into a peach. On the ot her hand, it is possi- ble to transform a green pear into a ripe pear. In occultism there is a well -known symbol found in an- cient esoteric books—the snake biting its own tail . Specifically, this re presents polarity, in which the two ex- tremes are perpetually attract ed and seek to devour each other, although this never occurs. Vacuum attracts plenitude, innocence and experience are mu tually absorbed. Under this principle the existence of an accessible truth to sapiens in his habitual condition of life is de nied, and we maintain that all truth is semi-truth, and it is on ly possible to reach absolute truth by raising oneself above the Principle of Polarity, be- yond opposites, to reach the worl d of causes. Naive people believe that the time will come when good will triumph over evil in the world in a definite manner. According to this prin- ciple, the victory of either good or evil is impossible. Good and evil represent the two extr emes of something and are therefore absolu tely relative. If a fox enters a chicken coop and devours a chicken, it is very bad for the hen, but very good for the fox that is only fo llowing the natural principle of staying alive. In reality, evil works for go od and good for evil. Life works for death, for from the moment one is born, one starts to die. De ath works for life, as all destruction is a transformation, which create s a new form of life. What"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"T HE S EVEN K EYS OF W ISDOM 169 would happen to the light if there was no darkness? Does not light owe its existence to the fact that darkness exists? Solely from the evid ence that something exists, we must im- mediately know that the oppo site is also a reality. Due to polarity ma n and woman are attr acted and try to fuse. This is the law of the eternal serpent who constantly bites its own tail . It is very interesting to analyze the aphorism that \"extremes meet.\" If we apply this to love, for example, we can verify that it is easier to transform hate into love than to convert indifference into l ove. As opposites meet, the dis- tance is shorter from one extr eme to another than from the middle of the scal e to an extreme pole. Hermetically "},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"170 THE STE LLA R MAN speaking, we may say that the shortest distance from one point to another is not a st raight line, but a circle. This circle represents the gradual scale which runs be- tween two poles, the positive represented by number one hundred and the negative by ze ro. These figures are entirely arbitrary and for demonstration purposes only. We maintain that it is easier to cross th e bridge from zer o to one hundred than to go from fifty to one hundred. The drawing shows this, as the distance is much shorter than if we lay out the circumference of the circle as a straight line. In our example, number fifty is the symbol of eternal indecision and apathy, representing those who are lu kewarm who have no place in the kingdom of God. This expl ains the phenomenon of con- version, when one individua l changes his ideology for a diametrically opposite one. This secret may act as consola- tion to those with serious pr oblems; they are closer to success than they may think, on ly mediocrity has no remedy. Hermeticism maintains that indecision is more fatal than error; the reason for this is cl ear. Those who are able to read between the lines and digest this knowledge will derive great wisdom. The ancient alchemists held that it is possible to trans- mute lead into gold. In some cases this referred to a material act, and in others it was sym bolic. Gold is only one end of the scale of metals; therefore, the alchemist changed the vi- bration and the polarization of the lead until it was transformed into gold. When th is refers to the transforma- tion of the internal metals into spiritual gold, the example is equally valid. Following the Principle of Mental Transmutation em-"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"T HE S EVEN K EYS OF W ISDOM 171 ployed by advanced Hermeticis ts, we will make a brief sketch of the mech anism that must be employed, although this will be useless in the hand s of those who have not first reached internal unificatio n under the command of a \"Supe- rior I.\" This subject will be covered in subsequent pages. We have already explained that there are many planes of vibration. As regards the Princi ple of Mental Transmutation, for the sake of simplicity we will speak of two basic planes: the superior world of causes, a nd the lower world of effects, as shown in diagram 5. The lower world of effects is the physical plane; the supe- rior world of causes is the plan e of the emanation of life. The Hermeticist, in order to acco mplish a process of transmuta- tion, rises to the world of his \"Superior I\" and polarizes himself through his mind in the pole oppos ite to the vibra- tion he wishes to destroy. Re call that \"the undesirable is slain by changing its polarity.\" This is equivalent to rising above the effects or phenomena which the individual may"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"172 THE STE LLA R MAN be suffering at a certain time. By this process, a vibration is changed degree by de gree until one reaches what is desired. Even though this might seem easy in theory, in order to achieve this in practice, a rigi d discipline and the prior cre- ation of a \"Superior I\" is required; otherwise, this will never be more than just theory. Recall the aphorism from The Kybalion which says, \"Mind (as well as metals and elemen ts) may be transmuted from state to state, degr ee to degree, condition to condition, pole to pole, vibration to vibration.\" In order to put mental or al- chemical transmutation into prac tice, it is first necessary to learn to change the polarity of our own mind, as otherwise we will not be able to influence our environment. All processes of transmutation, whether it is an attempt to change our internal world or th e material world, is always a mental operation, as All is Mind. It is very interesting for the student to be able not only to change his own mental state, but also that of other people who are suffering from negative or destructive vibr ations of any kind. From the point of view of th e analysis of daily problems, polarity is a very useful key, as it enables people to appreci- ate the true value of their c onflicts or obstacles, without magnifying or underestimating them. The Hermeticist will know, for example, that if he finds himself temporarily in a distressing situation, it is possible to cha nge this gradually, polarizing toward th e opposite, until the ot her extreme is ef- fectively reached. The time required for this operation will depend on the importance of what is desired, as everything has its gestation time in Natu re. Something of little impor-"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"T HE S EVEN K EYS OF W ISDOM 173 tance will be accomplished very quickly; a much larger proj- ect will take a longer time to bear fruit. Let us keep before us the gr eat Hermetic lesson that \"the undesirable is slain by changing its polarity.\" Meditating on this will enable the student to reach great knowledge. THE PRINCIPLE OF RHYTHM The Principle of Rhythm states: \"Everything flows out and in; everything has its tides; all things rise and fall; the pendulum- swing manifests in everything; th e measure of the swing to the right, is the measure of the swing to the left; rhythm compensates.\" This principle teaches us th at everything is subject to rhythmic oscillation, which is manifested between two poles. There is action and reacti on, an ebb and flow, an ad- vance and retreat, a rise and fall , and this is applicable to absolutely everything. The Un iverse, the planets, Nature, man, nations, and civilizations , all are born to reach the heights and then to decline and be destroyed, thus fulfilling the cycle of life. This ebb and fl ow is manifested in our phys- ical body, in our emotions, feel ings, instincts, intelligence, and even in the different vital si tuations in which we live. It refers to our personal projects , our relationships with other people, our contact wi th Nature, and in general, everything that forms a part of our lives. The symbol of the Principle of Rhythm is the pendulum. Its oscillation explains the ac tion of rhythm, whose measure- ment toward the left is the same as that toward the right. On a practical note, we could even call this law, \"t he Law of the Pendulum.\" Creation occurs according to the pendulum; there is an emanation of The All, and an absorption follows."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"174 THE STELLAR MAN Emanation is the time of crea tion and absorption is the stage in which The All reintegrates its energy in itself. We can compare this to the cycle of human respiration. The Supreme Being radiates his energy until it materializes into a physical creation, and wh en this reaches the summit, its maximum degree of materializ ation, it then starts the op- posite oscillation of the pendul um until it again reaches dematerialization or death, and the divine creative energy is reintegrated into its original so urce. In the same way, nations reach the summit of th eir power and then gradually decline. Nothing escapes this law; it is an absolutely inevitable process. It is not easy, howev er, to determine when a human being, a civilization, or a st rength has reached its zenith. What we do know with certain ty is that decay inevitably takes place. The Principle of Rhythm together with that of Polarity, previously mentioned, are th e forces which maintain the process of life, as life is al ways a force which moves alterna- tively and rhythmically between two poles. If we had to define life and death, we would say that life is the oscillation between two poles, and death the polarization of the force at one extreme for a time which surpasses the equilibrium of Nature. This polarization can be negative or positive. It is negative when both po les are too close t ogether, each one of them losing a great part of its intrinsic qualities. It is positive when it is possible to consciously destroy an undesirable vi- bration and the polarity is changed, polarizing in the extreme opposite direction. In the case of negative polar ization due to a weakening of the opposite poles, a decay of vital forces is produced"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"T HE S EVEN K EYS OF W ISDOM 175 which may end in the fusion of the poles; this is equivalent to death. The secret of life is thus revealed in a simple man- ner: it is the constant mainte nance of the tension between two poles. Truthfully, we could say that when a child is born, the opposite poles of his life are very far apart and therefore the tension between th em is great. But as the child grows older, the opposites begin to join, and life declines. In this case, the two poles are the conscious and the subcon- scious, or we may also speak of the individual himself and his environment. The constant impact betwee n man and en- vironment (stimulus) slowly de polarizes him, draining his vital force. By examining man's vital func tions, we can verify that polarity and rhythm control the organism in its most delicate processes, and that illness is always a dist urbance of the rhythm or polarity. The body n eeds to maintain a constant state of equilibrium, and the loss of this implies an abnormal condition. Science calls this equilibrium homeostasis. Home- ostasis has not been sufficiently studied, and it is certain that if scientists would use the Prin ciples of Rhythm and Polarity, they would discove r many new things. The functions of the heart, breathing, sleeping, and alert- ness are all governed by the la w of the pendulum. Sleep, for example, provides us with the necessary alternation in order to maintain our equilibrium. We know that the lack of sleep provokes serious disorders, as it destroys organic equilibrium.

Nevertheless, only three rhythms have been revealed. • The 24-day masculine rhythm, with 12 positive days and 12 negative days • The 28-day feminine rhythm, with 14 positive days and 14 negative days • The 33-day intellectual rhythm, with 16½ positive days and 16½ negative days The rhythms of 40-day, 56-da y, 92-day, and 276-day cy- cles have not yet been revealed to the masses. The object of this book is not to supply instructions on biorhythms which would require a separate volume.

These people should keep a di ary in which they note all happy or unfortunate occurren ces, in order to determine which of the rhythms has a greater influence in their lives, as this is something that is entirely personal. Some individuals will be very affected by the negative in the 24-day rhythm, while others will feel the negative cycle of the 33-day rhythm. One of the most important as pects of the Principle of Rhythm is the fact that each pe rson creates his own rhythmic state according to th e nature of his ac ts, which take on a rhythm of their own when repeated several times. By virtue of these events being repeated pe riodically in an individual's life, these events or acts occu r without his will.

We will briefly illustrate how a negative rhyt hm is born: a person becomes the victim of a theft for example, and as it is not a very large th eft, he does not bother to file a follow- up complaint with the authoritie s. As a conseq uence of this, a negative rhythm is formed an d this individual periodically suffers losses of an economic nature, which doubtlessly will occur during planetar y positions similar to those that existed on the day the first theft took pl ace. Another easily verifiable example concerns marital fight s, which end by creating a rhythm of disharmony that will provoke the ar ising of new and more serious problems. It is thus that rhythms of wealth or poverty are created, happiness or misfortune, harmony or disharmony, and once th ey are in motion, it is very difficult to neutralize them. It is well known that misfortunes come in \"waves\" as the flowing of the ti de; that is, they occur rapidly without the individual having time to react. On the other hand, there are also streaks of \"good luck\" during which a person experiences a series of positive occurrences. From this it is deduced th at the individual take s on a rhythm at a certain moment for reasons not always easy to establish, and as long as that rhythm does not change, the positive or neg- ative tone will be maintain ed. Unfortunately, there are individuals who take on a rhythm of different calamities from an early ag e which are then repeat ed at each oscillation of the pendulum.

Habits are formed by a rhyt hm and when they are perni- cious, they can only be dest royed by the cr eation of a new rhythmic state of an opposite nature. The Law of the Pe ndulum completes the knowledge of mental transmutation, as it teach es us that it is possible to rise above rhythmic oscillation by becoming po larized in the pole where one desires to remain, thus avoiding being car- ried by the ebb and flow. Sapiens is a slave to the oscillatory movement of the pendulum, and if he is successful in any- thing, it is because his actions happen to coincide with the movement of the pendulum pure ly by chance. People are absolutely subjected to the Law of the Pendulum, whether it be regarding their finances, health, work, vitality, or love, and are like leaves in a storm, blown here and there without having any idea of where the tide of life is taking them. On the other hand, the Hermeticis t can surmount this Principle of Rhythm, even though he cannot annul it. W ith his will power he can rise to the superi or plane of causes and let the rhythmic oscillation flow beneath him. What is called the \"Law of Compensation\" has much in common with the Principle of Rhythm. Compensation means equilibrium or balancing, which occurs when \"the measure of the swing to the le ft determines the measure of the swing to the right.\" This determines the amount of things a person can possess, as the individual has, in quan- tity, the exact proportion of what he is lacking. It is thus that"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"T HE S EVEN K EYS OF W ISDOM 179 a man who is rich lacks other advantages given to the poor. We all know the saying , \"lucky in cards, unlucky in love\" or vice versa. This aphorism indicat es something a bout the idea we are discussing. As we have already covered this point, it is therefore interesting to stat e that absolutely all human be- ings are born with the same quantity or margin of things they may have; the only vari ation is their distribution. Thus, let us say that we a ll have one hundred vital units (that which we can in time possess) and one hundred nega- tive units (that whic h we lack). A rich man is one who has nullified the greater part of hi s possibilities in order to con- centrate his one hundred vital units on making money. Love, spiritual sensitivity, family ha ppiness, or other things will certainly be among the things la cking, or negative units. Ex- pressed in a different way, a man may never have more than the symbolic one hundred, but th is quantity can be distrib- uted among many things or co ncentrated on only two or three. An even distribution results in a more balanced life, but a life that will probably not be outstanding in any special way. Concentration implies th e sacrifice of many things. Example 1: Distribution of Vital Units Riches: 45 units Power: 20 units Moral Nobility: 5 units Love:  5 units Intelligence: 10 units Health: 10 units Happiness: 5 units Result: An individual who is rich and powerful, but very unhappy."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"180 THE STELLAR MAN Example 2: Distribution of Vital Units Riches: 10 units Power: 10 units Love: 15  units Friendship: 10 units Moral Nobility: 15 units Intelligence: 15 units Health: 10 units Happiness: 15 units Result: A more balanced individual, with a richer life, filled with different elements. These examples are absolutely arbitrary, and their only point is to illustrate what occurs with th e distribution or con- centration of vital units. The reader who is aware of this theory can set up examples for different cases. For example, we could map out the distribution of our muscular capacity which we could entirely use up just by walking. Or, we could walk, chop wood, swim, climb, and box, distributing our vital energy into various areas. Simi- larly, we can use a fixed elec trical potential to supply one source of great power consumption, or divide it among hun- dreds of ordinary bulbs. According to the law of vital units, it is very interesting to analyze what occurs when two people wed, thus sharing their vital units.

THE PRINCIPLE OF CAUSE AND EFFECT The Principle of Cause and Effect states: \"Every Cause has its Effect; every Effect has its Cause; everything happens according to the Law; Chance is only a name for a Law not recognized; there are many planes of causation, but nothing escapes the Law.\" This law teaches us that nothi ng in the Universe happens by chance; everything has a spec ific cause. What we call chance is only something wh ere its causes remain unknown. It is not possible th at something should exist apart from and beyond the laws, as this force would be indepe ndent and su- perior to the Universe. Applying the Law of Rhythm to the Law of Cause and Effect, we co uld state that the magnitude of an effect is always equivalent to the importance of the cause which generated it. As we explained when discussing the Principle of Pola rity, there are two ba sic planes: that of causes (superior) and that of effects (lower), and man in his daily life is aware only of the latter. We live in the world of effects, and only the Hermeticis t has knowledge of the occult causes of events. The most well-known manifesta tion of chance is what Hindus call Karma, a word which we will use because it is the most adequate. Karma ende avors to explain the relation- ship existing between events currently happ ening to an individual and his actions in the pa st, either in this life or in a previous one. Contra ry to what is believed, Karma is not always negative; there is also a positive side of Karma, which is equivalent to our good deeds in the past.

Reincarnation is a very pers onal matter in which the in- dividual \"feels\" within him that it exists, and if he does not feel it, then no argum ent will convince him. Furthermore, if it were possible to produce proof, it woul d detract from the freedom of choice, as it would pressure the individual; if an individual was convinced of th e truth of some occult phe- nomenon, he might en ter an esoteric sc hool without genuine spiritual concern. Nevertheless , in previous pages, we sug- gested a method of intellectually conceiving what reincarnation is: \"a power whic h takes possession of matter.\" With the experiment on indoor plants, we might realize that what we really did was to \"i ncarnate\" a force in the veg- etable matter which survives the life of the plant and continues evolution indefinitely. This is an analogy of what happens when \"spiritual\" ener gy incarnates in an animal body, for when the an imal dies, the spirit continues incarnat- ing in new bodies until completing an evolutionary cycle in matter. The Law of Cause and Effect gives us a rational explana- tion of the apparent injustic es in the world; we can understand why a child is born cri ppled or dies at an early age; it is possible to realize why some pe ople with exquisite spiritual sensitivity live in poverty and other true beasts swim in riches.

New light is thus shed on histor ical events; we can understand how certain relevant historical figures reached great power arising from nothing, as in the ca se of Hitler. Certainly we do not know what cause placed hi m in the position of power he occupied, for life is like an enormous tapestry upon which history is woven stitc h by stitch, and on wh ich all events are interwoven. This is the veil of Maya, which cannot be pene- trated by common mortals. The action of Karma is one of the reasons why we main- tain that \"all is written,\" as the present is always determined by our past acts. Each person has a certain quantity of causes, which are held in chec k for a period of time during his life, which forge the individual's destiny as they materi- alize into effects. Only the truly wise man can partially neutralize the effects of undesirable causes. We have already spoken of the Lords of Destiny or Ar- chons who govern the destiny of sapiens. In reality, they work with the Karma of indivi duals, but from a collective point of view. It is the Karma of humanity that they control and manage, and within this ge neral context they act as oc- cult judges who rewa rd or penalize the act ions of the human being. The Principle of Cause and Eff ect acts parallel to this, that is, the human being \"puni shes himself\" with his own Karma; the Archons plan and \"s tage\" the action so the indi- vidual receives beneficial lessons and can undergo important experiences.

He who had mu rdered a fellow man will in turn die due to the direct or indirect in fluence of his past action. The one who took advantage of love or passion to enslave a woman will in this life be under the domination of the fe- male sex. Occasionally a be ggar will disp lay terrible arrogance and seem to despise th e entire world, and this at- titude is not just simple psyc hological compensation, but has deeper roots. Certainly this i ndividual occupi ed a high posi- tion in his past life, and as a result, his excessive pride survived the death of his physical body. It can be debated that if we had lived previously in other bodies, we would surely remember this, but this reasoning is infantile; when the brain is de stroyed, memory is erased. Nevertheless, instinctive impulses derived from past experi- ences survive. For example, if an individual had been condemned for theft in his previous incarnation, he would in his present life be extremely honest, but compulsively so. In the case of gambling we ca n see a direct action of the Archons of Destiny, who choo se which individuals will win the greatest prizes and who w ill then have their lives en- tirely changed. In the case of those who are already millionaires who win a substantial prize, this will only increase or reinforce the events previously decreed by th e Lords of Destiny.

There is another asp ect of great interest in what we are covering, and this refers to the individual who commits a concealed theft, enjoying ill-go tten gains or pr operty he has not earned. This man enters in to a contract with Nature; someday he must return or pay for what he stole. Therefore, if we are imprudent enough to help this person, we will to a great extent be responsible for the development of his life, and Nature will demand that we pay the pending debt. All that we need or desire belongs to the common pool of Nature, which gives nothing, but sells us what we require, and it must always be paid for. Nothing is gratis; we even have to pay for our lives, for the moments of pleasure, for love, for serenity, fo r knowledge, for powe r, and even for the air we breathe. We do not noti ce this, as we consider money as the only viable instrument of payment. We are not aware that in cosmic commerce mone y has no value, and other things are required, such as the \"golden broth\" which we mentioned in previous chapters . To the \"devil, \" for example, one soul is more va luable than all the gold in the world. The most important thing a bout the Law of Cause and Effect is that the advanced He rmeticist can raise himself to the higher world of causes by a prodigious effort of will. By polarizing himself on this plane, he converts himself into a cause, and thus stops living th e effects which emanate from the higher plane.

THE PRINCIPLE OF GENDER The Principle of Gender states: \"Gender is in everything; every- thing has its Masculine and Fe minine Principles; Gender manifests on all planes.\" The seventh Hermetic Principle completes the knowl- edge of the laws of Nature , showing us that gender is manifested in everything and that the masculine and femi- nine forces are present in ever ything. We must not make the mistake of confusing gender with sex, as sex refers only to the structure of the genital organs and the difference in adaptation between male and fe male. Sex is one of the many manifestations of the Principl e of Gender and corresponds to the physical plane, but as we are aware, there are many planes where the Mind Principle exists, as does gender. Her- meticism maintains that gender has an im pelling nature, and that this nature acts even in the atom, in which we find both the positive and the negative, whose mutual influence cre- ates energy. Instead of refe rring to positive and negative poles, we can speak more ap propriately of the masculine and feminine, the generator and the conceiver. The positive element of electricity is masc uline, and the negative element is feminine. The feminine or negative is the womb of all electrical and magnetic phenomena. The femini ne energy seeks union with the masculine, and absorbs from it that which is active, thus producing a new force.

As stated in previous pages, analyzing our physical body, we will discover that it possesses bipolarity. Thus, man is masculine from the solar plexus down and feminine from this zone up to and includin g the head, while with woman, the opposite is true. In this manner we can observe that woman is cerebrally masculine, and man cerebrally feminine. The principle of conception in man is in his imagination, and in woman is in her uterus. Within our bodies, the right side is masculine or positive and the left side, negative; the right cerebral hemisphere is positive and the left, negative. It is possible, by means of the Prin ciple of Gender, to understand the hidden significance of the my stic or religious act of join- ing the palms of the hands in prayer, which involves a process of generation upon oppo sing positive and negative. It is through the occult law that the student of Hermeti- cism can create a new being, a mutant who will be conceived with superior qualitie s of an acutely huma n being. There is no other real path for spiritual evolution; all th at does not in- volve using this secret is pure fantasy, and from it only purely subjective results will be attained. From understanding this Law of Gender we can also re- alize how deceptive it is to evade problems, difficulties, and obstacles, considering them me rely as hurdles, a waste of time, or irritating situations. The Hermeticist must visualize problems as the negative pole of life, that is, the force against which he must oppose his pos itive generative energy in order to create what he desires. If we understand this phe- nomenon we will achieve a co mpletely new and different"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"T HE S EVEN K EYS OF W ISDOM 189 vision of the hurdles in our life, which will be nothing more than the complement needed to develop our consciousness. Consciousness, the precise qualit y we wish to attain, is the result of the collision between inertia and our will power, di- rected by an awakened intelligence. If this struggle between opposing forces did not exist, Hermetic progress would not be possible, and neit her would evolution. At this point we w ill reveal the great magic secret of mu- tation of sapiens, or man of clay, into a Stellar Man. This transformation is only possible if the subject enters into con- tact with a flesh and blood Mast er who will be his spiritual Father. And who will the mother be? The mo ther is the beast in the individual, that is, the side of himself that is of a femi- nine or negative polarity, spiritu ally speaking. It is thus that the initiate is a child of the beast and the sp iritual Master. The student who is facing a real process of initiation (not sym- bolic) will find himself strongl y dragged by the pendulum in an oscillation which will sudden ly bring him closer to the Master, or to the beast. There will be moments when he will sense the overwhelming evid ence of Hermeticism deep within himself, feeling himsel f raised to high planes of awareness. At other times, all will be darkness; the initiation will lose all sense a nd purpose, and the st udent will believe himself submitted to a cruel j oke. Only the gradual stopping of this pendular movement will enable him to reach the sta- bility of conscious knowledge. The Principle of Gender shows us that it is not possible for a creation to exist with out the presence of the father and mother elements, and this is va lid throughout the entire Uni- verse, including the process of initiation. This is the reason"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"190 THE STE LLA R MAN why a solitary man, no matter how much theo retical knowl- edge he may possess, can onl y reach subjective results because he lacks the other generative pole. This is why it is necessary to find a Master, and the sig- nificance of this fact was stated previously. If a Master is not a mutant, he is then a false mast er, but this term is relative. Although he may be false in rela tion to that which is supe- rior and optimum, he can also be very true in relation to that which is inferior. Therefor e, it is necessary to clarify that although a Master is not a mutant, he can be of great help for a student. What he will not be able to offer, in this case, will be knowledge of the absolute, nor could he trans- mit the sacred flame, which according to fa bles was stolen from heaven by Prometheus. This sacred flame is not an ab- straction or a symbol. It is a fact, and is the spiritual power symbolized in the acronym IN RI which appears over the head of Jesus Christ. Its true Hermetic meaning is: Inge Natura Renovatur Integral, but can also be read as Jesus Nascente Renovatur Iao, or Igni Nitrus Roris Invenitur. All these formulas were used by the early Rosicrucians (un- known today) and they refe rred precisely to the divine fire, the magic ferment of alchemists , which as we have already stated, \"renews everything.\" Nevertheless, one must not assu me that it is sufficient to find a Master in order to evolve . On the contrary , the disciple will progress only to th e extent that he himself handles the Principle of Gender in a superior manner, because even though a positive or active spiritual ferment is necessary, it is also nonetheless indispensable that the student himself cre- ate a mental and etheric be ing with the character and"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"T HE S EVEN K EYS OF W ISDOM 191 qualities of the initiate. This is known as Theurgy, a secret teaching we will study further on. Continuing with the Principle of Gender, it is necessary to consider the tremendous po sitive or negative influence that marriage can have in a person's life. The influence is in- jurious when the union is so inharmonious th at it becomes dangerously destructive, and fa vorable when there is true love and harmony. The Hermetic concept of marriage is quite different from the common one. It is not neces sary for there to be a mar- riage contract to give this uni on its name. We will explain this proceeding from the oppos ite angle: there may be a cou- ple (and this, unfortu nately, is frequent ) who have entered into a legal and lawful marriage, but who absolu tely lack the aptitude for achieving what we could call a matrimonial aura, and therefore they can be marri ed for tw enty years without forming this aura. The matrimonial aura is a hidden offspring, a mental child of both mates; it is a closed positive magnetic field which joins, harmonizes, and protects the couple, mak- ing the marriage truly \"established\" or really formed, according to the laws of Nature . It is not the laws of man which wed two people; it is only Nature which joins or sep- arates them, according to prevailing c onditions. The matrimonial aura is the true secret of conjugal happiness and union. When this doe s not exist, there is nothing, no matter how many certificate s have been issued by competent au- thorities.

Religions which consider marriage something indestruc- tible and irreversible , binding the partie s for life under the penalty of serious si n, urgently need to modify that com- mandment, for this approach means proceeding inversely, as the sapiens beast generally does. This approach means trying to maintain the artificial union of the family by an unnatural imposition instead of a clear and beautiful manifestation of love. Is it not preferable to teach people to truly love? In truth, if a family is not joined by genuine love, it is only a group of beasts who live toge ther under obligation or for convenience, a si tuation that relates to more people than we would like. It is superfluous to say th at happiness is only possible in homes where there is a real marriage, for other- wise there is only a poor imitati on of an ideal situation, as there is only one ti e which will keep ma n and wife united in a true way—love. The lack of it is the only thing that con- spires against the stability of the family. We wish to conclude this br ief study of gender, suggest- ing that the reader try to disc over for himself all that lies between the lines and meditate d eeply on this su bject, as the most profound secrets are reveal ed with this key.

In an initiatic school the disciple has an opportunity to reach true evolution, to free himself from the collective soul of sapiens and convert himself into an authentic mutant or Stellar Man. A person who has been able to enter an initiatic school will need a seri es of indicators or points of reference to become oriented in the wo rk accomplished there. Other- wise, he will become prematur ely disillusioned when he cannot understand the sense or contents of the disciplines and instructions.

For the moment, we will limit ourse lves to describing the condi- tions which a disciple must possess, and the internal and external obstacles he must ov ercome.

A good guide for selection would be more or less the following: 1. To possess spiritual go ld (internal content) 2. To be free from prejudices or be capable of overcoming them 3. To have consciousness of one's own insignificance 4. To ardently yearn for initiation (the complete process) as the most important thing in life 5. To practice loyalty, dedicatio n, constancy, and faithfulness toward the School 6. To possess a flexible and agile intelligence 7. To harmonize oneself with the fundamental keynote of the School 8.

What is basically s ought is the individual 's inner nature, and his capacity to dedicate himsel f to a Hermetic task which lasts not only for all this terrest rial life, but will furthermore determine his future existence. No true School wishes to waste its time with individuals who \"cheat,\" that is, who de- lude themselves in their yearni ng for spiritua l excellence and their firm determination to b ecome converted into superior beings. The Schools prefer to dedicate their efforts to those who effectively maintain a cons tant line of action in their work toward initiation. It is nece ssary to clarify that it is only possible to become a disciple af ter a period of trial in the School. An individual, however , may remain forever as a simple student without ever becoming a disciple, because he does not have the required aptit ude for it. There is an \"easy path\" and a \"difficult path\" wh ich are the paths of the stu- dent and of the disciple. Each has disadvantages and privileges, and therefore no one, without an exhaustive analysis of the matter, can stat e that \"he will never be satis- fied\" until he becomes a disciple. To explain these differen ces, we will compare both options: THE EASY PATH OF THE STUDENT Obligations: Very few.

In the novel Zanoni, one of these tests is described: the meeting with the specter on the threshol d. Nevertheless, in real life this experience is less spectacular than the description in Ed- ward Bulwer Lytton's novel, but more difficult due to its subtlety.

He is beyond good and evil, beyond opposites, beyond pleasure and pain; beyond happiness and misfortu ne; beyond life and death. These are not symbolic achievements, but are absolutely real and true. However, at this poi nt the neophyte is impelled to ask a series of questions. Th e neophyte will wonder if there is an attempt to convert the in itiate into a \"Superman,\" an invincible and indestructible being who cannot become ill or die, and who does not need to eat or carry out normal bio- logical functions.

For our part, we accept Cagliostro and the Count of Saint Germain as two of the greates t Hermetic Masters who have ever existed, and deny, at the same time, the alleged death of Cagliostro in prison. Even if this had occurred, it would not in any way make this great ma n any less brilliant.

Continuing with the false concept of \"Superman,\" we wish to ask the reader to imag ine how he would feel if he was Clark Kent, Superman of American comics, the man who arrived from the planet Krypton. At first this may seem very desirable, but after reflect ing a while, it is easy to un- derstand what a terrible punishment it would be, to be physically immortal and indest ructible, illness-proof, dan- ger-proof, immune to any attack, able to resist desires of the heart or sex, to be constant ly and inflexibly virtuous and perfect. If such a being existed, he would truly be a creation of the devil, a mechanical robo t, a being absolutely inhuman and unhappy, and deserving of great pity. We must remem- ber that we learn from our failures and not from our successes, and that we appreciat e things only when we are in danger of losing them. The spice of li fe is the lack of knowledge about what the future holds for us, constantly facing the danger of losing all we have or of failing to reach our desires. Havi ng everything and ne ver losing anything would be unbearable and inhuman. The great Hermetic Masters are not free from danger, ill- ness, or death, and this is pr ecisely what is most beautiful, sublime, and human about thei r existence—the fact that being so powerful in their fight for others, they are so reluc- tant to use their spiritual stre ngth for their own benefit.

The great Kabbalist Eliphas Le vi said that \"those men (the great initiates) found it preferable to govern kings than to be kings themselv es.\" Is it possible to understand this? It is not difficult to understand that a truly important man should prefer to pass thr ough life unnoticed, occupying a second-rate or third-rate position, fleeing from the fame, riches, and honors which mo rtalize human genius. The candidate for initiation must choose the easy or diffi- cult path, but it should be done impartially and consciously, considering that if he chooses th e path of the student, in the future he may become a discip le. If he endeavors to turn himself prematurely into a disciple, his failure may be so crushing and painful that he will become irreversibly trau- matized, and in this case must await another opportunity in a future incarnation. Whatever the choice, the stud ent is faced with internal barriers that he must be aware of in order to have a clear idea of what is happening to him at a given moment. These barriers, among others, are: vanity, pride, egotism, and self- sufficiency. When the individual has a very high degree of self-im- portance, this becomes the main barrier against facing Hermetic truth without prejudice; he believes he knows everything and \"is above these tricks.\" Of course, he uses this or some similar rationaliz ation out of ignorance of the subject, as without doubt he ha s never before been to a Her- metic School of Initiation, and without having lived through this experience, he can have no opinion.

Torn apart by this feeling, and in order to save their precious pride, they dis- credit the Teachings and the Sc hool, alleging for some reason (which they always find) that th e School is deficient, useless, or dangerous. Returning to the four main obstacles which face the can- didate for initiation, it is necessa ry to state that vanity is not only the narcissism of the indi vidual, but also refers to his hollow knowledge—that knowledge which has neither con- tent nor any truly essential, profound, or transcendental significance. Vanity and pride require th at a person should constantly appear before othe rs as having power, impor- tance, or intelligence, whic h without doubt he does not possess. Pride is an infantile e ndeavor to fight against one's own weakness, assuming a stre ngth one lacks. Egotism leads the individual to believe that he is the center of the Universe, and that all revolves around hi m. On the other hand, self- sufficiency is only ignorance of what one does not know. In summary, these defects make man exaggerate his own importance and believe himself to be superior to common mortals, looking down on all th ose who don't have his same educational level, social sta nding, or economic status. Only the experience of day- to-day living will eventually convince him that he is not as privileged as he had thought. The real harm that this situation creat es regarding an individual's possibility of Hermetic evoluti on consists in his unconscious rejection of all he hears, ex cept when it come s from people with an image, prestige, or fame superior to his own."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"202 THE STELLAR MAN In reality there is no possi bility that the candidate will authentically face Hermeticism with his inte lligence until he lives the esoteric experience which Gurdjieff described as \"the experience of his own nothingness/' which is basically becoming aware of his own impotence to escape from the general conditions which guide one's life. This means realiz- ing that it is not possible to a ttain what one desires, because things turn out differently than we expect, or simply do not occur, and moreover, undesirable events also happen. It would be more to the point to state that what Gurdjieff called \"our own nothingness\" is, in truth, the practical real- ization that one is absolu tely programmed physically, instinctively, emotionally, and intellectually; that it is impos- sible to disrupt the program, as this cannot be destroyed or modified in its fundamental and profound structures. Thus, the more important and inflated image a man has of himself, the less likely it is that he will be able to understand Her- metic philosophy. The program rejects Hermeticism, as it is not incorporated in cultural community values, and if it were, people would blindly accept it. But such acceptance would have no value, as people would not go beyond imita- tion and superstition. In other words, it is important to genuinely and intrinsically recognize one's own smallness and insignificance in or der to take the first steps to initiation, otherwise, it would not be the individual himself who would be a student or disciple, but the \"false being,\" the \"mask,\" or the \"person,\" that is to say, the personality.

For the Hermeticist, \"personality\" has a \"diabolic\" sense, as it is the me chanism which keeps the \"essential I\" dormant and a prisoner. At the beginning of his initia tion, the student must en- deavor to transcend his cereb ral programming, even for a few minutes, for it will permit him to \"see himself\" to a cer- tain extent. In order to transcend his program, he must force himself to be as impersonal as possible, leaving all previous concepts or ideas aside, as if he was a living intelligence fly- ing through the Universe, but wi thout a physical body. To be impersonal involves impartiality, peace, freedom from fear, and a lack of faith and \"anti- faith.\" There is nothing more dangerous than those neophytes who are possessed with a \"holy faith\" or those who ar e dominated by blind \"anti- faith.\" Neither can ever appr oach Hermeticism in a truly intelligent way. It is necessary to insist that the neophyte must clearly un- derstand that if he approaches a school, it is not to be taught, since this is not the function of initiatic schools; Hermeticism is a science prohibited to Homo sapiens. He is admitted to the School only to give him an oppor tunity to demonstrate the value of his internal content, that is, the power of his latent spiritual force. If this force does not exist, or is too scant, the individual is closer to the animal. This would make the leap he is trying to ta ke completely impossi ble, due to the im- mensity of the abyss between th e opposite poles: animal and man. The degree of spiritual force required indicates the magnitude of the distance an individual is from the animal condition.

The knowledge is in the School, but is not made available in the same manner as a science, a discipline, or any technique is taught; it is the disciple who must grasp this basic knowledge, which is always veiled. Thus it is nec- essary to \"have eyes to see a nd ears to hear.\" This grasping of knowledge will only be poss ible if the st udent, with a supreme effort of consciousness, is able to penetrate the veil of allegories, parables, comparisons, and similes. Only those who are guided by their spirit or \"essential I\" will learn the truth. Those who are motivated solely by curiosity, egotism, or purely passional interests ca nnot reach the light of truth. This is fortunate, as there coul d be no greater curse than a Stellar Man or Stellar Woman who is villainous, immoral, or irresponsible; it is certain this cannot co me to pass. When sapiens shows his internal value, he is worthy of being helped and prepared fo r his subsequent and planned mutation. Gradually, Hermetic science will cease being a prohibited knowledge for him, as he will be found worthy of the high honor of knowing the Universal science. Summarizing, Hermetic know ledge is only for a small elite, but anyone who is deeply moved by an authentic spir- itual restlessness, may form part of this elite. Furthermore, the populace does not desire this knowledge; on the con- trary, they despise it, confirming Jesus' words, \"do not throw pearls before swine.\" There are many who were born swine, are happy in that state, and will die swine.

Although the neophyte does not arrive at an initiatic school \"to be taught\" as we have already stated, he must at- tend lectures or instructional classe s. How is one to understand this paradox? It is ve ry simple: instruction is not for teaching, but rather to destroy the disciple's cerebral pro- gram to a certain extent, so he will gather his own knowledge through a process of interior illu mination. The lectures are not to be memorize d or \"learned,\" but they are the spiritual and in tellectual ferment fo r the profound trans- formations which must be produced within the student. Nevertheless, for these changes to be effective, it is neces- sary to know how to listen so that everyt hing received during instruction reac hes one's reasoning faculty in an inte- gral form, as sapiens usually understands only what he wishes to, and rejects whatever conflicts with his self- esteem, inferior passions, or personal interests."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"XII T RUE I NITIATION rue and authentic initiation is always a profound, con- crete, objective, and material process.

Initiation truly represents a tremendously signifi- cant act from the point of view of universal truth, as it is the transformation of animal sapiens into Stellar Man. Such an im- mense achievement, surpassi ng the highest dreams of sapiens, cannot be faced in the festive or frivolous spirit of an interesting adventure. This achievement should be evalu- ated in all its enormous dimensions as the most noble and sublime undertaking human courag e can aspire to; it is the conscious abandonment of the Homo sapiens species to join an immensely superior species: Stellar Man. In the history of mankind there has never been, nor will there ever be, a feat comparable in importance to th e epic of the spiritual eleva- tion of Homo sapiens. However, many pe ople talk of becoming an \"initia te,\" the same way one becomes a physi- cian, engineer, electronic technician, member of the Rotary Club, or a follower of the study of yoga or para psychology.

Ignorant people have the satisfaction of their animal ap- petites as their only goal, an d their productive efforts are intended mainly to gather the gold which will enable them to obtain pleasure and material benefits. Their center of gravity is located in the corporeal mass. It is the body which uses the brain, inspires emo tions, and arouses passion. The body is the master, and the individual himself is the slave. When the corporeal matter decays and dies, the individual suddenly finds himself freed from his slavery. At that mo- ment, he understands for the first time, a nd without any benefit, that he never had life, thoughts, feelings, or experi- ences of his own, and that he was only a serv ant who had to toil to feed and satisfy the n eeds of a mass of protoplasm. That life, which should have been used to evolve, to be happy, and to progress, was instead convert ed into the mere memory of those things he did or could not do. In truth, the body is not th e individual; the individual takes a physical body in order to acquire expe rience, which permits him to perfect himself and evolve. This purpose is generally frustrated or is terr ibly insufficient and petty. In the final inventory of his life, the individual will realize how little he gained for himself during his existence, and how much he was obliged to give, just so the sapiens circus could continue operating.

This spiritualized and human- ized animal no longe r experiences passional states, as it is subject to the individual's hi gher consciousness. Neverthe- less, it is necessary to unders tand that th e body itself has nothing evil or dirty about it; on the contrary , it is a perfect biological structure reflecting the master hand of the Great Creator. It is the individual himself who perverts the body and leads it to corruption. It is thus that the animals we see in a savage state are completely pure in their animal nature, and have no knowledge of perver sity. If they kill, it is be- cause of fright or the need fo r food, but not fo r the love of killing. Sapiens is the only bloodthirs ty and impure animal, as he is neither animal nor human, but a hybrid. We could summarize the purpose of initiation in a short sentence: \"initiation is the conversi on of a programmed animal into an unprogrammed and free Stel lar Man.\" There is only one way to accomplish this: the dest ruction of the personality, since this is the individual' s program. Hermetically speak- ing, we may consider that sapiens is composed of two basic forces: his cerebral biological program (personality) and his spirit or divine spark, which could be called the \"Superior I.\" The program contains all the individual's robot-like ele- ments, which connect him to the central com puter of the species. The spirit is the eman ation of God, or the primor- dial cause of life; it incarna tes in a physical body to acquire experience in matter.

It is here that it loses its com- pulsive and dreamlike power and where it experiences a deep \"pruning\" and tr ansformation. All this is possible only if certain requirements are complied with, which refer basi- cally to the disciple's dedica tion and perseverance, together with a deep understa nding and close union with the School and the instructor. In order to understand this, it is necessary to have an idea of the constituti on of the human be ing—of his spirit, body, and soul. The soul has alwa ys been an abstraction and a mystery, and all attempts to define or explain it have been distinguished by thei r vagueness and lack of content. Her- metic tradition tells us that the soul of sapiens is composed of four major systems: the procreat ive, digestive, circulatory, and respiratory systems, and th at each one of these is in charge of an elemental intelligence which corresponds to one of the four elements. Procreative system: Fire Digestive system: Earth Circulatory system: Water Respiratory system: Air The great Hermes Trismegistus , Master of Masters, would be horrified to see the mysterie s of the sphinx unveiled.

It must be understood that the \"intelligences\" we refer to are \"elemental beings\" with their own intelligence and consciousn ess according to their native element. A fire being takes charge of our procreative system; an earth being takes charge of our digestive system; a water being takes charge of our ci rculatory system; and an air being takes charge of our respirator y system. The initiate can put himself in mental contact with these intelligences in order to reinforce, support, or modify his work. To avoid the reader from forming fantastic ideas regard- ing the intelligences of our four systems, we must clarify that they should no t be imagined as human figures, but as the abstract concept of \"intellige nt emanations of the soul of each element.\" Just as God unfolds in man through the ema- nation of his divine spark, Nature, in its feminine side, projects itself by incorporating the elemental spark of its four \"kingdoms\" in man. Thus man is made up of a visible and an invisible si de. The visible side corresponds to the feminine side of God; the soul , and the invisible, to the mas- culine side of God, that is the spirit. The Universe is similar to the example we have given, as everything that we can see, the form, structure an d body of the Cosmos , is the feminine side of the Great Creator (the Universal Mother).

When the infant grows, he himself will corrupt his elem ental intelligences by trying, through imitation and contagion, to practice the same vices and bad habits he s ees around him. Freud, by claiming that the libido is the origin of all the individual's problems, cov- ered only the fire aspect of th e soul (very cleverly, we might add, since fire is the origin of life), but he left the other three vital sources untouched. When a child smokes for the first time, he will find the taste of the cigarette very unpleasant and the smoke produces coughi ng, dizziness, and headaches. This is due to the fact that the intelligence of the respiratory apparatus reacts against this \"a ggression\" and thus shows its rejection. Nevertheless, its missi on is to serve the individual, and if, through an effort of hi s will, he continues smoking, there will come a time when th e air intelligence yields and accepts the tobacco. This is its own ruination. Just like a per- son, it becomes corrupted and is converted into a nicotine addict. Hysteria, self-pity, depressive states, and emotional problems in general, are located in the circulatory system. Ra- pacity, egotism, violence, hate, envy, and jealousy reside in the digestive system, and complexes in general reside in the procreative system. The individual's behavior soils and cor- rupts his four intelligences, degrading his own soul and distancing him from the possibilities of spiritual evolution.

The words \"I am the way\" which must be under- stood literally, refer precisely to the \"Superior I.\" To describe initiation thr ough a parable, we would say that it is an endeavor to \"decrucify Christ.\" For this, there is only one path, because if one meditates on the situation of the individual, one wi ll reach the conclusion that there is lit- tle the individual can do, as he is programmed according to the interests of the central computer. He cannot struggle against what is inside him and which forms part of his in- stincts, emotions, and thoughts.

It should be noted that the sixth system or the \"Volitive I\" is completely unknown to sapiens who absolutely lacks it. On the other hand, all people have number seven, but this \"Superior I\" neither manifests it- self nor intervenes in the individual's life in any way; it lives in \"limbo\" and is only connected to the corporeal structure by a thin thread. It is very important to co nsider the fact that the \"Volitive I\" is created exclusively by man when he is converted into a true initiate, as all the other sy stems are the work of God, the Great Creator. Illustrated below are the different ways the human being may be manifested.

The individual must make in- tense efforts and special sacrifices, beyond the usual level, which will have as their goal th e formation of a volitive force and his own spiritual supremacy. The reason or purpose be- hind this discipline is importa nt. If a person acted because he was impelled by ambition or obligation, this would in no way lead to the formation of his \"Volitive I,\" as he would have acted under strong comp ulsion, a force beyond himself (necessity or passion). In addi tion, the student must be per- fectly clear as to what he is doing and why he is doing it, so that the being in formation w ill have a high degree of aware- ness and intelligence. For this, it is most useful to look into a mirror specially dedicated to this purpose, looking directly at the space between the eyebrows, and after a short while quietly repeat several times: \"I am will power.\" The success of this exercise depends exclus ively on the individual's emo- tional state during its execution, as well as the manner in which he pronounces and emotionally vibrates when saying the words: \"I am.\" While emphatically sa ying these words, the student should internally feel \"somet hing\" in the form of a strange emotion as he enc ounters or contemplates a sub- lime interior presence. If these conditions are not manifested or if the exercise is done mech anically, there will be no effect whatsoever.

What is really occur- ring is that the \"Volitive I\" is converted into the supreme king of the microcosm, having above him only the \"Superior I.\" When it is observed that the \"Volitive I\" has acquired cer- tain power, the studen t can take the next step, which consists of trying to awaken himself, freeing himself from the univer- sal oneiric force. In this, as in everything that refers to Hermeticism, it is necessary to reac h profound understand- ing in order to be absolutely certain and cl ear as to the reason or purpose for doing certain things. We recommend the study of a good scientific book on hypnosis in order to understand the similarity between hyp- notic and somnambular sleep, which is the normal state of sapiens. The works of professor Anatol Milechnin are ex- tremely useful for getting a glimpse of the mystery of sleep as it relates to what is being pres ented in this book. There are five basic points that the disciple must keep be- fore him in order to \"break\" the phenomenon of hypnotic sleep. These do not consist of an awakening technique, but are rather adopted methods of behavior that will promote awakening. These poin ts are as follows: 1. To stop lying 2. To stop dreaming 3. To learn how to think 4. To live in the present moment 5. To activate the physical body"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"T RUE I NITIATION 219 Point 1: TO STOP LYING Points 1 and 2 are closely relate d, as we will now see. Start- ing with the problem of lying, it is necessary for the student to realize that he constantly lies without realiz ing it. When a person has lied for a long time, the time comes when he can no longer distinguish between what is false and what is true. People convince themselves of their own lies, becoming vic- tims of their own inventions as they begin to direct their lives by standards of behavior, ideas, feelings, or instincts which do not correspond to their inner rea lity. What is truly serious in this matter is that th e individual lose s all points of reference regarding what comprises truth, and what com- prises lies. He becomes used to considering as true only that which is convenient for his pe rsonal interests; everything that is in opposition to his sel f-esteem or in conflict with al- ready established prejudi ces, he considers false. A person lies in order to avoid difficult problems, to evade responsibility, or to avoid damage to his self-esteem. So the individual constantly li es to himself and to others, and becomes entangled in an il lusory world born out of his personal fantasy. He forms concepts, ideas, judgments, aver- sions, and attachments that have no relation to actual events, but are only the reflection of a life full of lies and listening to lies, since everyone lies. One of the most powerful reason s for lying is to create a good image of oneself, and to pr event others fr om seeing us as we really are beneath th e mask of appearances. Each mask is a lie, and there are thousands in e ach individual's collection of disguises. It is n ecessary to be conscious of this phenomenon of lying, and to re alize its magnitude and fre-"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"220 THE STELLAR MAN quency, as well as the enormous damage it causes. One should have the goal of neither lying to oneself nor to others, and in the case of a \"white lie,\" to be aware of telling it, and judging the need for such a li e with one's own conscience. Point 2: TO STOP DREAMING People are always infused with all kinds of fantastic ideas about themselves, the world, people, love, idealism, society, etc. Led by his eagerness to evade a disagreeable reality, man gives free rein to his imaginatio n and is inclined to believe the first agreeable lie he encoun ters along the way. The indi- vidual projects his personal illusions onto a cold and immutable reality, and thus de ceiving himself, he endeavors to contemplate reality through rose-colored glasses. \"Disillu- sion\" is a painful process an d can be prolonge d, depending on how much time the individual takes to realize he is living artificially and that this conditi on is a product of his internal dreams. Great courage is require d to face reality and to de- stroy the mirage of a pleasant dream. On the other hand, we must consider that sooner or later dreams fade. What is dan- gerous for the human being is that these dreams are substituted by others, which in due course also fade. This is the life history of the human being: a succession of oneiric dreams. It is a vicious circle which is extremely difficult to break. Awakening from a broken dream, and the frustration this causes, incites a person to fabricate new and more- agreeable dreams in order to combat disillusion, loneliness, and disappointment. The lack of communication between human beings arises from the f act that all their dreams are"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"T RUE I NITIATION 221 different, and therefore, psychologically speaking, they live in different worlds. If a person decides to seriously investig ate the reason for his various acts and reactions, he will r ealize how his behav- ior is directed toward mainta ining his personal fantasies. Great courage, discipline, and determination are necessary to face the truth, without an y kind of adornment. Such courage is lacking in the imme nse majority of human beings. It is pathetic to see how peop le cling to their petty illusions, generally a result of their onei ric fantasies, while disdaining all that is truly valuable. Societ y is organized in this manner; its scale of values is so distur bed that it considers everything that enables the individual to enjoy passing pleasures as most desirable, and then c ondemns its member s to suffer \"eternally\" for the price of a fleeting pleasure. The Hermeticist proceeds to the contrary: he submits himself voluntarily to suffering, self-disciplin e, and priva- tion in order to attain eter nal peace and happiness. Each individual should consciously j udge what could be most de- sirable, and on the other hand, determine if the one who seeks passing pleasure is really ha ppy, or if he is in truth pro- foundly unhappy in his eterna l vacuum. The majority of people have a ph ilosophy that tells them \"after this life there is no other; let us take advantage of this and enjoy ourselves as much as possib le.\" Those who have converted this thought into their personal cred o should ask themselves if they are truly satisfied and if the innumerable playthings so- ciety offers them are sufficient to quench their eternal thirst and alleviate the anguish of their loneliness. The world of today is perfectly organized, but for what?"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"222 THE STELLAR MAN By observing and meditating, we will discover that every- thing is perfectly synchronized to maintain and feed the \"dream,\" and the \"dreams\" of sapiens. An individual will cease dreaming only when he has understood and lived what we are explaining: when he proves to his amazement that each person lives drugged by hi s personal dreams, which are transformed into the rudder which directs his life. It is useful to analyze all the projects one has had in life, everything that one has desire d and planned to accomplish, but which in retros pect appear as a phantasmal unreality. Point 3: TO LEARN HOW TO THINK It is important to completely re educate the thin king process in order to make it really crea tive, because on ly when this function is accomplished can th e individual think clearly. Creative thinking is not the act of \"inventing\" something, but rather consists of thi nking in an unprogrammed way. One's intelligence shou ld be used to face each event as if it were really new, cas ting prejudices to th e side. This will en- able the individual to create a result or form a judgment that is truly impartial, as he has given up his habitual sources and does not consider anythi ng as a known fact. Described symbolically, creativ e thought consists of dispensing with the program in orde r to form a high level of judgment, which is not affected in its ge nesis by the compulsive force of the information stored in th e cerebral computer. When peo- ple think, they do so compulsively and in spite of themselves. This is as evident as the fact that thought is not voluntary, for an individual can not cease thinking when he so desires. On the contrary, it is impossible for him to oust"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"T RUE I NITIATION 223 ideas from his imagination or prevent unpleasant ideas from arising. The organization and security of the modern world has created conditions of life in which the individual has no need to make a great effort in order to survive. He can subsist with little effort, and in some cases practically none at all, especially when compared to the harsh struggle for life in Nature's wilderness. There is nothing which really obliges an individual to use his basic intelligence; on the contrary, he has been converted into an expert in evading or dodging all truly trying points presented to him which question his intelligence. It is much safer and more comfort- able to not venture along the path of free thought, but to instead accept or adopt alr eady established and approved systems of thought and behavi or. Imitation and blind ac- ceptance have become the easiest road to satisfy sapiens' ever-diminishing intellectual cu riosity. Hermetically, on this subject, we speak of \"dead\" and \"living\" knowledge. \"Dead\" knowledge is that whic h is known by its specific meaning, but whose in terrelation with th e whole is ignored. It is a single part of knowle dge and it is not known how, when, or where it fits in relati on to the remaining pieces of the overall plan. In contrast, \"living\" knowledg e is obtained in a state of superior awareness, and is always the product of perfect \"mental digestion.\" \"Dead\" knowledge is born sole ly from the intellect, while \"living\" knowledge orig inates in the mind. Because \"living\" knowledge is essentially understood by th e awakened thinker, he is ther efore conscious of th e position which this knowledge occupies in the gene ral context of the Universe. Here we approach one of the most important points"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"224 THE STELLAR MAN which separate sapiens and Stellar Man. Sapiens thinks only with his brain and his intellige nce is therefore limited to the intellectual-cerebral source. Furt her, the average person uses only a small portion of his brai n for his intellectual function- ing, which is furthe rmore located in a so rt of \"pre-brain\" composed of the four intelligences and the unconscious, which is the ancestral soul of the animal of the species. For this reason, even on hi gh intellectual planes, sapiens obeys the mandate of his animal soul, the beast. In the Bible refer- ence is made to the number 666 as the number of the beast. Upon inverting this figure we find the nu mber of man: 999. The Hermeticist, however, through his initiatic work, reaches the formation of the \"s piritual system,\" the mind, which is lacking in the average person, who usually refers to it therefore, as a symbolic abstraction of the psyche. In real- ity, the mind is the superior integration of the human faculties into a whole, directed by the \"Volitive I,\" and manifesting the \"Superior I,\" which is the spirit or the individual himself. Sapiens, making use of his rudime ntary \"pre-brain,\" (the union of one part of his brain with the four in telligences and the unconscious) is able to make scientific discoveries thanks to the transmission of culture from gene ration to generation and by taking advantage of an assembly of collective experi- ences and knowledge. Thus, a l ong list of ge niuses have contributed with thei r discoveries and investigations to rais- ing the level of our civilization.

They have totally overlooked any relation to the whole, having no knowledge"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"T RUE I NITIATION 225 of the effect or reaction their work would subsequently have on everything. We must necessarily classify these intellectual geniuses as \"semi-sages\" as they are monoconceptual, visualizing everything through the prism of their specialty. It is interest- ing to meditate on what woul d be the behavi or, reactions, appreciation, and scale of valu es possessed by individuals of great intelligence who do not belong to huma n terrestrial culture. It would be interes ting to also know the thought process of superior beings who are high above pettiness, egotism, prejudice, and sapiens' moral, cultural, and spiritual superstitions. The true sages are the \"gen iuses of the mind\"—those who are able to generate ever ything with their mind, those who can raise themselves over opposite poles and reconcile all that is not reconcilable, understand all paradoxes, pene- trate into the essence of everything, and be aware of the hidden cause of all that is ma nifested as an effect. These sages are the possessors of tr ue wisdom, the kind given to King Solomon; they are the ones who exist beyond good and evil, who know the hi dden threads which connect all things. These sages demonstrate their knowledge in themselves, ap- plying it to the control and evol ution of their internal nature. They possess the \"philosopher 's stone\" with which they produce spiritual, not physical gold; with this noble project they help sublimate the animal in sapiens. Could it be possible that a group of men possess the se- cret of converting the entire body into a brai n? Would it be possible to think with a foot, a hand, the stomach, or the lungs?

One might ask where the di scoveries of these great brains are? To answer this, the reader needs to meditate on what he would do if he were a super-brain. Would his inter- ests be the same as before? Wo uld he persist in his egotism and anthropocentrism? Would he continue being interested in temporal things or would he feel more attracted to the eternal? In answering this, it is sufficient to co nsider the position and importance of the planet Eart h in relation to the rest of the Universe. Consider that the dead intelligence of the com- mon man is the in telligence of the Earth, while the mind or super-brain is celestial intelligence. If one were an ant and suddenly changed into a human being, would one retain the interests of an an t? (Be it known howev er, that from the viewpoint of universa l economics, the ant is just as impor- tant as man). Perhaps the highest intere st of the geniuses of the mind does not reside in great sc ientific discoveries, or could it be that once aware of the \"universal plan,\" these ge- niuses are not permitted to inte rfere with the natural development of events within an already determined span of time? To illustrate this, we recognize in Leonardo Da Vinci a great genius of the mind. We cannot comment on his inten- tions, which belong to the secret of his particular initiatic work. Without being aware of his motives, we cannot judge them. In summary, sapiens possesses a dead intelligence which only permits him to be \"special ized\" and always within the human cultural scheme. The Stellar Man has a live intelli-"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"T RUE I NITIATION 227 gence; he can transcend the terres trial level and evolve his \"Superior I.\" It is thus that there exists dead knowledge (ortho- dox wisdom) and a living knowledge (Hermetic science). One is a product of the brain; the other, a product of the super- brain. Further on, we will give instructions for the development of the super-brain. Point 4: TO LIVE IN THE PRESENT MOMENT To apply this point, it is indispensable to clearly understand the previous ch apter entitled \"To Be or Not to Be?\" where we explain the absolute key which, together with unveiling the mystery of being, illustrates the methods for overcoming sleep. That key is expr essed as follows: \"T he only reality is the present moment; there is no past or future, both are illu- sory\" (in the present moment th ere is no past or future, the past existed and the fu ture will exist). We al so said that \"the present is the exact point of union between the past and the future.\" There is a dividing line which separates fantasy or unre- ality from truth or reality. Th is line is time. Reality is the coincidence between the steps of the human being and his companion time. It is thus that our physical body is con- stantly in reality; it is object ive and occupies space. On the other hand, the occupant of the vehicle (the \"Superior I\") ha- bitually lives in unreality, th at is, beyond the wall that separates reality from fantasy. The unreal is something be- longing to a natural reality X, which finds itse lf projected into a different time from where it belongs. For example, if a human being belongs to the reality clas- sified as \"Delta-15,\" which ha s a time similar to an X clock,"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"228 THE STELLAR MAN but is then pr ojected into X 2 time, he evades re ality, living in a world which exists on ly in dimension B, which naturally his physical body has no access to, as he cannot raise his body to X 2 time. Therefore, if there are so many di fferent velocities of time, we must ask ourselves how many realities exist? The logical reply is that there are as many realities as there are ve- locities of time. Nevertheless, as we are physical ly constrained to Delta-15 time, we mu st adapt ourselves to this reality. If one lives in an unreal world with re spect to Delta-15 time, that is, with respect to human reality, it is the same as not existing at all, for the body woul d be that of a somn ambulist, an empty shell without an occupying spirit or \"Superior I,\" an entity, a mere spectator of a fa ntastic kaleidoscope. For example, what is the four th dimension? It is a world that actually exists, but only for those who possess a vehicle which can manifest itself in the temporal vibration of the fourth dimension. The aphoris m which says \"everything is illusion\" refers to th is problem, which s hould be interpreted as follows: \"Nothing is real for the one who is in absolute reality, as all that exists has reality only for those who are on the same vi- bration or time, since time is velocity and velocity is vibration.\" It is due to this principle that a \"ghost\" for us is just an illu- sion, and not a physical being. By \"ghosts\" I mean the energy remaining after a person's death. A thought has no concrete an d physical rea lity: we can- not weigh or see or bump into a thought. Nevertheless, for a man composed of thought-matter, thoughts would be visible and tangible. Why is it that our body cannot co llide with a thought? Because it has a different speed an d, therefore, a different reality."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"T RUE I NITIATION 229 As human beings we are the union of two forces of very different vibrations: • Mass energy or physical body • Mind energy or spirit This union has only one objective: evolution. Evolution is cosmic for the great human mass, and personal for the indi- vidual. The object of having a physical body is to evolve. When the individual does not ev olve due to indolence, dis- interest, or personal incompeten ce, he does not fulfill the prime objective of his individual life, and is only open to the possibility of becoming the \"sexual part\" of God, being con- verted into an anim ated instrument of physical creation. He suffers greatly in th is process: he ha s a physical body, but pays the penalty of losing the only personal justification for having it — individual evolution. The body and spirit belong to ve ry different realities, to two times which are distant or apart from each other. As a consequence, the spirit is not manifested on Earth, but re- mains in slavery or chained to the physical body, and must suffer the fantasies and dr eams experienced by the \"Psycho- logical I.\" Not being able to become located in the Delta-15 reality, the spirit lives constantly out of the present (outside of Delta-15). It is thus that the body loses its function as a ve- hicle of the spirit, remaining only an instrument of the Archons of Destiny, with the object of becoming one more worker at the orders of his ow ner. It should be explained that creation is accomplished in the Universe by means of the imagination of sapiens, which shapes all emotional, in-"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"230 THE STELLAR MAN stinctive, and intellectual states . This energy condenses in a remote future, becoming transf ormed into matter. This is why we can state that God is the Great Architect of the Uni- verse and that the human mass forms his laborers' army who, as payment, receives the gift of existence. This would not be such a terrible thing if sapiens had ac- cess to reality, although some th ink that the fact of being conscious of it and of not being able to change it, increases suffering. The only way to reac h absolute reality, to destroy dreams, and earn the right to one's own evolution is to make the body and the sp irit coincide at the sa me doorway or temporal communication so that together they may face reality. Upon ac- complishing this, the individual lives in two worlds as he has attained knowledge of two opposite realities: that of matter and that of spirit. Both are reconciled in a third reality, the one sought by the Hermeticist: the absolute reality, which al- though still material, is part of that which is divine, and being divine, forms part of that which is material. This is what we call being on this side of the dividing line (which separates reality and fantasy), to have one's feet on the gr ound and one's head in the heavens. This is very different from profane men, with their feet on nothing and their head in oneiric fantasy. In order to live in the present moment, the individual must have reached not only the creation of his \"Volitive I,\" but also its complete strengthening, as the \"Volitive I\" can be weak or strong. The \"Volitive I\" must oblige the \"Psychologi- cal I\" to concentrate on the pres ent moment. This is done with adequate discipline of th e imagination, a state of relax- ation, and with the perfect integration of our microcosm in an internal hierarchy und er the guidance of the \"Volitive I.\""},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"T RUE I NITIATION 231 It is important that our im agination should not wander, that we should overcome nervous tension, and that our en- tire being is under the control of the \"Volitive I.\" Further on we will summarize the practical a pplication of this, as every- thing is related, and if this were done in each chapter, we would have to di gress many times. Point 5: TO ACTIVA TE THE PHYSICAL BODY As the physical body represents the opposite pole from the spirit, it is obvious that it repr esents an \"obstacle\" for com- munication with our \"Superior I.\" Nevertheless, at the same time it is necessary to \"raise the vibration of our corporeal matter,\" which is done by making the body obey our will. To this end, let us briefly consider three principal elements: • Food • Breathing • Physical Exercise We will not discuss these points in detail, as they are not part of this chapter. We will only speak of them as some of the methods for destroying dr eams. Our recommendations will be very brief, because in th is case the only objective is to \"activate the physical body.\" Regarding food, we will on ly recommend abstaining from consuming dense meats \"of a low vibration\" such as pork, as well as practicing ve getarianism when the student must give special attention to hi s ascetic side in order to pu- rify his state of consciousness. With respect to alcohol, it is necessary to be very prudent in its use, as it is a considerable"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"232 THE STELLAR MAN organic depressor, and its effect is only notic ed after some time. It acts as \"super fuel \" which unnecessarily wears out the organism with no advant age whatsoever. If alcohol con- sumption turns in to a vice, it is a very dangerous element, as it breaks the individual's etheric protecti on or \"aura.\" This exposes the individual to cont act with demonic creations which exist on the lower astral plane (one of the vibratory planes; the lowest after the ma terial) which is clinically known as \"delirium tremens.\" Breathing should be considered in relation to absorbing more oxygen, that is, by practicing complete breathing. Begin by expanding th e diaphragm until co mpletely filling the upper part of the lungs and expanding the thorax. Inhale by expanding the abdomen, projecting it forward with some force until it is slight ly bulged. Continue to inhale until the lungs are filled, expanding the thorax and filling it while the abdomen is naturally flattene d. Upon exhaling, the ab- domen must be gently contracted to facilitate the elimination of residual air. Ten minutes of morning breathing contributes much energy toward activ ating the physical body. Physical exercise is indispen sable for the reactivation of our body, but it is necessary to do those exercises which make our cardiovascular system work, such as the various forms of aerobic exercises. A dded to this, each person can practice calisthenics according to his age. Also, it is neces- sary to practice an exercise of complete i mmobility every morning, which should be don e as follows: seated very straight on a chair, remain ab solutely motionless for three minutes. Once this is perfectly carried out, continue to the second stage, which is similar to the first but starts by tens-"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"T RUE I NITIATION 233 ing all the muscles strongly, clenching the fists and thinking \"I am awake,\" letting this idea fill the organism. The muscu- lar tension must last one minu te after which the muscles are completely relaxed and loose, and then complete immobility is maintained for five minutes, always with the fixed idea, \"I am awake.\" For this exercise to be completely effective, im- mobility must be absolute, without moving the muscles even one millimeter. The eyes should rema in open through- out the exercise. During the process of true initiation, we have already re- ferred to two very important stages, which are the creation of the \"Volitive I\" and the destruction of dreams. For the lat- ter we pointed out that it is ne cessary to fulfill five basic disciplines: 1. To stop lying 2. To stop dreaming 3. To learn how to think 4. To live in the present moment 5. To activate the physical body We will now approach the third stage, which is \"mental digestion.\" Common man lacks a mental stomach (mind) and therefore cannot effectively \"dig est\" acquired knowledge. In spite of the fact that we ar e speaking figuratively and sym- bolically, this simile closely reflects the ideal work of the intelligence, as it is equivalent to that of the stomach: to transform basic elements into \"nutritional essence.\" No mat- ter how much a person eats, if he does not assi milate it, the food eaten is of no use whatsoev er. The same occurs with the"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"234 THE STELLAR MAN intelligence of sapiens, who has become an intellectual glut- ton, devouring knowledge, which becomes integrated into the cerebral neurons without having been truly assimilated. In short, he is a hoarder of me ntal food which he never uses. Physically speaking, this is equivalent to an individual who stores food he will never eat. There is not only corporeal obesity but also intellectual obe sity, and it is curious that there are those who are proud of this expansion of their in- tellect. Man is convinced that th e more he stud ies, the more prepared he will be to learn th e truth. It has never occurred to him that perhaps the opposite is true. If we think about this just a little, ha ving understood the concept of program- ming, we will realize that to study more means more program; the greater the progr am the less the capacity for alertness; and less alertness means more automatism, less humanity, more unreality and fa ntasy. When an individual who lacks a \"mental stomach\" begi ns to study, the result is always the same: intellectual inflation and reinforcement and growth of programming. On the other hand, when the individual who has a mind studies, he genuine ly digests his intellectual food and therefore a real change and evolution is produced inside him. We have already addressed stages 1 and 2, which refer precisely to the formation of the mind; therefore, if the student carefully fulfills these, he will be in a condition to study and real ly assimilate knowledge. The philosopher's stone has traditionally been the sym- bol of mind, and as such always app ears as the key element for transmutation. When a stud ent has perfectly formed his mind, not only will he be in a condition to transmute him-"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"T RUE I NITIATION 235 self, but he will also be able to accomplish many other tasks of great Hermetic value. We must point out that ort hodox science has completely failed to address or even recognize the effects produced in a person who has achieved a perfe ct process of understanding. Psychology knows something about understanding, but is incapable of evaluating its im portance. This process, when perfectly accomplished, constitutes a magical-alchemical oper- ation which produces a ce rtain element in the body which is missing in sapiens, and which could be called consciousness. It is necessary to poin t out that in this stage of birth, conscious awareness is a material element whic h is present chemically in the bloodstream, and from its combustion spiritual gold originates, which feeds and en ables our essence to grow. Alchemy represents an entirely corporeal work in which the crucible is the body it self, the fire is passion, and the lead is the raw material. Alchemical \"sublimation\" is the lengthy work of transmutation of sapiens into a Stellar Man.

The traditional Egyp tian Sphinx, which has the head, neck, and bosom of a woman and body a nd paws of a lion, is a sym- bol of the animal na ture of the human being. It is she who blocks the way to the intrepid seeker of Hermet ic light. Never- theless, the Sphinx has wings to symbolize the fact that it is necessary to raise oneself thr ough one's animal nature, and not through the strength of the spirit as many people believe. Fur- thermore, this corresponds exactly to the image of Jesus Christ mounted on an ass, which repres ents the beast that must be tamed by the \"Superior I.\" In truth, if we feel an impul se inside us to soar toward higher planes, it is no t due to the spirit, but rather the beast. The beast is not bad in itself, but is only perverse in the measure in which it has taken into itself this characteristic from the common pool of human bestialit y (collective un- consciousness) which fo rms part of the ce ntral computer of the species. To understand this , we show the spirit and the beast depicted by two triangles, one descending and the other ascending.

The beast, on the contrary, looks towa rd the heavens be- cause, knowing it is impure, it struggles to re ach the purity that only the divine can give it.

The existence of these two forces, one ascending and the ot her descending, allows us to understand in a deeper manner th e superior role which the \"Volitive I\" must perform in managing spiritual energy, as well as the material force identified as the beast. Usually, those who arrive at an initiatic school make fun of the ordeals, characterizing them as mere barriers. Never- theless, as time passes, they ar e rudely shown their different faults. In spite of this, failure in some ordeals does not mean defeat, but rather a lesson that the indivi dual must learn; and until he does so, he will re main blocked by the obstacle. The extreme difficulty of the ordeals lies in their tremendous subtlety. These ordeals are ge nerally based on the individ- ual's internal failures which are beneath the threshold of his awareness, and which remain un known to him. This is simi- lar to what occurs with a person's defects; generally, he is completely incapable of observing them. The first steps taken by an individual who enters a Her- metic school are decisive, as he is prone to be guided by false and capricious impressions, arising primarily from a projec- tion of his internal problem s. Many times, the individual looks upon the school as an entity which is trying to use or pressure him in order to obtain something from him. He craves salvation or a guide to su ccess, but at the same time he does not want to let himself be saved easily, and he wishes to show that he is no t easy to convince or handle. The individ- ual does not realize that he himself is the only one interested in his own salvation (freedom from being used by Nature)"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"242 THE STELLAR MAN and if he does not free himself, no one will co me to his res- cue. Until he understands his real situation in the world, he will lack the necessary motivati on to fight for his own exis- tence, as this is what he is striving for afte r all. The only possibility of success resides in being able to visualize his true position in life before Nature and destiny, and in his ulti- mate use of the \"Volitive I\" as an instrument for fulfillment. We have seen the most incr edible things happen to sin- cere students. Sudden riches or love are often sufficient to make him stray from his path. Other time s, his loved ones turn into his worst en emies as far as initia tion is concerned; these loved ones are undoubtedly controlled by the central computer of the species. This is very much like some ap- prentices of sorcery who try to dominate Nature, but end up as its slaves. The difficulties which the student must face just to reach the meeting plac e of the brothe rhood on time, sometimes take on tragicomic overtones. The oddest things occur solely to prevent him fro m reaching the meeting, and the problem is that it is the individual who is \"sabotaging\" himself. The ass is a symbolic animal in Hermetic Art. It represents the negative animal nature of the individual; its basic keynote is stup idity, inertia, laziness, negligence, and irresponsibility. It is due to th is that when an individual makes a harmful mistake, it is said figuratively that he should not \"think as an ass\" or rather that \"the ass should not be allowed to think for him.\" Hermeticism also speaks of the \"path of the ass\" to desc ribe those who, after so much effort and hardship, and after covering so much ground, al- ways remain in the same place. In ancient times, asses were used to bring up water for i rrigation from springs or wells,"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"T HE O RDEALS 243 and the animal walked many m iles per day, but because this was in a circle, he always rema ined in the same place. Her- metic teaching states that only after conquering the ass is it possible to conquer th e Sphinx and soar on its wings to cos- mic space. The Sphinx is the vehicle of the Stellar Man. Regarding the candidate's gende r, it is necessary to state that for men the ordeals are mainly expressed through in- stinct, along with all the rela ted psychological and material situations and conditions. On the other hand, the women's weak point is situated in their emotional nature. It is due to this that the admissi on of women into \"i nitiatic schools\" has been traditionally prohibited, an d this is the reason why the Freemasons only admit women on \"ladies' nights.\" In an- cient times when women belonge d to initiatic orders, many brotherhoods were destroyed when one of the female mem- bers, under the influence of passionat e love, revealed the secrets of the order to enemy organizations. The Freemasons were original ly a Hermetic brotherhood formed by high initiates as a preparatory school for other higher-level work. Nevertheless, with the symbolic death of Hiram, Freemasonry lost the se cret of the rites and symbols such as the true meaning of the passwords. Hermetic tradi- tion was extinguish ed and there remains only the unknown language of the symbols. The li ght that existed has lost its Hermetic meaning, and only the philosophical significance remains. The brothers have fallen \"asleep\" with the passage of time, perhaps sung to sleep by their pride in having thirty-three degrees of Mas onic splendor.

But between entering Freemasonry and becoming truly twice born, there is a world of difference. It must be pointed out that true Schools of Initiation have never banned the entry of wome n into their ranks, and that women may also work in the Temple. The ordeals the candidate for initiation faces may be inter- nal or material. Material ordeals concern concrete situations, which arise from the reactions of Nature. Remember that Na- ture is internal as well as external, a nd tremendous internal conflicts are therefore produced . Two interesting events make a profound impression on the di sciple during the process of initiation. One is the gradual vision the candidate acquires of himself, seeing himself as he real ly is without subterfuge, ide- alization, or hypocrisy. Another is the gradual contemplation of the truth, the world, and its people. In the first case, the stu- dent suffers a profound shock upon seeing himself as he really is for the first time. This vision opens two pa ths to him: he can either accept or reject his true nature. If he rejects his true na- ture, instead of br eaking through the shell of his isolation from reality, the individual, te rrorized by the naked truth, builds up an impenetrable and indestructible shell of iron. There are many illusions (in the sense of that which is illu- sory) that the individual must overcome in order to evolve. This is carefully stated in th e well-known and beautiful book Light on the Path by Mabel Collins: Before the eyes can see, they must be incapable of tears. Before the ear can hear, it must have lost its sensitiveness. Before the voice can speak in the presence of the Masters, it"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"T HE O RDEALS 245 must have lost the power to wound. Before the soul can stand in the presence of the Masters, its feet must be washed in the blood of the heart. Life's truths are so terrible in their nakedness, that for a disciple to endure them in a well-balanced manner, he must have adequately prepared himsel f. It must be realized that Nature is completely cold and could not care less about the kindness of a monk or the perversions of an assassin. Within her bosom Nature conceives equally wheat and hemlock, healing herbs and poisonous plan ts. Neither the greatest ide- alism nor the most de spicable evil alter th e immutability of the laws of Nature. There are truths that are so dangerous, they are truly like \"a razor's edge,\" for if the student still re- tains the seed of egotism or evil, the vision of these mysteries will traumatize him to such an extent that he will never re- turn to normality. He rein lies a great sim ilarity with the case of our neophyte in Zanoni, although reality is always more deadly and less spectacular th an the theme of a novel. Many have gone insane upon glimps ing a truth wh ich was too un- bearable for those who have not been able to overcome their baser passions. Truth is only attained by the absolute naked- ness of the innocent purity of those who \"become little children.\" Truth is a double-ed ged sword: it raises up the pure and destroys the passional. In an Initiatic School, hundred s of different situations arise which test the integrity, pur ity, and decisions of the stu- dent. These tests range from lo ss of confidence in the School and the Master to a feeling of being used or cheated in one manner or another. Each indivi dual reveals his internal fail-"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"246 THE STELLAR MAN ings through his doubts and c onflicts. Thus, the one who has no honor firmly believes that th ey will oblige him to lose his honor; the one who is not free believes he will lose his free- dom of choice; an immoral indi vidual believes he would be obliged to violate mo ral rules; and a thief would complain of \"losing his integrity.\" Many feel they are passed over and belie ve there is fa- voritism and prejudice, or believe they are not being taught enough. Others, especially th e unfeeling egoists, accuse their companions of \"having lost all sensitivity.\" In brief, in a School, a series of vital situations is reproduced, much like in a laboratory, so the student can consciously observe the behavior of others and also take note of his own. In this set- ting it is also possible for the School to profoundly understand the student in orde r to better help him. Natu- rally, for this work to bear fruit it must be authentic, that is, the student must not pretend at any time, but must be hon- est and sincere, and his react ions must be absolutely authentic. It must be pointed ou t that each ordeal that is successfully overcome raises the disciple to higher states of awareness, allowing him to understand that which was pre- viously incomprehensible."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"XIV T HE O BSTACLES n contrast to the ordeals, obs tacles are not Nature's reac- tions but ordinary ba rriers, which all people have to face in order to evolve.

Hermetically, we call this foo lish romanticism, to differenti- ate it from the ideali sm of the poets.

The latter speak occult jargon and say that \"it is necessary to unfold on the astral plane, to open the thir d eye, or awaken the Kundalini,\" and due to their tremendous na ivete are sincerely convinced of the truth of their own words. THE DIFFICULTY OF SEEI NG ONESELF OBJECTIVELY Each person wears the banner of the qualities he most ap- preciates in himself. A person cannot avoi d projecting his ow n image to oth- ers, and judging ev erything according to his own concepts rather than in a free and experi ential manner. It is as if each day a person digested part of the world, only to afterwards vomit all that did not correspond to his image of what is pleasant, true, or positive. In his self-projection, man has cre- ated a God in his image and li keness, one he imagines as a kindly old man with a white beard.

CONFORMING WITH THE \"FLOCK\" This conduct gives th e individual the false sensation that all is well simply because he is doing what ev eryone else does and accepts. For the same reason, he does not dare to decide any- thing for himself, least of all to study or accomplish something not approved by \"offici al science.\" In this respect it would be interest ing to verify whet her hypnotism was any less effective before being accept ed by science, and whether its acceptance, in truth, made it more respectable and effec- tive. Following along this line, we see that in most cases respectability and morals only reflect the de gree of conformity with the flock. BEING DEPENDENT ON THE PASSIONS Passions express the individual' s baser animal tendencies, which exist alongside superior animal tendencies. The baser tendencies are manifested in the appetite of the corporeal mass, which seeks its own sati sfaction without considering the higher interests of the individual wh atsoever. Indolence, inertia, laziness, apathy, bitte rness, resentment, jealousy, envy, and lust, to name a few, manipulate man as a puppet, and he will be unable to free himself from this situation.

FEAR OF FREEDOM We know that sapiens fears freedom with the force of an irra- tional anguish. Deep down inside himself he knows that the Hermetic path will inexorably lead him toward freedom or salvation. But, does the individual r eally wish to be free? Generally, the greater percentage of the sapiens species prefers mediocre slavery to th e most glorious and brilliant freedom. It is for this reason that people search in life for something to become enslaved to, as th ey cannot stand the sensation of liberty.

Only those who have cons ciously reincarnated are able to do without a Master, or, if possible, have many Masters who will refresh the memory of the reincarnated. The one who has consciously reincarnated ce rtainly knows this, but this happens infrequently. The indications given here are of an elemental character, and their object is to shed light on the path of the student to- ward the truth, to guide him in his goals. Only a genuine Master is able to transmit to th e disciple the spiritual flame, the magical ferment which beco mes his occult power as an initiate. This is not a poetic abstraction, but something mate- rial, a concrete process which takes place between the Master and the disciple. Naturally this power does not free the student from his ascetic di sciplines; on the contrary, it obliges him to undertake them with greater perseverance.

To educate this intelligence it is necessary to submit its functions, to a certain extent, to the control of will, the \"Volitive I.\" The digestive system must be thought of as an intelligent being with which we can communicate, to which we can speak, and control. For this the following formula is used: \"You, intelligence of my digestive system, I order you to blindly obey me in all I say. I give you awar eness and in- telligence so you may perfec tly fulfill your biological functions. From this moment, my will shall be your will, as I am your god, master, and ow ner whom you mu st respect and obey.

Periodically it is n ecessary to fast for an entire day, and upon initiating this one must say: \"You, intelligence of my dige stive system, will abstain from all food for 'x' amount of hours, as this is my will and I order you to blindl y obey this mandate.\" If the student suffers from any hepatic ailment or any type of digestive disorder, he must try to cure it by reinforc- ing the intelligence of his digest ive system with all his will power.

For the educa- tion of this intelligence, the previous formula should be used. This formula does not vary for a ny of the other systems. Only the name and function of the corresponding element is changed. It is necessary to regulate the sexual function, sub- mitting it to one's will power in order to have sexual relations only when the \"Volitive I\" permits it, and at no other time. We must remember that this system is the seat of th e libido, a fact we can make use of to extri cate all the complexes we may have by working on this center of activity. For this it is neces- sary to make the respective in telligence reason, so that it may abandon its infantile activity and proceed in a more mature manner. This should be compleme nted by the practice of con- trolling the imaginat ion, which we will refer to under the respiratory system.

When a desire is not satisfied, a powerful force vibrates within the individual, but as soon as he obtains what he wants, this power is extinguished and a vacuum is pro- duced. There are those who pursu e a desire intensely for a long time, and finally attain fu lfillment, but far from making them happy, this fulfillment of the desire causes a state of deep emptiness, laxness, and disappointment. This occurs when the fuel which motivated the individual runs out, as desire provides the power which carries us to ward fulfill- ment. We have already sa id that each person has \"x\" amount of energy at his disposal during his life, and can distribute it among many things or concentrat e it on a few. Applying this concept to the subject we are addressing, it does not mean repressing or frustrating desires, but permitting their exis- tence only if reason considers them just and convenient, and allowing them to material ize when, how, and where the \"Volitive 1\" dictates. We could also apply this to th e principle of penitence, but from a different point of view. For example, we could sacri- fice one thing we greatly desire in order to obtain another of greater spiritual or moral value. This could also be applied to vices, denying satis faction of them th rough will power in order to obtain what we wa nt. For example, a person may say, \"I will not smoke because ...

It shou ld also be stated that it is more difficult to acc omplish projects that become publicly known than when we endeavor to keep them secret. The \"psychic battery's\" char ge is the nervous and psy- chological tone produced by th e magnetism which people accumulate and project; some in very small doses, and oth- ers with great potency. Magne tism is accumulated through conscious breathing and all practi ces of self-control. In fact, the more magnetic an individual is, th e more possibility he has of being a success in life. At the same time, it must be understood that the \"Volitive I\" concretely exists in the form of a strong magnetic field which must be constantly revi talized, as all action absorbs energy. It is necessary to remember that it is indispensable to economize the energy that has been concentrated, as the \"Volitive I\" requires fuel; it is continuously expending strength just like any other living being. A series of bad habits and co nflicts brings about a great expenditure of energy within the human being. Impatience, emotional conflict, unnecessary haste, mental rumination, the sense of guilt, anger, unnecessary or exaggerated laments, different kinds of frustrations, fear, disorder, and indolence all rob energy from the \"Volitive I.\" The Hermeti- cist must establish discipline an d internal order at all costs in order to match his conduct with the purposes he wishes to achieve."},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"260 THE STELLAR MAN In relation to \"action directed by will,\" the difference be- tween \"to desire\" and \"to want \" should be very clear.

Love that is passional is not love but on ly a selfish possessive force, which fights to retain an instru ment of pleasure. To clarify the true meaning of love, it is necessary to meditate on the axiom, \"love, and do what you want.\" HOPE Hope is the womb which collect s the seed, which it develops and gives form to. It is the counterpart of sex. It is the femi- nine soul in man and masculin e soul in woman. Through it we conceive and create.

One should meditate on the axiom which says \"the magician reigns in heaven and rules in hell\" (to rule in hell means having sufficient power to avoid being destroyed by satanic forces).

Sex: Instinct Also as above, there are three possibilities: • The instinct of the instinct • The feelings of the instinct • The intelligence of the instinct These nine possibilitie s form the number of man, and as man is triple, we may state this in the following manner: Man: 999 Beast: 666 (the nine inverted) It is thus that the number of the beast is manifested in sapiens in the following manner: Example No. 2: 1. Brain: Intelligence • The dream of intelligence (brain) • The fanaticism of intelligence (heart) • The bestiality of the intelligence (sex) 2.

Sex: Instinct • The bestiality of instinct (sex) • The fanaticism of instinct (heart) • The dream of instinct (brain) When the human being \"thinks with the number 666\" there is no possibility of reac hing the knowledge of truth. He is, however, able to perfectly execute marvelous works of good and evil. Furthermore, the works will be programmed and therefore can be tremendou sly dangerous for the human species and the individual hims elf. People always believe that good brings forth goodness, and vice versa, but in prac- tice this is not always true. In Example No. 1, it is ho ped that the student should reach integral thought in whic h there is a perfect equilib- rium between intelligence, feelings, and instinct. The formation of the \"Volitive I,\" in addition to the different dis- ciplines the student must accomp lish, will gra dually lead to the formation of a magnetic bi polar spheroid which extends from the head to the sex, the center point being the spinal column. This magnetic field is actually present in the Hermeticist and is the seat of his higher awareness; it is a force which re- sists dissolution by death, and it is through this magnetic field that the individual exists and thinks, even without a physical body. Observe the simi larity between this and our planet Earth. Summarizing the concept of what mind is, we can affirm that:"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"266 THE STELLAR MAN (a) Mind is the \"Volitive I. \" (b) Mind is a magnetic bipolar spheroid, which is formed within the Hermeticist. (c) Mind is the \"philosopher's stone.\" (d) Mind is th e whole body. (e) Mind is the super-brain. (f) Mind is celestial intelligence. (g) Mind is the integration of the superior faculties latent in the human being. The naive reader will probably ask how it is possible that mind is a magnetic sphere, if in point (d) it is said that \"it is the whole body.\" The answer is simple as the one does not contradict the other. The mind or super-brain is what permits the Stellar Man to reach true wisdom; that which within the individual is \"beyond good or evil\" ; the part of man which reaches eter- nity. The semi-sage, on the contrary, only accumulates knowledge {dead or unconscious knowledge, which is only useful for recognition in the world of sapiens) and uses his intelligence for temporal and limited aims. When common men think, they do so with their brain; the Hermeticist thinks with the mind. THREE BASIC OBJECTIVES As we have already pointed out, these three objectives are awakening, mental digestion, and the formation of the \"Voli- tive I.\" We have already spoken sufficiently on these points, but must again emphasize mental digestion as the most im- portant part of processing the information we acquire through study. When we learn perfect mental digestion, a"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"T HE \"V OLITIVE I\" 267 new world is opened before our astonished eyes, as we thus discover the real sense of writte n or verbal information, and the genuine meaning of art, music, and other forms of human expression. This capac ity of penetration which is reached through the mind is so extensive, that no matter what book we read, no matter what we do at a given mo- ment, we will always extract wise and beneficial lessons from our situations, as we will have learned to read the open book of Nature. Animals, plants, birds, and even stones will speak to us in silent langua ge, but we will understand per- fectly. Further, through the process of understanding, we will be in a permanent transf ormation into beings who are wiser and more consci ous. This will enab le us to help our fellow men, not by charity, donat ion, or politics, but in a su- perior way, teaching them to live wisely, teaching them to think and decide for themselv es, showing them the advan- tage of taking their lives in their hands and being saved by"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"268 THE STELLAR MAN their own efforts. Because the age of the Messiah has passed, the one who does not save hims elf condemns himself. Only the individual who is able to form his mind can appreciate the transcendental importance of this fact. THREE SUPERIOR OBJECTIVES We have pointed out three su perior objectives: deprogram- ming, initiatory death, and rebi rth. The three form part of one process and represent different degrees of it. Program- ming is the assembly of mechanical and automatic circuits, which rule the biological and psychological side of sapiens. Naturally, we do not wish to interfere with biological functions except as an effort to correct some anomaly; we only seek the indivi dual's psychological liberation, and for this it is necessary to r eeducate the mo tor capacity. We will explain very genera lly and simply what consti- tutes the basis of deprogramming: to exchange automatic circuits for conscious circuits. The individual is deprogrammed by submitting to the relearning of what it means to be awake. To understand this, it is necessary to bear in mind that mechan- ical circuits are also formed within the human being thanks to learning. It is thus that at a given moment the child starts to walk without any effort, du e to the automation of the cir- cuit, which has been formed by the repetition of voluntary movement. However, we maintain that the low level of alert- ness in which sapiens lives gives all learning an oneiric character; that is, he does not incorporate a superior state of awareness within himself. Ther efore, the lear ning is gener- ally of a mechanical character and reinforces the individual's program, progressively reduci ng his level of awareness and"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"T HE \"V OLITIVE I\" 269 making the possibility of his awakening to greater alertness even more remote. Paradoxical ly, the more a human being learns, the \"less human\" he wi ll become, as the potency and reach of his mechanical circuits will increase, making him more and more like a robot. Th is, as we have already stated, invariably annuls genuine inte lligence and lead s to absolute slavery or dependence on the program. IQ tests only deter- mine how well trained the indi vidual's intelligence is, along with the agility, coordination, and sp eed by which th e neuronal in- formation is synthe sized. Such qualitie s bring to mind the general characteristics of a co mputer. If perfect robots existed which could both design and apply intelligence tests, they would certainly obtain outstan ding performance, but they would only measure mechanical intelligence. Nevertheless, these robots could apply their ex traordinary \"intellectual\" ca- pacity to accomplish functions much more rapidly and efficiently than sapiens. Hermetically, we consider the human being a perfect robot. Therefore, we deny that his intelligence genuinely cor- responds to what shou ld be the superior intellect of a truly awakened and conscious human being. The deprogramming of the individual is obtained gradu- ally by means of an apprentices hip in a state of superior alertness, and gives birth to true intelligence, which leads to \"living knowledge,\" as opposed to the \"dead kn owledge\" of sapiens. Hermetic observati ons from the most remote ages have established that sapiens does not necessarily die when his spirit leaves his body as is th e usual process, but in many cases the body continues to live as a veritable zombie, in spite"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"270 THE STELLAR MAN of the fact that the spirit has moved on to a better life. A per- son can live 30 or 40 years unde r these conditions, leading an apparently normal life. The terrifying thing is that no one realizes this; no one knows that he is gr eeting, speaking to, or living with an authentic living cadaver. From the Hermetic point of view, a cadaver is not a physi cal body in which the biological life has e nded, but is the body without a spirit, as this spirit is the individual himsel f, the true \"I,\" the real indi- vidual behind the person. If people cannot recognize a cadaver, it is not at all surprising that they are not aware that they themselves and their fellow men do not truly think but that something thinks for them. This something, which is the source of their ideas, is also converted into the rudder and compass of their existence. We already know that this some- thing that thinks is the central computer of the species and the individual is freed from it when he becomes deprogrammed. Returning to eternal paradoxes, let us consider the enor- mous contradiction of the f act that an individual's professional preparation limits him intellectually. Instead of expanding the scope of his intelligence, only his cultural, technical, or professional program is furthered. No university student is prepared to withdraw from the power of suggestion imposed by the prestige and authority of professors, enhanced by the university's imposing image. Thus the student blindly accep ts all he is taught, and imi- tates the behavioral model of the prestigious professors. On the other hand, something absolu tely different occurs with the self-taught, who, intellect ually speaking, are generally on a much higher level than th ose who graduate from a uni- versity, as their programming is weaker. From the Hermetic"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"T HE \"V OLITIVE I\" 271 point of view we should always prefer self-taught knowl- edge to that acquired from prof essors, at least until present educational systems are modified. Referring once again to depr ogramming, we must point out that there is one stage which the disciple is able to cover by himself, and another more advanced and rapidly pro- gressing stage which can only be passed through with the help of a Master or instructor. The disciple's part refers basi- cally to reeducation of moto r skills, an effort to give awareness to movements. This can be practiced in ten- minute intervals and repeated as many times a day as desired. It is necessary to mo ve slowly, thinking about and feeling each of the movements being made. Moving slowly should be understood as \"moving a little slower than is ha- bitual.\" This means practicing a deliberate motor action. The consequence of this is an imme diate elevation in the level of awareness, placing the student in the \"present moment.\" It is necessary to reflect on the fact that th ere is noth ing which gives a stronger sensation of existing than the act of moving within a space. Walking shoul d be done consciously, moving the hands, arms, head, trunk, and eyes while thinking and feeling. Together with this exercise, one should meditate daily on the difference betwee n the \"I\" and \"John Doe.\" That is, per- son X should think that he is no t X, and look at X only as a puppet or vehicle of the \"I.\" It must be observed how X has feelings, ideas, impulses, and fear s, which in r eality \"are not his,\" but in fact are ab solutely foreign to his \"I.\" This prac- tice must be perfected until two absolutely separate beings with perfectly defined bound aries appear, until the practi-"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"272 THE STELLAR MAN tioner is able to state with co mplete certainty: \"I am not X,\" and be absolutely convinced of this. Another discipline that may be practiced by the student consists of controlling the five senses until he is able to see or not see at will, hear or not he ar at will, thus successively placing his senses under the contro l of his will. This exercise is extremely importan t but we will not elaborate on its bene- fits, since only those who a ssiduously practice will learn the secret. Regarding the part which must be accomplish ed with the help of a Master, we will only state that the Master can pro- gressively annul the disciple's circuits so that the disciple may rise above all that is mech anical. This is however, a long and delicate task, which may onl y be known to the person who has arrived at such an ex perience. The culmination of this stage is initiatic death. This is the dissolution of the per- sonality in the Hermetic sense, where personality is a synonym for the program. During this period, and until the rebirth is complete, the disciple really ceases to exist, psy- chologically speaking, living during the time it takes for rebirth with very basic elemen tal circuits which will not form an obstacle to his evolution. After his rebirth he will be called the \"twice born,\" and in this manner we understand the es oteric symbol of the birth of Jesus, as it is said that hi s mother was a vi rgin. Likewise, we may say that the rebor n \"is not born of woman.\" Once Hermetic rebirth has occurred, the individual starts to live an absolutely new existe nce, that is of an individual who has been deprogrammed and freed from the central com- puter of the species. For the first time, he has genuine"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"T HE \"V OLITIVE I\" 273 self-determination and autonomy; his thoughts belong to himself; his intelligence has ri sen to a higher level, and he has been freed from the cosmic-oneiric influence. Likewise, his soul has been cleansed, becoming again as pure and innocent as a child's. This, and only this, is true heaven, which can be found w ithin the individual. God, who is supposed to be in heaven, and into whose lap it is be- lieved that those of faith w ill arrive, is in truth the \"Superior I\" or Divine Spark, before whose luminosi ty the individual feels intimidated and at the sa me time transported to a con- dition of supreme peace and love. The angels in their heavenly choir raise paeans in honor of one who died in the world of the beast to be reborn into the world of men. One cycle has ended and another begun: the ascension of man to semigod. THREE SUPREME OBJECTIVES We have pointed out three su preme objectives : evolution, conversion into a Stellar Man, and transcending Maya. As we already know, evolutio n means the growth of our spiritual essence, freeing it fro m the tyranny of the beast. Our spirit should grow in size and quality. We will illustrate an evolutionary process in this simple diagram. In the first figure of Diagram 10, the spiritual essence is represented by the small dark point in the center, and the large circle represents the rest. In the second figure, we see the growth of the center point in relation to the rest, which symbolizes an evolutionary process. Here we wish to point out a profound difference between the Western Hermetic path and the goals sought by Yoga,"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"274 THE STELLAR MAN where it is intended that th e individual should be integrated into Nirvana, that is, reintegrated into the cosmic egg. As a matter of fact, we could call Yoga the path of the egg, and Hermeticism the path of th e spermatozoid . Through an enormous effort, the yogi reaches dissolution of his essential individuality which has taken so long to form . It is thus that he never reincarnates and join s the cosmic egg, awaiting a new wave of life. It is appropriate to ask what happens when this new wave of life arri ves after eons of time. Noth- ing is eternal, and when one who has been freed from reincarnation awakens from his eternal slee p, he is obliged to reincarnate. Thus ev erything begins again. On the other hand, the Hermet ic path is the conscious evolution of the spiritual individuality. It pursues the indefi- nite growth of the individual's spiritual essence, so that always conscious of his own identity, the individual evolves until his body as we know it is not suffici ent to contain his enormous spiritual power. At this point, his evolution con- tinues in celestial bodies, such as the planet Earth or others. It is completely impossible to conceive of the life of one of these beings and to imagine how they think, talk, feel, and move. In any event, it is usef ul to observe that a celestial sphere possesses a body basically the same as represented in the two figures, that is, the essence corresponds to the nu-"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"T HE \"V OLITIVE I\" 275 cleus and the rest to the physical body. Likewise, we can sur- mise the important difference wh ich may exist, for example, between the sun and a plan et of the solar system. To clarify what a Stellar Man is, it should be said that he is an individual who was a sapiens in the near or remote past. Through his own effort he was able to provoke a genetic and functional-psychological mutation in himself, which estab- lished the basis for his transiti on to the other extreme of the evolutionary spectrum. One of the poles of this spectrum is represented by Homo sapiens and the other by the Stellar Man, the name given to Hermeticists who have reached a high level of consciousness. A Stellar Man is not necessarily a Hermetic Master of wisdom, as this is a diffic ult specialty; but he is a man who, having surpassed his terraqueous condition, is fit to continue the study of the great mysteries of the Uni- verse and to choose his future destiny. There are many \"masters\" w ho have accomplished great things and have outstanding knowledge, but who are not Stellar Men. On the contrary, when a Stellar Man reaches Her- metic mastery he will always be a \"Master of Masters.\" With respect to the specializ ation a Hermeticist may fol- low when he is advanced al ong his path, only two of the most important possibilities w ill be mentioned, following the theme of Zanoni. These refer precisely to the path of Zanoni and to the path of Me jnour. The path of Zanoni is that of high politics, of those leaders who march at the head of the history of mankind; or be tter stated, are the creators of history and leaders of civiliza tion. The path of Mejnour is that of a Master of wisdom, which is the best known. It needs to be said that these individuals are very scarce, and there"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"276 THE STELLAR MAN are but few in the world, as th e extreme difficulty of their task permits only a few with th e necessary spiritual strength to choose this path . Even though gullible people see \"mas- ters\" everywhere, they are very scarce and are more carefully hidden than is beli eved. Those who show them- selves do so on ly for purposes of initiation. Some of these Masters, but certainly not all, transcend Maya, or the universal principl e of illusion. Th is means that they live above the disguised appearance of reality and that the most important events for the human race mean no more to them than the ebb and flow of Maya, an illusion created only to be destroyed and infinitely a nd repeatedly reformed, as the tide which incessantly fluctuates, always repeating the same cycle with practically impe rceptible change. With the supreme calm of absolute real ity, they imperturbably con- template the circus of human life, as Mejnour did in the novel Zanoni. It is fitting to meditate on the controversy which arose between two mythological Masters, Cagliostro and th e Count of Saint Germain. As is well known, Cagliostro was one of the fomenters of th e French Revolution, and the celebrated episode of Marie Antoinette's necklace was directly pro- voked by Cagliostro throu gh Madame de la Motte to unleash the revoluti onary process. The Count of Saint Ger- main, on the contra ry, was in favor of maintaining the royalty, and believed that the revolution was not necessary. What is interesting is the philosophical sta nd taken by each of them. Cagliostro maintain ed that the revolution would bring about an extraordinary evolutionary advance in the world. Saint Germain argued th at there was no hurry for the"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"T HE \"V OLITIVE I\" 277 evolution of the human masses, and that it would be the same if this evolution were slow or fast, as evolution is al- ways cyclical; one cycle ends and another commences. In order to underst and what it means to transcend Maya, we must recall the Principle of Mentalism: \"The Universe is mental; the only essential realit y is mind: the Universe is a mental creation and we live in th e mind of God.. . . All is in- finite, eternal, immutable, an d unknowable; all that which is finite, movable, and transformable cannot be the All, and as nothing exists beyond this, all that is finite must in reality be nothing.\" To transcend Maya means being fully and totally con- scious that all that is finite, movable, and transformable is illusory. It means to be able , in time, to project our con- sciousness toward the infinite, immutable, and eternal, that is to say, toward God."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"XVII T HE L IFE AND P OWERS OF THE S TELLAR M AN f we had the opportunity to meet and speak to a Stellar Man, we probably would not find him appreciably differ- ent from any other man. There is nothing more laughable than the physical appearance that some mystics pretend to find in the great initiates. Look ing at pictures of legendary Masters such as Jesus, Koot Humi, Morya, Serapis Bey, or others, some people expect to see extraordinary physical beauty as if the Masters were angels incarnate. This shows exactly how people idealize these men whose physical ap- pearance is in rea lity no different from any other man. The only things which expose them to the eyes of those who can see is the aura of strength and power which surrounds them, their brilliant eyes, their shin ing faces, and the harmonious vibration they project.

There are Rosicrucians and \"rosicrucians,\" and the initiate or student can only recognize the authentic member s through internal and not external signs. Here are the comments by Durville on Rosicrucians: Their existence, although historically uncertain, is sur- rounded by prestige that forces acceptance and wins admiration. They speak of manki nd as infinitely beneath them; their pride is great alth ough their exterior may be humble. They love poverty and declare that for them this is obligatory, although they may possess great wealth. They keep themselves apart from human affection and do not submit to it except as a c onvenient obligation which is imposed by their living in the world. They are very courte- ous to women, although incapa ble of affec tion and they consider women to be inferior beings. Externally they are unaffected and deferential, but the confidence in them- selves which fills their hearts is not radiated except before the infinity of the heavens. They are the sincerest people in the world but granite is soft in comparison with their im- penetrability. Compared to thes e adepts, kings are poor, at their side the wisest are stupid ; they never take a step to- ward fame, which they despise, and if they should become famous, it is in spite of them selves; they s eek no honors as no human glory attracts them.

Not being able to underst and their souls or their objective, the world declares that one and the other are futile. This portrait is far from being attractive or agreeable, but it shows the idea that sapiens has of Stellar Man. Hermeticism of which we speak in this book, sustains that the Hermetic initiate can acquire the follow ing privileges along his or her path of initiation: 1.

Freedom from Maya These powers place the Hermeticist on a much higher level than the ordinary and common man, and for this rea- son it is hard to really know a Hermetic Master, even though we may be his close friend and he tells us his most secret thoughts and feelings . From our position, it will be impossi- ble to adequately interpret or evaluate these Masters, and probably we will arrive at conc lusions absolutely opposite to the truth. One must take into account the purely spiritual condition of the Stellar Man. All his higher faculties are of a spiritual nature, and are the opposite of the worshippers or practi- tioners of astral magic who need not have awakened, nor least of all become deprogrammed, in order to carry out their spells. It is necessary to issue a warning that a great per- centage of those practicing magic fall completely into black magic, which we can define in one of its aspects as the use and projection of the body's mass en ergy without having previously been deprogrammed. All sorcerers' appren tices are generally men who are asleep and programmed. These are people who in their oneiric stat e have had the opportunity, for whatever reason, to gain access to Hermetic theory. This theory is gen- erally then used to satisfy thei r base passions or to live the agreeable fiction of passing for extremely evolved and power- ful beings.

Its worshipers are used by the beas t, from which they have not been freed, and they are us ed for its own dark designs. It is easy to understand that magical and spiritual are two absolutely different things, an d one never reaches the spiri- tual by way of the magical. On the other hand, there is no individual who is truly spirit ual who has no access to the magical. Magic without spiritua lity is always black magic. To un- derstand this, we must remember that spirituality does not mean adopting a spiritual attitude of purity, meekness, and love; it means, as we have already stated, succeeding in having the spirit manifest th rough one's own brain. For this reason, we must necessarily consider parapsy- chology as the joining of phe nomena involving the projection of energy, and which have absolu tely nothing to do with spir- ituality. It is not necessary to be spiritual to become a medium or to have premonition s. On the contrary, these phe- nomena take place in the lower astral realm and are related to the animal and passional part of the human being. Returning to the spiritual pow ers of the Hermeticist, we must state that his higher quali ties do not let him escape or elude material realit y; on the contrary, he must respect the laws of the All, as no one ca n go against the laws. From the moment he takes life in a materi al body, he mu st feed, sleep, rest, and entertain himself the same as any other person; he must suffer the same problems as any biological organism in a hostile environment.

Nevertheless, the Her- metic initiate possesses the secret of transmutation, and can, under certain circumst ances, create or tr ansform vital situa- tions in order to alleviate problems which afflict him, or to help other people with their difficulties. The Stellar Man is the possessor of truth. Many people are irritated when someone claims to possess absolute truth, deeming this an act of egocen trism and profound arrogance. Imagine for a moment that so meone could actually have ac- cess to absolute truth. Should this man keep silent forever and hide his knowledge? Or would it be his duty to help those who also desire to attain knowledge of the truth? With full knowledge of the trut h, we affirm that the Stellar Man possesses absolute truth and that no one can reach the ab- solute without first being converted into a Stellar Man. Therefore, only Stellar Men know absolute truth. This occurs not because a special person, hum an or divine, has revealed the truth to them, but because the special cerebral and intel- lectual forms they have a ttained through genetic and psychological mutation have enabled them to become aware of the naked truth which under the trance-like conditions in which sapiens lives, cannot be seen. It is necessary to under- stand that sapiens does not possess the organ of truth, but rather the organ of illusion and lies.

When God punished man by driving him out of Eden, he injected into him the organ of illusion so that he could reach the tr uth only by means of a titanic effort of will and intelligence and not by divine grace. This means that man can reach knowledge of truth and further evolve as he now has a physical body s ubject to transformation. Now, the fact that Stellar Man possesses abso lute truth does not remotely mean he knows everything. In fact, he is aware of all that he does not know. But he has the fundamen- tal science, which makes it possible to reach the knowledge of all he desires, if he dedicates sufficient time to this effort.

This is an extension of the He rmetic concept of \"as above, so below.\" The Stellar Man is just and impart ial. He possesses internal judgment, which enables him to alwa ys think impersonally, to judge without any personal bias , and without considering his personal convenience. A true sage is always just. The Stellar Man lacks passions. All his instinctive, emo- tional, and intellectual manifest ations are active, that is, genuinely self-generated. He receives stimuli and makes use of them, but this does not oblige him to feel certain things or to become ensl aved. He takes pleasure from what he enjoys. The Stellar Man is above death. If his physical body dies, the same does not happen to his spiritual individuality which survives this destruction a nd takes possession of another physical body, either returning to the material womb or tak- ing charge of an already grown body . This permits him to consciously reincarnate, becoming an avatar. The Stellar Man constantly renews himself. Every so often he modifies his standards of behavior to the point that some- one observing him co uld state that \"he has no standards of behavior.\" He knows the mystery of the Phoenix which is re- born from its own ashes, and when the time comes, kills itself, then being luminously reborn.

The Stellar Man is absolutely indifferent to the opinions of others. He is not at all concerned about the image he projects. Furthermore, he knows that under certain circumstances it is preferable to show a bad image as there will then be no possi- bility of being ido lized; in this way, he comes to know who his most sincere frie nds really are. He is friendly, but only with those who possess internal substance; he will not toler- ate superficiality, except if th ere are special qualities in a latent state. The Stellar Man is beyond good and ev il, and therefore his opinion of the events in th e world and its people differs considerably from the usual ones. At times he is very hard on those who have committed an error, which may appear insignificant, and on other oc casions treats with kindness those who in our opinion dese rve the worst pun ishment. No one knows his reasons, but his attitude is certainly never the result of a whim. The Stellar Man lives in the world of causes. By being in contact with the higher plane of causes, he himself places the causes he desires into motion in order to manifest concrete effects in his own life or in the lives of others. The common man must wait for things to happen, for the thing he calls chance to favor him. When this does not happen, he must be resigned to live with the effect s of causes he is completely unaware of. The Stellar Man is truly human.

The Stellar Man has no political ideology. He is a human- ist whose desire is for all huma n beings to attain spiritual evolution. Observe th e difference between revolution and evo- lution. Revolution indicates rotation, a cyclical repetition. Everything changes, but with the passage of time, every- thing returns to what it was in the beginning. Evolution, on the other hand, means an as cending spiral, where a pro- found transformation that is not superficial takes place. The Stellar Man rejects all that impedes the individual's freedom, but does not condone th e irresponsible us e of freedom. He believes that the individual hi mself must deserve to be free, and should not expect it as a gift from society or God. The Stellar Man may become ill and die like any other person, as his physical body is also subject to the law of ma- terial transformation. Nevertheless, if he so desires, in the majority of cases, he can transmute illness into health in a progressive and gradual manner. The greatest danger for him lies in the negative atti tudes taken by other people he has helped at some time, and whose Karma he has absorbed, as this provokes a real illness of mental origin, which is ex- tremely difficult to cure. Recall that Jesus could not heal himself in spite of being the savior of mankind. The Stellar Man is not a hermit who keeps himself apart from the ups and downs of life. Far from being insensitive, he lives more intensely than most people. Nevertheless, he can choose to be hard er than a rock or a diamond, or on the contrary, love with all his be ing.

It is as if he coul d play a piano with an immense keyboard with thousands of different notes. The Stellar Man is introverted, but not selfishly so; his in- troversion is due to the extraordinary richness of his internal world. His consciousness is so rich that it is painful for him to leave that veritable heaven to perform in this material world. This is especi ally painful for the Master of Hermetic wisdom, or for the one who has a ssumed the responsibility of transmitting knowledge, for every authentic Master is, in a certain manner, crucified, symbolic of Christ. There is a Her- metic-Rosicrucian axio m which says that \"it is necessary to decrucify Christ (the 'Superior I') to crucify the heart (emo- tional egotism).\" No one knows th e sacrifice it entails for an individual who has reached he aven to descend once again into the dark world of mud. However, this action obeys the true wisdom of the Polarity Pr inciple, for if the individual were to be permanently in h eaven, he would eventually de- generate as his virtue would encounter no obstacle. It is for this reason that the Stellar Man lives in heaven but has his feet on the earth. As we have already stated, he is an inhabi- tant of two worlds; he lives simultaneously in heaven and on earth; he is human and divine. The Stellar Man knows the secrets of universal magnet- ism, and this permits him to vitalize himself and project his consciousness to his surroundings. Every highly developed Herme tic initiate has a tremen- dous magnetic irradiation which surrounds his body like a sphere of energy, and is the extension of his mental power."},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"T HE L IFE AND P OWERS OF THE S TELLAR M AN 291 This sphere of magnetic ener gy occupies a space and corre- sponds in size to the initiate's spiritual development. It is said that Jesus Chri st possessed a powerful magnetic sphere that engulfed the entire Earth, and that this had an enor- mous influence on the human race. This teaching makes it poss ible to understand why \"God is everywhere,\" as his irradi ation fills the entire universe. The Stellar Man practices the secret of the evolutionary cir- cle. We have already referred to the circle of the ass, the long road walked by the human beast who always remains in the same place. This circuit gives him no benefit or evolution. On the contrary, the \"evolutiona ry circle\" consists of the wise handling of the Polarity Principle, where the initiate os- cillates between Earth and he aven, alternately polarizing and depolarizing himsel f. In this way, a perfect equilibrium is maintained, achieving the wisdom of one who accustoms himself neither to the light no r darkness. His long journeys always take him to th e starting point, but with considerable evolution. As an example of th is, we will cite the process so beautifully described by Herman Hesse in Siddhartha, where the protagonist fights tirelessly for a long time in order to be- come separated from the human horde and attain his own individuality. But once he does this, he must suffer all kinds of trials and diverse experiences to finally reach a union with the whole. But what a difference, what an infinite abyss sep- arates the Siddhartha in the beginning from the sage at the end: evolution had been complete d.

Again we must meditate on the Revolt of the Angels by Anatole France. The Stellar Man has his own morals. Celestial morals are different from the morals of terr estrial man. Celestial morals are absolute and invariable with in the flexibility of internal judgment, while terrestrial mo rals accommodate themselves to the customs of th e dominant culture. If one day a canni- balistic culture should be dom inant, cannibalism would be considered perfectly moral and correct, and, furthermore, perhaps those who did not conf orm to it would be punished. When we state that the morals of the Stellar Man do not vary, we do not mean they are rigid. In spite of constant transformation they remain inta ct in their essential nature. On the other hand, the Herm eticist considers many of sapi- ens' attitudes as immoral. Irres ponsibility, abuse of power, emotional blackmail, apathy, hypocrisy, blind conformism, self-pity, cerebral programmi ng through the media, and glo- rification and applause are only a few of the immoral attitudes and customs of sapiens. Hermetic ethics are on an infinitely higher le vel than the accommoda ting rules of con- duct of the common man. The power of the Stellar Man does not emanate from his third eye, nor from chakras or the Kundalini. Nor does he pos- sess parapsychological abilities. As we have already stated, Hermeticism maintains that parapsychological qualities merely represent the displacement and projec tion of mass en- ergy; therefore, the more bestia l the individual, the better chance of success he has.

There is no spiritual merit in this; it is only unconscious sorcery. The power of the Hermeticist eman ates from a spir itual force, from purity, the domination of his passions, from the subli- mation of his animal energy, and from the rectitude of his intentions. The Stellar Man may have great material problems in his earthly life, as his enormous difference in level from other people makes them instinctively look at him wi th a lack of confidence and fear upon percei ving a strange power they cannot classify. Persecution a nd economic failure may turn into serious obstacles for th e Hermeticist, whose \"kingdom is not of this world\" and wh ose skills are not outstanding on this earth where social and economic success are for those who possess a specific psychological makeup. Nevertheless, in spite of the fact that th e Hermeticist can fail in some things, this experience will never oppress him, and if he strives sufficiently, he will always end up as a conqueror. The Stellar Man does good works, but \"is careful to whom.\" He helps to the limit of his strength, but only for those who, in his estimation, truly merit help . He believes that helping those who lack merit means to truly harm them. If the support offered is wasted or not fully utilized, he helps two or three more times, but then no more. The Stellar Man can be a difficult pe rson to understand, or the most agreeable person in the world. As he is used to living in a world of lies, hypocri sy, cheating, and falseness, it is a shock to some individuals who are friendly with a Stellar Man, that he is absolutely genui ne, natural, and authentic, without hidden corners or attitu des of any kind.

However, after his mutation into a Stellar Man is accom- plished, he has ended his ascension to Mount Olympus, and is one more inhabitant of th e sacred mountain, a semigod who does not as yet desire abso lute divinity. Nevertheless, his studies of the mysteries of the Universe never cease, for they can never be completely known. It may be thought that this pa th is much too individualis- tic for an era in which the worl d is moving faster each day toward collective structures. Fo r those with this view, it needs to be pointed out that if a person does not first acquire his own individuality, he is really only an appendage of the masses; he is nothing more than one of the elements forming a circuit which in turn is part of the great machine. We understand that there ar e individuals who have per- sonally failed, and endeavor to fuse their undesirable \"I\" with that of the collective of the mass. But there is also an opportunity to emancipate and develop a \"Superior I\" to reach complete fulfillment and maturity.

What a difference there is between bei ng incorporated into mankind because of an inability to be free, and joining up with hu- manity after having attained freedom! It is interesting to consider that sapiens fears freedom, since this involves the only thing an animal within a flock cannot possess: intelligent indi viduality. For this same rea- son sapiens endeavors to join movements which do not demand any thinking or deci sion-making. Conversely, the Hermetic path obliges the indivi dual to take the responsibil- ity of his life into his own hands, instead of transferring it to social groups. From the philosophical point of view, one who has not first achieved his own individual exist ence can do nothing for the world and its people. One who is not, has nothing to give.

There is nothing more daunting than taking stock of what has been gained in life, beyond subsistence, suffering, enjoyment, or what one has done for his fellow men. The naive person can easily fill the credit column with his profes- sional titles, his material possessions, wealth, family, or knowledge obtained. Nevertheless, the cold reality is that the individual is not the owner of anyth ing, unless he is certain that what he possesses will endure. Under ordinary circumstances he can only make a list of th e things life has given him to handle, and even in this case he does not know when this mandate will expire. In truth, the indivi dual only gets out of life, for himself, what he can keep indefinite ly, beyond deat h. Obtaining something for oneself means having a purpose in life; it means taking possession of something intimate and per- sonal, which is, after all, the fruit of life. Everyone should ask himself, \"What have I obtained from life? Is it sufficient just to go along with what life brings? Do I really possess what I believe I have obtained, or will it vanish tomorrow like a soap bubble?\" Many may think that this kind of reasoning is very self- ish, but we must consider that gaining nothing for oneself is just as foolish, or more so, th an excessive selfishness.

This same concept can al so be applied to the \"eternal torment of the fires of hell.\" Many people laugh at Herme ticism, occultism, and all things esoteric, but generally none of them have had any di- rect experience in the matter, and only speak from hearsay or prejudice. Some are intellect ually proud and use their rea- soning to discredit Hermeticism.

It is sufficient to analyze individual motivation in depth to understand that everything take s place under in- ternal or external pressure. Ideas, feelings, impulses, or actions are always compulsive; they are never born from an act of superior and free reasoning. The usual reason for upholding the idea of one's own freedom consists in the argument of showing a long list of all things accomplished in life. Neve rtheless, it should be asked, were these things done by our own desi res, or were we obliged to do them in spite of ourselves? Did we desire a cer- tain thing, or were we obliged to desire it? There are a few very simple reflections, which should lead any individual who meditates on them to reach the con- clusion that sapiens' scale of values is tremendously distorted. Here are some of these reflections: • Science does not bring true happi ness to the human being; it only provides comfort, pl easure, and technology. • Intelligence does no t develop or form content in a person. • The internal nature of the human being has not appreciably evolved during the co urse of history. • Man has no knowledge of the gr eater portion of his internal nature. • The human species has no one with whom to compare it self, only animals; therefore, th ey have no point of reference for their own worth or their real position in the cosmic scale."},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"G ENERAL O VERVIEW 301 Each person must reach his own conclusions on these thoughts. It is necessary to consider th at Hermeticism is not solely dedicated to showing how bad sapiens is, or how insignificant he is, but that it has a well-de fined plan for the human race. Pointing out the real position of sapiens as a small animal of little importance in the face of universal grandeur, and whose only value is that he possesses the divine spark, has a cre- ative and not a destructive objective. We attempt to encourage a person, through re flection, to see the unbarred cell in which he lives, as this is the only way that the desire to escape will be bo rn in him. While an individual believes that all is well and that he himself is very well, there will be no possibility of real evolution. This is the reason why many mystics suddenly feel spiritual restlessness after having gone through tremendously pain ful experiences which came as a positive shock, awakening them from their somnambu- listic lethargy. The object of suffering is to awaken the individual's consciousness. Neve rtheless, there are many so deeply asleep that suffering only further brutalizes them, and is absolutely unproductive. There are many who have a pu rely devotional attitude toward Hermeticism, thinking that it is sufficient to be very spiritual to progress along the path, and that these spiritual individuals (according to their own opinion) will be the best prepared to ascend to higher levels.

Another enormous obstacle for people is that it is necessary to work very hard as Hermeticism is the path of self-salvation, and out of lazi- ness and indolence, one does not wish to save himself. People prefer to be saved by Christ even if this should only be a figment of their deluded br ains; or to be saved by magic or by the crew of flying saucers. One of the reas ons people do not make a decision to save th emselves is because they have no idea what they have to be saved from, belie ving that on earth, everything is just as it seems. Professional occultists or eternal students of esotericism live in the hopes of one day finding someone wh o will open their third eye, for example, in the belief that therein resides all magical secrets. For them we would say that the third eye only gives them a vision of th e human being's energy projec- tions without even remotely offering them any spiritual progress or advancement. Furthermore, we must mention the purely symbolic nature of the supposed operation of the opening of the third eye, under which Lobsang Rampa hid the true mystery of what the Hindus call Maya Virrupa, whose most approximate translation is the path of illusion. The fabulous unicorn, the myth ical animal with a horn on its forehead, represents what we are referring to. One who wants to act with his third eye must develop a horn in the middle of his forehead.

The eternal aphorism \"as above, so below\" confirms this fact. If we can so frequently deceive ourselves in the physical world using the senses we freely control, there is even more likelihood to deceive ourselve s upon using such difficult and restricted faculties. The real importance of unfoldi ng is something we have spoken little about, and which could be called Hermetic un- folding. This consists of being conscious simultaneously on two planes: physical and spiritual, in he aven and on earth. It is thus that the Hermeticist rise s above himself upon becoming divided into two persons, both of which simultaneously have \"their eyes open .\" It is said that in this way the Her- meticist obtains the power of pow ers, which is uniting earth with heaven. Of this state we will describe just one phenom- enon which is very curious a nd incomprehensible to the ordinary individual, and that is to simultaneously perceive two extremes. If this can be understood, the individual will be sad and happy at the same time, simultaneously. Pleasure and pain, serenity and agitation, attracti on and repulsion, and life and death are experienced at the same time. It must not be believed that this experience produces an average without differenti- ation.

The truth is that no benefit would be gained by a pe rson through this touted awakening of Kundalini, except perhaps an intense creative euphoria that has nothing to do w ith spiritual progress. We must understand that true evolution cannot be im- provised in any way, and that no one in the Universe can attain it without a slow, sustained, and vigorous process of self-fulfillment. There are those who pursue magical powers such as clair- voyance with tremendous persev erance, without stopping to think whether it is really benefici al to them or not. As an ex- ample, one of the easiest things to attain is what is commonly called second sight. For this we will give the method, although we honestly trust that no one will use it. To attain second sight it is sufficient to become a medium and endeavor to develop medium istic faculties, easily done by means of the collect ive suggestion whic h takes place during seances.

Trad itionally, in clas- sic occultism these are called astral shells; they are the bestial principles of individuals whic h survive for some time after death, and which need to ab sorb and feed on magnetic en- ergy from living beings, producing a type of vampirism.

He re lated to them his spectacular visions during which there appeared prehistoric beings who spoke to him. In a short while, five or six of the group were seeing things similar to this, for the first time in their lives. This is an example of magnetic contagion. Many who have atta ined power or great riches scoff at spiritual things, alleging that there is nothing their money cannot buy, despising the philosopher, believing he has something to sell. Protected by their wealth, they believe they have attained the pinnacle of their ambitions.

Perhaps in the near future important adva nces and discover- ies will occur in the fiel d of measurement of yet undiscovered cerebral rhythms. The most important of these is the rhythm of superior awareness, which appears in people possessing a high level of awareness, the result of Hermetic work upon them selves.

Men who pr eviously were great leaders might be relegated to the lowe st categories upon verifying, without any doubt, their absolute lack of a state of superior alertness and internal judgment, which is the very condition from which a high level of consciousness is derived. On the other hand, simple men, with minimal culture and a very elemental intelligence would possibly occupy the highest positions. In the last in stance, this cerebral examina- tion to determine the level of awareness would establish the degree of the individual's spiritual age, translated into con- cepts of evolution, wisdom, and spiritual perfection.

Any catastrophe predicted for the near future could be annulled by a decisi ve or important upheaval in the behav- ior and spiritual life of the human being. In this respect, as in any ci rcumstance which pretends to predict the future, the Hermeticis t is more interested in cre- ating the future than in predicting it. We hope that in the nearest possible future, the scientific measurement of \"levels of cons ciousness\" will become a re- ality for humanity, thus signify ing a new dawn for Mankind."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"Other books published by John Baines can be ordered through the publisher: _____ The Secret Science ISBN 1-882692-01-2 $12.95 _____ The Stellar Man ISBN 1-882692-04-7 $13.95 _____ The Science of Love ISBN 1-882692-00-4 $12.95 _____ HypsoConsciousness ISBN 1-882692-02-0 $9.95 _____ Morals for the 21 st Century ISBN 1-882692-03-9 $18.95 Books are also available in Spanish, Bulgarian, Russian, Italian, Latvian, German, and Portuguese.
