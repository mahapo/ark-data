Have you accomplished any of your goals yet? Are there any of your goals that you no longer want? Please make a new list of all your goals, and a new top five. It's perfectly all right if nothing has changed. Please write them all out again, completing the workshop below. AETHYR- Spiritual goals, your life's work FIRE- Goals for your your Will, Personal power, desires, creativity and sexuality WATER- Emotional goals, feelings and relationships AIR- Intellectual goals, goals about your ability to communicate EARTH- Financial goals, physical appearance Aethyr: 1. _____________________________________________________ ___________ 2. _____________________________________________________ ___________ 3. _____________________________________________________ ___________ 4. _____________________________________________________ ___________ Fire: 1. _____________________________________________________ ___________ 2. _____________________________________________________ ___________ 3. _____________________________________________________ ___________ 4. _____________________________________________________ ___________ Water: 1. _____________________________________________________ ___________ 2. _____________________________________________________ ___________ 3. _____________________________________________________ ___________ 4. _____________________________________________________ ___________ Air: 1. _____________________________________________________ ___________ 2. _____________________________________________________ ___________ 3. _____________________________________________________ ___________ 4. _____________________________________________________ ___________ Earth: 1. _____________________________________________________ ___________ 2. _____________________________________________________ ___________ 3. _____________________________________________________ ___________ 4. _____________________________________________________ ___________ Now, please go back and set a time frame for each of your goals. Decide for each goal whether you want to accomplish it in six months, a year, two years, five years, te n years etc. and write this tim e frame in the small line to the right of each of your goals above. Please choose your top five goals and write them dow n in any order. They can be from any categories. 1. _____________________________________________________ ___________ 2. _____________________________________________________ ___________ 3. _____________________________________________________ ___________"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"4. _____________________________________________________ ___________ 5. _____________________________________________________ ___________ For each of these top five goals, state specifically what you want.

Please take a moment to chunk down your goals into several increments or steps. What will the intervening phases between now and the complete accomplishment of your goals be like. In other words, if your goal is to become president of a large corporation you might chunk it down something like this: learn about corporate America, get a job at corporation, get MBA, move into executive position, perform amazingly in position, innovate company, take over. You may create as many steps or chunks as you like for each goal. 1. a.________________________________________ b.________________________________________ c.________________________________________ d.________________________________________ e.________________________________________ f.________________________________________ 2. a.________________________________________ b.________________________________________ c.________________________________________ d.________________________________________ e.________________________________________ f.________________________________________ 3. a.________________________________________"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"b.________________________________________ c.________________________________________ d.________________________________________ e.________________________________________ f.________________________________________ 4. a.________________________________________ b.________________________________________ c.________________________________________ d.________________________________________ e.________________________________________ f.________________________________________ 5. a.________________________________________ b.________________________________________ c.________________________________________ d.________________________________________ e.________________________________________ f.________________________________________ Once you have done this, think of one little easy thing that you could do right now to begin the process of accomplishing each of these five goals. It doesn't have to be a big thing. If you want to learn Japanese, you could get a book or look into a continuing education class. If you want to buy a corvette, you could send away for a brochure. Don't worry about whether these goals are financially or emotionally out of reach for now. Simply begin the process, and you will discover the way to accomplish your goals as you progress in the New Herm etics. Please write below something you can do to begin the process of accomplishing your top five goals. 1. _____________________________________________________ 2. _____________________________________________________ 3. _____________________________________________________ 4. _____________________________________________________ 5. _____________________________________________________ Within the next week, please be sure to do these five small things. You will set in motion massive forces in the universe. Now, choose your number one goal for now, the thing that is absolutely most pressing for you to accomplish. If it is a big goal, then write down the very first simple part or chunk of it. 1. _____________________________________________________ Please make sure that you accomplish this in the next two w eeks. This will really begin to move the forces necessary to accomplish all of your goals. Session 2 - Exploring Archetypes - Tarot Trumps The purpose of this tool is to get in touch with the universal archetypal energies depicted in the trumps of the Tarot Deck. These cards make up a fairly complete set of archet ypes for you to work with. By beginning to understand the components of these archetypes and thei r expectations of you, you will gain access to much greater understanding of your own unconscious needs and desires. When you are asking these archetypes what they need from you, be sure that you really listen to the answers you receive, and think about what thei r answers mean. These answers have the power to transform your life instantly if you listen. Allow yourself to be open as you experience these personalities, and do not try to force them to conform to your conscious expectations."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" You can choose cards randomly, use specific tarot cards that you are interested in exploring, or you may choose to explore the major arcana or trumps in order, from 0-22 or from 22-0. You will need to work with all of these archetypes eventually, but you may approach it from whatever direction you prefer initially. It is recommended for the purposes of the New Hermetics that you use the Rider-Waite, Thoth, BOTA or New Hermetics Tarot deck. The images in these cards represent the archetypal forces in a fairly pure and unadulterated way (with exceptions of course). All of the trumps of the Tarot are below, and recur three times in this workbook. You may approach them in any order that seems best to you, and you do not have to feel like you need to record visions of all of them three times. You can also do other parts of this workbook at the same time, coming back to work with these archetypes as often as you like.
