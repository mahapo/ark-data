We must understand that all things exist as energy even beyond the ordinary physical dimension to the realm where current scientific instruments cannot measure its rate of vibration. All things exist as energy from the lowest rate of vibration, the densest physical condensate of matter all the way to the highest rate of vibration in the universe, The Source, God. The Entire Universe is a Single Super Spectrum of Universal Energy . Some people have the perspective that the physical universe of matter and energy was created and therefore may be destroyed. Information is uncreated and therefore indestructible and eternal. The bible says that in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God and the Word was God. The Word is Jesus Christ and the Word is also Information. Hence the concept of the x, y and z parameters of reality. Matter, Energy and Information (DNA, universal code, intelligent design). But Einstein says that energy can neither be created nor destroyed. It is merely converted from one form to another. The Universal Equation E=MC2 does not mean Matter is converted Energy. It means Matter is Energy. Matter is Energy. Energy is Matter. So actually, the physical universe was “created” merely by the process of energy changing from one form to another . The creation and cessation of all things physical is simply manifestation and unmanifestation. Quantum physics states that something can actually come into existence only when it is observed. That means that something only exist because a mind first thought it into existence . Everything exists primarily as a quantum potentiality or Quanta. When something is observed, Quanta which is Energy come together to form subatomic particles, and in turn atoms, then molecules until finally something manifests in the physical world as a localized space-time event that can be observed by the five physical senses. This Energy is also conscious and infinite, therefore it is actually Infinite Living Mind! Everything in the Universe has its being from this infinite intelligent Energy. Imagine that every time this Intelligence moves or thinks an icicle is formed in the water , exactly corresponding to the thought. We might have countless numbers of icicles of different forms, colors and sizes but these icicles would still be water . If we could heat the whole mass, it would melt, and all the forms would again become fluent. Nothing would have changed but form. This is all there is to matter. Matter is Spirit in Form. Subatomic particles are simply energy packets . You are a cluster of energy, so is everything else. A cluster of energy is always in motion, moving and changing to form new configuration at every moment. The table that is in your dining room is not as solid as it appears to be. On a highly magnified level, you would realize that it is in constant flux, “losing” and “gaining” billions of energy packets, but intelligently maintaining the overall “look” of a table. There is a consciousness that keeps the energy in that particular form . All Matter is Energy In-Formation. When something is no longer observed by consciousness, it will cease to exist by unmanifesting back into a state of quantum potentiality or Quanta, Energy. That’s the reason why the bible says that it is Christ (The Superconscious), who holds all things in the universe together . Scientist says that all the electrons"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6 and subatomic particles of an atom are held together in their precise position and orbit by an invisible force , by which without it, everything would fall apart and reality as we know it, would cease to exist in an instant. Christ the center of the universe, whose center is everywhere but circumference nowhere. Christ is the Superconscious, Information and infinite intelligence. Ultimately all matter, energy and information are one and the same. All matter is energy, all energy is information. Information is thought, thought is consciousness. Consciousness is Mind. The Universal Construct is Mind . Mind is Reality. Reality is Mind. The entire Universe from the Source, The First Cause, God is Energy vibrating relative to the frequency of The Source, The Source being the very centre of the Universe of Energy and the physical world being the outermost shell , the physical three dimensional Universe as observed by means of the physical senses, existing at the lowest rate of vibration and the highest density. The physical Universe of matter represents only a tiny fraction of the Universe of Energy and vibration in its entirety. All Energy is influenced by thought and structures itself into taking form as an observable effect. Everything that happens, has happened and will happen in the entire Universe, first originated as a thought originating from the Mind of a Being , which in turn has its corresponding effect on Energy and becomes a corresponding and potentially observable effect. The Ultimate act of Creation by the First Cause, The Source, God of the entire Universe in all its glorious spheres, planes and dimensions originated in the very beginning as a thought in the Mind of God. It can be truly said therefore that we all exist as “expressions”, within the Mind of God , made in the true Spiritual image of God. So by seeing things from a unified perspective , we know that the physical state of matter and energy are “created and destroyed” by being converted from one form to another. All things preexist in spiritual form and are converted to physical form and back. Hebrews 11:3 “Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear”. God is Mind. Mind is Totality."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7 The Observer Creates Reality simply by Observing The most astounding experiment of quantum physics in recent scientific discovery is probably the double- slit experiment. It is the experiment that shows the entire universe exists by being experienced . To describe the double slit experiment, think of a tennis ball shooting machine that shoots out tennis balls that travels across space and hits the net. Now think of the ball shoot machine being shrunk to the size of the quantum level where instead of shooting out tennis balls, it now shoots out extremely tiny particles called electrons. Those electrons travel through vacuum and hit a wide screen which marks their positions. Imagine another smaller screen with single vertical slit in the middle that is placed between the particle launcher and the wide screen. Some of the electrons will pass through the slit and hit the wide screen behind it and some will be blocked. What we will see on the wide screen is a vertical column marking the area where the electrons have hit it. Next, instead of a single slit we use double slits. So now the electrons can pass through either one of those slits to hit the wide screen behind. What we are supposed to see is two vertical column marking the area where the electrons will hit on the wide screen. But the strange and amazing thing is, we do not see that. Instead what we see are several vertical columns a small distance apart from each other appearing on the wide screen. Imagine a swimming pool with a screen with double slits in the middle and a wide screen at the end. When a ball is dropped into the water in front of the double slit screen, it causes a circular wave that ripples outwards in all directions. The wave pass through the double slits and split into two smaller waves. As the two waves continue to travel, they simultaneously reinforce and cancel out each other at certain angles. What you see on the wide screen are several vertical columns each being a small distance apart from the other. The columns show the part where the waves reinforce each other while the spaces show where they cancel each other out. So the question is why does the electron behave like a wave when it passes through double slits? The theory is that the electron splits into two when it reaches the first screen and travels through both slits simultaneously. It then interferes with itself thereby causing a wave effect on the wide screen. In quantum physics, this is called the principle of nonlocality where something exist in two places at one time . It is not restricted to one location in time and space but it becomes omnipresent. So to find out if that was the case, a small device was placed in front of the double slits screen so that we could observe what happens when the electron passes through it. The result we got was strange beyond normal explanation. This time what we saw on the wide screen were two vertical columns instead of the several ones we saw at first. What this means is that when we are looking, it behaves like a particle. When we are not looking, it behaves as a wave . A wave is a vibration or energy. The truth is, everything in the universe is ultimately Energy, and Energy is influenced by Mind . Something only appears as matter when it is being observed."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8 Quantum physicists talk about electrons, or events being potential, rather than actual physical entities. So that there are various potentials, basically until somebody looks , and then it sort of forces the universe to make a determination about which potential is going to be actualized. All of existence is fundamentally an unlimited quantum field of energy, a sea of infinite possibilities waiting to happen. Consciousness collapses the wave function into actual particles that exist in space and time . Consciousness experiences energy as matter. Consciousness is the energy that influences energy . All energy is actually consciousness, therefore it is consciousness influencing itself. The observer is not apart from the observation. The experimenter is not apart from the experiment. The observer simultaneously plays a part in creating the reality he is observing. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle of consciousness states that no pure measurement is possible without creation. Physicists who deal in quantum mechanics state: “You cannot (objectively) observe something without changing it in the process.” This experiment also shows that God remains unmanifest unless you participate. Without God, we cannot. Without us, God would not. We are all co-creators of reality with God. God moves only when there is intention or prayer. Faith is focus. Everything is energy and energy is mental. The mind creates and controls reality. Our thoughts have the very power to shape our reality. This is how the Law of Attraction works. What we focus on most of the time, we get. The observer creates reality simply by observing .

Have you ever wondered whether your beliefs reflect reality or create it? The answer to the question is realized in understanding the concept of objective and subjective reality and the difference between the two . Most people believe that objective reality is made up by the physical laws that govern the universe. Law of gravity, thermodynamics, electromagnetism are some of those laws. But the truth is that even the physical laws themselves are governed by the higher laws of reality. Quantum physics states that everything in the most minute level is actually pure energy that is conscious, intelligent and living. This energy is directed and governed by consciousness itself. Therefore the physical laws of the universe are actually governed by the mental laws of consciousness. The physical is ruled by the spiritual. Now although we know that mind rules over matter, that does not suffice to say that we can go ahead and attempt to defy the law of gravity by jumping off a cliff just for the fun of it, without a real and strongly justifiable purpose of doing so. This is where some people misunderstand the truth and why they go and do stupid things which land them in undesirable consequences. The physical laws of the universe are not governed by the mind of a single individual alone but by the universal mind. The universal mind is the infinite intelligent consciousness of God which is connected to the minds of every single living thing in the universe. It is the universal mind that determines whether a physical law of reality is subjugated by the mind of an individual or not. In the event where a person manages to defy a physical law of reality, it is because he/she is in harmony with the will and purpose of the universal mind. That is the reason why miracles happen in this world where people are saved from certain death or experience divine providence and empowerment. So objective reality is the spiritual laws of the universe . That which is immutable, unchanging and constant. It exists whether you believe in it or not, that’s why it is objective reality. It is not subjected to your individual mind alone but by the universal mind that is greater and above all. Spirituality is defined as “belief in those aspects of reality that are not of this world or this material universe”. All reality is truly spiritual in essence . Truth is opinion that conforms to reality. Reality is that which is so whether anyone knows it or not and whether anyone likes it or not. Thus, truth is based in reality, but reality is independent of opinion . The modern notion expressed as “my truth, your truth” I automatically translate as “my opinion, your opinion,” and the assertion that we each create our own reality is an example of what I refer to as “fantasy”. Beliefs that reflect reality are beliefs in objective reality. They do not lead to its creation or uncreation. As for Subjective reality, it is the aspect of reality that you have immediate and direct control over because it is made up by your thoughts and interpretations of your experiences. It is the inner world of your mind. Subjective reality can be influenced, transformed and shaped by you. That is why it is subjective reality, it is changeable according to your beliefs. We know that the world within governs the world without. Your thoughts literally control reality. We can have control over the whole of reality by following the spiritual laws of consciousness. Hence we can govern all subjective reality by using the power of true objective reality . Subjective reality is subject to change since it is temporal. You can choose to believe differently about what you are observing and cause reality to change instantaneously or over time ."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10 Beliefs that create reality are beliefs in subjective reality. They have the power to create, perpetuate or change reality. There are things you do not have to believe in order for them to exist. They already exist in the universe anyway. Believing causes them to manifest in your experience according to the Law of Attraction. Disbelieving keeps them away from appearing in your individual reality. They may exist to others who believe but not to you. Everything you experience is the result of your thoughts whether present or some time in the past. You can explain everything that has already happened to you through this paradigm. Was there something already within your consciousness that made this words appear in your reality as the manifestation of your own thoughts? The purpose of having this understanding about beliefs and reality, is to enable you to choose authentic beliefs that serve to empower you and create the reality you desire. Understanding brings you power . You now have greater a understanding of belief so you have greater power than others in using it."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11 Difference between Thoughts and Beliefs One of the most important things to know about the mind and reality is the difference between thoughts and beliefs . The difference between a thought and a belief is that you may have thousands of thoughts going through your mind but none of them have any power except those that are beliefs . A belief is a thought that you make real, or accept as true . Choosing to make a thought real or not is a decision under the very power of the will. It is important to understand that is not our thinking that creates our circumstances, but the emotion that is attached to our thoughts . Thoughts become things but not all thoughts become things, only the thoughts that are accompanied with strong feelings and emotion. Thought is first a conscious suggestion, then it becomes a subconscious memory, working day and night . This is what operates the law of attraction, because the laws of attraction and repulsion are entirely subconscious. Thoughts may be conscious to start with, but they are subconscious as soon as they are set in motion. Now suppose I did not say I was poor, but came into the world with an unconscious thought of poverty. So long as that thought operated, I would be poor. I might not have understood the Law, but it would have been working all the time. The subconscious mind is the seat of emotion and the storehouse of memory, therefore memory is tied to emotion. Emotion is energy in motion. The more emotion a thought has, the more it is able to move things . Weak thoughts have little emotion. Strong thoughts have much emotion. The things we create in our life tend to come from our subconscious beliefs rather than our conscious thinking . If we believe everything we think about is going to manifest in one form or another, we’ll probably walk around terrified because most of us aren’t thinking positive thoughts all the time. If we have the idea that whenever we think a thought, it will create our reality, then we will be afraid to even think of anything at all. Emotion is energy in motion, therefore all activity is emotional. The subconscious mind as the seat of emotion is the operational aspect of the mind. All activity is carried out by the subconscious mind which is the creative faculty . The conscious mind only directs and instructs, therefore the subconscious mind always works in harmony with the conscious mind. The coming together of conscious and subconscious mind in order to create reality always involves the element of will and emotion . A conscious thought only has effect as long as it is being consciously thought of. But when the thought is intensified with emotion until it generates enough momentum to continue flowing on its own and become perpetual. The thought becomes a memory and subconscious programming that runs the whole mind. Every true belief is not just conscious but subconscious and is tied to emotion. A belief is an emotionalized thought . It is a fact that almost no one can maintain a conscious focus on anything for more than a few seconds. When you focus as fully as you possibly can on maintaining an image or thought in your mind, notice how long it takes before something else pops into your mind. If you’re at least modestly observant and honest with yourself, it will almost certainly last only for a few seconds. The interruption comes from your subconscious mind because it is always in motion. Thus, it’s necessary to ensure that your subconscious mind maintains the focus on your target since your conscious mind simply can’t do it . When you emotionalize the thought instead, the parts of the brain that excel at maintaining a focus which are the frontal lobes, are energized in a way that maintains the necessary subconscious focus. The result is that, subconsciously, you “keep your eyes on the ball,” on your target all of the time, even when you’re sleeping. No negative thought can ever manifest except you emotionalize the thought and accept it mentally ."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12 Refuse to entertain the suggestion of fear. Therefore no harm can come to you. The way to overcome fear is to mentally move to the opposite. When fear arises, there immediately comes with it a desire for something opposite to the thing feared. Place your attention immediately desired. Get absorbed and engrossed in your desire, knowing that the subjective always overturns the objective. Whatever you fear has its solution in the form of your desire. Love is desire. Focusing on your desire is the love that cast out fear. The feeling of health produces health, the feeling of wealth produces wealth. Your know your vibration by your feeling. Feeling is conscious perception of emotion . An emotion can run without your conscious realization until you become aware of it . Thinking and emotion are symbiotic. If you think thoughts of health or wealth but do not really feel health or wealth, it means you are thinking but not really thinking. You may be thinking the same words but you’re not thinking with the right frequency. Faith is positive expectation. Faith is not knowing how you are you going to get there but you just know that you are going there! You expect to get there. It is a knowing feeling that is strong. Fear is negative expectation. The thing you fear does not exist except as a thought in your mind. Thoughts are creative. Expect the good, mentally concentrate on the good, and know that your subconscious mind answers you always. It never fails. Faith is an action. Your mental and physical actions produce vibration and feeling. When you act as if your desire were a reality, you are acting in faith. Your actions of faith will produce the subconscious feeling and vibration of your desire being a reality . Your subconscious mind is the intelligence of your body. When your bodily actions are of faith, the vibration and emotion of your subconscious mind will also be of faith. Your imagination is your mental image in action. Your mental image is your faith. It is the evidence of things not seen and the substance of things hope for. Your mental image in action will translate into physical action of your desire coming to pass in the material world. Faith is also a feeling. Your feeling of having received what you desire is the vibration that attracts it into manifesting. Your subconscious mind is your heart, the seat of emotion. Your heart’s desire is your prayer. Prayer is intention. Prayer is making known to God what you want. To block your prayer is to hinder your intention with limiting beliefs. To open your prayer is to release your intention with liberating beliefs. God hears your prayer according to whether your belief blocks or opens your prayer to him. You have conflicting beliefs about something when your have conflicting emotions about it . You receive your heart’s desire or what you pray for with your faith. Focus on your heart’s desire and then see or feel it happen in your mind. Let your physical actions be as though your desire is a reality. Delight yourself in the Lord by feeling the joy of being loved and blessed with his goodness. Detach from the result by committing your way unto him and trusting in him. This is how your desires come to pass. God answers your prayer according to you faith. Your subconscious mind can only accept and work on affirmations that you find believable . That is why affirming that you have something when you are not yet really able to believe it will not work. The whole idea is to create the feeling of experiencing what you want . Therefore choose to use affirmations in the forms that can create those feelings in you. Refrain from using certain affirmations that you cannot really believe in until your understanding of metaphysical workings have progressed to a stage where you have the capacity to believe them. Faith comes with understanding. Faith comes from hearing and hearing the word of God. Hear and understand. The key is to understand otherwise hearing is in vain. The understanding can be conscious or subconscious. The reason why people can be healed even with their lack of faith or disbelief is because they are put into a state where their conscious mind is bypassed and their disbelief is suspended"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"13 momentarily so that the suggestions can fall into their subconscious mind and carry out its work. Subliminal messaging and affirmations have to be designed in such a way that the subconscious can process easily . The word of God as the seed sown flourishes when it falls on good ground. The ground is your heart, the subconscious mind. When your subconscious mind understands the message it receives, it takes root and becomes set in motion. The thought becomes emotionalized, internalized and turns into a belief ."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14 Mental Gender - Harmony of Conscious and Subconscious The subconscious mind is the seat of emotion and the storehouse of memory . Your subconscious mind is also known as the subjective mind because it is in subjection to the conscious mind. The conscious mind is the seat of the will and the faculty of awareness . Your subconscious mind submits to the impressions and decisions of your conscious mind without arguing or choosing but with total compliance. The relationship between the conscious and subconscious mind follows the principle of mental gender . Understanding the relationship between the conscious and subconscious mind is the whole secret to understanding the relationship between male and female . The reverse is also true. The conscious mind is the male, the leader and the subconscious mind is the female, the follower. The subconscious mind is a helper of the conscious mind. The more the workings of the conscious and subconscious minds are integrated, sync and in harmony, the more perfect the entire mind functions as a whole. The more creative and productive it becomes. The less harmony there is between the two, the more destructive it becomes and the more it collapses and cease to function properly. It is not really your conscious thoughts that create your reality, but it is your subconscious beliefs . It is the subconscious mind, the feminine aspect of mind that is the creative faculty. Have you seen a man give birth? No. It’s only the woman that bears children. The conscious mind, the masculine aspect of mind conditions a thought into the subconscious mind in order to create a belief that manifests into reality. Like a seed that is impregnated into the womb, it is nurtured within and born as a child. If you consciously assume something as true even though it may be false, your subconscious mind will accept it as true and proceed to bring about conditions as though it were true. The subconscious mind perceives by intuition. It performs its highest functions when your objective mind is suspended in a sleepy or drowsy state. Just like how woman came into life when man was asleep. The conscious mind is the watchman at the gate. It’s chief function is to protect your subconscious mind from false impressions . A suggestion cannot impose something on the subconscious mind against the will of the conscious mind. It was Adam’s responsibility to protect Eve from the suggestions of the serpent but he didn’t. He failed to use his will therefore the will of man has been faulty ever since the fall. For the conscious will to function at its best, it has to be in subjection to the superconscious will of the universal mind. The heart (subconscious mind) of man has also become faulty and it can only function best by being connected with the heart of God. You do not have to worry about subliminal messages bypassing the conscious mind and imposing itself on the subconscious mind. The subconscious mind will bring the suggestion back to consciousness in one form or another . The conscious mind can then allow it to continue its effect or to reject it, thereby making it void or reducing its power drastically. We know that repetitive subliminal suggestions can still have a certain amount of power over the mind, but once the subconscious mind has received instruction from the conscious mind to reject that suggestion, it will communicate to you in the form of feelings that there is something uneasy or discomforting about the place you are in where the suggestions are coming from. Therefore it will cause you to want to leave the area and go somewhere else. This is how intuition works. The temptation of evil always seek to come through subtle means. The serpent who was more subtle than any beast created by God tried to bypass the conscious mind (Adam) by suggesting straight to the subconscious mind (Eve). But when the subconscious mind communicated the message to the conscious mind, the conscious mind did not do it’s job to reject the suggestion. Therefore the whole mind sinned (was corrupted) and was expelled from a place of perfect happiness or bliss (Eden). The mind of humanity is in a fallen state. Only by operating with the universal mind (Christ) can it access the perfect state of mind."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"15 The female seeks to submit to a dominant male and will always seek to test his dominance and leadership. If your will is weak, your subconscious mind will submit to the conscious will of another mind . If you are not strong enough as a man for your woman, she will leave you for a stronger man. But if she loves you and is faithful to you, she will help you to be a better man. Behind every successful man is a good woman. A man does not have to try to love a woman whom he finds lovely. He can’t help loving her. A woman does not have to try to submit to a real man. She can’t help submitting to him. She wants to surrender to him and yearns to give herself to him. The key is for the man to be a real man, and for the woman to be lovely . Conscious and subconscious mind are different in roles but equal in importance and status. Man is the head but woman is the body and the heart. The head has to direct the body properly or it will get lost. Woman is normally lost without a man in her life. She is a damsel in distress longing for her prince charming to save her and show her the way. The body has to follow what the head tells it to do or they will both not accomplish anything together. Man is usually driven by his emotions for a woman. The most powerful motivating force is not the conscious but the unconscious . The conscious and subconscious mind have to work together in harmony in order to accomplish anything. When two shall agree, it shall be done for them. It is the nature of the feminine to be led and the nature of the masculine to lead . The feminine hates making decisions or accepting responsibility. The decision making power and responsibility lies with the masculine . When the masculine does not do what a man’s got to do, all hell breaks loose. In places where success is present, it is because the men are acting like men. A man has got to be decisive and make decisions. But why make decisions when you can follow intuition? When you make decisions that fail, it feels like a waste of time and effort. Your decisions are right on the dot when your intuition is spot on. The key to making decisions is to develop intuition . The head of every woman is man, but the head of every man is Christ. Man has got to lead the woman but Christ has got to lead the man. You have to use your conscious mind to direct your subconscious, but you have to let the superconscious mind direct your conscious mind . Your conscious mind is connected to your superconscious mind through your subconscious mind through intuition. That is why male and female were created for each other . Since intuition is direct communication with the spiritual, both God and Devil can use the woman to influence the man. The man needs to know whether it is God or Devil using the woman to influence him by his understanding of the truth and his intentional use of intelligence. It is man that is created with the reasoning power and intellect. Therefore a woman should follow a man who not only is strong in such areas, but also one who uses his will . The unconscious self is the grand director of all our functions. The subconscious mind is the intelligence of the body, both the physical and the energy/emotional bodies. The subconscious mind is the power that heals the body. The healing power of the subconscious mind can be activated or impaired according to the thoughts of the conscious mind. When the conscious mind pictures health, the subconscious mind produces health. When the conscious mind pictures weakness, the subconscious mind produces weakness. A man has to love his woman by taking care of her. A man has to love his own soul (emotional body) and physical body by taking care of it. He does so by taking charge of what goes into it, because what goes in is what comes out. The soul obeys the will of the spirit . The conscious mind impregnates the subconscious mind with its ideas and the subconscious mind carries it out into manifestation. The subconscious mind is the heart that bears fruit and the land that produces the harvest of the seed sown by the conscious mind. He that gets wisdom loves his own soul . Guard your heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"16 Conscious and subconscious mind are not two separate minds but they are different aspects of one mind . The role of the man is to love, lead and protect. The role of the woman is to trust, respect and follow. You can tell how much a woman has of her man by how much love she has from him. You can tell how much a man has of his woman by how much compliance his has from her. This is how you can access their relationship . What one gender does for the other, it does for itself. What the conscious and subconscious mind does for the other, it is the mind doing it for itself. Male and female exist in every person. The more developed a person’s masculine and feminine qualities are, the more complete, integrated and whole he/she is. Each person should love, protect, respect, trust, lead and follow himself/herself. You are the will and the emotion, the brain and the heart, the head and the body. The more balanced a person’s male and female side is, the more attractive that person is. A woman who is very lovely but she can assert herself. A man who is strong but he can feel and has feelings. Such are the people who represent the perfect type of mate that everyone desires . There is also such a thing as role reversal between the conscious and subconscious mind . The conscious mind has to trust and follow while the subconscious mind directs and protects. Follow your heart and allow it to direct you. Your intuition can lead you through feelings. Trust your subconscious mind and allow it to protect you. The conscious and subconscious mind operate as equals . One is not above the other. They function side by side. The will is directed by desire. You can’t fight against desire with the will. You have to use desire to override desire. Desire is a feeling. In this area, the conscious mind is directed by the subconscious mind. Since thinking and emotion are symbiotic, you have to use your conscious mind to think thoughts that will produce a different set of feelings to conflict and neutralize the first. But a person’s truest feelings can never be truly overridden because they are his/her essence. You can override a faulty desire by allowing the desire of the universal mind to impress upon your subconscious mind. Give your heart to God and he will give you a new heart ."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"17 Seven Senses - All sense is One sense There is only one sense, the sense of feeling . All other senses are different forms of the same sense . To see, hear, touch, smell or taste is to feel. All senses lead to feeling . Looking is touching. The more you like something or someone, the more you look at it and the more you are mentally touching it. Different colors have different psychological, biological and spiritual effects on us. Music moves people in ways that nothing else can. Different sound, beats, rhythm and harmony lead to different emotional journeys. Music can transport us to places we’ve never been to before and the sound of a sweet and gentle voice can melt your heart completely. The statement “You reached out for my hand but end up touching my heart” shows that touching someone usually has more than a physical effect. By the nature of your touch, they can sense your strength, attitude, intention and emotion. The way to a man’s heart or emotions is through his stomach. The food that we eat required more than nutritional value to satisfy us. We consume not just for our physical well being but also for our emotional well being. Some people tend to eat more when they feel anxiety. They psychologically feel that they are lacking something and therefore they need to fill up. Smell is the attractant or repellent scent of love. The smell of others literally pull you towards or push you away from them. The scent of beautiful smelling flowers can create instant feelings of romance and serenity. It is said that it isn’t most important how great a guy looks or what he says, but how he makes her feel. Everything that he does is to make her feel attracted to him. The same is also true for the guy being attracted to the girl. As it is in the world of attraction, so is it in the entire universe. All sensory stimulus are basically vibrations . Light waves, sound waves, tactile and chemical vibrations. The universe is one whole seamless sea of vibrations. Your five sense interprets the different levels of vibration into sight, hearing, touching, smelling and tasting. The most primitive sense of perceiving vibrations is the sense of feeling . Vibrations have to be felt . That is why the invisible and the silent forces can only be perceived by feeling them. Vibrations that are beyond the range of the five senses ability to detect can be perceived directly by our consciousness. All sensory input travels through our nervous system and gets processed by our brain and passed on to our consciousness, the higher energy aspect of our being. Our consciousness can perceive beyond the limits of our physical bodies that it is in phase with while we’re alive. Thought vibrations are finer than any other vibrations in the physical world . Consciousness is most sensitive to thought vibrations. There is a Universal Consciousness that permeates and connects everything in the universe. Therefore, our thoughts can literally affect the things around us."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"18 Plants do not have eyes to see nor ears to hear but they respond to sunlight and music. When placed under a shade, they will grow towards where the light is shining through. When placed beside a stereo, they will bend towards it when the music is harmonious and away from it if the music is discordant. Plants even respond to the thoughts of people. In the book Primary Perception, a plant registers bioelectrical activity when the author intended to burn it. It even displayed a response at a distance when he forgot to bring his wallet outside and decides to return home. When he replicated his steps, there was no response. The plant is able to differentiate between planned and spontaneous activity. This shows that plants and other living cell organisms can literally read our thoughts. Talking with trees is not that far fetched an idea after all. The truth that all sense is one sense explains why when people lose one of their senses, they are able to make up for it with the rest . The other senses can take over the function of the lost sense so well that they can still go on living their lives normally. Sometimes it happens so well that a loss of one of their senses seem to be more advantageous to them than when they had it. Their compensating senses develop beyond the normal level of power that enables them to do amazing things. Since all five senses lead to feeling, the reverse is also true. Feeling will also lead to all five senses . A blind person can see your face by feeling it. He can even see you better with his hands and his heart than you can see him with your eyes. His sense of feeling can see past appearance into a person’s true nature. Knowing that all sensory stimulus are vibrations helps you to understand how cross sensory perception works . You can hear the loudness of color and see the brightness of sound. People can have good or bad tastes in art and music. You can taste what you smell and smell what you see. Dolphins see the ocean scape with sonar while bats see in darkness with echo. You can see the shape of a baby in a womb with ultrasound. In fact, you could even think that all sense is seeing sense, all sense is hearing sense, all sense is touching sense, all sense is smelling sense, all sense is tasting sense and all sense is feeling sense . Since all sense is one sense , you can interpret one form of sensory data into another . Everything is light, everything is sound, everything is touch, everything is smell, everything is taste and everything is feeling. Seeing is feeling, hearing is feeling, touching is feeling, smelling is feeling, tasting is feeling. There is an order of development of the five senses in the womb . The first to develop is sense of touch followed by sense of taste, sense of smell, sense of hearing and sense of sight. In the external world, the order of senses in terms of perceptual reach from closest to furthest range is touch, taste, smell, hearing and sight. The sense of touch is the closest to the sense of feeling because it is an external form of feeling. The sixth sense is a sense of inner knowing and inner feeling. To know is to feel, to feel is to know . Knowing and feeling are one. How do you know something? You know it as an internal feeling. How do you know something to be true? You know it by how it feels. We can look at a dog and know what it is without thinking the word “dog” in our head. If we look at a dog and we look at a spoon, we know through internal feelings or sensations, they are different things . They do not just look different but they also feel different. We internally register a different feeling from perceiving each one . Our sixth sense delivers that data to us. It is the sensory that is closest to what we are looking for, a frequency or energy."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"19 You experience frequency, energy or vibration by feeling . There is an internal frequency or feeling for every mental phenomena you experience. All mental states are internal frequencies or feelings . It you can recreate the internal frequency, you can recreate the phenomena. There is a frequency of inspiration, passion, confidence, creativity etc. Emotion or feeling is the closest thing to frequency or vibration that we can communicate to the universe with. Feeling or frequency is how we communicate with things . This is how psychokinesis works. We put our mind in the mental state or frequency that is in synch with the object in order to move it. If you wanted to float an apple across the room, do you just tell the apple “Hey apple! I command you to float across the room!”? No. It is an internal frequency or feeling we think that moves it . Understanding our sixth sense opens up our paranormal abilities . If you can perceive, you can also exert . Energy can move in two directions, in and out. They say you can’t see God but you can feel him, He is like the wind. It begins with feeling, and then hearing, and then seeing. When you begin to feel his presence, you can hear his still small voice and then you shall see visions that he reveals to you. Usually all that takes place mentally in the realm of your imagination although it sometimes happen physically for some people too. The realm of the imagination is spiritual, therefore what takes place in it isn’t just make belief but it is also very real. Since it is the nature of the universe to exist in sevens, there is a seventh sense. The seventh sense is thought perception . Every place has a mental atmosphere which is made up of the collective thought waves of people that had passed through there. When you go into a place where people have been involved in the mental activity of reading, your thought waves will be entrained for reading. The same is true for mental atmospheres of dancing, relaxing, racing, worshiping or any activity. Feeling is thought . To feel is to think . Feeling is a form of thinking . The sixth sense is to think by feeling. The sixth sense is the link between the first five and the seventh . Emotion and thinking are symbiotic , one never exists without the other. Whenever one seems to exist without the other, it means the other is subconscious . You thinking affects your emotion and your emotion affects your thinking. Everything is energy and it is Mind that moves energy. Emotion is energy in motion and since Mind is energy, emotion is mind moving itself . Intuition is combined operation of the sixth and seventh senses . When you come into the presence of people, you can sense their energies and their thought waves . You can perceive whether they are weak or strong, dull or brilliant, good or evil, positive or negative. The same is true for the energies you project for others to sense as well. Just like you can transmute the sense of hearing into the sense of seeing by making a three dimensional mental picture from the sounds of your environment, you can also transmute the sixth sense into the seventh sense by understanding what your feelings mean . Your intuition is most powerful when you are able to feel and understand what your feelings mean . You have to use your seventh sense to help your sixth sense. As the sensory inputs of light, sound, touch, smell and taste are reproduced in your brain, so are the thought waves of your environment reproduced in your brain as well. When you are with wise people, you will tend to think wise thoughts. When you are with foolish people, you will tend to think foolish thoughts. The same is true in the presence of good or evil, strong or weak, positive or negative people."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20 Just like you can block out light by not looking and overpower one sound with a louder one, you can shut out negative thoughts by not thinking them or overpower them with positive ones. To sense is to perceive. Perception is thought. All senses are thought . Everything is Thought. Thought is Mind in Motion. Thought is vibration and vibration is Energy. To sense is to experience Energy in motion or E-motion . When you touch something, your body feels energy behaving in a certain way and your mind interprets it as hard, soft, cold, warm, smooth, rough, etc. Externally experienced things are external E-motions. Internally experienced things are internal Emotions. Feeling is perception of emotion . An emotion can run without your conscious realization until you feel and become aware of it . Everything is Emotion. All emotion is energy in motion. Feelings are everything."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"21 Seven States of Matter - Everything is Mind There are a total of seven states of matter in the universe. The usual three states of matter that we are familiar with are solid, liquid and gas . All states of matter differ in terms of properties such as integrity of shape and vibrational rate of molecules. There are four more states of matter. The fourth state of matter above gas is plasma . Plasma is ionized gas. It is gas that is superheated to the point some of its electrons break away from their nuclei and join other nuclei. The gas molecules are in an unstable state and therefore behave in a haphazard and unpredictable manner. Stars are made of plasma Fire is plasma. It is powerful, dangerous and attractive at the same time. The fifth state of matter above plasma is beam . The difference between beam and the other four states is that the particles of solid, liquid, gas and plasma all move randomly in all directions whereas the particles of beam move harmoniously in one direction. Beam is harmonious and coherent whereas plasma is chaotic and erratic. The vast difference of temperament between the forth and fifth state of matter very well corresponds to the idea that there is greatest amount of chaos right before order, or there is greatest amount of confusion right before clarity appears. There is great war before there is great peace. Beam also differs from the other four states in terms of being non-thermal while the rest are thermal. The more energetic the vibrations of particles are, the more heat they would generate. But because the particles of beam are traveling in the same direction, they do not collide against each other to generate heat. Friction is the cause of heat. Friction is the result of particles colliding with each other and increasing their vibration or kinetic energy. Beam creates heat not in itself but when its particles clash against other matter. You feel the heat of light when its photons clash against the molecules of your skin. The greater the intensity of the beam and the more concentrated it is, the more friction it will generate when it interacts with other matter. You get incinerated when you get close enough to the sun. Heat is vibration generated by friction of one state of matter with another or with itself . Sound is vibration propagating through matter . Other than these five states of matter, there is a state lower than all these states. It is the zero state of matter. The zero state of matter is known as the BEC or Bose-Einstein Condensate . It is the most condensed condensate of all matter. This state of matter was discovered by the scientist called Bose. He shared his findings with Einstein who helped him to publish his work to the world. Their joint venture resulted in the newly discovered state of matter being known as the Bose-Einstein Condensate. A BEC exists when matter is frozen to extremely low temperatures that are a tiny fraction of a degree above absolute zero. In this state, the atoms overlap into each other to form a wave. The BEC is a matter wave . If the wave was compressed, it would form a singularity. If enough mass was condensed into the singularity it could turn into a black hole. It is believed that the zero state of matter could lead to the development of flat space technology. In future, it might be possible to transport huge objects in very tiny spaces as long as they are not compressed beyond the critical mass which would result in a black hole."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"22 The occurrence of a black hole while making BEC would not need to be too much of a concern anyway because it would require a tremendous amount of energy to compress mass into the critical point. The zero state of matter, like the fifth state of matter, is also non-thermal. It does not emit heat as well since its particles are not in motion at all thereby not causing friction. Some elements of each state of matter are able to exist at room temperature. There are room temperature plasmas and matter waves (dark matter). So these are the six states of matter. But all things exist in sevens, since it is the nature of the universe to exist in sevens . The fifth state of matter is not the limit, there is a sixth state above it. Thought wave is the sixth state of matter . Thought wave exists at a higher energetic level than beam. Thought wave can move even faster than beam. It moves at the speed of infinity. It is at once here and at once there. Thought wave is local and nonlocal. The truth is, all matter is basically one and the same. All matter is different manifestation of thought wave or etheric matter . All other states are condensations of the highest state. Thought is consciousness, consciousness is mind. The Universal Mind is what all things ultimately consist of. Every single elemental type of matter has its own default state at room temperature. That is because it has a mind, consciousness or memory to exist in that state and have its corresponding properties. It is a mental programming present within the matter that arranges the atoms, molecules or subatomic particles in a particular manner. There is Intelligence in Everything. All Stuff is Thinking Stuff. As the Universal Mind thinks of a form, it takes the form. As it thinks of a motion, it makes the motion. Everything you see in the universe is an expression of a thought of the Universal Mind . That is the way all things were created. We live in a mental universe and all things are truly thought forms. When science is able to develop ways of manipulating the mental programming within matter, we will be able to create “smart objects” such as paper that can uncrease itself perfectly after being crushed into a ball. Or even a “mercury man” terminator machine who can transform itself into any shape and color. We are able to change the form and properties of an object by changing the way it thinks. This sums up the seven states of matter, from matter wave to thought wave. All matter is one matter. All matter is thought wave . All matter is energy. All energy is one energy. All energy is kinetic energy . Everything moves, everything vibrates. All energy is consciousness . Thought is mind in motion . All matter is mind . All matter and energy are different manifestations of Mind. Mind is Matter. Matter is Mind. Mind is the universal matter. Everything needs a medium to exist in. The law of the universe is something must exist in something else . Something cannot exist in nothing. A total vacuum is space empty of everything else except the Ether (dark energy) or thought wave. There is no such thing as complete empty space. It would not even be space at all. All matter has mass and occupies space. Mass is the measure of an object’s resistance to changes in either the speed or direction of its motion. The Ether or thought wave is what fills up the space in a vacuum. It has the least amount of mass because it is of the lowest density. There are different densities of thought wave and different densities in Ether . The Universal Mind is the Ether or Thought Wave by which all other thought waves (etheric matter/energy) pass through ."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"23 Something cannot be created from nothing . In the beginning, there was nothing but God or the universal mind. God can only create from himself. God is the universal matter. All things are manifestations of the universal mind/matter. The universe is one continuous sea of energy. There is no separation except by perception. The universe was created as an idea in the Mind of God. First there was thought wave. The thought wave became beam, the beam became plasma, the plasma became gas, the gas became liquid, the liquid became solid and the solid became black holes. There is balance of forces in the universe . The universal thought wave is even finer than our individual thought waves. The universal mind is the Ether that permeates all things and is All Things . Everything is Mind. Mind is Everything. The Universe Is Mind."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"24 True Theory of Everything in the Universe The Theory of Everything which all scientists of the world are looking for has already been existing in ancient times. It is found in what is known as Divine Science. It exist as the Seven Hermetic Principles of Hermes Trismegistus (Trice Greatest). The seven principles explain the nature of all reality in the most perfect, complete and concise statements. The Seven Hermetic Principles and the Hermetic Philosophy are now contained in the Kybalion written by Three Initiates. The Kybalion is the master key that unlocks all the doors of the Temple of Knowledge. It is the Light of Understanding that illuminates all the pathways of knowledge . It is the highest Source Knowledge above all other source knowledge. It is the ultimate core of all cores. It contains The Principles of all principles. THE SEVEN HERMETIC PRINCIPLES The principles of truth are seven; the seven hermetic principles, upon which the entire Hermetic philosophy is based, are as follows: 1. The Principle of mentalism: “The All is mind, the Universe is mental.” 2. The Principle of correspondence: “As above, so below; as below, so above.” 3. The principle of vibration: “Nothing rests, everything moves; everything vibrates.” 4. The principal of polarity: “Everything is dual; everything has poles; everything has its pair of opposites; like and unlike are all the same; opposites are identical in nature, but different in degree; extremes meet; all truths are but half-truths; all paradoxes may be reconciled.” 5. The principle of rhythm: “Everything flows, out and in; everything has its tides; all things rise and fall; the pendulum swing manifests in everything; the measure of the swing to the right is the measure of the swing to the left; rhythm compensates.” 6. The principle of cause and effect: “Every cause has its effect; every effect has its cause; everything happens according to law; chance is but a name for law not recognized; there are many planes of causation, but nothing escapes the law.” 7. The principal of Gender: “Gender is in everything; everything has its masculine and feminine principle; Gender manifests on all planes.” There is no portion of the occult teachings possessed by the world which have been so closely guarded as the fragments of the Hermetic Teachings which have come down to us over the tens of centuries which have elapsed since the lifetime of its great founder, Hermes Trismegistus. The term occult simply means hidden or concealed . The reason why it is hidden or not easily revealed is because it is the most powerful kind of knowledge in the universe. The lips of wisdom are closed except to the ears of understanding. A prudent man conceals knowledge. It is revealed only to those who are ready for such power. The principles of the occult are usually hidden from view in plain sight. They are there for everyone to notice and realize in the workings of nature, life and the universe ."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"25 But most people having eyes yet unseeing and having ears yet unhearing. They perceive not, neither do they understand because they do not have clarity of discernment. Secret Knowledge is the most powerful kind of knowledge . It is about knowing how things work and understanding what’s going on. Knowledge is power . In order to rob the Children of Light of power, the Devil takes the most powerful knowledge of the universe and associates himself with it. He causes the Church to shun such knowledge as Satanic so that people will abstain from it. In doing so, he keeps the world in as much ignorance and powerlessness as possible. The Bible says that the Angel of Light Lucifer was full of wisdom and perfect in beauty . But because of his belief that he can be God, he wanted to exalt his throne above the stars of God, upon the mount of the congregation, to the sides of the north and to become like the Most High. (Ezekiel 28:11-19) Therefore Jesus cast him out of heaven and he and a third of heaven’s angels who joined him made their dwelling place on the Earth. Lucifer wants to make himself known as the God of the Universe, even higher than the God of Christianity. Because he was full of wisdom and perfect in beauty, he had complete knowledge of the workings of the entire universe and was the most powerful heavenly being. The name Lucifer means Bringing Light . Lucifer uses universal knowledge in any of his work so as to present an abundance of truth and light to people. Universal knowledge is received by people from God through direct inspiration . But Lucifer’s great deception is organizing it in the most subtle and ingenious ways to lure mankind away from the true God of Christianity. The Devil’s only real weapon is the weapon of Deceit . By deceiving good as evil and evil as good, he weakens his enemies minds towards opposing him. You are never too far away from error. It’s only a few degrees away from the truth. You are never too far away from the truth either. It is only a few degrees back . Rat poison is 99 percent wheat and 1 percent poison. He that has ears to hear let him hear. The occult is in every area of human science, arts, religion, philosophy and business. There is no escape from it. Truth is mixed with error in every place. It is only stupidity to shun truth just because there is error . This is one of the main causes of ignorance. We are called to be a light in the darkness, for what good is there with light among light? Only the truly wise see through such things and know how to discern without the perceptive filters imposed by other lesser minds. The opposite is true, those that see through will become wise. The Devil loses when we know the Truth. Clarity is victory, obscurity is defeat . The Devil plays the game of mixing truth and error knowing that one out of four situations can happen. Three which are in his favor and only one in yours. Because it is the nature of the subconscious mind to make associations , he knows that the first two situations that could occur would be: 1. You would think that they are both true. 2. You would think that they are both false. To exercise discernment which is an aspect of the conscious mind, is to differentiated between what’s real and what’s not. The next two situations that could occur would be: 3. You would believe the lie as the truth and the truth as the lie. 4. You would discern what is truly true and what is truly false. The final option is the one where the Devil is outgamed. To be able to discern correctly requires true wisdom ."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"26 The time has come when Children of Light should become wise as serpents, by embracing the truths that were kept hidden away from them and use their God given powers to overcome the Forces of Darkness.

This is true only with the True Light in control (Jesus), but the reverse is true with the Other Light (Lucifer). All it takes is Awareness. You are unstoppable when you use ultimate power for righteous intention . The Bible says that Lucifer abides not in the truth because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a truth, he is merely using what belongs to Jesus. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own. For he is a liar and the father of lies . Lucifer is no longer really an Angel of Light but a Prince of Darkness . Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights , with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. Universal Knowledge is good because it is originally from God, although Lucifer has it too. The heart of the prudent gets knowledge. A man of knowledge increases power. But believing in Jesus Christ as God and your savior from your sin through his death on the cross and resurrection on the third day is the key to eternal life .

The world within is the cause, the world without is the effect. The inner governs the outer always. The outer is a reflection of the inner. The outer conditions mirror the inner consciousness. The world within and the world without are not two separate worlds. They are two different levels of the same world. The world is mental. All is mind, the universe is mental.

One gives you awareness, the other gives you power. Secret Knowledge is knowing how things work and understanding what’s going on. The reason why it is secret is because it is not normally known. It is so powerful that only those with insight and perception can appreciate its value. Only conscious people can see reality for what it really is. When you have this knowledge, you can use it first to govern yourself, then use it to govern everything else. This is called using secret knowledge as governing knowledge. Governing knowledge is knowledge that runs your psyche. It is the governing statements of your mind that determine what you do, how you do it and why you do it. It is the operating dynamics that controls your thoughts, your emotions and your behaviors. What governs you mind, governs your reality. By governing yourself, you can govern the world.

Astrology helps us to foretell the future because what happens in the world of thoughts has its corresponding expression in the arrangement of the universe. Everything follows a system of cause and effect . Therefore what happens in the present will follow a perfectly orderly path that results in what the future will be like. The truth about Astrology is that the stars do not determine our fate, they merely reflect it . The same is true for any system of Divination. Since Man’s thinking can be changed from time to time, the state of the Future is in constant flux . That is why whatever that is foretold by Astrology does not always come true. It is not because the prediction is inaccurate. It was indeed something that was going to happen at the moment the stars were read, but the thoughts of the person that create the situation had changed. Therefore the Future was changed, what was supposed to happen at first has been overridden . Thought creates Fate. Therefore when thought is changed, fate is changed . When thought is fixed, fate is fixed. The universe is the manifestation of the universal mind. The universal mind communicates with us through the universe. The universal mind knows our future by what we think in the present. It always feedback the would be results of our thoughts back to us through signs. The universal mind is our guide and counsel. By listening to its divine intelligence, we are given second chances to change course when necessary. Since the future is in constant flux, the universe is also in constant flux. When our thoughts change, the arrangement of the stars will also change. When you change your appearance, your reflection in the mirror will also change . This explains why when you take a second reading, it will differ from the first . This is why the features on your face and the lines on your palm will change when you change your mind. The reading of your fortune from these areas also changes. Your inner consciousness is reflected by the outer world of the material . This is the nature of the universe. This is the understanding that makes sense of all these things that people have been confused about. The problem with Astrology and other systems of divination is the misconceptions that people have about them. When they think that negative readings about their future are meant to happen, they begin to focus on it and expect it to happen. In so doing, they seal their own fate and fulfill their own prophesy. Those who know the Truth are above such systems because they can reshape reality and transform the future anyway they desire according to the infinite source of power that resides within them. The individual mind working in harmony with the Universal Mind has the highest Authority of power over all things . Everyone is creating the future with his or her thoughts. If you are not in control of your thoughts, it means you are controlled by others and they are creating your future for you. You must take charge of your own mind in order to live your destiny. You do not need systems of divination to tell you your future. The best way to predict the future is to create it ."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"29 Science of Vibration in Every Aspect of the Physical World The entire physical universe is made up of pure energy and vibration . When you have the insight to see everything as vibration, the nature of the universe is revealed to you. Light is vibration. The entire electromagnetic wave spectrum of visible light produces different colors. Colors are simply waves vibrating at different frequencies . On one end of the spectrum you have red, on the other end you have violet. Red has the longest wavelength and the lowest frequency, violet has the shortest wavelength and the highest frequency. There are two kinds of electrical lighting that you can find when you visit an electronic store. Warm light and cool light. Warm light contains a greater mixture of lower frequency color waves such as yellow and orange. Cool light contains a greater mixture of higher frequency color waves such as green and blue. Light is crucial in its environmental effect upon work, play, rest and other life activities. It controls stimulation, relaxation and energy level . Since warm light is more relaxing than cool light, you might decide to use it for the ambience it creates. Have you ever used only warm lights in a room and thought that you could make the place more relaxing or stimulating simply by increasing or decreasing the light intensity? But it doesn’t work that way. Increasing the light intensity of warm light does not make it a lot more stimulating. Higher energy levels require higher rate of vibration . It is not the magnitude but the frequency of the vibration that determines it’s energy level . Is it any wonder that blue flame is hotter than yellow flame? Health is vibration. Cold, damp and dark places with lack of airflow are breeding grounds for bacteria, whereas sunny places with abundance of airflow eliminate unhealthy micro organisms. The second type of environment is healthier than the first because it is high vibration while the other is low vibration. Although sunlight is biologically beneficial, too much of it causes heatstroke. The energy turns from being constructive to destructive. The key here is balance . Too much of something beyond the rightful amount causes instability. This is what all sickness and disease does. It seeks to weaken or destabilize vibration . The more vibrant and stable a person is, the more alive and constructive he/she are. The more lackluster and unstable he/she is, the less alive and/or the more (self)destructive. Ever wonder why you have always been told to drink warm water and not to drink cold one when you were sick? When the body is sick, there are things within that are clogging up the system and slowing down some functions. The body needs energy to move the sickness out of the body or to destroy it . That is why your doctor advices you to drink plenty of water. It is the medium that your blood cells use to mobilize their work. More water and oxygen gives your body the much needed resources it needs in getting rid of the sickness. Your impulse of coughing out phlegm and blowing out mucus is your bodies act of expelling the bad stuff from your body, which means you are on the road to recovery. Warm water is high vibration whereas cold water is low vibration. Cold water removes the precious energy needed for recovery, whereas warm water supplies it. One supports your recovery rate while the other sabotages it. Sound is vibration. Bassy music is low vibration and energetic music is high vibration. We enjoy listening to different types of music because we like to experience different ranges of emotion . The variety of feelings in life makes it fun and meaningful. High energy dance music appeal to younger people because they are highly energetic and expressive. Slower and emotional entrancing music is what we desire to"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"30 hear when we want to be moved in a deep and sensual way. We want time to slow down and come to a standstill the experience to be like an eternal moment. Chemical is vibration. Alcohol and earl grey tea are opposite in terms of vibration. Although stress and anxiety is a form of high vibration, it is undesirable because the vibration is incoherent and disorderly . Alcohol lowers vibration. That’s why people drink to relax and distress. But drinking consumes more than the natural amount of alcohol that the body is supposed to take. Therefore it causes instability as well. Drivers who drink have impaired judgment and reaction rate are more susceptible to accidents. People who are above the need of alcohol to relax have chosen more intelligent means of doing so. Earl grey tea acts as a stimulant that counters the effects of alcohol to a certain extent to “sober” you up. The vibration of our “bodies” at every level, physical and non-physical , has a profound influence on our ability to attract positive experiences. The higher your vibration, the more of a “magnet” you become as a result of the thoughts you hold in your mind. By holding only thoughts of the “things” you wish to manifest into your experience, and keeping your vibrations high in the ways we discussed previously, you will find your wishes will manifest much more quickly. When you learn to see everything as vibration different in terms of rate and stability, you will understand what you need in order to obtain the desired effect in any situation. It is all about balancing vibrations . There are lots more aspects of physical reality than those mentioned here where this principle is applied to. Once you are aware of this principle and always think in terms of vibration, you can understand practically everything that happens in the physical world. This is one of the governing dynamics that allows you to make sense of everything. Having this awareness is like seeing the world in code , like the Matrix."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"31 Nature of Vibration in the Spiritual Dimension In the physical world, different rates of vibration result in different kinds of effects. But vibrations that are high on the physical plane may be low on the spiritual plane. The key is knowing how vibration is defined differently on the spiritual plane compared to the physical . In the spiritual dimension, negative energy is lower vibration because it is denser and heavier. Positive energy is higher vibration because it is finer and lighter. All negative energy makes you feel trapped and heavy. All positive energy makes you feel free and light. That is the difference between joy and grief, peace and stress, clarity and frustration. Negative energy is emotional burden while positive energy is emotional freedom. Emotions are truly spiritual in nature . It is important to know that energy attracts more energy of the same kind. Positive emotions attract more positive emotions whereas negative emotions attract more negative emotions. Energy on the spiritual plane will also attract corresponding scenarios on the physical plane. Feeling positive will result in more good things happening to you as if you are charmed or magnetic towards blessings. Feeling negative will lead to more undesirable things happening as if you are cursed or can’t seem to help pulling bad things into your life. Emotion and thinking are symbiotic , one never exists without the other. Whenever one seems to exist without the other, it means the other is subconscious . Your thinking affects your emotion and your emotion affects your thinking. Your physiology also affects your emotion. But your physiology affects your emotion by affecting your subconscious mind which is the faculty of your emotion. Certain negative emotions are not negative in the truest sense when they are meant to propel you to take action that is constructive. Anger and anxiety are emotions of a state that give you energy to take action . They are in between dense and light because they are dynamic. Anger is felt when there is a need to handle something that is trying to hurt you. Anger can be converted into well being through assertiveness. Anxiety is felt when there is a need to protect something from being taken away. Anxiety can be converted into confidence by doing courage. Such emotions although not entirely negative can be considered negative when compared with higher emotions of well being and confidence that are more positive. Higher vibrations are usually better. Negative emotion can be converted into positive emotion through right thinking and acting . The only problem is when those emotions are handled immaturely resulting in a regression from anger to depression or anxiety to avoidance. Depression and avoidance are emotional states that rob you of energy . Those are the true negative emotions we should acknowledge and be with in order to know what we truly want and allow ourselves to act authentically towards it. Anything that is truly negative subtracts energy. Otherwise it can be considered positive in one way or another . Good thoughts also attract good situations in your life while bad thoughts attract bad situations. The stronger the thoughts, the stronger the emotions. When you change your thoughts, you change everything . It is by this power that the forces of life are transformed from one condition to another. Magic is the mental manipulation of quantum forces to reshape the reality matrix continuum . The most powerful force of the mind is its ability to create, control and change reality . This is the true"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"32 magic of life! The more joyful, happy and “light-hearted” you are, the higher will be your corresponding overall rate of vibration. The higher your inherent rate of vibration, the more powerful will be your attractive powers will be. Joy is a very high emotion and therefore high state of vibration and Energy along with Unconditional Love. The more joyful you are the higher will be your rate of vibration and the more aligned you will be to The Source. This in turn will enable you to manifest your desires much more freely. On the physical level, higher and lower vibrations are neither positive or negative. On the spiritual level, higher vibrations are always more positive than lower vibrations. Low spiritual vibrations are caused by imbalance of physical vibrations. Balancing physical vibrations results in high spiritual vibrations. This is the difference and correlation of the nature of vibration between the physical and spiritual level of reality. Having this higher level of awareness helps you to see beyond the matrix of physical reality ."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"33 Be a Helping Mind - Psychic Influence What people need is a helping mind rather than a helping hand . There are times when people come to you with a problem on their minds that is bothering them. They feel negative about it and are having thoughts of not being capable enough to deal with it. Maybe they lack confidence, belief, ideas or whatever they say it is. You might feel there’s nothing you can do to help them because you are not in a position to directly influence the factors of their situation. But the truth is, that is not true! If that was the case, then what is the use of your friends telling you what their problem is? Is it just to share their sorrows with you so that they will feel better? Well, that does help to a certain extent. Talking about a problem brings order to the mind so as to position it to deal with it objectively. Having a negative emotion released in the company of an understanding friend dissipates its influence so that the person will start attracting less of the problem. But, there is more that you can do than that! Contrary to conventional thinking, instead of what you can do with your hands, actions or even money for that person, the greatest help that you can give is actually mental! You would probably be thinking what that means is about giving advice and speaking words of encouragement that can change the mind of the person into being more positive. But that idea is only part of it. The most powerful form of mental help is psychic influence. You can influence the actions of another by using the power of your mind. The thoughts you think in your mind send out thought waves that can affect the minds of others . Thought waves are as real as electromagnetic and sound waves. Mind is the most responsive medium to thought waves . There are two kinds of mental influence you can use. One is visualization and the other is affirmation . When you use visualization, you imagine your friend doing what is best for him/herself. Picture in your mind that your friend is carrying out the action required to solve his/her problem. See him/her as acting with courage, being strong and filled with positive energy. Watch the amazing things that happen after you do that. Your friend will feel a strong positive urge to do those things and enjoy doing them although he/she may have resisted doing them in the past. They will even acknowledge that they know perfectly well what they are doing is very odd behavior because they never do that before. When you use affirmation, you send a mental command to the person you wish to influence. In your mind, you think of a statement as though mentally speaking it. Some affirmations can be “You are feeling a renewed sense of confidence and power”, “You have the courage to do what you need to do”, “You are unstoppable in overcoming the problem”, “You will succeed and not fail”. You can also use affirmation by sending a thought into reality. You can think of the statements “My friend (Name) is feeling positive”, “She is taking action to achieve her goal right now”, “He succeeds in getting what he wants”. These are just general statements that you can make a lot more specific for the exact situation you friend is facing."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"34 Mind controls behavior, not only yours but others as well. You can change a person’s behavior by imagining him/her behaving differently . This is what praying for another person is really all about . Ask and it shall be giving unto you always. To imagine is to ask. The superconscious always activate in reality what you think about. But since the superconscious operates according to its divine justice, if what you think about is not in harmony with its Higher Will, it will influence other minds to think opposing thoughts for it to activate against your own. The prayer of the righteous will prevail over the prayer of evil. Both are given what they ask but only one will receive because one gift will destroy the other . When evil prevail, it is because the righteous are mentally passive. Knowing this helps you to understand how prayer really works in every area of life . It is good when others influence you in a way that benefits you. When you think God is influencing your mind positively, He could actually be influencing the mind of another to influence your mind positively. God always works with you through others. The reverse is also true. It is not good when others influence you in ways that are detrimental to you. When you sense an urge to do something that isn’t really beneficial for you, whether you succumb to that influence or repel it away with an opposing force will depend on the thoughts you constantly hold in your mind. Rightful thoughts attract rightful influence and repel harmful ones. The same is true for wrongful thoughts. You thoughts can not only affect your own reality but other people’s reality as well . If a group of people think negatively about a person, it will make the reality of that person changing that much more difficult. That person will have to fight not only his own inner conflict keeping him from improving, but the exterior conflict coming from his peer group. The more people imagine a person’s success and well being, the more that person’s reality will be enhanced by the collective mental support of the group. Usually the reason why others think negatively about someone is because they are just reflecting the negative thoughts that originated from that person. The environment reflects the mind. But we as higher aspects of our environment have conscious control over the reflection process . Everything else may have no choice but to reflect the mind of a person but we can choose not to reflect by purposely thinking differently. Changing reality is our power as conscious beings. When you keep thinking about someone in a negative, disempowering and unhelpful way although it is “true”, your thoughts will perpetuate his/her reality. Start thinking differently and you will affect the situation differently. When you choose not to reflect people’s negative reality creating thoughts, but to reshape their reality with your own positive thoughts instead, it means you are stronger than them. Your reality is stronger than theirs . We are like God who helps them when they cannot help themselves. If you desire to help someone destroy some form of lack, limitation or error, the correct method is not to think of the person whom you wish to help. The intention to help them is entirely sufficient , as this puts you in mental touch with the person. Then drive out of your own mind any belief of lack, limitation, disease, danger, difficulty or whatever the trouble might be about the person’s situation. As soon as you have succeeded is doing this the result will have been accomplished, and the person will be free. Sometimes our very own beliefs or mindset of limitation, lack or any other disempowering thing about the person’s reality might be the very thing that is keeping him/her stuck in that reality. The same could be very true when others are affecting our reality the same way with their thoughts of lack and limitation in regards to the situation we are engaging. That is why it is so important to be with supportive and positive people who believe in the possibilities and abundance of our success. It is also very important to stop believing in lack and limitation of a person’s condition and choose to focus on the possibilities and freedom of being able to achieve what they want ."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"35 One of the keys to a successful marriage is to basically just think positively about your spouse. By doing this you’ll soon find your spouse living up to your positive expectations. Thinking in positive, empowering and helpful ways pays of in many ways. You will benefit, your friends will benefit, and even the world will benefit. Always increase the momentum and escalation of positive thoughts and stop the momentum of negative ones. Since thoughts are both local (present) and non-local (omnipresent), you can influence the mind of another even from a distance . That means you can influence others out of sight and out of hearing. Reality always take form according to our thoughts. Superconscious always act according to our intentions. God always moves with prayer. Without God we cannot, without us God will not. God remains unmanifest unless you participate. Be a helping mind ."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"36 Telepathic Communication Between Two People How do two people become so connected that they are able to communicate without being in contact physically, speak to each other through telepathy and even feel the same pains? The ability to send to and receive from each other thoughts and feelings comes from a spiritual connection between the two of you. When two people are spiritually close to each other, they are often able to sense what the other is feeling or thinking. Telepathic communication consists of two directions, sending and receiving. It depends on intention . Whether you have the intent to sense what the other person is thinking and feeling, or for the other person to pick up certain thoughts and feelings you are sending. It will be harder for others to sense your thoughts if you want to hide yourself from them. You psychically put up a shield to prevent them from seeing your intentions. The same is also true when others do that. It takes someone of a stronger mind and greater clarity of thinking to penetrate the psychic shields of others to see what they are thinking. When two people are spiritually close, they trust each other and they have mutual empathy. Empathy is one of the key ingredients of telepathy . Telepathy which is of the psychic level of the mind tends to operate beyond pure words and linguistics. It takes place in the form of feelings, images and desires. You may be able to receive telepathic communication from another person in the form of pure words. But usually it comes through a feeling, image or desire. Depending on whether the telepathic message is verbal or nonverbal as well as your dominant mental modality, you might receive the message by instantly knowing it (Paracognition), hearing it from an inner voice in your mind (clairaudience), visualize it (clairvoyance) or feeling it (clairsentience). In non-local telepathy which is psychic communication out of sight, you might sense an emotion that another person is feeling at that time, or you might think of an image that is related to what that person is experiencing, or you could sense what that person is intending to do. All these happens without you being able to read the body language of the person. That psychic message that you get doesn’t seem to be just a thought that you conjure up in your mind out of pure imagination but it comes with the feeling of clarity and inner certainty which is exactly what intuition is made up of. All things at the psychic level operates through the power of belief . In order to send or receive telepathy, you first need to have the belief that you can send and receive telepathy, and that it is going to happen. The methods of telepathy are induction, visualization and will . First induce the emotion, image or desire that you are sending within yourself first. Allow yourself to be experiencing it at that moment. Secondly, visualize your emotion, image or desire traveling to that person and he/she picking it up and experiencing it too. Thirdly, will it to happen and be certain that it has happened the way you intend it to be. Take note that telepathy never fails. The outcome always follows the laws that influence it which are the beliefs and attitudes of both parties and the spiritual connection between them. What we call failure is"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"37 merely feedback about what we are doing . When a message does not seem to get through or it seems distorted, it is simply because of opposing intentions, beliefs, lack of mutual trust. It could even be your own interpretation of the emotions, images and desires that you receive that prevents you from seeing what really is. Being authentic is one of the keys to sending and receiving clear telepathic messages . The virtue of honesty and truth is a spiritual law of reality. When you have a good telepathic connection with someone, you can read each others thoughts easily. So sometimes you do not want the other to know something, such as the correct answer to a question. You can use techniques of counter-telepathy . You can put up a psychic shield by visualizing it and willing that the person can’t read your mind. Or if you want to, you could mislead the person by focusing on an opposite thought or the wrong answer instead. He/she would usually pick up the misleading thought and be mislead. This misleading thought effect also explains why it is so important to watch our thoughts. Sometimes we think certain negative thoughts towards a person when we are momentarily angry or upset. The person may pick these thoughts up and think that is what we really think about him/her when it isn’t our true thoughts . It is alright to think those thoughts for awhile but we must not forget to revert to sending our truer positive thoughts of peace, harmony and well being in between or afterwards, and to send them with equal or greater intensity . Especially to someone we truly love. Finally, it is also about love. When you really love someone, Universal Mind or God will tell you things about that person, because God is love and love connects you to that person spiritually. That person can also sense certain emotions, images and desires from you through the universal mind. Telepathic connection works best when we don’t try to force it. When we know it works, it works . But when we think it might work, it doesn’t work. It is driven more by our subconscious beliefs than by conscious effort. The more we try to force it, the worse we do. The things you tend to send telepathically are the things that you focus on most often . If you focus more often on positive things, you will send positive emotions, images and desires. If you focus more often on negative things, you will send negative emotions, images and desires."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"38 Planes of Reality - Multidimensional Universe There are different planes of reality. The physical plane is the first one. The rest of the other planes beyond it are considered the mental plane as a whole . Of all seven states of matter, the highest state is thought wave. Thought wave is the mental plane of reality. It is the universal plane that is made up purely of thought or mindstuff. The mental plane has many levels. They differ in terms of vibrational rate from one level to the next. The finer the vibration, the higher the plane. It is not actually physically higher in position but inner in dimension . The mental plane of reality begins with the second plane after the physical and onwards. The second plane of reality within the physical plane is the etheric plane . Everything in the physical plane coexists in physical and etheric state. Your body exists simultaneously as solid and thought wave. You coexist in the first and sixth state of matter. An electron exist simultaneously as a particle and a wave. Two things cannot occupy the same space unless they are of different space densities . The physical and etheric plane can coexist in the same space-time because they are out of phase with each other. But the space-time of the physical and etheric planes are in sync with each other. In an OBE or Out of Body Experience, you body is asleep while your consciousness moves out of it. You exist in the form of an etheric or energy body. In that state, your consciousness is out of phase with the physical and is in phase with the etheric. You perceive the physical plane and everything around you in its etheric state . When you were awake, there was a chair beside you. Now when you are in an out of body experience, you will not see the chair existing in a physical state in the physical plane but you will see the chair existing in an etheric state. The rest of the physical plane now exist in etheric state to you. You are now in an etheric double and will be able to see your separate physical body in the etheric state on your bed. You are connected to your physical body with a thin silver cord that keeps it alive. It is unbreakable except on death. Other people who are awake in the physical plane and walking around in their physical bodies can’t see you in your etheric body but you can see them in their etheric bodies. Their etheric bodies appear as the self image that they have of their own physical bodies. A person in the physical plane may look fatter in his etheric or energy body if he is constantly thinking of himself as being fatter than he physically is. The same is true if he think he is thinner, shorter/taller, better/worse looking. In the etheric plane, there may be certain things that do not exist in the physical plane. That is because your imagination creates them in the etheric plane . You need to have certain discerning capability to tell whether something is an etheric state of an object in the physical plane or an etheric object created by your imagination. You can also see angels and fallen angels in the etheric plane if they happen to be around and make themselves visible to you. Hold your hand in front of you and imagine a cup appear on it. Other people might see nothing in your hand but in the etheric plane, it appears as real as it would in the physical plane. An angel or out of body person passing by will see the cup in your hand and can even feel it. They can literally see your thought projections . The same is true when you are in the etheric plane and someone is doing that in the physical plane. The third plane is the astral plane . The astral plane transcends the etheric plane because it does not exist in physical reality at all. It is the place where people go after death or when they are astral traveling. You get to meet other people or heavenly beings existing on that plane. The world you experience around"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"39 you in the astral plane is entirely thought created . What you see will be the result of what you and the people around you are imagining it to be. Hence there are many different levels, places and dimensions in the astral plane. The astral plane may also be called heaven and hell . The lower astral planes are where people with negative energies such as guilt, shame, condemnation are confined to. They experience all kinds of terrible things and sufferings in a plane of chaos and torment. The higher astral planes are where people with positive energies such as eternal life, love, joy and peace cohabit with one another. During a NDE or Near Death Experience, some people see themselves come out of their bodies and angels come down and take them up to heaven. Others see a tunnel of light and pass through to the other side. Still there are those that appear in the presence of Jesus Christ the next moment. These are the positive kinds of NDE, of course there are negative kinds as well where people have horrifying experiences as if they were entering hell. At the end of their NDE, they are told that their time is not up and should return to the land of the living or they feel a force pulling them back to their physical bodies. The reason why people have different NDE is because they expect different kinds of experience after death. God allows them to have the kind of experience they expect to have when they pass from Earth to Heaven . It doesn’t matter how they transition because they will still end up in the astral plane anyway. The astral plane can be considered to be a collective dream plane where people interact with each other in a fantasy land. Normal low level dreaming takes place in the dream plane which is at the lowest level of the Energy continuum, just below the human collective consciousness and in the area of personal consciousness or the psyche. Here the subconscious mind will create its own astral ether, often based upon waking thoughts and in particular, the last thoughts of the mind before drifting off to sleep. That is why it is important to take positive and harmonious thoughts to sleep with you. The difference between the dream plane from the etheric and astral planes is that of shared reality. In the dream plane, no one else experiences what you are dreaming directly. But in the etheric and astral planes, you experience a shared reality with other beings existing in them. When two or more people experience a shared dream, they are actually interacting with each other during OBE or astral travel. It is possible for others to influence your dreams through telepathic influence. Beings from the astral planes such as loved ones who has passed on can also enter your dreams to communicate with you. The forth plane is the mental plane . The mental plane is the place where your imagination resides. This is where you draw inspiration and ideas from. A thought that you have, first originated from the mental plane within you . It then passes outwards to the astral plane and then to the etheric plane and finally to the physical plane of your existence. Things in your imagination will affect the physical plane. The mental plane is a spectacular dimension! Iridescent rivers of sound bounded by rainbow shores of pulsating light. Thoughts appear as kaleidoscopic patterns of light and sound. You walk across fields of ideas under a sparkling crystal sky of inspiration. If you enter this world don’t try to rationalize or understand it, or you may go mad, for it is beyond human understanding. Just accept it all, go with the flow and enjoy it! Exist here in wondrous amazement. Let loose the child within you to play in this fairy wonderland. Everything feels real and solid. Time is even further distorted here than in the astral and reality is kaleidoscopic . The astral plane is the lower heaven and the mental plane is the higher heaven. The astral plane is where the soul exist, the mental plane is where the spirit exist."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"40 The fifth plane is the celestial plane . It is the plane where the angelic hierarchy exist . From the seven archangels, seraphs, cherubs and all the angelic hosts of God’s heavenly kingdom. It is a plane full of the glory of God and the might of his power. The sixth plane is the cosmic plane . Here is where everyone is in the most glorified form, radiant, shining bright, pure brilliance, dazzling and sparkling . It is the most beautiful and most positive state of existence. Everyone interacts with the greatest joy and the highest love with one another. You can feel the presence of God as a tangible all pervading force . Time stands utterly still here. Reality is more real and solid than normal reality. Compared to this, the physical world is a vague, tired dream full of half dead people. The seventh plane is the divine plane or The Source . It is the highest mental plane which is the plane of pure Spirit or pure Mind. It is the state where all things ultimately exist as. Pure consciousness, pure energy. Perception of form does not exist and does not need to exist. You are one with everything and everyone, there is no separation. In this plane, you are one with God . Your Spirit is one with the Universal Spirit. Your mind is integrated and yet differentiated with the Universal Mind. A state of total, perfect and eternal bliss. It isn’t necessary to experience eternal life only on the mental plane. When we are in our new glorified bodies, we are able to change our vibration at will . We can pass through walls, appear and disappear, fly in all levels of reality whether physical or mental. To experience and transition across all planes of reality in cycles is the most wonderful way to experience Heaven for all Eternity. Since all levels of the mental plane are made purely of thought wave and the physical plane is a condensation of thought wave, you can say that the physical world is simply a dream world in a more condensed form . So we are living in a dream right now and we awaken out of the physical plane whenever we move into the next one. The real world is the dream world. The dream world is the real world. Everything is a dream. Everything is reality. Dream is Reality. Reality is Dream."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"41 Mental Matrix of Reality - World is Simulation Some people think that the physical universe is different from the mental planes of reality. But the physical universe is really not as physical as it seems. In fact, it is just another layer of the mental universe . Time and space does not exist in the physical universe only, it also does exist on the other planes of reality. Except it is experienced differently on those planes. The entire universe is a hologram. The world is simply a simulation, like a computer program. All levels of reality are part of that same program. Everything physical is only a concept in the mind of God. As he imagines it to be, we experience it to be. Reality is a mental construct . The rules of physics are just there to “govern” how the physical universe operates . The universal mind which governs the laws of the physical universe only allows it them to be superceded when it permits. We are living in the matrix . This is not a computer generated but a mind generated world . It is generated by the universal mind which is partly the mind of God and partly the collective consciousness of the people alive. Do our five senses really operate as energy receptors carry energy in the form of electrical impulses along nerves to the brain in order to be processed by the mind as information? Are we really not able to see the world around us when the electrical impulses are cut off? Does our life support system really operate as blood carrying oxygen from the air that we breathe to our body cells in order to nourish and repair them? Are we really not able to process energy without the means of our blood? While looking at your feet, stomp on the ground. You will notice that your visual perception of your foot hitting the floor matches your sensation of touching it. This would be fine except for one thing: the speed of light is vastly faster than the conduction times and synaptic delays through the long nerves and spinal cord from your feet. As a result, you should be seeing the event before you feel it and the delay should be noticeable. Scientist can study how the physical system operates in order to work with it. We have to follow the rules of a system when we are in it, in order to function in it. But the physical system is only a simulation to provide logic and order to how reality operates on the physical level . The simulation is only a mask over how true reality operates. We do not actually see with electrical impulses being sent from our eyes to our brains through the channel of nerves. We sense energy directly with our mind. We do not actually live with oxygen flooding our cells through the use of blood. We absorb energy directly from the universal field of energy. We perceive everything as energy directly with consciousness. When we think, we think as conscious mind. When a thought becomes substantiated, it substantiates in the subconscious mind. But what is man’s subconscious mind? It is his mental field or frequency in Universal Subjectivity. There is no such thing as your subjective mind and my subjective mind, meaning two, for this would be duality. All mind is One Mind. But there is such a thing as the subconscious state of your thought and of my thought in Mind. When we think, we think through a Universal Creative Medium , a receptive and plastic substance which surrounds us on all sides, which permeates us and flows through us. When we think, we think through and into the One Common Mind producing points of mental activity within it. We exist as the universal mind differentiated into individual minds. We think as universal conscious mind through the Universal Subconscious medium. As each person thinks, he is building around himself a mental atmosphere. Nothing can enter unless he allows it to, through the avenues of his own thought whether conscious or unconscious. There is no other place that we could think, since Mind is Omnipresent. There is no out there . Everything exist as projections in the external world from within ourselves. Even the experience of internal to external projection itself is an experience in our Mind. It is a projection of consciousness within consciousness ."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"42 There really is no external or internal for everything is at one place where Mind is. Mind is everywhere yet nowhere. Mind is nowhere but Here, Now. Everything is created by consciousness and nothing is outside of consciousness. Our heart is our subconscious mind. The Universal Field of Subjectivity is the key to understanding what it means when we say someone is always with us because that person is in our heart. We might see, hear and touch the person, but that is just a means of experiencing each other through physical form. Of course Spirit must manifest into form in order to express itself . But once we experienced each other physically, we know that we are always connected to each other no matter where we are. There is no separation. The person exist in Universal Subconscious which is in our heart. That person is in us literally. Metaphysics of Time, Space and Things. Time simply measures change . Beyond that simple function, time is nonexistent. There is really only the “now”. “Time is a sequence of events in a Unitary Whole.” Time is not a thing of itself, it is simply a measure of experience in eternity. Time does not contradict Eternity, but allows It to become expressed in terms of definite experience . Time is necessary since it allows experience to take place within the One, but time is never a thing of itself. It is really impossible to measure time. For yesterday is gone and tomorrow has not come, and today is rapidly slipping into the past. If we were to attempt to put a finger on any period of time it would be gone before we could point to it. But, illusive as time is, it is still necessary to experience. Space, like time, is not a thing of itself, but is only the outline of form . It is a relative distance within the Absolute. Space is also necessary to the expression of Spirit, for without it no definite form could be produced . We must not be confused over the ideas of time and space, as they are not things of themselves. They are entirely relative, but none the less necessary. Things are mean forms in time and space . Things are always results and never make themselves; they are the objectifications of Spirit. Things are necessary to the manifestation of Spirit. They are the result of the Self-Knowingness of the Word of God. Things vary in size and shape, in time and duration, from the planet to the peanut, from a moment to an eternity. It is necessary that Spirit should manifest in SOME KIND OF FORM in order that It may come into Self-Expression through Self-Realization. The world is waking up to the fact that things are not at all what they appear to be, that matter and form are but the one substance appearing and disappearing, and that form is simply used to express something which is formless , self-conscious life. Form in the astral world is not as definite as form in the physical world. But the physical world is not as definite as it seems because it is governed by true reality , and true reality is highly fluid. Physical reality and mental reality and different levels of the same program, running with a different set of parameters . The difference between the physical world and the astral world is that of time. Change happens slower on the physical plane because energy moves at a slower rate on their plane but on the astral plane, things can happen very quickly. There is only one place that is far more definite than physical reality. It is a place where you really can’t change the conditions in it with your mind. It’s vibrations are the lower and denser than Earth. That place is Hell. Beings that exist there will forever be tormented with fire in anguish, pain and misery. It is where things are truly hopeless and there is nothing you can do about it. Hell is the condition of having no alternatives. Both heaven and hell are real places, but while on Earth, your experience can either be a heaven or hell depending on whether you live in higher consciousness where anything is possible and change can happen fast, or hell consciousness where things are hopeless and impossible. The physical plane is where the challenge is . It is a loss to give up living in the physical world and to enter the astral world just because one is in despair of the difficulties in manifesting desires on that plane. It is precisely for that reason that we are truly able to develop and test our powers of mind in order to fulfill our"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"43 realization as spirit beings. The purpose of physicality is to lock different beings into common dimensional arenas of interaction, so they can evolve via that interaction . Gaining the ability to be in control of reality at the physical level is gaining the ability to be in control of our own minds to the fullest degree. Ruling and reigning over reality is expressing who we are as sons and daughters of God, created in the true spiritual image of God ."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"44 Mental Control of Physical Reality When you go to sleep and are in a state of dreaming, can you see, hear, touch, smell and taste things? Are the objects you touch as solid as in the physical world? In experience, there is no difference between the dream world and the real world . What you imagine is in every way as real as what you experience in physical reality . There is a way you can tell when you are in the dream world though. It feels different , there is a different frequency to it. When you are conscious that you are dreaming, you are in a lucid dream. You can control the dream in anyway you want according to your will and belief. If that is possible in the dream world, it is also possible in the real world. The difference is that the mental plane responds instantaneously to your thoughts while the physical plane is much slower in playing them out. That is because the vibrations of physical reality are finer and hence the grosser forms of matter are slower to change . Things on the physical plane take time to manifest but things on the mental plane manifest instantaneously the moment they are thought of. The mental plane is not affected by time the same way as the physical plane. It is concentration of thought sustained over time that brings an idea into physical being. Everything that exist in the imagination or dream is a personal experience. If an object or person you imagine exists in actual reality, the object or person in your mind is a clone of the original . The mental clone is in every way as real as the actual object or person. But If the object or person you imagine does not exist in actual reality, it will be an original creation of yours that exist in your mind. The mental creation can manifest in physical reality over time if it is concentrated upon long enough for the necessary actions to take place to bring it into existence. In quantum physics, consciousness collapses the wave function into particles in time and space. That is how God created the universe. It was through pure condensation of thought wave into other states of matter . But God or the universal mind does not require us to create things directly from thought in the physical world. Our thoughts normally manifest physically through indirect means. A goal is first manifested in the psychic plane and then action is taken to materialize it on the earth plane. Just like consciousness pull together Quanta or Energy to form physical objects through direct mental manifestation , our thoughts will also pull together the different materials needed to form the object in the physical world through indirect mental manifestation . Things in the physical world tend to manifest through natural patterns of growth . Just like a seed grows into tree progressing from roots to stem, branches, leaves, flowers and fruit. It takes time, investment and work. All growth can be accelerated, slowed, stunted, warped and even reversed. When you have a picture of a car that you want to construct, by concentrating on it and putting all your energies to it, the car will eventually be constructed. You begin by thinking more and more about the car you have in mind. You allow your actions to flow with your intentions as you put it into design. You then seek the people, materials and resources necessary to build the car. Your constant focus sends out thought waves that attract the right people to you and you to them. You all begin working on constructing the car and refining it until finally the work is complete and the car which first existed as an idea in your mind is now a physical reality before you. This is how our dreams and desires manifest in physical reality. Concentration is the Great Secret of mental power ."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"45 When you are in a situation where your actions have immediate control in its outcome, you should concentrate on what you are doing and do it as well as you can . When a situation is outside of your immediate control and there is nothing you can do to physically act upon it, you should concentrate on thinking the right thoughts , imagine what you desire to happen and mentally will it to happen. When the object you imagine is a mental clone of an existing object in actual reality, it will affect the object in actual reality. Your thoughts will influence the thought wave state of the actual thing you are thinking about . This explains why you can influence other people’s behavior with your imagination and affect physical things with your mind. This power can be used for good or evil. A Voodoo doll is merely a physical symbol for the user to focus his/her imagination upon. There is no need for such rituals and ceremonies as witchcraft and sorcery as the original workings of things are purely mental. You can heal a person with your mind just as much as you can harm them. You can only have power over them according to the power they give to you through the thoughts they think . The same is true for you to others as well. Be more positive and less negative. Of all seven states of matter, thought wave is the most easy to mentally affect. Mind is most responsive to thought waves than any other element in the environment . The finer the state, the easier it is to affect. The denser the matter, the harder and more concentration it takes to affect. Mental movement of mind . You can mentally move people towards or away from you simply by willing that they come or stay away from you. You can make them feel what you want them to feel or think what you want them to think according to the thought waves you send out to them. Mental movement of beam . Certain places or people have a darkness about them. The negative thought waves emanating from them has an effect on the electromagnetic waves or light sources surrounding them. Other places or people appear to be glowing or shining bright with radiance on their countenance and presence. The effect is both mental and electromagnetic. Mental movement of gas . The thoughts and moods of people can affect the atmosphere around them. There are situations when the air seem to behave in a turbulent manner in response to their own mental turbulence going on within them. There are times when the atmosphere is so calm and so still because you are in a state of inner calm and stillness. Mental movement of water . Dr Emoto discovered that water crystals take shape according to the characteristics of words and prayer. He found that water could be “treated” or changed by our thoughts. He filled bottles with water and wrote different words on them. He was fascinated by the differences generated in the crystal when the water was shown different words, such as “gratitude” or “stupid.” The most beautiful, intricate images came from words such as “angel, wisdom, you’re cute, thank you, love, and gratitude.” Words such as “Satan, you fool, stupid and kill” produced blurred, chaotic and dark images. The water crystals are the design and image of the vibrations provided,” he explains. “By and large, the positive vibration demonstrates well-formed water crystals and its crystallization rate tends to be higher than others commonly recognized as negative vibrations.” If water can respond to our thoughts, so can everything else in the universe . Is water really alive? Water is simply water just like oxygen is simply oxygen. Water does not have any cells, it is simply an elemental form of matter. If everything is alive, it can respond to you and when you command it will obey. Everything is truly conscious, living energy. Our thoughts really affect the material world . Our very thoughts can affect the molecules of the physical things around us. Ever wondered why the same electronic product in the possession of one person seem to function better than with another person? Think about the enormous impact that this priceless understanding could have on the world of warranty and guarantees! We literally have the power to make things last longer and perform better with our mind ."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"46 Think about the effect our thoughts, words and labels have on our bodies, our clothes, our furniture, our things and every aspect of our lives! They have the power to preserve, to enhance or to spoil . Mental movement of solid objects is supposedly the hardest to achieve since they are the densest state of matter. It takes more skill in mental power to move solid objects with the mind than other states of matter. As long as you perceive yourself as moving something that is separate from you, you will not find it possible to do. All separation is an illusion . The entire universe and everything in it at the quantum level is a continuous flow of pure energy that is consciousness and Mind . Every person or object is an aspect of the same energy of God that we all consist of. It is thought that influences objects to move, and all objects are energy. While we think about moving “that pencil” or “that door” or “that candle flame” or “that” anything; it will be not be possible to move it. When we move anything we move an aspect of ourselves, always . Just like a hand or a leg. Since everything is ultimately thought wave in different states and thought wave is Mind, it is Mind moving Itself . Mind over Matter is really Mind over Mind. Therefore telekinesis, also known as “ psychokinesis “, may be defined as: “ The process of moving an aspect of ourselves by influencing Energy using the power of the Mind “. Feeling or frequency is how we communicate with things . This is how psychokinesis works. We put our mind in the mental state or frequency that is in synch with the object in order to move it. If you wanted to float an apple across the room, do you just tell the apple “Hey apple! I command you to float across the room!”? No. It is an internal frequency or feeling we think that moves it . Understanding our sixth sense opens up our paranormal abilities . If you can perceive, you can also exert . Energy can move in two directions, in and out. It is easier to influence things in a dynamic state than in a static state. Things in a dynamic state are already in the process of changing from one state to another. Things in motion continue to be in motion and it takes lesser force to redirect them. It takes a lot more energy to move something at rest. But the truth is all limits are mental. The only thing stopping you is the mind. The only thing that can free you is the mind. You are the mind. You are the one restricting or liberating yourself. All obstacles are mental blocks . Remember there are no rules, there are no limits. If you can believe then all things will be equal in your ability to mentally move them . Moving a mountain would be as easy as moving a grain of sand. There is no limit to the power of the Mind . The entire Universe is the infinite Mind of God, and as Sons and Daughters of God we are blessed with the same infinite powers of the Mind. Remember, our ability to affect matter with our mind is governed by the universal mind . We are only able to affect matter according to how our thoughts fit in with the flow of life and the forces of other minds. It is easier to influence things in the direction where they are going than the against it ."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"47 Gravity is Mind Attracting Mind Gravity is the result of energy attracting energy. All matter is energy. Energy is consciousness. All consciousness seeks to unite and become one . The oneness nature of the universe is what causes everything to be held together as a single whole . A body of mass seeks to join a greater body of mass. The largest body of mass will have the highest attracting force. Everything gravitates to something bigger than itself. The greater body of mass is not greater is size but in amount. One body of mass would have more attracting power than another of equal size if it has greater density. All energy is consciousness and consciousness is mind. To understand the attractive force of consciousness is to understand gravity. Gravity is mind attracting mind . A person with a stronger mind and more powerful thought waves will attract other minds to his own. Other people will gravitate towards his ideas and follow his thoughts. Gravity is the Law of Attraction at work in all dimensions of reality . Energy of the same vibration attract other. Energy of different vibrations repel each other. The more similar in vibration, the more they attract. The more different in vibration, the further they repel. Scientists mention an unknown force that holds all the particles of an atom together but separated at a perfectly ordered distance that is in the ratio of phi (1.618). The distance between the planets and the sun are also in the ratio of phi. The densest planets are closest to the sun. The less dense ones are further away. Things do not repel indefinitely. They only repel to a certain distance at then stay in that proximity according to the ratio of their vibrational difference . In the physical world, helium rises upwards away from the ground because it is so fine in vibration that it repels from the dense mass of the Earth until it reaches a certain distance in the atmosphere where it remains in the attraction field of the Earth. In the world of thought, your attract the objects, people and resources that are in harmony with the thoughts you think. Your mind attracts like minded people and repel unlike minded ones. Increasing the difference in vibration (kinetic energy) between two objects is the secret of anti-gravity . Fire always burn upwards and not downwards. Electromagnetic waves travel upwards more easily than downwards. Positive and harmonious thought waves tend to travel upwards. Negative and discordant thought waves tend to travel downwards. Mass is the measure of an object’s resistance to changes in either the speed or direction of its motion. Finer vibrations change speed or direction more easily than denser ones. Violet gets refracted the most while red the least. Positive moods are easier to change than negative ones. It takes more focus and will to stay positive than it does to remain negative. Changing from positive to negative is easier than changing from negative to positive. That is the challenge, the stronger you are the more positive you can be . The weaker you are, the more negative you will be. Gravity has a lesser effect in the dream world. When you are dreaming, things will always feel lighter. Large objects that would hurt you in the physical world don’t seem to hurt you when they collide against you in a dream. Everything is of a lower mass including yourself."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"48 When you skip and hop, your landing is slower and much softer. Sometimes you can even fly if your mind is free enough . Otherwise you will keep getting pulled back to the ground as you rise and fall in cycles. In fact, gravity exists on all planes of reality. Gravity is stronger in the morning because the surface is moving in the direction of the Earth’s orbit. Everything feels heavier. The air is denser and condenses to form dew. The more things move together in the same direction, the less difference in kinetic energy between them. Like minded people tend to move together in the same direction. Moving people together in the same direction cause them to become like minded. You can always use the Laws of Mind as the Laws of Physics and vice versa . The world within and the world without are a mirror of each other. As above so below, as below so above."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"49 Black Holes are Portals from one Plane to Another We have been questioning about where a black hole in our universe lead to. But have we ever considered that we and our entire physical universe is actually a black hole itself? A black hole that is from another universe? A black hole is a singularity. Our physical universe is one continuous flow of energy. So it is a singularity. If our physical universe is a black hole from another universe, then that universe must be infinitely larger than ours. Probably even beyond the dimensions of time and space itself. The answer is that, the physical universe is a black hole from the astral plane. If our universe is a black hole from the astral plane, then where does a black hole in our universe lead to? When something enters a black hole in our universe, it becomes so compressed until it is beyond the dimensions of time and space. It disappears out of physical reality and enters a different plane of reality. A black hole in the physical universe is a portal to the astral plane. You can say that a black hole opening up on the other side of a plane of reality is a white hole. The connection between the two planes would be called a wormhole. All theories of the stable existence of a wormhole have fallen apart except for one. It is the stable existence of the wormhole as the result of matter on one side and exotic matter on the other side. Any matter that enters a black hole in our universe including light will not be able to exit out into the other side or out the same side. The theory for matter to escape is that it must become negative in mass, or exotic matter. The theory of negative mass is like anti gravity matter. In this state, it can exit the black hole. The truth is, exotic matter is not matter with negative mass. There is no such thing as negative mass. Everything has mass, being negative in value compared to another is simply a relative term. Exotic matter is simply matter that is less dense than light. It is matter that has changed in rate of vibration to the point it becomes finer than beam. In this case, exotic matter would be etheric matter . Anything that is less dense than light would be repelled by normal gravity from physical matter but attracted by etheric gravity from etheric matter. Thus objects with negative gravitational mass (both passive and active), but with positive inertial mass, would be expected to be repelled by positive (physical) active masses, and attracted to negative (etheric) active masses. Gravity would work similarly to the electric force except that like masses would attract and unlike masses would repel. In the physical plane, anything that enters a black hole will be compressed beyond the physical dimensions of time and space and become thought wave or etheric matter. Thought wave is the only thing that is free to go wherever it wants to. Thought wave can’t be trapped in the middle of a wormhole. People who travel through a tunnel a light into the astral plane during OBE or after death, are in fact traveling through a black hole in etheric state. They pass out of the etheric state of physical reality and into the astral plane. An etheric black hole opens up right where he is in the etheric plane the moment he imagines himself traveling through a tunnel of light into the astral plane. A person in an OBE is in etheric state which is thought wave. He can pass through the worm hole to the astral plane and back easily. On the physical/etheric side, he is thought wave in the etheric state. On the astral side, he is thought wave in the astral state. When you enter a black hole of the physical plane in physical state, you will cease to exist physically and"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"50 have died to the physical dimension. It is better to enter in the etheric state instead, since you cannot return to the physical plane if your physical body has disappeared from physical reality unless the universal mind allows you to manifest in temporal physical form. Anything that enters a black hole of the astral plane which is timeless and spaceless will collapse into physical time and space. Just like the double slit experiment where a wave is collapsed into a particle in time and space. It will exist purely in the etheric thought wave state or be condensed into any other state of matter according to the will of the universal mind. The truth is, black holes are not needed for inter-plane traveling because all that is required is just the change in rate of vibration. Black holes, tunnels, portals are just forms of experience in passing through from one plane to the other. So understanding the true nature of a black hole brings the relation of the seven states of matter to completion or full circle. A black hole in the physical universe transforms all other states of matter to the zero state, and then to the sixth state directly. From Matter Wave to Thought Wave. So this is the full cycle of manifest of the physical universe. Matter changes state from thought wave to beam, to plasma, to gas, to liquid, to solid, to matter wave and back to thought wave. From the Ether to the black hole and back to the Ether . From Alpha to Omega to Alpha. A black hole is the beginning of the end. There is a time dilation close to a black hole for an outside observer and everything moves very slowly there, almost stops. The galaxies can move billions of light years but close to a black hole it is a tiny movement only. When we are close to the astral plane, physical time around us slows down while physical time away from us continues as usual. When space compresses, time expands . From the physical point of view, our space has collapsed. But from our point, our space is normal. From the physical point of view, our time has expanded. But from our point, our time is normal. Physical time has been frozen and physical space does not even exist in our dimension."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"51 Antimatter is Etheric Double of Physical Matter The entire universe is made up of matter in different states. The quantum building blocks of matter are atoms and subatomic particles. Every subatomic particle has a positive or negative charge. For every particle with a positive or negative charge, there must be an equivalent particle of a negative mass or with an opposite charge to balance its existence. We would not be able to distinguish between a negative mass and a negative charge, either would produce an acceleration opposite to the electric field. So that means for every particle there must be an antiparticle and all matter has antimatter as its opposite counterpart. If that is the case, then where is all the antimatter in the universe? They seem to be missing. The idea is that antimatter and matter cannot coexist because if they did, they would destroy each other immediately upon contact and disappear. So how can matter exist without antimatter? It is a great mystery that the physical universe seems to exist in an unbalanced state of existence. There may not be an imbalance. The antimatter may be present within the matter as a quantum superposition , we just do not “observe” it until we look for it. The solution to the mystery can only be found in understanding that there are two planes of reality coexisting in the same spacetime but out of phase with each other . Everything in physical reality exist in two states, the physical state and the etheric state. Physical matter and its etheric double coexist in the same spacetime but out of phase with each other on two different planes of reality. Antimatter is the etheric double of physical matter. Physical reality exists as the physical plane on this side and the etheric plane on the other side. On this side, the electron is the original and the positron is the anti. On the other side, the positron is the original and the electron is the anti. On the other side, we are the original and we are the anti on this side. An electron has a negative charge, therefore it has an antiparticle of a positive charge called a positron. Like and unlike charges attract, therefore the electron and its etheric double are held together in the same space time and out of phase on different planes. The positron’s mass is the inverse of the physical electron. Of course since there is no such thing as negative mass, antimatter is really matter that is less dense than light . The etheric double of the electron is not directly perceivable on the physical plane through physical means. But when the etheric double swaps places with the electron, it becomes detectable. The electron appears on the etheric plane as an etheric positron while the etheric double appears on the physical plane a physical positron. Their masses reverse and so do their charges. Light is made up of photons. A photon is a chargeless particle, therefore there is no anti-photon. The photon and anti-photon are one and the same. Light is the only thing that can coexist in the physical and etheric plane in the same state . Light is the link between the Physical and Etheric plane . Light is an etheric matter. Etheric matter is matter that can pass through physical matter. Light is the only thing that can pass through solid. Visible light can pass through glass and transparent material. Invisible light such as X-Ray and gamma rays can penetrate through various solid matter. When an electron and a positron combine, they become two photons. When two photons combine, they turn into an electron with a positron. You can transform matter into light and light into matter!

So it is not too far fetched an idea to think that holograms can become solid . Light is beam and beam is the fifth state of matter. Condensing from beam into solid is how angelic beings or spirits manifest into physical existence. Light is the final state of matter that can be visibly observed with our physical eyes. Quantum physicist David Bohm describes the physical universe of matter as “ frozen light ”. The entire universe from the innermost to the outermost planes is a grand holographic projection with everything and everyone an integral and inseparable aspect of the Universal Hologram . Light is the Link between Matter and Spirit. There is light in the body . Biophotons are ultra weak photon or electromagnetic wave emissions of biological systems in the optical range of the spectrum, which is light. All living cells of plants, animals and human beings emit biophotons which cannot be seen by the naked eye but can be measured by special scientific equipment.This light emission is an expression of the functional state of the living organism and its measurement can be used to evaluate this state. Cancer cells and healthy cells can be discriminated by typical differences in biophoton emission. We have a body of matter and a body of light . The human body has a holographic biophoton field. It is part of the etheric or energy body. The biophoton field is the mediator between body and soul . Biophoton light is stored in the cells of the organism or more precisely, in the DNA. The holographic biophoton field of the brain, the nervous system and of the whole organism is the basis of memory and other phenomena of consciousness. The consciousness-like coherence properties of the biophoton field are closely related to its base in the properties of the physical vacuum, Ether or Universal Mind and indicate its role as an interface to the non- physical realms of mind, psyche and consciousness. When someone experiences “ghost pains” after amputation of some part of the body, it is the etheric body through which they are feeling the discomfort. Many people who experience amputation for quite some time will feel as if the missing part of the body is still there. Which it is, in the etheric template. Coming to the forefront in medical astronomy will be the ability to regenerate body components through proper understanding and stimulation of the Etheric Body Template of Light . The etheric body is not only alive but is the giver of life to the physical body! Light is produced by vibrations of matter propagated under the form of waves in the ether. An eye with a retina sensitive enough would see in the dark all objects as if surrounded by a luminous halo, and darkness would be unknown to it. We can see light beyond our usual range of spectrum simply by changing the vibration of our consciousness . People and animals who have the ability to see beyond the range of visible light can see infrared as dark red and ultraviolet as dark purple, dark blue or black. When you use your Etheric Vision , you are able to see invisible light such as ultraviolet, x rays and gamma rays. When we are in the etheric state of being or having heightened sense of etheric vision operating, we will experience a full spectrum color shift . Which means that our perceptive range of visible colors will shift one octave higher. All the normal visible colors we see will shift to dark red or even black, while the higher frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum shifts into standard colors . We will be able to see ultraviolet, x-rays and gamma rays in the color range from red to indigo. Ultraviolet will appear red and gamma rays will appear indigo. Every other frequency in between will appear as the rest of the colors."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"53 Of course we can choose to see both visible light and invisible light as normal colors simultaneously if we want to.

When they refer to the mind, they are refering to the intellect, the linguistic, the reason or any faculties that are only certain aspects of the mind. The heart, the emotion, the feeling is also the mind. The intuition and the instinct is the mind. The autonomic system of the body is the mind. The soul, the entire psyche, the will and desire, the conscious and the subconscious, anything you can think of in this aspect is also the mind. They are all mental.

Intuition and intellect may be different on one level of understanding, but on another level, intuition is actually higher intellect. It is intellect that is above the ordinary level because it comes directly from higher intelligence. Good and evil exist as the result of whether we are in tune with our higher mind or not . When we are in tune with our higher mind, we access divine guidance and do what is in harmony with the universal mind. When we are not in tune with our higher mind, we lack divine guidance and we go astray doing what isn’t right for ourselves and the universe. All mistakes are mistakes of ignorance.

Thoughts of Truth will overcome thoughts of error. God is Truth. When we think the way God thinks, our mind is in harmony with the universal mind, we are walking in the Light and not Darkness. To think like God, we must know God . The more we know, the more we become. To know is to be. The more we know God, the more we become like God. The fallen nature is the ignorant nature. The new nature is the enlightened nature. Salvation is by Knowledge of the Truth. To know God is to know ourselves. To know our higher self or true self is to know God.

It is awareness that puts you in a position of being a master player instead of a pawn on a chessboard. You can’t think of everything and produce all knowledge yourself as fast as you could by using other people’s minds, thinking and knowledge. Unifying knowledge of others and your own is the best way to achieve greater awareness in the most efficient way . It is the fastest possible way to gain power. It’s all about speed and power. Fear is power being projected outside of us. If you belief you have no power over something, you become afraid it can harm you. Doubt is not believing in our power to create a desired outcome for a situation. It is all based on belief. Belief based on awareness or ignorance. All power is from within, and is absolutely within your control . No power is without. Everything that happens without is happening within. All of reality is in your mind. From a reality creation perspective, fear and doubt can become two of your best friends. When you’re feeling afraid or powerless, or feeling doubt about the outcome of a situation, it’s a chance to step back and say: “Aha, here is another area for me to reclaim my power.” Fear and doubt are transformed from something which blocked you from achieving your goals, to friendly advisors who wave bright orange flags at any place in your life where you don’t believe in your own power. The only cause of fear is ignorance. The opposite of fear is a sense of power. Knowledge is power. To move from powerless to power is to move from not knowing to knowing. Wisdom, understanding, prudence, intelligence are all knowledge . They are all knowledge of one type or another. Knowing and knowingness is knowledge. Anyone who thinks this or that is different from knowledge is thinking of knowledge in the partial sense. Knowledge in the total sense encompasses everything there is about consciousness. The purest definition of knowledge is awareness. Awareness of anything and everything . Awareness is power, the more you have it, the more power you have over every area of life. Perception is the key to solving all our problems . Understanding the problem dissolves the problem. Awareness is power because awareness gives you choice. Choice is an illusion created by those in control for those who are not. To be in control, you must know. You must know how things work and understand what is going on. You need awareness to make conscious choices. Awareness is the first step, the second step is change. You should understand what you intend to change and the reasons behind it. Knowledge brings awareness therefore knowledge is power. All of life is a learning experience for you to become all you can be. All knowledge is self knowledge. In the end it is all about discovering ourselves. The world without is a reflection of the world within. By learning about the universe, we understand our inner universe. The reverse is also true."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"57 The greatest thing in the universe is mind. Therefore the greatest knowledge is knowledge of mind . Mind is the governing dynamic over all governing dynamics of reality. Mental knowledge is mental power. Mental power is the ultimate power of all. The ultimate mind is the universal mind. The universal mind is the universal spirit. Knowledge of the universal mind is ultimate mental power . Mental knowledge is spiritual knowledge. Mental power is spiritual power because Mind and Spirit are one. Transformation comes from renewing of mind. When your awareness advances to the next level, change automatically happens. What you know, you are. Knowing is being. Being leads to doing. The ability to do anything comes from knowledge. Knowledge is what enables us to move anywhere . All action is movement. All movement is mental. Knowledge can come in all ways. The aim is to acquire as much as possible so that we can gain more range of movement. The more we know, the more freedom we have to maneuver and the further we can transverse in any direction. The more freely we can move, the more unstoppable we are . The more nothing can hold us back or stand in our way, the more powerful we are. Knowledge is power. Freedom comes from knowing the truth . Knowledge, power and freedom are one . Get to the core and the essence . Understand how things happen in the natural way, and how to do things in the natural way . There is no doing but nondoing in that way. One’s inferior natural work is better than superior unnatural work. It is the simplest knowledge and first principles you need that can bring you everything you want in life . Every other supposedly advanced forms of knowledge are just spin offs from the simple ones. There is not a lot but only a little to know, for the little is everything . All you need is the simple awareness that helps you realize the truth in order to free your mind in the natural direction . And to keep being reminded of those knowledge from one to the next, from time to time in order to bring them all back to our yet to be fully solidified consciousness in physical reality. This is the process of our mental shaping and spiritual completion. You have to get the right foundation in order to engage everything else with it . All knowledge can be organized and reorganized. Essence is the primary thing. Organization is the secondary. As long as everything written in a particular work of knowledge is real substance and not fluff, it is well written. The less fluff there is, the less wastage of mind . The better organized the knowledge, the greater order of mind. The more focused, ordered and clear the mind is, the more powerful it is. No young man can hope to do anything above the commonplace who has not made his life a reservoir of power on which he can constantly draw , which will never fail him in any emergency. Be sure that you have stored away, in your power-house, the energy, the knowledge that will be equal to the great occasion when it comes. “If I were twenty, and had but ten years to live,” said a great scholar and writer, “I would spend the first nine years accumulating knowledge and getting ready for the tenth.” They say that applied knowledge is power. The truth is, action naturally follows consciousness. To know and not do, is not yet to know . When you know and not do, it means you have not really known enough to be compelled to act automatically yet. You just have to know some more until your actions begin to flow with your intentions. When knowledge becomes your thoughts, your thoughts control your being and doing. It is also true that knowing alone is not enough but you have to use what you know . This is what you have to know as well. Know that you have to use what you know and use it."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"58 If any man thinks he knows (Eido - understand spiritually) any thing, he knows (Ginosko - experiential knowing) nothing yet as he ought to know. Head knowledge needs to be accompanied by experiencial knowing . Spiritual Evolution is about acquiring Gnosis, Illumination, Enlightenment and Awareness. Reading the word of God is for the purpose of increasing in wisdom, understanding, spiritual intelligence and discernment. Transformation of Mind is transformation of Being. Some people have the idea that believing in spiritual things is enough without experiencing. But that is so wrong. Experience is crucial for true knowing . Intellectual comprehension of faith, love and the workings of the universe is important and absolutely necessary. But these things must also be experienced to be truly known. We are here to live and to experience the things of God as a reality . When you experience something powerfully, nothing can take it away from you . Remember that all experiences are mental in whatever form or level they take place. Even if you have all knowledge, you still have the free will to choose your thoughts . Since thought and knowledge are one, to know correctly is to think correctly. Wrong thinking is ignorance. Right thinking is knowledge. The only evil is ignorance. The only good is knowledge. To sin is to sin through ignorance. Ignorance is the only evil that leads to all other forms of evil including pride, malice and hatred. Choose to think correctly. All knowledge is mental. All knowledge is one knowledge."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"59 Conscious, Subconscious and Superconscious are One People usually think we have a conscious and subconscious mind that are apart from each other. The truth is, it is all consciousness. It is all one mind . What we think of as one aspect of the subconscious is actually an inner level of consciousness . By moving our awareness inwards, we make the unconscious conscious. We begin to know what we are really conscious of at a deeper level. This is how we tune into our intuition. Inner consciousness is more powerful than outer consciousness. For that reason, you could say that the subconscious is greater than consciousness. But the definition of consciousness being used here is the total and true one. It is the Awareness Consciousness . It can move across different dimensions of the mind. It can travel inwards and outwards. The subconscious is also the consciousness of the body. The body is another aspect of the subconscious mind . Our physiology affects our emotions because when we do something with our body, we are causing it to think in a certain way. Our body is a different form of mind existing and working together alongside ours. We can say that this aspect of subconscious is a lower form of consciousness than our own. The mind of our body is servant to the mind of our inner being. When we move our awareness inwards to the level of the superconscious, we can hear the voice of God. That is where we get divine inspiration and guidance. Intuition gets clearer and more powerful at this level. The superconscious is the universal mind. It has two aspects. The first aspect is that it is infinite intelligence that governs the whole universe. The second is that it is the collective consciousness of everyone and everything that exist in all levels of reality. The totality of all mind which is in existence. The superconscious is also the consciousness of our spirit which is a part of the first aspect. It operates at a highly increased rate where in a moment when our consciousness is shifted to that state, we perceive time slowing down and all our thoughts and decisions can happen in a split second that would have been impossible in normal rate of consciousness. When we move our awareness to the second aspect of the universal mind, we have a sense and realization that everything is connected and everything is one. In that state, we feel at one with the universe. There is no separation. At the level of the superconscious, we can also pick up thoughts and ideas coming from other people’s minds. This explains the phenomena of why when one hundred monkeys in one region of Earth learned to wash potatoes before eating them, all other monkeys in the world began to do the same thing too. The collective consciousness matrix of the mind also explains how psychics are able to locate missing persons or lost items in various places of the world. It explains why there have been cases where a family dog or cat will locate their owner even when separated by a move of thousands of miles. It explains why seventy percent of all dogs in California run away two weeks before an earthquake. The universal mind that is differentiated into our individual mind is what we call our consciousness and subconscious. Your mind has an autonomous intelligence . When you think of a thought, it sinks into the inner levels of your consciousness. Your consciousness automatically carries out that thought in your reality. You are the programmer and you are the program. You are the programmer within the program. You are the self-programming program."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"60 Our inner consciousness may be more powerful that our consciousness but that doesn’t mean it is better. If we do not move our awareness inwards, we cannot keep check of it. It will master us instead of we mastering it. Be master of mind, not mastered by mind . We can only move our awareness according to knowledge. It is knowledge that enable us to transverse all planes of the mind and reality. The ability to astral travel and have OBE (Out of Body Experience) comes from knowledge. The ability to see what is in the deepest parts of our psyche comes from knowledge. Knowing is seeing. All mind is consciousness. All mind is universal mind. All mind is one mind."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"61 Being a Creator of Reality - Position of Omnipotence I create reality. My reality is your reality. This is my reality and you are all my guests. You are here only because I chose you for a reason. I create my reality and everyone and everything in it. All interaction is for the purpose of experiencing ourselves. In you I get to see a part of myself, in me you get to see a part of yourself. Relating with me is a chance for you to discover yourself and relating with you is a chance for me to discover myself. We are all mirrors for one another. Everyone and everything you see in your world is a reflection of what goes on within. This is how we experience life. I, the Higher Self, the inner man creates reality. I disappear, I AM appears. The God entity, the Christ in me, the Holy Spirit. When you are one with the divine, it is the feeling of ultimate power. You are a co- creator with God of reality . God’s spirit and yours are one, there’s no differentiation and no separation. The main rule of conscious creation is: “ You create your own reality .” It is the only absolute rule, and what it means is that everything you have experienced in your life is your own creation, it also means that anything you wish to create in your life is never further away than your own fingertips. Find something you think of as beautiful. It can be a flower, the sunrise, whatever fills your heart with joy just to look at it or be with it. Now, while you’re observing it, tell yourself, “ I created this .” And pay attention to the feelings that come up as you say this. Other people say things are not their fault, that they are not the cause and are not responsible for it. Responsibility is power. Taking responsibility is taking control. When you take responsibility, you gain power . When you do not take responsibility, you are giving away your power to something or someone else. When you acknowledge that you create reality, all power is in your hands . You become responsible for everything that happens. There is nothing and no one to blame. It puts you in the position of omnipotence. Everyone has power over reality but you have the greatest power over your own reality. Others have power only according to the power you give them. When I am in your world, your world becomes my playground. Anyone that enters my world will be changed for the better or caused to disappear. This is my reality and there is an abundance of good in it. Everything changes for the better one way or another. Be in control of your impulses. Consciously decide which impulses to follow and which not to . Any impulses that you feel can come from various sources including psychic influence from others. Everything and everyone in your reality that gives you impulses are created by you to test and refine your own will and power of control. It is the most liberating feeling of all when you realize that you create reality . All of it and everything in it. It is most empowering. You are in a state of peace and freedom. Everything that happens in our entire lives no matter how long or short, are experiences that we choose to have. We choose them all with our higher selves. Nothing happens if you do not allow it to happen. All that you really want to happen will happen . There is no exception to that. Knowing that you are the complete creator of your reality and that you create it completely is the ultimate truth . Life is a movie, each one of us chooses to play a certain role in it. We also decide how things would play out. We are both the actor and the director. Luck, fate, destiny is all in your hands. This is my reality and I am the creator. This is my dream and I am the dreamer. This is my story and I am the star."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"62 We create reality at a general level and allow things to play out on a specific level . You can’t completely override the will of another person in his creation of his own reality. If someone is negative, you may have created that person to be negative. But that does not necessarily always have to be the case. You do not have to force that person to be positive. You simply create a reality where positive people exist in your life and not negative ones. You will then attract the positive people into your life. The negative ones will either change into being positive in some manner or their negativity will become less apparent. You just state what is your wish, your desire and your intention. And allow the universal mind to carry it out for you. Man makes plans in his heart, but it is the Lord who makes the path. State your request and allow God to bring it into your life. In whatever way it comes, it is the best. Allow it to happen freely without needing it to happen in a single way. Although you are a creator of your own reality and are responsible for everything that happens. You are responsible to cast that responsibility to God . Cast your care upon Him for He cares for you. To rest in God’s work is the main responsibility you have. When you trust God to handle things instead of striving to handle them yourself, you are placing your reality into the hands of omnipotence . It can be hardest to deal with things directly, but when you believe in God working it out for you, it becomes a lot easier. It is better to depend on God than to depend on self. You create your reality through your beliefs. So does everyone. Everything is individually purposed, there are no victims. There is nothing that happens which wasn’t the result of your thoughts whether current or sometime in the past . Mind controls everything. Your thoughts shape the reality matrix continuum. Changing your beliefs will not just change your perception of reality, but alters the reality you experience. Your beliefs form your reality. We choose from a sea of infinite probable events, since no event is “real” until we have actually chosen to experience it. Imagination is the faculty of belief. What you imagine is what you create in your mental world, which will then manifest over time in your physical world. Imagine a world where things are as good as you want them to be. Hold it in your mind, and things will start to happen that way . As impossible as “it” seems, I choose to believe “it” is possible. Because anything is possible. Even if the possibilities do not exist, they can be created . That is the magic key about reality. Reality can be created. Nothing is impossible. There is nothing you cannot be do or have. You can be, do and have anything you want. All things are possible when you believe."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"63 Shared Reality - Cooperative Mental Creation Your reality may be a mirror of your mind, but the reality you experience is not yours alone. It is a shared or cooperative reality that includes the mirrors of other people’s minds. In a cooperative reality, one person’s mirror will reflect onto another person’s mirror, to some degree . For example, the hate and friction you find in your reality of joy and love may be from someone else’s mirror, not yours. This cooperative interaction of each other’s mirrors helps keep you from falling into the trap of stagnation. If everything was a reflection of your mind alone, there would be no forces to create change and there wouldn’t be much causes for growth . Since reality is a shared one, you learn not only by your mistakes and merits, but by everyone else’s mistakes and merits. The physical universe is not only a mirror of your universe, but it is also a mirror of everybody else’s universes. Their universes reflect off from the physical universe with such a force and velocity that it is very hard for the creations from your own universe to get through the force emanating at your universe from the physical universe. The physical universe is neither your enemy, nor your competition. It is just a mirror reflecting the universes of all the other people who also want their way. Get the idea that your universe is like a castle that is under attack. The emanations coming from the physical universe are the attackers. Somehow, you must defend your castle and at the same time fashion your own missiles to send toward the physical universe. The secret here is not to agree with what is coming from the physical universe . Well, some might say, “Oh, that’s easy. I already disagree. I don’t like the government. I don’t like the war. I hate poverty, etc.” Well, my friend, this is not disagreeing. This is being disagreeable. This is actually completely agreeing with the physical universe and then complaining about it. Actually, disagree means to maintain the separateness of your universe from the physical universe . I guarantee you that, if you run your car into a tree it is going to get damaged. If you jump your body off a building, in the physical universe, it is going to get injured. Make sure you do all your disagreeing in your own universe which will enable you to disagree with the physical universe safely and make your hopes and dreams materialize faster than you ever thought possible. Create your dreams in your own universe and realize they are true there. Because physical reality is a cooperative reality and because your mirror can affect another person’s mirror, so can your thoughts affect another person’s fate . There will always be a discrepancy in your thoughts and your created reality . This discrepancy is caused by the impact of other people’s reality onto yours. Because other people’s thoughts and actions will affect your reality and you cannot fully control them, you have to trust God that He will work things out for you and everything will be under control of the greater one than you. You can tell the difference between your own reality creation and the discrepancy of other people’s reality creation in your reality mirror by observing which situations happen more of the time and which ones happen only some of the time. The ones that happen more of the time in accordance to your thoughts are situations that you create, the ones that happen some of the time that you believe are not in accordance to your thoughts are the discrepancies of other people’s reality creation. Total responsibility for your life means that everything in your life, simply because it is in your life, is your responsibility. In a literal sense the entire world is your creation . Anything you experience and don’t like, is up for you to heal . Whatever you experience, some part of you helped to create it. Because some part of you wanted it, maybe not the thing itself but something else that it gives you. To change it, you have to change you . If you want to cure anyone, you do it by healing you . You heal others by healing the part of you that created them. As you improve yourself, your improve your world."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"64 In giving a treatment, you talk to yourself about somebody else . A treatment begins and ends within the thought of the one giving it. The practitioner must do the whole work within himself . He must know the Truth, and as he does that, he sets in motion the Law of Mind. A thing which is known by any part of the Universal Mind is known by every part of It, for It is an Undivided Whole. When you know in one place, you know everywhere . When you give a treatment you do not send out a thought, you simply know it within you. When you know it within yourself, your thought operates in the subconscious of another, no matter where that person may be. There is no such thing as an absent treatment, as opposed to a present treatment . The mental connection is nonlocal. In mental treatment, the practitioner deals with thoughts and does not treat bodies or conditions. He never manipulates, nor need he lay his hands on his patients. He does not hypnotize them, he does not care where they are when he is treating them , or what they are doing, for this would be a limited concept. The practitioner’s work begins and ends within his own consciousness . We do not argue to make principle work but to convince our own thought that it already is operating. If you desire to help someone destroy some form of lack, limitation or error, the correct method is not to think of the person whom you wish to help. The intention to help them is entirely sufficient, as this puts you in mental touch with the person . Then drive out of your own mind any belief of lack, limitation , disease, danger, difficulty or whatever the trouble might be about the person’s situation. As soon as you have succeeded in doing this the result will have been accomplished, and the person will be free. If one wishes to treat a patient, he must first treat himself . As he treats himself, that is, as he treats his own mentality, he reaches the mentality of his patient. The practitioner cannot erase the thought in the patient’s mentality until he has first neutralized the idea in his own thought . The practitioner does not try to hold a thought or send out a thought, he simply tries to convince himself of the perfection of his patient . Never say “Here is a patient whom I must heal”. For, if you see him from this angle, how are you going to heal him? If you see a sick man he will remain sick, so far as you are concerned. You cannot heal while you see sickness. In treating, turn entirely away from the condition. Disease and limitation are neither person, place nor thing. They are simply images of thought. Turn entirely from the condition, or the limited situation, to its opposite, that is, to the realization of health, happiness or harmony. Let us suppose that Sarah is sick and Michael is a practitioner of mental science. She comes to him, saying, “I am sick.” He understands that Mind is all, but she does not understand this. She feels that she is sick. But he knows that all sickness is mental. He does not try to hold a thought over her, nor does he try to suggest anything to her , for that is not mental treatment. He simply declares the Truth about her . He speaks her name and says, “This word is for her. She is perfect, she is well .” In other words, he contradicts what appears to be and declares the Truth about her. What happens? A law is being enacted on the subconscious side of life. His word, operative through the Universal Sea of Mind (in which both live) sets in motion a law which manifest through her body as healing. Sarah thinks a miracle has been performed. She exclaims, “I am healed. I did not have a bit of faith, but Michael healed me”. No miracle has been performed. He used a law which all may use if they will. Suppose Sarah were perfectly well, but wanted a position, what would the treatment be? It would be the same. Michael would state in Mind what should be done for Sarah. There is only One Law, Mental Law. Law is Mind in Action . Sarah could demonstrate just as well for herself if she understood It, but she must first see It demonstrated to realize It . This is the state of mind of most people who come for healing. They do not know what ails them, they think their condition is due to some external cause. Nevertheless, they are healed and exclaim, “This is a marvelous thing, though I do not understand what it is all about”. Often they become superstitious about it, as people do about the things they do not understand. Once they understand the law, healing is no longer a mystery ."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"65 The method of realization is one whereby the practitioner realizes within himself the perfect state of another. It is purely a spiritual and meditative process of contemplating the Perfect Man , and if the embodiment of the idea is really made, it will at once produce a healing. Treatment is for the purpose of inducing an inner realization of perfection in the mentality of the practitioner, which inner realization, acting through Mind, operates in the person. Healing is not creating a perfect body or a perfect idea. It is revealing an idea which is already perfect. Healing is not a process, it is a revelation through the thought of the practitioner to the thought of the patient. There may be a process in healing but not a process of healing . The process in healing is the mental work and the time it takes the practitioner to convince himself of the perfectness of his patient and the length of time it takes the patient to realize this perfectness. If he could do it in one minute, she would be healed in one minute. Sarah must have a consciousness of health before the healing can be permanent . It will have to become a part of her subjective thought. If the consciousness did not change she would perpetuate the old thought images and would get sick again. That is why, in treating, people get well for a while and then become sick again. They are not permanently healed unless the consciousness is healed . When you treat, resolve things into thoughts. Bodies, people, objects and all things into thoughts. Having resolved everything into thoughts, know that disease is neither person, place nor thing. It has no location, does not belong to any one, cannot operate through any one, is not believed in by any one. Know that it is a false belief, a false image, with no power. Know that the whole thing is mental, then mentally dissolve it . Each treatment is a complete statement of the Reality of Being. The treatment should be repeated daily until a healing takes place. If it takes five minutes, five hours, five days or five years, the treatment must be kept up until a healing is accomplished . This is the only method that we know. It is not enough to say that everything is all right. This is true in principle, but in fact, it is only as true as we make it. Treat until you get results. A healing takes place when the patient is no longer sick, and until that time mental work must be done ."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"66 Change Reality by Creating it Anew You can’t create something and then try to make it into something else by manipulation . The more you resist, the more it persist. What’s done cannot be undone. It doesn’t matter! You just create again, and anew! When you create something wrongly, let it go and focus on creating what you want once again. The secret of changing reality is to create a new one . Your new creation will cancel out the old one. Creation vs. Control Anytime you do something in order to keep something else from happening, you are trying to shape reality to the exclusion of events. In order to exclude something from your life, you have to focus on what you are trying to exclude . Since you get what you focus on, trying to exclude something is not the way. When you use only biodegradable products, recycle and plant trees in order to stop environment from being destroyed, you are believing in a world where the environment is being destroyed. That mindset creates that reality in your life. Focus on what you want to create, and let go of anything that isn’t your intention. When some people pray, their problems seem to take care of themselves. Good prayer is focusing on the reality you intend to create and not on problems . The last thing you want to do is control reality, you want to create it! When you set out to write a story, or paint a picture, you might have an overall sense of what you want, but you don’t try to control the flow of the paintbrush, or the pen in your hand. You let the vision express itself as you stay in “the flow”, and then refine it until you are happy with it . Reality creation is the higher form of reality control. Control by creating . Perceiving vs. Judging We define judgment as saying this is good, this is bad. Perceiving is seeing something for what it really is. A couple had their van hit in the back by a pickup truck. This could be judged as a “bad” event. Who wants their automobile crunched and broken? The perspective of it being bad would automatically prevent them from seeing each event connected to it as anything more than a pain in the neck. They would have basically been blind to all of the little nuances and genuine feelings they were having towards each part of the sequence. In this case, they released their judgment about it and simply opened to knowing more about it . In the end, the guy who hit them actually helped to get their cargo home, which they were having trouble with in the first place. They got far more insurance money back than they actually paid for the van in the first place. The van was still quite usable, and they got to interact with some really great people as well! When you stop labeling something as good or bad, you can see it for what it is. You may know how you’re supposed to feel , but in finding out how you really feel , you’ll discover another layer of who you really are! Perceive what IS, is the higher form of judging. Judge by perceiving . Probable Selves and Probable Realities. When you think about probable selves like particles instead of a wave form, they are beings you create"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"67 that take on an existence of their own and are doing their own thing. You may interact with a probable self whenever you shift focus to it. When you look at probable selves as a wave form, it’s one continuum of consciousness. You simply create an event to experience and when you’re done, you create something else. Subject/Object, Wave/Particle, Observer/Observation, it is all us and not us. How truly flexible physical reality really is. It is not the hard and fast linear reality we first learned it to be. If we want to experience something in our reality, we can create it by putting our attention on it. But by focusing only on what you want, aren’t you just ignoring all the bad stuff that’s out there? If you look at anything from one side, you are automatically not focusing on the other side. If you look at a city and expect to see crime, you will align with that aspect and experience crime either directly or via the news or some other source. It’s not that the “bad stuff” doesn’t exist, the truth is that everything exists . However, you will experience whatever you choose to focus on. The more you choose joy and love, the more you will resonate with events that reflect these choices . The impact of opposite things such as crime will begin to disappear from your reality, becoming more and more distant until you don’t even hear about it anymore. The ultimate reality is a sea of infinite possibilities. Everything exist in that state. We attract into our own experience and reality according to that which we focus on. It doesn’t matter what exist. It only matters what you allow to exist in your reality. Your reality is the only reality you experience. You totally have the God given power to create your world . The beauty of infinite probabilities for the conscious creator is that it literally opens the door for magic to happen. Believing that there is an infinite range of experiences to choose from frees up your energy from any limitations you may have placed on it in the past. This is magic in its purest form, the ability to manifest something directly into your life. All you need to do is believe the probability that you have achieved that goal exists, and then feel yourself resonating with it and stepping into it. Up until now you have created your life in this manner, possibly while being unaware of the mechanics behind it. Now that you have an understanding of these mechanisms, the universe is completely your playground ."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"68 Watching Reality Shift Before Your Eyes Have you been amazed how many times situations change before you from time to time? Reality shifts from one moment to the next . It is not rigid but fluid. Whenever you find yourself in a situation that isn’t desirable to you, always remember that reality is in constant flux . Whatever that is happening at the moment in your experience is only temporal. What is true now doesn’t have to be true later. Have you seen the way children are? They spontaneously move from one moment to the next. They may be in a situation that makes them feel unhappy one moment but when the next situation comes along where it makes them feel happy, they just enter into it afresh without being held back by the previous situation . This is the power of being present and living in the now. It helps you to make every situation your first situation. It enables you to use all your mental resources fully and freely in the situation that you are currently in . Being conscious of how you make associations across situations empowers you to choose those associations in ways that are constructive for you. You can consciously decide when to link situations together and when to keep them separate instead of doing them unconsciously all the time even in ways that are not be helpful. When we experience one positive situation after another , it is better to mentally associate them with each other instead of keeping their meanings separate. This increases the joy we experience from each situation collectively as a whole. Sometimes we allow a negative situation that comes along after a positive one to diminish our joy that we experienced from the first one. Here is where it is useful to separate the positive and negative situations as independent from each other so that the later does not affect the first, thereby keeping the joy of the first experience shielded. However when we experience a positive situation after a negative one , we can allow ourselves to use the positive situation to make a positive association with the negative one. That takes away the negativity of the first situation and even transmute it into something positive. In the case where we experience one negative situation after another , we tend to link them together multiplying the effect of each one. It is important to realize that we don’t have to do that! We can isolate each situation from being independent from the other so as not to make each one worse than it already is. By reframing the way we think about a situation , we can stop giving power to it and start gaining power over it instead. Whenever you have just experienced a negative situation and it leaves you feeling negative for awhile, understand that it is ok. The first step to moving out of it is acceptance. It brings you to a state of peace and calm because you are not being judged and there’s nothing wrong with you. Then the next step is to start allowing a positive situation to open up before you. Allow yourself to think positively again and to do things that make you feel better . The principle of rhythm states that everything has its rise and fall, rest and flow, increase and decrease. Everything is swinging from one state to another from moment to moment. The amount of the swing to the left is the amount of the swing to the right. Rhythm compensates. The Law of Attraction states that negative emotions attract negative situations while, positive emotions attract positive situations into your reality. But understanding the principle of rhythm helps you to know that your emotions can change from one state to another from moment to moment. So don’t worry of"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"69 being stuck perpetually in one state because you will only be trapped if you allow yourself to. Therefore if you are experiencing a negative situation of a certain magnitude right now, realize that you will experience a positive situation of the same magnitude some time later. The swing to the left is the swing to the right. Having this awareness brings hope and joy to your heart. Although it is the nature of things to swing from one end to another, you can counter the swing by polarizing yourself on the end you wish to be on. By choosing to focus on experiencing the positive as much as possible, you will polarize your reality more of the time in the positive state. Of course the negative situations will still come in from time to time, but by being willing to shift your mind out of it as soon as you can, you allow yourself to ride the return swing to the positive side as soon as it happens . Every moment is a new beginning. This is eternally true. The sooner you realize this whenever you need to, the faster you become free of any situation you experienced. You might be in a situation where you want to do something but the opportunity is not there. Hold that thought in mind because whenever you have a desire to do something, there will always be an opportunity that opens up some time later for you to do it. It could even happen the very next moment. This is the nature of how reality operates. Ask and it shall be given. You ask by thinking about it. Every thought is an intention and every intention is a request to the universal mind to make something happen. God can read your thoughts even without you saying it. There is no desire that arises from within without there being the opportunity to fulfill it . Every dream can be realized. Always be ready to act when the situation opens up for you to do what you want to do . When you live with the expectation that if what isn’t happening for you now may happen for you later, you will watch reality shift before your very eyes ."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"70 Desires and Feelings are Directions from Spiritual Forces It is necessary that Spirit should manifest in SOME KIND OF FORM in order that It may come into Self- Expression through Self-Realization. It is necessary that Spirit be manifested in order to express Itself . Behind every manifestation must be the desire to create, the urge to express . This is called the “ Divine Urge “. It is the Cause that moves the energy. So dynamic is this Urge that it will cause a little seed to break open the most solid earth, in order that it may express itself in the form of a plant. It is the coming forth of Spirit into expression, the release of energy into action, and is apparent in all Creation. Behind every action of man is some form of desire to express . This desire, of course, is purely mental in its nature. All that man is, is his mentality, both conscious and subconscious, plus what he expresses. The Divine Urge is strong in man and constantly causes him to seek some form of self-expression. It is Divine because It is the desire of Spirit to express Itself through him , and like all the other forces of Nature, this energy can work through man only at his bidding whether consciously or unconsciously, for he is an individual and has self-choice. This Urge or Energy is called “ Libido ”, which means the emotional craving, or wish , behind all human activities. It is the repression of it which leads to psycho-neuroses. The energy set in motion through this urge is the dynamic power of Mind, and unless it becomes expressed, it will congest and cause a conflict within the mentality. Inhibited action produces conflicts and complexes which mentally tear and bind; and as they manifest their physical correspondents, they produce nervous disorders. It is claimed that a large percentage of diseases is caused by the suppression of some form of emotion. Some form of desire is back of everything a person does, some desire to express life . Any unexpressed desire will eventually lead to a complication. Things will stand just so much pressure and no more; when the limit is reached an explosion will follow, unless some avenue for expression is provided. If we were completely expressed we would never become sick or unhappy. The average person goes through life only partially expressed and always with a sense of incompletion and dissatisfaction. Emotion, uncontrolled, produces chaos; unexpressed it produces confusion, conflict and complication; for energy will have an outlet . When an emotion conflicts with the will and becomes suppressed it returns to its subjective state, but remains active; it will come up in some other form; it will not be put down. It may remain in a subjective state for years; but eventually, unless neutralized, it will manifest. Let one go for years with some unexpressed longing and he will have created such a desire that it will have become irresistible in its inclination toward expression. People often become seething cauldrons within because of inhibited action. Energy must find an outlet. Energy is energy and will be expressed or blow the top off , just as a pipe will stand only so much pressure before bursting. Millions are daily being blown up, mentally and physically, through the suppression of desires. Desire is a dynamic force and must be taken into account. The spirit leads you by desire. Desire is a feeling . When the spirit directs us, we would feel an inclination to take a certain action. We feel like doing something, we want to do it. We have a desire to do it. That desire is what is known as an inner prompt . Follow your inner prompts and you are following the spirit. It is certain that you can do what you want to do. The desire to do it is proof that you have within you the power which can do it. Desire is power seeking to manifest . Deep down inside you know you can do it, that’s why you want to do it. Every desire is possibility seeking expression through life . The desire to play music is the power which can play music seeking expression and development. The desire to speak before millions is the power which can inspire the world seeking expression and"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"71 development. The key is development. When there is no power, either developed or undeveloped to do a thing, there is never any desire to do that thing. Power is the ability to do or act . When there is strong desire to do a thing, it is certain proof that the power to do it is strong . The more unbreakable a desire is, the more unbreakable the power present is. Power comes from purpose. It is God that works in us both to will and to do . Desire is based on Purpose . In your strongest desires, you feel a definite sense of purpose which is undeniable within you. Purpose is what defines us and binds us to our design and destiny. Purpose is the Will of the Divine . Your innermost desires are divinely inspired . Your passions are God’s way of leading you . Every positive thought, idea an inspiration you have is a message from God. God is the universal mind who communicates through your mind . His message comes through your feelings, intuition and thoughts. God leads you from within . By choosing to follow your heart, you are fulfilling what God has placed in you. Our desires are the script given to our souls for us to execute here on earth , while our freewill gives us the choice to either follow our script or choose another one. We can choose whatever script we want, however following our own script may lead us to chaos, struggle, unnecessary challenges and pain, while following the script assigned to us by our souls leads us to happiness , joy, fulfillment, prosperity and wisdom. Everything is vibration and vibration is frequency. You experience frequency, energy or vibration by feeling . Emotion or feeling is the closest thing to frequency or vibration that we can communicate to the universe with. All communication takes place through the use of frequency . When God communicates a frequency to you, you experience it as a feeling or desire. Feeling is the experience of energy being moved . Emotions are the gateways and channels to thought waves of inspiration, creativity and ideas . How does an artist paint his picture? How does a musician create his song? How does a scientist discover his theory? He simply feels it out . Einstein discovered the theory of relativity by feeling the experience of riding on a beam of light. How did I create this piece of writing? I simply feel what I write and write what I feel. Desire and Feeling is the channel by which all spiritual forces direct you . It is the same channel by which God, devil, other minds, the sin nature, your conscience and your thoughts direct you. Desire is a feeling which is emotion and all emotion is energy in motion . It is energy which is being moved by the mind. You are energy and it is God and all other forces including yourself that moves you in the form of desires and feelings . The key then is to discern which spiritual force is directing you , and to choose which feelings you should follow and which ones you should overcome. You can only overcome a feeling generated by a spiritual force with a feeling generated by another spiritual force . Choose to connect more with the mind of God and you will experience his direction of your feelings stronger than any other spiritual forces."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"72 Knowing what to do - Following the Spirit The spirit knows the balance of rest and work that it needs . When you have worked too much, your spirit feels like not working anymore. It simply means you need to take more frequent rests. When you have rested too much, your spirit feels like doing things and involving in activity. The internal motivation system for rest and work follows the principle of rhythm. The measure of the swing to the left is the measure of the swing to right. There is a rhythm of rest and work . When you have worked for a certain amount, you will be compelled to rest a certain amount. When you have rested for a certain amount, you will be compelled to work for a certain amount. There is a force that you find very difficult to resist. It is spiritual force that follows the universal laws of nature . The best way to live your life is to just go with the flow. In everything we do, we need energy and energy comes from our spiritual being in connection with the energy of The Source . We are designed to function in harmony with the pattern of the universal mind. The universal mind always follows balance because it is balanced. Balance is symmetry and symmetry is perfection. The pattern of the universal mind is the flow of the spirit. The principle of rhythm is the principle of balance . People that take frequent rests are often the ones who are most productive at work. Everything has its ebb and flow. The waves of the ocean crashes onto shore and recedes back in a continuous fashion. There is a rhythm of effort and rest . There are moments to apply effort and moments to rest. When you apply, apply fully. When you rest, rest fully. Even when the time comes for you to rest and you do not, you will still rest in some way such as doodling, engaging in useless conversation, blanking out, making mistakes at work. Even when the time comes for you to work and you do not, you will still work in some way such as reading something just for novelty, getting yourself busy with unimportant tasks, doing something that makes you feel like you’re getting work done. One way or another, you cannot escape the force. If you cannot work, stop working and start resting. If you feel like working, stop resting and start working. Don’t waste the force. The spirit leads you by desire. Desire is a feeling . Your hunger leads you in what to eat, when to eat, how much to eat. God uses nature to direct you. Follow nature and you are obeying God. It works the same way for everything else. Desire leads you in what to do and when to do it . Play is also rest because play is a form of rest. It is always rest and recreation. Play is a time to recreate your mind. The line between work and play is blurred when you are doing something you enjoy. Your best work is doing that which you enjoy. Blur the line between work and play as much as you can. Mix business with pleasure at every opportunity . Learn to divide your focus. There are times when you still have to do something even if your mind has to handle multiple things at once. Allow your thoughts to jump around. Sometimes you’re meant to learn or experience several things at one time so you can have a varied range of experience. Conventional “focused work” can seem too tedious. You can do it in small bits and pieces and have fun while working, so that it doesn’t seem like work at all . You may work more productively on the long run that way because it is more relaxing and enjoyable. Follow the spirit, move as the spirit moves. The spirit always knows what is best for you to do at every moment. It communicates to you through a feeling or motivation. There are times when you are thinking of doing something, but you can’t really settle into doing it because your motivation and desire is in doing something else. You just feel like you’d rather be doing that thing instead. That is because your spirit knows that is the better thing for you to do at the moment . When you follow the spirit, you will do the right thing at the right time. Things can become smooth, flowing, easy and effortless."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"73 Your spirit knows the bigger picture, it has knowledge of the big plan. It knows how everything falls in place. It knows the best sequence of doing things. Perhaps what you are doing now can be replaced by something else, because you don’t really need it now and may be better for you to focus on at a later time instead. Your spirit is there to direct you. Listen to it and you will never go wrong. When we refer to the spirit, we are actually referfing to the higher mind. Your subconscious in connection with the superconscious, your higher mind in connection with the universal mind. It knows all things because it is in connection with the divine. How does the spirit lead you? By feelings and desires . Perceiving what the spirit is telling you is a sixth sensory perception. It is an inner feeling and inner knowing. A certain frequency or state that we feel. Frequency is how we speak to our spirit as well . When we think a statement of affirmation, it isn’t just the words that we use but also the strong feeling of it being so that counts. When the spirit directs us, we would feel an inclination to take a certain action. We feel like doing something, we want to do it. We have a desire to do it. That desire is what is known as an inner prompt . Follow your inner prompts and you are following the spirit. Sometimes the spirit communicates to you in the most subtle way that in the moment it could very well be ignored or acted upon . There is almost no force exerting itself upon you in either direction. You are in a very balanced position where you can tip yourself towards any direction. That shows that your spirit is giving you the choice of total free will with complete freedom of decision. When you look back after making the right decision, you would probably think that you almost might not have done what you did. It happened so freely as if by chance. The pace of the spirit is never too fast or in any bit hurried . That is why it is important to give yourself ample time in whatever you are doing. Do not prepare to leave at the last moment. Do not leave anything to the least amount of time needed left before you do it. Take your time, never hurry. Hurry is a manifestation of fear, he who fears not has plenty of time . Hurry and fear will instantly cut your connection with the universal mind. You will get no power, no wisdom and no information until you are calm. Fear turns strength into weakness. There is a difference between going fast and hurrying. The difference is the feeling you experience in each mode. Those who are wise about the pace of the spirit never seem hurried, they’re always cool and taking their time. Live in the present. Forget about time . Don’t allow the concept of time to deter you from Living. Flow from one moment to the next. Slow down and be patient. Go faster only when you have the energy or rhythm to do so. Don’t worry about what you need. God will always supply your need right at the moment when you actually need it . His time is on the dot according to his rule of waste not, want not. Even when you did not get what you originally sought to look out for, there will still be something else good in place that you’ll find . It’s still part of what you’re looking for. The actual original thing you sought for can still come later ."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"74 True Reality is Spirit and True Identity is Light Every negative situation you experience in life is a test to see if you can be moved from who you think you really are. If your sense of self can be changed so easily according to every difficulty, disappointment and failure that you face, then your identity isn’t so true after all. True identity is unchanging and becomes even stronger with each opposing circumstance that seeks to destroy it, because it is tied to true reality. Your true identity is light . The darkness cannot touch you because you are light. In the presence of darkness is where you are able to truly shine as light. Do not allow the darkness to cause you to forget your true identity as light, but to use it as a chance to reinforce who you really are. Rather than allowing the circumstances in the world to shift your sense of self, keep your eyes on true reality. True reality is spirit . Spirit is perfect, complete and whole. Spirit does not need anything to define what it is. It already has everything it wants and is everything it wants to be. Spirit can do anything that it desires to do. When you see from the position of spirit, you are seeing from the position of truth. Truth never changes and it is always the same no matter what appears to be. We cannot seek abundance because we are already abundance. We cannot seek health because we are already health. We cannot seek happiness because we are already happiness. You experience perfect health, abundant love, pure happiness and joy, infinite supply for you know that from wherever our abundance came from there is always an inexhaustible supply. You don’t do things to make you happy because you are already happiness. It is your natural state. The more you encounter negative circumstances, the more you should realize that this world is an illusion . It is all a test to see if you will become ensnared by the illusion of it being the reflection of your true identity. Circumstances that reflect your true identity will always be in alignment with spirit. Only acknowledge circumstances that are in alignment with spirit as a reflection of true reality. Life is a game for us to play out who we are. No matter what happens, it is still a game. When we are involved in a game, we could experience all the emotions that comes with it. We may be in the game but we do not belong to the game. We are who we are regardless of how the game goes. Before the game, during the game and after the game, everything is what it always is. You have nothing to lose and nothing to attain. As long as we know who we are while we are playing the game, we will run the game instead of letting the game run us. We are able to detach from whatever happens because it is just a game, and we are simply here to have fun experiencing whatever that unfolds. Everything is a gift that helps us evolve in the game to becoming who we already are outside of the game. We are already winners whether we play the game or not . The situations that we face in this world is for the purpose of severing our attachments to apparent reality, so that we may become more and more centered on the reality of spirit. The situations that we face in this world will always fluctuate from positive to negative and back, because it is an illusion . Just when we think we can keep things positive, they change to negative again. Just when we think things will stay negative, they change to positive. Once we realize that we cannot keep things in apparent reality going only one way or another, we wake up from the illusion of control over it. When we no longer need to control it, it no longer controls us. We are no longer swayed by the ebb and flow of apparent reality . What we own, owns us. So instead of try to own apparent reality and letting it own us, we can own true reality instead and be owned by it. Abide in God and God will abide in you. Transcend the illusion of apparent reality by keeping your mind on true reality and you will have peace that is unshakable . You can be happy and grateful because God has already made you everything you"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"75 want to be, and has giving you everything you want to have.
