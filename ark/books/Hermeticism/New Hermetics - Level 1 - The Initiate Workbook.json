"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"In order to become a New Hermeticist, it is necessary to adopt several new models of behavior. These will help you to fully actualize your powers in the most helpful and positive possible way. You are about to go into uncharted territory, and without these guideposts, it would be easy to become lost in the morass of your own fears, illusions and bad hab its. We are all limited beings, and even our most profound insights are limited by our human imperfections. The basic guideposts of the New Hermeticist are simple . It is necessary to cu ltivate a natural, cheerful skepticism, a sense of possibility, knowledge that trut h is entirely subjective, an awareness and cultivation of the basic mystical states, and an endless pursuit of equilibrium. By moving consciousness through speci fic processes, certain results alwa ys follow. Because each person is unique, the specific content of experiences may be different, but the process can be predictable and constant. I've discovered that there are specific tools for directing subjective thought, which cause predictable changes in consciousness and cause changes in the way we view ourselves. Throughout the New Hermetics Program, you will experience out of body states, communion with gods and other nonhuman intelligence, and produce the experience of enlightenment and ecstasy, simply by understanding that all experience is subjective. You see, in life, even when you are “just pretending ,” you are still experiencing anything that you pretend on a subjective level. To most of your brain, things that you pretend are “reality .” This is because your brain does not differentiate between inner and outer experience. If you imagine yourself licking a lemon for long enough, your salivary glands w ill start to produce saliva. You will soon begin to pucker your lips and salivate. By consciously directing your thoughts, your unconscious responds. Your brain does not differentiate between thoughts and things, because thoughts are things. The universe is mental. On an experiential level, the more you pretend, the more real your experiences become in your mind, and the more unexplainable the practical results you will get in your exterior life. If we change things in our minds, this eventually changes things in the outer world, because it is all one thing in the end. * The Initiate level of the New Hermetics is a set of tools based upon the physical plane of reality, the world of the elements (the sephirah Malkuth in Qabala), and the gateway to the Astral world, your own imagination and subconscious (the path of the Hebrew letter ; [tau] ). The programs in this level will introduce you to the basics of exploring your inner wo rld. With these programs you will begin to look within yourself and to balance the elements of your personality. You will improve your ability to visualize and your ability to understand and manage your internal and your external world. The focus in this level is the development of a foundation in the physical world, the actions necessary to develop your inner power, the reframing of the pain/pleasure principle, and the balancing of the four elements in the personality so that you have the greatest power of choice over your actio ns. You will be introduced to the Æthyr, or astral plane, through visualization, astral projection and communicating with your inner teacher, or inner sage. These patterns are about gettin g the mind used to looking inward. They will teach you to enter the altered state of consciousness, and how to work in that state. The programs in this level: 1. The Power of Goals 2. Power Visualization in the Æthyr 3. New Hermetics Grounding and Centering 4. The Four Elements 5. Balancing the Elements 6. The Power of Earth: Pain into Pleasure 7. Astral Traveling 8. Meeting with Your Inner Teacher Each of these programs is a techno logy designed to move your mind in specific directions. Find a quiet place to sit or lie down where you will be comforta ble and able to devote your full attention to the programs. Each program is about a half hour. DO NOT listen to these programs while you are engaged in other activities, particularly driving or working on anything that requires your full concentration. You"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"should always have this workbook nearby so that you can complete the written work immediately at the end of each program. This work is usually fairly small and can be completed in less than five additional minutes. Please fill out the workbook as you proceed, co mpleting each section in order to the best of your abilities. You may skip around to a certain degree, but try to keep relatively in order. Session 1 - Your Initiation into New Hermetics Please listen to the program Initiation into the New Hermetics. This is your New Hermetics initiation. You will begin by setting up your inner temple in the altered state and then you will move into darkness. From there you will be introduced progressively to the light. You will be asked to visualize several things in this program. Do not worry if your visualization skills are imperfect. Merely attempt to visualize and follow along vividly in your mind. The most important thing is to be relaxed and receptive. Seeing things vividly is totally unnecessary. Merely “pretending” to see will be equally effective. Date and Time You Listened to This Program ______________________________________________ Please describe your experience: ______________________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________________ Were you able to have a significant experience of the Light?_____________ If no, please listen to the program again , allowing yourself to become mo re relaxed and receptive. If you are having trouble letting go, you may wish to listen to this tape in the evening, just before bed. In this case you may want to listen to it sitting in a comfortable chai r so that you’re less likely to drift off into sleep. How did the Light affect you? ______________________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________________ Session 2 – The Power of Goals Please listen to this program now The Power of Goals , and then complete the exercise below. Date and Time You Listened to This Program ______________________________________________ The New Hermetics separates goals into 5 categories, corresponding with the four elements, and the fifth element of Aethyr or Spirit. These five categories can be separated roughly as folows: AETHYR- Spiritual goals, your life's work FIRE- Goals for your your Will, Personal power, desires, creativity and sexuality WATER- Emotional goals, feelings and relationships AIR- Intellectual goals, goals about your ability to communicate EARTH- Financial goals, physical appearance Please immediately set four goals in each of these areas. Set the goal in the positive future tense for now, beginning each statement with, \"I will...\" As you set go als, please think about what you really want. Please list the goals that will really make you happy and fulfille d. Make sure that your goals are so exciting that you will want to do everything in your power to make them happen. If you set goals that you don't care about, you won't be helping yourself at all. You may always change your goals whenever you want, so just write down what's important to you at the moment. As you grow in all areas of your life your goals will change and grow as well. You will review your goals of ten, so you will constantly have the opportunity to change and improve them. Please leave the short lines on the right side of the page blank for the moment.

Please take a moment to chunk down your goals into several increments or steps. What will the intervening phases between now and the complete accomplishment of your goals be like. In other words, if your goal is to beco me president of a large corporation you might chunk it down something like this: learn about corporate America, get a job at corporation, get MBA, move into executive position, perform amazingly in position, innovate company, take over.

It doesn't have to be a big thing. If you want to learn Japanese, you could get a book or look into a continuing education class. If you want to buy a corvette, you could send away for a brochure. Don't worry about whether these goals are financially or emotionally out of reach for now. Simply begin th e process, and you will disc over the way to accomplish your goals as you progress in the New Hermetics. Please write below something you can do to begin the process of accomplishing your top five goals. 1. _____________________________________________________ 2. _____________________________________________________ 3. _____________________________________________________ 4. _____________________________________________________ 5. _____________________________________________________ Within the next week, please be sure to do these five small things. You will set in motion massive forces in the universe. Now, choose your number one goal for now, the thing that is absolutely most pressing for you to accomplish. If it is a big goal, th en write down the very first si mple part or chunk of it. 1. _____________________________________________________ Please make sure that you accomplish this in the next two weeks. This will really begin to move the forces necessary to accomplish all of your goals. Throughout the New Hermetics, you will return again and again to your goals, and you will make changes in yourself and the world around you with the practices of the New Hermetics that will make it possible to accomplish anything you can dream of. This simple exercise has changed your entire destiny. Session 3 - Action, the Gateway to Transformation There are several actions you can take in your day-to-day life that will help you immeasurably to awaken to your own spiritual power and wisdom. These actions are based on things that you do anyway, but by becoming conscious of them and imbuing them with po wer, they can immediatel y increase your personal power and connection to the universe. There are five different related actio ns. They are very easy to accomp lish, and will only take you a few seconds to perform. Conscious Eating With this tool you become conscious of what you are eating, increasing your awareness of the immense power in your food. You will then imbue this powerful f ood with specific intention so that it fortifies you in whatever way you can conceive. The three following tools will follow similar procedures with water and breathing. 1. As you sit down to eat a meal, observe the food th at is in front of you. Be present with the food and really look at it. 2. Think to yourself about all that has gone into bri nging this food to your table- the work of all the people that cultivated, packag ed, transported and provided this food for you. Even more importantly, think for a moment about the energy from the nutrients in the soil, the sunlight, oxygen and water that worked together to produce the food, and also the hands that prepared the food, whether yours or someone else's. 3. As you contemplate this, become aware of all the potential power that you will receive when you eat this food. This is a tremendous gift of power from the universe. 4. Now that you are becoming fully aware of the potential power that is in your food, you may consciously decide how you would like this power to be used. With the simple use of your mind,"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"You may charge your food with the task of increasing your vitality, energy, ability to communicate, losing weight, overcoming anxiety, grief or anger, or any other change or empowerment that you can conceive of and desire for your body/mind. 5. Hold your dominant hand over your food momentar ily, and act as if you have the ability to direct the energy of your food. You may make a picture in your mind of a glow or flow of energy, picture a desired outcome, sense a feeling that the energy is moving in the direction you have conceived, just simply tell it to do so verbally in your mind, or some combination. The only important criterion is that you make it as real for you as possible. Create for yourself what it would be like if you had this quality. Imagine what you would see, how you would stand and feel, what you would be saying to yourself. 6. As you eat your food, feel that this transformational energy is flowing into your body and beginning to fill you. 7. When you have completed your meal, thank the universe for the powerful energy that you have received. Conscious Drinking of Water 1. When you are about to drink a glass of water, become aware of the nature of water, which is cleansing and purifying. Imagine that this water has the magnetic power to remove toxicity and the negative energy from both the body and the environment. 2. Imagine that the water is going to purify your body both physically and spiritually as you drink it. Imagine what it would be like if you were purifie d. Imagine what you would SEE, how you would stand and FEEL, what you might be SAYING to yourself. 3. As you begin to drink the water, FEEL it flowing through you, drawing toxicity away from you, to remove it from your body as it passes through. 4. When you have finished your glass of wa ter, thank the universe for this cleansing. Conscious Bathing Just as water cleanses your insides when you drink it, it draws toxins away from the outside when you bathe. You may want to bathe in cool water, because it is said that the purifying effect of water is reduced when it is hot. 1. As you prepare to bathe, whether showering, taking a bath, or simply washing, become conscious of the purifying power of water. 2. Imagine the water is going to purify you as you bathe. Imagine what it would be like if you were purified. Imagine what you would SEE, how you would stand and FEEL, what you would be SAYING to yourself. 3. As you feel the water running over your skin, imagine all of your physical and spiritual toxins draining away. 4. VISUALIZE, FEEL, or DESCRIBE to yourself ve rbally (or some combination) that toxins are flowing away from you throughout your cleansing. 5. As you dry yourself off, thank the universe for cleansing you so fully. Conscious Breathing Breathing is one of our greatest sources of energy and power, but most of us do not even breathe effectively, let alone consciously. By breathing intentionally and deeply, you can quickly give yourself the gift of vitality, energy, tranquility and any other qualities that you desire. In later tools you will learn specific, powerful breathing techniques, but for now you will simply learn to breathe with intention, filling your body with power by carrying it on the breath. 1. Become aware of your breathing. FEEL it. 2. Breathe slowly and deeply down into your belly, completely filling your lungs. Allow your stomach to expand with your breath. 3. VISUALIZE that the air around you is filled with potentiality for some desired quality that you would like to manifest in your life. For instance, you could imagine that the air is filled with vitality, courage, strength, intelligence, patience or whatever you are most in need of at the time."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"VISUALIZE, FEEL, or DESCRIBE to yourself what it would be like if you had this quality. Imagine what you would SEE, how you would stand and FEEL, what you would be SAYING to yourself. 4. With each breath you breathe in, FEEL this ener gy entering your lungs and going out into your body through your bloodstream. 5. As you breathe out, FEEL that the energy is staying behind. Only the breath is going out. 6. Breathe about ten to twenty breaths, VISUAL IZING and FEELING this desired energy filling your whole body. 7. Thank the universe for the gift of this energy. Pore Breathing This tool expands upon the previous tool for conscious breathing, enhancing your breathing through the use of the altered state to enable you to experience all your pores in breathing. This will enhance your ability to draw in transformative qualities through your breathing. 1. Breathe slowly and deeply. 2. FEEL the SENSATIONS on the surface of your skin, as it covers your whole body. 3. VISUALIZE the pores of your skin opening, FEELING tingles all over your skin. 4. As you breathe in, VISUALIZE and FEEL the air entering into all of your pores, as well as your lungs, and leaving out your pores as you breathe out. 5. Now, VISUALIZE that the air around your b ody is filled with some desired quality (vitality, healing energy, elemental energy, etc.) You may also FEEL, HEAR or even SMELL this quality. 6. As you breathe in, FEEL your whole body filling with this quality through all of your pores. 7. As you breathe out, hold onto the quality inside of you, just letting go of the air. 8. Breathe in nine or so more times, filling yourself, charging up like a battery. 9. Continue to breathe normally, FEELING the built up energy inside of you. 10. Return to normal consciousness. You may increase the number of breaths to intensify th e experience. If you want to release the energy, just let it go while exhaling with the same number of breaths as you breathed it in. Later on, you will learn to use this energy accumulation in other ways, such as creating artificial elementals, charging spaces or healing. You may use these tools as often as you like. The more often you use them, the more quickly you will grow as a human being and a New Hermeticist. You may want to concentrate on specific qualities and energies that will help you to accomplish the goals you have set for yourself. Concentrating on the same energy repeatedly will help you to manifest it very quickly. Please dedicate your next three meals to conscious eating and drinking water. As you go through the next day, please set aside a few moments for conscious breathing and bathing as well.

The next time you listen to this program you may want to try out this order of preference, and adjust it as necessary. Also, you may want to try experimenting with eye accessing, moving your eyes up to the right when visualizing, right and to the side when hearing, and down to the left when feeling. Again however, each of us is wired differently, so you may have to adjust these directions to make the best use of this. You will practice with this program two more times in this workbook but you may use it as much as you'd like until you are capable of imagining objects very vividly.

In medieval times, these character traits were called the four humors: the Phlegmatic, the Sanguine, the Melancholic and the Choleric. Even though modern psychology has abandoned this simple model, we all do still possess these character elements within ourselves. In the ne xt two programs you will begin to become acquainted with these four elements and to understand how they shape your personality.

In order to succeed in the New Hermetics it is necessary to bala nce your personality so that you are capable of expressing all of the pos itive traits of each element and are not ob sessed by any of the negative ones. In the following charts you can see personality traits applie d to the four elements. Please take a look at these charts and begin to see where your imbalances are.
