Nature has a way of concealing and revealing. She tells half her story out in the sunshine in a loud voice, and the other half in whispers underground. She is coy like a coquette, and stern like a judge. She excites curiosity in the student, and dread in the debauchee. She holds the man of science to her breast, but is dumb to the lover of pleasure. She scorns the victim of priestcraft and repudiates the supernatural. The Sage takes his cue from his mother; like Nature, he conceals and reveals.

In reading this book please notice how the essays vary in style ; some of them falling into a weird rhapsody, others laconic and plain The Mystic will understand the reason of the difference, while another will peruse only the words. The barbaric splendor of Nature reveals truth and law as surely as does her terrible logic. She speaks in poetry and in prose. Facts are rarely ever naked, but often not only draped but masked. The occult eye sees straight to the heart of a fact, while the normal lens dwells on the habiliments.

We will present the subject of faith in a secondary aspect, and show you how to make out of it a mighty lever towards accomplishing results. We advise you to be alert, and in a certain sense skep tical in all save the principle upon which you found your premise. Take as a starting point yourself, for it is not necessary to travel far from home in order to find a subject on which to work. Believing in your existence, a priori, and resting upon the fundamental consciousness of the Ego, suppose you branch out into a series of unusual experiments as to what the possibilities of that Ego are. Most people find certain dominant tend encies uppermost, and are entirely satisfied to develop and live by them, never striving"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"14 SOME PHILOSOPHY to discover hidden mines within themselves along lines where they have not taken the trouble to penetrate. If you see a leaf floating on the wave at sea, you have some reason to think that land is near. May it not be possible that some indication as small as a leaf, floats round on the sea of your being, and you have failed to draw any conclusion from it. The mariner discovers the bit of green, and makes for the shore ; you discover the sign of unseen things and sail out into deeper waters. The lesson we would teach is this, observe the signs, no matter how insignificant ; let them create in you a sort of conditional faith ; follow them up and see what you will discover. The scientist is well used to this condi tional faith ; it is not absolute faith, but a suspension of judgment, an abandonment of prejudice, and a simple research based upon indications. When the miner strikes a sign of color, a certain faith is developed in him; it is conditional of course ; it is based on"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"OF THE HERMETICS 15 possibility, not on probability. It is quite a different thing from a man s faith in gravi tation or repulsion. It is what might be called a blind faith ; and the only excuse for its being is that in time, it will develop into a certainty or fall through altogether, in other words prove itself. Suppose for instance, you find at some one time, that you have seen clairvoyantly, treat that as the leaf on the sea of your being ; follow it up, and be not astonished if you land on the shore of an unknown country. Your faith which was suf ficient to lead you to explore, has brought you a certainty which translates itself into an added power. The reason that we insist on a conditional faith such as the scientist has, is this; if you blindly follow signs, so swallowed up in your belief that you are incapacitated to reason, or to think, or to bear disappoint ment, you will become fanatical, and lose your discrimination and power of judgment. There is a faith that is prepared for either success or failure ; it is a kind of half"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"16 SOME PHILOSOPHY belief in a thing, still strong enough to lead one to honest, unbiased investigation about it. It is the proper faith for one who inves tigates spiritualistic, psychic and sleight-of- hand phenomena ; a watchful, fair, consider ate faith which weighs the pros and cons in an investigation, and allows no undue influ ence to be brought to bear either for or against the result sought. This is strictly the scientific faith, and it is the first essential in the mind of the student of Philosophy. It should be laid down as an axiom by all beginners in the pursuit of knowledge, that our desiring or not desiring a thing to be, cuts no figure in the investigation. Truth does not arrange herself to suit us, but forces us to conform to her. If we enter the study of Philosophy with certain fixed ideas of what we would like to have, and of how we wish the Universe to be conducted, we are pretty apt to abandon the pursuit when we come to find out that Truth does not cut her clothes after a pattern of our own designing. Truth is safe enough"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"OF THE HERMETICS 17 and we can not improve upon her. It is our business to pursue her, and catch and hold some aspect of her if possible, otherwise we had better return to our delusions. To find Truth we must use the scientific method, which is always founded upon a temporary faith ; a premise assumed for the time being, as a test of the possibility of the solution of the problem. This is not the supreme faith which is founded upon the principle of being, and must be the rock upon which we build up any lasting struc ture. It is the shifting faith which can be abandoned, as we find the object upon which it is fixed useful or not ; but we do insist that when you start out to explore yourself, and to discover the latent possibilities within you, that you do as Columbus did, who hoped to find a new Continent, which up to the day when the first sign of land appeared, was to him and the whole of Europe an image and a dream."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"i8 SOME PHILOSOPHY CONCENTRATION. We urged you in the last talk to go on a voyage of discovery in yourself, and see if some waking potentiality was awaiting development. In this paper we desire to insist on the use of concentration to this effect. You who think you know how to concen trate, will find on attempt at a sustained effort how difficult it is, and how weak you are. Look back and see how many things you have begun, how many good resolutions you have made, and how much you have attempted and failed to complete. Youth climbs up the ladder of his own hopes and scans the prospect ; he expects to do every thing, to conquer every thing; he levels mountains of opposition in his own mind. He figures on becoming king"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"OF THE HERMETICS 19 of opportunity and creating it at his own bidding. Notice him ten years later sitting at the foot of the ladder of his dreams. He has spent his summers and his winters, his springs and his autumns in dabbling. First an attempt at this and then at that, tasting here and there of everything and nourished by nothing. He starts down a road to view an object, and slips off into a byway to view something else. He gets to singing a new tune and forgets the first stanza of the old one. He knows people and forgets their names, or he knows their names and forgets their faces. He is forever experimenting and never finishing ; he rests half way up the moun tain and a positive climax is something that he knows nothing about. Look over your life and see what you have done. You have dipped into books, but they never dipped into you. You have studied human nature and been cheated a hundred times. You have kissed a friend, and then another without reading the heart of the first. You came to the realm of"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"20 SOME PHILOSOPHY Philosophy, and wandered aronnd in a maze; you plucked a leaf and threw it away ; you inhaled the perfume of a flower and passed on; you gathered a bouquet and tossed it into the stream ; you dabbled your feet in the water, and washed your face in the dew ; and then, you entered the front door of a church and passed out at the rear. You tickled the wings of cupid, and he flew away, and sitting down on a grave you sighed ; and the next week, you danced. Such your life. Now you come to our doors and knock ; and we say to you, from behind the lock, &quot;Can you look at the point of a pin and look and look. Can you rest on a premise, and think and think up to the conclusion can you pile up facts on facts to the pinnacle of a principle can you study on one line to the very end of the question can you act on your conclu sion as against the world can you resist straying to the right and left when you have started towards a place or condition can you keep on aiming with the same stone at the same spot till you hit it can you stay"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"OF THE HER ME TICS 21 fixed in any pursuit any length of time, or are you a child?&quot; Start out with yourself and follow the leaf on the wave of your sea; follow follow concentrate and follow, by the blind faith of science, some sign in yourself till its value be disclosed. Be like the dog that gives chase, and is bound to be in at the death or the capture. We tell you now, at the very inception of the study ot Philosophy, that you must have two kinds of faith; one absolute, the other secondary and changeable; also concentra tion; without these it is useless to go on. To cultivate concentration you must prac tice. Cultivate that bull-dog tenacity to hold on to a thing till you know what it is, if you have once decided to grapple with it. Look into yourself and see if your past indicates concentration ; if not, begin."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"22 SOME PHILOSOPHY PRACTICE. There is something truly pathetic in the lives of those who preach and do not practice; who revel in the generalities of Philosophy as a sort of intellectual tonic, and are at the same time too lazy to try the formulas and hold fast to that which is good. I desire you to avoid a method of prac tice that is backed by habit. To take stated times to become good (say Sundays), is not at all after the manner of our system; and if you continually pursue this means, you will grow as fixed as a rock crystal. Life is your business, all kinds of life; rustling among men, eating drinking sleeping just as Christ did; and the best time for you to practice, is all the time. I who give you these instructions, know what life is from its pleasures to its agonies;"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"OF THE HERMETICS 23 from its feasts to its graveyards ; and the more of a Philosopher I am, the more do I know of its fulness. So when I tell you to practice, I mean that you are to stay where you are and practice. The great need of the world is the living Philosopher. Cloisters are out of date. Monasteries are old fashioned ; they belong to the middle ages. People must clash with each other in order to live ; must feel each other s pulse, and jostle shoulder to shoulder ; they must mingle magnetism, I might say, and give and take. In this rush, this hurry, is the time to try your cult and test its value. If you hide a diamond in a box, it loses all its power to be saucy and throw back the sun s rays to the sun; in fact it forgets after a while that it is a diamond at all, and be comes as sullen as a cold pebble. If you have anything good, you must find it out; and you never can do that by shutting your self up in an occult room and imagining. Do not mistake us; we told you to con centrate, and contemplate the point of a pin,"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"24 SOME PHILOSOPHY but not forever. While a certain amount of daily retirement into &quot;your closet&quot; is good, just as rest is necessary after exercise, too much of it is bad. Learn to concentrate and act too; this is practice of the best kind. Have a purpose, a means, a way, and ACT on it. Having a theory and getting no fact out of it, is like having a friend who will never embrace you. Concentration and action should go to gether. To be sure, you should reverse and retire into yourself when the occasion de mands, but never periodically and to order. Learn to do it when you have need of it (and you can tell that) but do not do it because you have arranged to. We preach practice from morning until night; all the time, everywhere. Your Philosophy should stick to you closer than the hairs of your head, and should put in an appearance on every occasion. If it is good for great things, it is good for little things. This does not mean that you are to be like the self-conscious Christian who can never get rid of his sense of responsibility; on the"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"OF THE HE K ME TICS 25 contrary, it assures you the best that there is in life. It shows you how to extract the most honey from the flower, the grestest beauty from the landscape, and the truest love out of a fellow mortal. It is also a sort of accident policy, it bestows on you a weekly allowance in case of something unfortunate and unforeseen; and if you die, it pays up to the last penny those whom you have left behind. It is practical, practical, practical, and if what you are getting is not, you hav nt the right thing. Practice at all times, and when ever you fail in making the application, you are that far short of grasping the situation."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"26 SOME PHILOSOPHY MEMORY. When you go down into the shadowy place where the sun s rays can not come, you are reconciled to the gloom because you remember. What is it that you remember ? That the sun still shines. You know very well that not a ray can penetrate where you are; that as far as you are concerned, for the time being, the Giver of Life the Con soler the Sun might as well be put out. It is a dark place gloom gloom gloom every where, and along with the gloom, dampness and chill. But what of it your memory serves you well you recall the splendor outside the half hour ago when you basked in heat and color all the tints that the sun brings out all the brilliancy and instead of a realization, you substi tute a memory."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"OF THE HERMETICS In your pursuit of Philosophy, understand that your path will not be all sunshine. Philosophy does not undertake to supply glory and glitter, nor does it guarantee you a freedom from shadows and tears. Philo sophy does not undertake to change nature; it gives you no seven-leagued boots with which to stride over the land no sandals like those of Pallas Athene, nor wings of a Mercury. Philosophy lets Dame Nature alone so far as changing her is concerned ; in fact she is very self-willed and like all feminine things, has her own way ; but here is a secret Philosophy deals with nature somewhat as a good husband does with a stubborn spouse ; Philosophy manages nature through her own attributes. A natural attribute by the way, is memory. Philosophy knowing this, brings it to bear at the right time, and reaps the reward. Philosophy has much tact, just as a wise husband has. To use art in remembering, is an essen tial towards Philosophic life. To be a good forgetter, is as necessary as to be a good"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"28 SOME PHILOSOPHY recaller. There is nothing more uncomfort able and out of place, than to have some thing that you have put under the sod, protrude its head at the wrong time. When you bury, bury deep, and do not dig up the thing unless you want it. Some memories are bores, just like some people ; they stay and stay out of pure viciousness, and the more you curse them the more staying power they show. A Philosopher will never allow this ; he knows that he can get rid of one memory by sub stituting another, just as you would shove an impertinent person out of a chair and put, another in his place. As you c&nforget by a sort of substitution, you can remem ber by a mental suggestion. When down in the shadow, recall some thing a star, a diamond, or a friend s eyes ; and see how quickly the place will glow as if a sun had been born, with dropped lids it is the same. There is a flash and a shimmer in the fire of memory which radiates in the now, if you desire it."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"OF THE HER ME TICS 29 Let us carry this lesson farther. Physi cal darkness is but one phase ; there is a mental and a spiritual blackness which tongue can not speak of, nor pen portray. Even in this dungeon of dungeons memory can send a straight ray, and turn black to white, night to day. When you recall the sun, at the time shadows enshroud you, with that recollection comes the conscious ness that the sun is a fixed fact that it ex ists, and that shadows can not extinguish it ; this makes you safe ; safe in your mind, safe in your heart ; you wrap the mantle of darkness about you, and laugh in the face of the night for the sun IS. You have remembered. When any trouble gloom mood, en folds you in a cloud, remember that the sun is, and the rays are warm, love warm, and they shine somewhere even in your recollection, and with the remembering will come a flash like that of Jupiter on Olympus like that of a friend s eyes and black will turn to white and night to day."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"30 SOME PHILOSOPHY This is the office of memory. Memory is your servant, if you can only realize it, memory is your slave, and all slaves impose upon their masters when allowed.

To imagine something is to call up an image in the mind by the will. This is vol untary imagination. Involuntary imagina tion (which is a bad thing always) is that state where the image or images come of their own accord, oftentimes as unwelcome, vulgar or wicked guests. Most lewd, vile, uncanny people are tools of the imagination. Images which seem to be like conscious entities, persist in dwelling in, and dominating the untrained tenant of an abused brain, and do incalculable mischief to him and those with whom he associates. Imagination is man s greatest friend and his greatest enemy; if you control him he will serve you; and no artist can paint pic tures as beautiful as his. Command him to"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"32 SOME PHILOSOPHY sketch the sea, the sky, the stars, the unseen and seen wonders of earth and heaven, and he will produce instantaneous results. He will decorate your castle for you and place you in it; he will create an interior environ ment that will so overpower your soul that crude outer surroundings will cease to trouble you. Imagination controlled by the will, is the one thing to be desired. On the other hand, involuntary imagination, that creature which like a snake slips into your sanctuary in the dark and conceals itself to coil and sting when you are totally unable to combat it, is to be abhorred and dreaded. Not that he is forever ugly the serpent has an unrivaled grace, and is a marvel in color not that, but he is unreliable, treacherous and poison ous; he may not sting, but if he does the antidote is hard to find. Worse than that, he is eternally reproducing himself; he brings forth a brood, or rather like the worm, the more you divide him the more alive he becomes; each piece of him in its turn ma turing and producing."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"OF THE HER ME TICS 33 He turns your mind into a nest, and wal lows in it as the swine wallow in the sty. He loves luxury and splendor as does the har lot; and his beauty, when it glitters has all the fascination of a lewd woman. The true sage controls his imagination somewhat as he does his memory, putting it out as he would extinguish a lamp, or light ing it as he would kindle a fire. The true sage can build himself an air castle that floats in a cloud, and frescoe it with the pic- - tures of angels. He can conjure forms of grandeur that outrival nature s own work; and create storms, the thunders of which will drown the voice of Jupiter. He can tint the rose and perfume the lily; still further, he can create the NEW, and build palaces that no architect before him has conceived, and design landscapes that as yet, are strangers to the brush. The sage but wills and his servant, the imagination, does. On the contrary, he who is unwise, is the coward lackey of his Master Imagination.&quot;^ He grovels at his feet, and hides his head, and stops his ears against the horrors thrust"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"34 SOME PHILOSOPHY upon him. He fears the dark, and dreads being alone. He is tortured about his health, and magnifies every twinge of pain into the death agony. All symptoms are to him as fatal ; he sleeps in his own coffin every night, and is resurrected from the grave every morning. His dreams are all warnings and prognosticate some future weal or woe. His animal instincts run riot, while he is 4 fettered and bound; his progeny haunt him like bad children, and lean on him for sup port. The air is peopled with his loathe- some offspring, and they follow him where- ever he goes. This fate is inevitable to him who allows his imagination to go rampant. In time, his will falls to sleep and he becomes like one in fever the prey to uncanny dreams or like the brandy-soaked victim who is ever terrified at the reptiles which his diseased fancy brings forth.

To have"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"OF THE HER ME TICS 35 your imagination run with you, is to have it bring you up any where either throwing you upon the rocks or landing you in the gutter. Every one has imagination in some form. The power to call up images, is in all normal human minds, and the power to bid them leave is there also. The sage can free his mind of either unpleasant memories or undesired imagin ation, by an effort of pure will or by a substitution. It is just as easy to substi tute one imagination for another as one memory for another. The power to conjure is a ready power and easy to handle ; ghosts, hobgoblins, saints and sinners will come at a wave of the magic wand, and if you did but know it, at another wave they will disappear.

We condemn self-respect, pride, self- love and self-pity, because to respect your self is, to a great extent, to be satisfied; and to be satisfied in this sense of self-admira tion, is to check all further advancement along the line of consciousness.

A haughty, self-respecting person is ever sensitive lest his pride shall be hurt, and challenges the world with his satisfied gaze ; which world, proceeds immediately upon the challenge to knock him down. It is not in the least strange that the young Philosopher is proud, because an in creased sense of power makes one superior, and being strong, he takes delight in mani festing this consciousness. There are two reasons for this ; one is that he sees the littleness of his fellow-man as he never did before (this is right), and the other reason is that he is not yet himself sufficiently in love with the object of his pursuit (say truth) to rise above this enervating con sciousness of self (this is wrong). We find ourselves only in something outside, never in dwelling on self emotionally. To dwell on self in this way is to sap your own life. This has nothing to do with self-con templation intellectually, which is desir able. We prohibit emotional self-contem plation only."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"44 SOME PHILOSOPHY Pride is an emotion, a feeling ; self-respect explains itself in its name. It is a warming up of self to self, an admiration of self for self, a gloating over, a feeding upon self. This is one of the greatest evils.

Do not mistake us. Your final object is to find yourself, but you never can do it by self-admiration. As you never have seen your own face except in a mirror, you never can behold yourself except in another. When you gaze into the eyes of a friend you find a little image of yourself imbedded there.

The true Philosopher does not carry his pride with him long. Before he enters the narrow path he is stripped naked and his pride falls first. He is allowed nothing heavy about him, and pride is heavy; he has to run, for he is after something which eludes and evades him. His eye must be steadily fixed on the object or it will escape him ; and self-respect would be a fatal encum brance. He becomes so in earnest in view ing himself in the thing that he is after that he forgets himself altogether; this proves that one who would save his life must lose it in the life of another. The first sorrow that comes to the young Philosopher is the fall of his pride; when it has been broken he becomes a servant ; and that to the very ones upon whom he for merly looked down. &quot; He that is first shall be last.&quot; He stoops to conquer, and when he again holds up his head, it is for the pur pose of seeing better, rather than that of looking over the hats of people."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"46 SOME PHILOSOPHY The object of this Philosophy is to gain power; not that we may come down on others with crushing blows, but that we may give them a lift upward.

Save your energy for the race; you are supposed to be after something and very much in earnest. Other people will see you running and possibly they will start in too, just for the running s sake, and later on they may find an object to chase. If you have a vestige of pride left, if your self-respect still lingers; if your self-love whimpers and whines, get rid of them all.

Let me add also, that they are dangerous every one of them, from the highest to the lowest. A crank is an unbalanced person; by this we do not mean insane, but one whose consciousness is clouded; he wears a veil and does not see straight ; he is cross eyed and intrinsically evil.

Ignorance and short sightedness do not mean crankism. A crank has crooked sight ; no matter what he sees nor how far, everything is out of gear, distorted.

A crank s vision is out of focus; not only his physical vision, but his mental and psychical vision as well. The mass of humanity have a vast deal of common sense. Selfishness develops this very early. The great body of mankind adjust themselves to their environment without knowing why. They avoid spectacles and steer clear of oculists. They have a sort of horse understanding which enables them to find a stable and fodder. Selfish ness is the cause of this, but it is a proper selfishness and of a different kind from that of the crank. If the crank is not born an Egoist he very soon becomes one, for it is almost invariably the love of notoriety that leads him into eccentricities. He longs for some sort of"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"OF THE HERMETICS 49 fame, any sort. The idea of the love of truth for itself has never entered his head.

If he gets a following, he begins to believe in himself and finally concludes that he is inspired ; having no balance, but only love of fame, he does more and more absurd things until the world hisses him down. His disciples become contaminated with his unholy magnetism, and become lesser cranks themselves, rushing with their erratic Master to destruction. There are religious, scientific, artistic, scholastic, dogmatic cranks ; cranks of both sexes; cranks among the rich and the poor.

Beware of the others, but very much of him ; he is horned and hoofed and clawed. He can hurt you with his head or his feet or his hands, even with his eyes. In fact, His Majesty the Prince of Evil, is a crank, if crookedness means anything.
