Chap ter I reflects my mood at the time. I believe there are matters addressed fo r the first time in this book—in 1993— which are important to your freed om and that of your loved ones. The truth in this case requires exposing a conspiracy. The word \"conspiracy\" has been made a dirty word by those involved, like dogs under the table, knawing on a few bones and scraps thrown to them by those above, and growling at anyone who threatens thei r precarious security. Conspiracies exist, they are sometimes real, and real conspiracies can be harmful to those who pretend they don't exist. This book will disappoint those who e xpects it to be filled with tales about little 'aliens', or about how I wa s abducted and used as a sex slave by giant Venusian females (or weird little alien guys who have 'implanted' me, or experimented with my sex organs, etc.). This book is about the \"flying saucer\"- —sometimes called the \"UFO\"—what it re ally is, who invent ed it, and why our government still conceals it after over fifty years of use by it. I also explore the political, social, economic and historical context in which Big Brother has maintained a hoax of gigantic proporti ons, by lying to and brain washing the public, and oppressing intelligent witnesses, to conceal the saucer secrets from us, and why. My \"space aliens\" are actually people, whose philosophy and bizarre masquerade are alien to the American way of life, since they believe in government by anti-democratic hoax, to maintain the secret power of the Trilateral Commission elite, to whom our lives are very cheap. Some who read this may thoughtfully consider it and agree wholeheartedly, because it is reasonable, knowledgea ble, logical and true. Others may be disconcerted and will read no further, avoiding the cold light of reason, preferring to continue believing Bi g Brother's fantastic lies. It takes courage to admit being duped. Some ma y be subscribers to The Skeptical Inquirer magazine, misplacing confidence in what Philip J. Klass... supposedly a \"fellow skeptic\"....says about those 'crazy believers' in \"alien flying saucers and ghosts\" (all in one breath, mind you). Read further, as there is more here for you. Still others will mo re vehemently dislike what I say, knowing it is true, because they are among the guilty CIA an d NSA, etc. A small minority of the guilty may secretly like what I say, but be unable to break the \"national insecurity\" bonds which hold them rigidly in place, being forced to continue to lie to their follow humans . Still others are beyo nd reason or any human sentiment, being motivated blindly by money, power, and a desire to \"hold onto what they have\". Thes e are the \"ruling class\". Th eir fear of the truth is very real, and commitment to continued concealment total. The wealth they were born into is rooted in banking, minerals, chem ical cartels which process "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"these, fuel companies, the pharmaceutical industry, banking, automotive or aeronautical manufacturing or trans portation...planes, ships, trucks, and trains...anything the general public pays ev ery day for. We are their 'captive' source of money and power. There is one technology which more certainly than any other, has the capacity to drastically alter the Vested in terests which sustain the elite, with its posh lifestyle, and even threatens to destroy it; electro-propulsive \"flying saucer\" technology. It is not my desire to see anyone's honestly acquired economic security or prosperity ruined. It is my desire to s ee the collapse of whole empires, be they built on coercive monopoly, and fascist- state power, which exists at the expense of the freedom and well-being of innocent and pr oductive people, gained and held by secr ecy, extortion, force, theft, suppression and concealment of valuable, creative t echnology, which woul d also make our planet cleaner, more beautiful, and more accessible to everyone, and allow the peoples of the world to get to know and to appreciate each other more intimately and directly than ever be fore. No one, be they government, corporate, or individual, has the legi timate right or power to conceal such technology, unless they invented and created it, which they did not. The existing state of apparently monolithic interests, while presently appearing to be held firmly in place by a chain of powerful government, financial, industrial, technical, military, judicial and law enforcement entities, cannot maintain themselves forever, and it is unrealistic to think that they can. For those who are threatened by the p ublic advent of this long-suppressed technology, here is the handwriting on the wall: PREPARE FOR THE LIBERATION OF ELECTRO-PROPULS IVE TECHNOLOGY FROM THE HANDS OF THE SECRET GOVERNMENT, BY THE PUBLIC AT LARGE. CONSIDER ALL THE IMPLICATIONS, AND ACT ACCORDINGLY. The puppets...the \"professionals\" of pseudo-paranormalism and pseudo- skepticism...don't have so mu ch to lose, and much more to gain. They can probably find more productiv e jobs selling insurance or used cars. Though they may not like sitting in the COLD LIGH T OF REASON, it will only hurt for a little while. It must be an uncomforta ble and weird feeling to \"lie for their country\", which would not be so bad if that was all they were doing. There is nothing \"patriotic\" about co rralling the minds of your fellow citizens with a fence of lies, so they can be \"broke and branded\" as the dupes of the BIG LIARS. The suppression of this technology is not in the national security interest. Some who spread such lies harbor no patriotic delusions, enamoring themselves shamelessly to the covert money masters, performing like puppets, thoughtless and calloused. They will only co me painfully alive when they face the music, once they are publically unmasked as professional liars for Big VI"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Brother. I can hear the comments now: \"...Oh...ya' mean ol' Joe there? Why he use ta' be one of them big- shot You-fologists, 'til it all come out that it wuz just a big lie to cover up gov'ment fl yin' saucer stuff. Sad, ain't it?\" It is not difficult to imagine the strange mental processes involved in searching for a new way to present th e same Old Tired Big Lies which saw their American premier at Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947, giving birth to the \"Twin Lies\"....that \"aliens have landed\" and that \"flying saucers don't exist\". This BIG LIE SYSTEM was. originally designed by the intelligence personnel of the Gestapo, the Reichsicherheithaupt amte VI (\"National Security Agency Div. 6\"), and the Roswell hoax and the drama which followed has a dualistic nature which is typical of the gnosticism which wa s the basis for the SS religion 1 . Former SS intelligence agents at Alamogordo desi gned and initiated the Roswell hoax. Yes, the two sides were Siamese twins, born of an SS father and CIA mother, representing two opposite side s of the same bogus wooden nickel, counterfeited in America as one of the first shams of the CIA under the fraudulently misnamed \"National Secu rity Act\" of 1947, which was never submitted to Congress for its approval, because its authors—CFR bankers at Pratt House—knew it contained so many unconstitutional provisions and violations of American liberty and sovere ignty, that they feared it would never be approved. (It \"went into effect\" like most illegitimate usurpations of rights and powers, through executive edict.) The \"Siamese Twins\" born at Roswell were the two, diametrically opposite prongs of the Pentagon's co ncealment apparatus, UFOlogical Paranormalism and Sk eptical Official Denial A more organized skeptical initiative was later mounted, as a 'civilian' ad junct to the official deniers, as the counterpart to UFOlogy. Both these fiel ds were planned by the CIA and grew out of the ranks of the CIA's and Air Force Intellig ence's plainclothes and covert agent contingencies. This also included such people as businessmen, university professors, astr onomers, astrophysicists, meteorologists, other scientists, and aeronautical experts, many of whom were alread y affiliated with the government's secret projects. Many new press, magazine , book, and screen writers, producers and actors were soon on the payroll, to launch the \"alien\" scenario through the popular media. Th ere were similar fabrications and concealments in academi c areas and textbooks. Since I originally wrote about the movie-UFOlogy-CIA connections in 1993, there have been ma ny others who have co pied me, and to my knowledge, none of them has given me a ny attribution what soever, though to my knowledge, I was the first to do so. 1 Jean-Michel Angebert, The Occult and the Third Reich (t he mystical origins of Nazism and the search for the Holy Grail), McGraw -H ill Paperbacks (1975) p. 4. vii"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Of the two counterparts, the UFOlogist s seem to have it better than the \"skeptics\", who appear rather dull by comparison, but spice up their work only by criticizing and debunking their more interesting twin. There are more possibilities among the UFOlogy circles for exciting soci al, romantic, and sexual encounters, since they are a more interesting bunch of huxters, though an intelligent person soon finds himself longing fo r another rational being amongst them. To come up w ith more fascinating subject matter, the skeptics must set their hooks much deeper. Their magazines debunk some false and fraudulent shams—perhaps dangerous to one's mental or physical health, not to mention the pocketbook—only to add fa lse credibility to their irrational denials that flying saucers exist. I can agree with most of the skeptic material, yet their CSICOP flying saucer psychopha ncy is inconsistent, which reminds me of Ayn Rand's statement: \"There ar e no contradictions in reality; check your premises.\" The great contradictions in the skeptical arena, are based on false premises planted there by devious , manipulative, lying, CIA-employed pseudo-skeptics, which even many of the innocent true skeptics have failed to identify or to expunge, but they're easy to spot. To allow these great contradictions to be proliferated in skeptic literature, as reasonable, logical and true, when a lie, poisons the whole arena, like a gangrene of reason, and makes fools of the 'skeptics', and a mockery of the whole movement. Did it ever occur to them that the publications and money behind it came from the CIA? As indivi duals who pride themselves as having truly ethical intellects, it should be an im portant part of the skeptic agenda to identify and drive out this \"alien implant \", which has been using them to carry out the CIA's campaign of lies for too long. It takes an outsider like me to tell them about it. The 21st century should be a \"flying saucer economy\". The people who should appreciate this writing the most, are those who are inquisitive, truly skeptical, intelligent, reasonable, individualistic, creative, ethical, imaginative, scientific, and above all, excited and optimistic about the possibilities of opening up a new era in human history, wher e all mankind will enjoy the greatest invention man has ev er conceived and built, the electro- propulsive flying machine generally known as the \"U FO\", \"flying disc\", or \"flying saucer\". You may either consider this as fic tion, fact, or a mixture of fact and fiction. That decision is always up to the individual, for, to paraphrase Aristotle, we are never lied to; we must first lie to ourselves before we can accept a lie as the truth. As for myse lf, I HAVE NO MYSTICAL BELIEFS, ACCEPT NOTHING ON FAITH, A ND ASSERT NOTHING AS THE TRUTH UNLESS I HAVE GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE IT IS TRUE. Though I never ask you to believe me on faith, evidence is sometimes scarce.

If some Americans have the deluded misconception that the 'Sacharovs' of this world are only in Russia, they sh ould consider that our Sacharovs are so thoroughly buried by deceitf ul socio-economic oppressi on...carefully conceived and carried out by the Secret Governme nt...that the world does not even know of their existences, much less that they are \"virtually\" imprisoned or enslaved. The present system of nuclear power generator technology was stone-age and intentionally chosen as archaic, inefficient, and obsolete. It was already know by Nikola Tesla—even before Enrico Fermi split the atom without realizing it, and while Einstein was still a second class patent clerk in the Swiss patent office—that all the electricity mankind needs can be easily extracted from the self-replenishing atmosphere, by using a special M.H.D. (Magneto- Hydro-Dynamic) generator discovered by Tesla. It is so simple that a college freshman in physics, with an elementa ry knowledge of machine tools, could build and test it in his dormitory room. A closely related, publicly available technological source of the \"acceptable\" variety, is in Physical Chemistry 2 . The author laid out the scientific facts, leaving it to the creative to figure out the use. One gram of radium (approx. 1/31 oz.), pl aced in a lead box with an aperture directed into an air tube, criss-crosse d by a magnetic field and el ectric field plates, will create and separate abundant positive and negative charges from air, in sufficient quantity to replace the entire Four Corners Regiona l power complex, indefinitely. This revelatio n is only a juxtaposition of Tesla's earlier discoveries of around 1904, and earlier patent of 1901 . After Tesla discovered that J.P. Morgan had pretended to subsidize him in bad faith—even disguising his greed as philanthropy—in order to gain a controlling interest in all Tesla's patents, Tesla's only recourse was to withdr aw his application on the patent. Nonetheless, we still have the unlabel ed patent drawing, and with this knowledge, need only fill in the labels. (This patent drawing is shown in Chapter I. Tesla so feared for his life from the ominous power of the Morgan interests that he continued to prai se Morgan's business ethic in public statements, saying \"..I would stake my life on it...\". According to Tesla, all his inven tions were initially conceived in furtherance of his \"elect ric flying machine\". The a tmospheric generator is sometimes used as a power source on saucers, as confirmed by a renegade 2 PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY, E. A. Moelwyn-Hughes, Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1965.

Each particle carries two units of positive electricity. This will produce 34 zillion alfa - particles per se cond, at 4.5 Mev. The number of charges per second, yields a huge a amperage which, when stepped dow n to normal 120 VAC, is staggering.

The same method will work with a pure gas such as helium or hydrogen, in an encl osed reactor which recycles the same gas over and ove r. Tesla's method for extraction of electricity from air is fairly illustrated as follows (with some minor corrections to be done in respect to angles of ejectment of particles and positions of plates): I have no doubt that, if you really read this book, it will change the way you see many things, especi ally the 'flying saucer phenomenon', energy, corporate power, the judiciary, and even our local cops. Just remember that, unless we all come forward and speak out, Big Brother (our government and the Trilateral Commission) will continue to spend our money to enslave us. As for my scientific theory and flying saucer plans, I rely on the words of Leonardo Da Vinci: \"IF YOU GET IT RIGHT ON PAPER, IT WILL WORK.\" This book is dedicated to my sons Angus and Matthew, to my friends, and to all the readers who showed their appreciation, encouragement and support, and to the memory of Jewel Gibs on, author of Black Gold and Josh Bean and God, who, as my English teacher at Sam Houston State University in 1964, en couraged me to write. "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION The first crude edition of this book was published in July, 1993, under adverse conditions and pressure which had only recentl y subsided. At that time, I was attempting to 'get back on my feet' after a very intense six-year period of judicial abuse, which followed on the tail of a total of 17 years of judicial abuse. This particular abuse was instigated by the CIA in 1975, through various employees, dupes, and toadies, some of whom were New Mexico lawyers, judges, law enforcement personnel, and political party officials (Democrats and Re publicans), ultimately acting under orders from the CIA, beginning George Bush's a dvent as CIA director. In preparing to publish in 1993, 1 took considerable security precautions, although I had a pre-publishing leak through a dishonest \"reviewer\" (who never wrote the review), in April, 1993, who was recruited by the CI A during his teen years. This gave the CIA advance notice. A copy of my original Introduction reached a CI A (\"M.I.B.\") around march, 1992, through a mutual \"friend\" who betrayed me. My first 100 copies were printed clandestinely by copy machine. I silk screened the cover, then had a local printer overprint it with black. I did the collating, binding, and trimming. The second printing, of 1,000 copies, was printed from my negativ es and plates by a local printer, then collated, bound, and trimmed by me. The CIA a pparently got to the printer, so I had to stay on his back all the time to get the job out much behind schedule, with only 800 poorly printed copies. My first meager entry as a writer-publ isher in 1993, saw immediate changes in UFOlogy, after no more than 50 copies were sold. After all, even before my book had appeared in local Santa Fe bookstores, the Copyright Office had certainly furnished CIA/Langley with a copy, with counterinte lligence strategies soon formulated and expedited by the intelligence community. Even the first leak of 1992 (the Introduction), probably resulted in a copy appearing on a CIA desk at Langley. As a proximate result of my 1993 publishing , the total output of OSI (\"Office of Scientific Intelligence\", CIA) false propagand a has at least quintupled, in terms of new movies, TV series, books, and magazine articles. There was also some specific misinformation released in video form in Germany, based on (CIA-generated) material, released through the \"Hermann Goering Branch of the Knights Templars\", an OSI front group, directed specifically at counteracting my book. The CIA knew as early as Dec, 1991, of my intent to produce this book, since I had announced it quite freely among legal 'colleagues' and their spies, who had harassed me for so long. I had known for at least forty years that CIA/OSI disinforma tionists control the UFOlogy network, which they themselves created, involving all mass media, especially TV and publishing. As I anticipated, they were among the first people to contact me, their general plan being to give me the 'kiss of death', consisting of quickly arranging to distribute my book—a 'holding action' intend ed to induce my detrimental reliance and to create a time delay—as they picked my mind, and counter-published \"monkey-see, monkey-do, look-alike-type\" books, videos, and magazines intended to protract the same old mis-and-disinformation, while attempting to \"steal my thunder\", by pretending to say something superficially similar in their books—which, unlike my samisdat, would be ALIENS 1"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"massively distributed—to counteract it before the general public could be exposed to my long-suppressed message, Their main strategy however, was to increa se the sheer volume of material in the bookstores, to make my single book a proverbial 'needle in the haystack'. Basically, they BURY you in their B.S. At the same time, they loaded my mailbox with a barrage of their propaganda, thinking that they might 'contaminate' my stuff with their phony 'alien' stuff and other incredulous garbag e. I knew long before looking at their material—and can with confidence project th is to include their future material—that they now have, and will in the future have , nothing new to say, and are only repeating the same Old Tired Big Lies in a slightly more \"sensationalized\" and cosmetically disguised form, to 'fresh' audiences each y ear. In addition, they have regenerated a whole new batch of the same old fabrications in the areas I addressed, such as the facts surrounding the end of WW II, in respect to the \"secret\" amnesty and partnership agreement between the U.S. and Germany, and what I call \"The Phony Fall of the Third Reich\". They have also created a profusi on of names for German flying saucers and flying saucer projects, most of which never ex isted, were called by other names, or were known by disguised code letters, such as \" p2\" and \"KT-p2\" (the projects I unearthed) were known by. I pretended to rely on these first contacts, using them to whatever limited extent possible to distribute a nd popularize my book, while pursuing several other avenues of approach to the public. Many distributors are CIA fronts, since prompt dissemination of their propaganda throughout the UFOlogy network is indispensable to their jobs in the intelligence disinformati on network. Those distributors who are not witting CIA fronts, or complete dupes, have become so economically invaginated with the CIA-created mythology, that they could not afford to immediately free themselves, even if they wanted to. Economic dependency is a powerful motivating factor. One of the propaganda thrusts spread the erroneous idea that the \"Nazis\" invented the flying saucer. With apologies to the ghost of general George Patton, let me suggest that this is tantamount to saying that such a thing as the A-bomb or the airplane is a \"Democratic\" or \"Republican\" invention! Firstly, a \"Nazi\" or \"Communist\", per se, never invented anything, since only individual s do that, and have usually been looted by various statist cretins throughout history. S econdly, the \"totalitarian mind\" is by its nature one of a collectivist looter and enslaver, not of a creator or producer. And finally, Nikola Tesla's invention of the \"electric flyi ng machine\" which was later to be called the \"flying saucer\" or \"UFO\", is documentable back to the early part of this century, while his conception of it goes back to the 1870's, during his student days at the Technische Hochschule at Graz, Austria. The idea of Nazi flying saucers is as old as the hills, beginning with the 1944 \"Foo-Fighter\" publicity, yet even this has remained somewhat suppressed because, though incomplete or incorrect as propagated, is a version which is revealing of certain scientific facts (the corona discharges) and close enough to the truth to point a skilled independent investigator in the right direction, and eventually toward the truth, provided he is armored with sufficient scepticism to traverse the precarious minefields (mindfields) of disinformation wh ich have been laid on all sides. I again emphasize that all the ascertainable secret German documents and important developments came into the hands of th e OSS/CIA at the end of WW II, not only ALIENS2"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"because of such thorou ghly exercised searches, but also by the anti-virtue of the special \"deal\"—ala Operation Paperclip and Reinhard Gehlen's Amt VI 1 — between Germany and America. There are no documents from the Nazi sources or from our government or any cooperating government, which have not been either destroyed or permanently classified, or first been given the disinformation \"treatment\" by the CIA, before being \"declassified\", released or otherwise cove rtly disseminated through whatever outlets anyone may claim. This same rule applies to the statements of all active, former, or retired military or government personnel who were subject to a security order, for a period of at least 20 years from the date of said order or agreement, and all agreements of a higher order, relating to knowledge of flying saucers, even apply a lifetime statute of limitation. Incidentally, I possess the only known true 'leak' from the original Nazi flying saucer source, via a security lapse of Sandia Base personnel in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The FBI's statement on this matter was that I could not be prosecuted for possession or disclosure because I had \"...obtained all my information through innocent means.\" In addition, I have not been subject to a national security agreement since 1977, 20 years after I signed an agreement while in AF Intelligence in my 18th year. Since I was never given direct access to flying sa ucer secrets anyway, the information I independently collected and devel oped on my own was never covered. The main person attempting to spread the idea of a \"German origin\" for the flying saucer, is an unabashed 'Naziphile' named Ernst Zundel, who owns Samisdat Publishers Ltd., Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He began his publishings at least as early as 1976, and like me, underwent intense judicial harassment, but was misled to believe the harassment was because he is a German \"holocaust revisionist' or 'denier', while the apparent reason is because his flying saucer material is \"too close\" to the truth. The more Zundel was harassed, the more adamant became his Naziphilia. Meanwhile, some of his best saucer books went out of print, just as his harassers desired. Zundel has remained completely unaware that it was r eally his saucer material which attracted the animosity of the Canadian national security establishment, pursuant to the secret orders under which he was judicially harassed, similar to how I was judicially harassed in New Mexico, under the ostensible guise of \"property dealings\", during the same approximate period of time. Though novel in some respects, Zundel's idea of how German saucers worked was incorrect if not completely lacking, being unfortunately subject to prior Nazi/CIA disinformation via Paperclip, and a vague idea of jets, rockets, or so me mysterious, esoteric \"anti-gravity\" system of Felix Schauberger, involving a \"water vortex\". The Canadians were most likely worried that Zundel might turn up a German-to-Canadian technology transfer dating to 1945 or soon thereafter. In 19531 made my first close-up daylight sighting. In 19611 had discovered the 1941 Nazi testing of the neutron bomb on the Libyan desert. In 1963 I discovered the exact scientific basis for sa ucer propulsion, and in 1966 found out about the \"stalemate\" of 1945, involving 24 German \"Electro-U-boats\", towing specially designed, smaller subs , carrying (what I believe may have been V- 6) rockets with celestial guidance systems and armed with neutron bomb warheads, fueled by red mercury (a mercury-antimony oxide which 1 Christopher Simpson, BLOWBACK (Wei denfeld & Nicolson, New York, 1988).

In 1996, a documentation of these small missile-carrying subs, developed under the \"Lafferenz Project\" 1 was provided to me by Henry Stevens of the German Research Project, Gorman, Californi a. The smaller, rocket-carrying subs could be tilted to the correct firing trajectory wh en desired. Like later American I.C.B.Ms, such as the Polaris A-l missiles carried by our Lafayette class nuclear powered submarines, the missiles could be fired from underwater. I also learned in 1974 that Wernher von Braun had worked in New Mexico in the late 1930s, something which was common knowledge among local rocket pioneers whose work dated from that period, such as the late Peter van Dresser of Santa Fe and El Rito. I had no source for the complete saucer electri cal theories and mathematical formulae, until 1979, a year in which I made great headway. In that year, I acquired knowledge of a 1937 pre-WW II Illuminati \"p2\" project at Los Alamos, run by von Braun, and acquired the only known extant piece of physical evidence from a WW II 1943-vintage German flying saucer, based on the Tesla discoveries first developed in New Mexico a nd taken to Germany, before being returned to New Mexico around 1945. This evidence is a cele stial guidance slave compass from the \"KT-p2\" project, in which von Braun included the original New Mexico 1937 \"p2\" project name, after he had removed it from Los Alamos and transported it to Germany, in 1938, with the apparent good graces of our FBI. The device was on one of the German saucers brought to post-war Sandia Base under Operation Paperclip in 1945, soon followed by a 15,000-person German scientific contingency's exodus to New Mexico 2 . The guidance system was an invention of Nikola Tesla, developed and tested on a 200-mile round trip radio controlled aircraft flight test in conjunction with the Sperry Gyroscope Company, in 1917 3 .1 eventually located the source and substance of the scientific data and formulas for the saucer , rediscovered the electromagnetic method for its application, and documented the previously suppr essed and intentionally confused historical background concerning the work of Nikola Tesla. In 1997, I authored OCCULT ETHER PHYSICS: Tesla's Hidden Space Pr opulsion System and the Conspi racy to Conceal It (ISBN 0-9637467-2-3), which I revised in 1998 (ISBN 0-9637467-6-6). It is a documentation of the 19th century scientific research leading up to Tesl a's great discovery, which at its earliest, appeared to be in 1891. Zundel had approached the saucer question with the characteristic tunnel vision of one intent on cleansing away and assuaging German guilt for the crimes of Nazi-era Germany. This is as silly as an old Stalin-worshiper trying to say that St alin didn't kill off millions of his own people, even including ten million members of his own Communist party. When will people realize that the purpose of Illuminati-created wars is to kill off as many \"excess\" Germans, Jews, Russians, Americans, British, French, Gypsies, and other peoples as possible?

It is no accident that Adolf and Eva H itler lived out their last days in Kassel. \"Oh, really!\", you exclaim. Read on. Despite Zundel's controversial view, he was almo st correct about Hitler's planned last-ditch stand against America, using flying saucers and other 'wonder weapons', along with several other 'Wunderwaffen' which were not mentioned as such in Zundel's material, but which I identified for the first time, as the basis not only for one of Hi tler's brilliant alternate plans—according to the judgment of the best Russian military analysts who later studied it—but for another even more brilliant plan for which the first plan-evidence of which was conveniently left for the Russians to find in the Berlin Fuehrerbunker—was a mere cover, and which was actually consummated by the coercion of a secret amnesty and partnership agr eement between the U.S. and Germany, buttressed by the exodus, under Operation Paperclip, of Nazi saucer R&D, over 400 top scientists, and over 15,000 scientific and technical \"slaves\", to the U.S. government and the IllumiNazi corporations and banking interests. This plan is so embarrassing that they dare not fully declassify it even today. Though this revelation may startle some of you, its truth is gradually falling, piece by piece into place, from evidence continually surfacing all over the world, especially since the collapse of the Soviet State. Some people have mistakenly attempted to trace the destination of the Nazi \"technology transfer\" to Antarctica or South Am erica, and I'm sure the CIA fuels this false scenario which they created. Some of this technology and people involved may initially have gone to South America or elsewhere prior to the finalization of this agreement, until the treacherous combination of the German Amt VI (\"Dept. 6\") SS RSHA (the Nazi organ upon which the CIA was based), the new CIA created on the Nazi model, and British, Canadian and Australian intelligence, and even Russian intelligence, found and took care of them, wher e any critical part of the \"Big Secret\", or any key scientist was\" involved. The simple truth is that the flying saucer technology and personnel came to the U.S. of A., lock, stock and barrel, right where Hitler and the rest of his gang agreed to, in order to buy their asses a new lease on life. My original edition of this book is the most important publication of all time on flying saucers. True to my anticipations, the inevitable CIA look-alike books and other counter-publishings have not plagiarized my original theories, since their objective is not to claim my theories or to advertise them, but rather to \"steal my thunder\", to overshadow, cloud and suppress my actual findings and distribution of my book, and to obliterate what I have to say, with a voluminous mass of bullshit, spread primarily through the CIA's \"UFOlogy network\". They have not attempted to discredit, mention, or even to discuss my theories, since this would attract the public's attention, invite meaningful dialogue, and draw in true scientific scrutiny, which I welcome. They prefer to pretend my book does not exist, while using the 'placebo' effect to pacify the public's continual thirst for answers on impe rtinent questions, while confusing or misinforming them on the American and Nazi saucer deve lopments, through CIA-doctored pseudo-leaks and other blind allies.

The CIA now uses Zundel's saucer material, since there is nothing harm ful in it, because the information available to him had already been carefully screened by them in 1945, for all potentially valuable information, then altered before being declassified and made available to Zundel and other interested parties. All important information which could not be falsified or misinterpreted, remained classified Besides, the Germans themselves were quite capable during the war of creating information \"scrambles\", and running 'aerodynamic' saucer projects, just to conceal the 'real' one, most likely at Zeppelinheim, south of Frankfurt, or at the Blohm & Voss works in Hamburg, confirmed by a knowledgeable spy friend assigned to the area of Hamburg during the war. Reinhard Gehlen's Amt VI SS RSHA was quite capable of such mis-and-dis-information, in fact invented the CIA's version and implemented it for them. After all, hadn't the O.S.S. hired Reinhard Gehlen's Nazi intelligence network under Operation Paperclip, forming the nucleus of the new CIA? From the moment that the electro-propulsive saucer's full potential became evident in the early 1930s, forward to the present, rocket projects have been a cover for the \"real thing\", and ironically, this sham was first actualized in 1937, at Los Alamos, New Mexico, based on stolen Tesla technology, under the tutela ge of Wernher von Braun. Hitler had appointed the Prussian Illuminist as \"Herr Doktor Professor of Research\" and project leader to run his Vergeltungswaffen (\"revenge weapon\") center at P eenemunde, before his collaboration with the American rocket pioneer, Dr. Robert Goddard, at his laboratory in Mescalero, New Mexico, and rocket test site at Eden Valley, New Mexico. 1 Afterward, von Braun would never allow the high priority (\"p2\", \"KT-p2\") 'space travel' project to be too far away from his watchful eye. While collaborating with Goddard at Mescalero, von Braun ran the Illuminati flying saucer project at Los Alamos called \"p2\", between 1936 and 1938! 2 He was given a leave of absence by Hitler for this espionage, and was brought to America by the Smithsonian In stitution, the Guggenheim Foundation, and the American Rocket Society, who financed his work and paid for his trip!

Despite the thoroughness of the FBI, O.S.S/CIA and the Gestapo, enough evidence remains to document the fact that Tesla's original sauGer developments were earlier than the first successful liquid-fijeled rocket shots of Goddard, Oberth, or von Braun, and the information I unearthed here in New Mexico, documents the acquisition by 1937, by German interests, of Tesla's discovery, indicating the long-standing fallacy of the rocket projects, which were gleefully paraded before us all those years by von Braun and his American Peenemunde clone, NASA. None of the material from Zundel or from other German sources even mentions the \"KT-p2 Projekt\" (muchless \"p2\") or von Braun as its real head, or mentions anything about the technology I alone uncovered While some vague disinformation regards \"Nazi experiment s with electrical discharges\" (said to relate only to \"electronic jamming devices\"), the allega tions of \"electrogravitics\" are based on vague, esoteric and even 'ancient' pseudo-sources (which in fact are pure mythology), and the information goes no further. Other information from American sources is inconclusive and tainted by the presumption of misinformation as well, due to its prior control by the CIA. For example, \"How...\", you may ask, \"...coul d the CIA (or its affiliates) plant ancient 'Vimana' material in ancient Hindu or Sanskrit manuscripts?\" It should not amaze you to know that many of the 'interpreters' of such works were often East Indians with Oxford or Cambridge degrees, who worked with British intelligence an d MI-5, and the OSS in the WWII Asian Theater, and that intelligence agencies hire many such scholars and finance their work Their interpretations are often a matter of...interpreta tion. What is meant in Hindu my thology, as an analogy to the Arabian 'flying carpet', suddenly becomes a \"space ship\". While I may know for a fact that there was advanced machine technology akin to ours today, in 1450 B.C., the Vimana stuff isnt it. Playing around with mercury (the so-called \"mercury gyro\") isn't easy, and many of the theories I've heard are just plum dumb. Besides, if you ha ve any concrete idea of aeronautics, and you've ever really looked at the \"Vimaana\" stuff, you will see for sure that it is obviously dumb. The true electro-propulsive principle of the Tesla-based American-German saucers cannot be found by ordinary research, because the CIA has al ready covered all the bases. There is a publisher who would have stolen my thunder on this issue, but was unable to discover another source, so was stuck with the options of either acknowledging and citing my prior publishing, research, and detective work, or of plagiarizing me, so he begr udgingly \"...killed me with faint praise\". I tend to think his reluctance reflected eith er CIA pressure, or his fear of the strong possibility that I will subsequently be proved correct. Another jealous author who agonized over my discoveries, who claims to be a physicist, even made the ridiculous claim that he \"discovered\" that saucers are powered by gyroscopes. Gyros create only feeble gravitational 'anomalies' (\"weight loss\" but not \"anti-gravity\"). He appears to have gotten this idea from a combination of the Vimana' literature and my book, since I was the first writer to introduce the fact that the Kreisel Teller processed, which was the only solid tie between flying saucers and 'gyroscopic' action, other than vague references in recent CIA/OSI pseudo-leaks through Germ an and Austrian sources, to a Flugkreisel (\"Flying-Gyro\"), in misinformation designed to tie into the pseudo-\"discovery\". Later CIA-produced 'German' documents contain the word \"Kreisel\" (\"gyrating\" or \"gyroscopic\") in misrepresented contexts. This man had no prior source other than my book. When I met him in the summer of 1994, he immediately asked me about a matter in my book, right off the top of his head, but never ALIENS7"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"mentioned me or my book in his bibliography. I suppose that since I discussed and rejected the gyro idea, he was free to claim it, but the idea wasn't mine in the first place. Since he had obviously never seen a saucer up close, if at all, it was probably my mention of the precessive effect which reinforced \"gyroscopic antigravity\" in his mind. Aside from my pointing out the saucer's precession, the theory of gyroscopic antigravity is as old as the hills, and no one has ever been able to lift a ship off the ground with it, because the magnetic field of the earth is far too weak. This pseudo-scientific theory has always been encourag ed by the CIA, since it is wrong, and serves no better purpose than to buttress and further embed su ch false explanations into the UFOlogy field, and to damage the scientific credibilities of a ll those foolish enough to espouse or to believe it. The alternatives presented are: (a) the \"air-blower\" (\"boundary layer\") aerodynamic propulsion systems based on the theories of Ludwig Prandtl and the unverified work of Viktor Schauberger; or (b) an ancient, obscure 'viman a' propulsion system (purportedly a \"mercury vortex\" drive) misinterpreted from East Indian Sanskrit religious texts such as the Bhagivad Gita; or (c) an unknown propulsion system based on \"shared alien technology\" which is \"too complex for our comprehension\"; or (d) centrifugal force gadgets which sling weights around in attempt to increase the centrifugal force in one direction and decrease it in the opposite direction (failing to take into account that the 'increase' in centrifugal force in one direction causes the device to behave as if the center of rotation were in the center of angular momentum, so that the 'gain' on one side is canceled by a loss on the other); and finally, (e) the purely electro-propulsive ether-based system which can be documented in the work of Nikola Tesla as far back as the 1870s. As you should see, the last alternative is th e only feasible one, and I have documented its discovery in Occult Ether Physics. There are several other minor systems originating with various tinkerers which just won't make the grade, some of which involve tortured mathematics and pseudo-science of the ley line, ge omancy, and Stonehenge variety, et c., or some mysterious stuff called \"Schumann resonance\" (which was declassi fied by the CIA when they disseminated the documents referring to it), and finally the work of the Englishman, Searls, which is only rumored to get off the ground, but obviously lacks a control system. Some experimenters may have inadvertently stumbled across something which causes weight loss, or a feeble thrust, but without understanding the simple and correct ether conc epts and physics, are unable to succeed, mostly because they are looking for someth ing too complex, if they have not in fact been supported in their futile research by the CIA. Altogether, the alternatives ot her than the Tesla proposition, too conspicuously place saucer propulsion in the area of the unknown, the unobtainable, the wacko, or depict it as the obscure and indeterminate work of mystical, pseudo-scientific cranks such as Viktor Schauberger or Bruce Cathie. When you see a real saucer performing at its high capabilities up close, you know it is not powered by any of these feeble contrivances, but requires the great force and magnitude which can only be scientifically attributed to the gravitat ional-to-electromagnetic conversion constant, which is 10 40 x fg. The opportunity for a civilian to see a flying saucer up close is much rarer today than it was in 1953, on the West Texas desert to the south of Alamogordo, New Mexico, where the German prototypes were brought, tested and developed after the war. Since none of the writers I know of producing recent works, have ever seen a flying saucer as I did in 1953, or possess the scientific perspicacity required to interpret what they saw, I can only conclude that their information is Johnny-come- lately \"researcher\", se cond-hand conjecture and speculation, abject CIA-duped falsity, or outright CIA misinformation, since almost anyone of ALIENS8"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"scientific mind, who ever actually saw a flying sa ucer in the glory of its full potential, would immediately laugh at such phony, CIA pseudo-science, Nazi ass-kissing books, new age charlatanism, illicit money-grubbing plagia rism, and grand-standing sensationalism. As my acquaintance, former Air Force Colonel, Phil Shaw, of Austin, Texas said in 1967 1 , \"There haven't been any leaks\". Shaw was the former director of two of the most important regional offices of Air Force Intelligence's Oper ation Blue Book—Reno, Nevada, and Reykjavik, Iceland—before studying jewelry making at the Univ ersity of Texas. Both before and since then, there were some leaks, and I'm the one who had his bucket set to catch them. I made no bones about it with Shaw, openly accusing him, in the presence of prof essors and other students, of bending to his CIA orders, in our life drawing clas ses at the University of Texas Department of Fine Arts. I even embarrassed him a little bit when I showed other students that the lock on his locker in the hall was CIA issue! Shaw made a weakly valiant effort to discredit me, and I thought it no accident that Iceland was a strongly suspected site for wartime German saucer bases, while Reno, Nevada is very definitely 'saucer country'. Shaw knew I was right, but could never admit it. No gyros, rockets, jets or 'conventionally powered saucers could ever produce the results I saw in 1953, and neither could \"mercury gyros\", \"a ir suction\" or \"boundary layer\" methods. I knew that a very powerful electrical force, which could be instantly altered and changed in direction, was involved, and this book is the first and only known book to reveal a viable scientific basis for this very real force and the simple method by which it is implemented and controlled. No other researcher in this field has provided any means by which such great force, directional control, or maneuverability could be effected, mainly because they are ALL either CIA employees, whose job it is to hide it, or \"second-handers\"... \"writers\" and \"researchers\"... who can only follow up on CIA pseudo-leaks, snooping around for things which are just not there, or which were conveniently placed there by the \"Puzzle Palace\", so that these researchers \"...found the pieces, and put them all together\" (just as the Puzzle Palace planned), thinking they had really 'discovered' something.

Klass and a few others represent the CIA's invasion of the \"secular humanist \" field, to take it over and use it as another OSI base of operation to attack flying saucer or alternative science research ers, or writers who may threaten to uncover what I call the true, \"occult\" science of ether physics. This is a brilliant and effective tactic, except for the fact that the \"officially accepted\" Big Lie physics of today is a prima facie case of flakiness, based on the phony \"elastic space and time \" concepts taken by Einstein from the Lorentz Transformation, giving birth to Relativity and the \"Big-Bang\" cosmography, false theories for the public having their roots in the Machiavellian manipulations of Rosicrucianism and the Hermetic Mystery Traditions. In so doing, the CIA has managed to sucker the humanist/sceptic element more firmly into supporting a flaky and false Relativism when, as true sceptics, they s hould be looking into the concealed alternatives.

How many have been led astray by these leading CIA 'spotlights', Philip Klass and the Smithsonian Institution? Klass's false and in fact mystical assumption that all flying saucer \"believers\" assume that saucers are of extraterrestrial origin, and simultaneously believe in ESP, ghosts, and other irrational paranormalism, is itself a \"paranormal claim\" being made by Klass. Those who live in glass (\"Klass\") houses shouldn't throw rocks. I promise as a true sceptic not to make even one 'paranormal' assertion or claim! The fatally tragic flaw of most \"alternative\" scientists, is that, in attempting to understand \"ether physics\", they have irrationally tried to reconcile immiscible Relativism—created by the Hermeticists to conceal ether physics—with ether physics, which is based on the \"Fixed Universe\" theory, which is not nearly so static as the \"Big Bang\" theory and Relativism True sceptics would be critical of the mystical physics being enforced upon us by the establishment media. By comparing the gist of my book with what the OSI has conspicuously omitted or artfully confused, it is clear what they seek to hide. They have hauled out all the old time-worn OSI mis-and-disinformation, and erroneous CIA-tampered Nazi stuff, all altered before being made available to anyone. The documents of the Nazis were collected in the days when they shot first and asked questions later. A review of existing theories shows that, until this 1993 book, the truth was concealed. Isn't that rather odd? My over 40 years prior knowledge made me feel very alone, and I have never ce ased to be amazed at the garbage the public has swallowed all along the way. It should be obvious to intelligent readers as to why my simple, rational, scientifically verifiable explanation—conspicuously absent from all prior sources—has been omitted. I had known since 1953 that the propulsion system was electrical, a fact systematically omitted from the milieu of ideas and information available in pr ior sources. There are only three possibilities for saucer propulsion, which are (1) electricity, (2) elec tricity, and (3) electricity. That is because ether propulsion can only be electrically created The thing which makes the 'electro-propulsive' flying saucer—as well as universal gravity—possible, are some odd flukes of nature, involving the natural interplay between fundamental positive and negative electrical charges in elementary matter, the existence of a universal ether (which I call \"Omni Matter\"), the permeation of space by omnidirectionally interpenetrating Zero Point Radiation (\"ZPR\"), a nd the natural electromagnetic field and enormous electrostatic forces emanating from the earth, which affect the ether through which it moves. The proof of the pudding is in the eating, and intelligent and knowledgeable witnesses who have seen a saucer in action up close, know it is real, and should see that it works on electrical principals. The things which makes these truths now available to you, are the fundamental intelligent human thought processes which are essential to your survival as a creative and independent, thinking person, rather than to give your mind over to the sway of a raving and hysterical Naziphile or other mystic who is peddling irrationality and endless fa ntasy for the Pentagon, in hopes that he can obtain money, by supplying phony answers which always requires more scientific knowledge and understanding than anyone possesses, so the truth remains concealed just as the Pentagon planned.

With all the typical themes already 'set', writers who work for the CIA have a rather hackneyed job of trying to come up with new kinks on the same old themes, always avoiding the one true theme which has been so conspicuously omitted, which to me is much more exciting than all their shabby, shopworn \"alien\" fantasies.

This flaw, which will be the cause of their eventual downfall, is a lack of creativity, which gives them a need to incestuously breed, copy and repeat contrite old lies in order to steal the truth. This fatal flaw is best illustrated by an ancient an alogical story about a monkey which was trapped and enslaved by its own self-negating greed, as follows: A young man was attempting with no success, to capture a monkey in a jungle. Along came a wise old man, who kindly consoled the discouraged young man. and said, \"In order to trap a monkey, you must first understand the basic nature of a monkey, and \"think like a monkey\". I will show you how it is done.\" Where upon the old man took a glass jug, filled it half way up with nuts, and tied it firmly to a tree. The young man asked, \"How do you expect to trap a monkey with that?\" The old man, with a smiling, wry twist of his wrinkled old mouth, said, \"Just wait, and you will see.\" The two men hid in nearby brush, and remained quiet for an hour or so, when finally a monkey descended toward the jug from the dense foliage above. Seeing the nuts in the jug, the monkey extended his skinny hand into the jug, grabbed a large handful of nuts, and attempted to pull them out, except the mouth of the jug was too small to allow the passage of the monkey's hand full of nut s. Nonetheless, the monkey tightly gripped the nuts, refusing to release even a single nut. He stupidly continued to tug at the nuts to no avail. The old man came from his hiding place with a rope, and simply walked up and placed it around the alarmed monkey's neck. The monkey allowed himself to be captured, rather than to release his grip on the nuts in the jug. To the stupid monkey, stealing nuts was more important than his personal freedom, which he never missed, until he didn 't have it anymore. Then he sadly became a mere toy for the amusement of others, who kept him at the end of a leash when not in his cage, for the rest of his life. The monkey was sold to an old CIA organ grinder, and learned to dance at the end of his leash, to a collection of redundant Old Tired Tunes, monotonously ground out on the old man's whining organ, as the monkey begged for money on the streets ofWashington, D.C.Just across the street from the Pentagon.

There is a lot of CIA garbage out there, often purporting to be \"great revelations\" about such subjects as \"Nikola Tesla's work\", \"anti-gravity\", and \"free energy\". I have never seen so many books, pages, and words so totally devoid of originality, percepti veness, enlightened consciousness, or any significantly real knowledge about the subjects purportedly covered. Some of these people are literary vacuum cleaners—\"br ain suckers\"—of the ideas of others. They lack the special knowledge to comprehend the material they are purporting to deal with, so their books are little more than bundles of dissimilar ideas packed together without coordinated or integrated editorial comment or design, propagating collecte d-from-others, self-neutralizing concepts, often claiming that \"the author discovered\" or \"the book reveals\" this or that, or 'exposed' something or other, which it never did anything of the sort. Not a single novel revelation or concept is placed in them by the bureaucratic committees which write them in haste. The most this trashy stuff can do for the Illuminati oil, energy, banking and transportati on cartels, is to buy a little time. It makes me wonder, for example, how much time can be bought for say, $10 million in false propaganda costs (which we ultimately pay for)? I don't believe that the public can continue to buy into these hoaxes forever, because there are many intelligent, technologically gifted and discerni ng people in our society, who have remained in the background, because the CIA garbage has neve r significantly attracted their interest. These people have held their opinions and conclusions in abeyance, until a more reasonable explanation comes forth, such as that already provided in this book. One of the my basic concepts is how great ideas have been lost throughout history, by having fallen into the hands of evil and cunning, fraudulent sociopaths, barbarians, destructive religious fanatics, liars, charlatans , and hucksters, or in this case, coercive monopolists. One of the greatest examples of this in ancient history, was the destruction and looting of the great Library of Alexandria, now in Turkey. Had th e keepers of the library not coll ected so much of the ancient world's greatest knowledge in one place, it could not have been destroyed there and lost to history and humanity, in one catastrophic event Given the extent to which documentation shows that ancient conspiracies have been connected to the concealment of illuminating knowledge, just as in our own time, it would not surprise me to learn that the fall of the Library at Alexandria was ALIENS 12"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"engineered by an ancient Mystery School cult, with the fall of the city to the Turks being either preceded by the documents being carried away to ...the Vatican Library...o r spirited away to the Alhambra.

The similar accumulation of such knowledge in the secret vaults of the national secu rity establishments of the world today, suggests the possibility of a repeat of ancient history, which could set the human race back yet another 1500 years. Though there are some who may relish this idea, a millennium of ignorance or the black plague do not sound so enticing to me.

Why else would they have labored so diligently for over fifty years keeping such technology secret, ostensibly under the guise of \"national security\", except to perpetuate their coercive socio-economic, technological and political monopoly?

They carry this out by promoting the TBLs and excluding the MRA. I am expanding this third alternative, creating a Wedge of Reason, to be driven between the TBLs, to expose how the MRA has been buried, confused, ignored, excluded and obliterated by the TBLs, which are: 1. That flying saucers do not exist; and, 2. That if flying saucers do exist, they are extraterrestrial. These two (false) options—propagated by two supposedly opposing factions—are unmistakably like an answer to a legal complaint in a lawsuit, in which the defendant first denies all allegations (a demurrer), thereb y challenging those who allege the existence of flying saucers, to prove their existence.

If one examines the complete past liturgy on this matter, they will see that it was the government which first introduced the \"alien plea\" at 1947 Roswell, as a fraudulent \"dilatory pleading\" intended to expand the issues into irrelevant areas, to create delay, confusion, and wasted effort, and especi ally to evoke a response from us. This gets us involved in a dialogue over issues which are entirel y impertinent, to exhaust our energy, and in summary, to completely avoid the merits of the issues, getting us absolutely nowhere for years insofar as the real truth is concerned, just as th ey planned. The fact that these two options clearly show the \"badges of fraud\" typical of a quasi-l egalistic deceit, should have long since alerted rational thinkers to their design by a single contro l group, the CIA, on behalf of the IllumiNazis. The reason the options bear unmistakabte similarity to legal pleadings, is because the CIA likes to hire lawyers, because the CIA th inks—as one official put it-that \"...law sc hool teaches a future employee how to think\" 1 . The frivolous, impertinent, long drawn out and dilatory pleadings of the last 52 years, shows the indelible marks of \"lawyers at work\".

The frivolous \"prosecution\", made on our pseudo-behalf without our consent, is joined by the ridiculous counter-allegations of the (Secret Go vernment) \"UFOlogists\"—such as those regarding \"advanced alien technology\" and \"a bductions\"-and the phony debate is protracted ad infinitum. Under the circumstances, these \"pleadings\", and al l their spurious combinations and variants, are knowingly false and fraudulent, since their proponents have access to the truth, and fail to plead to the merits of the issues which they clearly seek to avoid, as a fraud upon us and the 'court of public opinion'. They also fly in the face reality, since they are inheren tly contradictory. There are no contradictions in reality, only confused facts and false premises. While the rules of civil procedure allow a defendant to make contradictory defenses, a knowingly false defense, entered for purposes of a sham, can be stricken by the court (of public opinion), and the defendant held in contempt. One popular false (combination and variant of Options 1 and 2) option, posits 'terrestrial' saucers, based on \"alien technology\" which is so expensive and far beyond our comprehension that we should forget about it, or, since it is being shared with our government—so the story goes—we must wait until the government decides to 'share' it with us, their damned bosses. All these allegations are not only outrageous, but co mpletely false, and people should wake up and realize that they have been hypnotized. Options 1 and 2 are both repugnant, since any re asonable, knowledgeable person realizes that the distances to earth from the n earest habitable planets (perhaps millions of light years) is so great, that the 'alien' possibility is ruled out for frivolity, but (in the complete absence of the MRA), Option 1 is often accepted.

I: The Most Rational ALTERNATIVE The third alternative—the \"MRA\"—is as follows: 3. That all saucers are real, man-made flying machines, invented and flown by human beings for over fifty years, there being no alien contacts whatsoever on earth. This option comports with what philosophers call \"Ockham's Razor\" (a test which cuts between bullshit and reason). Furthe rmore, 1 reiterate that saucers are based on relatively simple, long-known electrical technology, consummated in the late 1930s, when technology was comparatively primitive. This alternative challenges the OSI/CIA to prove—through their agents and dupes—what it falsely asserts. They have failed to do so after over 52 years, and can be presumed to be liars and huxters (since \"dupes\" is reserved for civilians). Since the OSI doesn't even want my MRA to exist, it will never be seriously or consistently argued by (their) proponents of the TBLs, who will not plagiarize me, or even risk addressing the issues. They have attempted to conglomerate some of my ideas with some of theirs, or to \"steal my thunder\", but the truth is not compliant to such a corruption of ideas.

Considering this, I point out the incredibly devious route the Secret Government takes to \"manufacture witnesses\". A case in point is a woman I later mention, Vicki Landrum, who may still believe that a NASA employee named John Schussler is her \"friend\". Schussler has been transferred' to the OSI, and now propagates the abductions-by-aliens scenario. Landrum thought he had been \"fired\" by NASA for backing her up, but this was part of a \"good cop/bad cop\" routine, intended to create his 'cover 1 as a 'sympathizer', in his new job with the OSI. Landrum is smart enough to figure it out. At the time Schussler sidled up to her, Landrum was in dire need of help. While pretending to help Vicki Landrum, Schussler was spying on and misleading her for NASA and the OSI, his new boss. In order to understand all this, many need to do some self-assessment and careful examination of the facts, during the time they became unknowing tools. There are a few people who have just jumped on the 'UFOlogy' bandwagon, saying whatever it takes to sell books or establish themselves as \"witnesses\" or \"a bductees\". Then there are those who were unwittingly used by the OSI, through the use of such drugs as scopolamine, chloral hydrate, sodium amytal, or even more exotic techniques and drugs, combined with hypnosis. The dupes are usually chosen by personality profile, epistemology (must be Platonist), religiousity (also Platonist), as well as possibly neurological abnormalities such as certain sleep disorders, any or all of which may render them especially vulnerable to the 'manufacturing' pro cess. There is no guilt for having been conned Dr. John Mack 1 sociopathically concentrates on na rcoleptic patients . The \"abductions\" scenario came into general use around 1975 (just prior to the Travis Walton incident in Arizona), when the CIA reali zed their Old Big Lie program had become stagnant and needed a new, more bizarre twist. The scam incorporated new special eff ects, fancier props, better acting, better drugs, and more professional sets. A documentation of some of the inner workings of some of these scams was sent to me 2 in early 1994. In my first edition, I mentioned that a book had been stolen from me before I had an opportunity to read it, having forgotten its title and author, but in a phone call from author Walter Bowart, I was able to dete rmine that it was a first edition of his Operation Mind Control, because it had a red and black cover, and was p ublished in England The female OSI book thief had lived with Dr. Jacques Vallee for two years, and was the same woman who stole two photographs (one showing three rhesus monkies in G-suits, and the other showing a rather corny and poorly fabricated fake \"flying sa ucer\", in a hanger) which had been sent out to area newspapers by the Army Air Force Intelligence P.I.O., Walter Haut, in the initial Roswell Hoax. These photos, and my Peiltochterkompass, were sufficient physical evidence—originating with the government itself—to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the U. S. government had Nazi flying saucers, and had executed the Roswell Ho ax to conceal their terrestrial origin, followed by the Pentagon's \"Weather Balloon Hoax\", designed to conceal the first (bungled) hoax. Because of the connection between Vallee and the OSI she-thief, I had realized that the theft was engineered by the Secret Government, and now realize that the thief worked under Vallee, whose main job has always been to straddle the fence, continually vacillating between the questions, \"are UFOs real?\", \"are UFOs illusion?\", \"are aliens here?\", or \"are UFOs secret 1 John E.

ALIENS 17"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"government aircraft?\" This is so they can maintain a balance between both sides of the phony debate, which does not even consider the fact that the UFOlogists and people like Vallee work for the CIA. Since my evidence could have tipped the scales completely off the balance, they had to steal it. They refer to such thefts as \"retrievals\". For an intelligent person who has never seen a saucer, there is always the lingering possibility in the back of the rational mind, that they simply don't exist, like ghosts. Once a person has made a broad daylight, close range sighting, there is no longer any doubts as to their existence, and the person should be able to confidently proceed to solve the remaining questions, if not suckered into falling into one or the other side of the phony debate. By the time I was eight years old (1946), I had already interviewed many reliable witnesses who had observed \"flying discs\" in the vicinity of Roswell (130 mi. N.W.) and Alamogordo (180 mi. W.N.W.), so I knew they existed, and had probably been brought under Operation Paperclip to Ft Bliss with Wernher von Braun and his 116 top scientists, in September, 1945, when von Braun was appointed Chief of Research, U.S. Army Ordnance 1 . In the spring of 1947, 1 had caddied for my father's first 36 holes at the Roswell Country Club, and caddied another 18 holes there a few weeks later, in a professional tournament in which he was \"first runner-up\", winning a new Remington electric razor, and a set of Samson ite luggage. While observing the sky while waiting between shots and putts, I saw a few dime-shaped di sks glinting in the sun, but wasn't sure they were flying saucers until my 1953 clos e-up sighting, in which the sau cer departed in a trajectory directly toward Ft. Bliss, at c. 9,000 mph. If there was ever alien contact, I would probably have known it, and if anyone has proof, here I am baby! Just hit me with the evidence (and I don't mean a bunch of government documents, or pseudo-interpretations of ancient Sumerian clay ta blets)! I have been waiting a long time, and I'm still waiting, but I don't expect proof this late in the game, especially since I know any \"proof would be a fabrication of the OSI \"MYTH FACT ORY\". If this statement seems blunt, I have no apology, and my feelings won't be hurt if you con tinue to insist on the Ridiculous Big Lies—that there are aliens from outer space, manipulating the human race—since I know these \"aliens\" are really Pentagon-created delusions, and that those of you who really think you believe the alien stuff have been made jackasses of by the OSI. Feel your ears growing longer? It is impossible to \"believe\" a lie. Why? Because, in order to \"be lieve\" something, one must have some \"means by which they know it to be true\". Since a lie is untrue, the means is non-existent, and what is purported to be the means, is first a lie to oneself, an agreement with the self to believe a lie.

Myth Factory Many have never heard of the OSI, or are confus ed by the fact that th ere are at least three OSIs. The first one was the Office of Special Investigations, supposedly set up to investigate Nazi war crimes and criminals after WWII, and was appe nded to the Tribunal at Nuremberg and the U.S. Department of Justice 1 . This O.S.I, was compromised by helping to protect or conceal many war criminals through its complicity with Operation Paper Clip. The second OSI is the Office of Special Investigations, USAF, which was set up to pretend to investigate \"UFO\" sightings, having as its real purpose the plugging of leaks about flying saucers connected to the Air Force. The third and most important OSI is the Office of Scientific Intelligence, a branch of the CIA's Science Directorate 2 , Clandestine Services, set up to gather 'strategic' scientific information, to disseminate classified 'strategic' mis-and-dis-in formation, and to run programs designed for such purposes, which includes fomenting domestic \"U FOlogy\" groups and related hoaxes. Its most important function is plugging any and all leaks regarding flying saucers, by whatever means necessary, on behalf of its IllumiNazi bosses, and to prohibit the development of such resources by private individuals. This particular OSI was and is the most secret of the three, and use of the same \"OSI\" tag was probably intended to maintain this secrecy by confusion. It has worked pretty well until now. Imagine a group set up to protect Nazi criminals, named the same as one set up to prosecute them. The OSS and Reinhard Gehlen's Amt VI, SS RSHA had a baby, called the CM. I have always believed that the purpose of all three OSIs involves the Nazis and flying saucers. The first OSI not only investigated war crimes, but also insured that independent post-war investigators looking into the Nazis, did not probe into flying saucer technology, or the secret technological and political deal entered into at th e war's end, between the Third Reich, the U.S. government and certain CFR/Trilate ral/IllumiNazi-owned corporati ons, all neatly concealed under Operation Paper Clip 3 . The OSI maintains numerous teams of Ph.Ds. The procedures followed by these teams in the production of appropriate propaganda, are identical to those used in movie production or political campaigns. The scenarios for their scripts are base d on the old pre-generated scenarios, as they apply to 'intelligence', gathered from the public, such as what writers like myself are saying, and the public's reactions. After evaluation of current intelli gence, false propaganda counter-strategies to be used in the dissemination stage, are designed by OSI clandestine operations personnel. OSI think tanks' brainstorm on plans and proposals, to generate 'new' possibilities on the old themes which are used as 'guidelines', and some of these possi bilities are incorporated in proposals. The writer teams then prepare numerous scripts, based on current strategies recommended by evaluators. Final proposals, including scripts, budget breakdow ns, potential producers, production schedules, etc., are then reviewed, with approved projects ad vancing to the production stage. \"Script writers\" are chosen to 'front' the scripts, and money is provided to producers. 1 Victor Marchetti and John Marks, The CIA an d the Cult of Intelligence (Dell, 1980-84). 2 John Marks, The Search for the \"Manchurian Candidate\".

III: Gravity and Tesla's Work Some of the most basic scientific facts and pr inciples are being concealed and misrepresented, beginning in kindergarten, so we must each re-exami ne nature, and question all theories, in order to identify and reject scientific lies and omissions , and to rediscover and propagate \"true science\". About 1937, \"science\" and space propulsion becam e really schizophrenic. While Wernher von Braun ostensibly developed rockets, he covertly developed secret Illuminati flying saucers; while Albert Einstein's relativism and Werner Heisenberg 's \"uncertainty principle\" were being publicized, the 'ether physics' of Nikola Tesla and others was being ridiculed, yet was secretly being used for saucer propulsion and wonder weapons so highly classi fied that they were never even intended to be used in WW II. H. A. Lorentz had said that, by simply increasing the negative \"moving\" charges (orbital electrons), attached to the \"stationary\" nuclear charges (protons and neutrons) of atoms, that the gravitational attractive force acting on the positive charges of the nuclear mass would be completely neutralized. Add to this the constant conversion formula—which says that the electrical attractive force is 10 39 x 2.2 times stronger than the gravitational attractive force G 1 -—by which Lorentz had suggested a scientific hypothesis for an electrical flying machine, such as that already under development by Tesla and supported by his ether propulsion discoveries. Tesla at first conducted tests 2 (the high voltage experiment s relating to the high frequency reactance between two parallel metal plates), to verify his hypothesi s. His tests confirmed that at sufficiently high voltage and frequency, the \"space\" (containing the ether) between the plates, became what Tesla termed \"solid state\", verifyi ng the existence of what I call the \"Omni Matter\" (A.K.A., \"the ether\") which behaves under sufficie ntly high voltage/frequency \"Tesla currents\", as if it is a 'continuous, electrically conductive fluid', possessing mass, inertia and momentum, which can be 'pumped', to suspend or propel the plates in space). Tesla then carried the hypothesis a step further, and concluded that an el ectric flying machine could be prop elled by electric current and the reactance of high frequency, high voltage electroma gnetic waves. This electricity would use the 1 R.L. Armstrong and J.D. King, The Electromagnetic Interaction (Prentiss-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffy N.J. 2 T.C. Martin, The Inventions.

ALIENS20"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"inertia of the 'continuous, electrically conductive fl uid mass' of the Omni Matter, to be pulled and pushed against, using the Hall effect magneto hydrodynamic (\"MHD\") principle. The ether physics of Tesla was quite different from the theories of others, and was based on astute observations and sound experimental scien ce. In 1876, H. A. Rowland had published the results of his experiment in which a gold foil covered ebonite disk was rotated in a magnetic field, showing feat electric charges on the disk were carried around with it as it was rotated. 1 This gave rise to the catchy phrase, \"An electrostatic char ge carried around is a current\". Rowland's student in Baltimore, Edwin H. Hall, based on his teacher's work, had done an experiment in which he had placed a gold leaf strip in which a current wa s flowing into a magnetic gap, producing an electromotive force at right angles to the magnetic field and the current, proportional to the product of the two. 2 This is called the \"Hall Effect\", and we know that it was influential on Tesla, because he mentioned it many times, because it is the basis for MHD (Magneto-Hydro-Dynamic) generators and pumping, and was used by Tesla in his electro-propulsion. In his 1891 lecture, Tesla stated that the \"enormous electrostatic forces\" emanating from the earth, \"rigidifies\" the ether within earth's electric field, as it moves through space \"like a charged metal ball\" (due, as he would later say, to ear th's movement through space at over 70,000 mph.). To Tesla, the ether was composed of \"independent carriers\", \"immersed in an insulating fluid\"; while this ether behaves as a solid to \"heat\" and \"light\", it behaves like a \"fluid\" to solid bodies, which are allowed to pass through it. 3 Furthermore, according to Tesla's analysis, a D.C. brush current could be used on the forward end of a ship, to create a \"rarefaction\" of, and \"rapid exchange\" of the carriers, which would stretch the medium and create an inducement of movement in that direction, while a high frequency alternating current would be used on the opposite, trailing end, to cause a \"compression\" of the ca rriers, which would block their passage. According to the later researches and publishings of J. J. Thomson 4 , he had mathematically developed the theory of moving tubes of force. Two years later 5 , Thomson declared that \"...the aether is a storehouse of mechanical momentum\". Tesla, in his prior lecture 6 , had mentioned the tubes of force and disclosed some of his discoveries concerning the ether and momentum Tesla had stated that all his inventions were created in furtherance of his \"electric flying machine\" 7 , which he had partially designed before coming to America, carefully carrying the plans under his arm when he arrived on the ship in 1883. The rest of his things were stolen on his 1 H. A. Rowland, Ann. d. Phys., clviii [1876], p. 487. 2 Edwin H. Hall, Amer. Jour. Math, ii [1879], p. 287. 3 T.C. Martin, Supra (Chap.

Thomson had stated in 1893 that if moving tubes of force entering a conductor are dissolved in it, mechanical momentum is given to the conductor, at right angles to the tubes and to the magnetic induction, and is proportional to the vector product of electric and magnetic forces. 1 Tesla's statement in 1891 that the use of high frequency alternating current would compress and block the passage of the tubes was apparently intended to force the tubes being drawn into the conductors of a ship by the D.C. brush at the opposite end, to dissolve in the conductors, and impart momentum to the ship to which the conductors were attached, in the direction of the brush. Tesla said he had developed his Dynamic Theory of Gravity in 1893 and 1894. He never published it, since to do so would have disclosed the secret to his electro-propulsive discoveries, which he did not want the war mongers to get. In 1942 and 1943, the FBI stole, concealed, or retrieved every known complete copy of the original theory. The theory can be pieced together only from bits and pieces, such as collateral references, in still-available sources. I will give the basic tenets of the theory in this book. In 1915, in an unpublished statement 2 , Tesla related his discovery, while in technical school in Graz, Austria, of \"...a flying machine quite un like the present ones...\", \"...devoid of sustaining planes, ailerons, propellers and other external attachments, which will be capable of immense speeds...\", \"...sustained and pr opelled entirely by reaction...\", \"...which will be controlled mechanically or by wireless energy\". Tesla was never involved in rocketry, so these statements clearly referred to a diffe rent sort of electric flying machine, propelled by the reactance of high frequency electromagnetic waves and electric current In 1900 3 , Tesla described how movement of the control apparati could be effected, \"...when they are carried by a vessel floating in the air...\", by \"...connection of one terminal of the receiving apparatus\" to th e ground, \"...inductively\". This pertained to how a flying saucer may be induc tively (\"virtually\") grounded by the neutral or positive terminal of \"p2\". (NOTE: \"p2\" will be explained later in this book.) In 1940 4 , Tesla announced his Teleforce, consisting of four already tested inventions, as follows: \"(1) A means of producing rays in the free air without a vacuum; (2) a method of producing a very great electrical force; (3) a method of amplifying this electrical force; and (4) a new method for producing a tremendous electrical propelling force.\" 1 J.

In a Dec. 8, 1915 article in the New York Times, Tesla had brought up the same electrical propulsion system—except with a generator on the ground supplying electrical energy to an airborne ship via beam—which he said would travel over a million miles per hour (perhaps its potential velocity in outer space, as this seems exaggerated.) To show you how insidious the misinformers are, and how easy it is for them to dupe sensation-addicts', there have been several recent instances where the misinfoirnation regarding the four above listed inventions, from the original 1940 New York Times article, has been misstated in a sly and oblique way that few would suspect, right under the noses of the \"Tesla experts\". The four inventions were already tested at the time, and (4) was indisputably a propelling force. Anyone who ran down the original article to examine it as I did, would know that Among the several places I have discovered this misrepresentation, was a so-called \"patent\" on HAARP (High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program). The only purpose for such a fraudulent misrepresentation would be for the expl icit purpose of misrepresenting the original Tesla material, to those studying Tesla's work, b ecause it represented one of the few 'unretrieved' leaks of Tesla's discovery of the flying saucer propulsion system. The patent 1 is now held by Arco Power Technologies, Inc., under which they purportedly perform \"top secret\" tests tor the government, from the North Slope of Alaska The patent is allegedly one of three patents previously locked up under a Navy security order. To begin with, patents are not issued on inventions primary to secret projects. Whatever the real purpose of the HAARP project, you can bet your booties it isn't what they say it is. Secondly, the real purpose of planting the false particulars in a 'patent' which should never have been issued, is so that the misinformation would end up in publications read by 'alternative re searchers', to obscure and misrepresent Tesla's discovery of the ether propulsion system used on flying saucers. And who is ARCO? ARCO (Atlantic Richfield Oil Company) was created by Trilateral Commission/Council on Foreign Relations member Robert O. Anderson, of Roswell, New Mexico, the creator of Diamond A Cattle Company, the largest holding company in North America, which owns all known oil shale deposits in North America, and almost all minera l rights in the North Slope of Alaska. Anderson was also, at the time the second edition of this book was published, the President of the Bilderburgers, about which I will have more to say later. Early on, during the 'fuel crisis' of 1974, Arco moved to garner a monopoly on solar and alternate energy resources, apparently based on a fear that the reactionary alternate energy movement could cut seriously into future foss il fuel profits. The misi nformation placed in the 'patent', was repeated 2 just precisely where it shouldn't have been, but just precisely where the Secret Government wanted it Once something like this gets started, where does it stop?

ALIENS23"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"who should have known better, did nothing to stop it. Where the ball goes, nobody knows. We cannot allow this Trilateralist misrepresentation of Tesla's work to go unchallenged. If we search the early inventions of Tesla (the later ones are concealed by the government) it appears that along with the Tesla coil, there were several related inventions such as generators and a marvelous turbine, intended to provide a compact and portable means for the generation of power needed on the flying machine---a \"prime mover of sufficient activty\"--invented to supply electrical current for the coil, as the fundamental device to increase the moving negative charges. This also explains Tesla's fascination for such a low weight-to-power in his turbine, using the motto, \"20 Horsepower Per Pound\", on the masthead for the \"Tesla Propulsion Company\". By \"propulsion\", Tesla included ether propulsion. IV: Dealing with \"Equal and Opposite\" Forces If the Tesla transmitter produced negative pulses which \"preponderated\" over the opposite pole of \"p2\", the question as to whether the \"equ al and opposite\" forces would propel the saucer, depended on several things. Since the electrical a ttractive force is so much stronger than the G force, it would be conservative to conclude that a small amount of electrical power would be sufficient to propel a relatively large mass through space at an astounding speed, relying on the fact that all mass has excessive positive charge, and that the ether has sufficient positive charges and rigidity to provide somethi ng for an electric flying machine to \"pull against\", as it accelerated in a particular direction. This electrical attractive force is thousands of zillions of times stronger than the gravity force which pulls it toward the gr ound! Great care would be required in designing the shape of the flying machine' s surface, since it might cause th e acceleration of objects toward itself, as well as itself toward them. By use of a concave parabolic shape, tor example, the electric force would be focused at the center of its radius, at a particular distance from the inwardly curved surface. On a machine of la rge mass, this shape could cause a smal ler object to be jerked toward it with fantastic force. It could literally jerk a person' s head off, were it located at the focal point of the parabola If, on the other hand, one wanted only to \"beam up Scotty\", a carefully controlled, weaker force could be exerted with a small, parabolic dish of slight curve, pointed downward, in or on the bottom of the machine as it hovered, to pull an object (or person, or young bull), up into the machine. An appropriately designed flying machine should have a reminded, gradually curved surface, to prevent the leakage of charges into the atmosphere as much as practi cable, as well as to insure that the electric force would be disper sed and radiated outward over a broad area, so as to avoid focusing the force, and to diffuse it over a gr eater volume of space, containing greater mass (of atmospheric gasses, distant bodies, and the polarized , 'solid state', Omni Matter), so the smaller mass of the machine is, attracted forward or upward, with as little disturbance of atmospheric mass as possible. This was the reason for the many Tesla experiments with rounded c onductor surfaces, his concern with atmospheric scie nce, and his care to see that th e elevated dome-shaped conductor for his Wardenclyffe Tower project was always positively charged (since a shot of negative pulses might have jerked it off its supporting foundation). ALIENS24"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"There are so many rounded surfaces in Tesla's de signs, that it gave me cause to wonder why Margaret Cheney, in her Tesla biography, Tesla: Man Out of Time1, using a passe', post-mortem Freudian psychoanalytic technique, alleged that Tesla had a near psychotic phobia of \"rounded surfaces\", evidenced by his revulsion and fear of pe arls, based on an underlying \"fear of the female breast\". This hypothesis seemed belabored a nd misplaced, since Tesla's dislike for pearls appeared to be the result of his well-known phobia of germs, since pearls are essentially the result of a type of 'infection' in oyster s. Could this sloppily surmised \"phobia of rounded surfaces\" be an O.S.I-designed ruse to lead us away from one of the fundarnental ideas of Tesla's flying saucer? Did Tesla realty have an irrational fear of \"the female breast\" and \"all breast-like shapes\" (\"flying saucers\"), as Margaret Cheney said? Quite to the contrary, many of Tesla's inventions are a glory to the breast, and a display of his apparati looked like a veritable garden of breasts, to be sure. Howard Hughes certainly had nothing on Tesla in this respect. The final design tor his (originally \"titty-like\") Wardenclyffe Tower electrode, multiplied the titty motif literally hundreds of times, in different sizes! It looked sort of like a giant donut covered with bras. There is an unmistakable similarity between the Wardenclyffe Tower electrode, and early German saucers, presumably reflecting Tesla's original designs, which could just as well have been called \"Flying Titties\". \"UFOlogists might have been called \"Boobologists\". Is the female breast shape the most perfect flying saucer shape? I have to conclude that I think Tesla loved the female breast, and other such shapes. I won't dwell further on this lovely issue; I should have made my point, so now I'll cut to the chase. When Tesla died in 1943, few noted that a great scientist and inventor had died It was as if he had scarcely lived, and that his only contributions were A.C. current generators, distribution systems, and motors. Before what I call my 'Tesla Revival\", beginning around 1976, there was an obvious attempt to conceal Tesla's place in histor y, which I believe was because he invented the flying saucer. The national security establishment wanted to dispel private Tesla research or experimentation, since the most fundamental discovery associated with him-the Tesla coil—was also the fundamental discovery used to power the flying saucer. It is still against federal law to operate an unshielded spark gap and Tesla coil, or a Ford Model T coil with a spark-gap. These laws, dating from the early '40s, are still on the books, and though ostensibly enforced by the F.C.C., I think they were really intended to proh ibit civilian rediscovery of Tesla's' flying saucer. Tesla was irritated by Albert Einstein and his theories, and considered himself greater than Einstein. Why? The following comparison may answer this question: V: A Comparison of Gravitational and Electrical Force, As Applied to Flying Saucer Propulsion The electrical attractive force is 1039 x 2,2 ti mes stronger than the gravitational attractive force G. This equation is a constant, for converti ng from the gravitation to the electrical attractive force. 1 Margaret Cheney, Tesla: Man Out of Time [1981], Prentiss-HalL ALIENS25"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Example: 1,000 ft. -lbs. of mechanical energy are required to lift a 1,000 lb. flying saucer to a height of 1 ft. above the ground. This is 1,356 joules (1 ft.lb.=1.356 joules). Divide this by the above constant, to show that only a tiny electrical force will do more work than a 'conventional' mechanical force, such as that produced by rockets or propellers. This is true for work is done by a constant vertical force F, and motion in a straight vertical line in the direction of the force. The work done on a body is defined as the magnitude of the force, times the distance d through which the body move s. Inversely, the power produced by the constant gravitational force G, acting to move a 1,000 lb. flying saucer from a point 1 ft. above ground, to the ground, would be 1,000 ft.-lbs. (= 1,356 joules, the same equivalent work required to pick the saucer up, against the constant vertical G force, to the 1 ft. height). Since the magnitude of electrical attractive force is the G force times the conversion constant, and the work performed on a body equals the force times distance, then: W=fd,or Work = (10 39 x 2.2x 1,356 joules) x 1 ft.,or W= 40,492,781,690,140,845,070,422,535,211,091,549,295.77 miles. The above calculation would be true if the G fo rce remained constant for that distance above earth, so it would be much greater, since there would be no gravity to overcome once the saucer was outside the earth's gravitational field. The wo rk done by conventional energy, when converted in this manner, should theoretically do 10 39 x 22 times more work, though in practice, there are inevitable losses, such as corona leakage and electrical resistan ce reflected as dissipated heat, etc, in the application of power (which, to be conserva tive, might amount to as much as 30%). In view of the vast increase in work, such losses are insi gnificant. This phenomenon is one of the fantastic tricks of nature which can be utilized through science, and its discovery by Tesla in the flying saucer, is definitely the greatest invention I know of. No wonder Tesla considered himself greater than Einstein! After all, the saucer is certai nly more important than the atom bomb, though Einstein didn't invent the bomb, or anything else, for that matter, to my knowledge, other than Big Lie Illuminist Physics. On a positive note, what Einstein did invent, however, were many very sweet and 'profound' platitudes and anecdotes i nvolving the archetypical \"eccentric, genius, absent-minded professor.\" VI: Momentum and Applied Force Simply put, momentum is equal to the overall fo rce required to produce a particular increase or decrease in the velocity of a particular body. Th e rate of change of momentum is also equal to the applied force. Since an appl ied electromagnetic force is so mu ch stronger than an 'apllied' gravitational force, the rate of change of momentum is also that much greater. The force applied from a saucer, toward the ether in space, is emanated outward from a curved, convex surface of certain area, and di rected toward a much greater area of space, containing an ether which is rigidified by the enormous, rapidly varying electrostatic forces emitted from the earth, which as Tesla said caused the ether to assert its \"i nertia-resistance\". In addition, there are atoms and molecules of matter such as gasses and water droplets which presents more of a problem than a solution. The total reaction be tween the saucer and the combined rigidified ALIENS26"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"etheric fluid and carriers (Omni Ma tter) is apparently more considerable than one would think. This is partly brought about by the saucer's shape, which determines how the force is distributed. Though the saucer is a compact, more solid mass than the atmospheric gases and ether, the saucer is pulled at a high rate of acceleration. Th e real work done on the Omni Matter is apparently the result of the propulsive force created by the D.C. brush, as it eats up the tubes of force, which are forced to dissolve in the conductors by the high frequency blocking current at the ship's opposite end. The convex surface directs the force outward along lines which are perpendicular to the curved saucer surface. As th e lines of force extend outward, they grow further and further apart, to affect a greater total volume of sp ace and Omni Matter. Considering the density of vacuum space and the magnitude of the force, the interactance by astounding propulsion of a ship by the much stronger electromagnetic force, is the \"equal and opposite reaction\". The etheric fluid and carriers in front of the sa ucer are 'stretched', creating a low pressure (ratified ether) 'cone', as the charges also ca use the atmospheric gases to become mutually repellant According to Tesla, \"...on the assumption that the independent carriers are of any configuration such that the fluid resistance to motion in one direction is greater than in another, a stress of that nature would cause the carriers to arrange themselves in groups, since they would turn to each other their sides of the greates t electrical density, in which position the fluid resistance to approach would be smaller than to receding.\" 1 Tesla has described how the elastic force of the stretched ether has made movement in that direction easier. As the saucer accelerates to perhaps 9,000 mph., the shock wave is dampened by the low pressure cone, thus eliminating a potential sonic boom, as the gasses gradually return to plenum as the corona trail dissipates. The saucer's negative ion path and ejectment of mutually repulsive Omni Matter to its aft, causes the low pressure gasses also to be mutually repulsive , preventing them from 'clapping' back together so quickly, such as with the booms and cracks caused by lightning bolts and thunder. The saucer I witnessed in 1953 went from almost overhead, to infinity, in three seconds. It was between 35 and 50 feet in diameter. A rough calculation would be 9,000 mph., with no sonic boom or other sound, based on my being able to see it at 7.5 miles distance. VII: Energy and Time Neither energy nor time exist, since these are onl y fictions or concepts we have created, to measure, calculate or predict certain functions a nd reactions in and between space, matter, light, \"zero-point radiation\", \"zero-point ultra fine matter\", and cruder \"atomic matter\" (which may be only a concentrated assemblage of the latter). In 1963, I dubbed the ultra fine zero-point matter, \"Omni Matter\", saying it is the source of all atomic matter. This comports with Tesla's ether. \"Electrical content\" and electromagnetic force, in their most finite forms (u ltra fine Omni Matter and zero-point radiation in space) are very closely related to light (both visible and invisible). It has been said that this made Einstein and other Illuminists very happy, since it appeared to bring physics and cosmology into consistency with their Kabbalistic, existentialist, Illuminist, Hermetic philosophy and religion. Time is a concept describing the rate at which events in the universe 1 T.C. Martin, Inventions, Researches and Writings of Nico la Tesla, 1894, Chapter XXV - Introduction - The Scope, of the Tesla Lectures. ALIENS27"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"occur. Since one cannot \"travel\" in a \"concept\" (which describes a \"rate\"), it should have been obvious that \"time travel\" is a physical impossibility, if not an epistemological and metaphysical blunder. The shadows on a cave's walls can d eceive those who are content to sit and watch shadows, rather roan to venture beyond the cave, to discover the true nature of reality outside that little womb of false security. 'Objective reality', in the purely physical sens e, may consist primarily of electric magnetic force and ultra fine neutral particles, which in turn, compose all atomic mass. Since 'gravity' is the result of electrostatic imbalances to the exuilibrium existing between 'atomic' matter and ether- filled space, rigidified by the eff ect of rapidly varying electrostatic disturbances, in the space within the proximity of a gravitational body's electric fiel d, a \"super-gravity\" for ce can be synthesized by creating an electric field stress which creates an even greater, overpowering disturbance to the equilibrium, which can only be restored by movernent of a body so affected, until its position satisfies the 'equal and opposite r eaction' rule. The movement of th e saucer satisfies the imbalance created by the gobbling up and dissolution of the unidirectional tubes of force, which imparts momentum to the saucer, along the axis of polar ity of the tubes force, in satisfaction of the 'need' created This line of thinking seems to indicate how Tesla considered so-called \"nuclear reactions\"...electromagnetic reactions which produce powerful, very high fre quency disturbances in the zero point \"natural media\", which react with atomic matter. These reactions are deemed 'stronger' than normal electromagnetic ones, since their disturbances are of such high force (voltage) levels, and of such high frequencies, as to react strongly (resonan tly), with other atomic matter, sometimes to the \"critical mass\" stage of transmutation, such as that associated with thermonuclear explosions or implosions. Meanwhile, the \"zero-point radiation\" (\"ZPR\") and Omni Matter inte ract at much higher force levels, yet to be fully measured. The spaces between the nuclear parts of atomic matter are comparatively so large, and the Om ni Particles so small, in relation to the average amplitude of the ZPR, that the transference of force takes place right through solid matter, carried by the Onmi Particles, as if atomic mass isn't even there. The use of the term \"zero-point\" is generally used to describe a system which is in equilibrium According to physicist J. A. Wheeler1, the density of \"zero-point energy\" in vacuum-sp ace is 1094 gram/cm3. (Note; This is purportedly the density of a cubic centimeter, and if correct, tr anslates into humongous potential energy, right in the space at the tip of your nose.) I view \"energy\" purely as a potential, rather than something having an actual physical existence, as asserted by Einstein. I think Wheeler did likewise, since his measurement applied to the energy of \"zero point radiation\", no t to the Relativist concept, \"zero point energy\". Since I also am an adherent to the wave theory of light (rather than the \"corpuscular\" theory, or a contradictory combination of the two), I refer to the \"omnidirectionally interpenetrating radiation\" contained in \"equilibrated\" space, not as \"zero-point energy \" (\"ZPE\"), but rather \"zero-point radiation\" (\"ZPR\"). I also believe a ll space is saturated with ultra fine (normally) neutral matter (which also permeates all atomic matter). I refer to this as \"Omni Matter\"; This matter is activated by electromagnetic radiation whic h is not in equilibrium, transmitting its forces through Omni Matter/space until it is absorbed by some 'atomic' matter or body. Likewise, the 1 A. Wheeler, Geometrodynamics, Academic Press [1962]. ALIENS28"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"ZPR is able to interpenetrate almost all mass, because at such high frequencies, its tiny wavelength passes between atoms without resonating with or reacting with them There is an exception. According to Tesla, so-called \"radioactive\" el ements reacting to the ZPR (are \"...targets\" continuously bombarded by \"infinitesimal bullets projected from all parts of the universe\", without which \"all radioactivity would cease\" 1 ), which is the actual source of the radiation produced by them. There's something to think about: What is the nature of the structure or status of 'radioactive' elements, which allows th em to react energetically with the ZPR? It is my belief that during a body's movement through the space surrounding our earth, the independent carriers—the Omni Matter—, possessi ng independent 'tubes of force', are unified, creating continuously extended tubes of electric a nd magnetic force, which I call \"micro-helices\", swirling in parallel, tubular pathways through the body. A resistance (called \"inertia\") is experienced by a body, against the force of movement, with a polarity of movement, as acceleration progresses. There is a buildup of mome ntum (due to the very same mechanism as inertia). The inertia-resistance/momentum-perpetuation is encountered only with an increase or decrease in velocity, forcing the stubborn micro-helices into a different pitch (angle of turns) and frequency (turns per distance) of swirling electromagnetism, for each different velocity. There is no friction at a constant velocity, at which the ether \"gives back\" what it \"takes\". As proof of this concept, the process can be re versed. By placing some paraffin in a \"triax box\", with a magnetic field of 10,000 gauss, the at oms of the medium are magnetically aligned, or 'polarized'. A high frequency electromagnetic fiel d at 90 degrees, tuned to the nuclear magnetic resonance (\"NMR\") frequency of hydrogen...42.6 MHz..., excites the medium. This permits the hydrogen to react with the ZPR, to produce a (rad ioactive) beam of gamma radiation, which is far above the frequency one should expect from hydrogen. One can produce an output of electromagnetic radiation, magnetism, electric curr ent, or \"electromagnetic momentum\", depending on the particular arrangement used and output pref erred. With a hovering saucer, the electric field is externalized, with a current passing radially from the top center, across the predominantly horizontal area, and down the sides of the ship. A magnetic field automatically appears at 90 degrees to the electric field, and mass propulsion occurs on the third (vertical) axis, as utilized in Hall effect pumps. The downwardly directed beams of radiation seen on flying saucers may be due to the production of temporary radioactive isotopes of extremely short half lives, which emit photons as they return to their ground states. Since a permanent magnet is composed of a medium (iron, usually) which has been magnetically aligned or polarized, some of the in terpenetrating ZPR is arre sted and separated into electric and magnetic components, and converted into magnetic flux, which is really a kind of \"radioactivity\". The ZPR is the driving force behi nd this flux, which is strongest when aligned with the earth's magnetic field, which in turn has polarized and converted some of the ZPR near or in the earth. The force of the flux will in turn separate moving positive and negative electric charges, more or less as the reciprocal of the mechanism by which the force of the ZPR has been diverted to create the magnetic flux. A permanent magnet can also be thought of as a \"magnetic flux superconductor\", which like an ultra high frequency antenna, receives the ZPR and produces a magnetic flux. 1 Nikola Tesla, Letter, New York Times [Feb. 6, 1932], p. 16, col. 8. ALIENS29"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Use of permanent magnets by Tesla, across a spark gap discharge, was intended to use the Hall Effect to break the discharge, by separating the positive and negative charges, in order to produce a more perfect sine wave. Inadvertently, Tesla discovered that electric spark discharges in air, ignite and combust atmospheric oxygen a nd nitrogen, producing 12-million-volt waves. The oxygen and nitrogen, both, below atomic number 19, are thereby transmuted into alpha and beta charges (stripped helium nuclei with +2 charge ea., and electrons with -1 charges ea) by the powerful radiation produced, having a voltage potentia l of 12 Mev. Since this is almost three times the Mev level of gamma radiation emitted by radium, it is certainly sufficient to explain the claims of Tesla, as traditional contemporary physics cannot explain such high voltages or radiation. In an ancient application of this same principle, there were ceremonies carried out in the underground kivas of American Indian tribes in the southwest. Small, white, hand-held, rounded quartz boulders (around 2 lbs. ea.), were held in pairs, by each of a circle of men, and struck together in the dark, to produce powerful electric spark discharges. Such rocks were called \"thunder stones\" by the Southwestern Indians. You may notice some similarity to the Norse myth of Thor (\"Hare\", meaning Osiris), with his hammer. This similarity was not coincidental, since the Indians called the Great White Hare Waban, an incarnation of the eastern dawn that brings light 1 (which comports with the Norse Odin and Saxon Wotam, literally meaning \"east dawn \"). The spark discharges produce bright light, and when many are simultaneously struck together, it is enough to light up the kiva, just as the Zuni (\"Sun-of-Nu\") Ahayuda' (\"East-Hare (of) Light[ning]\") was thought to do. The Zuni war god can only be carved from the trunk of a cottonwood tree which has been struck by lightning, and a lightning bolt is displayed on the carvings. The same thing holds true for the Assyrian (\"East-Hare-People\" or \"Aryan\") Ahuramazda (\"East-Hare-of-Good-Light\"), the carvings of which also display lightning bolts. During these southwestern Indian ceremonies, the unmistakable smell of ozone fills the air, and perhaps the \"laughing gas\" produced by the sparks, which ignite oxygen and nitrogen and form nitrogen oxide, makes one giddy, euphoric, and intoxicated.. VIII: Thor's Model T Coil In my 1979 search for scientific salvage, I found a Peiltochterkompass (German, for \"Polar-Slave-Compass\"), in a pile of salvage fr om Sandia Base, in Albuquerque, which turned out to be classified salvage sold to a private dealer, who had bought the stuff without knowledge that the government employee had stolen it from a classified salvage heap at Sandia Base, then sold it for his own profit. The device was part of the celestial or inertial guidance system developed by the Germans in 1943, for navigational use on the Kreisel Teller (German tor \"Gyrating-Plate\"), more popularly known as the \"flying saucer\". Also in th at pile of classified sa lvage, was an old Ford Model T ignition coil (an invention of Tesla), along wi th a couple of the kind of ignition coils used in chemistry labs. In retrospect, I have decide d that the Peiltochterkompa ss and other items may have been clues placed there inte ntionally, and that perhaps someone expected me to interpret their use. I have a hunch as to who that \"some one\" may have been—perhaps an old friend from long ago—but I won't dare to mention the name he re. The ignition coils suggested ignition of the 1 Iron Thunderhorse, The Mysterious Dawnlanders, ANCIENT AMERICAN [Jul y/Aug,, Sept/Oct, 1997], Issue #19/20 ALIENS30"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"two or more chemical components—such as oxygen and nitrogen—to create a nuclear/electromagnetic reaction from elements commonly existing in the atmosphere. The Model T coil is an interesting gadget, since it contains a Tesla coil, combined with capacitor and a 'Faraday buzzer', which converts D.C, current fr om the battery into high voltage negative pulses. The Faraday buzzer was a substitute for a spark gap. All feat is needed for operation is a battery. Tesla may have powered his prototype flying saucer with a battery powered Model T coil, and may in fact have originally developed the Model T coil for that specific purpose. Tesla would often invent a particular gadget for his saucer, then 'turn it around' and market it for ready cash when needed, in uses more adaptable to fee relatively arch aic technology of th e contemporary market place of his day. In 1948, when I was ten years old, I belonged to a 'ham' radio club. I built a ham transceiver and had my Morse code up to speed for the qualification test, but was disappointed to learn that, at that time, under federal law, I could not take the test or operate my transceiver until I was 16. Consequently, a more startling fact I discovered, was the federal law prohibiting use of a Model T coil with a spark gap. The law app eared to come into existence co ntemporaneously to flying saucer technology, and the coil produces a series of nega tive pulses. The conversion formula indicates that it might be adequate to propel a small, man-carryin g saucer, such as the ear ly electrical prototypes in which Tesla ventured out of his New York City hotel window at night, making nocturnal excursions over the city in a machine he called his \"flivver\" machine, which was described as being about the size of a \"gas stove\"1. This astoni shing scenario must have been what scared the hell out of the oil companies . Most researchers have erroneously associated Tesla's \"flivver\" machine to the VTOL-type airplane which he patented in 1928. When we observe a hovering saucer on a windle ss day or night, a large electrical flame is often apparent, spreading around the saucer, and gr owing in size the longer fee saucer remains in one spot. This is because the initial high voltage 'leaders'—like electrical spider webs—begin to break away from the saucer's surface, ionizing and igniting oxygen-nitrogen combustion in the atmospheric gasses. Many observers mistakenly be lieve that the these 'lights' must represent electrical losses from the saucer power system, but this is inaccura te, since the saucers' electric discharges are only the \"matches', which ignite the gasses, which in turn burn so brightly. On windy nights, saucers hovering high in the sky flicker like candles in the wind, from the action of the wind periodically blowing the corona flames around on the hull. In a quiet and windless sky, the saucers may hover with a steadier, brighter glow, which is similar in appearance to, but distinguishable from a star, by a skilled observer. All the visible phenomena of saucers are consistent wife this analysis. IX: Work and Energy The saucer propulsion system appears to operate \"over unity\", as a \"free energy\" device. The \"Law of Conservation of Energy\" is said to be \"violated\" by a device which operates \"over unity\", but this interpretation is false when properly analy zed, especially when considered in the light of devices which utilize fuels or forces already existing in ambient reality, to perform work. In fact, all 1 Microfilm letter, Nikol a Tesla to Westinghouse Co., July 7, 1912, Library of Congress. ALIENS31"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"energy processes are ultimately derived from \"ZPR\", but the great majority of ordinary processes used in the 'archaic technology' forced on us by the coercive monopolists, waste so much energy that they operate well below unity. The false interpretation of the law of conservation of energy becomes obvious, when going from weak gravitational to stronger electric and electromagnetic, or even nuclear reactions. The question seems to hinge on a definition of \"fuel\", its origin, and in what form does the fuel for a particular reaction enter into an event. Th ere are several forms of 'fuel' which appear to have been intentionally obs cured. Just exactly how does a permanent magnet remain \"energized\", without any obvious fuel or \"input energy\"? Formal physics plays with words, accepting certain definitions of \"energy\", then cancel ing those definitions selectively in the case of such things as magnets. Energy is defined as \"...the ability to do work\", and the accepted formula is that \"work equals force times distance\". We know that a stronger force will do a greater amount of work on a body over a given period of time, than a weaker force will. The \"law\" is not violated, where one converts a weaker force into a stronger one, and does a gr eat deal more work, even though there are usually losses in conversions, and even though no more 'c onventional' energy is added to the process. A powerful rare earth magnet will do more work th an a conventional iron one, especially since the electric field required to cancel such a strong fiel d is much greater, and this will be a measure of the output. Fools will immediately blabber that \"...this is impossible, because it violates the law of conservation of energy\", and that there is a 'diffe rence' between \"force\" and \"energy\". Really? Then why do they fail to delineate just exactly what that alleged 'difference' is, and how the 'force' of a magnet is any different than any other force which does work? They are fundamentally wrong in this case. In 1963, a physics professor told me that a magnet \"did no work\" when it pulled a steel ball across a table top. The force moved a body (the ball) over a distance. The work performed, measurable in standard units of \"energy\", conf ormed to an accepted definition of \"energy\", the same one used by the physics professor in class. I rejected the tortured route of false reasoning intended to counteract my statem ent of the above, and the physics professor was exasperated. A weaker force—the alleged 'gravity' force be tween the iron in the magnet, and the steel ball—would not have pulled the ball across the table top. The weaker G force was dominated by the stronger magnetic force. Gravity also does wo rk (remember Niagra Falls?). There are large discrepancies in supposed applications of the \"laws of physics\", yet it is generally agreed that \"energy can be neither created nor destroyed, but only changed in its form\". This statement is completely consistent to the \"free energy hypothesis\". We know that ZPR exists in a volume of vacuumized space, also filled w ith ether, otherwise a vacuum t ube would not allow discharges. This applies to the space all around us here on ear th, together with around 26 atmospheric gasses. We have the gasses and atomic matter, in additi on to naturally existing ZPR and Omni matter, to work with, requiring only that we use appropriate means to simply convert th e weaker forces to the stronger ones, rendering them \"usable\". In reiterati on, we only need to polarize the radiant effects and separate and extract heat, other radiation, pressu re changes, electric content, or magnetism, to do work. As a \"magnetic flux superconductor\", a common magnet most likely collects the ZPR in something like a 'reversed' K-capture phenomenon, and converts it to magnetic flux. ALIENS32"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"The use of permanent magnets to produce electricity in 'over unity' devices, has not yet realty come into its own. The (Hans) Coler \"Stromerzeuger\" 1 (a \"magnetic flux device\", developed 1926-45) was a step in the right direction, and might have produced enough electricity to power a saucer, since the conversion constant shows a sm all current should suffice. It was not taken under development by O.K.M. until Jan. 4, 1943, too late for the Kreiselleller-p2 Projekt, which appeared to use a helium reactor, and the German saucers had been flying since as early as 1936. Atoms of iron are a 'medium' which have a pecu liar capacity to capture and convert ZPR into magnetic flux, which is always a secondary product of current. This means a magnet polarizes and unifies the tubes of force associated with the independent ether carriers. In the manufacture or formation of magnets—either in industry or in nature—the atoms (or molecules) of very hot or molten iron, which are in a state of flux, are a ligned by an external ma gnetic field or electric current, whereupon the atoms are cooled and 'frozen' in aligne d state, in a semi-permanent population inversion. Since the magnetic field remains when the external electric or magnetic field is removed, a magnet exists in an unbalanced relati onship, 'needing' an electric field or current to accompany it. This imbalance continues because th e magnet apprehends the magnetic portion of the ZPR, exposing its electrical portion, disturbing its equilibrium, wherever magnetic flux permeates. By alternating a magnetic field perpendicu lar to a pole-piece, or alternating an electrical current at right angles to a pole piece, an iron core will oscillate magnetically, producing rising, saturating, falling, and reversing magnetic flux which may then be used to create alternating current in inductance windings. The potential for these processes to operate ova unity is not generally understood or accepte d, though there are numerous ways to operate electric and magnetic devices in ways violative of the law of conservation of energy, according to the version misinterpreted by the power cartels and their dupes in the field of science. It stands to reason that if energy is the \"a bility to do work\", and work equals \"force over distance\", that energy equals \"force over time\". These distinctions have been obliterated and concealed by the Illuminati, which has taught us to view energy as something which comes out of a gas tank and is \"used up\" X: Forces and Fields All forces create fields, and vice-versa. Some fields in nature may be unknown in specific detail. For example, we know that certain crystals can alter the frequency of radiation (the \"Raman effect\"), but some aspects of the process remain unexplained. Electric and magnetic fields, in relation to aligned crystalline molecular structure, are the known fields involved. Since I have not fully developed my opinions regarding crystals and sub-atomic physics, I say no more in this respect, except that crystals generally appear to be transducers of electromagnetic radiation. Crystals are indeed fascinating and of scientific importance and interest, but have nothing to do with saucer propulsion. Beware of being side-tracked by huxters spewing slyly false OSI propaganda, designed to divert you into pseudo-scientific theories of crystals, so you will neglect your pursuit of saucer propulsion secrets.

Private citizens can do experiments with a minimum of equipment, with exciting prospects. It is often assumed that government/corporate scientis ts have already explored all possibilities, and that we would know of any important discoveries. But just think about it Patent protection lasts only 17 years. Is some corporation which has existed for over 100 years, going to disclose a discovery which will put itself out of business, liberate people from its power, and render its mineral assets practically worthless, in only 17 years, when they have already projected their future earnings from fossil fuels for at least the next 100 years? How else to guarantee perpetual oligarchic, socio-economic monopoly, acquire and hold ready-made mineral fuels and derived chemicals, while shutting off all avenues of alternative energy, chemicals, and raw materials? The cartels will riot sit idly by while some \"two-bit inventor\" produces and markets a device which will demolish their business in 5 years, but will move by hook or crook to nip it in the bud. They will continue to get away with it, as they always have, unless we prevent it and break the cycle of abuse. The only way we can beat them is to make free energy inventions publically available, and pass our technology all around, so th at everyone can use it. Otherwise, they will hunt down the information and destroy it, along with its authors. It is indeed ironic, that the inventor's desire to protect his discovery through secrecy, a nd the patent office's required secrecy, enables a corporate \"stainless steal\". There is no protection in the law for an inventor of such a device, so it just as well be given to everyone. As stated in Chapter I, the inventor should make a discovery public domain, to nullify any future corporate th eft, and to manufacture and sell the invention, rather than go through an exhaustive patent ap plication providing the cartels with advance notice enabling them to steal the discovery through the patent office. Was it not the failure to reproduce and spread valuable knowledge everywhere, which was the greatest mistake of the ancient library at Alexandria? Where the greatest knowledge of the ancient world was collected and virtually concealed in one pl ace, practically all of it was destroyed there, by religious fanatics. This destruction set human technology back about 1500 years, and paved the way for the Dark Ages, during which the only people allowed to possess, develop, or experiment with advanced scientific knowledge were the al chemists, who were exclusively employed by the ruling elite and bound by secrecy. Those who violated these boundaries were burned at the stake or impaled as witches or sorcerers. Today they are pr osecuted into insanity or oblivion by the FCC. Has anything really changed? Let's change it. Spread all your secrets. Small and non-energy-related inventions can be successfully patented and marketed without Dluminati interference, so long as they represent only a tiny fraction of the marketplace. Anything dealing with energy or transpor tation however, will be met with severe suppression and theft by the cartels.

It is time for us to spread all the suppressed technology we know of among the people, and to concentrate on manufacturin g durable goods of high quality, just the sort of things the cartels hate. Inventors should devo te their time spreading, trading and acquiring advanced, free energy technology, developing and initiating production techniques and creating facilities, as quickly as possible. We should also avoid La La Land-type pseudo-science of the type \"encouraged\" by the Illuminati. Some will jeer that, if we have such technolo gy, why aren't we using it? I've got news for these naive people. We are using it, and they ar e using it, but the public doesnt know it. In addition, we are paying for it, while the public service cartels pretend to be generating power with conventional technology, and are being unjustly enriched. A secret free energy system was built into our public electric utility system, by Nikola Te sla. We pay the cartels for electricity picked up 'along the way' to our houses, from the earth-ionospheric source, by the poles, and from the ZPR and Omni matter source, by the electromagnetic fields around the transmission lines. Even more current is generated by the meter on the sides of our houses (a Tesla invention which will function as a meter, a generator, or a meter and generator), depending on the particular equipment and hookups used. This secret is so well guarded that even few high ranking public service employees are aware of it. If the kilowatt hours used in a region serviced by certain generators were accurately calculated, the total usage would probably far exceed the power produced by the generator stations. We are told by the 'experts' that energy is lost, but Tesla said otherwise. Each power pole is an antenna, having a copper grounding plate underneath it, and adds electric power from the earth-ionospheric source, to the power grid. At y our house, the electric meter generates even more power, as it also reads your \"consumption\". With certain alterations, a Tesla electric meter can generate as much power as you consume and it can measure, perhaps ev en more. Differently oriented, the electric meter was orig inally one of Tesla's secret inve ntions, used as an extrernely over-unity fee energy generator, rather than a meter. I have tested this, and I know it weeks. Tesla's statement as to its potential output was so large that I won't mention it, for fear you would call him a \"nut\". These inventions are based on standard free energy or ether theory. Radiation and matter exist in a state of self-restoring equilibrium in which a ll reactions tend to equal zero, with equilibrium being self-restored when disturbed This tendency to become restored is related to the energy potential existing in fee space, being a property of all matter and radiation. Since free universe is a perpetual motion system, energy, per se, does not exist, and all \"work\" is done by perpetual universal forces which exist in the environment. Radiation does not move through space, bu t is the result of electrical and magnetic disturbances from stored sources emanating into the zero-point system at various points, which activate and polarize the normally neutral Omni Matter, causing transmission in chain reactions, carrying the electromagnetic oscillations from a multitude of points A, to a multitude of points B. The Omni Matter is so fine that it is capable of super-transmitting electromagnetic disturbances, from particle to particle, at all frequencies, simulta neously, in all directions, while self-restoring is own equilibrium. If we conceive of Omni Matter as tiny, identical globes composed of intertwined positive and negative bundles of electromagnetic force in equilibrium, densely packing all space like grains of sand, while ZPR simultaneous ly vibrates through it in all directions, it is possible to understand how equilibrium is main tained by the omnidirectipnal ZPR, and how ALIENS35"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"equilibrium can be upset. The equilibrium is upset by polarization of this omnidirectional vibratory mode, and 'energy' (the exertion of force through distance) may be extracted from or injected into the Omni Matter and the ZPR, via a proper medium of exchange. What one may perceive as \"light, moving th rough space\", is an electromagnetic fluorescent reactance of matter, as the forces excite it at particular visible frequ encies related to the fluorescence-frequencies of the surface atoms of illuminated visible objects. The trick is to disturb the equilibrium with a minimum of input, then to appropriate the 'restoring' energy, on a continuous basis. Lo w frequency electromagnetic forces which are transmitted into the system, are transmitted through it very efficiently. Whenever the frequency is increased until it creates disturbances in atomic matter-tending to re-establish its equilibrium—\"atomic energy\" may be produced. The potential for matter to be \"worked upon\" by electric, magnetic or nuclear force, is called \"energy\". Whenever a physical body is forced against another body, electromagnetic reactions, binding, a ttracting and repelling forces between the atoms and molecules of the bodies are stressed The objec t with the greater momentum usually forces the other body to move or to come apart. On the microscopic level, force is imparted electromagnetically. \"Energy\" is al ways an abstract future con tingency, which has no present existence in physical form. It is not a substance, and cannot be equated with a substance, but is a property of atomic, electric, magnetic, or electromagnetic radiation and reactions, which occur under certain conditions. In order for the equilibrated forces of ZPR an d matter to be synthetically apprehended for the performance of useful work, a quantity of speciall y chosen matter (or 'medium') may be placed in a \"triaxial box\", and subjected to electric, magnetic, or electromagnetic forces (emphasizing that so-called thermal or nuclear forces are really material reactions to electromagnetic forces). A confusion between \"energy\" and \"force\", in conjunction with a false interpretation of the law of conservation of energy by their scientific dupes, allows the Trilateralists/CFR/Illuminati to conceal free energy and Super Gr avity technology secret s from us. We no longer need for them to tell us the 'secrets', because th e secrets are out. We must appr ehend and use this technology to throw off the parasitic CFR. Nikola Tesla's discovery of high frequency radiation and its use in the flying saucer, was his greatest contribution to the world. An oscillati ng electromagnetic wave has a frequency, which is the number of \"beats\" per second, with which th e electromagnetic force is delivered. Within a system, an increase in frequency also increases th e voltage or force of each beat, yet this requires no greater power to do so. Visualize a person beating a rug with a certain force, at the rate of one stroke per second. Now visualize that person bearing the rug 10 times per second, at twice the force. Naturally, the results for a given time will be greater, yet with electromagnetic radiation, no greater power is required to deliver 20 megahertz, than 20 kilohertz, yet the force (voltage) of the former, is greater per beat, as well as the number of blows per second. It is this phenomenon which causes the power radiated by an oscillating electrom agnetic dipole, to increase at the fourth power of its increase in frequency. This is called the \"reactance\", and it is exactly what Tesla had in mind when he announced the completion of some tests of his electromagnetic (saucer) propulsion system, in 1940, though he tested it as early as \"many years\" before 1912, to be specific, in 1894. I call mis system \"Super Gravity\". It is \"public domain\", because of its unpatented secret use by the government for over one year.

I use the 'other dimension' reference only because fifty years of brainwashing has obliterated human c onsciousness of it and many other things in reality. I present it that way to soften the initial effects of faci ng reality.

ALIENS39"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Application of the Hall Effect The above outline of theories shows the 'questio ns' of ether and gravity by no means settled, but it is my theory that a more or less complete and correct ether theory, based primarily on Tesla's theory, is possessed and used by the Secret Government, which developed and propagated Relativism to fill the void of the missing theory, in order to conceal and preserve ether physics for their exclusive use, while preventing the technology from damaging their interests under national security orders which prohibit us from using it. Otherwise, why would Tesla's 100- year-old theory still be classified? This concealment can be documented by a cons picuous lack of clarity and completeness in the use of such principles as the Hall effect to propel act only fluids, but solid masses, since it seems to apply to flying saucer propulsion. While I have found at least one group of patents for propulsion systems based on the Hall effect, the inventions inappropriately use the Hall effect only to pump air and electrons, not the ether, in a circuitous route only a few inches between electrodes. They missed the point entirely, which seemed to be the point of the patents, to discredit the Hall Effect as a viable application to propulsion. With the Hall effect, the pulsing of electric inpu t, rather than a steady D.C. current, increases the output. 1 This is consistent with the increase in el ectromagnetic reactance, at the fourth power of the increase in frequency. Tesla was therefore able to use his coil to produce \"pseudo- electrostatic\", D.C. pulses, which are not high frequency A.C., to produce his brush. As determined by Nikola Tesla in his tests 2 , at sufficiently high frequency and voltage, the ether (\"Omni Matter\") becomes \"solid state\", which means that it behaves similar to a solid mass under such circumstances. This obviously tended to confirm Faraday's theory of an \"electric, elastic, solid ether\" (solid to heat and light, bu t which allowed solid bodies to pass through). Tesla stressed the space between two electrified plates, in his original experiment s, and also explored \"unipolarity\" of a single electrode or plate, as on a flying saucer surface, as it reacts with space and other matter. Tesla's tests of a saucer by 1915, tended to confirm his theory (along with the subsequent theories of J. J. Thomson and Willia m Thomson), as it applied to electro-propulsioa The surface of a saucer draws in the tubes of forc e, which are dissolved in the conductor creating a propulsive force which is 10 40 times stronger that the G-force constant, to provide the motive force. This is no more than a juxtaposition of th e Hall effect as used in magneto-hydro-dynamic (\"M.H.D.\") generators and pumps. Since the rigidified Omni Matter is ultra fine, it can pass into the attracting surface, carrying the tubes of force into the mass, where they are fo rced to dissolve by the high frequency 'blocking' current on the other end, leaving the Omni to pass through the body of the saucer and everything in it, and out the other side, with the only perc eptible effects being accele ration of mass and the creation of momentum in the saucer and its contents. All physical bodies are 'saturated' with Omni Matter, and their atoms and molecules 'fly throug h' the Omni Matter like a flock of geese fly through the air. A better conception of what is happening with a flying saucer can be visualized by loosely analogizing it to a squid, which sucks water in one end and squirts it out the other like a jet, 1 Hall Effect Manual. Beckman Instruments, Inc., Helipot Division, Fuller ton, California (1963). 2 T.C. Martin (supra). ALIENS40"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"propelling the squid through the water, with the ex ception that the saucer experiences no internal turbulence or pressure. With saucer propulsion, the Omni Matter is stationary in respect to the universe, but dynamic in respect to the earth a nd matter of which the saucer is composed. The saucer moves through the rigidified, \"meta-so lid\" ether permeating it, by pulling and pushing against it, by use of the Hall effect. By forcing the ether to move through the saucer, the saucer moves through it. This movement is obtained by inducing the tubes of electric and magnetic force to enter the saucer surface, then stripping them away to impart momentum to the conductive parts of the ship, as the Omni pass on through where they acquire new tubes after they exit the ship's posterior. The ether carriers are exchanged through the saucer's electrified surf ace, behaving like a fluid mass capable of entering into the surface and passing through the saucer as it moves, leaving behind the momentum which is the product of the dissolved tubes of force, in satisfaction of the \"equal and opposite' force rule. The internal contents of the saucer are not adversely affected, since it is \"internally\" accelerated at the same rate, in th e same direction, instantly, by the dissolved tubes of force. The electromagnetic force pumps the et her which creates the tubes of force (\"micro- helical tubes\") through the mass of the saucer. These tubes are the source of inertia, momentum, polarity and precession, and can be turned on, off, or re-oriented instanta neously, to accelerate, decelerate, or change the saucer's direction instantaneously. The reaction between normal solid matter and the ether with its tubes, generates and gives rise to inertia/momentum, and gravitational effects. The effects of such sudden changes on objects and people inside the saucer are canceled with the re-creation of new effects inside the conductors, as the tubes of force are dissolved in them, which insulates the ship's contents from the effects of the tubes. Normally, the individual ether carriers, possessing individual tubes of force terminating on them, create a resistance (\"inertia\") to changes in rate of acceleration or direction of a body. As the body is forced through space, the individual tubes of force are united, enter, and are dissolved in the moving body, tending to perpetuate its movement (\"momentum\") in its direction of travel, at 90 degrees to the tubes of force and the generated current, resisting changes to the state of motion The micro-helices are of approximate atomic diameter, have pitch (angle of momentum) and angular velocity (at C, which means the saucer may only move at a maximum percent of the velocity of light). At a constant velocity, the micro-helices are without friction, according to the principle I call \"The Law of Conservation of Perpetual Motion\", which means that, with the micro-helices in parallel motion, the mass of the body reacts with the ether and ZPR in such a way as to counteract any internal friction. This is the reason that, at a constant velocity, when the micro-helices resist changes in pitch, momentum, or polarity—analogous to inductance phenomena—there is no inertia (internal 'friction' ca used by changes in orientation or pitch of the micro-helices). If the body encounters external fo rce which acts to slow it down, the momentum of the micro-helices tends to conserve the motion, by 'screwing' each of the atoms in the 'micro-helical tubes' forward, along their polarized, parallel ax es. The normal acceleration of a body through the ether creates the electromagnetic conditions originating the momentum, and which are synthesized by saucer electro-technology, in which both momentum/inertia is switched, and the saucer turned on a dime by reorienting the electromagnetic polarity and momentum. Using the method discovered by Tesla, under sp ecial circumstances created by \"p2\", the potential of the ether to react as a continuous, elec trically conductive, rigidified elastic fluid, is revealed, in respect to the negatively charge d saucer surface and mass. The high frequency, high ALIENS41"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"voltage negative pulses, carried by the saucer su rface in one direction, create a magnetic field across the surface at 90 degrees to the current, causing the mass of the saucer to accelerate in a direction normal to the surface (at 90 degrees to th e current and magnetic field), according to the Hall effect, as the ether carriers and tubes of force are pumped through the criss-crossing electric and magnetic fields on the saucer surface, where th e tubes of force are separated from the ether carriers and dissolved in the conductors, as the stripped ether carriers pass on through the saucer mass, and out the other side (as in an MHD pump), where they acquire new tubes of force. The total electromagnetic force, which is 10 40 times stronger than the G force, 1 accelerates the ship at fantastic speed. All of the normal inertia/mom enturn forces in space are manipulated by the saucer's powerful electromagnetic effects, by being forcibly \"eaten up\" on one end, with the saucer's movement being the \"equal and opposite\" effect.. There is a deceptive effect of the so-called gravity force, which makes it appear to 'penetrate' mass under normal conditions. This is demonstrated by holding one body above the ground, with a second body held above it. The G force appears to 'go through' the lower body, to pull the second, upper body down, with the force apparently not being blocked by the lower body. The force appears to be linear, penetrating, and undimini shed and unblocked by other mass. These false appearances (what Einstein called \"apparent effects\"), are in real ity a natural deception, resulting from the tendency to falsely assume that gravity is a force exerted at a distance through \"empty space\" between the bodies, by mysterious, unknown characteristics endemic to the bodies (in the absence of Ether Physics), when in fact, the fo rce is exerted between the bodies and the ether existing in and between all bodies, due to the elect rostatic ('microwave') inleractance created in the interpenetrating ether rigidified by these forces. As stated by Tesla 2 , \"...But place a gaseous (or liquid) column in an intense, rapidly alternati ng electrostatic field set the particles vibrating with enormous speeds, then the inertia resistan ce asserts itself. A body might move with more or less freedom through the vibrating mass, but as a whole it would be rigid.\" Obviously, if the G force is so infernally weak in comparison to the electromagnetic force, it is scarce wonder that it could not really be such a \"penetrating\" one, where it would take an X-ray of several million volts to penetrate the two bodies. The force is exerted linearly between a smaller body and the earth, on the ether within each body, because the earth's electric field of influence has rigidified the ether, displaced it, and upset the equilibrium in the vicinity of the two bodies, which requires the smaller body's movement toward the center of the earth, as an equal and opposite reaction to the electrostatic forces. The movement of a smaller body in space above the earth, and within its field of influence, upsets the equilibrium of the ether, and pumps it upward through the smaller body, due to the electrostatic forces generated in the body and the earth by their movement through space. The tubes of force are unified and drawn into the smaller body and dissolved in it, thus accelerating the body downwar d, which is called \"gravity\", and erroneously thought to be a mysterious \"attraction\" between the two bodies. The masses and movements of certain bodies in relative proximity, cause their electrostatic effects on the ether in their vicinity, to accelerate the bodies toward one another, almost as if they 1 The Electromagnetic Interaction (supra). 2 Nikola Tesla, Experiments with Alternate Currents of High Potential and High Freque ncy (a lecture delivered before the Institution of Electrical Engineers, London, 1892) ALIENS42"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"were one body. Gravity and inertia/momentum involve electromagnetic polarization created by special unipolar electromagnetic (electrostatic mi crowave) radiation, resulting from disturbance of the ether and its ZPR transmissive characteristics. Wi th every change in the axis of polarization of a body at rest or in motion, inertia/momentum must be overcome. Do these forces, once magnified by this technology, represent a danger similar to X-ray? The answer appears to be paradoxical, in that gravity is not really 'penetrating 1 anything, but is only a reaction within and between atomic matter and the ether which does penetrate everything. While the high voltage emissions on the exterior of a saucer obviously represent a type of danger, the internal contents may be quite safe, due to adequate shielding and insulatioa Th rough common sense, injury should be avoided The deceptive apparent effects have thwarted our attempts to understand that inertia, centrifugal force, and momentum are all created by the same interaction between atomic mass, ZPR and ether within or near a mass, as the mass moves (since all mass is in motion). On our planet, the electric field of influence dominates that of other smaller bodies in its proximity, including the moon, just as the sun's electric field dominates that of the planets in the solar system as a whole, etc. Being within earth's electric fi eld means that the characteristics of the ether and ZPR have been polarized displaced rigidified to some degree, and otherwise altered and extended for some distance around it, so that on a macroscopic scale, bodies are made to behave as if they were a part of the earth's mass, or earth's mass system. The solar system is similar to a giant atom. Under special 'synthetic' electromagnetic conditions, the characteristics of the medium (ether and ZPR) as the source of inertia/momentum, are altered increased or canceled as one chooses, instantaneously. The normal requirement that such forces must be mechanically counteracted is circumvented by electromagnetically re-polarizing the forces within a body as it moves through the natural medium, in the direction desired In order for a body to overcome the earth's gravity, an alteration of the same ether/ZPR reactions which are occurring within the ma ss of the earth, must be reversed within that body. The polarity of the momentum can be synthetically oriented in any desired direction, and increased or decreased as the body's electric field can be magnified (to mimic that of a much larger bod y), canceled (diminished to that of a non-existent body), or adjusted to whatever level and in whatever direction desired. In so doing, the effects of earth's electrostatic forces are overcome by forces create d from within a relatively tiny body, due to the gravitational-to-electromagnetic force conversion c onstant which allows it to be much stronger. Though gravity, like X-rays, app ears to penetrate mass even more than X-rays, this is a misperception. Gravity causes no known damage to organic life as X-rays do, since the reactions between mass, ether, and ZPR are non-interactive in the frequencies of nuclear or molecular ionization of our organic bei ngs, on our saucer, except on its surface, and create no reactions internally which could result in radioactive or ganic damage. These reactions are controlled by superficially applied electrostatic force, which affects the interpenetrating ether, without altering internal nuclear structures or organic life. Microwaves do not ordinarily penetrate meta llic surfaces. Ether and ZPR permeate all mass, operating in a different way. X-rays are damaging to cell life, while gravity is not, affecting mass in a non-radioactive way, by conditions created by the natural electromagnetic resonance of all gravitational bodies. The microwaves measured by Tesla, emanating from the earth, are generated by its movement through space, as a result of earth's mass and electrical c ontent, cutting through lines of sun's magnetic field The driving force behind earth's movement through space, is the giant current passing from the sun, through space, through the earth, and back to the sun, which ALIENS43"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"imparts momentum to the earth 1 , by drawing tubes of force into the earth through the Aurora Borealis (earth's 'brush'), wher e they are dissolved. Norwegian Astrophysicist Hannes Alfven recounted how Kristian Birkeland's measurements showed that \"...magnetic fields generated by the aurora are so localized on the ground that they can only have been produced by nearly vertical currents—aligned along the magnetic field of the earth..\" 2 As Eric Lerner explained, Alfven discovered that plasma clouds moving in th e magnetic field of the sun, generate electric currents which flow to the sun, after which giant currents, with trillions of amps, flow out of the sun along solar magnetic field lines, into the earth's aurora, through the earth, back through the cloud, and back to the sun at its equator, and so forth, transferring momentum to the earth. An oscillating electromagnetic dipole is always changing, and if designed properly, produces an externalized negative pulse radiating from a saucer, which, while affe cting ether and ZPR both within and without the saucer, is not destructiv e to organic life. The key is 'positive' versus 'negative' radiation. Penetrating positive radiation (such as X-ray) r eacts with nuclear mass within its frequency range, and transmutes it, while 'nega tive' radiation tends to react with the outer electronic structure of matter, and does not normally transmute nuclear mass, though the collisions of high energy electrons with nuclear mass can give rise to X-rays, by penetrating outer electron cloud barriers and entering into nuclear space, resulting in the excitation and relaxation of atoms, with the periodic emission of X-radiation. The Precession Problem Tesla's original flying saucer was apparently plagued by the problem of precession. It was for this reason that the Germans named it the \"Kre isel Teller\" (\"Gyrating [precessing] Saucer\"), which exhibited the behavior of a spinning top, especially when hovering, giving rise among speculators that the saucer's an ti-gravity properties were created somehow by gyroscopic action. The mass of a spinning object in a state of uniform (angular) momentum, possesses uniform oscillations in axial and planar polarity. The axia l polarity is uniformly precessing (rotating), while the radial polarity is also uniform ly oscillating. Is the precessive force exerted parallel to the rotational axis, or perpendicular to it? Clearly, though we are more aware of the oscillation of the spin axis, the force of precession could just as well be exerted through the plane of rotation, as a twisting force directly related to the variations in frequency of toroidal micro-helices formed within a spinning body, due to the progressive difference in velocity between the mass near the center, and that along the outside. It could be due to an undulating wave motion within the ocean of ether saturating all bodies, whic h varies in frequency and angle accord ing to the motions of individual bodies. It is related to the spinning of the tubes of force, unified and drawn from the ether into spinning bodies, and dissolved in them, and the rate at which they transfer momentum to the spinning bodies, similar to how earth's momentum is transferred from the currents in space. The hydrogen atom resonates magnetically at 42.6 million times per second. This is its \"NMR\" (Nuclear Magnetic Resonant) frequency, th e frequency at which the axial magnetic poles of the hydrogen atom precess, or oscillate. This oscillation is very fast as compared to the 1 Hannes Alfven, Existence of Electr omagnetic Hydrodynamic Wa ves, NATURE, vol. 150 [Oct. 3, 1942], pp. 405-6. 2 Eric Lerner, The Big Bang Neve r Happened, Random House [1991]. ALIENS44"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"precession of a top, yet the same rules govern bo th bodies. It would be impossible for a top to precess at 42.6 MHz., because its inertia and mass properties would cause it to disintegrate under ordinary circumstances, but the precession of its individual atoms at that frequency presents no such problem Since a rotating body absorbs the tubes of force, translating them into momentum, perhaps the oscillations of the spin axis is determined by the rate at which momentum is transferred. Generally, the difference between the precessive frequencies of the hydrogen atom and the top, appears to relate to their comparativ e masses, which have a great difference in the momentum involved. By recreating the electromagne tic effects with an internal generator in a space ship, the ship will behave as if it were a single giant ion, having specific precessive effects peculiar to that body. If the electrapulsive technolo gy puts the atoms of the ship into a sort of \"population inversion\", it is possible that the precession of th e individual atoms is transferred to the entire ship. The speculator looks for a \"spinning body\" when he observes precession, while the more intelligent thinker realizes that the precession of a large spinning body is more than likely due to a non-apparent electromagnetic effect having its origin in the reaction between the spinning atomic mass of the body, the unseen atomic matter and ZPR within the body, and the ether and tubes of force in the space in which it precesses. The phenomenon may not require a spinning body, but may be due to synthetically recreated electromagnetic reactions of a spinning body, on a non-spinning body. The precessive motion can be related to the cumulative electromagnetic effect of spinning electrons in a magnetic field, transferred as precession to the body. The electropulsion used on a flying saucer may cause it to precess as if it were spinning or contained a spinning mass, just as electromagnetic conditions cause any spinning object to precess. The precession I witnessed may have been th e result of one of Tesla's large alternators, being turned by a turbine. Since the rate and angle of precession was directly proportional to its rate of acceleration, consistent with a turb ine turning the alternator faster to generate progressively more power. Whatever the cause of the precession, it seems endemic to and problematic with the propulsion system. If an internal spinning alternator were responsible for a saucer's precession, it would be difficult to isolate the rest of the ship from the effects of its gyroscopic action, unless it were placed on gimbals. As such, it c ould be used as the \"master\" gyrocompass, to be conveniently coupled with the Peiltochterkompass, to provide the navigational necessities of the saucer. If it were bolted rigidly to the airframe, the gyroscopic action would not permit the ship to be maneuvered in the manner observed, because it would resist being turned perpendicular to its rotational axis, and could only be turned around the plane of angular momentum. It would have been impossible for a saucer to turn the 90-degree vertical angles at high speed such as I observed in 1953, even us ing the so-called \"Coanda effect\", because the angular momentum of the gyroscope would have to be entirely canceled instantaneously, and reoriented and reactivated with each such turn, and su ch a possibility coul d only be effected electromagnetically, not gyroscopically. In respect to aerodynamics, I was embarrassed for a fellow 'UFO' researcher, who claims to be a physicist, when I discovered in one of his books, that he believes that fast moving air from prop wash is \"compressed\" air with higher pres sure than surrounding air. He apparently was unaware of the fact that aerodynamic lift is created by low pressure (faster moving) air, and was further confused by the fact that fast moving air has greater propulsive force (as an 'equal and opposite' thrust reaction due to an increase in its momentum, transferred to it by an aircraft), which is the main principle of rocket and jet propulsion. In applying this misconception to a little toy ALIENS45"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"styrofoam 'UFO' which uses a model engine and propeller in its center, to suck air across the annular ring-shaped airfoil around it, to create lift as well as downward thrust, he entirely misunderstood the means by which the toy stayed aloft. In mis particular toy, the styrofoam ring to which the engine mounts are attached, is allowed to counter-rotate from the torque of the engine. This causes a certain amount of the air to be drawn along with the ring, due to molecular adhesion and viscosity. So in addition to the Bernoulli effe ct, the Magnus effect is added, to create further lift, by increasing the height and pressure drop in the burbles above the upper airfoil surface (I'm sorry, but it isn't easy to bullshit me on aerodynamics). The 'physicist' attempted to make the case that UFOs' work on the principle of \"gyroscopic action\". The problem was, both the engine and ring were rotating on the same plane, so any \"anti-gravitational\" force purportedly created by the outer mass, was counteracted by the counte r-rotating engine. He had merely discarded aerodynamics completely, and by similar reasoning, he should have claimed that helicopters, airplanes, dirigibles, and gyrocopters are all \"anti-gravity craft\", and in point of fact, did just that In my 1993 version of Space Aliens... (pg. 126), in passages written years before, I also made out a case for gyroscopic forces acting in \"semi-defian ce to gravity\", but that argument is based on the generation of excess negative charges which are su fficient to alter the gravitational reaction, but still insufficient to create \"anti-gravity\" as compared to mere weight loss. It is also probable that many aircraft gain extra lift by accumulation of excess negative charges. Were the earth's magnetic field many tunes stronger than it is, a gyroscopic device might possibly generate sufficient negative charges to defy gravity completely, but this is not the case, and the 'physicist' was unable to cite a single principle—either of 'acce pted' or 'dissident' physics—s upporting his baseless theory, though he mentioned the research of others showi ng anomalous weight loss, most likely caused electrostatically. If he based his claims on their findings, and nothing more however, he wasn't entitled to call it \"his discovery\". Oh! His discovery of their discoveries and my book. I knew that this 'physicist' had read my book (since he nastily asked me about something in it), but I have a nebulous suspicion bordering on certainty that he is a witting O.S.I. agent recruited from the KGB when the Soviet super-state fell apart, under orders to misinform the public, to counteract the potential effects of the ideas in my book, although he is possibly just another plagiaristic charlatan who wants to \"steal my thunder\", by 'taking a few ideas' and misusing them. He is frustrated by my preemption of material collected under Operation Paperclip in 1945, altered by the O.S.I., and recently disseminated in Eur ope concerning German flying saucers, which is depicted as La La Land misinformation typical of OSI liars, concocted to lure \"new-age-prone\" people away from the true theory. The dingy theories just don't hold water, and the gut feeling persists that they're the work of OSI misinforma tion squads.

He not only failed to convince me that he 'discovered anti-gravity' or is a \"dissident scientist\" as he claims, but in his apparent ignorance, failed to 'one-up' me as he intended.

It is a circuitous, eternal process, in which 'energy' can be neither created nor destroyed, only changed in form These forces continuously transmute in nature, whether or not humans use them to perform \"work\". Perpetual motion is the rule and not the exception. All energy and matter is conserved in changing forms, exchanging forces, effects, or matter, \"using nothing up\", and equaling zero. The Illuminati pseudo-scientists have labored so diligently for so long to talk us out of these obvious facts, and to convince us that we need Standard Oil of Ne w York, etc., forever, and don't you forget it!

ALIENS47"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"SYNOPSIS OF FACTS This book is related to the following list of little-known, officially suppressed, or publicly unknown facts: 1. An American citizen (naturalized), Nikola Te sla (an atheist and a capitalist), invented the flying saucer, before 1900, and reduced it to practice by 1915. 2. The American government helped the Nazis steal the invention from Tesla, through a secret 1936-38 project, at Los Alamos, New Mexico (then called the \"p2\" project), under the direction of the Baron Wernher von Braun, who was simultaneously collaborating in rocket research with Dr. Robert Goddard near Roswell funded by the American Rocket Society (The Smithsonian Institution and the Guggenheim Foundation). 3. The American government later helped Wernher von Braun, under the Nazi project (a forerunner of the Trilateral Commission) and CFR/Il luminati (who still retain control) remove the \"KT-p2\" Projekt (\"KT\" is for \"Kreisel-Teller\" [German, for \"Gyrating Plate\"], and \"p2\" is the electronic designation for Tesla's dipolar pr opulsion system) to Germany, in early 1938. 4. The Nazis, who developed and used the flying saucer during the war (called \"Foo-Fighters\" by us, \"Fireballs\", \"Flying Saucers\" [Fliegende Untertasse], and \"Flying Turtles\" by them), were unsuccessful in developing appropriate weapons for it until too late. They traded it to the U. S. government and corporations during the stalemate of 1945, in exchange for amnesty for numerous persons (including many war criminals), and for other concessions and guarantees. 5. The U.S. government (N.S.A., O.S.I.), on behalf of the Trilateral Commission/CFR, continues with and enforces a Nazi-originated \"Big Lie\" program, in which it perpetuates the hoax that flying saucers (\"U.F.O.s\") are: (a) Extrater restrial in origin; (b) psychological phenomena (\"collective consciousness archetypal images\", al a C. G. Jung); © swamp gas; (d) \"free-floating plasmas\"; (e) piezo-electric effe cts; (f) ball-li ghtning; (g) other natural phenomena; (h) unknown life forms; (I) hallucinations; (j) non-existent; (k ) hoaxes by attention-seekers; (1) the products of hysteria, insanity, etc., etc. 6. The German navy surrounded the U.S. with 24 U-boats, armed with (V-6?) I.C.B.M.S, having celestial guidance systems, and armed with neutron bomb warheads, trained on key American cities and centers, in a 1945 stalemat e; German Admiral Karl Doenitz negotiated a secret truce and amnesty agreem ent with American authorities, under which he was required to order all 24 U-boats \"...scuttled, with all hands on board...\", under the agreement, pursuant to which Nazi skippers opened the hatches and the subs and all men on board went to the bottom Under Operation Paperclip, all Nazi scientific research materials, most of their important scientists, and the \"KT-p2 Projekt\" technology, were transferred to the U.S. and to the CFR corporations, thus attempting to insure that the Illuminati would retain control of the materials. Certain unusual security procedures were initiated to insure this, including the \"sacrificing\" of some major German scientists to the Soviets, to plant misinformation, and to insure that the hoax was successful. 7. During the war, German scientists bypassed development of the \"atom bomb\", and built and tested the neutron bomb. German field Marshall Erwin Rommel and the Afrika Korps were originally sent to North Africa to test the neutron bomb, as well as Tesla's \"death ray\" (which freezes whole armies); this technology was acquire d by American corpora tions, held chiefly by ALIENS48"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"David Rockefeller, and was later sold in part back to the U.S. government and tested in the '60s, and the same technology was again sold to the U.S. government in the \"70s and '80s, as \"Star Wars\" (\"SDI\" or \"Strategic Defense Initiative\") technology. 8. Over 15,000 German military, technical, intelligence, and support personnel were brought to America (mostly New Mexico—Manzano Base, Sandia Base, White Sands Missile Range, Alamogordo, Holloman A.F.B., Los Alamos, etc.) with the KT-p2 Project, in Sept., 1945, at which time, under Operation Paper Clip, Wernher von Braun became Director of Research, U.S. Army Ordnance, Ft. Bliss, Texas; he and his 116 top rocket and flying saucer scientists commenced rocket and flying saucer R & D. at White Sands Missile Range, and Alamogordo. 9. Howard Hughes' \"Glomar Explorer\" was built to retrieve the 24 scuttled German U-Boats, before terrorists or unfriendly governments found and retrieved the subs, missiles, bombs, and related technology. The WW II German \"Electro-U-boats\" were powered by a type of magnetic-electric generator (invented by an Americ an named Dort, of Virginia), based on a Tesla oscillator, which was superior to nuclear power. Further details about the German 'ship', the Graf Zeppelin, are included in this book; Adolf and Ev a (Braun) Hitler were da ringly rescued from the Berlin Fuehrerbunker by a flying saucer, flown by test pilot Hanna Reitsch and long distance flight expert Hans Ulrich Rudel. The Hitlers were later protected by the secret amnesty agreement, for the remainder of their lives under protection of the N.A.T.O. alliance, in Kassel, Germany, ironically the home of an international monument to the Holocaust. The Hitlers even visited Hemisfair, the World's fair at San Antonio, Texas, in 1967, on the invitation of L.B.J. 10. Part of the original deceit was under way at Wright-Patterson A.F.B, Ohio, even before the German surrender; Edgar Cayce was already empl oyed as a technical writer, to revise, adapt, and resume the propaganda work pioneered by Hans Hoerbiger, Hitler's personal guru and astrologer, the official \"father of parapsychology\", and designer of the Nazi \"Big Lie\" system, in which the public's credibility 'window' is wallowed into a giant hole, allowing the indiscriminate acceptance if faceless authority a nd whatever the government says ; the U.S. government even hired an Ohio naval law professor (and genius) to revise and popularize \"Astara\" (\"Ostara\" to Hitler), the Nazi religion based on the Bonpas (T ibetan black magic) religion, imported from Tibet to Germany by general Karl Haushofer, an ordained Bonpas priest, as the basis for the S.S., financed and set up on instructions of the British-American CFR, in 1919; the S.S. Bonpas worshipped \"Kali Ma\" (\"Bloody Mother\"). This cult founded the ancient Thugee cult of India, and was the basis for the Society of Assassins; the concepts of this weird religion related to the mass extermination of people, through many means, including assassination, extermination, and war, as the basis for all 20th century totalitarian movements. 11. Most forms of mass communication are primarily controlled or produced by the Illuminati, through the secret agencies of our government, to brainwash the public, in the most monumental hoax in history, to socio-economically control the world, and to perpetuate lies designed to obscure the flying saucer's man-made origin and use (as well as to steal and conceal or monolithically control all other advanced technolo gy); the government hires consultants, contract script writers, and teams of PhD.s, to create and disseminate Big Lie propaganda, in countless pulp magazines and newspapers, and finances and produces books and movies of the Close Encounters of the Third Kind ilk, to perpetuate the \"extraterrestrial\" myth; the government controls and manipulates the press, hires lecturers, and organizes and funds UFO groups; it stages \"abductions\", using actors, drugs, and sets; Operation Blue Book was set up at ALIENS49"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Wright-Patterson A.F.B., to retrieve leaked information and plug leaks, disseminate misinformation, falsely represent \"expert, objective, scientific opinion\", and to ferret out 'problem people'; mystical organizations (such as A.R.E.—Association for Research and Enlightenment—part of the Edgar Cayce Foundation, of Virginia Beach, Virginia [conveniently close to CIA headquarters])—are created for the same purposes, and set the stage for the type of mass psychological control of the public required for totalitarian control by mystical cults, such as \"Communism\", \"Naziism\", \"Synergy \", or \"Parapsychology\" cults. 12.

As an underlying cause of the \"Holocaust\", a proposal was made by the U.S. Government to the Treaty of Versaille Committee, in 1919. In a document known as \"Morgenthau's Pastoral Policy\", signed by president Woodrow Wilson (drafted by his Illuminati advisor, Hans Morgenthau, Sr.) and presented at Versaille. Under it, the U.S. attempted to make, as one of the provisions of the German surre nder, the extermination of all Germans, as an \"inherently warlike race\", and the \"reduction of Germany to a pastur e land\". The document, examined by me in 1968, was among the papers of former president Lyndon Baines Johnson, now kept in the Sid W. Richardson Research Center, at U.T., Austin, named for my third cousin. 15. The \"cattle mutilations\" phenomenon is an ongoing program of the CIA's Special Operations Division. 'Biological samples' are removed by specially trained flying saucer crews, from thousands of cattle grazing in remote areas , for analysis, to measure radiation-caused auto-immune-deficiency and reproductive sterilization effects, after the cattle have been subjected to irradiation by \"Death Ray\" devices under development since the '60s. Since 1979, the saucers have bombarded members of the public, under the MK-NAOMI Program of the CIA, fa- purposes of \"population control\" (i.e., exterminati on). Government scientists use special surgical devices, standard blood coagulants, and cryogenic technology, enhanced by microwave equipment, to remove the cattle blood (and ears, lips, tong ues, mammary glands, genitalia, anuses, etc.); afterward, the carcasses are returned and air-dropped from flying saucers, back into their original pastures; the mysterious circumstances are then misconstrued by government-spread rumors of \"extraterrestrials\", attributed to \"Satanist cults \" or other cults created by the government, or \"coyotes and other natural predators\", etc. (Of cour se, MAN is a \"natural predator\".)

The Antarctic \"Ozone Hole\", which U.S. govern ment scientists pretend to be at a loss to explain—yet blaming it on 'aerosol sprays'—is pr obably the by-product of three nuclear missiles, armed with hydrogen bomb warheads, which were launched from the Antarctic by the U.S. military, on Aug. 27, Aug. 30, and Sept 9, 1957. The warheads were detonated at a 300-mile altitude, to create a reflective spherical layer of ionic particles surrounding the earth, to bounce radar impulses between the layer and the earth. The Strategic Air Command's global \"backscatter\" radar system, operated from the North Ameri can Air Defense (NORAD) command center deep beneath the earth at Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado, thus became operational in 1957, in time to verify that the Russians fired the rocket which launched Sputnik. 17. The N.S.A. protracts a false \"national security\" veil, to continue concealment of flying saucer technology, creating false fears of 'rampant anarchy, 'chaos', and other exaggerations and ruses, before N.S.A. committees, to justify continued secrecy, and to continue to deny public access to or to declassify the technology.

The true scientific principles of grav ity have been misrepresented, confused, and concealed by \"Big Brother\", even in school books read by our children, just to conceal flying saucer technology, to protect the energy cartels and the mixed-economy socialist political power structure from losing its illegitimate parasitic grip on us. 19. In 1893-94, Nikola Tesla, a patriotic naturalized U.S. citizen, of Serbo-Croatian birth, discovered a new theory of energy and gravity , called the Dynamic Theory of Gravity, which represented a unified field theory . Tesla's energy equation, \"C = E/R\", and Tesla's application to the Swiss Patent Office, for his flying saucer pa tent, was made while Albert Einstein was a second class patent clerk there. Einstein's work was an Illuminati conspiracy to obliterate Tesla's discoveries, so the Illuminati could control flying saucers and create our energy slavery. 20. The government's policy of looting and suppr essing ideas from independent scientists, inventors, and thinkers, on behalf of the Trilateral Commission, is related to this process, involving (1) stealing ideas from creative individuals; (2) destroying those individuals' credibilities, to conceal the sources and technology; (3) ruining the lives of those individuals (even murdering them if necessary), and denying compensation or credit; (4) exercising the option to suppress the ideas under \"national security' laws\", or giving the di scoveries to their corpor ate crook partners for exploitation; and (5) abusing and misusing the judicial system to carry out and enforce this illegitimate, criminal process. 21. I am either correct in what I say, or am en titled to a Nobel Prize for new discoveries in gravitational theory and nuclear physics. The former is most certainty true. Since Russia in fact acquired the services of the top Nazi flying saucer scientists, and the top rocket scientists, from the Peenemunde operation, in 1945, there is a strong pos sibility that the Russians were privy to these secrets.

Though incorrect, this argument is included and compared with the material in the Introduction (\"XI: Occult Ether Physics\"), and other ma terial, to give it as fair an argument as it deserves. Ether physics is \"it\", There is not 'anoth er system' which is powered by electrostatics, or Felix Schauberger's alleged boundary layer or other vague, undefined, \"new age Austrian\" method. Though other flying craft may be 'saucer-shaped', if they are not electrically powered, they are no more \"flying saucers\", than an oxcart shaped exactly like an automobile is a \"car\". The \"Adamski-type\" ships were complete fabrications , photographs of a chicken feeder. Adamski was on the CIA payroll, and his allegations were misinformation. In addition, there are many ways to create hoaxes. For example, it is easy to suspen d a model from a balloon, by means of a fine nylon fishing line, with camera out of focus, and produce a convincing photograph. Get real. Reality is unmistakable in certain cases. I knew from my observations in 1953, that a secret theory of gravity physics is involved in flying saucer technology. Today, over forty-five years later, the underlying cause of gravity is still (supposed to be ) a mystery. People continue in the Relativist Rut, blabbering on about Einstein, but Einstein never explained gravity. Truth, like creativity, requires courage. Scientific cowards continue to yield to the Trilateralist sham. Since around 1950, textbook writers have followed secret government orders, helping us 'forget' some (now) little-known facts once taught al ong with Newton's law of accel erating bodies. Fascist-state revisionists concealed the scientific truth about gr avity as a \"national security secret\". In 1942, the F.B.I, sequestered all known information relating to a scientific understanding of gravity, electrical control of gravity, or 'free energy', as it might pertain to flying saucer technology. Accordingly, the same CFR and Illuminati which controlled Wernher von Braun and the Nazis, in the 1936-38 Los Alamos \"p2\"project, controlled our F.B.I. as well. For this reason, I have renamed J. Edgar Hoover, \"J. Edgar Himmler, the American Fascist in a Red Dress\". To conceal \"flying saucer secrets\", they rewrote theoretical physics, obliterating the greatest moments in mankind's scientific history. Perhaps when our people are reduced to ignorant, scientifically-deprived yokels, we will have \"nat ional security\", and only the NSA., the CFR, the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderbergers and the Il luminati (all one and the same) will possess true scientific knowledge. What the Rosicrucians/Illuminati refer to as the \"wisdom of the ages\", is actually a collection of stolen and concealed scientific—-not \"mystical\"--secrets! Such knowledge is discovered by individual geni uses, deluded into thinking they are doing mankind a favor, but instead unwittingly doing research for the Trilate ral Commission/Illuminati rats, who will steal and hide such \"treasures of posterity\", and use them to enslave mankind After all, the rats said, since a 'healthy petrol eum industry' is essential to \"national defense\", protecting Big Oil at the expense of scientific, economic, and social freedom and progress, is in the \"national security interest\". Since society is \"not ready for the flying saucer\" - they decided without our consent—such secrecy was \"sound public policy\"; after all, how could Gulf Oil continue to produce and sell gasoline and diesel at a 'fair' profit, if one could fly a zillion miles on a gallon? With such inventions as the flying saucer at th e public's disposal, the economy would be wrecked, ALIENS52"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"they said (at least for the Trilateral Commission). Meanwhile, our government helped the fascists take firmer control of the system, in the interest of \"national security\". PHONY RESEARCH AND SCIENTIFIC ALZHEIMERS Numerous centers throughout the world conduct \"gravity research\", to 'prove' Newton's laws. The only parts of these old laws which have been brought into question, deal only with the first few inches of a falling body's acceleratioa The remainder of the tests are false, deceptive, and unscientific, intended to dispel widespread suspici on by lay people, to reassure the lazy scientists who accept them, and to heap ridicule upon doubters. Without accurate and honest tests, over at least 1,000' of vertical drop, the results are wort hless. Yet what independent scientists have the personal finances or resources to conduct these te sts accurately on their own? Most people accept the theories of the \"experts\", failing to realize they are government-paid, Trilateralists/Illuminati national security\" yeggs. \"Question everything\", the ancient Greeks wisely advised. I predict that proper tests will eventually disprove Newton's laws in a big way. Such tests would require a vertical, non-metallic, non-electrica lly-conductive tube, extending up at least 1,000' from the earth's surface, which could be evacuated . A weight carrying a precision movie camera with a digital clock read-out, would photograph calibrations on the sides of the tube, as it was dropped. Its rate of accelera tion would be accurately record ed. When the weight reached approximately 120 mp.h., no further acceleration should occur. At the accepted rate of acceleration (32'/sec./sec.), the 120 mp.h. velocity should be reached at approximately 696 feet. However, if I am correct, this could take eith er more or less distance/time, depending on the reaction. Nikola Tesla's Dynamic Theory of Gravity provided a scientific basis for explaining Newton's \"laws\" of gravity, which attempted to explain with some degree of mathematical certainty, the physical measurements, and offered no cause. Even this is questionable. The erroneous concept of \"anti-gravity\" cannot explain flying saucer propulsion. Insufficient to merely \"overcome\" gravity, or \"reverse\" it, propelling a ship with astounding results and directional controls is much more. The fictitious moon ship of H. G. Welles' Dr. Cavour-was rased on a \"blocking\" theory, in which 'doors' were painted with \"Cavourite\", which blocked gravity. This chapter includes my examination of an electrostatic theory of gravity, and attempts to explain flying saucer propulsion in the manner demonstrated by observed flying saucers. Hydrogen has the highest charge-to-mass ratio of any element. Accordingly, it is the lightest elcment, even though its nuclear proton and orb ital electron are identical to those of lead. The masses of the remaining elements are determin ed according to their re spective mass units and densities, and eharge-to-mass ratios, which are corre lative to their relative gravitational, electric, and electromagnetic interactions. I consider electrons as already having \"negative gravity\" (or \"anti-gravity\"), even though they have mass, because they will normally tend to gravitate upward from the earth, like a light gas, due to their high charge-to-mass ratio and low mass density. This is more consistent with ether theory than with Relativism. Cosmic radiation and lightning storms bring electrons down to the earth, which is generally an electro- positive mass, upon the surface of which a continuous negative charge is maintained by lightening, though the el ectrons tend to 'leak' and migrate back upward. Accordingly, the ionosphere is charged at least 176 million volts positive in respect to the earth, ALIENS53"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"creating a vertical electric field, which gradiates from sea level, around 150 volts per meter upward, from negative to positive. This electric field is reversed and multiplied around ten times under storm clouds, rendering the earth's surface relati vely positive under the storm clouds, since the higher negative charges of the clouds repe l the earth's negative 'like'-charges. This vertical electric field might be erroneously conceived as the origin of gravity, but there are many gravitational planets which have no ionosphere, while all atomic mass possesses electrostatic charges which are in motion with th e masses, representing currents (H. A. Rowland's experiment), a fact used by Tesla in support of his Dynamic Theory of Gravity. Gravity is apparently a secondary product resulting from an imbalance of other, primary forces. No separate basis has been found, though an electrostatic imbalance is evidenced in atomic matter. The Dutch physicist, Hendrik Antoon Lorentz (1833-1928), in measuring the relative magnitude of the single negative (\"moving\" or \"orbital\") electron charge, and the positive (\"stationary\" or \"nuclear\") proton charge in the hydrogen atom, actually claimed the two to be slightly unequal, with the proton possessing an ex cess positive charge, slightly greater than the allegedly 'equal and opposite' negative electron ch arge. This information has been conveniently disregarded, since, by implication, it contradicts the Relativist Theory, since unequal charges could disqualify the entire theory, and support Tesla's Dynamic Theory of Gravity. Lorentz further postulated that this excess positive charge is re sponsible for the weak force of gravity, and that, by increasing the negative (moving) charges, the grav ity of an atom's stationary nuclear positive mass would be entirely \"canceled\". Even so, how would this explain electropulsion? It wouldn't Lorentz calculated the electromagnetic forces en countered by a body, within an electric and magnetic field, according to the equations of Si r George Clerk Maxwell. This force, called a \"Lorentz Force\", is so much more powerful than the force of gravity, that it is difficult to conceive. Nontheless, it is only part of the picture, since it purported to represent only a comparison between static electrical and gravitational attractive for ces, rather than the net dynamic \"interaction\". After all, one has to bear in mind that, in addition to Werner Heisenberg's so-called \"Uncertainty Principle\", there is the problem of considering the fact that, in all attempts to measure anything on earth, all the measuring instruments, the observer, and all charges are in motion, at over 70,000 mph through space, which means that everything contains \"currents\". INERTIA AND ELECTROMAGNETISM Since, according to Lorentz's hypothesis, gravity is the result of an imbalance in electrostatic charge/content, this imbalance should also explain Newton's laws, except there was no provision for the dynamism of the universe in it. Since Nikola Tesla knew Lorentz, it is also possible they discussed these views. Tesla said that electrostatic force is the most important force for us to study. Although his gravity discoveries were comp lete over 100 years ago, the Illuminati stole ten away, and smugly keeps them from us today, wh ile hiding, or misrepresenting essential parts of gravity and ether theory and experimental results. Excess positive charges, or parts thereof in a body, induce negative electrostatic reactance when moving through space permeated by electric and magnetic fields. Since all mass is in motion, and all space is permeated by electric and magnetic fields, this inducement applies to all bodies and all space. The earth induces negative electrostatic reactan ce as it moves through space. Naturally, this inducement also applies to all bodies within the dynamic electric field of earth, in ALIENS54"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"which enormous, rapidly varying electrostatic for ces exist. This inducement continually changes the electromagnetic characteristics of the bodi es and the space, according to their relative movements, and redistributes the conglomeration of changes. Accordingly, with a redistribution (or \"displacement\") movement, away from or toward the equilibrium position, an equal and opposite force tending to counteract it, is produced in tie direction from which the negative electrostatic forces of the earth emanate, which is called \"gravi ty\". This is part of Tesla's Dynamic Theory of Gravity, which requires an understanding of the ether and its effects. Inertia is the resistance within a body to changes in its state of motion. Momentum is the same thing, since all mass is already in motion, but the cause of this resistance to change requires an ether theory which includes the tubes of fo rce. Inertia/Momentum is observed in the dynamic rotor of an electric generator, in which the moment um of the rotor is imparted, via electric current (tubes of force), to the rotor of an electric motor r un by that current. In other words, as the rotor is placed into motion, it absorbs electric tubes of force, which travel through the circuits to the motor, which absorbs and dissolves the tubes, imparting momentum to it. Although the laws of inertia are incorrectly said not to apply to the laws of electromagnetism, that is a lie. Where the electromagnetic interaction is 10 40 times stronger than the gravitational interaction, force gathered in a gravitational interaction—momentum—such as by hydraulically turned dynamos, may be converted into much stronger electropulsive force! (In this respect, I refer you to the Introduction; V: A Comparison of Gravitational and Electrical Force, as Applied to Flying Saucer Propulsion.) This little trick of nature yields so much free energy that the Illuminati have been masturbating over it for over half a century. It allows for much more powerful electromagnetic energy to be concentrated and stored in much weaker inertial form, until converted and magnified into relatively super-strong electropulsive form. If inertia is the result of a body's resistance to changes in the strong electromagnetic patterns (the pitch, frequency, and momentum of its ether micro-helices) existing as a result of its particular state of rest or motion, within a particular electrostatic ether environment, then the synthetic conditions of an electric generator's rotor field coils are only an unnaturally altered state of the conditions which were already there. I am reminded of the account as to how Tesla discovered the rotating electromagnetic field, in a flash of creativ e intuition, while on a walk with a friend named Tageti in Buda-Pest, over 100 years ago, and quoting a line from Goethe. Existing patterns of forces acting on a body become uniform whenever there is no change in its state of motion, and the body encounters no force. Only when the body accelerates, decelerates, or changes directions, or encounters certain external bodies or electric or magnetic forces, do the existing patterns of force resist the ch ange. This is consistent with the theory of the tubes of force. It is obvious that this phenomenon is electromagnetic. Albert Einstein's hypothesis that a mechanism having weights which oscillated over time, as a gravitational analogy to the oscillating electric and magnetic fields in induc tance, would generate \"gravity waves\", as the gravitational equivalence of dectromagnetic waves, was obviously wrong, else someone would have easily proved it Since that hy pothesis has never been a secret, it is additionally wrong. Just exactly how Einstein thought such 'waves' were supposed to be responsible for the alleged \"attractive force\", even if they could be generated that way, remains unclear. The reason we know that inertia/momentum is an electromagnetic phenomenon, is because it occurs only during the acceleration, deceleration, or directional changes which are essential to inductance principles, and because we can find no other reason. Since no inductance occurs unless ALIENS55"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"electric or magnetic fields change, or unless a body moving within than changes, causing inversely rising, collapsing, and reversing electromagnetic fields, there is no essential difference between electromagnetic and gravitational, inertial/momentum forces, which cannot be explained using electromagnetic theory, integrated with a valid and consistent theory of ether physics. The propulsive force also appears on the corr ect axis, as predicted by the Hall Effect. We know that magnetic lines of force exist, an d can chart them with paper and iron filings. These lines represent variations in magnetic flux densities, along and across flow lines. Whenever a conductor or body cuts through them, electric current results in the conductor or body. An electric current creates a magnetic field around its elf and the conductor or body through which it flows, at right angles to itself, according to th e \"right hand rule\". The variations between the magnetic field lines represent the necessary change s required to generate the current within the conductor cutting through them, and therefore even a \"D.C.\" generator creates its current by an \"alternating\" (high-frequen cy) inductance phenomenon. MOMENTUM AND INDUCTANCE Since a spinning object cuts through lines of a magnetic field which can permeate it, the earth thereby generates an electric current, which continues to build up at right angles to its magnetic field, until sufficient to cancel the magnetic field. This comports with the Hall Effect, If the current is drained off, the magnetic field is increased, and vice-versa. If a spinni ng object creates an oscillating current, it therefore constitutes an electromagnetic dipole, which multiplies the electromagnetic energy radiated at the forth power of its frequency . As Tesla said, every physical entity has a natural set of electromagnetic resonant frequency characteristics. It has been suggested that gyroscopes actually respond to electromagnetic transmitter/receiver effects, beyond our solar system. As the basis for the celestial guidance syst em invented and tested by Tesla in 1917, and developed further by the Germans during WW II, they were not used by us until twenty years later. The electric field of a spinning body, at a partic ular rpm, within earth's weak magnetic field, should generate increased negative charges sufficie nt to partially cancel its own gravity, by causing a partial reversal of the displacement of its charges, to lessen their down force, as the ether passes through. Since it rotates about its center, the greatest angular velocity is along its outer circumference. Once its surface charges begin to move, the magnetic field is progressively blocked, as in a Faraday cage. Because earth's magnetic fiel d is so weak, a spinning body will not develop enough upward electromagnetic thrust to become weightless, but delivers its entire gravity on its spinning point, even when turned completely sideways, as with a gyroscope, which behaves in \"semi-defiance\" to gravity. The stabilizing properties of a gyroscope, which behaves as if held by something in space, proves the existence of the ether and tubes of force. I observed that precession is common to falling objects, even though they are not spinning, which becomes especially pronounced after they have fallen for around 700 feet. This can beseen in movies of falling bombs. Though an object falling at 120 m,p.h. may be virtually weightless, it still has momentum/inertia, and the force delivered when it strikes the ground is electromagnetic momentum built up over time. A flying saucer's electromagnetic momentum is not bound by the law of acceleration of falling bod ies, determined by the time required for a falling object, accelerated by the force of gravity , to absorb a certain quantum of tubes of force, but may be greatly accelerated by the high voltage current, and multiplied. Falling objects are penetrated by ALIENS56"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"ether carriers, which bring along the micro-helical tubes of force, which during acceleration have progressively increasing pitch, before dissolving, transferring momentum to the mass. All bodies are both gravitationally and electromagnetically affected by the principles of inertia, momentum, polarity, and precession, as explored in the Introduction. Their movement, as flying machines, may be caused according to the Ha ll Effect the reactions of which are of such magnitude that they can only be surpassed by nuclear fission or fusion reactions. Nikola Tesla built his flying saucers around 1915, using his tuned, re sonant air-core coils. 62 years ago, there was a secret German flying saucer project at Los Alamos, using technology stolen from Tesla, called \"p2\", the existence of which has been carefully concealed. Baron Wernher von Braun was in charge of that project. He dated several women in the Santa Fe area, in 1936-38, and those women describe d him as a romantic and gregarious man. He moved rather freely from Germany, to here, then back to there, to run Germany's top secret \"rocket\" center at Peenemunde, then easily glided once again back to Ft. Bliss, Texas, in 1945, all with the facility of a gazelle leaping a small creek . Von Braun was not an inventor, but more of a \"pusher\" of projects...a \"politician with a rocket\". He has been depicted as a \"dreamer\", who only wanted to \"go to the moon\"...to travel \"...beyond the stars\". Now that we know of his control ova the \"p2\" project, on behalf of the Illuminati, a secret society to which the major political players—Hitler, Einstein, Von Bra un, Himmler, Lenin, Trotsky, Davi d Rockefeller, to name only a very few—all belonged, the almost incredible phenomenon of von Braun's international cha-cha is more fully understood. And what of the false story that there was \"...nothing at Los Alamos but a boy's camp\" before the war? It is simply not possible that those responsible for that story could be so ignorant, and the \"Los Alamos Story\" is just one more chapter in the Book of the Big Lie, intended to magnify the importance of the huge government expenditures there, by laying claim to many things which were developed first elsewher e, by other people. Even the \"p2\" project was second-hand, having been stolen from Tesla. WEIGHTLESSNESS, \"p2\", AND THE TUBES OF FORCE It is my belief that an important fact has been ostensibly omitted from what is taught today...that a falling body will cease to accelerate when it reaches a velocity of about 120 m.p.h....at which it naturally maintains or tends to maintain a constant velocity. Has this been secreted away by the Illuminati, because it presupposes other important facts, which naturally occur once the first fact is known? If so, it represents additional proof of the existence of an interceding 'substance'—the ether—and suggests the accumula tion of something at a predetermined rate which has reached its maximum under the natural forces present. If the reaction due to the gravitational constant G ceases to accelerate a body at the 120 mph velocity, it could be because of a time-related \"equal and opposite reaction\" to the force with which it is actuated to move downward, evidenced by the counter-buildup of momentum, sufficient to cancel the acceleration due to the gravitational force G. Does this buildup cancel the G-force, proportionately with time, as the body finally becomes weightless , with its entire gravity cancelled? Could it be for this reason that one physically, momentarily, senses complete weightlessness, when riding in an airplane which is taking off, at the instant that it passes through the 120 mph velocity? Most people probably th ink the sensation is when the plane leaves the ground, because so many planes leave the ground at about the same time, but the sensation of physical ALIENS57"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"weightlessness is quite different than just becoming airborne, and can be felt in the inner ear, causing a special sensation in the stomach. It is al so possible that the principle of aerodynamic lift is supplemented by the tubes of force as stated in the Introduction. As atmospheric air resistance slows down a falling body, the gravitational constant again comes into play, so as to acceler ate it once again to the constant velocity, and so forth, thus maintaining the constant velocity, at which the equal and opposite positive-mass G-force, and the anti-gravity, electropulsive neutralizing force, are in equilibrium, with the precession angle at its maximum, and precession frequency at its minimum. Michael Faraday's experiments showed that an excess negative charge will always appear on the surface of an enclosed, hollow vessel. You place a charge inside, and it will always appear on the outside. This mystery is a convenient tool for flying saucer technology, because we don't want those charges jumping around inside our cockpit, all over us, but want them outside, where they can do their work. All bodies are essentially compos ed of entities which represent \"electrical content\" (protons, electrons, neutrons). The presence of these charge s in a dynamic mass, allows it to generate or attract its own electrons, to create them from Omni Matter, or to emit them, and to encounter its own gravitational reactions, according to its relati ve movement, within the magnetic and electric fields of its environment. This is probably what Nikola Tesla had in mind in his Dynamic Theory of Gravity, The fact that the government has it, and no copies of it are available to the public, should indicate the importance of this over 100-year-old theory, except most scientists have never even heard of the theory. We already know that the same Trilateral/Illuminati symbol was used in the original Nazi-run \"p2\" Los Alamos project, and in Chapter II, I relate how it appeared on the 1950's I.G.S. resonator implantations. It has been reported in several forms on UFOs. According to what we know about the difference between the gravitational, electrical, and electromagnetic interactions, if there is a tiny excess positive charge on the proton--so small that its detection has been concealed from ordinary gu llible 'physicists'—s uch a charge could hypothetically be the origin of the weak \"gravitational interaction\". Suppose the gravitational force is equal to the electrical for ce created by the hypothetical exce ss positive charge of the hydrogen proton, in terms of accounting for its \"gravity\", which is the least for all known elements. For the same reasons, all the elements would be very close to being weightless, An atom of even one of the heavier elements, lead, may require the add ition of less than a single election, to gravitationally/electrically cancel all of its mass unit s, and to give it the same charge-to-mass ratio as hydrogen. In order for us to appreciate the power electrons exert over protons and neutrons, it should be emphasized mat the mass of a proton is around 1,837 times that of an electron, (the neutron having a slightly higher ratio). While it is said that the neutron is electrically neutral, because it is composed of a proton and a 'tigh tly bound electron', this ne utrality only applies to electrical conductivity, and has not been shown to relate to electro-gravitation. The neutron's tightly bound electron already cancels most of its positive charge, but the cumulative total of all the tiny excess positive charges—if the Lorentz hypothesis is correct—of the 82 protons and 125 other neutrons of the lead atom, are still unaccounted for. Under these circumstanoes, the vast differences between electromagnetic and gravitational interactions favors \"gravity\". Since it would only be necessary to add whatever negative charge required to equal the totality of all those tiny excessive positive charges, in order to completely cancel the gravity of the lead atom, it would be necessary ALIENS58"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"to add less than a single complete electron! Ot herwise, the lead atom would already possess another electron. The first thing that an atom \"does\" when its nuclear mass develops an (electrical) \"need\" for another electron, is to acquire a new one in its outer orbit. All atoms, molecules, or compounds, composing the matter on or around our earth, are predominantly electro-positive (although some of them are considered electro-negative in relation to hydrogen, sometimes by as much as perhaps six volts, but this is only in terms of \"free electrons\", in non-ionized states). The charge-to-mass ratios of all elements are positive in nature, because in all cases, even hydrogen, there is excess positive mass in their nuclei. The high voltage charges on a saucer's front or top, easily \"penetrate\" electron cloud barriers, and should exhibit an electrical attractive force to ward external positive matter, which according to Lorentz, is 2.2 x 10 39 times stronger than the gravitational attr active force, but this is not true, and does not work \"at a distance\". This huge force, which according to the Ne wtonians, acts over a greater distance, conflicts with the Relativists, wh o don't believe there is a force at a distance, which is something I agree with, for different reasons. The \"electromagnetic interaction\", for reasons unexplained, is less than this, or 10 40 times the gravitational \"interactive\" force G. If the Relativists don't believe in force at a distance, why do they keep referring to the \"attractive\" force? AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION It has been incorrectly assumed that the Michelson-Morley Experiments disproved the existence of an ether, based on a failure to observe a \"shift\" (the \"red-shift\") on the fringes of two light beams placed at 90 degrees, perpendicular to the earth, at equidistant positions from their point of intersectioa Since ether theory asserted the ether as the medium which conducts light through space, and si nce no shift was observed, these results were misint erpreted to mean that there is no ether. This experiment was based on Lorentz' erroneous concept of a \"quiescent, stationery ether\", which held that there is an ether 'wind' which is everywhere the same, and that Maxwell's deficient calculation of C was a constant, but which in fact failed to provide two required constants of integration for time (one for each of its two differential equations), which included no definition of Maxwell's coordinate system's position and velocity (as a vector sum). The false assumptions which arose from this failure by Maxwell resulted in the Lorentz' equation, called the Lorentz Transformation, which had built into it, the elastic space/time frame which attempted to supply Maxwell's lack of defin ition, and to explain the red shift observed near planets in space. It was this el astic space-time frame in the Lorentz Transformation which was adopted by Einstein in his Relativity theory, in itiated to conceal and suppress ether physics. Since ether theory had already assumed that gravity is a function of the ether, Einstein was incorrect to treat photons the same way as material bodies, to explain the red-shift, with the theory that the photons passing near a planet were \"c urved by the space-time continuum\", producing the spectral shift. According to the Relativists, it wa s supposedly proved, on May 29,1919, \"...that we live in a curved, four-dimensional space-time'\". Al bert Einstein said a massive body spinning in space \"...would drag space and time around with it ...\", the origin of so-called \"frame-dragging\" 1 Gary Taubes, Relativists in Orbit, Discover (Mar., 1997). ALIENS59"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"and \"space curvature\" which Tesla was so opposed to, along with Einstein's statement, \"Gravity is no longer a mysterious force acting at a distance but the result of an object trying to travel in a straight line through space curved by the presence of material bodies\". In researching for more possible explanations for this apparent tragi-comedy of mistakes, I found an article by Swedish physicist, John-Erik Persson 1 , who seemed to agree with me. Persson said the Michelson-Morley experiment showed that the ether is space-dependent, not non-existent. Since the observations were made by stationary equipment in relation to earth (moving at over 70,000 mph through space), it was not a valid ground for postulating Relativi ty. If the ether has a constant velocity V in relation to the observer, the observed velocity of light becomes a vector sum C + V, according to ether theory. If the observer is moving at the same velocity and in the same direction as the ether, no red-shift should be observed. Michelson's empirical results showed that V, near the earth, is equal to the velocity of the nearest part of the earth (in the horizontal plane), in agreement with an ether which was stationary near the earth. This gave rise to Relativity, which made the false assumption that an observer will always find V to be zero, independent of his own velocity, giving rise to elastic space-time concepts, which are against intuition. What I always point out as Einstein's preocc upation with his \"apparent effects\", resulting from an observer's failure to take into consideration his own motion, as well as the possibility that the ether has zero velocity only near the earth's su rface. This zero velocity was due to what Tesla said was the \"rigidification\" of the ether caused by the emanation of earth's rapidly varying electrostatic forces, which would decrease in intensity at the square of the distance from earth, as the ether would have a commensurately increased relative motion. This same rigidification of the ether was consistent with Tesla's (Faraday's, Wm . Thomson's) statement that the ether behaved as a \"fluid to material bodies, and a solid to heat and light\", as still another explanation for the red- shift. That would allow the ether near plan ets to refract the light passing near it. Persson said that the theory of the ether interprets Maxwell's results as The velocity of Light = C + V. With the missing space dependent V(R) (velocity V and position vector R) supplied, the Lorentz Transformation is unnecessary, (and rationality and truth are restor ed to physics!). V(R) must represent a description of reality, and the reality of material particles is defined everywhere by acceleration A(R), concerning the distribution of matter in a vicinity. We have reason to suspect a relationship between V(R) (the translational field) and A(R), (the gravitational field), showing their common origin (the ether), shown by a photon (a fa st wave field) added to gravity (the ether, a slow reference field). Since V(R) (the fast wave field) is the distribution of matter in the vicinity, it has the same value as the nearest part of a big ma terial body it may be near, as a more reasonable interpretation which agrees with the Michelson-Morley experiment, showing that the photon adapts its velocity to local conditions. This means that the space-depende ncy of the translational field, V(R), allows the theories of Newton and Maxwell to be united without any non-linear Lorentz Transformations, and that, by 1 John-Erik Persson, About an Alte rnative to the Lorentz-Transformation (Hagersten, Sweden, 1997). ALIENS60"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"the rule of Ockham's Razor, the Translational Field is a more plausible explanation than the Theory of Relativity. I had always assumed that, since calculations of C made in conductors and fiber optics, require the \"velocity factor\" (.97 x C in free space), that such an adaptation of C to the local conditions of the conductors, disproves the Lorentz Transformation and the Theory of Relativity. NIKOLA TESLA'S DYNAMIC THEORY OF GRAVITY Tesla's Dynamic Theory of Gravity (c. 1893-94) was based on the idea that all bodies emit microwaves (rapidly varying electrostatic forces) of particular voltage and frequency, as determined by their \"electrical content\" (mass, composed of protons, electrons, and neutrons), and relative motion. Tesla measured the microwaves of the earth with a special tube he invented (you could see the peaks and nodes of the microwaves cr eated in the gas in the tube), as being only a few centimeters in wavelength. He said the frequency and voltage were related to the velocity and mass (electrical content) of the earth, and that gravitational interaction between bodies, was determined by the vector product of the mutual in teraction of their microwaves with the ether, and to electric currents and tubes of force, pass ing through space and between and within bodies. Tesla confirmed this, placing two metal plates a certain distance apart, and electrifying them with high voltage, high frequency currents (\"Tesla currents\", or \"microwaves\"). At sufficiently high voltage and frequency, the space between them became \"solid state\". It also worked with one plate only, suspending the zinc plate (1/8\" thick x 12\" square, weighing about two pounds) in mid-air. This is further documented in 1943 FBI documents released under the F.O.I.A., as being witnessed by Marguerite Merrington, in an 1894 demonstration by Tesla in his Houston Street laboratory. 1 \"p2\" The flying saucer uses \"p2\", which refers to tw o potentials, primaries or kinds of currents. The forward end of a saueer--\"pl\"—uses Tesla's tuned \"Single Terminal Coil\" (see page 300 for set of plans), tuned to either 1/4 wavelength, or 3/8th wavelength. It is an air-core, step-up transformer, which converts normal A.C. current to high voltage, high frequency current, which has charge-increasing effects similar to an elect rostatic generator, but with a much greater reactance, due to its high frequency and tuning, whic h allows it to shoot out bursts of current of one sign (positive or negative) from one end, whil e remaining neutral or peak reverse voltage on the other end. Tesla created this coil specifically for the purpose of powering his flying saucer, even before the century began. Tesla noted and was gr eatly pleased by the \"pseudo-electrostatic\" effects of his coils. In writing a critique of the enormous Van de Graaff generator built by M.I.T. and tested in 1938, Tesla pointed out the fact mat only a tiny version of one of his coils, dating from the 1890s, would outperform the giant Van de Graaff. This is because a Tesla coil uses alternating, high frequency, high voltage inductance, to throw out electrostatic, D.C. pulses. A much smaller unit will produce the necessary high voltages, th rough inductance, and a much smaller conductor 1 FBI Documents Regarding Nikola Tesla (252 pages), Part 1, page 49, LIST OF PERSONS ASSOCIATED WITH NIKOLA TESLA. ALIENS61"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"will carry the high frequency current, while D.C. systems require much larger conductors for the same total wattage. In MHD pumping, it has been proven that a pulsing DC, current is better than a steady D.C. current, so the Tesla coil is ideal for the flying saucer application, producing the traditional purplish brush, a facsimile to the earth's aurora borealis. Using \"p2\", the vastly greater strength of the electromagnetic interaction is applied to control the very weak, gravitational interaction, to pump the ether and tubes of force into the ship and dissolve them, to impart momentum to the conductors attached to the ship, at right angles to the electric and magnetic fields, as explained in the Introduction. A relatively small amount of electromagnetic force, created by an alternator tu rned by a Tesla turbine, can easily dominate the gravity of a large ship, create electromagne tic momentum, and propel it at great speed. In theory, an oscillating electric dipole consis ts of two equal and opposite charges of dipole moment p, where p oscillates sinusoidally with time. A dipole which is tuned to 3/8th or 1/4 wavelength, will c ontinue to throw out energy even when the conditions are reversed, because there is a time-lag between changes in charge a nd current distributioa The power radiated varies as the fourth power of the frequency, so the higher the frequency, the higher the reactance. The use of the 3/8th tuning, causes the positive and negative potentials to cross and neutralize one another on the neutral end, while emitting the desired peak negative pulses at the other. The 3/8th tuning is convenient where it is desireable to have a neutra l connection for the lower end of the coil. Since all gravitational atomic mass has a net positive charge, the negative charges are needed to manipulate gravity. The positive mass possessed by the ether carriers, reacts with the negative pulses, to attract them into the conductor, aeating and bringing along the tubes of force, which are dissolved in the conductor, to impart momentum to the conductor, with a force which is 10 40 times stronger than the gravitational force: Fe/Fg = 10 40 x Fg The primary L-C circuit is composed of a primary coil (of few turns, using a large conductor), choke coil, spark gap, tuning coil, and capacitors. This combination produces the primary frequency for inductance of the secondary coil, of many turps, using a small conductor. The inverse ratio in number of turns and conducto r size converts the electricity from low to high pressure. Tesla found that a primary coil consisting of a wide, thin, strip of metal, laid down flat between layers of insulation, was best, because it had less (undesirable) \"self-inductance\". This is even better with the bi-filar coil, which eliminates self-inductance altogether. (NOTE: The following illustration was an unlabeled drawing from a patent application which Tesla withdrew, to prevent J.P. Morgan from acquiring the invention, since Morgan tricked Tesla into giving him a 51% controlling interest in \"all his patents\", when he funded his Wardenclyffe world energy system project When Tesla was driven into bankruptcy, the patent didn't issue and Morgan didn't own it. Tesla made this discovery at about the time his Colorado Springs experiments ended, as a new way to produce electricity from air, shown as follows: ALIENS62"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" The consideration of gravity as a separate for ce may be superfluous, since it appears to be a naturally occurring weak electromagnetic interaction in the first place, caused by displacement of the nuclei of atomic mass downward by the upwar d passage of ether carriers and dissolving tubes of force, induced by the currents created by the movement of mass through space. As previously stated, gravitational mass is almost electrically balanced and neutral. If a flying saucer has an artificially created, strong, relatively negative charge, it will strongly attract relatively positive ether carriers. Of c ourse, where this attraction is equal in every direction, the saucer will go nowhere.

THE LORENTZ FORCE If both an electric field and a magnetic field are present in a region of space, the resulting force on a moving charge is the vector sum of the electrical and magnetic force, and is known as a Lorentz Force, as shown by: F = qE + qVxB For this reason, Lorentz said the electric attractive force is 2.2 x 10 39 times stronger than the gravitational attractive force. The magnitude of charge on the electron (supposedly matched by the charge on the proton) is e =1.6 x 10 -19 C. The gravitational force is also allegedly a constant: (NOTE: Lorentz alleged that e+ is slightly less than the (positive) reciprocal to 1.6xl0 -19 C, which suggested that Fg is really the electrical product of that difference. I found this information only by incidentally referenced (\"glossed\", handwritten not ations on the sides of the pages) in material available at the National Security and Resources Study Center at Ins Alamos (now called The J. Robert Oppenheimer Study Center), in 1979. The reference was possibly an inadvertent \"lapse in security\", since it isn't mentioned widely, but it may have been conveniently ignored because it conflicts with the current Relativis t theory, and may show that Lorentz made several serious errors. THE ATMOSPHERE AS A CLOUD CHAMBER EXPERIMENT Lorentz' hypothesis implied that, in the natural electric and magnetic fields of the earth, a saucer need only be given a net negative charge in order to be accelerated toward the ionosphere with a Lorentz Force which is many times the for ce of the gravity normally pulling it downward. According to Lorentz's naive hypothesis, by merely adding an excess negative charge to a ship, the force of gravity would be neutralized, just that easy! Would this not only free the craft from inertial as well as gravitational force, while also repelling it upward with the like' negative charges on the earth? I once thought that , once conditions necessary for electromagnetic repulsion have come into play, there would be no gravity. Would that it were so easy! Lorentz' silly theory was wrong! We all make mistakes. Besides, during thunderstorms, the electric field is reversed, due to the high negative charges on the bottoms of thunderclouds, which multiply the potentials around ten times. Had Lorentz' hypothesis been true, a saucer would be slammed to the ground with astounding force, though I have often observed that saucers do experience a pparent malfunctions in lightning storms, but not ALIENS64"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"enough to drive them down. There must be some provision for quickly adjusting the potentials and amperage to maintain somewhat stable flight beneath a thunder cloud, as the ships sometimes jump wildly around. A smart pilot would stay above the clouds when possible. The ionosphere, 620 miles above the earth, is at least 176 million volts positive in respect to the earth's surface at sea level. The earth's su rface generally possesses a high negative charge, maintained by thousands of lightening bolts per s econd, all over the earth's surface. This creates a vertical electric field, the potential of which incr eases from negative to positive, about 50 volts per foot (as observed by Tesla), or around 150 volts per meter, on a clear day. Since an electric field is always accompanied by a ma gnetic field at right angles to it, this also implies that earth's magnetic field might be a product of this earth-ionospheric electric field, but the magnetic field is more likely due to the huge current from the sun through the earth, as noted by Kristian Birkeland and Hannes Alfen. HORIZONTAL FLIGHT It should be noted that the mechanism for neutralization of the so-called gravitational force—which should be by the blockage of the upward-moving tubes of force which dissolve to accelerate the body downward—as a reversal of the mechanism of downward acceleration. This means that a saucer in horizontal flight might use negative D.C. pulses in its brush discharge on its top, for 'bouyancy', together with the high freqency A.C. on its bottom, to block the upward movement of tubes of force, while a stronger nega tive brush on (its forward, attracts the tubes of force in the direction of travel (with increased high frequency A.C. to its rear to block the tubes of force in that direction).The blockage of the upward-moving tubes of force alone, should block the force of 'gravity' and give the saucer bouyancy, though buoyancy may require the brush on top to bring in tubes of force. The direction and velocity of the movement of the saucer is the vector product of the electric and magnetic fields of the two bi-polar pairs, according to J.J Thomson. So what we have here is a sort of modula ted electronic surface on our saucer; a negative \"pseudo-electrostatic\" brush discha rge on top and in front, and a high frequency blocking current on bottom and to the rear. The vertical dipole cr eates 'buoyancy'—the vert ical position above the earth—and the horizontal dipole creates velocity. This would be similar to the Milliken \"cloud chamber experiments\", in which oil drops were su spended in the cloud chamber by adjustment of external electric and magnetic fields cris-crossin g the chamber, in respect to the charges possessed by oil drops, except with our saucer, moving charges are generated by motive power within it, to affect the ether external to it, to draw in and dissolve the tubes of force to accelerate it in any direction, in defiance to the magnetic and electric fields of the \"chamber\" (earth's atmosphere). Superimposed over this \"oil drop\" environment, is a double \"p2\"—one to position the saucer vertically, and the other to move it sideways—by emitting negative charges on one end to neutralize the gravitational and inertial effects on the other, thus actuating the ether and creating a powerful force to effortlessly pr opel the saucer forward instantane ously, while the internal effects of inertia, momentum and polarity are instantane ously switched and controlled, and the mass of the saucer is liberated from the ordinary rules of gr avity, inertia, momentum and polarity, with the saucer's internal (human and mechanical) contents protected from these forces.

The coil manipulates, recreates and magnifies the forces which normally exist, between atoms, and between e+ and e-, to control Fg, and to accelerate a body at astounding speeds. It is important to understand the effect of the shape of the outer hull on the distribution of the action of the force. Were the hull shaped concav e, rather than convex, the force field might become focused on a point some distance from the sa ucer, and react so as to merely draw whatever ether carriers and tubes of force might be at that focal point, toward the saucer with astounding force. It is for this reason that the outer hull is curved above, so as to \"spread\" the area over which the force acts to a very large area, drawing the tubes of force in. As pulses of high voltage, high frequency ne gative charges move outward to distribute themselves over the saucer surface, some combin e with atmospheric gasse s and \"slough off\" as ions, creating a \"protective envelope\" which shields the saucer from friction and heat, dampens the sonic boom, and creates the \"beautiful corona\" I observed in 1953...the \"lights\" often seen.

ALIENS66"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"CHAPTER II: PIECES OF THE PUZZLE COME TOGETHER Now that I have introduced you to the theory and possibilities, I will now get down to the nitty gritties of flying saucer nuts and bolts, and tell you how I discovered them, step by step, in an Odyssey which lasts even unto the present, as I fill in more and more of the details. My \"odyssey\" has involved some remarkable experiences and dangers which, in a way, remind me of a movie I saw a few years ago called Zardoz, starring Sean Connery. The title was derived from parts of the title words spelling \"Wizard of Oz\", on the cover of the book by L. Frank Baum. The story in Zardoz entailed the education of Connery by a secret elite. Connery played a murderous barbarian, through whom the elite, who had the secret of immortality, wanted to finally destroy themselves, because they had become tired of living. They arranged for tidbits of information to be made available to the barbarian, until he figured out that they were deceiving the violent society in which he lived, through a religious hoax, preaching constant destruction and war, and spewing out weapons from a giant head, for the barbarian worshippers to use against each other, while the elite lived in complete safety, wi th the secret of immortality as well. As you may see, there are certain parallels between my story and Zardoz, although I am not admitting that the society into which I was born tried to completely raise me as a barbarian, or that the elite which dominates us has any intent of bringing their power to an end The many \"revelations\" I have experienced, have appeared before me as if intentionally placed there by some clandestine elite. That did not happen to my knowledge, but it is creative and fun to imagine that it did. Some have suggested that the fact that so ma ny startling 'revelations' have seemed to have 'appeared' to me \"alone\", is \"statistically cha llenging\". The fact is, they appeared to me only because I was aware of them and not asleep. Ha d I not been aware of them, I would not have known about them I believe that there are astounding events occurring around many people, who, if they were aware of them, and mentioned them to others, as I have done, would also be accused of telling \"statistically challenging\" stories. I make no claim to having any \"mystical powers\" which would allow me to experience things others do not. What I do make claim to is the development of my natural skills to notice such things, so that if they occur, I will recognize them. It is too bad that the analogy of Zardoz does not fully apply to the Trilateral Commission, since they deserve to be destroyed, as punishment for the many wars they fomented, and are still fomenting, to needlessly sacrifice so many lives for an illicit profit, and to reduce the population according to parameters which only they know about, but which we can surmise. As you will see in this book, this analogy as applied to our society and its Secret Government is more appropriate than the typical Corporate Serf will allow himself to believe. He gets up each morning in the \"burbs, and drives to his job at the Feudal Corporation. He takes his Stepford Wife and love-starved children to the Church of the Brain-Dead War Robots on Sunday, and prays to the Lord of Collective Guilt for forgiveness, for the sin of having daydreamed about living a real life. He indiscriminately accepts the premises that he is \"his br other's keeper\", that the Marxist graduated federal income tax and the welfare syst em are the best way to enforce his religion on others through the state, as part of 'God's plan under our constitution', and that the Founding Fathers fully intended for our armed forces to police the whole goddamned world no matter what the cost in taxes and loss of American lives.

He doesn't believe in flying saucers at all, but if he did, he would think they were \"signs in the sky\" which the Old Testament said would be seen in the \"last days', or the \"wheel in the sky\" seen by the prophet Ezekiel. The CIA has used all these suggestions. The flying saucer I saw in 1953 was no prophetic \"sign in the sky\", but presented a genuine scientific mystery. I saw no sense in attempting to address every theory of gravity propounded by others, since they were obviously wrong. I didn't waste time with UFO reports or \"updates\" of every type either. Government organizations like Project Blue Book were just set up to plug leaks anyway. You are already familiar with what others have said, and are obviously unsatisfied, because you are now reading my book. So I will at least try to tell you how flying saucers work, and what my theory of gravity is, while others pretend that flying saucers are non-existent or \"extraterrestrial\" and that gravity is still a \"m ystery\". They look in vain for \"waves\" and \"particles\" (such as the \"graviton\"), and have really found nothing. Their experiments are only part of the Trilateralist science sham, and since th ey are still looking, they must not know, right? So I will stick my neck out, and give you my best shot. If what they say is really the extent of their knowledge, then the flying saucer would be one of those inventions which worked, but nobody who used it knew why, so if they really don't know, then I should be entitled to the Nobel Prize in physics (which is out of the question), or the Pulitz er Prize for Journalism (which I should get!). THE ODYSSEY BEGINS My \"flying saucer odyssey\" began with an in fantile boy's experiences with airplanes. My uncle, Roger Benton, had a Stearman biplane in the late '30s and early '40s, which he used for crop-dusting and any other hell or hair-raising, dangerous, daredevil-type fun activity. When I was around three, Roger flew into my grandfather's (\"Pa pa Benton's\") field one day. Like a kid, Papa wanted a ride. Roger was a \"chip off the old block\" , and inherited his love of excitement from his father. So, instead of a bronco, Papa wanted a ride in the plane. Roger took Papa up and gave him quite a thrill, especially when he looped the plane, and Papa had forgotten to fasten his safety belt. He saved himself only by locking his knees under the instrument panel, and hanging onto the joy stick. When Roger landed, Papa was still grinning, with a pale fringe about his lips and eyes revealing his narrow scrape with disaster. But that was part of the usual for those two. I fell in love with planes that day, as I wave d to Roger, and he disappeared into the clouds. My second 'big' plane impression was when I was around four, in 1942. Our neighbor had gone into flight training, and was stationed at a base which was near enough for him to buzz the neighborhood while on training flights. One morning, after a storm had flash-flooded the street in front of our little stucco house, with around a foot of standing water, I was wading in the street and gathering frogs which seemed to come from nowhere, since we lived on a desert. As I stood in the water-filled street, the flying nei ghbor came over, diving toward me while rocking his wings. His pull-out was almost too late, as I stood with my hands upraised, touching one of the wheels with my fingertips as the plane passed over me, narrowly missing me with its prop as my mother stood horrified in the front yard. Quite unaware of the danger I had experienced, this to me had a very ALIENS68"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"personal meaning, rather like the two reaching ha nds in the Sistine Chapel mural by Michelangelo. My fingers reached up as the 'wheel from the sky' reached down, and 'contact' was made. In 1942, my father joined the Sea Bees. After boot camp at Camp LeJeune, the Navy convinced him to transfer to th e regular Navy, because of his wi fe and three children, since the mortality rate for the See Bees at that time was 97%. He was sent to San Francisco, to set up and run the west coast Navy printing operation at San Francisco Naval Depot. Our whole family soon moved to Oakland, in 1943. For those two years in California, my life was immersed with being a \"Navy brat\", with weekends in San Francisco, and my frequent walks to the Museum of Oceanic Art, in Oakland. At six (1944), I found a German spy's short-wave radio, set up in the back of a trash bin behind a grocery store near our apartment building. Navy intelligence allowed me to keep it, along with another my father had found in 1942, under a bed in a hotel room during his first trip to San Francisco. A neighbor and I connected the marvelous radios to his father's antenna, and we \"listened to WW II\". The German shortwaves were fantastic, and I have ne ver seen another like them My mother threw them away one day because I forgot to remove them from the living room floor after repeated warnings. My mother and three kids returned to Texas for the last year of the war, staying at my grandparents' place in Dayton, Texas, around forty miles east of Houst on. (I later realized that this had been because of the Navy's test of the firs t American nuclear explosion at Port Chicago, California, on the Sacramento River, prior to the nu clear detonation at Trinity Site on White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.) After the war, our family returned to West Texas, where I resumed my interest in experimental aircraft, building many flying models. I took a strong interest in aerodynamics, and made hundreds of well-executed designs, plotted aer odynamic flow patterns, and even did some improvised wind tunnel tests. I belonged to the We st Texas Model Airplane Club, organized by three or four WW II aces, including Bill Decker , Don Wooten, and a man named McKinzie (who purportedly was highly decorated), and others. Around 1952, at fourteen, I delivered a paper to the group and its affiliate in Odessa, Texas, on the feasibility of a glider and soaring competition, suggesting Marfa, Texas, as an ideal site. This meeting was attended by several men and boys from Odessa, such as Wally Scott and Mr. Schleymeyer, who later became international competitors, and there is now an annual international glider and soaring competitition meet at Marfa. I wasn't able to be the first to start it, because my father had caught me building a full-sized glider, using our living room floor as a lofting surface, and scrapped my plans right away, because he feared I might break my neck. But that lecture, in my fourteenth year, was the beginning of the international glider competition at Marfa, started by men who had heard my lecture. Our town, Kermit, was around 325 miles E-S-E of White Sands Proving Grounds and Alamogordo, New Mexico. My first memories of \"flying discs\" (the first designation) and \"flying saucers\" (the second designation) which were sight ed in the area, was in 1946, even before the 1947 \"Mount Shasta\" siting. Before I had seen a saucer in daylight, I had heard reports of them from oilfield pumpers who worked the area north ward, near Jal, Carlsbad and Roswell, New Mexico, and had gotten other first-hand reports from several people who had seen them. From those reports, I knew that saucers were real, because that was before reports of them had appeared in newspapers, and the people sighting them really had no motive to say they had seen them unless it was true, since there was no sensationalism asso ciated with the phenomenon. Some of these ALIENS69"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"people had served in the Army Air Corps during the war, fighting in the skies of Germans', either as pilots, navigators, flight engineers, crew, gunners, or bombardiers, and often compared them to the \"foo-fighters\". I had watched the ships maneuve ring at night, but had never seen one in broad daylight, at close range, until 1953, although I had seen several discs high in the sky, at great distances, which looked like new dimes glinting in the sun, in the Roswell vicinity. By 1950, 1 had talked to many people who had seen saucers over the area, and was getting impatient. I slept in our back yard for nine months each year (the warmer months usually), and had observed whole squadrons of them in the night sky. I noticed that they had a peculiar habit of turning in increments of thirty degrees, or multip les thereof. This divided the compass into twelve coordinate directions, and indicated somethi ng about their navigational and flight system. Between 1950 and 1953, 1 hoped for a sighting, and never assumed that they were anything other than secret government aircraft from New Mexico. My mother had heard the rumor that they were connected to the A.E.C. and radiation, and th at they were nuclear-powered, using helium fuel. We had many friends all over New Mexico, particularly the Roswell area, Alamogordo, and Deming, because our family business was the only state-of-the-art decorating source in the area between Ft. Worth, El Paso, and Albuquerque, for several years, until 1954 or so. By 1952, 1 had developed a proficiency at aerodynamics, had designed and tested many experimental model aircraft, and had designed, built and tested my \"ground-effects\" system for autos, using a model with two engines, one to drive the wheels and the other to drive a prop on the back, which sucked air from under the belly pan. I planned on a career as an aerodynamicist and aeronautical design engineer, along with a career in art. I had, in effect, prepared my mind and senses to make rather specific observations , whenever the time came for me to have the opportunity to see a saucer up close, which I was convinced was in the near future. I had already been carefully building and testing flying model airplanes of every conceivable design, for seven years, since 1946 (when I was eight), and considered aeronautical design, aerodynamics, maneuverability, and performance characteristics as serious matters. I had also flown so many conventional and experimental designs that I could usually analyze a particular configuration and predict its aerodynamic behavior. I knew from my two 1952 propeller-driven flying saucers (powered by an \"Allard 19\" engine), that ve rtical stabilizers were essential on \"flying pancake\"-type designs. No fins had been seen by any of my witnesses on the saucers they had observed. This was already two years after the saucers had been sighted near our house, during which time I had hoped for a sighting. Yet, with all my intense interest in aircraft, I would not ride in a real airplane until I caught a hop' from Keesle r, A.F.B., Mississippi to Texas, in a general's C-47, when I was an 18-year-old Air Force trainee. In the summer of 1950, during the time of the sightings, I had gone to the Buffalo Trail Scout Ranch in the Davis Mountains, for a two-week bivouac with my troop. During my stay in the mountains, cut off from the outside world, after returning from a trek lasting several days, we discovered that Manchurian tanks ha d rolled across the 38th Parallel in Korea. On return home, I had learned that, on the first day of the Korean War, a flying saucer had appeared in broad daylight, above the city hall across the street from our house, and had maneuvered for fifteen minutes, and that, on the following day, two saucers had appeared, and maneuvered for thirty minutes. In each case, my mo ther was the first one to spot them She taught China painting classes as part of our family business. On each of the two days, she went outside to fill her bowl with water and rinse out slip, with water from a faucet on our front porch. Being a ALIENS70"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"farmer's daughter, she had a habit of surveying the sky for weather signs, shielding her eyes from the sun's glare with her hand. When she sighted the first saucer over the City Hall on June 25, 1950, she called her ceramics class out to watch, and hailed the firemen and police across the street along with the mayor, Fred Pearson. The excitement spread, and within a few minutes, much of the town was watching. When it left, it departed in an upward blaze of instant acceleration. Mother said they were like \"new silver dollars\", and I distinctly remember her comparing them to her sewing machine bobbin, which meant the flat, shiny, \"disk\" type with peripheral groove. On the next day, the same sequence occurre d, only with two saucers appearing and maneuvering for around thirty minut es, then departing very fast as before. In each case, the description sounded as if the crews had experi enced malfunctions, or were lost, which were responsible for the saucers being there in the first place, rather than over White Sands or Alamogordo. I later determined that these first saucers appeared to be of a sleek, silvery, slightly older \"disk\" type of WW II-vintage German design of the electric type, not similar in any way to the dumpy and \"top-like\" kind often shown in pulp magazines. It was my opinion at the time, that they were preparing these saucers for observational use in Korea. I was disgruntled that I had not seen them, b ecause I just happened to be out of town, although I was only a short distance south of White Sands, and only a little over a hundred miles to the west of Kermit at the time, in the Davis Mountains. I \"debriefed\" everyone I could find, including my friend Ken Burroughs, who was a competent young photographer who had photographed them Air Force Intelligence showed up, paid Ken $250.00 for his photos, prints and negatives, and made him sign a security documen t. Needless to say, the photos were never published. That was a lot of money for a teenager in 1952, for a few snapshots. By that time, I had designed over 250 different types of experimental aircraft, rockets, cars, and even boats, and had built and tested numerous models of them. As previously mentioned, I had also built a couple of propeller-driven model fl ying saucers, and already knew that props, jets, and rockets were not the means of propulsioa In 1955, my fa ther accidentally included my portfolio of designs in a collection of unwanted furniture he carted away and sold to a junk store, when we moved to Waco. It was possible that some of my designs found their way into the rocket and aircraft fields, judging from material I saw when I worked in Air Force Intelligence in 1957, since my book containing them was purchased from the junk dealer, whose store was right on Highway 302, before I could get it back MY FIRST DAYLIGHT SIGHTING In late summer, 1953, just before school began, we had our last family ice cream party of the summer, in our back yard Home made ice cream had been a tradition in our family for as long as I can remember. There were my parents, Raymond a nd Caleista, my older sister, Ramona, and my younger sister, Liz. Liz sat on a towel placed on top of the larg e, wood-sided, old fashioned, three-gallon ice cream freezer, as I turned the cra nk, while my father chopped ice and fed salt into the brine. The ice cream was almost ready, and I could barely turn the crank We were joined by the young daughter of our neighbor, Allen Pike, a fo rmer fullback at T.C.U. Pike's daughter, Carla, had been wistfully looking through the fence, her mouth watering at die possibility of eating some of my mother's delicious peach ice cream, so we inv ited her over to join us. We were also joined by our tenants, the Humphries. Mr. Humphries was a leather-faced tool push er for a local drilling ALIENS71"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"company, and Mrs. Humphries still carried hers elf with the demeanor of her former wartime occupation as an officer in the \"W.A.C.s\" (Women's Army Air Corps). She had eyes like a hawk, and had already been an expert shot with pistol and rifle, before she took up and mastered the twin 50 caliber machine gun. She had light brown hair, and a beautiful aquiline profile like that of a Kiowa princess, similar to that of my Aunt Sina. She worked as a substitute teacher in our junior high school, and had also been the former WWII Chief of Aerial Gunnery Instruction, at the U.S. Army Air Corps Aerial Gunnery School, at Sarasota, Florida, at the rank of captain. Whenever our B-17 bomber crews took gun-camera film of any new German aircraft, such as the infamous \"foo fighters\", she was among the first to know, since it was her duty to immediately develop and integrate into her gunnery training program, whatever new instructions required, to insure that our gunners were prepared to defend our bombers from any new forms of enemy assault. She was therefore not only a qualified expert aircraft spotter and identifier, but was the chief American gunnery instructor as well. I myself had practically memorized Jane's Handbook of the Aircraft of the World, and had discussed ai rcraft on several occasions w ith Mrs. Humphries, who had observed with a cool, detached candor, my construc tion of flying model saucers, and experiments in electromagnetism. The time of day was near sundown, with the late August sun around 15 degrees above the horizon on the right, to the west of our yard. We sat near our rear fence, as little Carla, around seven, sat nearby. As I struggled with the increasingly stubborn crank, while Liz tried to hold the freezer down, and the dasher trudged through the ever-thickening ice cream, I happened to glance up at the sky above Liz's head, in the direction of a nearby ne w water tower to the south of the town's old one. To my amazement, hovering there, at an angl e of around 45 degrees above our position, at a distance of around 300 feet and an altitude of about 200 feet, was a flying saucer. The saucer was precessing at an acute angle of around 45 degrees, at a frequency of around two cycles per second. Sunlight, from the horizon to our right, shimmered across the striated, silvery, bright metal hull, on each precession. A vi sual comparison to the water tower near and to the rear of the saucer, showed its diameter to be close to 50 feet. Its shape consisted of two evenly curved semispheres joined at the edges. This was unlike the earlier, 1950 versions seen by my mother and sisters. A cloud of \"corona\"—high vol tage electricity emitted by the hull—throbbed orange-pinkishly with each precessi on, and scintillated into ghostly, silvery blue in the surrounding space, as a gentle westerly breeze wafted the coronal clouds softly about. The two entirely symmetrical, \"wok-like\" halves, each having an arc of approximately 120' radius of curvature, formed a ship approximately 10' thick. The high angle precession created an initial op tical illusion, which explained why my mother had mistakenly thought the saucers she saw in 1950 were flipping like coins, end-over-end, while hovering. Mother's sightings were in the early af ternoon, with the sun almost directly above her saucers, producing a silhouette effect. This created an inverse illusion, by the large angle precession of the elliptical shapes under those lighting conditions. The low angle of the sun during my sighting, however, and the shimmering sunlight dancing across what appeared to be a spun metal hull, which was highly reflective, as the sa ucer precessed, produced a clear picture of the movement and shape. Even so, I too was initially baffled until I established the proper movement. The coronal discharge and scintillating, rainbow-colored clouds produced, added a beautiful, ALIENS72"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"ghostly \"special effect\" to the ship. It was easy to understand why many viewers might get excited by \"extraterrestrials\", since the event was almost, but not quite, unearthly. I immediately exclaimed, \"Look at that flying saucer up there!\" Everyone looked to see it, except Mrs. Humphries, who only allowed her eyes to dart once at it, instead of staring at the saucer. She was more interested in viewing me from my left, as I looked back and forth between the saucer and her, attempting to get her to look at it. I asked her, \"What is that?!\" She merely cocked a knowing and sophisticated left eyebrow, and shrugged After perhaps ten seconds of hovering, the saucer began to move slowly at first, due west, toward Ft. Bliss and the southern extreme of White Sands Missile Range. It left a 'buttermilk' trail of silvery, scintillating atmospheric ions, which lingered and sparkled, gr adually fading away. As the rate of acceleration and frequency of precession increased, the angle of precession decreased to a mere high-frequency wobble, as it suddenly shot forward to hundreds of miles per hour, at which time it made a 90 degree turn down and a second ri ght angle back to horizontal, then accelerated to infinity, in approximately three seconds, as I c ounted off \"...thousand-and-one, thousand-and-two, thousand-and-three...\". I roughly calculated the velocity at near 9,000 m.p.h., based on an approximately 7.5 miles distance required for a 50-foo t diameter object to become an infinite point above the horizon, in three seconds. This was a mi nimum calculation, which I believe was fairly accurate. My eyesight was at leas t 20/30 at the time. The rapid cha nge to lower altitude seemed designed to diminish the visibility of the ship by the public, when the flight crew suddenly realized that they were over a town. There was no sonic boom, perhaps because such rapid acceleration gave a boom insufficient time to develop, and other reasons which I was bound to discover. There were no obvious protuberances or windows that I could see on its surface. It was as if, at high speed, the pilots—who may have had relatively primitive navigational, flight control, and visibiliiy devices—had accidentally strayed ove r our town, or malfunctioned, requiring some re-orientation to get the saucer back to their base at Ft. Bliss or in New Mexico, which, at that speed, would have taken every bit of 1.93 minutes to reach. I later satisfied myself by concluding that it was a German pilot instructing an American pilot, on how to operate the saucer. Due to poor visibility on the early model, they may not have realized that they were over a town, and when they had, they rapidly departed In that ar ea, at that time, one could fly for miles over the barren Southwestern landscape, wi thout seeing a town or persoa The most significant 'surprise'—aside from the electrical corona discharge—was the precession and its particularities. Since it was most pronounced when the saucer was hovering, I considered the phenomenon as being closely linked to the power level, in which the ship was on the balance between \"gravity\" and \"no gravity\", during which the circling polarity of the accompanying magnetic field created by the electric currents, swept around counter-clockwise, as well as I remember it, thus creating a minimal sw eeping gravitational pull. The fact that the ship quietly hovered, dispelled the idea that jet, rocket, or propeller-driven propulsion was involved, and indicated an anti-gravitational propulsion by electrical means. I entertained the idea that the 'gyscopic' action of the ship may have been due to an internal device, such as an engine, which rotated Since the ship processed while hovering, like a gyroscope on gimb als, any considerable rotating machinery could have produced the gyroscopic precession. This was consistent with the idea that a rotating engine and electrical ge nerator caused the precession, since the rate of precession increased, while the angle of precession decreased, as the saucer's acceleration ALIENS73"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"increased. The idea that the propulsion system was \"gyroscopic\" was negated by the fact that the turn was perpendicular to the (vertical) axis of gyroscopic precession, and was a \"power turn\". The answers to all my questions were delivered by my flying saucer, in as glorious a manner as one could rationally hope for, and then some. While I knew at the time that the propulsion system was electrical, it would take me many years to discover exactly how the \"electro-physics\" applied. There we were having our last ice cream supp er of the summer of 1953, near dusk, on a lovely end-of-the-summer day. And just as the i ce cream had thickened to its final state, and I happened to look at the sky above my sister's head, there it was, ghostily gyrating in mid-air, no more than 300 feet away, as the beautiful wisps of electrical corona drifted across the metallic shell and into the air, then faded with a twinkle, like stardust from a magic wand which had just passed across the sky. I observed the colors of the corona at hovering power, which ranged from a bright white, through every color of the rainbow. Generally, the color was a \"pink and blue\", with gold highlights and purple undertones. The corona was not too unlike the flame produced by burning zinc, such as when a welding torch was being used to cut galvanized steel pipe. Very beautiful. The corona was emitted from the entire shell at hovering, with a negative corona at the top, as the wind blew gently from the left. Each time the saucer precessed, the wind wafted the corona around on the surface and in the air. The gyrating saucer reminded me of a precessing gyroscope. But the saucer shell itself did not rotate, and the corona did not come out of vents, because there were none. The air in contact with the surface fluoresced orange-red, in \"throbs\", which corresponded to each cycle of the saucer's precession, on its bottom as it turned into the wind from the left and in shadow, away from the sunlight from the right. I concluded that the 'throbs' were probably due to the increased visibility of the corona in the shadow, due to the increased light contrast. This created the illusion that the corona came in 'throbs' wh ich corresponded exactly to the precession, which was only the product of the relative light and dark which revealed the corona more in the dark. The corona was still there on the light side of the sa ucer, only you couldnt see it because the light was too bright. The precession generally matched that which I had experienced in a friend's new 1954 Buick, at 120 mph. As the car approached 120, it began to precess, as it sped down the highway, rolling around on the coil springs, which scared us a bit. At that speed, the angle of precession was at its maximum, and the precession frequency was at its minimum, of approximately 2 c.p.s. As we passed through 120, and sped up to 135, the pr ecessional angle decreased , and the precessional frequency increased, until it was a mere \"shimmy\", behaving in much the same manner as the saucer. In fact, we were greatly relieved to be traveling at 135 rather than 120, where the precession was so scary. At very high speed, the two turns which the sa ucer had executed were precise, square ones, and it did not 'swing out' at the corners. This boggled the eyes, since one never sees things do that, except on some mechanical devices, which hold m oving parts into position with rigid guides. At hundreds of miles per hour, the effect was eer ie. The movement indicated that the saucer experienced none of the effects of momentum a nd inertia, and therefore operated on a principle which controlled these forces, and created 'synth etic', instantaneous momentum by increasing in the new direction of acceleratioa Since the forwar d edge emitted a 'hairy' (i.e., negative) corona during the rapid acceleration, the electrical polarity was indicated . Since the ship made instant ALIENS74"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"square turns which were perpendicular to its vertical axis, the idea of an internal \"gyroscopic\" drive system was contraindicated. There was no sound, hence no perceptible aerodynamic or \"Coanda\" effects. The saucer accelerated much faster than a jet, rocket or propeller-driven craft could have, and had no visible or audible jets or rockets, orifices, pods, intakes, or shapes. It went from a half mile away to infinity in three seconds, appearing to have achieved a 9,000 m.p.h. velocity almost instantly, although it could have been as high as 25,000 mph. The metallic shell was similar in color to aluminum, only somewhat duller, with concentric striations on its surface, like a 'spun' \"wok\" shape. The striations were approximately 1\" wide and rather crude, indicating perhaps a technical difficulty in fabrication, such as that experienced in early, large-scale \"spin-forming\" of the shells on very large vertical lathes, using new, special tungsten alloy discs. A friend, who had worked in a secret government factory, in Amarillo, Texas, in the '50s, described how they fabricated such semi-spheres around 50' in diameter in that same manner. The shells were then shipped to New Me xico. When one of the work crew asked what they were for, he was told they were \"shells for flying saucers\", and everyone had a good laugh. As the saucer precessed, sunlight played across the striations on the bottom, like it does on the microgrooves of a silvery compact disc, or of an aluminum pan. I had made the rough estimate of its diameter by visual comparison to the new city water tower behind it and slightly to the right. The approximate height through the center was visually extrapolated from the diameter, together with the proportionate spherical sections used, and the height-to-diameter proportionality. What I saw in 1953 was a flying machine. The most irrational assumption would have been that it was \"extraterrestrial\" in origin. The most rational assumption was that it was made by human beings, and that was my first impression. The puzzle parts I had gathered that day, added to what I already had, eventually grew, until I had enough to fit together to substantiate what I believed on my first impressioa There were many sightings occurring at that general period of time, especially in that area. That particular saucer was noted by Wink Air Station, about 10 miles away, according to my brother-in-law's relative, who worked there. Wink Air Station was south of the flight path, which was on a bee-line precisely due west toward the northern edge of Ft. Bliss, Texas, where Wernher von Braun was at that time. Had I not been viewing the saucer while it hovered, and its flight to the horizon, almost directly along its trajectory, it might not have been visible. As I thought about the performance characteristics, 1 concluded that the field of aerodynamics would soon become obsolete. This led me to abandon my plans to become an aerodynamicist, although I still wanted to be an aeronautical e ngineer. After all, the saucer was powered by electricity, had canceled inertia, momentum and gravity, made no sonic boom, and apparently ignored aerodynamics. I assumed the aircraft was clas sified at the time, but that it would only be a matter of no more than five to ten years before it would be declassified, just as other aircraft had been. At the time, I assumed that the general public would be using flying saucers by 1960. How wrong this turned out to be! The longer I waite d, the more I became determined to know why. In 1953, at the time of my sighting, I assu med that the saucer was a \"secret government project\". By 1963, I confirmed instead that it was a \"Secret Government\" project, and began viewing all government statements as being intended to maintain that secrecy. By that time, I also assumed that the Soviets did not have the saucer, as we knew it, even though Habermohl, SPACE ALIENS75"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"purportedly one of the top German flying saucer scientists, had gone to the Russians in 1945, and we ended up with Miethe and Schriever. Neither of these two men appeared to have anything to do with the electrically-powered saucers, and their projects were probably misinformational. I eventually considered the assumption that the Sovi ets also had the saucer even more improbable, hinging\" on the question as to whether or not Habermohl had access to the particular secrets involved, and whether he told the Soviets about them if he did. It is more probable that Habermohl, whose ideas were of the lowest order in the \"flying saucer hierarchy\", was purposefully 'sacrificed' to the Russians to mislead them, and that the Russians incorrectly assumed that he would have told them everything he knew, while he may have given them only misinformation. The CIA could have put a lot of money in a Swiss bank account for him, while the Soviets continued to treat him like a king. Besides, the kind of saucers under development by Habermohl and Schriever were of the jet and rocket powered \"boundary layer\" type, not the electric type, and really posed no risk to the \"real\" \"p2\" flying saucer, based on Nikola Tesl a's original discoveries, acquired by the Nazis and purportedly being developed by Miethe, under von Braun's immediate supervision, from his research and development centers at Peenemunde and in Bavaria. The Nazis were very shrewd, developing se veral different types of saucers—some aerodynamic, but only one electrical—at different locations using different designers, but they would never have developed the \"r eal\" (\"KT-p2\") electrically powered saucer outside Germany, such as in Czechoslovakia, where Habermohl and Schriever worked. The Czech projects appeared to be purely disinformational. It is probable that the only military organization made privy to all these secrets was the SS, as suggested by evidence purportedly from Wiener Neustadt, in the Austrian Bavarian Alps, and at General Otto Skorzeny's special SS commando headquarters near Munich Skorzeny's groups' specialties included re scues. The saucers were purportedly viewed by the SS mythically, as the Vimanas of the SS Aryan philosopher-rulers, according to the neo-Platonist Nazi religion. There has been a very carefully executed conspir acy to conceal real photos of what I call \"real flying saucers\"—those of the purely \"electro-propulsive\" type—from the public. The O.S.I, has seen to it that many fake photos and configurations have been 'inserted' into the mainstream, to confuse the public not only as to the real shape of these saucers, but to the means of propulsion. I have encountered very sly O.S.I, attempts to propagate the idea—with in more 'intelligent' \"UFOlogy\" circles—that the Felix Schauberger designs (which were non-electro-propulsive, claiming use of an \"implosion turbine\"-driven 'duct fan', which put them definitely in the \"low-tec\" category, somewhere in the category of a glorified air conditioner vent)—were the kind developed by the Nazis. From the numerous photos of flying saucers—some real, some fabricated—it is difficult to determine with relati ve certainty the stages of development which the 'true saucer' has undergone. Many of the photos are obviously hoaxes, and all the types proffered by the \"German-genesis\" bunch are disinformational, or based on data derived from CIA- generated disinformational sources, so I will try to show you what I saw in 1953, and you can draw your own conclusions. The illustration shown below should give you some idea of what the particular type of saucer I saw looked like: ALIENS76"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" I knew by the way that the sau cer could 'jump around' in space, that it's gravity was being controlled. Otherwise, it would have flown to pieces, and any pilot would have been slammed around so badly that he would have been injure d and rendered unconscious by the \"G\" forces. I knew from the electrical corona, and the 'buttermilk' te xture of its corona trail, that the means for controlling gravity high voltage electricity, a nd included at least some sort of high frequency electricity. I knew also that the saucer disobeye d conventional rules of gravity, inertia, momentum, aerodynamics, aeronautics, and physics. A rounded surface will hold charges better than those of a small diameter or sharp points or edges, which will 'leak' charges more quickly, an d cause corrosion and burns. A corner of 90 degrees or more, will reflect waves being emitte d from the top or bottom. This to me explained some of the saucer's physical shape parameters . The emissions seemed to originate on the top surface on hovering—with positive corona on its bottom—and at the front when accelerating. In attempting to analyze the cause for the precession, I concluded after many years of deliberation, that it was not caused by a 'spinning' mass inside the saucer, such as a gyroscope or ALIENS77"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"motor, or the saucer itself, but was caused by the same unidentified, underlying reason that spinning objects precess, in an electromagnetic in teraction between the mass of the saucer and something in the space in which it operated. The precession of tops and gyroscopes as they spin, compared to the saucer's precession, since it was not spinning—was caused by some underlying common principle. There was a guidance syst em Meisterkreiselkompass (\"master-gyro- compass\"), to work with the Peiltochterkompa ss (\"polar-slave-compass\" ), a control device from a German inertial guidance system I would later acqu ire, as the only piece of physical evidence—a part from a flying saucers—in private hands—my hands—thus far. The Meisterkompass would have been on gimbals, and would not have related to the precession. The electrically powered \"Kreisel Teller\" (\"Gyrating Saucer\") was a secret of such importance that only the elite of the Nazi hierarchy were privy to these secrets. Adam Weishaupt's Illuminati beginnings were at Ingolstadt. The Illuminati appeared to be alive and well even before Weishaupt, among the Prussian aristocracy into which Wernher von Braun was born. I will have more to say about this later. I MEET THE K.G.B. AND CAPTAIN MANTELL'S WINGMATE IN THE U.S. AIR FORCE In late 1955 the Korean War came to an end. In June, 1956, at age seventeen, at the end of my junior year, I decided to drop out of high school and get my \"military obligation\" out of the way—preferably before the Military Industrial Co mplex could start another war. I didn't want to live through my twenties with that uncertainty continually hanging over my head, with the possibility that I might have to interrupt whatever I might be doing at that time. Somehow, I was offered a presidential appointment to the Air Force Academy, by President Eisenhower. Unfortunately, he wasn't aware that I was a high school drop-out, while the Air Force failed to inform me that the obstacle could have been surmounted by a G.E.D. test. Meanwhile, I also wanted to be in the Air Force Band, but there were no new assignments. I was offered the position of first bugler for the National Drum and Bugle Corps, in Washington, D.C., but at the time, my disappointment over not being in the Air Force Band was so great, I failed to investigate the bugle corps offer and what a great opportunity it represented, and turned it down. This was while I was in basic training, when I was in th e Lackland A.F.B. Drum and Bugle Corps, where I was first bugler. Second bugler was my best fri end at the time, Kris Kristofferson, who was quickly appointed as \"barracks chief, because he had two years of RO.T.C. at Pomona College. My other good friend was Eddie Heywood, of Boston, Mass. Kris' father was Army brass, and Eddie's older brother, Tom, was a Navy commander. Eddie's lather was an M.I.T. chemistry professor. I had been a Navy brat during WW II, so we all sort of fell in together and got along well. Kris and I had both gone out with the same girl, named Marilyn Wood, of Donna, Texas, who was the National F.F.A. \"Sweetheart\" aroun d 1956. Those farmers couldn't have picked a better girl, even though she liked musicians. Kris and 1 reciprocated for base reville and taps. We had a crack marching and performance group, and had some excellent Caribbean drummers , as well as a bagpiping member of the Black Watch of Scotland, on loan to us from the RC.A.F. Kris was awaiting an application to Annapolis, and had another application in for flight school just in case. After disc overing that I wouldn't be ab le to accept the A.F. Academy ALIENS78"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"appointment, and that no band positions were open, I decided that jet mechanics would be a good job, and would prepare me for my planned career in aeronautical design and engineering. I already knew that I was a mechanical whiz-kid, and didn't anticipate any problems on my tests. Besides, good jet mechanics were in short supply in the Ai r Force at the time. Eddie wanted to be a tow-reel operator, because of the extra hazardous duty pay, then just wanted to go back to being a civilian again. When we finally got to our testing phase, I came away feeling good about my tests, even though I was rather exhausted at the time I took them . Later, we were given our files by the testing personnel, and ordered to deliver them to the counseling and classification section. There, an airman first class told us we were not to look at our test scores until the following week, when we were scheduled to meet with the counselors for ca reer counseling and job classification and training purposes. I considered the order too suspicious to obey, so the minute the airman first's head was turned, I disobeyed, opened my file, and recorded my stanine scores on my pith helmet. Mechanics (95) was my highest, with administration (45) my lowest score, with the rest of my scores graduated evenly in between. My A.F.Q.T. (Armed Forces Qualification Test), taken in Dallas when I enlisted, was 97, placed me in the top 1 %. The following week, when our files were returned to us, my scores had been reversed, making me look like a potential administrative whiz. There were, I noticed, five classification men working closely together in a suspicious way, and I alread y had reason for my suspicions, because they had reversed my scores. I didn't tell the counselor I knew my test scores had been reversed, and discovered several other similar obvious discrepa ncies with my comrades. The personnel man refused to consider assigning me to jet mechanics, because of my \"low mechanical aptitude\", and insisted on placing me in Ground Control and Approach, an air traffic and control job which required a high administrative aptitude, and involve d a highly responsible and critical job landing aircraft under hazardous conditions. In other words, he had not only misclassified me, but had placed me in a critical field in which a single admini strative error, such as assigning two aircraft the same altitude, etc., could cost millions of dollars and several lives. I already knew that the changes in my scores were made after the records had been turned over to the classification personnel, who therefore were the responsible parties in all likelihood. On return to our barracks, I made a rapid survey of others to see how they had fared, bearing in mind that our records had been sabotaged. There were several men scheduled for counterinteUigence, some to be sent to Harvar d, Yale, Dartmouth, and other schools with good Slavic language programs. I assumed that many of these assignments were misclassifications, based on sabotaged scores that made the airmen involved appear to have a higher aptitude for languages than they actually had. As I later disc overed, while my scores were merely reversed, those of some others' were juxtaposed in di fferent order, or graded upward or downward. Among the airmen being sent to counterintelligence was a young Bulgarian who was a trustworthy friend, who had been recruited just for that purpose by U.S. Intelligence. He was a fine person, whose family had been slaughtered by the Communists. The classifications personnel had probably taken a wide berth with him, but had probably blown his cover. Another guy, who claimed to be from Florida—which I did not be lieve, and neither did the Bulgarian—was also classified into counterintelligence. He had the same rosy cheeks and Slavic mouth as my boyhood friend, Rudolf, who was a first generation Czech-Americaa I consu lted with the Bu lgarian, and then with Eddie, and finally with Kris, who was knowledgeable about military affairs and ALIENS79"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"procedures. Kris recommended that I report my findings to the adjutant. By that time, the personnel saboteurs had continued to do their damage, and had even managed to cut a set of travel orders sending me to Air Police School in Compton, California, even though I was assigned to G.C.A. school at Keesler A.F.B., Mississippi, near Biloxi. I told the adjutant that I had found what I believed to be a 5-man K.G.B. cell operating in the Air Force Career Counseling Center at Lackland, and that they had probably already routed a Czech mole into counterintelligence. The adjutant straightened out my travel orders, and said he would have the matter looked into. Months later, Naval Commander Thomas W. Heywood—Eddie's older brother—on behalf of O.N.I., came to Keesler to spend four days over Thanksgiving, 1956, with Eddie and I. He said his reason for coming involved the K.G.B. cell, informing me for the first time that the F.B.I., acting on my information, had uncovered them Tom said he had reason to believe that the K.G.B. was responsible for certain problems I was having, and that he would see what he could do to get me out of trouble. He said that Eisenhower had transferred the bunch to the Army where they could be more closely watched. The entire incident was cl assified \"Confidential\", and Tom was breaking the rules by even discussing the matter with me. I received the same confirmation from the squadron adjutant and commander, and was also clandestinel y visited by Air Force Intelligence and D.I.A. people, who were trying to help me, while the Air Force officially refused to do anything. About that time, Arthur C. Clarke, head of the British Interplanetary Society, and a big friend to Wernher von Braun, came to Keesler to give a lecture on \"Unidentified Aerial Phenomena\", which I attended. Clarke concluded that flying saucers did not exist as such, and that all such sightings could be explained as natural phenomena. After his address, I filed through a line to speak to him. I shook his hand and told him, \"Dr. Clarke, I enjoyed your speech, but both you and I know that you are a goddamned liar, and that flying saucers are man-made flying machines powered by electricity.\" Clarke chuckled and shoo k my hand. Two days later, I was reclassified into intelligence, as a clerk- typist, of all things (there was the uncorrected high score in administration speaking again, which the Air Force refused to correct). Both Eddie and I went to 8th A.F., S.A.C., Headquarters, 26th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing, Lockbourne, A.F.B., Ohio, near Columbus. I was then processed and cleared for Top Secret. It seemed an odd coincidence that the 8th Air Force intelligence group to which I was attached was the same one which had encountered the first a llied air assaults of the German flying saucers, and was also somewhat involved in Operation Paperclip. While at Lockbourne, in late 1957, 1 met a lieutenant colonel named A. W. Clements who was on T.D.Y. there, who had been one of the lieutenants who were Captain Mantell's wingmates, at the time of the Jan. 7, 1948 incident near Mayville, Kentucky, involving a flight out of Godman A.F.B. Flight Commander Thomas Mantell, Jr., led his P-51s in pursuit of a flying saucer. His plane was completely destroyed and Mantell with it . The later account by J. Allen Hynek, in his \"Operation Blue Book\" report, was almost complete ly different from the one given to me by Lt. Col. Clements. The situation gave me cause to wonder that, should others have followed up on Hynek's footsteps on all the other reports he supposedly considered, that almost just so many other errors might not emerge, showing a consistent pattern of lies. The way I came to meet Clements, a tall ma n with dark wavy hair, was because of a discussion—actually more of an argument—which I was having with a couple of intelligence officers, one a major and the other a captaia I was making my argument on flying saucers, and ALIENS80"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"they were calling me crazy, saying flying saucers were either 'aerial phenomena' or non-existent. The colonel came down the stairs, introduced himself, and said he was on T.D.Y. at Lockbourne for a couple of weeks, (from either Kentucky or Wright-Patterson, I don't recall for certain). He said he couldn't help but overhear our argument, an d said he was taking my side. He told us he had been Captain Mantell's wingmate in the 1948 disaster, and gave a blow-by-blow account of the incident, which significantly differed with the account written by Hynek when they spotted the saucer, and immediately commenced pursuit under standing orders, they contacted the control tower at Godman. Mantell led the way, and was close to the saucer. The control tower patched them through to the Pentagon, which ordered th em to immediately cease pursuit. Clements said that he was unable to make radio contact with Mant ell, because of the strong electric field near the saucer, so Mantell continued the pursuit, within th e colonel's view. Mantell's plane flew into tiny pieces and Mantell with it. There was no eviden ce or sighting of any weapons use. The two officers who were arguing with me had to eat crow , for there was a superior officer having direct personal knowledge of flying saucers, in a famous incident, to corroborate my argument. 1 thanked Clements for his honesty. The two other officers didn't call him crazy. My theory is that Mantell's plane, at 500 mph ., entered the saucer's electric field, which gravitationally neutralized the front of the plane. As soon as his plane lost its charge, the front and rear of the plane shredded together and apart in every direction, due to the sudden effects of momentum and inertia. The Pentagon's order to cease and desist was heard by Clements, but not by Mantell, and must have been intended to av oid such an incident, based on prior knowledge by Pentagon personnel as to what c ould happen. Otherwise, there is no case in which the Pentagon has ever ordered the U.S.A.F. to cease pursuit of any \"unidentified\" aircraft, while flying over the continental U.S.A. The parts of Hynek's report wh ich were false, due to critical omissions and misrepresentations—since Clements told his story to me the same as he told Hynek—were related to the facts that they clearly pursued a flying sau cer, that Clements was in view of Mantell's plane at the time of the explosion, that radio contact had been obviously broken with Mantell due to the electric field of the saucer, and that the Pentagon had caEed off the pursuit immediately on notification, prior to the incident. This incident has been rehashed over and over, and Clements was very clear on the fact that it was a flying saucer , and not a \"weather balloon\" as the government later tried to fabricate. On the night of Nov. 2,1957, while I was on leave from the Air Force, visiting at my parent's home in Odessa, Texas, my father was returning from a marketing trip, en route to Odessa. Just after passing through LeveEand, Te xas after dark, his 1957 ford staEed and aE Eghts went out, and he had to coast to a stop in the dark, on the highway shoulder. He rolled down his window and felt a rush of air, while over his car, a flying saucer hovering only a few feet above. He sat there for around fifteen minutes before the saucer finaEy departed In essence, he had been \"arrested\" during that time. Afterwards, he was able to restart his engine, but his lights were gone, so he returned cautiously in the dark to a Levelland motel, where he spent the remainder of the night. The following morning, at first light, he drove on to Odessa, where he ate a quick breakfast and went immediately to SeweE Ford to have his lights repaired, saying nothing about the flying saucer. After he left, I turned on the T.V. for the morning news, which included the well-known report about the Levelland saucers, including an interview with the sheriff of Hockley County. I immediately went to Sewell Ford to talk to my father. ALIENS81"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"The Sewell Ford repair shop had just opened, and the mechanic was just beginning to check out the lights, as my father stood close by. I asked Dad about the flying saucer, and he asked how I knew about it. He was unaware that there were news reports concerning other sightings and incidents around Levelland the previ ous night. He said he had said nothing about it because he didn't want to be called \"crazy\". The saucer was \"egg-shaped\", about 200 feet long, and glowed in the dark. The mechanic said he'd never seen a car with every single light bulb blown out, without there being a blown fuse or any other evidence of a short or other electrical malfunction. I suggested that the tungsten fila ments were damaged because th e strong electric field around the saucer had caused the filaments to burn out or br eak, as the weakest links in the circuits, already weakened by their white-hot temperatures, when the saucer hovered over the car. The magnetic field in the car, induced by the strong electric field of the saucer, would cause the electrons in the light filament and circuitry to spin like crazy. I left the Air Force in 1958, because the classification errors made by the K.G.B. in 1956 had led to an impasse, in which I eventually could not be upgraded in the field in which I was working—in Special Services P.C.U. (Physical Conditioning and Judo Unit)—until I had first been upgraded in my primary A.F.S.C., which was as an illustrator in Intelligence. The Air Force had refused to correct my test scores so that I could be classified into a field consistent with my real aptitudes. Meanwhile, Intelligence decided they want ed me back, after I had trained in the P.C.U. Using their 'secret' influence, Intelligence got the classification officer who was to officially assign the P.C.U. classification number to me after training in that field, so I could be upgraded, assign me a primary A.F.S.C. as an illustrator in Intellige nce, with a secondary A.F.S.C. in the P.C.U., so that I could not be upgraded at all, until I had gone back to Intelligence for six months so I could first be upgraded there. This created a \"catch 22\", however, because I had already been in the A.F. for two years and had not been upgraded, so I demanded a discharge under an obscure 8th A.F. Letter, a copy of which was in my possession. The ironic fact was that, not only was I already trained as an illustrator, but there was no one on the base to train me anyway. I had attended night classes at the Columbus College of Art and Design for a year. And now for the incident on the three Russian bombers: When I worked in Intelligence as a clerk-typist, I had 'spontaneously' devised a new briefing system during a \"Red Alert\", called during a snowstorm. I was the only one in my group to show up, and had to brief and debrief the S.A.C. crews before and after takeoff. That al ert concerned three Russian bombers which crossed the Arctic Circle and eventually landed in Minnesota under fighter escort, picked up over Canadian air space. That was the \"Bison, the Bear, and the Muskrat\" incident I refe rred to earlier, being the three latest Russian bombers, flown by three defecting Russian pilots and landed in Minnesota. As far as we knew, it was an attack. The briefing system I devised involved color-coding, in which the map pouches I provided to the pilots identified their primary, secondary, and alternate targets by color code. That system was adopted by S.A.C., as it was very handy under pressure, and the pilots liked it, even though it was a breach of security for me to devise and distribute the system without authority. What else was I to do, since th e responsible intelligence men were still at home hiding under their beds? Only survival officer, Lt. Don Cook and I, did the whole routine with only a skeleton crew. I had picked up what I knew by working in the same room Congress had rejected the plans for the three Russian bombers, so the American designer had sold his plans to the Russians. We had no defense from those planes at that time, since they flew above our missiles.

I later learned that he had became a Rhodes scholar at Oxford, after finishing at Annapolis, after his other application eventually came through. When he appeared as a musician in the '60s, I hardly recognized him, except for his voice and eyes. In 1956, he was rather stocky, wore a burr haircut, and even had those little rolls of fat on the back of his neck I was greatly disappointed in 1996 to learn of his connections to Col.

If I had not stumbled across the KGB. cell, there is no telling how long they might have lasted, right under the noses of our ignorant government bureaucrats, and the fact remains that they might never have been caught. The distinct feeling I got was that I was being punished for turning up this incident, not only by the K.G.B., but by my own government as well, and that the only help I got was from people who were disobeying orders. I never received an official wo rd of thanks from the Air For ce, and got only an unofficial thanks from Tom Heywood, and he was with the Navy! I MEET THE PRESIDENT'S BROTHER-IN-LAW, AND ARNOLD SCHWARTZENEGGER'S FUTURE FATHER-IN-LAW, IN THE PEACE CORPS In 1962, 1 applied for the Peace Corps, on a bet with J. Evetts Haley, the western historian. Our bet was that I would apply for duty in So utheast Asia, and be accepted for South America, based on \"bureaucratic probability \". My application was accepted fo r Ecuador, with training in Puerto Rico. I never tried to collect on the bet, since it was more in the nature of a joke. While in training at Arecibo, and at the Univer sidad Inter Americano at Barranquitas, Puerto Rico, I had some rather noteworthy experiences. Beginning at Arecibo, I was under close scrutiny for some reason unknown to me at the time. This immediately followed a fiery speech by Fidel Castro of Cuba, in which he accused the Peace Corp s of being a front for the CIA. I was followed around by certain administrative people, and even treated rather hostilely. Finally, R. Sargent Shriver, brother-in-law to President John F. Kennedy, came for a visit, and hung out with me over several days. Everyone knew who he was, even though he used a phony name. One volunteer even sculpted a limestone portrait of him. He was checking me out for some unknown reason, and seemed disconcerted that we agreed on so many things. My friend, Dr. A. Henry Sara-Nee, of Midland, Texas, had been a graduating classmat e of his at Yale Law School, class of '47. It was near this time that an old Puerto Rican man, who smuggled back and fourth to Cuba in his row boat, most urgently approached me at a rural cantina, to give me information. The story 1 Cathy O'Brien with Mark Phillips, Trance Formation of America, Reality Marketing, Inc., Las Vegas, NV (1995) ALIENS83"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"that he related to me indicated that he had observed the Russians building what I knew from his description were nuclear missile silos, equipped with I.C.B.M.S. This was the first information picked up in the \"Cuban Missile Crisis\", and I passed the information along, after which it was verified by intelligence people. The missiles were actually there, contrary to later false reports (supplied by the CIA) that only fake 'mock-up' missiles were in Cuba. They were apparently setting Kennedy up, and I knew it, the American public be damned. It was also near this time mat I was harasse d by Peace Corps bureaucrats, because a friend and I had Puerto Rican girl friends. The friend was a Black guy named Bill, who had won the Medal of Honor in the Korean War, as a tank commander. The Peace Corps officials particularly wanted me to stop seeing my girlfriend, a school teacher named Maria, because her brother was the secretary to the Bishop of Ponce, who had called Munoz Marin a communist Maria had participated in freedom rides in the southern U.S., and I thought it odd that Peace Corps officials should be guilty of such bigotry and weirdness. Didn 't these guys ever see West Side Story? They were acting like \"Officer Krupke\". I was finally 'selected out' of the Peace Corps, without any reason being given. It would not be until four years later that I would learn why. In protest to the Peace Corps having 'separating me out', a group Barranquitas citizens showed up with placards, in my support. They we re Puerto Ricans I'd become acquainted with, including my girlfriend, her chaperone, and several others. I thanked them for their sympathy, and said my goodbyes to them, after which we were taken to the San Juan airport, thence flown back to the U.S. Though the group had little money, they later very sweetly took up a donation and sent a small gift of money and a nice card, after I reached home. As I was preparing to depart the training facility at the Universadad Inter Americano at Barranquitas, I was offered some damaging info rmation on Peace Corps operations, from several people whom I had already identified as CIA agents. The information ranged from the fact that our \"dance teacher\" was paid $120.00 per day, to the fact that many of the male officials abused their positions by demanding 'bed time' with some of the female recruits. What I also thought was very odd, was the fact that nearly all the Peace Corps of ficials and other trainees had almost nothing to do with the Puertoriquenos, and were discouraged from doing so. At the forefront of this attitude, were some people from the Union Theological Seminary. When I reached home, I was surprised to have some media people very anxi ous to 'expose' the Peace Corps operations. I attributed this to CIA orchestration as well. Thanks to Walter Bowart, I read in 1994 that, according to The Report from Iron Mountain (purportedly an accidentally leaked paper of th e Secret Government) that war is considered a desirable component of modern society to reduce population, and to control \"..dangerous social dissidence and destructive anti-social tendencies\". Th e military is considered a pool for \"misfits...a state-supported haven for the unemployable\". They conceived of the Peace Corps as a model for an alternative replacement for the non-military function s of war, to sociologically control \"misfits\" ...as a \"modern sophisticated form of slavery\", motivated by a) \"inten sified environmental pollution\", b) \"new religious or other mythologies \", c) \"socially oriented blood games\", or d) \"combination forms\". In respect to my having been \"selected out\" of the Peace Corps (which in view of the above report, was a positive sign), the following copies of letters and documents are included for your reflection: ALIENS84"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":" Please note the evasive language of E. Lowell Kelly 's second paragraph (\"...I see no reason to discuss specific reasons for your separation..\") in response to my letter attempting to find out why I was removed. Kelly mentioned \"Dr. Boulger\", whom he asserted had 'evidently' told me \"quite specifically\" why. To the contrary, Boulger never told me why, even though very nervous, and actually broke down in tears when I asked him for a reason. The only thing I could get out of him was a vague reference to \"...something to do with my military record\". Since everything about my \"\"military record\" had been fully disclosed at the time of my recruitment, the Peace Corps had been fully informed, and there was scarcely any basis for that. I knew that Fidel Castro had delivered fiery damnations of the Peace Corps in his radio broadcasts, which we had listened to, alleging that it was a \"front for the CIA\", but never imagined that I was being set up as a scapegoat. I also knew that two of my fellow recruits— John Bolin and Patricia Cohn—had fraternized with two of Castro's spies, when they had approached the training facility and entered it, just prior to those broadcasts. I also knew that Bolin and Cohn were CIA agents, along with John Barrett and a ma n named Salazar. It wasn't until four years later that I would realize what Bolin and Cohn had told Castro's agents, that I was a CIA agent. In retrospect, I knew one of the men associated with the Peace Corp was a Cuban associated with the CIA forces which had attempted to overthr ow Castro. He had brutally raped a friend of mine, a girl from Kentucky. Everyone knew about it, yet no one said anything about it or attempted to rectify it. She had black eyes an d bruises all over her face, was dejected and ashamed, yet nothing was done to the fascist CIA Cuban pig.

ALIENS86"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"I MEET THE CIA, ITS FUTURE DIRECTOR, AND THE FUTURE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S.A., WHILE IN THE UNIVERSITY I picked up bits and pieces of the flying saucer puzzle during my college years, particularly when I took a freshman course in physics, at Sam Houston State University, in Huntsville, Texas, in 1963-64. At that time, I began to see the rela tionship between gravity and charge-to-mass ratio in individual atoms. Later, while I attended a year of law school at U.T.-Austin, in 1965-66, M.B. Wood, the CIA Southwestern Regional Director, gave a recruitment speech to our law class 1 , and said he'd be glad to answer any questions he could, if we would contact his secretary to set up an appointment, which I did. I was surprised to learn that the \"sweetheart\" of our law class, 'Sandy' (Kay) Bailey, was also M.B. Wood's secretar y. (I was not surprised 26 years later, when in 1992 Kay Bailey-Hutchinson became a U.S. senator from Texas.) The meeting was held in a room of the Business and Economics Building, on the U.T. campus. At my meeting with Wood, I asked him point blank if he knew why I was kicked out of the Peace Corps. He reached across the desk for a dossier on me, opened it, and showed me an \"executive edict\" signed by John F. Kennedy, staring that \"...no person who has worked for the CIA may be in the Peace Corps.\" I asked Wood how that applied to me, and he said \"Because Pres ident Kennedy thought you worked for us.\". I then asked Wood if the CIA had permitted Kennedy to believe that, even though it was not true, and he said \"Yes\". Then he proudly showed me anot her executive edict dated around two weeks later, stating that \"...no person who has worked for the Peace Corps may be employed by the CIA.\" Then Wood said, \"However, we'd be glad to consider your application five years from your date of departure from the Peace Corps.\" As I was leaving, Wood said \"Stay dry!\" (old intelligence jargon, meaning \"stay sensitive!\"). The facts were as follows: There I was having a beer at a rural Puerto Rican cantina, listening to accordion music blaring from a Wurlitzer juke box, and just happened to pick up America's first intelligence on the Cuban Missile Crisis. Though I was not a CIA agent, this seemed of considerable importance to me, and I didn't think I should remain silent about it. After all, my family didn't even have a bomb shelter. Besides, I was in Peace Corps training, and the missile silos sounded fairly unpeaceful, so I passed the information along for the benefit of the American People and the world, not the CIA. Castro's radio broadcasts reminded me of Hitler's. This incident proved to me what I had suspected all along, which was that the CIA was not playing it straight with the president, who was their commander-in-chief. If the president could not depend on the veracity of the CIA, as his supposed means of intelligence gathering upon which to base his decisions, then the American people coul d not rely on those decisions as reflecting the rational options available to the president, as betr ayed by the CIA. It stands to John F. Kennedy's credit that he lacked confidence in the CIA, so mu ch that, even after they had scapegoated me, to avoid discovery of the fact that they remained well represented in the Peace Corps in violation of the President's order, that Kennedy sent his own trus ted brother-in-law, Shriver, to see if they were lying to him, which they certainty were. If they had just told me why they were kicking me out, I 1 8, supra. ALIENS87"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"could have fingered Bolin, Cohn, Barrett, and Salazar—who were not separated out—in a few minutes. They had told Castro's spies that I was a CIA agent, and then gave me the damaging material on the Peace Corps as I was departing, obv iously for use in my later interviews with the media, which they had also arranged. It seemed odd to me that the president of the United States did not know who his own CIA agents were, yet I, a civilian, whom he was falsely led to believe was with the CIA, did know who they were. If the CIA answered to a 'higher authority', then this was truly bigger than a \"betrayal\" of or by Kennedy, in his dealings with the Mili tary Industrial Complex. There was John F. Kennedy—a Cambridge-educated Illuminatus (A.K. A. \"Fabian Socialist\")—betraying the Council on Foreign Relations' goal of British-American world imperialism, as envisioned by Cecil Rhodes, the British billionaire who, as an Illuminist, had endowed Oxford's Rhodes Scholarships program, and was a 'world-control' adherent to the ancient teachings of Hermes Trismegistus (\"Thrice Greatest\"), as elucidated by his favorit e Oxford professor, John Ruskin. These teachings say that only an illuminated elite—which maintains a dualistic (\"Hermaphroditic\") difference between what is said and what is done—should rule the world In 1968, while a graduate student in art at U.T., I attended a lecture on gravity in the physics department. I was disappointed to find that the phys icists were still ignorant of the scientific basis for gravity. I was also amazed to find a grant ap plication on the bulletin board, from the U.S. Department of Energy, for prospective PhD. candidates in physics. All the candidates had to do to pick up a $10,000 grant, was to base their theses on the given government premise that \"U.F.O.s are free-floating plasmas.\" This was apparently the manner by which the Trilateral Commission bought phony \"documentation\" to suppor t their BIGGEST LIE, to be la ter used by UFOlogists. It also constituted a prima facie cas e of scholastic dishonesty. I TURN DOWN AN OFFER FROM THE CIA TO BE \"ONCE AND FUTURE KING\" I left the university and my first wife and I divorced in 1970, then I moved to New Mexico. By 1967, 1 had already done sketches of flying saucer control systems, having twelve directional grids, corresponding to twelve 30-degree incremental divisi ons of the compass, such as I had surmised from my 1950s observations of flying saucers navigating in the night sky above our back yard in West Texas. This observation would later be corroborated, at least for the early vintage saucers. In 1973, at the Santa Fe Ski Basin, I ran across some friends whom I had known in my U.T. days, who had belonged to O.S.O. (\"Organization of Students of Objectivism\"), a philosophy club I belonged to which studied the literature and philosophy of Ayn Rand The friends introduced me to a woman who accompanied them. I dated the woman on occasion over tw o years. In 1975, she attended the School of Law at the University of Houston, and lived with her grandmother, in Pasadena, Texas. While visiting her, after my return from a trip to Europe—on which I had embarked on the Kraljevica, a vessel of the Ju golinea—I was rather astounded when she and another vivacious young woman suddenly announced th at they were CIA agents, and said, \"...we are authorized to offer you M.B. Wood's job, with the provision that you return to your wife.\" You could have knocked me over with a feather! Wood was the CIA executive with whom I had met in Austin, concerning the Peace Corps. I turned the offer down. It was odd to discover that a lady you had been seeing for ova two years, was all the while checking you out for the CIA. It was also ALIENS88"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"ironic that I was offered the job of the same CIA employee with whom I had met concerning J.F.K. and the Peace Corps. To make it stranger, the offer came from George Bush, the new head of the CIA, whom I had met and talked to while visiting my first cousin, Patsy, who was his private secretary for five years, at his Tidewater Oil Company office in the Nelly Esperson Building, in Houston. It took me a while to sort out all of the pieces of that little incident. The CIA \"agentrix\" was the first cousin of my first wife's first cousin's wife. That cousin's wife was the sister to a (now retired) Texas Ranger, who presently lives in Sant a Fe. That Ranger had take n a shot at my second wife along highway 285, in October, 1983, to scare the hell out of her. George Bush had just taken over the CIA. The girlfriend had commercial dealings with Bush, as one of the owners of a major oil company. And why did the CIA try to bribe and coerce me back to my first wife? George Bush and my first wife's father we re butt-bumping buddies, in Bush's 1950s Odessa, Texas days. Beginning with George Bush's command at the CIA, my problems began in Lamy, stirred up by the CIA, in order to \"motivate me\" to accept their offer. The problem continued for over seventeen years. I later determined that the 'friends' from the O. S.O. were CIA trainees, who had been sent to our club to spy on us, and to \"learn how to think\". The CIA had secretly used us as a surrogate think-tank. The \"Oil Queen\" of the CIA had given me a copy of T. H. White's Once and Future King as a gift a few months before, and I never knew what was intended, until I recalled the part about where King Arthur just went about his business, despite the embarrassing gossip about court caused by the carryings on of Lance and Guinevere. Well, I considered myself a notch above ol' Art, and the CIA. In reminiscing about the Oil Queen, I am foreve r amazed at the confirmations I got from her, concerning the inventions of Nikola Tesla and his flying saucer. Heir to a large oil fortune with very high connections, she was in the know about energy matters of concern to oil interests; Tesla's invention of the flying saucer, free energy discoveries, and Tom Ogle's 100 miles-per-gallon carburetor, which I w ill tell you more about in this book. IN 1979 I MEET A VIEJO FROM POJOAQUE AT THE FLEA MARKET, AND BUY AWW II GERMAN FLYING SAUCER NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEM FROM AN ALBUQUERQUE SALVAGE DEALER In 1975 I began researching alternative methods of energy generation, based on the premise that inexhaustible energy can be obtained from the environment, because \"...energy cannot be created nor destroyed, but only changed in fo rm...\". Since I conceive of the universe as a never-ending perpetual motion (energy) process—as the rule and not the exception—my goal was to discover ways to trick nature into producing \"free energy\". This involved gathering, focusing, and channeling some part of the infinite perpetual motion of the universe, through whatever work I wanted to do with it. I finally evolved what I call my \"Triax System\". In 1976 or thereabouts, I had resumed my childhood research in nuclear sciences, electricity, and magnetism, which I had begun in 1947, when I was nine years old. By 1978,1 had accumulated a lot of material and knowledge on the work of Nikola Tesla. As a child, my neighbor's father, Elmer Schlosser, a self-taught electronics repair ma n, told me about Tesla, his boyhood inspiration, ALIENS89"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"while growing up in the Cimmarron Territory. He told me the saucer was Tesla's invention. He gave me a lot of materials to use in my experiments with electricity and magnetism. I took the soft iron bars from the windows of the barracks fro m the German P.O.W. camp in Roswell, from which we'd built our new house in 1947, and used the bars in my experiments with magnetism and electricity. Some of the things I discovered seemed to defy the accepted laws of electromagnetism. I had always presumed that Tesla had indeed invented the flying saucer, because of the way the government and Trilateralists had practically drummed his greatness from history. By 1979,1 had several operational Tesla coils, and was hunting materials in the salvage heaps of Los Alamos, Albuquerque, and Santa Fe, to use in a multitude of experiments. It was during this time that many of my new inventions and re-discoveries came about. While browsing through a Santa Fe flea market in 1979,1 met a viejo from Pojoaque, who was trying to sell an old wooden box which he had made in 1937, to carry tools behind the cab of his Model A Ford pickup. On the lid of the box, he had carved, in New Mexico \"folk\" style, a map showing Los Alamos, Pojoaque (with a \"zia\" sign around it), and the unpaved road leading to the interstate, showing \"LA.\" (Los Angeles) one way, and \"N.Y.\" (New York City) the other. The date (\"1937\") was shown, as well as the name of the project (\"p2\") in which he was employed at Los Alamos. The symbol for the project (a triangle with a dot in its center) was also shown. It was a scientific project headed by Wernher Von Braun. The old man said that after the project was \"shut down and moved away\", at the end of 1937, that he was never rehired when the \"new project\" (the Manhattan Project) was begun in 1942. I knew at the time that the triangle with a dot in its center was the \"all-seeing-eye\" of Bel, Ra, or \"God\", that it was a Masonic symbol, and that it appeared on the dollar bill. I was inclined to buy the box at the time, not only as a curiosity, but also because of some haunting reason of which I was not then fully cognizant, but I didn't buy it be cause I was so short on cash at the time. I also thought \"1937\" was a little early for anything scientific at Los Alamos. The Manhattan Project originated in late 1941/early 1942. Our governme nt was an \"ally\" with Germany, until the 1939 invasion of Poland (Surprised?). It would not be until a week later that I would realize my mistake in failing to buy the box, and did not remember the old man's name. Somewhere in Pojoaque or Santa Fe, there may still be an old, hand-ca rved wooden box, which looks like this: "},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"The following week, I regretted having failed to buy the box, when I rea lized what the carving meant. This was revealed when I went to a surp lus dealer's yard in Albuquerque, shortly after a fresh pile of unusual things had been sold to hi m by an employee of Sandia Base. On top of the pile was a navigational device of the type I knew early saucers would have used. The entire pile was not the usual stuff I was able to buy, so I asked Mark King, the owner's son, who was also a friend of mine, what he would have to have for the device. He answered, \"Oh...about seven-fifty\". My heart sank. Seven hundred and fifty dollars was way out of my budget. I asked, \"Seven hundred and fifty dollars?\" Mark answered, \"No...cents, for the whole pile\". I wasted no time picking the stuff up and paying Mark, with a big thanks, a handshake, a smile, and $7.50. When I returned home, I began to examine the device, made in 1943 by Lizt, in Germany, more closely. The label on the device was as follows: Peiltochterkompass KT-p2 GeratNr. 127-178 A-l Anforderz. FI 23374 WerkNr. 10143 Hersteller: gvy There was the \"p2\" again. \"KT-p2\" was the c odename for \"Kreisel Teller\" (German, for \"Gyrating Saucer\") and \"p2\" was, according to Te sla's drawings, either two plates, potentials, or primaries. The 1943 device had a 6-volt motor to drive a geared ring marked in 30-degree partitions, around an inner electromagnetically coupled disk. A selection knob in the center of the face was used to manually turn a pointer to the desired flight-heading. There were fourteen contact points on the bottom, two of which supplied D.C. current to the motor. The motor would rotate the outer geared compass ring until it showed the correct fl ight heading, based on information relayed from \"master\" gyrocompass, oriented to earth's north pole, at which point the motor was automatically switched off The term \"Tochter\" (German, for \"daught er\"), literally meant \"slave\" in this respect, so the term \"Peiltochterkompass\" meant \"Polar-S lave-Compass\". The device was one-half of an inertial or \"celestial\" navigation system. This manually operated device presupposed the \"master\" (gyro) compass....and electromagnetic propulsion, in 1943. I had observed a flying saucer up close in 1953, and my father had been 'held' for at least a quarter of an hour, by another large \"mother ship\"—\"egg-shaped\" and about 200 feet long—as he left Levelland, Texas, on the night of November 2, 1957, which hovered only a few feet above his car, killing his engine and burning out his lights. Both the 1953 and 1957 ships emitted electrical coronal discharges rendering an ordinary comp ass useless. That and the fantastic speeds necessitated an inertial naviga tion system The 1953 ship was obvious ly disoriented, its pilots surprised to find that they were hovering over our town, so their relatively primitive Peiltochterkompass was used to 'dial in' the proper heading, to speed back to their base along the New Mexico-Texas border, between Ft. Bliss and White Sands Missile Range, where Wernher von Braun had brought the post-war German KT-p2 Projekt.

The device I saw on the salvage pile met all the criteria for the device I knew had to exist, and it was made in Germany, by Lizt, on October 1,1943. Since I discussed the device with several people, word soon reached Sandia Base Security that I had it. In their investigation, they went to Mark, who told them he had purchased it from a guy who usually brought stuff released to salvage by Sandia Base. They could not confiscate the device from me, because I had a bill of sale, and Mark had one too. Mark told me later that the security people had told him that the employee from Sandia had stolen the pile of classified salvage and sold it to him. The employee was placed under surveillance, caught doing it again, and sent to jail. Confiscating my Peiltochterkompass would have violated a security regulation prohibiting the confirmation that something is classified. The security personnel also violated that rule in their discussions with Mark. My Peiltochterkompass was a part of a WW II-vintage German electro- propulsive flying saucer, just as I said it was.

While in Ohio, in 1960,1 knew a German girl named Gertrude Thum, whose father, Hitler's personal valet, was released by the Russians la ter that year. Thum was not even mentioned by other historians. On his release by the Russians, the press was not allowed to interview him. He was immediately spirited away by German and American intelligence personnel, who only later, in their presence, allowed Thum to speak to the press from a prepared statement. The Berlin Fuehrerbunker, completely designe d by Hitler, had an unfinished tower opening to the sky at the top, with a landing pad. The tower was directly accessi ble by private staircase from the hallway just outside Hitler's apartment in the lowest level of the bunker. The couple were rescued around sunrise, April 29th, 1945, by flying saucer test pilot Hanna Reitsch and flight expert and navigator Hans Ulrich Rudel, who had made many flights to \"Feuerland\" (\"Fire-land\"). The Russians entered the bunker over two full days later, just before midnight, April 2,1945. While taken to task on the survival of Hitler, other documented information has reached me, concerning the fact that, not only was Reinhard Gehlen, the head of the RSHA VI division of the Gestapo, taken into the CIA, but also his accomp lice, Heinrich Mueller, Chief of the entire Gestapo 1 . One thing's for certain; if Reinhard Heydrich, Architect of the Holocaust, hadn't been assassinated in Bohemia in 1942, the CIA most certainly would have hired him, and naturally, concealed it from us, just as they concealed their hirings of Gehlen and Mueller for over 40 years. This Nazi specter haunts us in the present, with stories from Yugoslavia. When one recounts all the Big History Lies we already know about, \"official history\" begins to look like staged events scripted beforehand, with the complete cooperation of the leaders of all sides, to produce a certain, predictable 'ending'. Of what use is a United Na tions, if it is completely impotent to stop the ethnic and religious squabbling and slaughter in Yugoslavia, with NATO finally becoming the bared fangs of the NWO 'mask'. All NATO can do is destroy a lot of real estate and create mass hysteria which is productive of nothing except more suffering, death, and the destruction of the economy of the poorest European countries, while enriching war industry manufacturers. As stated in a biographical sketch of Nikola Tesla 2 (in pertinent part): \"For a long time the Slav people—who, after the battle of Kosovopjolje, in which the Turks defeated the Servians, retired to the co nfines of the present Montenegro, Dalmatia, Herzegovina and Bosnia, and \"Borderland\" of Austria—knew what it was to deal, as our Western pioneers did, with foes ceaselessly fretti ng against their frontier; and the races of these countries, through their strenous struggle agains t the armies of the Crescent, have developed notable qualities of bravery and sagacity, while maintaining a patriotism and independence unsurpassed in any other nation.\" 1 Gregory Douglas, Gestapo Chief (three vols), R.

A primary contractor in this field, was the Count (\"Graf) Ferdinand von Zeppelin . There were a total of three important craft named the \"Graf Zeppelin\", the LZ-127 (775 feet long, commissioned 1928, hangered at Frankfort), the LZ-130 (completed at Friedrichshafen, test flown 9/14/38, last flight 8/22/39, hangered at Frankfort), and the 1,000 foot long \"Super Zeppelin\", the LZ-131 (work on which was purportedly stopped at outbreak of war [1939-40]). The LZ-127 and LZ-130 were dismantled, and on May 6,1940, their two hangers at Frankfort were ceremoniously blown up on the second anniversary of the Hindenburg disaster 1 . The rather senseless destruction of two large dirigibles and their hangers at Frankfort seemed to have been calculated to convince the world that the Nazi dirigible program—and the \"Super Zeppelin\" as well—were discontinued, dismantled, or destroyed—a big ceremony to cover something important up. What's more, an acquaintance from Frankfort said the ha ngers are still there. Recently, a greengrocer acquaintance related to me how, while he and his daughter were traveling from the Albuquerque airport to their home in Santa Fe one night in the 1980s, they were followed all the way by a 'cigar-shaped' ship which flew not far above their car. They got a good look at the bottom, described as looking like a rusty old iron ship's hull, complete with rivets. There were a line of portholes along the bottom—lik e a dirigible—and he could hear the drone of a diesel engine. This to me brought to mind information I had sought to assemble in 1957, regarding a \"super aircraft carrier\", 1,000 feet long, the co nstruction of which was commenced just before the war and 'abandoned', which was named the Graf Zepp elin. While in Air Force intelligence, I had first heard of the 'super ship' in a book I was read ing about Patton, and was curious about its fate, so I asked my associate, a sergeant who had been a spy in the area of Hamburg at the end of the war. He told me the Graf Zeppelin had a stainless steel hull which was 11 inches thick, and when I asked him what had happened to it, he said it wa s \"sank in the North Sea\" or was 'dismantled'. He then became evasive to my further inquiries (Uh-oh! Still classified !). The existence of a \"Super Zeppelin\" as a supposed \"dirigible\", is documented in Toland's book, and as an \"aircraft carrier\", is documented in a naval history of WWII by Keegan Both versions were 1,000 feet long, were both 'discontinued' \"at the beginning of the war\", were both named \"Graf Zeppelin\", and were both \"super\". A great coincidence in names for supposedly \"different\" type ships. The late model U-boat pressure hulls were \"c igar-shaped\", perfectly round tubes, to which were added the usual outer ballast tanks, conning towers, etc. to complete the subs. With portholes added to their bottoms, the \"naked tubes\" would have been perfect, ready-made hulls for ships for a \"Mars Mission\", such as von Braun had already planned.

The 'rusty old iron ship's hull' seen by my greengrocer friend, was apparently one of the ear ly prototypes, converted from a submarine hull, and later brought to New Mexico with the rest of the German projects, and now hangered at Sandia Base, Manzano Base , White Sands, or some other clandestine site. The stainless-steel-hulled 'super' Graf Zeppeli n LZ-131 \"aircraft carrier\"—carrying flying saucers—could have been a \"flagship\" from whic h Hitler and Doenitz could have directed the stalemate scenario at the war's end. Use of an (\"11-inch-thick\") stainless steel hull could have had two purposes, 1) to eliminate the need for the inner ribs and ballast tanks (the heavy weight of the hull and all internal equipment, including several flying saucers, being sufficient to submerge it in the ocean), and 2) to provide sufficient radiation shielding outside the Van Allen Radiation Belt. The stainless steel could also have avoided the re sistance, hysteresis losses and inductance heating of a steel hull subjected to high frequency, high voltage currents, supplied by large Tesla coils powered by an hermetic helium generator and battery system. Was the LZ-131 powered by helium reactors, just as my mother had heard from our New Mexico friends in 1949? Trading With the Enemy 1 documents how Germany would have obtained helium. We are told that helium is an \"inert gas\", but available scientific information shows that by a simple electric spark discharge, helium will produce 760 kcal./g.-atom 2 . This is the approximate caloric equivalent to 760 loaves of bread, produced from a gram-atom of helium subjected to van de Graaff discharge. Available documents show a globular liquid helium tank (which misinformants call a \"Thule Tachyonator\"), reaction chamber, and an interconnected van de Graaff generator, in a German flying saucer. A van de Graaff would have been an excellent, simple way to supply the required high voltage discharges needed for helium generation of power to run the two large Tesla coils shown in the documents, probably mislabelled by the O.S.I. With the generation of power from helium by electric spark discharge, the use of \"trigatron\" spark gaps takes on a whole new meaning. The spark gaps—fed by helium (falsely described as an 'inert gas' used to 'insulate' the spark gaps)— might have been the fuel for generation of high voltage electricity. I traced the use of trigatrons to 1930s Germany 3 . Was the Graf Zeppelin originally outfitted to function alternately as a battleship, submarine, and Super Zeppelin/cigar-shaped mother ship/aircraft carrier/interplanetary space ship? According to Rudolf Lusar 4 , she was scuttled outside Stettin, salvaged by the Russians, and sank on the way to Leningrad. The \"official\" story was that Hitler purportedly scrapped the huge Graf Zeppelin super carrier before it was completed, to embark on some \"very ambitious\" U-boat constructions and development. The same or remarkably similar ship to the Graf Zeppelin was 1 Charles Higham, Trading With the Enemy, Dell Publishing Co., New York (1983). 2 Van Nostrand Reinhold Co., Van Nostrand's En cyclopedia of Science, 5th Ed.

In 1945, as the Russians closed in on the Berlin Bunker, flying saucer test pilot Hanna Reitsch and Colonel Hans Ulrich Rudel, who had made ma ny flights to \"Feuerland\" (Tierra del Fuego, on the southern tip of South America), piloted the flying saucer carrying Eva and Adolf Hitler to the safety of the Graf Zeppelin, from which to direct the battle during the stalemate. There, from the secret Nazi supership, Hitler made his final demands on the Allies as a field commander, and exacted his nuclear blackmail on America 3 . After the stalemate, the Hitlers returned to Germany under secret allied protectioa Today, German fl ying saucer bases, such as the huge underground base built in Greenland, are probably maintained under joint Trilateral/ex-Nazi control. The Deutsche Antarktische Expedition (1938-39) laid out Germany's claim to part of Antarctica, which claim has been undisturbed si nce the war. In the last coded messages from Martin Bormann, references to \"Tierra del Fue go\" (A.K.A., \"Feuerland\") were made, as the reins of power were transferred to Reichschancellor Admiral Doenitz, and his twenty-four German U-Boats surrounded the United States, armed with I.C.B.M.s (A-9s), carrying neutron bomb warheads, and with celestial guidance systems. From this position of strength, Doenitz negotiated with the Allies, during a stalemate. The Russians were overrunning German y, but Germany had its nuclear missiles trained on the heart of America. If Germany fired the missiles, the Russians would take all of Germany, and all would be lost for the Germans, who could have bombed America, yet would have had no home to return to. Under the circumstances, only America could save only half of Germany, and so a deal was cut. Certain c onditions were stipulated, and Doenitz was required to \"scuttle all U-boats with all hands on board\", as a part of the amnesty agreement. Certain people were guaranteed amnesty, including Eva an d Adolf Hitler, who were secretly provided with a cozy and secure home in Kassel Germany, for th e rest of their lives, under the protection of the N.A.T.O. allies 4 . The story that Admiral Karl Doenitz assumed pow er after \"Hitler's suic ide\" was untrue, since even available documents show that full power wa s transferred to Doenitz as soon as the \"opera\" at the Fuehrerbunker began, designe d to buy time while Doenitz put Hitler's ultimate plan for the stalemate into place. If the commonly accepted st ory were true, Doenitz would have assumed power on April 30, 1945, with the \"unconditional surrender\" (signed by generals Jodl and Friedeburg at Ike's headquarters) on May 7,1945. Doenitz was not taken into custody until May 23, 1945. His headquarters was at Eutin in Holstein, within 50 miles of Hamburg. In April, they had \"120 vessels [of the new \"electro-U-boat\" type] ready for combat\", with only one of them \"going into combat\". That was double talk. No combat was necessary, because of the stalemate. 1 Frank Edwards, Flying Saucer s: Serious Business, Bantam, New York (1966), p. 12. 2 Paul R.

As soon as power was transferred to Doenitz and a 'new hierarchy' installed, Albert Speer was heard to exclaim, \"W e now have an operatic government\" 1 , a statement which confirmed its purp ose during the coming stalemate. Hitler's Alpine Redoubt had significance only to the extent that last-minute technical work was being performed there, relative to the special saucer operations of General Otto Skorzeny, and nuclear weapons used in the missiles. The failure to expedite several secret emergency plans for defense of various areas of the Reich, all followed the direction of the still higher plan, being executed under the cover of the other 'last ditch' plans of which the Allies were advised. The Germans intentionally collapsed the western front on cue, to suck the Allies into Germany, so the firestorm bombings would stop, and so we could not nuke them. In 1967, the Hitlers were invited by presid ent Lyndon Johnson, to be his guests, during Hemisfair, the world's fair in San Antonio, Texas. The main tower of the Hemisfair, was designed by an architect who had been a high-ranking member of the S.S. As I sold paintings with a friend of mine in the La Villita area, in the seating opposite the Arneson River Theatre, along the San Antonio River, Adolf and Eva Hitler came by us, as I spotted them the moment they came into view. I had just been talking to a German \"engin eer\"—whom I realized was a security agent, the moment I spotted the Hitlers—and Hitler took an in terest in a particular painting of the Moritz Von Schwindt variety. When he saw that I r ecognized him, he and Eva were quickly whisked away by their security agents. My friend Bob, also a former Air Force Intelligence personnel, who sat next to me, agreed that what we saw was wh at we saw. This event was followed up by other security agents, who came by and talked to us, to debrief us. We played it cool. What else could we do? If we had said anything about it, who would ha ve believed us? I have been taken to task for this sighting, but I'm sorry. There were just too many indicators to verify it.

Our military didn't obtain such systems until twenty years later, Patton was sent to Peenemunde, on the Baltic, to pick up the files, and to make sure the flying saucer and rocket projects were cleaned out before the Russians go t there, and that everything valuable was destroyed Patton was probably assassinated, as several biographers suggested, by Army Intelligence. This was probably because of something to do with the flying saucers and Operation Paperclip. Though posthumously accused of wanting to be too soft on the Germans after the 1 William R.

As for the neutron bomb, when prisoners from Rommel's Afrika Korps were brought to Roswell, New Mexico, they carried some rather strange post cards, apparently printed by Rommel's field lithographers, showing New York City being destroyed by a mushroom cloud. The camp commandant, Dave Dunn, who later beca me an engineer with Union Oil Company of California in their Midland, Texas Office, and who prepared the U.S.G.S. for President John F. Kennedy in 1962, thought these were humorous, and showed me one he had saved as a souvenir. The fact was, however, that Ro mmel's main mission in the Libyan desert, was testing the neutron bomb. The post cards carried by his troops were a 'morale builder', which superimposed the photolithograph of the mushroom cloud of the bomb they had actually te sted and photographed, over a photolithograph of New York City, in a composite. The claims by the Manhattan Project members, that they built the first ATOM bomb—from German plans—was true. After all, Einstein had brought the stolen plans to us with the firm belief that we would use the A-bomb on Germany. Since the Allies had already succeeded in obtaining the German plans for the A-bomb, Werner Heisenberg merely sidestepped the A-bo mb, and built the N-bomb. The question to me was not \"if', but \"how\" (did the Germans make their neutron bomb)? Dr. Sam Cohen, inventor of the American neut ron bomb, traces the production and sale of a mysterious substance called \"red mercury\" to Russia 1 . Red mercury is a mercury antimony oxide, specially prepared by irradiation and pressured in to a gel to increase its density to create the necessary preconditions for a neutron explosion. A small quantity of it can then be used as a nuclear trigger/igniter, to detonate a small amount of heavy hydrogen, producing the deadly neutrons for a 'clean bomb'. In February, 1992, Russian president Boris Yeltsin signed Directive No. 75-RPS, authorizing Promekologia, a Russ ian company headed by Yeltsin's ecological advisor, to \"manufacture, purchase, store, transport, deliver, and sell for rubles and foreign currency\" 'red mercury', in amounts up to ten tons per year. The order was rescinded a year later because of criticism within Russia of export of such a \"valuable ra w material\". In a spring, 1994 documentary on Britain's Channel Four (\"British PBS\"), a Russian nuclear chemist confirmed he had worked with red mercury since 1965, that it is currently produced in a factory in the central Russian town of Ekaterinburg, and that fusion weapons have been made in Russia from it. Cohen believes red mercury represents one of the greatest threats for potential terrorists to produce \"baseball bombs\" from it. He may be right. On April 4, 1944, Nazi submarine U-859 was sunk near Penang (location of one of three Nazi far eastern U-boat bases), by the British submarine Trenachant. The Nazi sub was carrying 1 Dr. Sam Cohen, America Online: DJIBO (3/1/95). ALIENS99"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"33 tons of mercury to Japan 1 . Perhaps the Japanese were to process the mercury, or use it in their own neutron bombs. As for how the Soviets could have ended up with the red mercury technology, a persistent rumor 2 has it that a U-boat rendezvoused with a Soviet surface vessel shortly after the surrender in the South Atlantic, at Mar del Plata, Argentina, and bartered Nazi neutron bomb technology for the release of German P.O.W.s in Russia. If the Germans indeed tested a neutron bomb in North Africa, I would bet that it was produced with red mercury, since the Russians employed German metallurgists and nuclear chemists in their nuclear program, and it was they who produced Germany's WWII supply of plutonium, purer than any ever produced, so pure that it must be diluted before use, even today. Ironically, in 1946, my father bought the buildings comprising the Roswell P.O.W. camp, and moved them to Kermit, because he couldn't get building material s anywhere else. The prisoners had done a beautiful job of converting one of their barracks into an Alpine \"great hall\", and used egg-tempera to paint about 100 windows to look like stained glass, with Alpine scenes, and coats of arms. They even built a sauna. Vandals eventu ally smashed the windows where they were being stored. Did the prisoners carry out and witn ess a neutron bomb test in North Africa? What happened at Los Alamos and Mescalero, New Mexico in the late 1930s, involved Wernher von Braun, project lead er at Hitler's Vergeltungswaff en development and production center at Peenemunde—which included the fl ying saucer project commenced in New Mexico. Tesla had created a remarkable turbine, what we now know as the alternator, and the T.M.T., all for use on his flying saucer. He tried in vain to interest the government in his turbine and several other potentially great defense inventions, but th e government showed little confidence in Tesla's abilities, and considered them too far flung to work or to be of value. In Jan., 1914, just prior to the entry of America into WW I, after the government showed no interest in the turbine, Tesla acquired a $5,000.00 loan from J. P. Morgan, Jr., so he could finish and ship a turbine to the German Ministry of Marine, High Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz. 3 Since he had already unsuccessfully offered the turbine to the U. S. gover nment, he felt it no question of loyalty. It is my belief that around 20 years later, after unsuccessfully offering his flying saucer invention to the U. S. government, he agreed to collaborate with the Germans in the p2 project at Los Alamos. The person who was most instrumental in inducing Tesla to work with the Germans in the \"p2\" Los Alamos project, aside from Uncle Sam, was a close personal frie nd of Tesla's, George Sylvester Viereck, who was also a close personal friend of Adolf Hitler, and was convicted in 1942 for failure to register with the U. S. Department of State as a Nazi agent. 4 Viereck took advantage of Tesla's loneliness, shoddy treatment and lack of respect from the U. S. Government, and Tesla's need to see his project through before the end of bis life. He spent considerable time and patience in cultivating Tesla's trust, thus allowing the Nazis to end up with his technology, with the complicity of the government, through the American foundations who were involved 1 Haarmann, D.

Let's take a closer look at this situation. THE ROCKET RACKET: Wernher von Braun, Willy Ley, Dr. Robert Goddard, And The Kreisel Teller-p2, In New Mexico and Peenemunde The facts in this section bring forth some ve ry interesting questions which were missed by Charles Higham, in his Trading with the Enemy. Beginning around March 26, 1926, when Dr. Robert Goddard (1882-1945), professor of physics at Clarke University in Massachusetts, launched the first liquid-fueled rocket, at Auburn. In Germany, Willy Ley had read Hermann Oberth's book on space travel th at year, then wrote his own fi rst book, Trip into Space. He communicated with Oberth, then formed the Verein fur Raumschiffahrt (\"Union for Space Travel\"). In 1927, Ley introduced Wernher von Braun to the Union, and was von Braun's first tutor in rocket research. In 1927, the Graf Zeppelin LZ-127 was commissioned. It was a 775 foot long dirigible. From 1928 to 1933, Ley was vice president of the Union. Goddard had fired the first instrumented rocket in America, in 1930. That year, von Braun assisted Oberth in early liquid fuel rocket research. In fall, 1930, von Braun joined the Union, which established a launching field in an abandoned proving ground at Ploetensee, outside Berlin (cost= $.25/year). Experiments were conducted with 13-lb. thrust rockets. ALIENS 101"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"In 1931, Ley provided the basic ideas for a liquid fueled rocket which was fired to an altitude of one mile. In 1932, von Braun acquired his B.S. de gree, having studied at the Technical Institute in Berlin, and in Zurich, Switzerland. He complete d 85 rocket tests that ye ar, with rockets which reached an altitude of a mile in free flight. In fall, 1932, the entire rocket program was transferred to Wehrmacht ordnance, with the 20-year-old von Braun appointed to head an experiment station at Kummersdorf. In 1933, nose-mounted gyrostabilizers were tested Hitler ca me to power that year, and the Gestapo seized all papers of the Union and the research center. In June, 1934, von Braun was granted his Ph.D. in physics by the University of Berlin. That year, a center-mounted gyrostabilizer was tested, making a 2,000 meter (c. 6,000 ft.) flight. In 1935, near Mescalero, New Mexico (Eden Valley), Goddard's flights exceeded 700 mph., and altitudes of 7,500 feet, with financial support from the Smithsonian Institution and the Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Foundation. This at tracted the attention of Ley and von Braun. On February 21,1935, on invitation from Goddard and the American Rocket Society (the Smithsonian), Ley arrived in New York City, th ence traveled to New Me xico to work with Goddard. In 1936, Hitler took greater interest, and poured 20 million marks into his Peenemunde center, commissioning von Braun and his group to \"produce a field weapon capable of carrying a large warhead over a range much beyond that of artillery\". Through Goddard, Ley arranged an invitation for von Braun from the American Rocket Society, for his visit to New Mexico, where in 1936-37, he collaborated with Goddard at Mescalero and the Eden Valley firing range, while running a secret Illuminati \"p2\" flying saucer project at Los Alamos. During that same time, he was still Hitler's project director at Peenemunde, in absentia. Ley must have worked on the p2 project also, because of his great knowledge of electrical science, but took out American citizenship papers in 1937, the year von Braun was appointed Obersturmbannfuehrer in the S.S. In 1938, von Braun returned to Peenemunde with \"p2\", and an increased knowledge of higher performance liquid fueled rockets acquired from Goddard, courtesy of the Smithsonian and th e Guggenheims, and began developing the V-2 (Vergeltungswaffen No. 2 [\"revenge weapon No. 2\"), with a range of about 11 miles. The Nazis lost a great scientist when Ley decided to remain in America. On May 6, 1940, two large dirigible hangers at Frankfort were ceremoniously destroyed. They had housed the Graf Zeppelins LZ-127 and LZ-128. The \"Super-Zeppelin\" LZ-131 (1,000 feet long) was supposedly also abandoned A \"shi p\"—supposedly a \"super aircraft carrier\", also named the Graf Zeppelin, also 1000 feet long—was also supposedly abandoned in 1940, and Hitler's interest in rockets dwindled (since th e German flying saucer project, \"KT-p2\" was then under way?). The rocket program apparently had to be resumed, to buy more time for the KT-p2 program. Meanwhile in America, Ley became a me mber of the scientific department for PM newspaper in May, 1941, and on X-mas, 1941, married Russian-bom ballerina Olga Feldman. Ley had escaped Naziism in America In 1941-42, the V-2 became 20 times larger, with a c. 190 mile range, and almost a ton payload. Before the war's end, von Braun's rocket s were capable of 20-ton payloads and a 3,000 mile range (capable of hitting New York and ot her American cities). Von Braun fired over 3,600 V-2s into England and Antwerp. Nice guy. Beginning in 1944 (to 1948), Ley was appointed director of engineering at Burke Aircraft Corporation, Atlanta, Ga., later made part of Washington Institute of Technology, College Park, ALIENS 102"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Maryland, just outside Washington, D.C., adjacent to the Goddard Space Flight Center. I surmise that, with his knowledge of \"p2\" and microwaves , Ley formed the matrix of America's earliest government-related flying saucer project, within this corporation, followed by its relocation to the environs of Washington, D.C., which indicated a very high security priority. In March, 1945, with Russian troops within 100 miles of Peenemunde, von Braun and about 400 top colleagues left for the Bavarian redo ubt—code-named the Se rail—occupying a resort hotel. They were found by Operation Paperclip, and von Braun immediately signed a contract with the U.S. Army. In Sept., 1945, von Braun and 116 of his rocket colleagues were flown to Ft. Bliss, where von Braun was appointed as Technical Di rector, U.S. Army Or dnance Guided Missile Center. By May, 1946, V-2 testing was resumed at White Sands Proving Grounds. In the obituary of German missile expert Dr. Ernst A. Steinhoff, in Alamorgordo (c. 1991), it was stated that during the war he was in charge of flight dynamics, guidance, control and telemetry of the German V-2s, and participated in the first launch of a missile from a submarine under the Lafferenz Project (in preparation for the missiles carried by the advanced \"Electro-U-boats\" in the stalemate of 1945). In 1947, Willy Ley wrote about \"submarine rockets\" used by the Germans during the war. Along with Germany's Dr. Hein z Fisher, Ley was one of the world's greatest experts on radar. Microwaves (\"rapidly varying electrostatic forces) are directly related to gravity and flying saucer propulsion, according to Tesla's Dynamic Theory of Gravity. In Aug., 1949, von Braun was made an honorary member of the British Interplanetary Society, through his friend, Arthur C. Clarke. During the war, he was awarded the Knights Cross and title of Research Professor (\"Herr Doktor Prof essor\") at Peenemunde by Hitler, was made an honorary member of the Gesellschaft fur Weltraumforschung, Stuttgart, and of the Nordwestdeutsche Gesellschaft fur Weltraumforschung, Friedrichstadt. In 1950, the U.S. Army Guided Missile Center was moved from Ft. Bliss to Redstone Arsenal, Huntsville, Alabama, where von Braun was transferred as technical director. In September of 1951, von Braun's paper on an 869-day Mars mission was read to the Second International Congress of Astronautics, London (t he \"Super Zeppelin\" probably already made the trip in much faster time, beginning in 1945). On Oct. 12,1951, an 'unmanned' two-stage rocket (probably a reworked German two-staged A-9) reached a 250 mile altitude from White Sands. Showing his Illuminist sympathies, von Braun once said \"...As long as national sovereignty exists, our only hope is to raise everybody's standard of ethics.\" His rocket programs were nothing more than a cover for the IllumiNazi flyi ng saucer technology and ether physics. I MEET TORQUEMADA AND THE MEDELLIN CARTEL As mentioned in Chapter I, the government of New Mexico is fascist, especially the judiciary. In Nazi Germany, the judiciary was among the last institutions to succumb to fascism. In New Mexico, it leads the way, in terms of \"econom ic fascism\". This is true perhaps because, in striking first to protect what it deems to be the \"public interest\", it is the lackey of the military-industrial complex, the power of which is felt through the many secret agencies connected to it in New Mexico. The judiciary functions as a guardian of the golden pipeline which channels the payola (taxpayers' money) into the state, and as such, are puppets dancing on the strings of the CIA. ALIENS 103"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"The state used judicial tactics to harass me, which delayed this expose, beginning in early 1975, just after I turned down the position of 9th Regional Director for the CIA. Ever since then, behind-the-scenes agitation of, and manipulati on by abusive, incessant litigation prevailed Toward the end of this overt judicial harrassment, as I was gathering evidence in the County Clerk's Office, I spotted a young man observing me from nearby, and looked him in the eye. Realizing that I knew he was a fed, he then said, \"You know, of all the people we've done this to, you're the only one who hasn't broken..\" That was at the end of 1991, just prior to Bush's departure from office. Harassment immediately slac kened, perhaps in apprehension of a backfire. I am leaving a lot of NAMES out of this book. Many CIA field agents are naively unaware of the fact that the rats they serve are unworthy, and that their work will ultimately serve the Trilateral Commission and betray their own people. It's time to wake up and smell the coffee, or perhaps, the cocaine, smuggled by the new \"Untouchables\", the CIA. The history of cocaine, in the political sense, is tied to fascism. It was the drug of choice of Hermann Goering and many other fascists. In reference to what I call \"contemporary New Mexico fascism\", one looks for several things. Cocaine is only one means for controlling high-placed users, such as judges, lawyers, and public officials. For example, one Santa Fe judge is an ex-pornographer who is strung out on cocaine. This gives the CIA and cartels two means of extorting what they want, in addition to protection of their supplying of the drug. The 'customer' needs the drug, and he doesn't want to be exposed as a child pornographer, so he is in a double bind. This is also why the CIA prefers corruption at the top. They copied their methods from the mob. \"We'll just keep this video tape on file, a nd no one will see it so long as you do like we say. In addition, we'll pay you every time you render a decision like we want\" (or vote a particular way, if a senator or congressman). To raise money for CIA black operations in Central America, the Medellin Cocaine Cartel was organized by Klaus Barbie—the Nazi war cr iminal closely connected to Dr. Mengele, the \"Angel of Death\". Both Barbie and Mengele were brought to America under Operation Paperclip, but were provided new identities and shipped off to South America by the U.S. Army C.I.C., because they were too hot to handle here. Others, even though \"hot\", often shown by history books to be dead, got new \"Amerikan\" names, and were employed in America. Many of the kingpins of the cartel are the offspring of S.S. officers who married South American women, especially Colombian women. Jack Anderson, the columnist, uncovered some of these things a few years ago. Because of the Spanish histor y, as well as the inherent politically corrupt fascist government, New Mexico, like the \"Little Havana\" of Florida, is especially suited as the \"cocaine capitol\" Banana Republic of the central U.S. The governme nt and law enforcement here \"belong\" to the cartel. Political influence can also be bought more cheaply here because the politicians of New Mexico are seedier, cheaper, smaller-time crooks. No matter what turn th e politics takes, there seems to be no difference, as there has been no significant change in CIA drug smuggling in the area. A governor is without power to stop it, and would be risking his life to try. There is a considerable amount of real estate and bank money-laundering in New Mexico, on behalf of the fascist drug marketeers, with a comp liant judiciary to protect them Even the I.R.S. cooperates with the cartel, \"so long as its particip ants declare the income and pay the taxes due\". Their attitude is that of the Federal Reserve Bank. They only want their piece of the action. They had rather collect the taxes, than to roll the di ce on prosecution for evasion. The judiciary merely views the money-laundering and related big-time drug payola, in much the same way that it does ALIENS 104"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"the secret government payola, all as part of an economic boon to New Mexico, and therefore within its duty to protect as a matter of \"public policy\". Northern New Mexico has become one of the primary deal-making and distribution points for CIA-connected cocaine traffic in central North America. This makes New Mexico's small-time judiciary feel more big-time, and they are flatte red by it. As part of the world-wide cocaine scenario, the involvement of New Mexicans themselves, is rather menial by comparison, in the capacities of quasi-lackies, sort of like \"spear bearer s\" in an opera. It is my belief that the cartels and CIA even use flying saucers to make many of the drug shipments and deliveries, because flying saucers were among the first of the \"stealth \" aircraft used by the secret government. There are connections between the real estate developmen ts here, former S.S. officers such as Colonel Otto Skorzeny (who died in 1975 in Barcelona, Spain), the Trilateralists, the Krupps (who gave us Hitler), and even Fidel Castro, of Cuba. For example, one of my former tenants and her former Colombian doctor husband (the offspring of a Nazi S.S. officer and a Colombian woman), were involved in receiving shipments of cocaine in Encino, New Mexico, where Cuban Air Force planes, piloted by uniformed officers, delivered cargo plane loads of Colombian cocaine and marijuana. They were never caught or stopped, and obviously had the secret blessings of st ate and federal officials. The tenant was later shown in the papers, hugging Fidel Castro, who had muscled into the (CIA) drug traffic, by threatening to shoot down dope- carrying planes, unless the cartel cut him in for a 'piece of the action'. This was arranged through fugitive financ ier, Robert Vesco, a Nixon and Bush pal. Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega was extradited and jailed by the U.S. in Georgia, because of his little stunt—forming an alliance with Castro, who cut the two in for a bigger piece of the action by threatening to shoot down the Colombian planes. This CIA-connected dope crowd worked with a former neighbor, a former member of the Weather Underground and the Comm unist Party (according to info rmation my former attorney said the F.B.I gave him), who handled at least fifteen tons of Colombian marijuana per year, picked up in approximately 100-kilo shipments near my house, in the limos driven by members of the Chicago mob. Though arrested once, she beat the rap under the \"adult prosecution diversion program\" which she was legally ineligible for, while all her criminal records were erased, after she put up a total of $25,000.00 in bribes. This was mere pennies to the dealer, since, at a very conservative $50.00 per oz., there was easily $24 million per year in marijuana alone being exchanged, within 100 feet of my back door, and probably over $100 million by the time it became more 'clandestine', due to the publicity of the bust, which was barely noticed in the papers. Add to this the probable take in cocaine, the total was probably twice that. I suppose all those money-making activities by my Weather Underground neighbor were \"...for ze revolution...\". Sadly, the only 'revolution' being fina nced, was one in which the New World Order of John D. Rockefeller, Adolf Hitler, and George Bush et. al, was protracted through black operations of the CIA in Central America and elsewhere, funded by Klaus Barbie's South American cocaine cartel, spawned by the CIA's \"Operation Paperclip\", which is how Bush and the CIA motivated my neighbors, made me suffer, and suppressed energy and flying saucer secrets. The judicial harassment which began in 1975, became particularly obvious (to me) in 1980, when the D.A.'s office persisted in prosecuting me on a fraudulent and abusive fish and game charge, based on tampered evidence, similar to a prior, 1975 incident created by the ALIENS 105"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Communist/dope-dealing plea-bargainer, who maliciously had me arrested on trumped-up assault charges, because her Chicago Mafia customers were complaining about my neighborhood presence. They didn't like me driving my vehicles past their windows in the wee hours of the morning, while they were trying to get a good night's sleep, prior to their pre-dawn departures back to Chicago, in the Mob's Cadillac limos loaded to the springs with dope. This was the obvious response of state and federal officers toward an innocent neighborhood bystander, who had, by his increased awareness and knowledge , threatened the Golden Pipe line of funds for CIA black operations in Central America. A dead \"endangered specie\" bird was planted in the refrigerator in one of my apartments, wrapped in aluminum foil, as tenants vacated , and I was charged with \"possession\". This malicious prosecution coincided with the $50,000.00 grant from the feds to the Santa Fe D.A's office, to investigate cattle mutilations, to be conducted by ex-F.B.I. agent Kenneth Rommel. Meanwhile, my key defense witness, former tenant Bill Englert, was killed when the single-engine aircraft he was piloting plowed into the ground in Alaska, during his last flight to Ankorage, the day before his planned return to Santa Fe to test ify. After obtaining his pilot license, Bill worked as a fish-spotter for Alaskan fishing fleets near An korage. I speculated that his plane had been sabotaged prior to his last takeoff, just to prevent his testimony, since there were those present with him in Alaska, who worked with my New Mexico neighbor in the smuggling operations. In fact, they formed a direct extension of the Colombia-to-Alaska drug conduit. Fish and Game fuzz John Miles, who conducted the search and seizure illegally and without a warrant, and issued the abusive subpoena illegally, and physically assaulte d me on my own property, is now head of the agency. The malicious prosecution was coordinated with the government's investigation of itself in the cattle mutilations, smuggling dope to fund its black operations, and murder of anyone who got in the way, in the Big Lie program, designed to conceal these dark deeds along with flying saucer propulsion secrets, along with activities connected to a secret program involved with the cattle mutilations. The mutilations program collects a nd analyzes 'specific biological tissue' from mammals—cattle—which are similar enough to humans to yield reliable results in tests of \"stealth\" particle beam weapons under development, intended for use on humans. This monitoring of the effects of ionizing radiation on cattle, is 'pseudo-justified' to NSA oversight committees, on 'environmental grounds', since the techniques for studying the effects of radiation—whether produced by the high-voltage electrical discharges emitted by saucers, or defense-related weapons under \"national secu rity purposes\"—are essentially the same. The weapons appear to be for \"population control\", judging from the degree of secrecy surrounding the removal of tissue from the cattle. (See Chap. TV [\"Sightings\"] for more on this subject). The use of other people's animals without their permission helps to conceal the research, since the presence of such large animals at government facilities would be obvious. Since the weapons are designed for use on humans in thei r natural environment, without their knowledge, use of them on cattle, as the most available mammals around, produces more realistic results. A 'spinof' benefit of the perennial \"tests\", is to justif y the continued veil of secrecy, since, so long as there is \"on-going\" research i nvolving the saucers, the secrec y conceals them and everything connected to them. Though the government continue s to use the national security veil to deny public access to saucer technology, the ultimate purpose is the private, economic security of ALIENS 106"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"IllumiNazi corporations. One fascist hand washes the other, as we are controlled and experimented on like lab animals, and the sham continues. Back in 1966, during my second semester of law school at U.T., I had discussed saucer propulsion with another law student during a coffee break between classes, within earshot of a student whom I knew to be employed by the CIA. Immediately afterward, in a class of the eminent constitutional law professor, Charles Allen Wright, the CIA/student screamed out, \"...What should the penalty be for a law student who disclosed 'national security secrets' in the hallways?\", gesturing toward me. Wright screamed, \"He didn't disclose national security secrets!\" Around two days later, as I drove south down Red River Street at its intersection with 6th Street, out of the corner of my eye to my left, I spotted a discolored '55 Ford being driven by two Air Force men, parked at the curb near the light. As I entered the intersection, they floor-boarded the Ford, and accelerated directly toward my left door. In a quick reflex, I applied brakes and swerved to my right, just in time to deflect their blow. Both my Chevy station wagon and the Ford were totaled. The Ford had no license plate, and the two men, whose uniforms bore no insignia or other markings, were ticketed for running a red light and causing the collision, and nothing else, although circumstances indicate that they should have been arrested on the spot. The following day, I discovered that the two airmen were \"shipped out' from Bergstrom Air Base, and the Base Commandant's office refused to give me their names or their \"newly assigned base\". There was no doubt in my mind that they were Air Force \"hitters\" from the O.S.I. This incident was easy to connect to Air Force spo oks, since the men lacked identities, ranks, and addresses, their car was equally anonymous, and th e base Advocates office concealed their identies and whereabouts. I could detail a half dozen more such incidents, all of which had similar Kafkaesque qualities which could only be created by a secret police state. This CIA harrassment occurred after they told President Kennedy that I worked for them, and prior to to their actual attempts to recruit me. Some of it was meddling in my life by George Bush, prior to his CIA directorship. Most of the harrassment and malicious prosecution in New Mexico was ostensibly property related. Every property transaction I was involved in since 1970, was intentionally engineered at the outset by the CIA, or screwed up by them They initially suckered me into coming to Santa Fe in the first place. In 1970, they offered me a seven- acre tract at the junction of Cerrillos Road and Rodeo Road, for a mere $4300.00, which is now wort h millions, and presently includes a business owned by my CIA girlfriend. In 1973, they transferred a beautiful ten-acre parcel on Barrancas Drive to me, filed the deed, and even had it asse ssed to me. That property is worth at least a million. The transaction was signed by an ex-CIA employee (now a lawyer/banker), a former New Mexico Governor connected to the CIA, and another well-known (also ex-CIA) lawyer. It took me at least four trips to the county assessor's and clerk's offices to convince them the property was not mine. These attempts to give me property by the C IA, were related to attempts to \"recruit\" me, by indebting me to them, in anticipation of future employment which they intended to provide me, whether I liked it or not. D.A.s, police, and judges are easily controlled by the N.S.A., and can be made to do anything under the guise of \"national security\". Even more extreme, I knew that at least two D.A.S, (one in Texas) were employees of the CIA, because one was involved in attempting to recruit me directly, and the other I won't say how I know. One judge inadvertently disclosed to me that the N.S.A. was influencing the case before him, in which I was involved, in his ruminations from the bench, ALIENS 107"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"mumbling that I was supposed to be \"...some sort of 'rocket scientist' or something...\", which the government wished to control. That was because the particular orders given to him came from security people connected ostensibly to rocketry, but were actually concerned about flying saucers. That judge was a close personal friend to a man I re fer to as the \"Friend\", about whom I will say more later. We don't control these people. They operate on their own, inside our government, representing the Trilateralists, not us. For around ten years, I was grilled by northern New Mexico's \"Torquemada\", (a Santa Fe judge). There, sitting in judgment of me, was a psychologically tormented, insecure \"momma's boy\" from Espanola—an 'ex-pornographer' who was addicted to cocaine—who for the sake of his co-addict/sadist legal colleagues, took every opportunity to pretend to impeach my credibility, or make underhanded swipes at my character, which were really none of his business. When I first moved to New Mexico, I was a sculptor and a painter. I had already undergone a horrible incident at the University of Texas, in stigated by Jesuit-controlled agents of Dr. John (\"Long John\") Silber, which eventually resulted in his being fired by Frank Erwin, President of the Board of Regents, for FRAUD AND CONSPIRACY, a nd the revocation of the PhD. of LB.J.'s Undersecretary of Health, Education and Welfare, Dr. Billy McCrocklin, for plagiarizing his doctoral thesis from a 1920s top secret document on the Garde d'Haiti called \"The Hart Report\". These were not retributions by me, but the result of anger by others over the things being done to me, which tripped certain levers leading to the undoing of an evil perpetrator, taking a few others with him. Some of you may have heard of Dr. John (\"Long John\") Silber, the Dr. Strangelove-type president of Jesuit-run Boston College, who ran for governor of Massachusetts and lost in 1993. He is a rigid, dyed-in-the wool cl assicist/fascist, with a potential to create great mischief. He left the University of Texas after I uncovered his c onspiracy, because he sent a cabal of his \"hatchet-women\" after me. He dragged some of them on up to Boston with him, because they were being run out of Texas too. The incident was similar to one involving John Henry Faulk, with the exception that there probably never will be any attempt to redress what happened to me. What brought the harrassment temporarily to an end, was the blowing of the cover of several CIA operations on the University of Texas campus, which resulted from some of those angered and set into motion over what was happening to me. Some times you never realize who your friends are until the chips are down. I once mentioned to a CIA man whom I respected, that it appeared that the agency could be harrassing someone at the same time another group from the agency was trying to do them a favor, or gain their cooperation. He explained it to me like this: Every organization has its right wing and its left wing, each of which does not seem to know what the other is doing. Though I graduated with what my friend Henry sa id was the highest grade-point average of any fine arts graduate student in the history of th e University of Texas, that incident had dragged me through the mud as it was designed to do, and had taken a lot out of me already. The seventeen years of New Mexico judicial harassment just about stamped out all of the art in me. An artist cannot work under conditions of \"judicial war psychosis\". There are two horrible aspects involved here, which are: (1) The governme nt's policy of secretly violating freedom of speech and press; and (2) clandestinely carryi ng out this policy throu gh obedient government yeggs and dupes, each motivated at his or her own level (and who often don't even know who is ALIENS 108"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"calling the shots).

After all the abusive litigation, I concluded that so-called \"justice\" and \"freedom\" in America are terms used on the naive and ignorant, to give them the false impression that they are the fortunate recipients of \"rights\", which in reality exist only for so long as their individual interests don't conflict with those of the Trilateral Commission. I now realize what a wealthy young man was trying to tell me in 1968, when he said \"...property is just a trap\". I thought he was some kind of Communist or something, who didn't believe in property rights. I didn't own any real estate then, but thought I'd like to have some. I now realize that what he meant was that a person who owns property can be controlled by threats against the ownership of that property by the state, or indirectly through others encouraged by the state. He helped organized the Washington Monument demonstrations in the late '60s, to bring the Viet Nam War to an end. Though a multi-millionaire, he refused to own property. The F.B.I. probably didn't even know who he was. The last six years of horrible controversy which diminished in 1992, involved motivating some of my thug neighbors to sue me, as others continued to abuse me while the litigation progressed in court. As I struggled in vain to hold my family together amidst the stress of litigation and social ostracism created by the criminals behind it and in the courts, they moved in for the kill and destroyed my family. Causing my loved ones to suffer is a \"blood crime\", if you get my meaning, and it won't go unpunished.

I MEET A MEMBER OF THE TRILATERAL COMMISSION'S INTERNATIONAL GEODETIC SURVEY TEAM This region is quite a crossroad of America, including many Trilateral Commission connections. A friend of mine was one of the surv eyors for the International Geodetic Survey, in the 1950s, during the Korean War. The survey was international, which meant that the supposedly civilian American scientific crew s, with American military escorts, were allowed into China, the Soviet Union, etc., even during the war. My frien d was a surveyor in the American military, as was the entire survey crew he worked with. The scientif ic crew was civilian. However, according to my friend, they switched clothing, so that the military survey crew looked like civilians, and vice-versa. The civilian-dressed (military) survey crew, would determine the location of each of the points, to be marked by the I.G.S. brasscaps, and were inst ructed to remove themselves from the area, after which the (military-dressed) civilian crew wo uld then come to place the brass-caps. One day, after locating a point, my friend left the area, then discovered that he had forgotten some of his equipment, and went back to get it. At that time, he came upon the other crew, while they were supposedly in the process of setting th e I.G.S. brass-cap. This came as a surprise to them, because they were actually placing a device underneath where the I.G.S. brass-cap was to be placed. This \"sub point\" was marked with the insignia of the Trilateral Commission, which was a triangle with a dot in the center, just as I had seen on the old Pojoaque viejo's work box from the \"p2\" 1937 Los Alamos project. The civilians (dre ssed as military) were very angry at him for having disobeyed instructions, especially in view of the fact that he had seen the concealed device being set into cement, beneath the surface, above which the I.G.S. brass-cap was to be placed.

Each of the secret geodetic points on our globe, placed at the vertices of geodetic triangles dividing our planet's surface, appa rently contains a crystal resonator set to respond to a distinct frequency, for navigating flying saucers (even unmanned ones), and even rockets, either manually, electronically, or by computer.

As a means for Secret Government world navigation, th e I.G.S. markers have been in place for forty years. Without the means for using them in 1950, they would have been useless. This survey, actually done for the Trilateralist world govern ment, under the \"cover\" of the I.G.S.—right under the noses of the United Nations teams, military au thorities, international committees, survey teams, and host countries—showed the awesome power of these world-wide conspirators, whose actions violated the sovereignty of nations, through the United Nations. This \"geodetic navigation system\" was a perfect solution for the flying saucer and for the Illuminati and Trilateral Commission, since it automatically involved triangular global areas generated by the \"great circles\" of the \"master builder\", according to the Genesis passages relied upon in the \"secret work\" of the \"Old Prussian\" Masonic Lodges based on the Johanite Gospel, the membership of whic h excluded Jews, and were forbidden to belong to \"humanitarian\" Masonry. The teachings of this Johanite Germ an Freemasonry included a dogmatic Christianity, and is rooted in the same, weird teachings of the former Jesuit priest and founder of the \"modern\" Illuminati in Bavaria, Adam Weishaupt. Out of this sprung the Thule Society and the Ahnenerbe Society, which figured strongly in the S.S., among whose founders was General Karl Haushoffer, the originator of the modern \"science\" utilized by \"our\" CIA, called \"Geopolitics\". The following three archival emblems show the transition from the Thule Society, the Deutsche Antarktische Stiftung (the German Arctic Expedition, with swastika and oak leaves showing Thule Society sponsorship), the \"globally conscious\" I.G.S.

Parapsychology would assist the 'geopoliticians' in maintaining mind control of particular populati ons, creating psychological conditioning conducive to unquestioned obedience to faceless authority. Th is system was ordered by John D. Rockefeller in 1923, when his people trained the SS and chose Hitler as the future leader ofthe Third Reich, as R & D for the fiiture mass-psychological contro l technology, now applied in America since 1945. In 1957, as a member of the Air Force—like all American armed forces managed according to the Sturm Abteilung (\"Storm Division\") Nazi troop management manual written by the 'synergist', Ernst Roehm, homosexual 'father' of Hitler's SA—I was assigned to Operations Intelligence, working in an 'SS library' as a monitor. I often heard the term \"geopolitics\", and logged various documents and books into and out of that library. I was literally surrounded and controlled by the trappings of the Nazis which had impressed our leaders so much that they officially 'adopted' them. The library was the creation of the Nazi intelligence network, the photos in the documents and books dating from that period and bearing overwritten German file indexes. There was practically no way for the U.S. government to have obtained such a 'library', other than from the files compiled during the Nazi invasion of Russia At the time of the German 'surrender', American authorities were deeply impressed with these materials, so thoroughly accumulated, catal ogued, and organized by Reinhard Gehlen's SS group, which included the monsters Heinrich Mueller and Reinhard Heydrich, that the CIA actually hired them in the U.S. under assumed names 1 . These files were used by the SS in the death camps and in sifting though the various Slavic \"slave peoples\" of the Soviet Union, to ferret out and murder Soviet Jewry, Gypsies, and others deemed \"inferior\". The documents acquired an ostensible 'new' purpose as barter and trade to an America which allowed itself to be drawn into a Cold War based on the dubious urgings of the Organization Gehlen's \"experts\", the new CIA's Soviet 'analysts' and 'specialists'—former SS intelligence officers—who convinced us that the Soviets were planning to attack us at any moment. We in SAC Intelligence could load the library into \"mobility boxes\" on a moment's notice, to take with us to a remote staging area nearer to the Soviet borders, in the event of the outbreak of war. But only after an invasion of the Soviet Union by us as conquerors, would the library assume its actual function because, other than the ostensible purely academic use as an 'invaluable reference libr ary', it still retained its true identity...as a reference to be used in the systematic subjugation of foreign peoples by Nazi conquerors. Almost a month before the fall of the Berlin Fuehrerbunker, Gehlen was already deeply bartering with selling American intelligence on the value of his organization, primarily on the basis of its contacts in and expertise on the Soviet Uni on. In retrospect, it appears that the long-range plan of the SS officers of Gehlen's organization was to get Hitler's revenge against \"Judaized America\", by offering themselves to us as \"intelli gence experts\" at a hefty profit, allowing them to survive intact as a secret sect within the secret core of our 'intelligence community', while embroiling us in a tortuous Cold War which lasted for almost fifty years. 1 Gregory Douglas, Gestapo Chief (three vols.), R.

These IllumiNazi Bi g Lies about \"aliens\" are disseminated through all the mass media. Someday there should be justice by public trial and punishment of the traitors who have perver ted the instruments of democracy, and are entitled to none of our protections, which they seek to destroy. They who have made war on our Bill of Rights and Constitution should have to defend themselves without their protections. Without our consent, the Secret Government is consciously waging psychological warfare against us, in violation of our right to government only by our consent. They use movies, T.V., books, magazines, advertisin g, children's stories, and all forms of propaganda, from the cradle to the grave, to criminally undermine and subvert the epistemological underpinnings of rational existence. We have not 'consented' to a fraud of which we are unaware. Our government, on behalf of the TC/C FR, has created the whole \"alien\" scenario, to brainwash us. So what is their purpose? To conceal flying saucer technology from us, and to stretch our credulities so we will believe the Big Lies. Control is the name of the game, and they have it. Flying saucer technology would break that control, so we don't have it. Are we a nation of wimps who will do nothing about it? According to one nutty writer 1 , the purpose is either to fabricate a phony alien threat, so as to unite the world u nder a one-world fascist/socialist TC/CFR/Bilderberger/Illuminati dictatorship , or to render the world's people into subservience to actual aliens with whom they have cut a deal, and he thinks it is all the fault of the Masons. Unfortunately, neither of these conclusion s is correct, though the first one contains a germ of truth, in the fabrication of a phony alien threat, but in view of the two purposes I stated above, this wacky theory is perceived as just as misinformational as the crap emitted by the CIA' s or O.N.I.'s covert agents in UFOlogy. The phony 'alien' threat was derived from a public speech by R onald Reagan regardi ng the effects of an hypothetical alien threat, which in a paranoid's mind, is the kind of hype to be used to appeal to a bewildered constituency, so they can be unwittingly used to spread the dumb idea that the alien propaganda is intended to scare us into the arms of the NWO, or is a leak from the inside regarding a deal the government has with the aliens. Such wacky propaganda is induced by a shell game: \"Will those who have lost track of the real issue please raise their hands.\" The real issue is saucer technology. The controllers get their control over us with our money. The TC/CFR bunch have exclusive control over the saucer, since it is the most perfect instrument for 'world surveillance', and because its availability to the public would eventually destroy the economic power they now wield over us, through their c ontrol over energy, transportation and communications resources which we pay them for every day, so we \"can't have it\".

These fact s show the ultimate treason through which these people have abused us, the 'paying' and purported 'owning' parties, while the CRF/TC enjoy exclusive use of 'our' saucers as 'their' special tools. The second idea, that our government may have cut a deal with \"aliens\", was just plumb dumb. It was so dumb, that William C ooper, one of those who adopted this story, changed his tune the moment he bought a copy of my first edition, with the idea that he could abandon his old stuff and take credit fo r my claim of \"exclusively human origin\", so long as he never cited my book or told an yone that I had 'convert ed' him to the idea, but people noticed anyway, drat it ! But Cooper still doesn't get it. The manipulators of the TC/CFR have the mentalities of sociopathic ants. Their whole method was copied, then cynically perverted from an original idea of Nikola Tesla, before the ultimate destruction of the League of Nations, eventually brought about by Cecil Rhodes' British Round Table Group, and its American branch, which fused in 1919 into the new international British-American organization, known in America as the CFR (\"Council on Foreign Rela tions\"), and in Britain as the I.I.A. (\"Institute for International Affairs\"). Te sla had naively offered his flying saucer invention to the Geneva C onvention and League of Natio ns, as an ultimate 'police vehicle' with which to patrol the world to maintain peace. His dislike of the new British-American organization was reflected by his disillusionment when the League of Nations was emasculated by the new group. Meanwhile, the CFR/IIA was stealing his greatest invention, for its own exclusive use in the inobsequious world dictatorship we now have, us ing covert manipulation by war. Rather than maintaining peace, the wa r profiteers create the divide-and-conquer conditions leading to wars, profiting by them , then use the resultant wars, surrenders and 'peace negotiations' as pretexts to constantly restructure the world, profiting by them. The man who stabbed Tesla in the back, then twisted the hi lt, was none other than J.P. Morgan, a member of the CFR, who was already a dictator of American energy and communications. Morgan suckered Tesla in, in a most treacherous and sadistic manner, seeking to completely crush him emotionall y, driving him into a psychological turmoil and destitution from which he was never intended to return. The TC/CFR/IIA like things just the way they have them, don't want to rock the boat, and fear most of all, significant ch ange, since fluxing of conditions could induce unpredictable widespread free communications , which could awaken the people to the scam. That is the reason they sought to shut down the computer Internet in 1995. When they control the purse strings of the world, and soak up all the revenues of the people of America just to pay the interest on our 'natio nal debt', why would they want an obvious 'world dictatorship', which would kill the goose that laid the golden egg? So long as we slaves keep our noses to the grindstones, they have it made. The only thing which would induce them to take drastic action, would be if the public suddenly becomes aware of the Big Picture.

Though the Bilderberg group's public emerge nce can be traced to 1952, its name supposedly derived from the place of their sup posed \"first meeting\" at the Bilderberg Hotel in Holland in 1954. This group has a much older, but perhaps not so clear, origin. \"Bilderberger\" is a German word meaning \"picture merchant\", denoting the internationalists who have for centuries used paintings and art as a store of wealth, as a hedge against inflation, and as a compact me ans of transportation of their wealth from one country to the other. That is the reas on so many unscrupulous and ruthless people, such as Armand Hammer, have had so much of their wealth tied up in valuable paintings and other art. And that is where the famous Dutch Hotel got its name, since these people came so often to Holland to conceal the loot which they as dictators or just plain high-placed thieves, had accumulated in the countries which they had so often throughout history, stripped of wealth. For centuries, Holland was the place to di scretely buy and sell valuable pieces of art, and to convert them into and out of th e various currencies of the world at current values, avoiding inflation, taxes and prying eyes. The Dutch, like the Swiss and their banking interests, have always been acco mmodating, and named a hotel after their infamous guests, many years before the form al meeting in 1954. I first heard about the Bilderbergers in 1960, from a person w ho had known about them since before the depression. I once knew an old Dutchman who as a boy at the turn of the century, acted as an inconspicuous, secret cour ier, riding his bicycle, carry ing various currencies for the Bilderbergers from country to country in the lo wlands, usually at night, until he received a serious, life-long injury when he was run over by a coach one rainy dark night. The TC/CFR/Secret Government, has consis tently used the m ass media to convince us that flying saucers are from outer space, rather than being man-made, and to my knowledge, this is the first book or any ot her media production, which makes the unequivocal, categorical assertion that they are exclusively man-made, and that NO EVIDENCE EXISTS ON EARTH OF ANYTHING EVER BEING \"MADE\" EXCEPT BY HUMAN BEINGS. If anyone believes that the use of mass media for such purposes is just \"harmless entertainment\", they should have watched th e two-part miniseries, Intruders, aired by C.B.S. on May 17 and 19, 1992. The scenario left no doubt that the intent was to beg the question that flying saucers are \"extra terrestrial spacecraft\", to intimidate and threaten us, and to falsely convince us of the following ominous things: OSTENSIBLE MESSAGE: (a) That aliens are \"with us\"; (b) that our government \"knows it\"; (c) that the government's policy of secrecy is \"for our own good\" and \"justified\"; (d) that the government will hurt you if you don't comply; (e) that anyone who actively resists, will commit \"professional su icide\", or worse.

In examining these hoaxes, one cannot fa il to see a connection to the ancient Sumerians, Egyptians, and their worship of Osiris, as well as other ancient esoteric suggestions, which is because the Nazi intelligence planners in the CIA are fond of such esoterica. In my chapters III and VI, I give you some of the mythological foundations for this religion, which is over 6,000 years old. The Egyptians, who did not originate this belief system, which came from Asia, used a whole system of myths to control everything, just as the Illuminati does today. This has been a role model for totalitarian designers throughout history. The Egyptians ' 'enemies'—the Sea Peoples, Assyrians, Babylonians, Amorites, Sumerians, Akkadians, Chaldeans, Greeks, etc.—shared this same ancient nature religion, and could be 'spiritually' manipulated by Egypt, which practiced the religion in its most highly classicized form, the Mecca of sun worship, just as Rome became the home of the Roman Cath olic Church. This is the \"secret of the ages\": Mysticism! Those who can be suckered in by it, are putty in the mystics' hands, the hands of those who only use mysticism as a means of control. And those who resist, can be killed by those who follow, all in the name of \"God\", \"Ra\", \"Mohammed\", \"Stalin\", \"The Fatherland\", etc. Marx stated that \"religion is the opiate of the people\", but he failed to point out that he also was a religious mystic, who asked his followers to believe in the \"mystical power\" of THE CO LLECTIVE, on faith rather than reason. I would further define \"mystics\", as those who seek to gain values from others, or to deny others the use of their own minds as individu als, on the basis of \"special powers\" which can't be proven and must be accepted on \"fa ith\", so as to control them. This always involves some form of mysticism, as any c on-artist could tell you. And the bottom line is, THERE ARE NO MYSTICAL SECRETS! Socialism, Communism, Fascism and Naziis m are inventions of the IUuminati, theo-statist \"masks\", which make the citizens pay for their own bureaucratic enslavement and \"social and economic benefits\", while the elite remain in secret control of the world, increasing and using their illici tly gained profit and power for themselves, without bearing any responsibility for the wrongs they inflict, since the guilt for this is thereby scapegoated to the citizens and thei r puppetized 'leaders'.

CORNY GOVERNMENT SPECIAL EFFECTS AND HOAX SCENARIOS: The Roswell Rhesus Monkey Hoax and Other Such Outrageous Shams In the late '40s, when Hollywood's emer ging \"space age\" special effects were funky and humorous by today's standards, the special effects of the personnel of Holloman A.F.B. at Alamogordo, White Sand s Missile Range, and Walker Air Force Base at Roswell, were even funkier. They executed the stupid 1947 hoax which is sometimes called the \"MJ-12\" incident or \"The Roswell Incident\", but which I call \"The Roswell Rhesus Monkey Hoax\". Until 1952, Wernher von Braun was working at Ft. Bliss (as Director of Research, U.S. Army Ordnance Guided Missile Command), from which post he continued to conduct V-2 (A-9 , V-6, V-7) tests at nearby White Sands ALIENS 116"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Proving Grounds, while other tests were being conducted on the rocket sled at Alamogordo, using rhesus monk ies in G-suits, to determine the limits of human G-force endurance and other problems of high performance flight in conventional high performance aircraft (necessary to sustain conventional aeronautic s on a high level in order to stave off demands for the saucer t echnology in national security groups). In 1952, the researchers switched to chimpanzee s in A-9 tests. The chimps were much easier to control and less dangerous an d problematic for pe rsonnel to handle. In the original 1947 hoax, a small, comi c-strip-type flying sa ucer—around twelve feet in. diameter, constructed of stock sh eet aluminum, rivets, screws, bar stock and molding, with a plastic \"bubble-canopy\" for the 'pilot', and an old automotive antenna with a ball on its tip projecting from the t op of the bubble—was placed in a spot about four miles from Walker A.F.B., on the ra nch of a cooperating co-conspirator. Four rhesus monkies, which had been shaved, dyed green, and outfitted with corny little \"space suits\", complete with little 'space' he lmets, were strewn near the fake saucer. News leaks were arranged by the intelligen ce \"E. & D\" (Evaluation and Dissemination) Officer, as the 'crashed alien flying saucer' and the four 'space aliens' were 'found' by the military authorities. Just like in a third-grade play, only this scenario was worse. Just imagine \"Peter Pan\" being performed by a bunch of G.I.s. The Alamogordo intelligence personnel even purchased the green pigment—dry tempera pigment—from our family business, an d I even showed them how to apply it by rubbing it on dry, just like on \"limed oak\" furniture I showed people how to finish. Our business was the best art supply, decorating a nd paint contracting business in the region, and Alamogordo had none. My father and I even decorated the new house of Robert O. Anderson, in Hondo (near Roswell) about 1951. By our present standards, the mock flying saucer was a grossly amateurish attempt to foist a corny hoax upon the public. 'L eaks' to the news media, including a few ridiculous photos of the saucer (which woul d have been prohibited if the events were true), and the dead monkies in the corny 'space suits' (the monkey-sized G-suits used in the acceleration experiments), were publicized in newspapers, and eventually found then- way to magazines, despite the immediate attempts by the startled and angered Pentagon officials to retrieve all the evidence. Th e whole confused scenario and withdrawn publishings, created even more weirdness. One of the P.I.O.s (Public Information Officers) of Army Air Corps Intelligence, Walther Haut, sent out the initial press releases to area newspapers, announcing th e recovery of an \"alien flying saucer\", including 8\" x 10\" black and white glossies, sh owing the 'captured' saucer and 'aliens'. Haut, who now runs a \"Flying Saucer Museum \" in Roswell, New Mexico, has made no references to those photos in any of his rece nt statements. That is because he was then, and still is, an employee of the intelligence community. Fortunately for the Pentagon, the photos were sent only to re gional, small-town letterpre ss newspapers, few of which possessed the means to reproduce the photos in 1947, without first having half-tone photo-engravings produced in larger cities. This gave the Pentagon more time to get most of them back before publication, or to st op the papers before they were distributed. In preparing for the hoax, regional mili tary intelligence pe rsonnel had created a 'crash site' with a bull dozer, on the rancher's property, by making a huge gash in the ground. Whoever was handling the dozer that day was a bit heavy-handed. The 'saucer' however, was obviously a stupid hoax, as ther e was no way that the flimsy little craft, without a dent or hole in it, could have plow ed such a gaping hole in the hard and rocky, ALIENS 117"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"sun-baked desert ground. The photos of the 12- foot diameter fake saucer had become known to many people, yet today, I seem to be the only person who recalls them. Since the initial photos—already prepared before the crash—were issued immediately after the purported 'crash', personnel had insufficient ti me to fabricate the fake saucer afterward, so the initial photos from the Army Air Corps, of the original fake saucer, without a speck of dust or a dent on it, represented physical evidence of the hoax perpetrated by them. Further proof that the photos were ta ken before the hoax was executed was the fact that the junky little saucer was photographed in a hanger (at Walker or Holloman), while the \"aliens\" (i.e., rhesus monkies, co mpletely dressed in their G-suits), were photographed in an Air Force laboratory, not at the hospital, most probably at Holloman A.F.B. at Alamogordo. That was prior to their removal to the hoax site, thence to the infirmary at Roswell. After the hoax, the G- suits were removed for 'medical' purposes, except for a couple of the monkies, which we re raising a horrible stench, because they had relieved their bow els in the G-suits, upon death days before, and the hot desert sun had accelerated the fermentation of the monkey excreta and corpses, after their removal from the morgue at Holloman. Years later, a photo of a supposedly ope rational, 60-foot di ameter, jet-powered saucer designed by Schriever in WWII Germany, was leaked, but that scenario was withdrawn, since it verified a German saucer program, although a disinformational branch intended to hide the true electrical ly-powered project at Peenemunde. The initial evidence which reached certain members of the public, had already revealed the initial hoax to intelligent but somewhat confused witnesses. The latter leaked photo showing the Nazi saucer designed by Schriever, made in Czechoslovakia during the war, part of the saucer stuff rounded up by General Patt on and transported to New Mexico along with the rest of the German saucer proj ects, around September, 1945, under Operation Paperclip. Since it wasn't one of the highly classified \"electro-saucers\", the photo did little harm, and had a 'professionally constructed' appearance, intended to overcome the poor craftsmanship and design of the fake saucer. It was a 'withdrawn hoax', however, since it tended to acknowledge a crash which conflicted with the later \"weather balloon hoax\" concocted by the Pentagon to conceal the first bungled hoax. Because of all the gross stupidities and mi scalculations on the part of the initial huxters, the initial scenario was obliterated by subsequent weather balloon stuff which was only slightly less stupid, but the initia l 1947 hoax, 38 years before the third, 1985 \"MJ-12\" hoax, still contained 'salvageable pa rts' as far as the Pentagon huxters were concerned. The Pentagon team had taken great pains to carefully obliterate and omit the dumb photos of the original saucer and m onkies, which clearly smells of a Pentagon \"cover-up\" of its hoax, while, the public, mo st of whom never saw the photos, failed to realize that what was being \"covered up\" wa s not an \"alien crash\", but an unauthorized 'wildcat' hoax, not cleared through the Pentagon, created by ex-Nazi military 'intelligence' personnel, which was bungled by lack of special effects expertise. The 'salvageable' parts of the first hoa x, which provided the precedent of a mystified 'alien saucer' incident, together with the 'government cover-up', were reborn as a third, MJ-12 hoax, complete with a set of fake, newly created and planted 'presidential orders', obtained through th e \"freedom of information act\" This new scenario was written by a team of Ph.D.s, su bmitted to a secret committee, and approved by them.

In order for the government to drop back to the second hoax, it was necessary for them to admit that the third, MJ-12 hoax, was a hoax. It took them some time to realize that the second hoax was bett er, because it allowed them to simply deny questions about 'aliens' which did not in rea lity exist. Also, it was necessary to insure, through their control of UFOlogy groups, that only the 'right' (i.e., \"wrong\") questions were asked in the petition now known as \"The Roswell Statement\". It would seem that, with the 38-year laps e between the first and second hoax, they could have done a better job, but alas, th e government bunglers screwed up again. The error involved slander and fraud against de ceased presidents Truman and Eisenhower, by forging their names on false documents which alleged an incident which never occurred. Such fraud and slander should not have been treated so lightly by law enforcement authorities in respect to the arrogant Pentagon officials, who clearly overstepped their authority, by falsifying actions taken by former (deceased) commanders-in-chief, ex post facto. At the time of my 1993 first edition I wa s unaware that the original photos had become completely 'unavailable'. Though I wa s unable to find my copies of them to include in this book, I assumed they were kno wn to the usual saucer investigator, and proceeded to point out facts which I thought would be obvious to anyone examining them. Then I was astounded in late 1993, to discover that no 'civilians' involved in UFOlogy knew of or said a thing about the ol d photos. I knew that I hadn't seen the two photos, given to me in 1970 by a newsman, or my magazine showing the photos, since 1974. These stupid photos infuriated Pentagon o fficials, by revealing the identities of the \"aliens\" as shaved rhesus monkies, in a hoax which was an amateurish attempt to convince the public that the German flying sauc ers seen by so many people in the area, were \"extraterrestrial\". The Pentagon would never have approved the hoax beforehand, and the original hoax, as perpetrated, would never have held up, because it was too amateurishly funny! What the photos showed, as purported \"space aliens\", were shaved rhesus monkies, wearing monkey-sized, machine-sewn, G-suits with the pressure lines and lacings, equipped with oxygen tubes, helmets, and ot her equipment, identical to those of the X-15 rocket plane test pilots, for whose be nefits the monkey tests were conducted, to accumulate data from rocket sled tests at Alamogordo, on the outer parameters of G-forces which humans could withstand. The helmets concealed the small sizes of the upper craniums of the monkeys, later exaggerated in the \"off icial standard alien\" model. In view of the original hoax, the MJ- 12 documents were apparently intended to retroactively convince us that \"space alie ns\" from millions of light years away, possessing 'superior intelligence', had come to Roswell. It was contemplated that the public could still be convinced of this, prov ided the scenario was presented without the photos, which by the poor judgment of th e 1947 military intelligence personnel were considered \"convincing\". The third-rate 'sauce r kitsch'—the rhesus monkies in G-suits, and the junky little saucer of such poor craf tsmanship that a California hot-rodder would have been ashamed—had to be concealed. The recently fabricated 'presidential orders' of \"MJ-12\" were intended to resuscitate the original \"aliens\"—minus the dumb photos—despite the obvious fact that beings of sufficiently high intelligence would never have contacted jerks at Roswell or Alamogordo, or even Area 51, unless there was ALIENS 119"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"a reasonably expectable opportunity to contac t the most powerful pol itical leader in the world, and even an idiot wouldn't make th at mistake!

I have also worked in the movie industry, and can assure you that these efforts were grossl y incompetent! Poor props, poor sets, poor makeup, poor acting, poor script, and poor production. Worse than Radar Men From the Moon. I also believe the hoax was cooked up by ex-Nazi Holloman intelligence personnel, rather than Walker or White Sand s personnel, because the monkies were used there, the saucers were used there, and because Walker, as the \"fall guy\" base for the hoax, would create a distraction from the real perpetrators. Walker was a basic flight training base, with a few old bombers from an old atomic bomb wing (which at one time possibly included the Enola Gay, if my recollection is correct), mothballed there after the war, until the base was closed down sometime in the late '50s or early '60s. Holloman, an advanced flight-test base whic h also defended the whole top secret area with a fighter-interceptor group, performed highly classified test s in conjunction with White Sands Missile Range, and in respec t to Wernher von Braun's intended manned (rocket) moon missions, which were probably shams to cover an earlier mission in the electro-propulsive Graf Zeppelin. Data produce d at Alamogordo was used in the design of future rocket planes, jet fighters and bomb ers, flying saucers, and eventually, stealth planes (very expensive shams to cover saucer stuff). Another reason the MJ-12 hoax related back to the old rhesus monkey hoax, was to utilize the weird 1947 image of the shaved monkies, which had b ecome the 'official standard alien model' approved by the secret committees, to be useful in back-dating the more recent plans of extended fraud. The monkies, with their large, glassy, slanted eyes, small chins and mouths, and skinny bodies, are close enough to \"E.T.\" to make a stab at it, at least in the retarded minds of the govern ment plagiarists, and if need be, could be faked by small human actors, even child actors, midgets, or small, skinny women actors, in space suits, wearing latex masks with sunglass-lens eyes. The dark lenses conceal the human eyes, and create an eerie effect. The more recent wave of \"alien\" movies from Hollywood—many having nothin g to do with this hoax—seem to have given the huxters a new life, by providing a body of more re cent movies from which to plagiarize and sponge new 'spin-off hoaxes. There are also now many more competent special effects, prop-building, and makeup technicians ava ilable within the intelligence community. Government agents posing as concerned citizen \"UFOlogists\"—also mimicked by unwitting dupes falsely induced by them—recently have naively revived this old incident, alleging that a \"government cover- up\" in 1947, concealed \"evidence of aliens from space\", and secret collaboration between them and our 'brilliant' military ALIENS 120"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"authorities and government. If that were true , they certainly didn't do a very good job of it! Even if genuine, the MJ-12 presidential documents could not have been obtained through the freedom of information act. Go vernment agents (\" UFOlogists\") have agonizingly gone through the whole \"Freedom Of Information Act\" act, to obtain these \"secret documents\", for use in their propaganda war against us; warmed over hash, four times over. That's supposed to ma ke this sham more believable? The fake MJ-12 documents were intentio nally ambiguous, since the embarrassingly stupid photos may still pop up. They have protected their flanks by ambivalent statements, intended to plant more seeds of doubt, to stretch the credulity and 'open the minds' of the gullible, to wallow holes in their credibilities large enough to cram the most recently approved official versions of the BIG LIES into. I lived just to the south of Roswell in 1947, and picked up the truth by \"social osmosis\". Three of the dead rhesus monkies had been stored in a morgue at Holloman, after being killed in acceleration experiments on the rocket sled. The four th monkey was almost dead, and so was included with the three other dead ones used in the hoax. To make my 'social osmosis' more complete, the story that the \"aliens\" were shaved and dyed rhesus monkies in G-suit s, originally came to me through family connections, since my brother-in-law's aunt was the \"nurse who later became a nun\". As a nurse, she was present during the alleged \"autopsy\" (actually a dissection). Being a U.S. Army nurse who was a New Mexico survivor of the Bataan Death March, she easily recognized the rhesus monkies, since she had been forced by the Japanese to cook and eat rhesus monkies for food in the Bataan Peninsula. Leona, her sister, told me about it in 1958, but I'd already heard the story through my sister, Ramona, in 1953. I detail more on this under \"Golden Cups , Monkey Business, and a Lot of Bull\". In 1995, just before my second edition went to press, I inserted information about seeing an old, 1947 Kodak color print made by the Roswell Ar my dissectors' photo assistant, during the dissecti on. That photo was acquired by a man named Bart Wilson, who had told me that he was negotiating with Time-Life Publications and the Sightings TV show people, for sale of the photo. Bart 's family member had been in U.S. Army intelligence in Roswell in 1947, which is how he got the photo. I obtained this additional information after Bart's sale, too late to include in my second edition. Bart's photo showed the splayed facial mu sculature of a rhesus monkey, pinned out in typical fashion on a board to be photographed for 'documentation' purposes. I immediately recognized it as the musculature of a monkey because the muscles were cut from around the two ears, which produced two strange almond shapes above the cut- outs for the eyes, when stretched out on the board. Bart wouldn't let me make a copy of the photo, as his potential purchasers had insisted on his not doing that. A few days after Bart showed me the phot o for the first time, in the Villa Linda mall in Santa Fe, where Bart's computer imag ing and photo processing business was at that time, I mentioned to Bart that the photo verified what I said about the rhesus monkies, and he said he had a firm commitment from the Sightings people. A couple of days later, I just happened to be at To ys-R-Us, located a few hundred yards across the parking lot from Bart's busine ss. As I waited for my son to look at some toys, looking out a window facing Bart's business loca tion, a tan colored government Hummer pulled up in the parking space directly in front of my view. A man got out and walked directly across the parking lot to Bart's business. I went from the building and looked at the ALIENS 121"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Hummer. The front had a \"CIA\" plate, and on the passenger side there was a notice: \"Property of Central Intelligence Agency: For Official Business Only.\" I checked with Bart later, and he said he had concluded his sale of the photo print to the \"Sightings\" people on the day I saw the guy in the Hummer walk into Bart's business. I told him the guy arrived in a CIA Hummer, and we both had a laugh. I told him there was no chance that the photo will ev er be seen by the public now, which is further proof not only that the \"Sightings\" s how is produced by the CIA, but that they are concealing the \"monkey business\". It is what a friend calls another one of my \"statistically challenging\" expe riences, that I just happened to be at Toys-R-Us, where the CIA man had parked his Hummer, hundreds of yards from Bart's business, in order to avoid the detection by people like me, of his purchase of the photo from Bart. The following facsimile news clipping rela ted to the government's covert revival of the Roswell \"alien\" effort. Under the F.O.I.A., a flock of CIA UFOl ogy sheep go \"Baa-aa, baa-aa, baa-aa!\", asking, in O.S.I.-prepared questionnaires, for \"concealed evidence\" of a crash which never occurred, involving \"aliens\" which were monkies, and \"secret contact\" between ALIENS 122"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"\"extraterrestrials\" and our government which never occurred. The \"official\" government response was easy, merely to deny every (CIA-loaded) leading question asked. Predictably, the \"UFOlogists\" asked the wrong questions, so the government was 100% correct in denying 1) knowledge of an 'alien UFO crash' at Roswell in 1947 (since there was no crash, and since, if there had been, it would have been a government flying saucer), and 2) that 'alien bodies' (e ither three or four) were recovered (since a crash never occurred, and si nce the bodies 'recovered' were of rhesus monkies in G-suits). If the group had asked \"Was there a government-conducted hoax at Roswell in 1947, in which the bodies of rh esus monkies (or other primat es) were dressed in G-suits (or other costumes designed to look like 'space suits'), to make them appear to be those of 'alien astronauts'?\" And, \"Did the Penta gon officials retrieve evidence of this first hoax, and cover it up with a second hoax, in which fragments of a weather balloon were substituted?\" The old adage, \"If you ask a stupid question, you get a stupid answer\" applies. PHONY EXPERT CONSULTANTS AND GOVERNMENT SCRIPTS The same Arthur C. Clarke who was inv ited to Keesler by the Air Force in 1956 (whom I called a liar to his face), has been a consultant on many movies involved in this massive hoax, such as 2001: A Space Odysse y, etc. Although such movies as Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. ar e heartwarming, poetically wishful, and life-affirming, the underlying message such movies deliver—whether by intent or because their makers were duped—is to beg the question that \"UFOs\" are \"extraterrestrial\", despite the fact that there is absolutely no known evidence or personal knowledge, verified by any human being, of there being anything made by intelligent ALIENS 123"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"being from beyond our earth. Yet the same Arthur Clarke who in 1956 said saucers \"didn't exist\", was later involved in these e fforts to convince us that they not only existed, but were the exclusive property of \"aliens\" from outer space. The half-truth and the truth-and-a-half, again. Every single intelligently formed, fabricat ed or compounded substance we know of is human-made. The tasks of our government's secret agencies, involved in such movies, are made progressively easier over the years, by the victims (us) already having been duped and brainwashed by the constant, fa lse propaganda drilled into them from the mass media, controlled by BIG BROTHER, fo r over 50 years. The general public, once known to trust \"government experts\", has become more skeptical, with their blind trust rapidly waning, realizing that th eir trust was falsely procured. A movie like E.T., which may have been intended purely as entertainment, still functionally brainwashes kids before they are mature enough to question our government's actions, motives, or integrity. Realistically-i ntelligent people, who may never have seen a single flying saucer, usually categorically disbelieve their existence. Oddly enough, many of those same people al so disbelieve politicia ns, and recognize the fact that our government is manipulated by large corporatio ns, in a secret corporate-state partnership. So why shouldn't they realize that the movie and T.V. industries aren't immune? The movie industry has been used extensively as a propaganda medium since its inception. Not all of the propaganda ha s been false, bad, harmful or evil. But government-backed movies which subliminally brainwash the public into accepting a Platonist epistemology, to make people easier to control, trivializes man's existence, destroys individual autonomy, self-esteem, confidence, and self-determination, and builds false dependency on the government. It also abridges church-state separation, by promoting a religion of \"psychic phenomena\" , pseudo-science, mysticism, \"UFOlogy\", ignorance, \"new age\" charlatanism, a nd blanket acceptance of the existence of extraterrestrials on faith rather than reason. The fact is, Hitler and his crowd—who originally created these hoaxes—were \"new-agers\", who were only wa y ahead of their time. They spread the false propaganda, through a \"whispering campaign\", that they al one were in contact wi th alien Venusians, in Peru 2 , and that they had been \"specially chosen\" by the \"advanced race of aliens\", as the \"master race\" to lead earthling society. In the meanwhile, the Nazis believed the contradiction that, as the master race, their \"orders\" were received from an underground race of giants, who controlled the human r ace from their underground empire, the main entrance into which was in Tibet. Does this scenario significantly differ from the Trilateral Commission/Illuminati/New World Or der/UFOlogy versions? And in a certain way, doesn't it bear a remarkable similarity to stories in the Bible, the Torah, and the Talmud, in which the Christia n or Jewish people were s upposedly chosen by God or Yahweh, while the various alleged racial and 'spiritual' inferiorities of their enemies were enumerated? And, since the particular proportions and design of the swastika used by Hitler and the Nazis, was the \"17-square anagram\" swastika of the Jewish Kaballah, it appears that Hitler also drew from that s ource as a basis for his own new religion, at no fault of today's Jews of the world, most of whom we should hope no longer consider non-Jews to be inferior as stat ed in the Torah and the Talmud. 2 Louis Pauwels & Jacques Bergier, The Morning of the Ma gicians, Stein and Day/Scar borough House, N.Y.

ALIENS 124"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"The people who make these Secret Gove rnment propaganda movies, are usually unaware of their backers' hidden agendas, and are 'motivated at their own levels', by a desire for success and profit. There have been only a few movies, to my knowledge, which have touched upon the truth, and they ha ve been more or less banished to oblivion or presented as ridiculous farces. One was The Formula, starring Marlon Brando, David Huddleston, and George C. Scott. Another starred Hoyt Axton (I don't recall the title, and there is no information available at video stores either. Perhaps it was a made-for-T.V. movie.). It showed cattle mutilations being conducted by government operatives using helicopters a nd other strange aircraft. Another movie, Rage, starring George C. Scott, also had strong implications , especially in respect to military Masons involved in covering up a gove rnment nerve gas \"accident\". The Formula involved the technological secr et of making gasoline from coal. The technology is known today as \"acetylene chem istry\", and is available in many chemistry texts. The secret originated in the 1930s with an American, the former director of the Colorado Bureau of Mines, who sought a pa tent on what was then called the \"Parry Retort\", a refinery and process which cracke d a gasoline-like fracti on out of acetylene. (Acetylene, or calcium carbide, was originally produced by burning coal in the presence of crushed limestone.) I have seen a copy of the original patent application. The refinery was similar to gasoline refineries, with nu merous 'retorts' or 'cracking towers', to separate out or synthesize various hydroca rbon fractions from the acetylene, using what are today standard catalysts such as platinum black, palladium black, etc. The F.B.I, took over the plant, and barred Parry from entr y, use, or sale. The technology then came into the exclusive possession of the Nazis—via the Rockefeller interests—who used it during WW II. The Formula scenario picked it up from there, mentioning its transfer (back) to Gulf Oil Company (a Rockefelle r company), along with the flying saucer, during the \"amnesty deal\" with the Germans at th e end of the war, which I am the first to expose. Parry's daughter, whom I have known fo r over twenty years, was unfortunately manipulated by the \"Friend\" who trained \"The Two\"—the couple involved in perpetrating extraterre strial hoaxes through th e O.S.I.R.I.S. front group created by the \"Friend\"—and Jacques Vallee, into stealing my photos of th e fake alien saucer and the rhesus monkies in G-suits. She was also us ed by CIA-backed people fraudulently suing me, enabling their fraudulent judgments by theft of my trial exhibits, with the unmistakable complicity of the New Mexico courts. The mental instability of the daughter, who has been incarcerated in sanita riums several times, was exploited by these huxters. She was so eager for gallery contacts for her art work, that she was willing to do almost anything for the \"Frie nd\" (a CIA pseudo-art dealer, with bad taste). She caused me to miss a trial in a case filed against me by a member of the CFR/IIA, also having connections to the Chicago \"Organization\". I love good movies. Movies which faced th e realities of flying saucers as man-made machines, would be more exciting than thos e we've seen. Imagine sitting in the cockpit of one of those babies, clipping along at 2.5 miles per second, with 360-degree view-screens, fed by image i nverters! You stop over the enem y camp (the Trilateralists or Bilderbergers), and zoom in on their most guarded secrets with one of your super magnifying image intensifiers, from an altitude so high that you are entirely invisible from the ground, in broad daylight, and do not appear on radar e ither. Incidentally, \"stealth\" technology was first developed fo r Nazi U-boats and fl ying saucers. Most ALIENS 125"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"probably, the \"striations\" I identified on the hull of the saucer I saw in 1953, were for this purpose, since that was the wa y the technology worked at the time. A good example of one of the newer, slicker propaganda movies, was Hanger 18 (1980, Taft International Pictures, Inc.; Wo rldvision Enterprises, Inc.) It was produced by Charles Sellier, Jr., and the cast in cluded Gary Collins, Robt. Vaughn, Joseph Campanella, Darrin McGavin, and James Hampton. These are some of the same actors often appearing in Secret Government ps eudo-documentaries or pseudo-expose-type pictures. An opening statemen t was \"...brave eyewitnesses have stepped forward and now the story can finally be told\". This hypocritical statement should more appropriately have said \"...cow ardly liars have stepped forward, and now the Big Lie can finally be told\". There was ample government involvement (use of the air base at Big Spring, Texas, cooperation of NASA, etc.). The plot involved a fictitious satellite explosion, caused by a collision with a \"UFO\", whic h was hovering near an orbiting NASA space shuttle dock. One of the several astronaut-witnesses was killed by the explosion (heroes all), also killing the saucer's alien pilot, after which the saucer made an automatic controlled landing in Bannon Co., Arizona (w hy always the desert?). Two of the astronauts sought to expose a \"government cover-up\" conspiracy, and were hunted down by government agents, who killed one of them. In spite of the phony sympathy created for 'those who sought to expose the government's concealment of alien contact', the film took every opportunity to plug NASA and the space program, while creating apprehension by implied death threats against potential witnesses who attempt to tell the real truth. A typical line (Vaughn): \"So what you're saying, General, is that we have a flying saucer in our possess ion?\", (as if to say that \"we\" did not!). Hanger 18 was supposedly a secret NASA ha nger \"...within fifty miles of Midland, Texas...\" (presumably Big Spring). The plot included the theory that ancient markings on earth, such as those on the Plains of N asca in Peru, or Totonac writings—based on phony-baloney linguistic comparisons—were the same as those found inside the fictitious UFO. The \"Hanger 18\" incident was just another government-concocted hoax like the MJ-12 and Roswell hoaxes, only with better technical and conceptual work. By 1994, my first edition kicked up e nough dust to spur a Viacom Pictures, made-for-TV movie, Roswell, starring Kyle McLachlan, Charlie Sheen, Dwight Yoakam, etc., produced by Ilene Kahn, et c., (based on the Kevin Randle and Don Schmitt book, UFO Crash at Roswell). They even had a spooky 'bad guy' exclaim to Kyle McLachlan, \"It was just a bunch of rhesus monkies!\" (a direct quote from my book, and a front page Albuquerq ue Journal North newspape r article on me and my book, of Jan. 6, 1994). I find it odd that attribution was not present in the Randles/Schmitt book, which showed the real motive for doing the movie, based on a book which could be bent to government purpose s, if it was not initially commissioned by the government, similar to how the \"Frie nd\" had tried to commission me to write a book attributing the petroglyphs to extrat errestrials. By 1994, Schmitt and Randle weakly attempted to address th e rhesus theory raised by me, without saying who raised it, in their later book, The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell, the title alone of which showed their OSI affiliation, since they have always k nown there was no \"UFO crash at Roswell\", but a \"fake crash\".

He changed his story, saying the weather balloon debris was there for two weeks before he reporte d it. This created the suspici on that he was paid off to conceal a real alien crash, and to account for the time between the first hoax and the second hoax. Besides, they would have had to pay him again for a second hoax. Approximately one week after the Journal North article, as I returned home from Santa Fe at dusk to Lamy, I saw a very large flying saucer (appearing to be at least 100 feet in diameter), hovering within a qua rter mile across Apache Canyon (A.K.A., \"Galisteo River\") to my east, which was pu tting out a large amount of coronal flame. Though I am not in a habit of photographing ev ery saucer I see, I ran for my camera, because it was a good sighting that my camera could have captured, but before I could get set up, it was gone. It traveled across the Eldorado Subdivision to my north, and moved on a bee-line across the southern periph ery of Santa Fe, into the northeasterly end of the Jemez mountains, toward the \"technical areas\" in the southwest side of the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratories, where the sa ucers fly quite often. I discussed it with some friends in Eldorado, and they said they saw it and reported it to the Santa Fe County Sheriffs Department, and were told that three other witnesses had already reported it. Friends in Canoncito also confirmed their sighting of the saucer. It was as if the government had placed an obvious and larg e saucer in the area, just to see if my book or the article had produced any effect on the local population. The saucer sightings have been so prevalent and outrageously obvious in the past, over the Canoncito area, that I would have found them disturbing if I ha d lived over there, and they have at times been irritating in my own area around eight mi les to the east, but I am further from the tip of the southern Sangre de Christos, wher e the government has chosen to place them so often at night. Presence of lower altitude saucers in this area have noticeably diminished since the book and this news article, even though the public has been brainwashed to 'not see them' anyway. MY \"FRIEND\", THE M.I.B. \"M.I.B.\" is an acronym for \"Men In Black\", the Secret Government spooks who often show up to harass witnesses. My reference to a so-called \"Friend\", is to a man who is and was one of them. He also created some of the hoax scenarios for the CIA/OSI, involving pseudo-linguistics, ps eudo-archaeology (ala Zecharia h Sitchin), as well as the O.S.I.R.I.S. group used to 'smokescreen' th e cattle mutilation/stealth weapons test program. This archaeology/linguistics brand of government lie has always angered me, because of the tendency to blur and confuse the work of those who are engaged in responsible linguistic inquiry and archaeol ogy, yet which may be vulnerable because they are divergent and out of the mainstream. The flaky and irresponsible fabrication of 'extraterrestrial' interpretations, tends to put a blight on new breakthrough work being done, as if it were also false. For exam ple, around 1977,1 had begun to make headway with petroglyph research indicating connections between American Indians and specific, ancient Middle Eastern, Indo-European, Semi tic, Asian, Norse, and Celtic writings, languages, cultures and peoples, about which I was contemplating a book. I was astounded when the \"Friend\" (whom I had known for several years), paid me a visit in 1977, and announced his intent to institute a program attributing the petroglyphs to \"ancient space aliens\". He was the M.I.B. who had lived in Santa Fe with ALIENS 127"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"and trained the couple of government-paid U.F.O. shamsters known as \"The Two\" in 1972 (Marshall Herff Applewhite and Bonn ie Lu Nettles). He later exploited the mentally disturbed daughter of the inventor of The Formula. I realized at that time, that his fraudulent work was being sponsored by the intelligence community, for whom he had worked for years, and continued to do 'contract work' for. I noticed that, in my presence, he wore a Shriner ring. This was to gain my trust— or better still, to shut me up—on the erroneous assumption that, since CIA files showed I came from a \"Masonic family\", I would feel compelled to \"keep the secrets\". This, in spite of the fact that he was a graduate of a Catholic school (U. of Denver). One of the primary tenets of the Masonic Oath is never to betray a trust. To me, it wasn't my trust he sought, but rather my complicity in a secr et betrayal of the trust of the American people. Even if I had been a Mason, whic h I am not, gaining my trust through such a fraud would have nullified the oath. He erro neously thought that he was 'motivating me at my own level.' It angers me that the intelligence spo oks exploit entire fields of knowledge and professions, sacrificing them to government 'e xpediency', by generating knowingly false programs designed to conceal technology from the public an d to brainwash them in BIG LIE mass-psychology programs ala Hitler. Thes e programs are to subliminally control people by propagating fantastic , ignorant and twisted lies which elevate insane and irrational elements of society, at the expense of knowledge, reason, and truth. It astounded me that the '\"Friend\" could hypocriti cally look me straight in the eye, while my life was all the while being cruelly torn apart by their covert harassment. It occurred to me that a committee had worked this all out on paper somewhere, and that individual rights and human life didn't matter to them, so long as they fabricated the 'right' interpretations of things which helped them to control society. While in graduate school in art at U.T., I was appalled to learn that the fields of art and art history were cynically considered 'e xpendable' to the CIA people, who referred to artists as \"...just a bunch of paranoids ...\". They had permeated both the faculty and the student body of the university art departme nt. To them, the \"cover\" of artists and art historians were ideally suited for deceitful, intelligence-gathering foreign travel, photographing strategic defense areas, picking up and delivering data, acting as couriers, etc., and little else. It was my judgment that the people who do that are no better than the closet homosexuals who marry in order to pres ent a false image of themselves to society as being heterosexuals. There were no less than six CIA professionals on the art faculty at U.T. in 1969, and several CIA and military intelligence operatives posing as art students. I wondered how many operatives they had in other departments of the university. Those who posed as students seem ed to be spies on the students and the faculty. Since the Viet Nam war was in full swing, 'draft counselors' seemed to be among their prime targets, but I suppose that any excuse could have served as a pretext to continually meddle with and control what would otherwise have been a natural, and more just flow of the affairs in a supposedly \"educational\" institution. In the fall of 1977, the Friend made the trip to my home for the specific purpose of dissuading me from publishing this book, and had the gall to lay out the phony hypothesis for HIS book, which he expected me to write. At that time, he had apparently become disturbed not only by my plans for a flying saucer book, but because I had also begun to branch off into petroglyph research , which threatened to interfere with his official Big Lie plan to interpret the petrog lyphs as the \"writings of extraterrestrials\".

This opportunity to prostitute my intellect for cash, included the guarantee that the publishing contacts were already set up and ready to go, in Sedona, Arizona. I hit the ceiling, saying that I had pe rsonal knowledge that flying saucers are man-made, that the government's program of spreading the gospel of E.S.P., Edgar Cayce, and extraterrestrial origin of flying saucers, was a Big Lie originating with the Nazis, and that I would never cooperate in the spreading of such trash. I told him of my broad-daylight sighting, that my parents we re present among more than seven witnesses, and that they had often seen whole squadrons of saucers in the Dakotas. This information on my parent's sightings turn ed out to be a serious mistake, as I underestimated the extremes to which the CI A would go to suppress witnesses. Besides, why argue with someone who already knew the tr uth, and only wanted me to join into the lies to conceal it for fun and profit? He then attempted to intimidate me, and even threatened me, recounting some of the bad things which had happened to some of those who had refuse d to cooperate, or had \"gone too far\" (presumably by doing such things as revealing the secret manipulations I am telling you about in this book). A couple of weeks later, I was visited by my father, who was on his way from the Scottsdale, Arizona, merchandise mart, to Thornton, Colorado, where he and my mother then lived. They ran a lucr ative market-building business in womens' sportswear, providing representation for six Dallas manufac turers and a couple of west coast labels, in around seven or eight states. My father w as a member of the Board of Directors of the Dallas manufacturers' association, my pa rents maintained showrooms in Dallas and Denver, and they had built the markets in Nevada, North and South Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Arizona, New Me xico, and parts of Texas. Fo r ten years, they traveled over 100,000 miles per year, in the \"flying sauc er states\". It was the only visit I can remember in which my father came alone, without my mother. After visiting with my father for a half hour or so, he brought up flying saucers, and to my surprise, urged me to stop telling what I knew about them. Since this was only a few days after the Friend had threatened me, I assumed that my father's visit was somehow connected, another attempt by the CIA to \"shut me up\". To my dismay, my father then denied ever having seen flying saucers, despite the many times that he and my mother had told me about seeing whole sq uadrons of them over such areas as North and South Dakota, and the mountainous count ry near Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado, deep beneath which is the underground N.O.R.A.D. Command Center. This behavior was very unusual, and I wondered how the Friend had manipulated my father's conduct, specula ting that he may have exploite d the \"Masonic connection\", since I had seen a Shriner's ring on his finger. My father is a 32nd degree Mason, and my mother is a highly-esteemed member of the Order of the Easter n Star (the female Masons). For what it's worth, I had been a charter member and officer of the Winkler County chapter of the Order of De Molay (j unior Masons) when I was a boy, but never considered becoming a Mason because I am an Atheist, since I knew that initiates were required to swear a belief in \"Almighty God\".

Austin and Sam Houston, and was a Shriner (the military Masons), and I knew that he would have nothing to do with an evil plan to subvert the constitutional authority of America, or to subjugate any race. Roger had driven an L.S.T. in almost every major invasion in the South Pacific, and had been the world's first radar gunner on the Na vy's \"Black Widow\", in its record-breaking mission over Tokyo, and had proven that he was prepared to make the supreme sacrifice to stop Fascism, fighting bravely for the freedom of the Phillipinos and others. If the Illuminati Fascists worked within the Amer ican Masonic Orders, he apparently knew nothing of it, since he was anti -Fascist, and simply not the kind of man to tolerate such an attitude within himself or among his associates. I wondered how my father had been persuaded or scared into lying, since he is highly opinionated and stubborn, painfully trut hful, and unlikely to change his mind because of what someone else wanted. It was indeed uncharacter istic behavior on his part, which was inexplicable except by th e application of extraordinary pressure, subterfuge, or threats. In dismay, I accused him of cowardice in the face of government intimidation—the kind of feudal extortion that good Masons are supposed to resist—for whatever reason unknown to me at the time. Be cause of that incident, my father and I didn't speak for over five years. I finally forgave him, since he is an elder person. How could I expect him to stand up to these cr eeps? Who knew what kind of threats or powers were invoked by the \"Friend\", to coerce my father? The next evening, in the late fall of 1977, in a local coffee shop, I was invited by a well-known Santa Fe art dealer I knew, to join he and his friends. I brought up the subject of flying saucers, having in mind the \"Friend\", whom we both knew. The dealer had just returned from the Scottsdale market. When I mentioned my father's recent visit there, he said that he had met him, and said that they had seen him talking privately to the \"Friend\" in Scottsdale, only two days earlier, thus confirmi ng contact between the \"Friend\" and my father. The secrecy made the following facts apparent: My \"Friend\" never mentioned knowing my father, and vice-ve rsa. My father (and mother as well) had been intimidated and coerced by the \"Friend\", to stop corroborating my sightings, and to cooperate with his attempts to shut me up. My father had been forbidden to tell me about the extortion, proven by their behavior and the secret contact. Having independently discovered the fact that the \"Friend\"—n amed James (\"Jim\") Parsons, who really isn't my friend—had th reatened my father, I discussed it with a girlfriend, who inadvertently relayed it to Jim, whom she also knew. I had failed to warn her not to discuss the matter with the Jim, which I didn't expect to happen anyway, but it did. Within two weeks, the Dallas manufactu rers, without warning or authority, 'fired' my parents, who had built their markets for ten years. Since my girlfriend had inadvertently told Jim that I knew of his thre ats, he incorrectly assumed that my father had disobeyed him and told me about them, so he arranged for them to be fired, in attempt to 'get to me'.

As I learned from one of their associates, an older man who also ma rketed ready-to-wear, Mafia Don, Joseph (\"Papa Joe\") Bonanno—who, believe it or not, ran a womens' sportswear shop in Tucson—smelled the federal rat, and organi zed a boycott. The other shops in my parents' territory, boycotted the manufacturers, as a protest against this injustice, and their market generally broke down. Poetic justice sometimes comes in strange ways, from unexpected quarters. I have always wondered if the government ever fully compensated Louis and his Dall as associates for their losses, or whether they ever knew why they occurred. If not, the M.I.B.s made suckers out of them too. I have often wondered how much it was worth to the government. I published the following material in my 1993 and 1995 first and second editions, years before the Heaven's Gate cult's suicide at Rancho Santa Fe, California, in March, 1997. Years earlier, I had lear ned from another girl friend—whose name shall remain anonymous—that Jim had intensively traine d \"The Two\" in late 1972 and early 1973, for three months, in a house the threesome shared in Santa Fe. The 1997 mass suicides highlighted Jim's mysterious CIA training of Marshall Herff Applewhite and Bonnie Lu Trusdale Nettles—\"The Two\"—who had immediately founded \"HIM\" (\"Human Individual Metamorphosis\"), and several ot her cult CIA front groups, following Jim's training. I had known since early 1973 that the cult was connected to the CIA, the primary purpose being the concealment of go vernment saucer and cattle mutilations activities. Jim's subsequent c over-up of his associations with the cult leaders in articles published in area newspapers, showed his desire to conceal the CIA's involvement. \"Never run 'til you know you're being chased,\" they say...... Beginning in the '70s, investigative reporters wrote exposes on The Two, documenting their pattern of infiltrating co mmunities—pretending to be previously unassociated transients—then becoming 'ass ociated', after which the members would become 'followers', to be 'convinced' that th ey were descendants of an 'extraterrestrial race', and that it was \"time for a flying saucer to come from outer space to pick them up\" at a designated time and place, and take them back to their 'home planet'. After spreading word of this around the community—for maximum propaganda impact—the group would meet on the appointed evening, dr ive to a certain hill or other landmark, park their cars, then mysteriously 'disappear', leaving their cars behind. The media coverage was orchestrated concerning the strange 'disappearances', along with the usual paranormal and UFO magazines. The abandoned cars, which were indispensable for the sham, were hauled away to local public pounds. The remaining members of the community, and the media's interviews of them, were relied upon to spread word of the mysterious 'departures'. This worked pretty good, until some sm art investigative re porters trailed the members, took down their license plate number s and auto makes, etc., at several hoax sites, and did some comparisons. It turned out that the same \"Two\", and the same \"followers\", driving the same autos, were repeating the same scenario all over the western U.S. The incidents showed the comp liance of local police and authorities, by first impounding, then releasing the cars, to th e 'disappeared' owners, to be used again, with no reports by public offi cials correcting this in the publ ic media or police reports.

All our friends thought that it was mysterious, since the training was so secr etive. At first we thought it might be some sort of kinky sex cult, but everything was clarified later when the couple was identified in 1973 news articles as the leaders of HIM, and later, in 1987, as the leaders of the O.S.I.R.I.S. (\" Outer Space International Research and Investigations Society\") hoax. Having known about Jim's training of the couple in 1972, prior to their hoaxes, the purpose of the hoax was clear to me, especial ly in view of the various inducements, coercions and subterfuges specifically regarded UFOs and \"aliens\", which were applied to me and my parents in 1977, by Jim, the O. S.I./ M.I.B. who had instigated it, to shut me up about flying saucers or to coerce me in to writing propaganda for the CIA. After all, it would have been clear to even an idiot that Jim was doing all in his power in 1977 to force me and others to propagate lies about \"aliens\". When I encountered Jim at the \"50th Annive rsary of the Roswell Incident\", in July, 1997, he was extremely nervous about my presence, afraid I'd blow his cover. When the news hit the papers in late March, 1997, about the \"mass suicide\" of the \"Heaven's Gate Cult\", I figured that the CIA had decided it was time to 'close out' the 24-year-old operation, which hadn't been very productive of significant, new propaganda for years. This was especially so where I had already identified it for the public as a CIA front in my 1993 book. With its members aging, their activities slowing down, they were beginning to look more like a geriatric care group, so what else was to be done with them, since they had been 'p rogrammed' for years and were dependent on the group. The CIA, couldn't have these 'loose cannons' rolling around on the deck, so they were heartlessly 'put to sleep' like tire d old dogs who were no longer of any use to their CIA mind-control masters. With the mass deaths, Jim was nervous. Just as articles he had written for the Santa Fe Reporter in 1975 had lied about his earlier connection to the HIM cult and The Two, the articles he wrote in 1997— four years after my first ed ition—just after the horrible news of the cult's 'suicides', was intended to conceal the guilty knowledge of a nervous CIA propagandist, concerning the many deaths which he had contributed to as the creator or the cult. In an article by Jim in the Albuquerque Journal, of Sunday, April 6, 1997, entitled \"Man Tells of Friend Joining H eaven's Gate\" - \"Santa Fean Saw Cult Lure Friend\", Jim said \"One day in 197 5, I encountered a group called Human Individual Metamorphosis, and showed Gor don a flier for a public lecture the next Saturday.\" Thus Jim had \"showed Gordon\" a flier and begun to 'recruit' Gordon Welch, his roomate, in 1975, into the cult Jim had cr eated, and which was eventually the end of Gordon. Of course he didn't tell Gordon or th e newspapers that he had created the cult. It was clear from Gordon's letters to Jim th at he was a complete dupe, unaware of the fact that Jim and the CIA were behind the cult, and that, to them, he was just a piece of animated meat they had chosen because of his innocent gullibility, who had been programmed to act out stupid fantasies to c onceal flying saucer technology, as well as to provide more propaganda mileage for the CIA, to feed the demented minds of whatever suckers were out there.

Have to work on ge tting all thoughts pure and good and honest and direct. That's a tall order.\" At one point in the article, Jim desc ribed how he had gone with Gordon to Albuquerque to attend a HIM meeting, and a 'reading'. Jim gives us his thoughts: \"Driving back to Santa Fe, I pondered this re ading and decided to reverse my skeptical attitude about flying saucers and HIM.\" At the head of the article, it was stated, \"Authorities say one of the victims from last month's mass suicide in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif, was identified as a Gordon Welch.\" I have to laugh about Jim deciding to \" ..reverse\" his \"skep tical attitude\" about flying saucers and the cult activi ties HE created. Since I me t him in 1972 he had always had this inflexible attitude, especially in the presence of impressionable new-age types.

The CIA/OSI front group he belonged to was named for a deity of the ancient Egyptian religion, \"Osiris...the Beautiful Hare\" 3 . Though the name for the god \"Osiris\" was derived from a folk mythical hare (the Easter Bunny), as shown by references noted in 1886 by Budge in Egyptian Book of the Dead, they remained unnoticed until my 1993 first edition. I had al ready derived this fact from independent research in etymology, in which Osiris, as a hare (\"Heru-\"), was associated with Isis, a duck or goose (\"Khuti\"), who gave birth to Horus (\"Heru-Khuti\"), from the earliest times in western Siberia, in the mythol ogy of the Uralo-Altaic-speaking peoples. The naming of the UFO 'research' group—r un by a CIA/OSI counterintelligence team—after Osiris, shows th e earmarks of the former SS RSHA Gestapo spooks who formed the core of the CIA's Office of Sc ientific Intelligence, Science Directorate, Covert Operations (flying saucer cover-up teams). Movies from '20s and '30s Germany show parades of 'pre-Nazi', Thule Society-s ponsored 'new-agers', in ancient Sumerian and Egyptian costumes, holding ceremonious pagents, propagating the mythology of Ostara, the Nazi religion created by a Ci stenian monk, Adolf Joseph Lanz, founder of the Order of the New Temple in 1900. That same year, at Lambach Abbey in Upper Austria, Lanz initiated the boy, Hitler, into this religion. He then left the order, and under the alias Georg Lanz von Liebenfels, began publishing the Hyperborean and anti- Semitic periodical, Ostara, in 1905. 4 The Ostara religion, as the basis for the Thule gesellschaft, was one and the same as the new religion which I mentioned as being 'revised' for American dissemination, usin g von Liebenfel's manuscripts, by Charles Hundley 5 , as Astara, to be led by the Cheneys. This group is now known as The Ashtar Command, and is also the basis for the script for the TV series, Stargate. It is also the basis for the writings of Zechariah Sitchin, regarding the alleged extraterrestrial origin of the Sumerians, the same kind of stuff whic h Jim tried to hire me to write in 1977. The Egyptian esoterica (\"O.S.I.R.I.S.\", etc.) was used by the CIA to imply involvement of an occult group, or a gr oup of 'extraterrestrials' who practice or originated that religion. This fits in with other parts of the 'puzzle', by saying that the ancient Egyptians were extraterrestrials. The O.S.I, group known as O.S.I.R.I.S., specializes in appearing at th e sites of cattle mutilations, to suggest that the mutilations are occult-related, and to falsely absolv e the Secret Government, according to the \"Puzzle Palace\" tradecraft. We are expected to investigate and to 'discover' that occult groups, practicing the Egyptian religion , are holding \"golden cup\" ceremonies. The Nazi influence in our society exists in many forms, often unrecognizable even by people who should know better, often due to the concealment of the actual nature of the Nazi phenomenon, perhaps through the influence of people like Reinhard Heydrich and Heinrich Mueller of the CIA.

The New Mexico St ate Police \"Knight\" on horseback—copied from the Hitler painting—searches for the \"Hol y Grail\" (the \"Golden Cup\"), which is the Nazi double symbol of \"pure blood\" a nd \"knowledge\". This neo-Templar theme, a fundamental tenet of Nazi SS novices, in their training under Heinrich Himmler at Wewelsburg Castle, seems to ha ve surfaced again in America. A White Sands Missile Range Army Security document, placed in the mailboxes of teachers at the White Sands Missile Range School, where I taught in 1970-71—to 'warn' us about the awesome evils of \"atheism\" and the \"peace sign\"—was evidence of the kind of \"knowledge\" to which the N azi/Christian/Templar \"golden cup\"/\"Holy Grail\" myth refers.

Satan is suppo sed to be an enemy of his father, God. How could he disbelieve his father existed? An Atheist can 't be an \"enemy\" of God, because to an Atheist, God doesn't exist, and you can't be an enemy of something which doesn't exist. Immediately following this oxymoronic \"Army Intelligence\" blunder, an article appeared in Navy Times, which gave a more \"knowledgeable\" history of the iconography of the \"peace sign\" than the one written by Army intelligence Fascists at White Sands, who wanted to equate the p eace sign with \"Satan's little plan\".

Admission into Masonry requires a belief in \"Almighty God\", which comes as a surprise when considered in light of esoter ic mythological informa tion, related to the origins and meanings of the myths of \"The Holy Grail\", \"Lucifer\", and \"Jesus\".

As the myth goes, when Lucifer—also known as the \"Morning Star\"—fell from heaven, a sacred green emerald (the \"sacred st one of El\") fell from his crown. This was the \"Holy Grail\". From it was supposedly car ved a cup known as \"The Holy Grail\", which was searched for by the Nazis 7 in the vicinity of the ancient Pyrenees stronghold of the Albigensians, whom they regarded as their \"ancient Aryan spiritual forebears\". The Albigensians were burned at the stake (the \"Pyre\", hence \"Pyrenees\"), 700 years earlier, by the Catholic church. The Nazi Ahnenerbe defined its mission as being to avenge the ancient wrongs done to th e Hyperborean (\"O-phir-bore-an\", or \"East-Port-Barrow-People\") Cathars (\" Ca-\" + \"-thars\" = \"Quay-Hares\"). The Christian religion was designed by Josephus 8 (A.K.A., General Arius Calpurnius Piso), on behalf of the ruli ng Roman elite—who we re Hermeticists—to replace the old Arrian (Aryan) religion, in which Osiris was the main god. Jesus was created literally as a replacement for Lucifer, to become the \"Messiah\" for the 'new' religion for the \"Age of Pisces\". Since th e (five-pointed) morning star (Venus) which was the symbol for Osiris (Lucifer), was also to be the symbol for Jesus, Josephus made Jesus to be called, \"the bright and morning star\" 9 . That means the Christians worship Lucifer, disguised as Jesus. Th at Lucifer really is a deceiver! It became apparent to me that only the government could have financed and run such an operation, and that only they had th e motive to do so. Only the corporate-state O.S.I. conspirators had almost unlimited funds and financial motivation to invest in such an endeavor. It was indeed astounding that an O.S.I. agent whom I had known for years, had confirmed his connection to the Secret Government, and attempting to recruit and employ me in the fabrication of tacky CI A \"alien\" trash, to hoodwink the American people, by concealing the advanced technology on behalf of the IllumiNazis.

If anyone categorically doubts the feasibility of perpetual motion devices, I would like to introduce you to my real friend, the Universe, which, like an atom with its perpetually orbiting electr ons (as a rule and not an exception), is a perpetual motion machine.

Is this the ultimate Wag the Dog scenario, or what? There is traditionally a quasi-Nazi orientation of state police in America, which is often interlocked with the CIA. In Texas, as a Neighborhood Commissioner for the Boy Scouts in 1962, I attended a scouting executive conference hosted by the Air Force at Big Spring. For some unexplained reason, ev eryone started speaki ng German. Most of the Buffalo Trail executives were of German or Nordic extraction. The keynote address for the conference was to be delivered by the head of the Texas Department of Public Safety, Col. Homer Garrison. Also in attendance was (then Capt., later Col.) Wilson Speir. As I waited in the \"air room\", before Garrison's address, Col. Speir approached me and unexpectedly said, \"Adolf Hitler was the finest Christian gentleman the western world has ever seen, ex cept he made only one mistake, by failing to kill all the Jews.\" After the conference , I was placed on the mailing list of several anti-Semitic, Nazi-oriented publications, such as Conde McGinley's Common Sense, of Union, N.J. I never paid a dime, and the pa per continued to reach me no matter where I moved, until 1966. Many policemen like Speir apparently admire Hi tler because they consider him to have been \"a good cop\", who \"cleaned up the streets of Germany\". Police work sometimes naturally attracts authoritarian types who think that an authoritarian state will diminish crime and improve life. And imagine: A state in which the cops would be \"top dogs\"! These are not good cops. They are \"bad cops\". Another thing this experience confirmed, was the Nazi orientation of the Boy Scouts, similar to the transformation in Germ any of the Pfadtfindern (\"Pathfinders\", the German equivalent of the Boy Scouts), into the Jugendbunds (\"Youth Bunds\"), from which the S.S. Hitlerjugends had grown. In Austin Texas, in 1968, a Boy Scouts of America T.V. ad was narrated by one of Wernher von Braun's N.A.S.A. astronauts, John Glenn, now a U.S. Senator from Ohio (a nd the oldest astronaut to go into space). The ad showed Scouts on patrol, carrying pa trol flags, running up a hill and tumbling down the other side, as a vaguely familia r German military march played in the background. I recollected having heard the march only a short time before, in a televised documentary of William Shirer's Rise and Fa ll of the Third Reich.

Despite the numerous inquiries of Senator 'Babe' Sc hwartz of Galveston, no one could figure out what Speir had supposedly done to earn it. Schwartz probably knew of Speir's Nazi proclivities, and was just 'turning up the heat'. One of the first things Speir did when he took over the D.P.S., was to create the state police's very own \"mini-CIA\". The first thing to come to my mind, was Himmler's S.S..

In 1986, a young Atheist scout was kicked out because of his refusal to believe in a \"god\", or to pledge loyalty to \"God\", as st ated in the \"God and Country\" phrase in the Boy Scout Oath. Asserting his right to religious belief or non-belief, he brought suit to enjoin the scouts to reinstate his membership , alleging not only the un-American, illegal and unconstitutional discrimination against hi m because of his beliefs, but also the abridgement of his 2nd Amendment rights to protection against state recognition of an establishment of religion. He lost the suit and the U.S. Supreme Court upheld what they referred to as the \"right\" of the Boy Scouts of America to discrimi nate against Atheists. A taxpayer-provided federal highway marker on 1-25 to the south of Santa Fe, directs the public to a local Boy Scout meeting hall, as official sponsorship of the Scouts, who discriminate against Atheists, just as they might do against Jews. Ergo, the state officially discriminates against Atheists. It is disturbing to think that these Chri stian fascists equate only their religious beliefs with \"good\", while the beliefs of \"Atheist s\" are automatically associated with \"evil\". Perhaps someone should have told them that \"Satan\", to an Atheist, is purely a mythological creation which belongs to the Ch ristians and Jews. The Communists only pretended to be Atheists, but in reality, substituted a different pantheon of gods (their leadership), under a different set of mystical beliefs, replacing the myth of \"god\" with the myth of \"collective consciousness\", the same as the Tibetan Bonpas. Atheism is inconsistent to totalitaria nism, since Atheists are by definition individualists who rej ect both Christian, Communist, or any other mystical collectivism. Without blind acceptance of what a totalitari an government or religion tells you, based on faith rather than reason—such as the idea of a \"collective consciousness\"—as the basis for a \"more just\", \"more scientific\", or \"superior\" form of government or society, a collectivist system breaks down. There is nothing in the world's major religions to prevent them from practicing communism or fa scism, which are based on the same kind of altruism. In fact, wherever these religi ons have become the \"state\" religions, the results have been communistic or fascistic. Many people like Stalin, merely exchanged their priestly garbs for communist or fasci st uniforms, without even breaking stride. Fidel Castro was converted to Marxist-Leni nism by two Jesuit priests, while in the Sierra Maestas of Cuba, preparing for his final march on Havana. I have found nothing in the lives or work s of such famous Atheist as Giuseppe Verde, Mark Twain, Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla, Nathan Hale, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and many others whom y ou might never suspect, to urge anything other than a free system, including the right to believe as one chooses, upon others.

It is easy to be confused when the government spreads false propaganda among a public willing to believe it. A 1953 panel was set up to \"investigate\" flying saucers, headed by Dr. H.P.

The N.S.A. (parent agency to the O.S.I.) is known in the \"trade\" as \"The Puzzle Palace\" 10 . A 'puzzle' is something that comes in bits and pieces, but \"puzzle palace\" implies a place where puzzles are created, like a \"pizza palace\" creates pizzas. Through \"false puzzles\"—the pieces of which fit togeth er to form false pi ctures—the public is misinformed in such a way that they believe they have pieced a puzzle together, and \"...figured something out\", when in reality they were suckered in by the O.S.I. These \"puzzles\" might lead a rational person to c onclude that the scenarios are too corny to believe, but the religious history of the wo rld shows that 'mass' society is hooked on corny scenarios, especially \"religious\" or \"spi ritual\" ones. O.S.I, think tanks—guided by the S.S. mystics of Reinhard Gehlen's RSHA—have designed these phony 'alien' scenarios, using the principles of secret, mystical movements, societies and religions of the world. This technique was influenced by the fact that, in the creation of librettos for grand opera, composers and librettists know that successful librettos must be \"schmaltzy\" (Yiddish for \"chicken-fatty\", but meaning \"corny\" and overdone). This conclusion influenced the modern Big Lie Technique, as stated by Adolf Hitler: \"In the size of the lie there is always contained a certain factor of credibility, since the great masses of people...will more easily fall victim to a great lie than to a small one, since they themselves...lie sometimes in little things... Thus such an idea of an untruth will not at all enter their heads...therefore, just for this reason, some part of the most impudent lie will remain and stick \".

As I have already said, an Albuquerque scientist named Calvin Horn, among others, years ago found that a standard blood coagulent and a microwave chamber were used to thoroughly exsanguinate the carcasses (even removing traces of copper from the livers). A cauterizing scalpel (invented in 1938, for t hose idiots who are easily mystified by technology as old as I am) removes tissue in non-bleeding cuts, caut erizing as it goes.

It appeared in the ancient Nibelungenlied (\"Song of the Nibelungs\", the pan-Germanic epic), became known as the \"Holy Grail\" myth, and was eventually taken up by both the Christians—who erroneously associated it with their religion—and by the Nazis, via their Ahnenerbe/Thule Societies, within the \"Old Prussian\" Masonic Illuminati, which revived the ceremony in neo-pagan Luciferian/Osirian Nazi S.S. ceremonial to asts to \"knowledge\" and \"pure Aryan blood\". This and the Egyptian Apis Bull myth are more fully connected in Chapter VII. Then came the O.S.I, with its cattle mutilations cover-up, and covertly operated \"O.S.I.R.I.S.\" pseudo-occult front group, to which they psychopolitically imputed responsibility—not to exclude the possibility that the ceremonies are actually those of Nazis perpetuating a secret S.S. infrastruc ture within the CIA—and daring us to catch them.

In 1985, they warmed up the old Roswell leftovers as the \"MJ-12\" hoax, to retroactively fabricate a coverup in 1947. (There was a 1947 cover-up, but that was to conceal the fatal flaws in the hastily bungled initial hoax.)

Using the same material—the dissemination for which S.S. theorists were once hung or shot by the Tribunal at Nuremberg—our own CIA, revealin g its S.S. affinities , subtly brainwashes us with this garbage with impunity, in s ubliminal psychopolitical messages.

In the ancient Egyptian religion, Hapi—one of the four sons of Horus the hawk or falcon—and one of the four kings of the ca rdinal points of the earth—is shown as a baboon-god which is the dual namesake for th e 'Apis' Bull. The bull and ape are both forms of Osiris, the father and son of Horus, as part of early 'holy trinity' myth copied by Josephus. The military intelligence/Ill uminati committees pro ffered up monkies as aliens at Roswell in 1947, using the shaved and dyed rhesus monkies (which are very close to the original \"cyno cephalus\" (\"Chinese-headed\") baboons used by the Ancient Egyptians), to produce alienoid/humanoid-looking beings. An examination of all this stuff makes it ever more maddeningly apparent that BIG BROTHER has been playing games with our minds, planting ancient Egyptian esoterica, either out of inhe rent bureaucratic plagiarism a nd uncreative laziness, or to dare some scholarly investigator to eventually discover it.

The sacred bull was chosen for a white triangle on his forehead, as another maddening Trilateral symbolic parallel! The bull was referred to as \"Osiris Apas\" (in Greek, \"Osorapis\"). Literally, this means \"East-H are-Ape-(Bull)\", a sort of animal/god conglomerate typical of the Egyptian religion.

Furthermore, a handy supply of rhesus monkies from the Regional Primate Research Laboratory, at Alamogordo (or its predecessor agency) were already being killed in the rocket sled accelerator experiments, as substitutes for human pilots, preparatory to manned flights in rocket planes such as the X-15, leading up to the moon missions envisioned by Wernher von Braun. The monkies were already outfitted with the helmets and G-suits, to simulate human conditions as closely as possible. The origin al photos showed pressure lines and lacings visible on the G-suits, which would have been unnecessary had the monkies been pilots of flying saucers, which canceled most if not all of the G-force. The original photos which I saw, now appear to be unavailable, except in the memories of myself and those who saw them. When one of these shaved dead babies is dyed green, and you put his G-suit and helmet on, with those like DEAD eyes looking out from under those droopy eyelids, the effect is EERIE enough to convince some gu llible people that they are \"aliens\". The dead lab animals were shaved, in order for the G-suits to be effective (the pressure with the animal hair would be ineffective). The total effect was in fact TOO WEIRD, and even the government bunglers eventually backed off from that one. The key words here are LAZY and BAD TASTE. The or iginal photos showed the fatal flaws—identifiability of the critters as monkies, and apparently man-made constuming and equipment—since aliens capable of traveling millions of light years through interstellar space, would probably not use conventional sewing machines and lacings to make their garments. Exposure of the 1947 fakery, exposes the ensuing protracted hoaxes. Ergo, the newly created (c. 1985) MJ- 12 documents scenario, ex post facto, was also a hoax. The original hoax at Roswell was already out of the bag and had to be altered, since it was obviously bungle d. A hoax to conceal a bungled hoax. The major error in the original 1947 Roswe ll hoax, after the dead monkies were all dressed up for the rocket sled, was in decidi ng to go ahead and give them \"somewhere (else) to go\", without more professional cons ultation. At that point, some G.I. with bad taste and judgment, probably said something like \"...Yeah...that's it..that's what an alien would look like!

Because of the fantastic electrical flight characteristics and inadeq uate control and navigational systems of the earlier saucers, the government was unable to conceal them while developing them in the area. The hoax was an ill-conceived attempt to explain away the many sightings near the secret military bases, where excited post-war saucer experimentation accompanied the influx of German saucers and personnel, immediately after the war, soon followed by more. The hoax was intended to convince th e many people who had seen saucers, that they weren't \"ours\". The government had its hands full trying to keep the German saucers secret, what with the fifteen thousand German scientific , technical, support and security personnel. All those people had to have recreation, wh ich created even more security problems. The German personnel often went dow n to nearby Juarez and Ojin aga, Mexico, to blow off steam and whoop it up.

Getting foreigners out of Mexican jails has always been difficult, and the Juar ez jail was a sort of old dungeon which was notorious for its large rats and bugs. While at the University of Texas, I had a neighbor named Helen Nash. Helen was married to retired A.F. sergeant George Nash, whose father had gambled away the fortune earned with his grandfather's Na sh Automobile Company. Helen was from Germany. She had an old ancestral castle over in East Germany, near the Czech border, which the West German government bought from her, since they figured sooner or later, the divided Germany would be brought back toge ther again, and they would have 'title'. The old castle would make a fine tourist attraction. Now that's what I call thinking ahead. Helen's father owned all the pleasure boats on the Rhein. His main boat was called the \"Barbarossa\". That made me wonder just how far ahead the Germans were thinking. Anyone out there get that? Barbar ossa (\"Red Beard\") is the Germanic myth about an old man who awakens from his slumber every so often, and comes out of his cave to stalk the earth. The myth is an esoteric Nazi code symbolic of the return of a new Hitler, in a Fourth Reich. At 15 years of age, Helen, who spoke five or six languages, was brought to Alamogordo/White Sands from Bavaria, as a s ecurity agent for the German Operation Paperclip contingency of the secret flying sa ucer/rocket project. One of her main jobs was to negotiate with Mexican authorities, to get German scientists, soldiers, and other personnel out of the Mexican jails, and to act as an interpreter whenever necessary. She was like an extension of the German Embassy, very highly connected because of her aristocratic family. It sometimes cost a lo t of money to get the Germans out of the Mexican jails. Helen never de nied my accusations that the German contingency she worked with included the flying saucer group, but since she still held the rank of major in German Intelligence, she was still bound fr om saying more by security regulations. Helen was brought to White Sands as part of Operation Paperclip, while von Braun was at Ft. Bliss, and the entire German flying saucer project was brought to America, because the Russians were threatening to ove rrun West Germany, and superficially it was feared that they might acquire the te chnology, though it was more likely that the Illuminati was completely eradicating the \"German memory\" of the \"KT-p2\" Projekt. The decision to execute the Roswell hoax was probably not previewed or fully authorized by the Pentagon, failing to anticipa te that their Illumi nati bosses would still be relying upon it 38 years later (in 1985, at th e time of \"MJ-12\"). So the old, flawed hoax was buried, and the new revised MJ-12 ho ax was created to replace it. No one has come up with the photos which were publishe d not only in newspapers, but magazines as well. That means that, in the 47 years since, the spooks have continually combed the shelves and files of libraries, newspapers , magazines and publishers, and \"retrieved\" every last stitch of this evidence, except whatever might still be buried somewhere in someone's old pile of c. 1947-1968 ma gazines, newspapers or other effects.

Recently, information has come to light that William B onny (the \"Kid\"), was not killed by Pat Garrett, but died Dec. 27, 1950 at almost 91 years of age, in Hico, Texas, going by the name O.L (\"Brushy Bill\") Roberts.

They weren't about to let 'revisionists' put an end to a good thing, since a lot of their tourist income and local color is tied up in keeping things the way th ey are.

Jesse James' cousin, Ola Everhard, of Lovingto n, New Mexico, let the cat out of the bag a few years ago, concerning the truth about the death of Jesse James. Among my childhood friends, were the great-grandsons of Frank James, (\"Jimmy\" and \"Al\" Schlosser), and the grandson of a Mr. Shea (\"Seay\", or \"See\"?), Tommy Mulcahy (\"Mulkey\"?). Shea had been in the Army of Northern Virginia. When Lee surrendered, Shea couldn't accept it, and joined Quantill's Raiders in New Mexico. That is where Shea became friends with the James brothers. La ter, Shea rode with Billy the Kid in the Lincoln County Wars, and maintained his old friendship with the James brothers, as well as the Kid, for whom he had a good deal of respect. Shea's respect was not easily won, and I don't think it was completely due to the fact that the Kid (temporarily) used an Irish name, William Bonny. Th at was all explained by Dr. Sonnichsen. I always knew that 'Bonny' and the James brothers (Frank a nd Jesse) had died of natural causes, after living considerably longer lives than most. Frank James, a published historian, ran a profitable antique business at Valley Mills, Texas, near Waco , where he died of old age. His grandson, Jesse James Howard, raised in the Cimmarron, attended the University of Texas in 1938, wearing buckskins , moccasins, beads, and long pigtails. In the '60s, he jokingly boasted that he had been the \"fir st hippy\" at U.T., in 1938. He was Jim and Al's uncle. Mr. Shea and the James boys (who used the names Bounds and Howard) would get together on their favorite patriotic holiday, th e Fourth of July. I remember them getting together 1947, at the Schlosser house across Tornillo street, in Kermit. Shea looked resplendent in his Confederate Uniform, which he wore on such occasions. The get-together was attended by Shea, Fran k and Jesse James, \"Brushy Bill Roberts\" (\"Billy the Kid\"), and their descendants. I can remember playing with a boy named \"Franklin D. Bounds\" (named after F.D.R.), who was Jesse James' great grandson. 11 Tom Lea, The Mustang, University of Texas at El Paso Press [ca. 1961].

That gun had been used in the famous Northfield Minnesota Amnesty Raid. And of course, when we played \"guns\", Jim and Al would play Jesse and Frank, often arguing about which one played Jesse. I remember on that 1947 Fourth of July, that, as Mr. Shea came striding down Tornillo street toward the Schlosser house, a nd I played in the front yard with Al, the three old men with canes—Frank, Jesse, and Bi lly—came in the gate. Al said, \"Hey Bill, how'd you like to meet Jesse James, Fra nk James and Billy the Kid?\" I said, \"Yeah!\", and, as the old men came by, I shook their ha nds, as they said \"H ow-do, young feller\", but Al's sister told his mother, and I was taken into the house and asked to promise to never tell anyone about the 'ghosts' I'd seen. Jimmy and Al got severely reprimanded for telling me \"too much\", since Jesse and Frank may still have had prices on their heads at the time. Though I knew the truth, and was sworn to it, and despite the fact that I tried to cover for them by telling their mother that they had told me nothing, the boys we re still whipped, even though their parents weren't \"mean\". The events of that day told me two things: It was true that Jesse James was still aliv e, and Jim, Al and I weren't good liars. Frank James, whose family used the name Howard (not Jesse's family, as some thought), and Jesse James (whose family used the Bounds name) had been given secret pardons by the 'carpetbag' governor, Edmund Davis, of Texas. They had previously acquired incriminating evidence on a fellow carpetbag governor, Crittenden of Missouri, and blackmailed him into prevailing upon Davis to give them the pardons. The man shot by Bob Ford, in Missouri, was actually a not orious murderer , want ed \"dead or alive\", named Charlie Bigelow, who looked a lot like Jesse. It was he who was laid in the grave, at the \"funeral of Jesse James\", in 1882. James even helped carry Bigelow's coffin, and Bigelow's wife, posing as Jesse's wife, even identified the body for the coroner, as \"Jesse's\"! Unfortunately, Bob Ford was subs equently killed in a Colorado saloon by a James fan. Mr. Shea, over 103 in 1947, died at 104, in 1948. He had taught his grandson, Tommy Mulcahy, at the age of two, to recite every state in the Union and its capitol, as well as the Gettysburg Address and the Declaration of Independence. The old man had a great patriotic love of America, and was one of the few who knew the Civil War was not about slavery. Out of respec t for my friends, I didn't reveal the truth about the James brothers until after thei r deaths. No one would have believed me anyway, and most won't believe me now. Jesse James died of natural causes on August 15, 1951, in Granbury, Texas (on the Brazos River, about 30 miles southwest of Ft. Worth) at age 103 12 . Billy the Kid (A.K.A.

The James brothers had come together on July 4, 1947, to Kermit, to talk over the \"old days\", and to visit family members and their old friend Mr. Shea., and to celebrate Independence Day.

If the government revealed its part in the hoax, or if someone comes along with physical evidence exposing it, the government hoax will be done for, but as for the \"folk festival\", I' m sure some Roswell en trepreneurs will come up with the idea of a \"Great Roswell Alie n Hoax Museum\". After all, why should the Piltdown Man hoax get all the glory? The family of my brother-in-law, Paul E. Jette III, a coach at Mount Pleasant, Texas, were early Anglo settlers in the Roswell area. Paul's great-grandfather was John Blazer, whose mill was the site of a well-known skirmi sh in the Lincoln County War. Some of Paul's family lived at Mescalero, the location of Dr. Robert Goddard's rocket workshop. Paul III and my older sister, Ra mona, took their honeymoon at Blazer's Mill, near Mescalero. Goddard, Willy Ley, and We rnher von Braun fired experimental rockets in 1935-37, from nearby Eden Valley. Paul an d Mona rode to the old Blazer place in a wagon used on the honeymoons of two previous generations of Jettes, as well as by many others in the family. Paul Jette, I (\"Pop\" Jette), married J ohn Blazer's half-Souix daughter, shortly after 1900. He had been the quarterback for the Un iversity of Georgia when Knute Rockne of Notre Dame had thrown the first forward p ass. He set up the first modern athletic programs in New Mexico, at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, and at New Mexico State University (then \"N. M. A. & M. Univ.\", set up with statehood, under Teddy Roosevelt's plan). Then he was the head of the I. N. S.

She had previously been a captured Army nurse at Co rrigidor in the '40s, survived the Bataan Death March, and continued her work as a nu rse at Roswell until becoming a Sister of Charity nun. Roswell researchers have been unable to locate her. I know where she is, but don't want her to be bothered by 'UFOlogi sts'. Her sister, Leona, told me about the rhesus monkies in 1958. The sisters also remembered von Braun and Dr. Robt. Goddard, when they test-fired their rockets at Eden Valley, near Goddard's workshop in Mescalero, in the 1930s. A young unmarried Ge rman baron in his early twenties didn't escape the attention of the girls in the small town of Mescalero, of course! Roswell hoax dupes said the 'aliens' had no teeth, only four fingers on each hand, had \"suction cups\" on their fingertips, and we re \"...not human\". Their teeth had been removed because military personnel were be ing bitten while shaving them, and putting the tight-fitting G-suits on them. Their finger tips were nipped off, healing to suction cup-type configurations. Their ears were surgically removed so the space helmets would fit, and they were deafened because the roar of the rocket sled drove them crazy. Their thumbs were surgically removed to keep them from escaping from the rocket sled harnesses, or from ripping or grabbing at pers onnel. The little guys were usually crushed to death by G-forces in repeat ed rocket sled runs, or in one of von Braun's reworked V-2s, during tests determining the \"G S \" a human pilot might withstand. The strength of these monkies are several times that of humans for their size. (I know about that, since I have a scar on my ri ght hand, slashed at lightening speed by a rhesus monkey at a circus. The nasty cut w as difficult to heal, because of infection caused by the filthy nails of the monkey). The reports that the monkies \"weren't human\", was absolutely correct, since rh esus monkies are East Indian short-tailed monkeys, not humans. There was a switch fr om the more problematic rhesus monkies, to easier to manage and more docile chim panzees, around 1952, about the time of the first publicized rocket rides of the chimps. Following my July, 1993 first edition, the general excitement created by UFOlogy groups and their begged question that the gove rnment \"concealed evidence of the crash of an alien space ship at Roswell in 1947\", Kevin Randle and Don Schmitt published yet another book, The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell, in 1994. At page 149, they state: \"Even Schaffner admits that earliest launches of rhesus monkeys occurred in the early '50s. He found no evidence that monkeys had been used in 1947.\" According to their own documentation, the records of the Space Center in Alamogordo say the first use of monkies in rocket launches was on J une 11, 1948. Was this \"...the early '50s\"? And, these were records of \"rocket\" launch es, not the rocket sled, which naturally preceded the flights of the monkies in rockets, in 1948. G-suits, helmets, face masks and oxygen s upplies were required on the rocket sled for the monkeys, to replicate contemplated human conditions as closely as possible. In addition, acceleration on the rocket sled woul d take away their breath, and if the monkies had died of anything except G-forces, the test s would have been useless. (Incidentally, my Albuquerque friend, Merill Holste, in vented the G-suit in the '40s, but the government stole it from him and pretended that a man connected to a large corporation had invented it.) Of course, if records coul d prove that the \"aliens\" at Roswell were rhesus monkies, they would naturally be classified, since they could document the hoax, like my photos. I also remember seeing a film on the 1947 rocket sled tests using them, simple as that.

I was the one who had raised the issue of rhesus monkies, which was then dist orted with the reference to a possible rocket crash. True to CIA form, they didn't adve rtise my book by mentioning it, because the CIA UFOlogists will only cite 'documen tation' they created and control, but Randle and Schmitt looked kind of silly a ttempting to answer my assertion without citing its source. They got their facts wrong on the rockets too, because V-2s and other German rockets were tested from May, 1946 until 1952, at White Sands Missile Range, by von Braun and company. Highly publicized books by OSI contractor s shows the systematic evasion of my questions, and a persistent asking of the wr ong questions. They fall into two irrational groups: (1) The group asserting an alien spacec raft crash; and (2) the group denying an alien spacecraft crash, but asserting an experimental weather balloon cr ash, and adding that UFOlogists are crazy because they believe in \"alien UFOs\". The UFOlogists have intentionally made it easy for the OSI ps eudo-skeptics, by providing them with assertions and questions which make a de nial look correct, ex cept for the weather balloon lie, used to cover the initially bungled rhesus monkey hoax. The Roswell hoax illustrates how our government went into a relatively remote area—such as the southwest was in 1947—and intimidated and slandered the credibilities of lit erally thousands of people, with lies that those who had seen saucers were liars, were crazy, were publicity-seekers, or were all those things. Rather than to endure ridicule, most people learned to pret end that they saw nothing, and that the sky was 'off limits' to one's credibility. To he ll with Aristotle! Plato's 'Cave Analogy' was now \"official U.S. government epistemology\". Not to diminish the importance of understanding the hoaxes concealing the saucers, there appears to have been other monkey bus iness afoot at nearby White Sands Proving Grounds, under the \"sp ace program\" being hyped by von Brau n, as a propaganda tool to get funding for the rocket and the secret saucer projects. It is a little embarrassing to think that the rocket program is a part of the BIG LIE scheme, since the saucer technology is so much cheaper, durable, faster, and much more fantastic. In retrospect, the rocket program appears to have always b een a mask for the flyi ng saucer stuff, and a much more monstrous and expensive hoax than the Roswell hoax, having as its purpose the enrichment of the chemical and 'aerospace' corporations, to get their impetus behind the program, as well as to enlist their ba cking in the concealment of the saucer technology, thereby also fraudulently enriching the oil and automobile companies, and adding their impetus to the program. To para phrase Hitler, \"The State and industry are to be partners; one hand washes the other.\" 14 In 1970, I met a newspaper wr iter at the Odessa Amer ican, in Odessa, Texas, where my sister Liz had once been the am usements editor. The writer's name was something like John Behmer. He had worked for several newspapers in New Mexico over the years. Since my reporter girlfriend had told him that I was interested in flying saucers, he told me that if I would come in, he would give me some old photos he had found knocking around in a dusty old file draw er of a southwestern newspaper, possibly 14 Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf. ALIENS 155"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"in Lovington, New Mexico. The photos were th e ones I mentioned which had been sent out to newspapers in the southwestern regi on by Walter Haut, the \"P.I.O.\" involved in the Roswell Hoax. One of the photos showed th ree of the dead rhesus monkies in their little G-suits and helmets, and the other phot o showed the junky little fake saucer. The saucer was so small, the monkies would barely have fitted into it, with barely room for one of them under the little plast ic bubble canopy on its top. It was smaller even than the \"Vril\" types purportedly built by the Germans. Behmer said I should be careful who I showed the photos to, since the security people had very thoroughly attempted to retrieve all of them immediately after the initial hoax, in most cases before they were published. Somehow, the two old 8\" x 10\" black and white 'glossies' had survived the purge, forgotten about until Behmer had stumbled across them among old papers in the bottom of the dusty old file drawer he was cleaning out, in a back room of one of the small weekly papers owned by the \"Freedom Chain\", which also owned the Odessa American. A lthough I had seen the photos published, along with a third one, in the distant past, and even had a magazine in my collection which had them in it, my examination of those actual, clear and full-sized photos, allowed me to corroborate the rumor that the \"aliens\" were in fact shaved rhesus monkies, just as I had heard. Unfortunately, I haven't seen the photos or the magazine since 1974, taken by the CIA thief woman who was associated with Jim Parsons (the \"M.I.B.\"), and who had also lived with th e French CIA \"UFOlogist\", Jacques Vallee, for two years. In 1980,1 found books in her pe rsonal library in her apartment in Santa Fe, which were stolen in 1974, along with th e photos and the magazine, before I even knew her personally. It was obvious that she took the unrelated books for her private collection, while collecting the important sau cer conspiracy evidence, such as the photos and my magazine, for the government. When I caught her with the books, she said \"...ohh, don't you remember giving those to me?\" I answered, \"I couldn't have given them to you before I knew you, now could I?\" As an artist, I have been known for my ability to draw accurately from memory. I used to do many of my paintings that way, wh en I was in Austin. I did a series of large \"genre\" paintings (with 'ordinary' people in them), usually based on the Austin environs. I would often 'borrow' the face of so meone I knew, if it seemed to fit well into the character in a painting. In fact, some of the faces I borrowed were those of some of my professors, usually in jest, in satire, or sometimes worse. One of my large paintings was about 5' x 7', entitled \"Winos at 6th a nd Red River Streets\". As one man exclaimed when he saw it, \"Hey! I knows dat dude! He's da' one whut sells dem fishin' baits down by da' river, ain't he!\" One of my professors was a little startled to find his face on one of the winos who was just rounding a corner to join his friends, with a bottle in a sack under his arm. Using my old skills, I will attempt to reconstruct the two photos. Rulers of a corporate-state society perpetrate as many confusing controversies as possible, so that individual members of the public will become so frustrated to attempting to do their own thinking, that they will finally give up and accept the state's Big Lies, spoon-fed to them through a controlled media.

The rivets, screws, and stock aluminum parts were obvious. It was clear from the environments in which the 'saucer' and the 'aliens' were photographed, that the photos had been made before the 'crash scene' had been 'discovered'.) The Intelligence personnel who created the hoax, were prohibited from disclosing classified information. Since th e secret saucers they used on the bases at Ft. Bliss, White Sands and Holloman, were classified, they could not use one of them as an \"alien\" saucer. The fake saucer created for the hoax, was apparently the product of amateur metal workers, because the base where it was fa bricated did not have a competent design or fabrication facility at the time. It was a pathetic failure, because, had it been an \"alien saucer\", created by an advanced civilization, capabable of producing advanced technology capable of coming from light years away, it would have been even more advanced than the German saucers or early American prototypes possessed at the area's secret bases. This early incursion into the special effect s, prop-building and hoax-creation, by the \"national security\" spooks, was apparently a bi tter lesson, which eventually led to them getting \"professional help\" from the movie industry labor pool. They not only produce much better hoaxes today, but have highly advanced cloaking and 'stealth' devices to conceal the saucers, such as special, color-changing surfaces, combined with color and image sensors, which make the saucers look like the background they happen to be hovering or flying in, similar to a chamelion.

A vast quantity of misrepresented or fabricated \"documented sightings\" is th e province of the Big Liars and their dupes, while the real sightings are concealed or ignored. Project Blue Book has already buried more good information than I could ever uncover, or need for that matter, and chasing after such material would keep me busier than a one-legged Indian trying to stamp out a grass fire, just as they intend. The sighting I made in 1953 was the only one I needed, to absolutely confirm the existence of saucers in reality. In order for you to separate truth from lie, it is necessary to discern a predominant pattern exhibited by government \"truth saboteurs\", consisting of the following repetitive strategies: 1. Witness statements which are exaggerated, misstated, falsified, or obliterated; depicting witnesses as ridiculous, seeing th ings like \"...little green men\", or a saucer \"two miles long\", generally portraying them as \"nuts\", drunks, drugged, or hallucinating; this trick is contrite and easy to spot; 2. overstatement, misstatement, or entire fabrication of impor tant physical data, such as a saucer which \"...had fire shooting out all over it, with a strong smell of sulfur\", or which was \"transparent\", \"appea red and disappeared\"; this creates confusion about how the saucer works, and fits in with \"extraterrestrial origin\" baloney, or alleged \"'hallucinations\", \"fantasies \", \"lies\", or \"mirages\"; 3. use of false, government-paid or procur ed witnesses, made to appear as private citizens, often thrown in when an important sighting is made, to confuse the public about what was seen, especially where an articulate witness manages to register a clear statement regarding what he or she actually sa w. This pits one witn ess against the other, in a \"war of credibility\" which nobody wins, and \"neutralizes\" the tr uth. The press often has little alternative but to re peat false, conflicting reports along with whatever true ones there may be, or to print none at all; 4. use of government \"experts\", high-ranki ng military know-it-alls, or so-called \"scientific\" witnesses, often interjected to po se as the 'last word' on a sighting. This attacks the truth, by attempting to impress the reader with the 'high credentials' of witnesses who in fact saw nothing, for the be nefit of dupes who are still too ignorant to realize that the government lost its credibility long ago, and that high-ranking ex-military 'experts' rarely buck the system and are liars, even when, as 'part of the plan', they may pretend to be doing so; 5. tampering in commercial film processing labs, which are easy prey for CIA thieves and saboteurs, as I learned long ago; you only get what they want you to have. The citizen who sends film exposures of saucers to such labs, will probably end up with blank, foggy, damaged, too-dark, tampered, substituted, or entirely missing images, the film may be stolen from one's camera, even be fore an attempt is made to remove it for processing (as in the case of the first roll of film I used to photograph Vicki Landrum ALIENS159"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"and her radiation burns, along with photos of my Peiltochterkompass and other flying saucer equipment). My first photos of Vicki clear ly showed the burns on her arms and legs. These were stolen from my camera by an expert, in Santa Fe, from my camera as it lay in my car, just after my return from Texas. I had to use surreptitious means to obtain replacement photos, and it was necessary to circumvent ad verse influences of some of the members of my own family, who were being manipulated by the CIA, via the Masonic Order and U.S. Army Intelligence operatives. Such people may be caught in a conflict between obeying request from (what they think is) the Masonic Order, and con cern for the life or well-being of a family member or close friend. Witnesses are often astounded at what the media reports as th eir statements, but have no chance to correct these intentional distortions or errors, and usually fail to understand the subtle nuances or scientific reasons for such misrepresented details. Most witnesses are \"little fellahs\", whose 'day in history' may be transfixed by that one sensational, electric event. If it is made to seem fantastic at the outset, who is going to believe their attempts to correct the distortions? VICKI LANDRUM, ET. AL. An example of the 'little fellah' premise I laid out in Chapter I, Vicki Landrum is a persistent, consistent, sticker to the truth. I first heard of her story around 1989 or 1990, near the time of a hearing on her incident, in Washington, D.C. The news report I heard was made around nine years after the incident occurred. The incident stuck in my mind, not only because I have so many relatives in the area where it occurred, but because I had good reason to believe there was a better, truer, story underneath the usual distortions. Some trustworthy relatives had confirmed that it was 'real'. In fact, the government would be hard pressed to cover a ll the relatives and othe r reliable contacts I could martial in that area. At the time I cont acted her, Vicki Landrum resided only a few hundred yards from my sister's house, and the saucer entourage passed through areas peopled by some of my other relatives. So , despite the phony version of the incident which I had recently seen on the \"Unsolved Mysteries\" T.V. program, I retraced prior investigators, and determined the purpose of their lies. I sought out Vicki Landrum in late 1992, and had some trouble finding her, even with the assistance of some of her family members, including her granddaughter. Army Intelligence had already sent a man to check me out at my sister's house, even before I decided to contact Vicki. Once located, th e situation I found was not a pleasing one. If Vicki Landrum was a \"sensation-seeker\" who persisted in her story for profit, as rumors had it, she certainly hadn't done a very good job of it. It was easy to spread local rumors, intended to taint Vicki's credibility or mo tives, or damage her economic standing in the community, and I found her to be a good woman, not so different from many of the people in my own family. Her health—a nd wealth—had been damaged by her own government, which had subsequently misrepre sented and flaunted its irresponsibility, and trashed Vicki's dignity. There was very little if any accurate information published on Vicki Landrum before this book in 1993, after which OSI writers and film makers quickly glommed onto her, to obliterate what I said, with more falsified or distorted descriptions of the ALIENS 160"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"event. Since that time, Vicki has stuck to the truth and refused to lie like they want her to ....to say she saw ' little green men', \"was abducted\", or \"suffered time loss\". Because of this book—the first to expose the Big Lie Mind Control scheme to conceal saucer secrets—the Secret Government has had to rethink its strategy. They can't get around the Landrum/Cash sighting, because it was co rroborated by so many other witnesses, and because the victims suffer ed real physical damage, and most of all, because Vicki hasn't played their game. The place where Vicki lived was not a fashio nable neighborhood, even for the area. It was a somewhat run-down apartment comple x, the main office of which was gutted by fire. Some of the people there appeared to be of the borderline (if not actual) criminal type, and it was not a place for the faint of he art or weak of stomach. Neglected, dirty, ill-clothed children wandered about, as some of their parents sat in dingy and darkened apartments. After finding the burned-out sh ell of the office, I managed to locate the substitute office. I found Vicki only becau se I have conditioned myself to question everything. Everyone, including the manager, said she didn't live there, so I found her next door to a man who said she didn't live th ere and he'd never heard of her. Vicki's family was nice, clean, and quiet, out of place in the complex. The apartment was well lit and friendly, with family members cozily ga thered about a table, engrossed in a board game. Vicki was a little guarded at first, but soon warmed up to me, because we had some common friends, including one of my old stump-jumping buddies, Richard. She was originally from nearby Louisiana, and was typical of many of her generation, having only a high school education, and a necessity to earn a living as a wage earner. Her fine looking husband was in his retirement years, having worked in harvesting and fishing for many years, and was still working. In 1980, Vicki Landrum and her grandson , Colby Lee Landrum (then five years old), and Vicki's friend and em ployer, Betty Cash, were dr iving at night down a state highway in Betty's car, near Huffman, Te xas, after leaving the store where Betty employed Vicki. They had the distinct mi sfortune of encountering a malfunctioning flying saucer, limping along just above gr ound, and accompanied by 24 U.S. Army Chinook helicopters, two by tw o, each sweeping the surrounding pathways with blinding searchlights, looking for poten tial witnesses and obstructions. The route through which the crippled saucer and entourage was moving, was a swampy, heavily forested, non-residential one, apparently chosen as the most clandestine route under the circumstances, en route to Louisiana, probably back to a base for repairs. The Chinook helicopters—the large ones with twin rotors—were probably present in case the saucer should have to be \"freight-'coptered\" back to the base in a harness, in the event it became completely disabled, or may have carried troop s necessary to cordon off and secure the area, in case it crashed. The idea also seemed to have been that, with so much commotion created by the 24 helicopters, with blinding search lights and blasting air, in the dark of night, who would notice the saucer? Electrical energy leakage from the saucer's lower section enflamed the air as it arced to the ground. The helicopter engine roar, prop blasts, and blowing leaves were confusing, deafening and tumultuous, and th e lights, flames and radiation created an eerie, frightening, dangerous, and disorienting effect, as the saucer landed on the narrow black-topped roadway, just in front of th e car. Vicki grabbed her grandson and bolted from the car, only to be forced back by conditions outside which were even worse. In the few seconds that Vicki and five-year-old Co lby Lee were outside, the metal of the car ALIENS 161"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"had heated to a sizzling temperature. As Vicki reached for the door handle, her hand was burned. She then use a part of her plastic jacket to open the door, and it was melted. She still had the damaged jacket when I interviewed her. Vicki's hand print was still burned into the dashboard of the car, where she touc hed it inside. Only microwaves or electrical induction could have heated the car so rapidl y and only penetrating radiation, such as ultraviolet, gamma or X-ray, could have caused the radiation sickness and resultant hair loss suffered by all parties, including Betty Cash, who didn't even leave the car. The following photo was taken to replace those stolen from me, showing Vicki Landrum and her burns: Vicki, Colby Lee and Betty all experience d microwave (infra-red) radiation burns over their entire bodies. The electrical dischar ges, which ignited the oxygen and nitrogen in the air, were probably responsible for sec ondary radiation in the form of ultraviolet or X-rays, which caused them all the total lo ss of body hair. Little Colby Lee—probably due to his tender age—suffered more severe radi ation sickness, and had to endure a great deal of embarrassment and inconvenienc e, having to wear diapers throughout his elementary and most of his junior high sc hool years, due to the acute and continuous diarrhea he suffered as a symptom of radi ation sickness. The radi ation burns on Vicki's body are still plainly visible. Colby Lee's diarrhea eventually subsided. At 19 he graduated from Dayton High School. They will suffer for the rest of their lives. The 24 helicopters were corroborated by a Dayton policeman, a Mr. Walker, who, at the time of the incident, was near Cros by, Texas, where he witnessed the same passing convoy. Vicki has always maintained that she saw a govern ment flying saucer and other aircraft, involved in an \"...expe riment which had gone wrong\", damaging the three of them. Vicki was directly threatened by F.B.I. agents, and a Pentagon official, a Colonel George C. Sarran, who threatened Vicki, first in Wa shington, D.C., and later by phone, telling her to \"...shut up or else...\", with the further th reat that unless she did shut up, she would be unable to earn a decent livi ng again. (This same threat has often been used and enforced by our secret government against others, including myself.) The only 'official' person to 'appear' to lend any aid, was John Schussler, of N.A.S.A, in nearby Pasadena.

Texas senators Lloyd Bentsen and the late John Tower, managed to refer Vicki and Colby Lee for treatment at the Scott-White veterans' hospital in Temple, Texas, but they were so rudely mistreated there, that they were forced to leave. In 1985, Betty, Vicki and Colby Lee filed suit for damages. My facsimile clipping follows: U.S. District Judge Ross Sterling (coinc identally, my distant cousin) dismissed the suit with the right to refile, and I believe it was refiled, and on last report, was still pending. Vicki's attorney, Clyde Ford, Jr., is married to my third cousin, though this fact does not necessarily mean I e ndorse him, though it seems th at his work here has been commendable. He is a former professional with Convair, Atlas Missiles, and General Dynamics, an excellent background for a plaintiffs' attorney in this suit.

In 1989, hearings on the incident were scheduled in Washington, D.C. Vicki, on their request, went to Washington for the hearings, at her own expense. There was only one brief hearing session, at which the government admitted that the operation was one of their 'experiments which had gone wr ong'. All the remaining hearings were postponed and finally cancelled, as Vicki waited in Washington until completely broke, after which she returned home. Based on my talk with Vicki, and Vicki's description and drawing, the saucer had a dulled, darkened, metallic surface (indicativ e of stealth technology), and was shaped rather like what Vicki describ ed as an \"ice cream cup sh ape\" or \"diamond\" shape. Vicki's drawing, made on my request, placed alongside the same type saucer shown in some reliable photos, follows: The use of Army Chinooks, when Air Forc e, Marine, and Naval aircraft were available in the area, suggests the \"city water-tower-sized\" ship was an Army or Special Forces troop-carrier, battle 'saucer, or ground weapons control ship. The air was inflamed by electrical discharges which, because the saucer was apparently malfunctioning, were being em itted from the bottom of th e limping saucer, each time the pilot attempted power up to become airborne. The discharge 'leakage' about the bottom, which arced to the ground via Vicki and co mpany—probably attracted by the metallic car—drained the energy required to maintain 'buoyancy', grounding and draining the electrical activity necessary to compress th e ether carriers and bl ock the gravitational effect on the bottom, to maintain proper flight of the already crippled saucer. The ship was probably experiencing internal dielectric breakdown of essential electrical components. The presence of the car in close proximity to its path, at the time it was crossing above the road, only made matters worse, by forcing the saucer to make a landing on the road, until the car was moved away from it so it could take off again. Under the circumstances, the pilot could no t fly more than a few feet above ground, since further internal damage or a sudden loss of power at a higher altitude might have caused the saucer to smash into the ground with sufficient impact to destroy it and its ALIENS 164"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"crew.

These \"lights\" (actually emission electrodes) were activated in sequence, one after the other, in one direction around the ship, creating the illusion of rotation. These reddish pulses of current neutralize the \"precession problem\" I mentioned in the Introduction, by creating a rotation of counter active force in diametric opposition to the precessive force, thus stabilizing a ship so the pilot has a steady view of the outside. The government's covert Ufology lunatic fringe contingency tried to discredit the sighting for the benefit of their pseudo-skeptic counterpart, with the silly lie that the ship was an \"alien flying saucer\" being escorted to a \"meeting between aliens and our leaders\". (BIG LIE RULE NO. 1: MAKE THE LIE BIG ENOUGH). Such scenarios are often accompanied by fabricated environmentali stic bullshit, such as a desire by \"aliens\" to \"bring us Earthlings to our senses\", etc ., because our \"misuse of technology threatens the whole universe\". Give us a break! If the entire earth or solar system were to suddenly vaporize itself in a thorough and complete nuc lear explosion, the total effect would be less than that of a flea farting in a tornado. It is also interesting to note that Whitley Strieber, in his books, or Budd Hopkins, in books such as \"Intruders\", never mentione d Vicki Landrum, et. al., even though Landrum said they had interviewed her. She said she adamantly refused to say \"...what they wanted me to\"—that she'd seen \"aliens\", been \"abducted\", or \"suffered time-loss\"—and instead continued to insist that what she saw were \"government aircraft\", (including the saucer) and nothing more. This was apparently the reason she was threatened, slandered, and never compensated for her health damage and losses, by our wonderful government. It is obvious as to how most witnesses are induced to say what their interviewers want them to, but not Vicki, a tough little lady who deserves respect. RADIATION DANGERS Regarding Vicki Landrum's radiation burns , the \"flames\" described by Vicki are 100% consistent with what Tesla descri bed, as he developed this technology, 15 as follows: \"THE FIRST PROBLEM: HOW TO INCREASE THE HUMAN MASS - THE BURNING OF ATMOSPHERIC NITROGEN: \"...The flame grew larger and larger, and its oxidizing acti on more and more intense.

ALIENS 165"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"I should also point out that the public is grossly malinformed and misinformed regarding potentially \"danger ous radiation\". I suffered seri ous radiation damage after my 13th year, so I speak with some experience. In spite of the fact that I am 6' 3\" tall, my growth was stunted in my lower legs by perhaps 4\", by radiation. Sound crazy? Read on. In 1951, in my 13th year, my father wanted me to take an \"uptown job\", outside our own business (which I sometimes ran when my family was absent). He wanted me to meet the rest of the \"business community\" in our town at large, beyond the confines of our own business sphere. That was the year my 'growth spurt' occurred. I got a job at a Dunlaps Department Store a few blocks away, sweeping up the store. During rest breaks, I would often go to the shoe departme nt, where I would stick my feet into an X-ray machine used to check out shoe fits in vitro, studying the bones of my feet and toes. The machine was called a \"fluoroscope\", which used 'soft' radiation, tuned to cause the bones to fluoresce, and to produce an image on the screen, as one viewed his or her feet. During the time I did this, I apparently absorbed dangerous levels of radiation, which, as should be emphasized, were of the so-called 'harmless, softer' variety (i.e., below the frequency of \"hard\" X-rays, but above the general frequency of ultraviolet rays). Unbeknownst to me, the radiation was killing and mutating the red blood cell production tissue in the marrow of the bones of my feet and lower legs (remember what I said about the transmuta tion of elements below Atomic No. 19—such as calcium—in U.V. light?). I soon began to experience so much pain in my feet and legs, that I had to quit the job. I lost weeks of school, laying in bed wi th strange fevers and leg and foot pain. I became anemic, had nosebleeds, and experienced several other related symptoms. The only explanatory diagnosis by local doctors for my mysterious symptoms, was \"growing pains\". I had to drop athletics for a year. My time in the 100 yard dash increased from 11 to 15 seconds. My lower legs became \"bird-like\", the objects of ridicule, as I struggled through my upper body, to make my sluggish legs move faster. My upper body continued to develop, making the dispr oportionate lower legs look even stranger. There was no medical connection made at the time by my doctor, as we were unaware that the machine at Dunlaps had caused my life-threatening symptoms. I still have problems from it, and have had discoloration around my feet and lower legs since my 13th year. Though available to any kid or other person who happened to wander into the department store, the radiation was a da ngerous, public hazard. Powerful cosmic radiation of very high frequency (the ZPR) pe netrates our bodies all the time, passing even through the thickest lead. It passes clear through the earth without incident. Its frequencies are so high and wavelengths so small as to pass between the tightest of spaces within and between the atoms of even the densest of matter. It is when the wavelengths correspond to the resonant frequencies of our bodily atoms, that dangerous reactions occur. Relatively low frequency posi tive radiation of lowe st energy, penetrates the clothing and flesh, and r eacts with the calcium in our bones. The bone marrow in the lower body, in children, produces much of the red blood cells needed to maintain healthy life. As a child matures, th ese lower bones eventually stop producing blood cells, after which the bone marrow in the upper body cont inues to produce blood cells. At the time I was exposed to the Dunlaps fluoroscope, my body was already in transition to ALIENS 166"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"produced in my lower legs. I came very near to dying shortly after th e incident. As best I could determine, I crossed the danger line of 'radioactive relaxation', in 1977, 26 years following my exposure. This period varies acco rding to the radiation involved, in respect to the particular matter excited by it, so this was just an educated guess. Ordinary matter which has been 'excited ' by powerful ionizing radiation, may show no detectable outward signs that it can 'relax' at some future date, to produce 'synthetic radioactivity' which is harmful to anyone near it. This is one of the reasons the F.B.I. conceals a book I mention below, and Los Alamos refuses to sell lead which has been used for radioactiv e shielding, along with the fact that lead shielding may contain some radium atoms (as well as gold) into which some atoms may have been transmuted, by absorption of high energy radiation, during experi ments. Since radium emits gamma rays and produces alpha part icles of around 4.5 Mev (\"million electron volts\"), the lead could be very dangerous. Before 1892, a Frenchman named Gustav e Le Bon wrote a book on \"synthetic radioactivity\" 16 . This book related to the use of or dinary, non-radioactive elements, to create nuclear reactions, thus opening the way for safe nuclear power generators. The book was among those on the F.B.I.'s 'retrieval list', in it s 1942 sweep through all U.S. public libraries, book stores, universities, a nd even private collections and libraries. A copy of the book formerly used by and availa ble to Dr. T. Henry Moray, in his local Utah public library, was confis cated by the F.B.I. in 1942. In 1943, when Moray was attempting to reco nstruct his radiant energy generator of the 1920's (the 50 kw one), he sought the book at the library, and was subjected to F.B.I. threats. Nonetheless, Moray was able to surreptitiously procure three copies of the book from a friend who was a book dealer, for his private library. Le Bon's book related to techniques 'redis covered' by me in the 1970s, as well as to the kind of radiation which almost en ded my boyhood life for no apparent reason. Similarly, particle beam devi ces employing ultraviolet lase r concepts, in the hands of Secret Government CIA maniacs, are in my estimation the basis for \"stealth murder weapons\" being tested on cattle, for which the 'mutilations' are their removal of tissue from the cattle to test for organic damage effects. Such weapons, tuned to U.V. frequencies, will disable a victim's T4 immune cells, can cause death by \"terminal pneumonia\", other related organic failures, cancer (by destroying pl6 and p53 oncogenes), or tuberculosis 17 . This can also be called \"A.I.D.S.\" or \"hantavirus\", since all these victims—including cancer victims treated with chemotherapy—once their T4 immune cell count drops below 250, will di e of terminal pneumonia, brought on by \"M.A.I.\" (Microbacterium Arium Intercellulare), the ordinary 'soil bacteria' we all carry in our systems. In healthy persons, these M.A.I, seek out and destroy cancer cells five times as fast as any known anti-cancer drug. 18 Despite government misuse, \"syntheti c radiation\" reactors—electric power generators using elements of low atomic number—are safer than any known means of 16 Gustave Le Bon, The Evolution of Matter, publisher unknown [ca. 1890]. 17 Announcement by scientists, M.

My conclusions, based partly on my study of Blokhin's book (see bibliography), were further confirmed by my contact with an unnamed Mormon who experimented with and manufactured power generators based on Moray's generators. Unfortunately, Moray's theory and description of his radiant energy invention can't be trusted, as he apparently didn't know how it worked. In addition, he often used fake diagrams to conceal his work from prying government snoops, and the diagrams and drawings available do not pr ovide so good an idea as my drawings do. Some of my designs combined ideas of Te sla and Moray, with some of my own. I conceived most of them independently, before I ever heard of Moray, whose plans bear no similarity to mine. I will give all these plans to the public in other books. Though I created an \"on-sale bar\" for my universal rotary power transmission (Appendix A), by offering it for sale to th e Japanese public in a 1991 newspaper ad, the appendix clearly bars anyone from patenting it. My introduction to the 'unnamed Mormon' was mysteriously arranged by a man who sought revenge against the Illuminati, afte r they had arranged for him to be falsely accused, tried, convicted, and sent to federa l prison for several years, for alleged S.E.C. violations, following the discovery by he and his friends of an ancient, revolutionary and simple piece of mining equipment, calle d the \"Clute Machine\", which had once threatened the Illuminati monopoly on preci ous and 'strategic' metals production and banking, many years before. After finding the old machine sealed away inside an abandoned Colorado mine tunnel, the group restored it to working condition. After news of their discovery leaked out to the Illumi nati, the group was then Judas-goated into a criminally conceived and orchestrated federal entrapment scheme, in volving the use of a federal con-man who wormed his way into thei r confidence. I will reveal the details of this simple machine in another book. It is already \"public domain\". The typical coercive suppression of m onopoly-threatening technology by the Illuminati, is carried out mostly under federal S.E.C. regulations, through judicial abuse which is seemingly unrelated to the technology it is used to suppress. When you think about it, this is practically the only convenient way for them to do so, other than outright brutal murder, which lacks the 'cover' provide d by \"color of law\", though murder is at least more criminally honest and complete. THE U.F.O. CLEANERS In the early '50s, soon after WWII, my uncle, Angus Thomas Benton, Jr. (\"Uncle A.T.\") and his wife Ida, often watched flying sa ucers at night, as they patrolled the skies above the Intercoastal Canal, on the gulf of Mexico, within 20 miles of the Vicki Landrum incident, in Pasadena, Texas. During the war, A.T. had been a crack an tiaircraft gunner on the U.S.S. South Dakota (rear left deck, bene ath which a Japanese kamikaze plane crashed and exploded just beneath his platform, killing many of those below deck, as A.T. blazed away, during the \"Great South Pacific Turkey Shoot\"). La ter, the U.S. fleet took possession of the Nagato Maru, Flagship of the Imperial Jap anese First Fleet, in Tokyo Bay, in 1945. A.T. was sent aboard in charge of a five-man crew instructed to collect and arrange worthy souvenirs, from which the officers were to take \"first pick\".

The glasses were one of twelve pairs made for the Japanese fleet, of which onl y seven pairs then remained, since the other five pairs had gone to Da vy Jones' locker. A.T. dismantled the binoculars, threw away his clothes, wrappe d the Nagato's battle flag around half the binoculars, and stuffed them in to his sea bag. He paid his best friend to carry the other half, wrapped in his clothes. The Nagato was eventually sank in the Bikini Island hydrogen bomb test, in the '50s, Yamamoto (who purportedly died earlier in the war), with the assistance of an American-trained deaf mute, had used the glasses to read U.S. Admiral William F. (\"Bull\") Halsey's lips, as he gave commands from the bridge of his flagship, in an earlier engagement from which Yamamoto had wisely decided to withdraw. The binoculars could so magnify a person's face, ei ght miles away, that it appeared to be only a few feet away. One could also see the rings of Saturn, etc. A.T. and Ida used the giant woolen Battle Flag of the Imperial Japanese First Fleet, as a bedspread for several years (somehow in all this, there is the flavor of Bill Mauldin's Willy and Joe!). The souvenirs are now in the possession of my cousin. After the war, A.T. and Ida started a cl eaning shop in Pasadena, which they called the \"U.F.O. Cleaners\" (for \"Undoubtedly Finest Offered\"). A.T. placed Yamamoto's sea glasses atop the roof of his shop, wher e he and Ida watched the flying saucers at night, as they glided over the intercoastal sea lanes. A.T. said some of them appeared to have \"quilted aluminum\" on their bottoms. Th is apparently was the cris-cross ridge patterns of the early stealth technology, de veloped by the Germans during the wartime years for their U-boats, and adapted to the saucers. Contrary to 'history', Admiral Yamamoto, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese First Fleet, may not have been shot down over the western Solomons on Apr. 18, 1943, but may have secretly surrendered to U.S. Naval personnel near Guadalcanal, and been taken to a military jail in the Phillippines, were my neighbor, Antonio Sanchez, probably stood guard over him. When the admiral (Yamam oto?) told Tony in perfect English, that he was educated at Stanford, Tony asked hi m, \"Then why you fight us?\" Yamamoto (?) solemnly answered, \"That was the most regrettable mistake of my entire career.\" \"STARS\" The most obvious sightings today, are right under your noses, if you live in certain areas of the country. For over 40 years, sauc ers have been 'placed' in the skies, locked into stationary positions by the inertial navigation system using the Peiltochterkompass, for use on the Nazi saucers as well as the ro ckets carrying neutron bomb warheads in the 1945 stalemate. The systems allow saucers to pose as 'stars' as they follow constellations across the night skies, t esting new equipment and procedures, and performing experiments and su rveillance on us. During the daylight hours, saucers are less visible, and are often concealed by heavy dark clouds which Dr. Wilhelm Reich called \"DOR\" (\"Deadly ORgone Energy\"). Such hoverings were documented in the early '50s by Reich, over his Maine observatory, using time-lapse photography with such skill that the government labeled them as \"subversion\" and \"espionage\". Reich's photos, which I have seen, reveal ed erratic move ments of the saucers, in contrast to the ALIENS 169"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"background constellations which produced co nsistently parallel, curved streaks of normal stars and planets across the film, as th e earth rotated. Since at the time, use of the guidance systems on saucers was still unde r development, and since the saucers were so electrically unstable, their presence in the time-lapse photos was starkly revealed because they emitted a different light spectrum, and made brighter, 'smeared', meandering blurbs, cutting across the background of fainter stars. Though Reich—an Austrian Jew—held some rather leftist views, he would have been immediately snuffed by the Russian Co mmunists, and certainly didn't work for them. As a psychiatrist, he viewed sexual repression as the primary cause of fascism. His experiments on what he ca lled Orgone Energy, were the basis for the government's abuse of process under which he was not only incarcerated under allegations of insanity, but also held under a conflicting criminal ch arge of contempt, for violating a federal injunction against his work, which it was a lleged constituted \"illegal medical practices\", pursuant to F.D.A. regulations. Reich claimed there is an \"Orgone Energy\" (\"ORGanic Energy\"), which is a naturally-occurring, life-susta ining, environment-permeating ethereal energy related to beneficial negative ions, and that Orgon e has its antithesis, \"DOR\" (\"Deadly ORgon energy\") , a toxic, life-endangering, positively-ionizing substance , related to the 'free radicals' often associated with cancer and other diseases, and manifested in certain types of heavy, dark clouds. He invented a devi ce called a \"cloud buster\", a trombone-like sliding, variable antenna, which induc tively grounded the DOR clouds and \"erased\" them, conducting their death-dealing energy in to a container of water connected to the antenna. Purportedly, the water was converted into heavy water (deuterium). Reich also discovered that his cloud buster could disable UFOs (a discovery which evidently led to his demise). Reich claimed that, in the presence of great amounts of Orgone energy, his instruments detected dange rous levels of DOR aroun d his laboratory, despite 'radioactive shielding', when 1 gram of ra dium was placed there in a thick lead container. He at first blamed the dangerous effects on the radium, until his discovery of the flying saucers hovering continually over his lab. This discovery inflamed the government, and marked Reich for death, pe rhaps because he had stumbled across government \"death ray\" experiments on the public (including Reich). Reich claimed the DOR from the saucers was used to create desertification. On October 10, 1954, Reich disabled two UFOs. On October 15, his associate, William Moise, proudly presented Reich's findi ngs to Colonel Wertenbaker, Deputy Commander, A.T.I.C, Wright-P atterson A.F.B., Ohio. Though Reich believed he had \"made contact with aliens\", he had \"made contact with the Pentagon\" instead. He had stuck his head right into a Secret Government meat grinder. On November 2, 1954, Reich embarked on an experimental expedition to Arizona, where he purportedly proved that, by use of his \"cloud-buster\" to remove DOR being placed in the desert environment by UFOs , grass grew a foot high in previously desertified soil. On return from Arizona, he was arrested by the F.D.A. and jailed in Lewisburg Penitentiary, for violation of an injunction, and was found dead in his cell on Nov. 3, 1957, a week before he was to be released. His books, publications and scientific literature were banned and burned. In the '50s I saw a film made of Reich ou tside his Maine laboratory, as he erased a DOR cloud over a nearby body of water and so me trees, using his cloud-buster. To his ALIENS 170"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"amazement, with the erasure of the cloud, a flying saucer was discovered hovering inside it. Reich's antenna apparently grounded the el ectrical system on the saucer, and it fell toward the ground, as he and his small film crew ran toward the downed saucer, knocking the camera over in the process and ending the film. The government has since stolen the film. The kind of saucer shown in it was of the same general type seen by me in 1953. It is my belief that either a \"st ealth ray-gun\" or the corona discharges of the saucers creates the \"DOR\" effects observed by Reich.] There have been many things written about Reich, much of which is disinformational. Though he made some im portant discoveries, Re ich seemed to be unclear about what was happening, believing that what he was observing were \"alien\" saucers. It appears to me that Reich had either discovered a dange rous side-effect of flying saucers, or had discovered secr et experimentation on the populace and the environment. I tend to think the latter is true, and I would not like to find out that saucers are inherently dangerous. I tend to think th at the DOR was the product of intentional \"population control\" methods and \"stealth we aponry\" being tested or carried out on the general population and the environment by the Secret Government, since Reich was murdered to silence his investigation. Saucers from Sandia and Manzano Bases usually proceeded to their initial night-time positions along my southeastern horizon, at about the same time each evening, in military fashion, despite the fact that sunset comes earlier in winter. The best visibility occurs seasonally, whenever the ev ening trips coincide with dusk...that time between day and night. In the brightness of full daylight in midsummer, a glowing saucer is invisible, while in the half-light of dusk, it is not only obvious, but usually shares the sky with no visible stars or plan ets to confuse it with. Many take up their positions right in front of cloud banks which are clearly visible along the horizon behind them at that time of the evening, before the darkness has caused the clouds to become somewhat transparent to the st ars. It has always amazed me that people unquestioningly view these 'stars'—with clouds behind them —without realizing that clouds are never behind stars! Saucers from Los Alamos (which is primarily engaged in scientific research), have usually taken up their positions further to my northeast, along the western slopes of the southern Sangre de Cristos, often over th e outskirts of Santa Fe . Laser communications beams between the saucers and Los Alamos laboratories, can sometimes be seen, especially when there is mist or dust in the air. Those over the Pecos area to my east usually follow the constellations westward across the night sky where, after around 10 hours of flight, from positions just above the western horizon, they suddenly zip back to their bases just before dawn. The tell-tale things which obviate these saucers are: (1) The off-color (positive, ultraviolet) light spectrum on their bottoms; (2) the overall excessive brightness; (3) the 'hairy' (negative, infra-red) coronal brush fanning out from their tops; (4) the precession, causing excessive and 'overly regular' blinking; (5) the explosive, strobe-like flashes of electrical emissions from an 'anti-precession' stabilizing system (usually u sed when the saucers are moving slowly); and, (6) the bright red, green, blue, white and yellow emi ssions of laser communications devices. These phony stars can be segregated fro m the real ones, by use of special photographic equipment, using spectrographi c means to differen tiate the radiation projected by them, or can be detected by am ateur photographers by use of special films, filters and lenses, which are available commercia lly. Detection is also possible by digital ALIENS 171"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"analysis of video footage shot with telephoto lenses. At night, it is usually difficult to make out the surface details of these sau cers, because of the obliterating contrast between the bright surface corona and the blac k sky, which defeats the eyes. That is the reason the best photos have been made in bright sunlight, which penetrates the corona clouds and reflects back off the metallic surf aces underneath. Dulled, darkened surfaces have been used, but the saucers still show as obvious silhouettes. The alarming degree to which many pe ople have become brainwashed is demonstrated by the fact that these saucers are in plain view at night, yet most people ignore them, accepting them as 'normal'. Many younger people (bel ow forty) have never seen the sky any other way. Yet, in many cases, the behavior of the saucers is so outrageous, that only a fool would accept them as \"stars\", \"planes\", or \"helicopters\". They hover for hours, blinking, wobbling, flashing, meandering, beaming out multi-colored lights, and often jumping or shooting around, while numbed-out, intimidated, brainwashed people refuse to al low themselves to believe there is anything extraordinary or unnatural about them. I once pointed a large one out to a neighbor, as it hovered over a nearby government bombing ra nge between Galisteo and Santa Fe. We then drove from Lamy, to Galisteo, across a dirt road to State Rd. 14, up to Santa Fe, then back to Lamy. We drove completely around it, while continually viewing it, yet afterward, my neighbor refu sed to allow himself to believe he had seen anything other than a 'star', even after I explained ho w and why one cannot 'drive around' a star! Another characteristic I noted while viewing saucers many times, as they flew right over Santa Fe at night, is that they appear to imitate small planes, but they seem to have a problem with moving at the speed of a normal plane. If they move too fast, they make brightly glowing, tell-tale streaks, so must move 'too' slow to disguise this (about 20-30 m.p.h.), below the stall speed of a light plan e. Some of the strobe-like flashes are not stabilization systems, but are used to hide the faint glows of the saucers' hulls. Also, the fact that it takes a 'slow-moving' saucer too long to pass over Santa Fe, while making no noise, is another dead give-away, especially when a saucer just 'parks' for a half hour or so over the southwest outskirts of Santa Fe. I once pointed a saucer out to a tenant, as it soundlessly approached Lamy low to the ground from the east, flashing its laser comm unicators, as it went down not over 250 yards away. The tenant, named Kroy Rubin, was totally unable to relate to the experience as being real. In a couple of days , I heard rumors that a nearby rancher—Joe Miller—had complained that 'dogs from Lamy ', or 'coyotes', had killed some of his livestock, within a hundred yards of where I saw the saucer land. Since publication of my first edition in 1993, the saucers normal ly visible near my home began to diminish, as the government began to exercise more discretion. More recently, the number of saucers is only a tiny percentage of what it once was. Shortly after my first printing, I disc ussed this book with Joe Miller, while attending a small annual community flea market in nearby Galisteo. Joe said he had four young bulls mutilated at that time, which were 'bloodless', with the usual precise, cauterized cuts, etc. The bulls appeared to be air-dropped back into the pasture. The rumor I had heard—that Joe believed \"dogs\" had mutilated his cattle—was a completely false rumor spread by the O.S.I. Joe said that he had never suspected \"dogs\" or \"predators\", since the 'mutilations' were cl early of human, government origin, consistent with the findings of State Police inves tigator Gabe Valdez, who had performed the investigation. Not only had I and Kroy Rubin watched a saucer go down on Miller's ALIENS 172"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"ranch, but had done so while it was either in the process of picking up Joe Miller's bulls, or dropping them back into the pasture. Since Miller is definitely among those like myself, who think Gabe Valdez has done a good job, he has been intensely harassed for over five years by the County of Santa Fe and the Sheriffs department, using any excuse. In 1995 they abused Joe and his wife, and eventually had to pay him considerable damages. The manner of con tinued abuse indicated that there was a concealed motive behind the abuse, which was not apparent from the circumstances, similar to how I was treated for so long. I theorized a link between the legal a buse and Miller's corroboration of Gabe Valdez' investigation and theory, since I had been severely abused by the judicial and legal system under trumped up charges based on lies and tampered evidence, at the same time that ex-FBI agent Ken Rommel was conducting a mutilations 'investigation' through the Santa Fe D.A.'s office. The multicolored laser communications system I observed on the saucer which landed on Miller's land was identical to what I'd observed in the mid south Atlantic in late 1974. This system on the saucers allows for multiple transmi ssions, as well as complex coding. Unless an observer is in alignment with the laser trajectory, he cannot possibly listen to it, or receive it, and then only if he has the special receiver. The combined or separate beams carry th e coded or voiced communications, through modulations in beam intensity and intermittence. A receiver consists of a special scope with lenses, which receives and translates the beams, similar to an infra-red system. The communications system is very secure, outside of personal compromises, and traverses the problem of radio wave blockage or inte rference from electrical corona discharges from the saucer. The only draw back is the necessity for line-of-sight communications. Those having access are controlled by nati onal security contracts, making them criminally liable and subject to severe penal ties (even death) without hearing or trial, for a breach, under \"national security laws\". These procedures are unconstitutional, but the Trilateral Commission/Illuminati has never been hindered by that, and neither have the Masonic Order, the Jesuits, the Mafia, the K.G.B., the Mossad, or any other secret organization. I observed this system in October, 1974, in the mid south Atlantic, en route between Savannah, Georgia, and Casablanca, Morocco, while aboard the Kraljevicka, one of the freighters of the Jugolinea, the socialist Yugoslavian national shipping line. Ironically, it was only a few days after I had met and shook hands with Trilateral Commission member Jimmy Carter, a former nuclear engineer and sub commander, as he campaigned for the governorship of Georgia, in the historic part of Savannah near the old Customs House, during a holiday, shortl y before the November elections of 1974. The weather was stormy on that passage, an d since I have always enjoyed storms, I had walked out onto the left rear deck just after supper, to observe the sunlight, as it disappeared beneath a hole in the clouds to ward the western horizon, on that October evening. I had been on deck for only a couple of minutes when I observed a flying saucer coming out of the clouds around a mile behind the ship. It took up and maintained a steady position, as it began to make laser transmissions, presumably to the ship's communications officer on the bridge. I obse rved these transmissions for around thirty minutes, before the saucer retreated back up into the clouds above it, as the golden light faded from the window in the clouds over the gusty sea. I sighed in amazement, then walked back inside. As I stepped into the hallway, three of the Yugoslavian officers ALIENS 173"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"came downstairs from the bridge at my upper right. The first man—the communications chief—was pushing a little telescopic antenna- like projection in on what appeared to be a small electro-optical scope he had in his hands, upon which I saw what appeared to be calibrations, code letters, lenses, and sensors. As the three officers saw from whence I came, they immediately slowed, and looked at each other and back to the scope, as the officer sheepishly placed it in his upper shirt pocket, and they walked on by, shaking their heads and mumbling pursed-lipped good-evenings, with some embarrassment. At that time, N.A.T. O. 'war games' were occurri ng. Though Yugoslavia was not a member, they conducted 'sympathy maneuvers', rolling their tanks and divisions into place along the Soviet borders facing Russia. I knew that a helicopter coming from a ship nowhere to be seen, would not have stay ed so long, or come from so far away, or have been taking such risks in stormy weat her, way out in the central South Atlantic. 1,100 miles to land in either direction. It should also be remembered that Tesla was a native of Yugoslavia. Though the Kraljevicka carried the red star of communism on its stacks, its crew and officers were at least 95% pro-capitalist. However, am ong all of the Mediterranean or Adriatic nations, socialist Yugoslav ia was pitifully poor. Those lucky enough and enterprising enough to sail on the Judgolinea in 1974, had opportunities to engage in some profitable smuggling. For those not so inclined, it was like a sentence to prison, away from their families, with pay below that of their international capitalist contemporaries. One young officer, recently married, wanted to take his wife and defect, because he had spent only a couple of weeks with her out of his first two years of marriage. The socialist government required him to work for menial wages on the ship until he had 'repaid the state' for his engineering education. He was too naive and inexperienced to smuggle, but some young members of the crew were already making plenty of money without the benefits of a formal education, because of their 'supplemental' smuggling income. One enterpri sing young sailor, at the bottom of the totem pole, made fake soles fo r his shoes out of 'blonde Lebanese' and 'black Pakistani' hashish, wore them ashore and sold them, then brazenly waltzed back up the gang-plank in classy, new and dapper attire, and a pocket full of money. The captain's pay was round $4,000 per y ear, yet he was obviously a closet capitalist who supplemented his income simi larly, on a higher scale, judging by his smooth demeanor, and the car from Santa Fe in which he arrive at the ship, just before departing Houston. I would tend to think \"Rus sian icons\", since I knew the car belonged to a Santa Fe art dealer I knew, of Yugosl avian descent. I recently—over 24 years later- -met his cousin in Santa Fe, so I guess my assumptions were correct. One young crew member, whose ambition it was to become a successful, American-style rock musician, had to wear long-sleeved shirts to conceal the \"Young Communist Pioneers\" tatoo which he had fool ishly allowed to be put on his arm during his earlier years, later concealed in shame, so that other crew members would not point at it and jeer. Only a small number of pass engers or crew were K.G.B. informants or agents, as was obvious from their sour a nd bitter dispositions, and the way everyone avoided them, or behaved hypocritically in the presence of. The young Yugoslavians were generally hostile toward domination by the Russians, and proud of Yugoslavia's long tradition of fierce and he roic warriors.

Since this book has stirred up a renewed inte rest in \"government flying saucers\" in this growing area, with several new subdivisions nearby, th e Secret Government is now being forced by the publicity into finding other areas further away from encroaching population, since people seem to be rediscovering the validity of their own eyesight. THE MIND CLEANERS As you may have noticed, the \"space alien\" propaganda blitzes come in periodic waves, on a regular basis, to continually revi ve in your mind the corporate lie they have already planted there, that space aliens are \"here\". As long as we, the tax payers, through our government, continue to supply th e money for the personnel, scripts, and productions, Hollywood will continue to use our funds to brainwash and deceive us, under the guise of \"entertainment\". Lately, th e Official Big Liars have settled down to a single 'type' of space alien, which looks suspic iously like an old comic book type, which conveniently also looks like a small human be ing actor, outfitted with a more easily fabricated costume, mask, and makeup; this also looks like the rhesus monkies of the \"Roswell\" and \"MJ-12\" hoaxes. The eyes are sunglass-type dark lenses, which conceal the actors' human eyes. This format was necess itated by the fact that some of the Old Big Lies had not only become difficult to fabricate in a convincing way (four arms, serpent skin, etc.), even for an increasi ngly more sophisticated audience, but also because a more \"humanoid\" type \"space alien\" format has proven to be more believable, and can be more easily faked by actors, makeup artists, costumers, and special effects technicians. The huxters can also point back to the corny Roswell hoax, minus the embarrassingly stupid photos, and, using the MJ-12 documents created in 1985 based on the 'standard' format, which harks back to the 'cynocephalus' rhesus monkies of the originally bungled Roswell hoax. They have returned to the Roswell hoax, like dogs returning to lick up their own vomit. The scenario has progressed much further out in Nevada's so-c alled \"Dreamland\", at Groom Lake, where the government has set up almost an entire base for this fakery. There are some highly classifi ed projects under way at the base, but due to its weird terrain and obscure location, the government al so uses the base for one of its special misinformation centers, perhaps to emphasize its need to conceal the projects. Security agents specially trained in the hoax—like Bob Lazar—convince their curious victims on the outside, that they are \"ex-employees\" of an \"Area 51\" top secret government project, and go through incredibly complex and expens ive manipulations, to convince \"specially chosen\" (i.e., gullible) suckers, that they are attempting to \"alarm the public\" about how ALIENS 175"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"\"aliens from space are taking over\". They drug th e rubes, take them to a special part of their \"secret base\", and expose them to \"t hings\"—such as a fake little flying saucer with a tiny seat in it—designed to convince them that a small, non-human 'alien' had come to earth in it, so that the dupes will go out and \"spread the word\". Bob Lazar did this to a somewhat easy-mark gullible friend of mine, who is still unable to accept the fact that our government would go to such extremes to hide flying saucers being operated by it. The government even uses \"d esigner drugs\" in this brainwashing project, skillfully making suggestions under their influence, breaking down psychological resistance, and inducing very convincing hallucinations, while the victims remain unaware that they are under the influence of drugs. (Yes, I know what you guys are up to!) The fact remains that many people really want to believe such lies, right along with a lot of the other mystical baloney some people want to cling to, like an old Viking who can't stop swearing to Odin. The old Army \"Mind Control\" expe riments support these hoaxes. That means that the U.S. Army and the intelligence community were probably conducting their original experi ments for use on us for the CFR all along, rather than for use on any \"foreign enemy\". (See Walter Bowa rt's Operation Mind Control, and John Mark's The Search for the \"Manchuria n Candidate\", for some more related background information.) The basic thing drastically c ontradicting this scenario, is that anyone working in such a project—including Bob Lazar—would ha ve a top-secret or higher clearance, and would now be in jail or dead, for violating th e national security agreement they signed when their clearance was issued. He would be behind bars or worse, for merely confirming anything seen, known, or even suspected as a consequence of working there. This would happen especially if it were true that space alie ns were visiting us, or were taking over. I signed a national security agreement in 1957, when I was only eighteen years old, and in those days, it was understood by most that the penalty could include an \"executive termination order\" (an order to assassinate a disobedient person). Though I don't want to scare you, some unfo rtunates in the more distant past have been lobotomized, incarcerated in asylums a nd perpetually drugged or sedated, jailed in special prisons, illegally entrapped, falsely convicted and imprisoned, driven insane, crippled, given \"dumb drugs\", impoverished, had their marriages or families torn apart, turned into homeless persons or vagrants, totally intimidated, socially isolated, or had their credibilities ruin ed so that no one would believe them. Wilhelm Reich was arrested, incarcerated in an asylum, and murdered there. His arrest came only two days after a discussion he had with Einstein at Princet on, about his investigation at his Maine lab involving discoveries con cerning flying saucers. There seems to be more probability for legal protection today from the kinds of abuse which only a few years ago the governme nt could get away with, while taking their impunity for granted, but the public is much less tolerant to such abuse today. Consistent with Jefferson's adage that \"the price of liberty is eternal vigilance\", we must forever question everything con cerning flying saucers, gravity, and \"extraterrestrials\", and realize that the Secret Government is responsible for endless misinformation, overstatement and understatement (the \"untruth, the half-truth and the truth-and-a-half). We should question outrage ous claims of personal experiences which are obviously fabricated by liars, drug-induced dupes, nuts, or secret agents, and remember not to confuse them with legitim ate witnesses.

If you have seen something which does not comport with accepted theories, and talk about it, be forewarned that \"truth is stranger than fiction\", and can damage one's credibility. Sometimes, too much truth, too soon, is more than most people can handle. Insidiously, agents of the Secret Govern ment pound away from every conceivable perspective. While some govenment fronts (mostly \"UFOlogists\") promote the paranormal, others, such as one led by Philip Klass, pose as debunkers, which I call \"pseudo-debunkers\", in support of the governm ent, which 'officially' denies everything. Paranormalists, pseudo-debunkers, and government deniers form a triangle of withering crossfire, and triangles, as you should know, are strong, rigid shapes, unless they are composed of weak or brittle materials. Ratio nalists ought to occupy the side held by the paranormalists, who actually belong with the pseudo-debunkers, sin ce their undisclosed ulterior agenda is the perpetuation of 'party- line' relativism (which Klass wouldn't dare have the guts to oppose), based on a Platonist ep istemology. In truth, all three sides of the triangle are created and controlled by the O.S.I. The pseudo-debunkers are led by Philip Klass, ostensibly sponsored by th e Smithsonian Institution, and Klass, the government spokesmen, and the paranormalists/UFOlogists are all restricted and controlled by the N.S.A./CIA/O.S.I., C.S.I.C.O.P. and the \"pse udo-skeptic\" movement, represented primarily by the Skeptical Inquirer magazine, and The Skeptic magazine, were create d by the O.S.I./CIA to make inroads into the humanist/skeptic philosophical movement, and to covertly control it (as they had done with the Libe rtarian movement) because they correctly perceived a potential future threat from th is quarter, represente d by reasonable and analytical people like me. The following facs imile clipping, of March 9, 1991, (original in The Santa Fe New Mexican) announced a \"debunking\" lecture by Philip Klass, entitled \"Bringing UFOs Down to Earth\" (for which we already know what the conclusion was) as follows (emphasis mine): ALIENS 177"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"The \"questions\" asked by Klass were really statements, in which he purported to arrogate to himself what \"...even experienced military and airline pilots\" saw, presuming that they were \"...unwitting victims of myth and their imaginations.\" These pilots fly- almost every day, for thousands of hours, for thousands of days. What would they know about what they see? When you board an airlin er, you place your life in their hands, but if you believed Klass, you would never ride an airplane again! Experienced pilots have years of training and experience interpreting what they see—weather patterns, cloud formations, other aircraft, velocities, directions , etc., etc.—and military pilots are trained to identify other aircraft and their flight ch aracteristics very specifically. What do the hell do they know? Why, Phili p Klass, who flies his CIA desk all over the world...in his dreams...knows more than the pilots do, ri ght?

Klass has made a \"paranormal claim\" here again, that hundreds—even thousands—of se parate people (including pr ofessional aeronautical experts) have \"mystically\" seen the same things, at the same times. And some of these people were airline pilots, military pilots, radar operators, etc.—recognized \"experts\" in what they do, which is flying, controlling, and identifying aircraft (really a bunch of bumbling amateurs, in comparison to Klass, wouldn't you say?). These were not members of some fanatical religion, witnessing an \"apparition of the Virgin\", etc., but certified, professional, experienced, aeronautical experts, required to pass high level visual and spatial percep tion tests, who are constantly tested for signs of psychiatric problems, whose experience is relied upon by thousands of people.

Klass's allegations were completely unsupported by \"physical evidence\" that the people who reported the sightings were ma king any paranormal claims, or that they believe in anything paranorma l whatsoever. By Klass's own standard, his claim was a knowingly false, fraudulent claim, more appropriately called a LIE. Who is the \"unwitting victims of myth and their imagin ations\"? Klass definitely fits the mold of his own statement. C.G. Jung would call this a \"projection\" (of Klass's mental fixation, neurosis, ps ychosis, or aberration, whic h he \"projected\"onto hundreds, thousands, or even millions of other people, as if it were THEY who in fact had his problem). Klass (and his O.S.I. mentors) sociopathically chose the paranormalist element—which had absolutely nothing to do with this situation (except they were created by the CIA, the Nazi SS RSHA, and Hans Horbiger) because it represented a weak and irrational position—a 'straw man', set up to be knocked down—intentionally \"designed' to give 'mystical' and irrational significance to particular events. Thus the CIA covertly created the opening into which their pseudo-skeptics inserted the 'wedge' of pseudo-reason. The paranormalists were created by and are clandestinely controlled by the same \"forked-tonged' O.S.I. intelligence agency which handles Klass, and harks back to Reinhard Gehlen's Amt VI SS RSHA, which formed the core of the new CIA/O.S.I. in 1946, and as such, was the Nazi 'standard b earer' of Hans Horbiger's parapsychology straw man' in this hoax. The Nazis were the designers and trainers of Klass' pseudo-skeptic C.S.I.C.O.P. program, which is more parapsychological than any of those who made the claimed sightings, beca use those of C.S.I.C.O.P. SAW NOTHING, because THEY WEREN'T THERE, and presented no evidence of paranormal claims. As the following clipping shows, Klass dr ew a 'packed audience' in the 'captive audience' government town, Los Alamos. Most of the audience were instructed by their supervisors to 'be seen' at the lecture, 'or else', in military fashion. Too bad Klass couldn't wave his magic wand and make the burns and radiation poi soning suffered by Vicki Landrum, Colby Lee Landrum, and Betty Cash go away. That is \"physical evidence\" of the most severe kind. Klass, pretending to rely upon an Aristotelian epistemolo gy, contradict ed himself, and dishonestly deceived his audience with false arguments which begged the questions that \"UFO sighters\" believe UFOs are extraterrestrial, that they believe in \"ghosts\" and \"the paranormal\", and that they are 'chosen' because they believe in ghosts and aliens. These claims by Klass are \"paranormal\". Also, since Klass believes in a \"supreme being\" according to recent news articles, he is a \"closet paranormalist\", by his own standard. I certainly don't believe in ghosts or any other paranormal crap, but I have seen many saucers. These errors, which clearly show Klass's dishonesty, are the false assumptions upon which Klass's entire argument rests, and a false assumption used to win an argument by fraud, is an unforgivable crime to any true skeptic like myself. In the second column, in which Klass refers to \"physical evidence\"—which he says is ALL man-made—he inadvertently admits that ALL flying saucers are man-made. Klass must deny that he has ever seen a flying saucer, because, were he to admit seeing one, logic would requir e him to agree with this book, based on the MOST RATIONAL ASSUMPTION.

As for the \"cigar -shaped spacecraft\" si ghted on March 3, 1968 (column one, paragraph four), the shape of such an object, seen high enough in the sky to represent the point at which it entered th e atmosphere, would not be visible as \"cigar- shaped.\" Besides, I myself have seen similar craft. On the evening of January 26, 1996, at the Ten Thousand Waves Japanese Health Spa, on the western slopes of the Sangre de Cristos Mountains, above the city of Santa Fe, at approximately 7:00 o'clock p.m., as I sa t in a hot tub with several others, I met a young woman who had read my book, just as I spotted a \"blinking\" aircraft moving slowly above the mountains, about 10,000 feet above our position.

When they move faster, they glow brighter, which is why they are going so slow.\" At that very moment, the ship on the left li t up a dark green, soft glowing color, as it took off in a large circle which took it right back to its previ ous position, where it stopped on a dime, and returned to its small, \"flashing aircraft\" mode. As it was flying in the circle, I asked, \"Does everyone see that thing?\", to which they all said \"Yes!\", as I followed it with my arm and pointing finger. It took about ten seconds, and the circle was about thirty degrees across, so at 10, 000 feet, it was doing about 2.000 m.p.h. At arm's length, it was about 1\" long, and about 3/4\" wide, so that means it was about 400' long and 250' wide. It's thickness, based on a proportional estimate, was around 50'. The ship was virtually a five-story building, having the size and shape of the space at a football field with the track around it. It was lenticular in shape, like a lozenge, with rounded edges. The following is a copy of a painting I did of the ship: There was a 'dark space\" around its immedi ate periphery, beyond which there was a purplish \"Tesla corona\", which extended out for some distance in advance of the ship, and fanned out along the sides as it moved thro ugh space. A ship of that size would be large enough to carry a whole battalion.

I s ee you've sold out to the alien liars.\" In 1961, some friends of mine, oil operator George P. Parker and his wife Margery, of Midland, Texas, and her brother Gordon (a n F.A.A. official) a nd his wife, told me about the time they decided to 'innocently' walk into a box canyon (\"Manzano-Coyote Canyon\"), called \"Manzano Base\", near Kirt land A.F.B., in Albuquerque, back in the early '50s. Their plan was to pose as casual hikers, so they could check out rumors of a government flying saucer base there. Like an other friend, the late Bob Guthrie of Santa Fe later experienced, they were surrounded by troops carrying star wars weapons, as a row of flying saucers hovered over them. In di re fear of their lives, they were ordered out, and instructed never to say anything about what they saw. The following facsimile clipping relates to 1980 sightings at Manzano Base (emphasis mine): The above clipping shows that Jerry Miller, a former Project Blue Book investigator until that program ended in 1969, was later re-employed in the 1980s as an Air Force \"scientific adviser\" (Air Force O.S.

It becomes clearer as to how these double-t alk specialists are moved around by the government from one place to another, to se ll the public the same kind of evasiveness, and how the evasiveness of Air Force \"sci entific advisers\" (O.S.I. agents) are periodically enmeshed with the likes of Philip Klass and his C.S.I.C.O.P. and pseudo-skeptic ilk. It is Klass's CIA O.S.I. (Office of Scientific Intelligence) job, to pick up where Jerry Miller, of Air Force O.S.I., le ft off, to 'interpret' (i.e., \"debunk\") the legitimate sightings of the public , as well as those of guar ds, air force personnel, state policemen, airline pilots, and certified civilian aeronautical experts, as the result of \"over-active imaginations\" and \"paranormal beliefs\". If there is an active imagination at work here, I think it is the imagination of Klass and his ilk, in inventing new false arguments and BIG LIES to counteract the ev idence of the personal experiences and 20- 20 sightings of seasoned airlin e pilots and radar operators. Most of the Platonist mysticism attacked by Klass and his pseudo-Aristotelians, is induced or spread by corresponding Platon ist government-funded counterparts, the paranormal front groups, which descend fro m the Cayce group originally set up at Wright-Patterson A.F.B., Ohio, in the early '40s, including Project Bluebook, to conceal saucer secrets and promote the BIG LIES, based on the original \"parapsychology\" of Hitler's guru and 'spiritual adviser', Hans Horbiger, the \"father of parapsychology\". Georgi Ivanovich Gurdjieff—often confused with Grigori Gurdjieff, even by his own followers—was a deranged, mystical Turkish/Russian occultist 20 , who was initiated by Sufi masters, before branching off to form his own twisted philosophy. Gurdjieff produced much suffering in the end, via hi s 'students', Dietrich Eckhardt and General Karl Haushoffer (Hitler's groom ers), who were Gurdjieff s students, along with a host of other monsters. We know a woodsman by his chips, and Gurdjieff's 'chips' were all too often some of the world's host heinous monsters. The modern Russian anti-Semitic movement seemed to germinate in this mysticism, along with totalitari anism. Decayed mystical philo sophies are fertile soil for the growth of other unhealthy mystical ph ilosophies. Almost a ll the top fascist and communist leaders of the 20th century we re students of Gurdjieff, including Mao Tsedong, Stalin, and Ernst Roehm, the homos exual head of Hitler's S.A., who carried out the 'Knight of the Long Knives', the long march of \"Kristallnacht\". The Baltic-born Platonist, Alfred Rosenberg, adapted Plato's heirarchy to Nazi society, emulating those in Pl ato's Republic, the Iron, Bronze, Silver and Gold, with the SS being the Golden \"philosopher-rulers\" at th e top. This heiratic order was in turn derived from Chaldean-based Hermetic and Egyptian esoteric teachings, extracted by Plato from Egyptian and Assy rian sources a few years before Alexander's conquests. The duality so typical of the Nazis and the Trilateral Commission, is based on the myth in which Hermes and Aphrodite loved each ot her so much that they became one person, an Hermaphrodite. This relates to the Nazi troop management manual written by Ernst Roehm, the homosexual \"father of the brownshirts\" , who advocated a military \"group identity\" principal, erroneously alleged to be derived from Spartacism, including the idea 20 Michael Howard, The Occult Conspiracy, De stiny Books, Rochester Vermont [1989].

Roehm wa s executed by Hitler for turning the S.A. into a homosexual Nazi/Sparticist drag circus.

There is always confusion and misp erception as to what \"excellent\" military performance is. Those who are impressed with the parades of spit-and-polish, goose- stepping jack-booted thugs in beautiful uniforms, marching in perfect precision, such as those in Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will—a propaganda film commissioned by Hitler—are bound to make the mistakes of hi story. Who won the war on the field of battle? Was it those who marched so prissy? No! It was American guerilla fighters who continued to fight when 'order' had broke n down, at the Battle of the Bulge. The \"Redcoats\" at Lexington were mostly Hessian s who marched and looked rather smart in their beautiful rank and file, but the Minutem en shot them like fish in a barrel. How could they miss? Before WW II, Hermann Goering was an \"ecologist\"—the Waldmeister—keeper of the Bavarian forests. In ecology, one specie is sometimes sacrificed for the benefit of another, in order to achieve a (teleological ) \"balance of nature\". A forest is often \"thinned out\", because its population may be \"too great\". By construction, one can move the concept of ecology around to the human race, so they can be \"thinned out\" like \"weeds\". My point is that the kind of peop le who want to control the population—often attempt to convince us they are only interested in 'ecol ogy', also making (insincere) overtures to entice our curiosities about d ecadent old secret mystery societies, maybe even appealing to ethnic, religious, racial or tribal sympathies—and are the kind of people who will tell you whatever it takes to motivate you at your own level, to support their plans, which may incl ude the extermination of yo u as an \"undesirable\" or \"expendable person\", like a \"human weed\". I am appealing to your rati onal self-interest, since it is irrational to sponsor the extermin ation or enslavement of others, just because you are led to believe you will benefit from it, because sooner or later, in a criminal society, the business end of the gun moves around to you. The individual human life is the ultimate value because you are human. The kind of people who want to talk you out of the validity of your senses, as tools of cognition, and to convince you that your life is just an illusion, while saying \"all things are possible\", are trying to trade you a bill of goods for your Bill of Rights. These same people do not want to improve the clarity of your thinking, or to root out and expose the high and mighty power rats who control our government. You will never hear them trying to take power away from the Trilateral Commission-C.F.R. bunch. They only want to throw a monkey wrench into the cogs of your mind, so you will never figure them out, and will do as you are told. Refusing to believe what one sees is Platonistic and mystical, not Aristotelian and rational. Believing what you see, what you have good reason to believe is true, and what you have good reason to believe others have seen or know, is the rational, scientific approach. It is also reasonable to be susp icious of government truth-saboteurs who mix phony, pseudo-Aristotelian epistemology with Pl atonist bullshit.

A future plot's \"ger mination\" was revealed by a clipping of March 11, 1993, by Cox News Service. A synopsis of the clipping is as follows: In rural Alabama, a 'documentary' film maker became a \"police officer\", while a nother \"UFO professional\" (Linda Moulton Howe) interjected her \"expert\" (O.S.I.) twisted opinion that \"aliens\" are responsible for \"bloodless cattle mutilations\" in Alabama, near Sand Mountain. Howe's officious covert CIA intermeddling was necessary to fabricate groundwork for her next government-backed film. In the Alabama back-w oods locale, there was little of the type of official denials which relied on the \"documentation\" of ex-F.B.I. agent/federal grant huxter Ken Rommel (which attri buted mutilations to 'preda tors'), with more credence being given to New Mexico St ate Police mutilations investigator Gabe Valdez' \"secret government medical experiments\" theory (\"..Another theory: Government agents, flying in low-level helicopters at night, are killing animals and removing their organs to study the effects [testing for cancer a nd other diseases] on livestock living near high-power lines.\"). Meanwhile, local skeptic and good ol' boy John Strawn of Albertville saw through the corn, but threw out the baby with the ba th water, intimidated by the C.S.I.C.O.P. false accusation that seeing \"flying saucers\" equated with seeing \"little green men\". He mentioned a \"swamp ape\" rumor (Hapi?), probably spread by Nazi/CIA Egyptologists out of the N.A.S.A./O.S.I. center in nearby Huntsville—the \"Peenemunde of America\"—created by the Illu minist, Wernher von Braun. Ag ain, through a fraudulent mixture of Platonist and Aristotelian epis temology under the \"government agent theory\" of cattle mutilations, \"saucers\" were disassociated from \"mutilations\", and \"copters\" were switched for saucers, in these sightin gs by a gullible, back-woodsy 'audience' in rural Alabama. My applause goes to the Cox News Service for a comparatively fair and objective article. A 1993 example of false propaganda—an AP article in the Albuquerque Journal, of March 12, 1993—regarding Manzano Base (A .K.A. \"Coyote Cany on\", referred to earlier), stated that the government now calls the \"...hollowe d out mountain bunker complex\" (the '50s 'star wars' flying sauc er base in the Manzano mountain box canyon \" a n old weapons storage site\" and \"archive of top-secret parts from old nuclear weapons\". The article further stated that only \"last year\", \"nuclear weapons\" were moved from there to a \"new undergroun d storage bunker\" at Kirtland A.F.B. Just before the purported \"move\" to Kirtla nd, it came to the attention of federal officers that New Mexico Land Grant heirs own the property in Coyote Canyon, and that the government never acquired title (an 'omi ssion' previously ignored by defense department property procurement agents). Si nce even N.S.A. rules cannot authorize the U.S. government to claim title, except by prop er purchase and deed from the grant heirs, the government's use violates the (international) 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, and is in contempt of Congress, for a fra udulent breach of their trusteeship duties. So—if the article is even partly credible—the Defense Department high-tailed it to Kirtland with its saucer/star wars paraphernalia, leaving the D.O.E. holding the bag, since the grant heirs now had a legal right to immediate possession of the base, as well as to recover damages for the wrongful ouster, illegal detainer, uncompensated use, and radioactive contamination.

VICKI LANDRUM On Nov. 5, 1975, Travis Walton, a young federal employee of the U.S. Forest Service in Arizona, and his fellow crew memb ers, were leaving work just after dark, driving a pickup slowly toward Heber, over a rocky road through the isolated timberland of Sitgreaves National Forest, northeast of Phoenix. When they encountered a glowing, ovalesque, government flying saucer hovering within 20 feet of the ground, around 8 x 20 feet in size, they stopped the truck, a nd Walton walked directly toward the saucer, despite the fact that it had its warning b eeper on. As Walton approached dangerously near to the saucer, the turbine whined, the saucer precessed, and Walton was struck by an electric arc which passed through him to the ground. Walton was knocked down and struck his head on rocks, causing a concus sion, rendering him unconscious. This bolt of high-voltage, high frequency A.C. current, wa s the 'ether-blocking' current which Tesla used on the bottom of his saucers when hove ring. Lucky for the drunk Walton that it was a Tesla current, the high frequency 'skin ef fect' of which did not really harm him, but must have startled him so much that he lost his balance, fell down, and hit his head. As Walton laid there unconscious, his fellow crew members panicked and fled in the truck in blind fear. On realizing that Walton had been abandoned in an unconscious and injured state, the saucer crew picked him up and took him to a secret flying saucer flight training base infirmary. Government doctors kept Walton in an unconscious state, probably with chloral hydrate (a soporific), allowing him to regain temporary consciousness only for purposes of an \"alien abduction hoax\" they enacted, thus attempting to prepare him for later use as a 'witness'. Midgets—or what could have been children or small women—dressed in our standard 'alien' get-ups, stood about him as he awakened. Walton later initially repo rted hearing one of them speaking in a southern drawl, until they realized Walton was conscious and stopped speaking. Walton wandered about in a dazed state for a while, vi siting a saucer flight simulator which was equipped with an astronomical projector, and saw three saucer types—ovalesque, rounded, and sauceresque—all \"without angles \" and constructed of polished metal. His description of the simulator's visibility and navigation system is consistent with the use of geodetic I.G.S. transponders for navigati on, and electronic image converter tubes (I.R.), mounted in the saucer's surface, to project images of th e outer landscape and cosmos onto a globular screen surrounding the pilot's seat. Walton was then subdued and re-sedated by mute, normal-sized people (both men and women), disguised as \"a liens\" with identical long, dirty blond wigs, makeup, and clothes. Walton's description of the midget participants was consistent with the 'foam rubber masks' and 'sunglass-lens eyes' scenario, intended to hark back to the \"Roswell\" hoax. This story bears certain similarities to that of Vicki Landrum, except for the phony aliens about which Walton now lies, and the fact that all the Walton incident witnesses were federal employees. Had Landrum gone along with the program, she and Betty Cash might be rolling in cash from 'their movie'. Nothing has been said recently about the \"space alien with a southern drawl\", since Walton's initial report. Perhaps that 'alien' was recruited in the Huntsville, Alabama area , by Wernher von Braun, unless they talk \"southern\" in outer space. You might be a redneck if you use your flying saucer for a chicken coop, and take your barbecue sa uce with you on 'mutilations' missions.

Their incident has become one na gging and persistent ac he in the Big Lie program, ever since this book came out in 1993. Prior to that, The UFO Encyclopedia 21 at least admitted that Betty Cash had devel oped breast cancer, and that Vicki reported seeing a \"diamond-shaped\" ship, but added th at it must have been an \"...unshielded nuclear reactor\" (since Betty, Vicki and Colb y Lee all had apparent and indisputable radiations burns). A levitating, unshield ed nuclear reactor? Sure sounds like a government flying saucer to me. As stated previously in the Introducti on, the process of concealment involves obliteration of the \"Most Rational Alternative\" to the two sets of Big Lies—those of the Klass Psychophants and thos e of the (George) Adamski Psychophants—so that the generally conservative public buys the first set, the lunatic fringe buys the second one, and the two mutually complimentary sets of lies fit tightly together to exclude reason. The \"alien\" and \"paranormal\" issues are so fi rmly attached to the \" belief in saucers\", that those who see saucers automatically beli eve they are seeing \"space aliens\". With this false idea firmly implante d in their minds, their hearts usually pound so hard in their throats and brains, that their perception is altered, as their imaginations conjure up pictures of pilots with larg e (\"sunglass lens\") eyes, large heads, and small noses and mouths, because they have been brainwashed for over 50 years. All they really see is a damned flying machine, flown by human be ings, but the cunning interjection of the incredible possibility that alie ns are involved, drives the ' quasi-realistic' people into the Klass position (that saucers don't exist), l eaving the Adamski mystical masochists behind with the O.S.I, con-artists, as 'partn ers in martyrdom', while ridicule is heaped upon all witnesses, whether the false ones (t he agents posing as irrational dupes), or rational and sane analysts such as myself. Some government agents posture themselves in an 'anti-government' stance—to convince us they are legitimate seekers of the truth—to put the idea clear out of our minds that they might be government agents, telling whatever stories necessary to motivate dupes at their own le vels. Doesn't it give you a nice warm feeling when you hear someone seeming to reflect your ever y belief...someone you can trust? This is supposed to make you believe whatever they say. Whenever you hear someone like that, question their motives, as they try to exploi t you through your's. There is usually some contradiction between their c onduct and their vested interest s. For example, if Philip Klass really applied the stri ngent \"test\" which he says he does, requiring \"physical evidence\" for proof of the existence aliens OR flying saucers, then he wouldn't believe in God, because he doesn't have physical ev idence to prove God exists either. I have physical evidence proving the existence of flying saucers in the form of my Peiltochterkompass. Vicki Landrum and compan y had physical evidence in the form of their burns and symptoms of radiation si ckness, corroborated by the government's admissions. The argument that the Klass ilk will never make, is that flying saucers are exclusively man-made electro-propulsive sh ips, and that the alien scenario is an orchestrated Secret Government fraud. 21 John Spencer, The U.F.O.

Taking Davidson on his face, he is incapable of discerning subtleties, and is a dupe of the pseudo-rational, polarized th inking of the Klass ilk, though I find it hard to believe that a 'scientist' coul d be so naive, or worse, stupid None of this incessant propaganda deserves to be dignified by a direct response, or slightest iota of credibility. I am using sp ecific types of hoaxes as examples of the design format and method for their implementation. Each of these hoaxes (such as Ken Rommel's New Mexico cattle mutilations pseudo-study), becomes \"documentation\" for other hoaxes, ad infinitum, thus eventua lly building up a massive 'preponderance' of phony \"evidence\" to back up one or the othe r of the two sides of the phony fight. When the fight dies down, they do something to stir it back up. The hoaxes contain mixtures of fact and fiction. The fiction is used to misrepresent the facts, while the facts are misrepresented as fictions, so th at the Secret Government alwa ys \"wins\" in the minds of pseudo-rational people. The two hoax counterparts are compliment ary. The frantically defensive, paranoid and mystical posture of the a lien-abductions huxters is designed to attract the Adamsky Psychophants and invite the ridicule of the Klass Psychophants, whose posture is designed to attract sadistic bullies and residual pseudo-skeptics, who taunt and incite the paranoia of the nuts even more. The overall ef fect is to alienate reasonable people from the debate, or to obliterate any appeal to sanity. The pseudo-skeptic dupes pretend to represent sanity, by 'blindly denying wh at any damned fool can plainly see'. The Fire in the Sky story is a double hoax—a \"hoax within a hoax\"—like the Roswell hoax. The \"alien\" huxters and thei r news writers, on one side of the hoax, 'versus' the protagonists of the pseudo -rational Klass class, and their news writers—such as Keay Davidson, in this article—on the other side of the hoax, are counterparts to the same hoax. Whether witting liars or gullible dupes, everyone is used to create two deep ruts adjacent to one anot her, with no room between for rationality or truth. Both the initially bungled Roswell and Fire hoaxes were much later revised, one as the \"MJ-12\" hoax, and the other as the \"Fire in the Sky\" hoax. Originally, after Walton was rescued by the flying saucer crew, the government decided to turn the emergency into a hoax—pursuant to a polic y already in effect—during which Walton got out of hand, saw more than he was suppose d to see, and revealed most of it in his initial 1975 press, radio and magazine inverv iews. This caused more harm than good to the intended hoax, so it backfired. This explains the 17-year silence before the \"Fire in the Sky\" patch-up job (they figured, how may people would have file s so old?), similar to the 38-year lapse between the Roswell hoax and the MJ-12 hoax. The second (Fire) hoax involved Walton's witting participation—enticed by a movie—ignoring his earlier interviews, and used new lies designed to cover up critical facts inadvertently made known to and re vealed by Walton in 1975, concerning his free-lance excursion from the infirmary and through the training base facility, including the flight simulator and hanger areas, while in a semi-violent and drugged-up stupor. 22 George Smoot and Keay Davidson, Wrinkles in Time [1993].

The mass audiences of movies and T. V. are relied upon to stamp out rationality. Davidson's sole basis for al leging fraud by Walton, was th e fact that NBC's The UFO Incident (the Betty and Barney Hill fabrica tion) was premiered only two weeks prior to the Walton incident (another government fraud), which only proved that the government was already aggressively impl ementing the abductions format, as borne out by Travis Walton's experiences. Only this could expl ain why the government hucksters already had their \"costumes\" and \"script\" ready to go at the time of the Travis Walton incident. Despite the lies, the facts show: 1. That Walton was injured in 1975, by electrical discharges from a saucer (similar to Vicki Landrum, Colby Lee Landrum, and Betty Cash in 1982), causing his fall and concussion; and, 2. that the injured Walton was rescued a nd given emergency medical treatment at the secret saucer base infirmary; and, 3. that during this treatment, Walton wa s exposed to an \"alien play\" enacted by government personnel, in a corny hoax intended to prepare him for later use as a \"witness\"; and, 4. that due to the leakage of critical facts, the government eventually paid Walton to lie pursuant to still another hoax, intended to obliterate the original facts of the 17-year-old bungled hoax, and to homogeni ze the hoax with the newly implemented \"abductions\" format. Since there are now many more saucers in use than ever before, more incidents are inevitable. The need for more 'streamlined' hoaxes has resulted in a new wave of government-funded hoaxes. The abductio ns hoaxes have emerged as the most convenient, since the new age movement has provided an almost endless supply of hypocritical 'spiritualists', willing to lie and fantasize their sexual indiscretions, hallucinations, and nightmares, etc., into \"abduction experiences\", at $50,000 a whack.

Here was a case where the Secret Government's \"special effects\" ante dated Hollywood's by 10 to 15 years. According to McKinney's expert documentation, the Government's special effects have at least caught up with Hollywood's, since the amateurish first attempts made during the Roswell Rhesus Monkey Hoax, and she further stated: \"Having been given no reason to believe otherwise, I have personally concluded that so-called UFO abductions, and the events surrounding those abductions and sightings, are a \"black\" intelligence operation, involvin g government-sponsored kidnappings, experimental drugs, surgic al experimentation, sophi sticated electronics and directed-energy technologies, implantabl e micro circuited devices, experimental aircraft, Hollywood-style special effects, and the exploitation of so-called 'abductees' as sources of ova, sperm and aborted fetuses for use in government-sponsored genetics experiments\". Then, on the issue of \"Hollywood\", I am certain that the Secret Government controls a lot of the movie business. In late 1974,1 was offered a c hoice of two parts in an Italian movie being shot at Cinnecitta in Rome, about the downfall of the Allende government in Chile, and the part played by the CIA in its overthrow. The movie was supposedly produced by the P.C.I. (Partito Communisti Italiano) and directed by 'Communist' director Giuseppe Ferrarri. Th e movie was covertly produced by the CIA, which was behind securing the part for me. The other part went to American actor, John Kellogg. 1 walked away and did not do the part, since my complicity would have indebted me to the CIA. What better way to control the opposition, than to lead it? 99.9% of the audience have never dreamed there could be government backing for such movies as Fire in the Sky, somethi ng Davidson could admit only if he were not a witting agent. As a Klass psychophant, he not only pseudo-debunked the movie, but used the occasion to lay the blame for th e OSI-created hoax—along with the news media's laziness, stupidity, and prostituti on (using as an example Oliver Stone's excellent movie J.F.K.)—on \"Hollywood\". While many of the news media and Hollywood are undeniably on the take from th e Secret Government, Jim Garrison and Oliver Stone—neither of whom sold out to anyone—weathered horrible harassment, and survived to valiantly debunk the Secret Go vernment's hoax concerning the murder of J.F.K., which reflected heavily on the manipul ation of party-liners like Davidson, the usual fascist liars who created obstacles to getting to the bottom of Kennedy's death. Some news writers seek to endear themse lves to the Secret Government, attacking the good, the brave, and the true, from among the safe ranks of the evil, the cowardly, and the false, who parrot the Secret Gove rnment's favorite lies. Keay Davidson's \"scoop\" was already stale \"canned corn\" fro m the Secret Government's officially approved menu. Where is \"scepticism\", the spirit of courageous investigative journalism?

This mass-p sychology propaganda preys upon ignorance, superstition, psychosis, and neurosis, and gathers, encourages, and organizes mass paranoia and delusions.

The CIA (the \"devil\" ) calls this \"recruiting\", and asks each new prospect, \"What is the price of your mind?\" The choice of seedy people is obviously an appeal to the lowest common social denominator—a sort of \"affirmative action for the tacky\"—emphasizing \"emotions\", \"feelings\", \"the heart\", and \"f aith\", etc. ad vomitus, en ticing emotionally unbalanced, pathetic people, who need help in tieing their own shoes. This induces already helpless people to stay right where they are, rather than strengthening their use of minds and resources in constructive ways.

It is hereby agreed and unders tood that these plans are hypothetical, provided only for the purpose of the investigation and understanding of flying saucer theory, flight and cons truction, and that the author gives no warranty, either express or implied, that a flying saucer constructed according to these plans will work or be safe to the operator or others. A. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS First, it is recommended that a flying model be built and tested before proceeding further, as it would be very disappointing to build an elaborate saucer which doesn't work. The fundamental principle is simp le: to electromagnetically synthesize momentum, employing a high voltage D.C. brus h discharge, in the direction of desired acceleration, to draw in and cause the exchange of ether carriers, which also brings in the tubes of electrical force, and to cause the tube s to dissolve in the conductors of the ship, which imparts momentum to the conductors, at 90 degrees to the electric current and magnetic inductance. In order to facilitate the dissolution of the tubes of force, an alternating current of sufficiently high freque ncy is utilized on the opposite end of the ship, to compress and block the ether carriers and tubes of force, so that they cannot pass out the rear, and are thereby forced to dissolve to impart momentum in the opposite direction. The hull should be accelerated, creating electromagnetic momentum in the desired direction almo st instantaneously. A Tesla coil is used to create a negative D. C. brush discharge on one electrode, and another Tesla coil is used on the opposite electrode, to create an A.C. high frequency, which compresses the ether carriers and tubes of force, and blocks their passage. These two electrodes comprise a \"p2\"—two different primaries—one—the D.C. brush— which draws in the tubes of force, and th e other—the A.C. current—which blocks the ether carriers and forces the tubes of fo rce to dissolve. The D.C. brush produces \"negative (\"hairy\") corona\", and the high frequency A.C. produces \"positive (\"cloudy\") ALIENS 195"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"corona\". It is believed that this system not only creates instant momentum in the direction of the D.C. brush, but eliminates the problem of inertia in the direction of the A.C. high frequency current, so that the rate of acceleration is virtually unlimited, and the destructive effect of acceleration is eliminated, since all parts of the ship and its contents accelerate at the same rate, without iner tia. This also applies to instant turns, in which the force of acceleration acts on all part s of the ship and its contents, to re-orient the force of momentum on each atom and molecule, in the new direction, eliminating centrifugal force. The kind of ship shown by these plans however, is of what I call the \"linear type\", which turns in a curving path , rather than in sharp angles, because this type of ship is easier to construct and control. In order to properly control the currents from the Tesla coils, specially designed switches, relays, capacitors, di electrics, inductors and conductors are required. In these hypothetical plans, I provide my own desi gn, which could conceivably be built by a skilled home craftsman. I also describe what I believe to be a control system which will be practical, reliable, and easy to construct, probably similar to what Tesla used on his \"Flivver\" machine, his manned, electro- propulsive ship of the earliest type. 1. SIZE AND SHAPE Since this ship is to be of the simplest type, it is no larger than required for one or two people. It is designed to be as small as possible, yet to have the necessary equipment and space for comfort. The general shape of the craft can be described as an oblate spheroid, the shape of a moving \"point char ge\" system. The first manned ship built by Tesla was described as the approximate size and shape of a \"gas stove\", which would be a sort of long, rectangular box on legs. The le gs were presumably stand-off insulators so the craft could get off the ground. I assume that it was of the linear type, with Tesla crouched inside, perhaps on some sort of support, which allowed his hands to be free for the controls, with his head pointed toward a small window at one end. Electromagnets on the \"front\", with switching and polarity provi sions to divert the brush to the right or left, would allow for complete control, with the 'buoyancy' control determining altitude. The bottom and rear would be activated by th e high frequency A.C. blocking current. If Tesla wanted to turn right, he would use the electromagnets to divert the brush so that the right corner was pulled, as the air pressu re would cause the ship to swing around in a circular turn. To go down, all he had to do was to diminish the current to the top brush. Since the most efficient application of elec trical energy is de sired, to conserve energy and to transmit the respective prop ulsive force effectively, with the least expenditure of energy, it is recommended to use rounded surfaces, si milar to the design of electrostatic generators, the design of corona rings, or the design used by Tesla in his Wardenclyffe Tower electrodes—rather than sharp points, shapes, or edges—which tend to cause \"point discharge\", the wasteful and uncoordinated leakage of electric charges into space in a manner which is unproductive. Since the primary function is to get the ship off the ground and to remain stable while hovering, the upper surface area is generally a horizontal surface, but is spheroidally curved and somewhat symmetrical. I call the electrode from which a brush discharge is emitted at the center top of the ship, the \"buoyancy electrode\". This electrode is used at almost all times during flight, in addition to an electrode which may be activated at the front of the ship, to cause horizontal acceleration and to turn the ship.

There is always an \"equal and opposite\" reaction. In order for th ere to be a \"reaction\", there must be a \"disturbance to the equilibrium\". As the ether carriers continue to exchange, bringing in the tubes of force, there is nothing to preven t them from passing out the other end of the ship, so that there would be no \"reaction\", and the ship would acquire no momentum. As Tesla said, the A.C. current (at the rear and bottom of the ship), when of \"sufficiently high frequency\", will draw ether carriers and tubes of force to itself, until they are so compressed that no further action will occur. This is apparently intended to \"block\" the field of gravity and to block inertia—like Dr. Cavour's 'door', painted with \"Cavourite-- -and to force the tubes of force in the ship 's forward conductors to dissolve, so that momentum is imparted to the conductors (and th e ship to which they are attached), as J. J. Thomson said. 2. POWER SYSTEM One of Tesla's patents, Method for Signa ling, Patent No. 723,188, which has the two primaries marked as \"p 1 \"and \"p 2 \"—possibly the origin of the title \"p2\" given to the 1935-38 New Mexico project run by von Braun—shows an oscillator system having two separate pancake-coils, tuned differently, running off a common rotary spark gap and dynamo. A copy of a drawing from that patent follows: If one coil is tuned to one quarter wavelength, and the other to a full wavelength, they would comprise a D.C. brush circuit and a high frequency A.C. circuit, respectively. The A.C. circuit could be run at all times on the bottom and rear, with the brush being activated at the top to lift off, an d to the front to go forward or turn.

Two conduits supply air and gas, respectively, to the firing chamber (second turbine): The second edition of Free Energy Surprise, wh en issued, will include my complete set of plans, redesigned, to be constructed us ing basic machine tools for the home builder. ALIENS 198"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"The turbine shown will produ ce at least 30 break horsepo wer and operate at about 30,000 rpm., and should weigh no more than ten pounds, including the valvular conduits and firing chamber. The firing chamber has a glow plug (the kind used in model airplane engines), and fires in a \"reverberatory\" way (the explos ions come in rapid succession), producing a continuous supply of expanding hot gases, whic h enter the turbine on its outer edge as shown, and spiral between the disks toward the vents which are near the center shaft. I have routed the exhaust out one side of the turbine, through a single exhaust vent, rather than out both sides as Tesla did, to dimini sh turbulence, and to free one side of the turbine for the bearing mount and connecti on to the gearbox and mounting plate. The exploding gases will not blow back through the valvular conduit, which was Tesla's valve system having no moving parts, and will continue to move into the turbine inlet vent, as the combustion chamber continues to produce the pressurized gases. Judging from the fact that the turbine will produce 30 hp on 125 lbs. steam, it should produce more horsepower on propane or gasoline, and should be adequate. For the generator, I recommend a heavy duty high amperage automotive alternator, such as the type used on heavy equipment, or a high output, lightweight alternator designed for power generators, normally having an engine of about 30 hp. It will be necessary to use step-down geari ng to reduce the speed of the turbine, so that, at the optimum (most efficient) operating rpm of the turbine (about 25,000 rpm), it will be stepped down to the optimum operati ng rpm recommended for the alternator. For example, if the alternator is to run at 1,200 rpm., and the turbine at 25,000 rpm., the gearing would have to function at a 20:1 ra tio. A battery will also be required to supply the appropriate exciter voltage, and to store electrical energy for appliances and other necessary on-demand current. Only herringbon e gears should be us ed in the gearbox. By using an unrectified A.C. current from the alternator, it should be possible to route it directly into the high voltage transformer, with a variac to regulate it. For example, if the alternator produces three cy cles per revolution, at 1,200 rpm., it would produce the approximate 60 cycle current fo r the high voltage transformer. The high voltage transformer(s) should be capable of producing a high amperage output commensurate to the horsepower of the turbine. A neon light transformer, producing .030 amps at 15 kv., would amount to only 450 watts in the secondary, for a generator which could produce 45 kw or more. To be on the safe side, you should use transformers for each pancake module which have high volta ge ratings of at least 5 kw in their secondaries (totalling almost 50% of the altern ator's capacity). I can't imagine that this system would be inadequate. This would be enough power to run about 50 Tesla coils of the powerful types which I have run off the neon light transformers. 3. HIGH VOLTAGE D.C. BRUSH DISCHARGE The high voltage D.C. brush discharge allo ws equal exchange of the electric and magnetic tubes of force in oppos ite directions. The Tesla coil is tuned to one-quarter wavelength, emitting negative pulses which are so rapid that the current continues to flow in the secondary, during current reversals in the primary. This steady D.C, \"pseudo-electrostatic\" brush di scharge has a greater effect on the independent ether carriers, and 'rarifies' them, exerting an elasti c, pulling force in the space in front of the ship. This induces the rapid exchange of th e ether carriers through the front of the ship, ALIENS 199"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"and draws the tubes of force into the conduc tor. In the D.C., secondary conductor, the tubes of force have nowhere to go, and are forced to dissolve, as new tubes of force continue to be brought in. Th is imparts momentum to the conductor, which must be firmly attached to the ship. The thing which makes the tuned Tesla coil the ideal contrivance for this purpose, is the fact that the principles of high frequency inductance make it possible to create very high D.C. potential s, using a relatively small coil, which may be placed flat against the walls of the ship, powered by a compact al ternator. This eliminates the need for the large and cumbersome parts of an electros tatic generator, which would produce only a fraction of the amperage of the Tesla coil, and a greatly diminished exchange of the ether carriers and influx of tubes of force. It has also been shown that a D.C. pulse produces a greater effect in Hall effect pumping than a steady D.C. current. 25 The negative D.C. pulse discharges will leave the inside of a closed hollow conductive vessel—such as a saucer is—and ap pear on its outer surface, as Michael Faraday discovered, which conveniently protects the pilot, crew and internal contents of the saucer from the effect s of electrostatic charges. 4. HIGH VOLTAGE, HIGH FREQUENCY A.C. CURRENT The high frequency current, required to bl ock the exchange of ether carriers and passage of the tubes of force through the rear of the ship, behaves with a \"skin effect\", which means it travels over the surface atoms (the \"skin\"), rather than through the internal mass of the conductor, as well as the skin of other solid conductive bodies. This phenomenon also provides some convenient protection for crew members from the effects of this type current. Aside from the phenomenon of the skin effect of high frequency alternating current, internal circui ts must be highly insulated and shielded where necessary, with care given to shielding of the pilot (and crew or passenger) from possible high voltage radiation dangers. The pancake-type coils have a higher thre shold for arcing at a given voltage than cylindrical or conical ones, which makes them best for these very high voltage applications. Care must be take n at all times, in the design of high voltage circuits, that the close proximity of conductors having high opposite potentials is avoided, and sufficiently insulated and sp aced where necessary. Silicone rubber, transformer oil, Formica, and plexiglass are good insulators, an d there is a dielectric paste which is excellent. There is a tendency for the air close to the conductors to become ionized, creating pathways for the current to leak and arc through space to other conductors of opposite potential, whenever within ra nge, roughly governed by the parameters of 20 kv/cm., at sea level pressure, adjusted downward for higher altitude and correspondingly lower pressure, which requires that the space be increased for the same difference in potential. Internal high voltage corona leakage and arcing between conductors, components or contacts, can be suppre ssed by use of pressurized inert gas environments, increased air or gas pressures, solid, rubber, plastic, oil, or paste insulators of hi gh dielectric strength. 25 Beckman Instruments, Inc., Hall Effect Manual, Helipot Division, Fullerton, California.

VERTICAL ASCENT AND DESCENT Due to the tremendous superiority of th e electrical attractive force over the gravitational and aerodynamic forces, it should be possible to fly a saucer with a greatly diminished electric power system, but the saucer's control is a very sensitive matter, requiring the ability to activate the appropriate electrodes rapidly, in response to a need to change directions of movement, or to quickly correct inappropriate movements of the ship, because of its great speed and ability to \"jump around\" without inertial/momentive resistance. The main buoyancy coil, mounted in an area above the cabin, provides the negative brush discharge, which, when paired with the high frequency A.C. coil, beneath the cabin floor, accelerates the ship upward, as th e force is balanced to maintain the saucer at a particular vertical position. The high frequency current used on the bottom of the ship on hovering, seems to be the equivalent to Dr. Cavour's \"door\", which when shut, stops the gravitational effects from forcin g the ship to accelerate toward the earth. The description in 19th century physics lite rature, as I documented in Occult Ether Physics (especially the 2nd Edition), implie s that a normal gravitating body moving relative to earth, within earth 's electric, magnetic and gravitational fields, naturally draws the tubes of force into itself, where they are dissolved to impart momentum. The downward movement of the saucer can be effected by allowing it to drop by the force of gravity, with power diminished, t hough it can be effected more rapidly by a reversal of the forces which accelerate it upward, but, to eliminate unnecessary complexity and danger, I don't recommend this for a prototype. The discharge electrodes shown in these pl ans are of the \"pancake-coil\" type, which can be placed parallel to the interior walls of the ship, and will be the recipient of the momentum, which is imparted on the third axis, perpendicular to the flat side of the coil, at 90 degrees to the other two axes, which are the magnetic inductance and electric current axes. Placing the flat coils parallel to the outer walls will therefore orient the momentum perpendicular to the outer surface of the ship. 6. HORIZONTAL TRAVEL Horizontal travel is effected by a pairing, along the ship's longitudinal axis, of the two electrodes, the D.C. brush at the front , and the high frequency A.C. current to the rear. It was believed at one time, by Heinrich Hertz 25 , that two systems of varying current should exert a ponderomotive force on each other due to their variations, but Tesla proved that the \"ponderomotive force\" is due to the respective rarefaction and compression of the ether carriers, produced by different kinds of currents (D.C, A.C, and rapidly varying electrostatic forces) 26 , and their effects on the ether. 25 Ann. d Phys. xxxi [ 1887], p. 421; Hertz's Electr ic Waves, translated by D.E.

ALIENS201"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"B. CONSTRUCTION OF THE HULL Due to the magnitude by which the electrical attractive force is greater than the gravitational attractive force, tremendous stre ss is created on the hull of a saucer, which must therefore be constructed very strongly. While a spherical shap e readily lends itself to such requirements, internal structuri ng members and walls should be designed, constructed and positioned for maximum rigid ity and strength, to prevent the possible pulling apart of, or crumpling of the hull, as this would be the supreme misfortune. Construction of entrance and exit ports and other such contrivances, should anticipate powerful stresses, since openings are generally points of weakness. It is desirable that the hull have a smooth and co ntinuous conductive outer surface, which has little or no small diameter protuberances, a nd as few weak or \"blank\" spots in it as possible, caused by such things as windows (See \"C. Simplified Drawings and Plans\" below for available excellent source of tech nical construction literature with materials suppliers). Windows must be of strong , thick material, firmly attached. 1. POWER PLANT Since the electrical attractive force is so much greater than the gravitational attractive force, it is logical that a relatively small engine, such as the Tesla turbine, or a snowmobile or motorcycle engine, would be adequate to power an alternator of sufficient power for this size saucer. Tesla designed his tiny turbines and remarkable high frequency alternators for this purpose, and they would be preferable. An independent air intake and e xhaust system, separate from the air supply for the cabin, must be provided, with careful attention to preclude the mi xture of exhaust gases with the air supply for crew and pilo t. Batteries may be sufficient to supply electrical power for a saucer, with a small engine used peri odically to recharge the battery system, as needed. As shown below in \"Special S upplementary Notation on the WW II German Flying Saucers\", construction of manned, 'hot-rod'-type saucers or spheres, perhaps only four feet in diameter, may be feasi ble, possibly using automotive spark coils (perhaps similar to some of the \"foo fight ers\" seen and photographed by allied bomber gunnery crews, in the skies of WW II Ge rmany). The atmospheric nitrogen-oxygen combustion system invented by Tesla, for the production of electrical energy from the air, is too complex to be cove red here, and there is insufficient information as to just exactly how the system was constructed and used to produce useful energy. 2. SEATING AND VISIBILITY Ultra-light, strong, fiberglass bucket seats with seat belts, are recommended. The closer the pilot's eyes to the windshield, the smaller the windows required for visibility, with care taken to electrically insulate th e pilot's head from the ceiling. A spherical shape will provide better visibi lity than a 'discus' shape, an d a wide-angle optical viewer might be provided directly downward, between a solo pilot's legs, if desired. This type of saucer involves a restricted pilot position, but since the saucer is so fast, satisfying flights, over great distances, should be of short duration. Small video cameras such as those often used on race cars or by skiers, having wide angle lens es, might be mounted in the saucer surface, with view screen s around the interior of the cabin.

FLIGHT SUIT The flight suit should provide electrical and heat insulation, with ultraviolet protection for the eyes. An insulated, cold-water wet suit might work well. Since a pilot will be looking out ports which are near the hull surface, the helmet should provide extra thick electrical insulation, to prevent arcing or electric shock to the head. In general, the suit should provide U.V. radiation protection, preferably by use of a special plastic already developed for this purpose. (NOTE: It was rumored early in the program, in the '50s, that only women pilots were used, sinc e the male scrotal cavity is particularly sensitive to the electrical radiation problems of the saucers.) Ironically, the kind of pull-over headgear, us ed by actors or pilots, often used to fake the appearances of \"aliens\", might be an ideal design for a saucer pilot's headgear, with thick layers of foam insulation in the top (representing the bulbous brain cavities often depicted on the phony aliens), and th e sunglass-lens eyes covers would provide U.V. protection.

The skilled experimenter will also recognize that there are relatively simple me thods for construction of a scientifically adequate, test scale model, and only a fool would embark on such a project without making such a test, with care taken to insure that the model is suspended by insulative string running through pullies, so that the po wer may not drain to ground. Such details of saucer construction as particular metals and other materials, fabrication and technology, are generally omitted from these pl ans, since a complete, detailed set of working drawings, with accompanying technica l literature, could conceivably require ten times the length of this book.

Aluminum, though light, may not be the best metal, because there are so many bonding problems with the metal. I am recommending stainless steel, since the electromagnetic flux used to divert the brush discharge for turning must be able to pass through the outer shell. 28 Andrew C.

(Special Supplementary Notations on The WWII German Fl ying Saucers): In this short summary, I will avoid suspected misinformation, or material which is unrealistically speculative. There were purportedly several inventors working in Nazi Germany on various types of flying saucers, not all of which we re electro-propulsive in concept, meant to operate on rocket, jet, turbojet, or prop-driven reactions of the aerodynamic type. All the video or literary material available to me , concerned this \"aerodynamic\" type, were either misinformational, or gr ossly ill-conceived \"science\" of the La La Land variety, seeming to be mostly contemporary Austri an new age 'thinking' or CIA-concocted garbage, containing only grains of truth. For example, there seems to be valid documentation concerning one example, th e Habermohl \"Pflugerad\" (\"Flying Wheel\")-- -which was little more than a re-designed gyrocopter—which actually may have gotten off the ground, though even in the supposed 'documents', was said to be unstable and dangerous to fly. It combined a gyrocopt er or helicopter rotor in a wheel shape, concentrically rotating around a ball-shaped cockpit. It experien ced several crashes during tests, probably because the rotor gave it too much gyrostability, so that it was unmaneuverable, there being no way to d ecouple the rotor/gy ro from the airframe, during turns or changes in attitude. Some models showed a vertical stabilizer and rudder on the rear of the central non-rotating cockpit sect ion, to turn it in the direction of flight. A rather good idea later used on \"jet copters\" , was rocket or jet engines attached to the rotor, which eliminated the torque problem normally encountered with shaft-driven rotors. The inertial guidance system (\"Peiltochterkompass\", or \"polar slave compass\") was built to meet the requirements of the \"fu ll electric\" \"Kreisel Teller\" , because the electrostatic \"Faraday cage\" effect creat ed by its propulsion system made a normal compass worthless, and the high speeds (c . 9,000 m.p.h.), zig-zag maneuverability, precession, and poor visibility created navigationa l problems which re quired a special, non-magnetic compass. The Peiltochterkompass was coupled to a \"Meisterkreiselkompass\" (\"master gyro compass\") mounted on gimbals, which generated its own angular momentum, and oper ated independent to the earth's gravity and the ship's momentum or inertia. This w ould be true even if the saucer externally cancelled the effects of gravity, inertia and momentum since, just as the sun transfers momentum to the earth by electrical current, the saucer power system transfers angular momentum to the gyro. Moving freely on its gimbals, the master gyrocompass pointed in the same direction all the time, no matter which way the ship turned, held into position by its angular momentum, as the motor on th e slave compass was actuated when needed to turn the compass indicator dial in the direction of travel. This book is the only known documentati on concerning the \"KT-p2\" project, which from my analysis appeared to be the only tr ue electro-propulsive sa ucer, and hence true \"UFO\" possessed by the Germans. In reitera tion, any other kind of \"saucer\" is not a \"saucer\" at all, but only some sort of je t, rocket, or fan-driven plane, which by coincidence was only shaped like a saucer. There is nothing inherent in the \"saucer\" shape which makes it particularly advantageous over a conventional aircraft, and in most ALIENS204"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"cases, is a disadvantage, except in the contex t of electro-propulsion only, and this only if it is desired to have instant 360-degree mane uverability. The \"saucer\" projects carried out in Czechoslovakia were cl early disinformational, given the fact that von Braun had the electro-propulsive type as early as 1936 by my documentation. This has come as an embarrassment to those who have put so mu ch stock in the so-called \"S.S. documents from Wiener Neustadt\", which came under the ju risdiction of the CIA and were therefore misinformational. It would be wise of you to observe who among the \"UFOlogy\" network has been first to make so much of these documents, as well as who among them have been suckered in by them. It is likely th at true saucers were available at the Wiener Neustadt base of General Otto Skorzeny, but were not as described in the tampered literature. It appears that the O.S.I. prepared the disinformation, and disseminated it with the help of Skorzeny, who was one of the firs t to make such deals to stay out of jail. Skorzeny was also crafty enough to conceal several stashes of high tech documentation and plans, so that he could coerce either the Soviets or the Allies into giving him the protection he desired. The O.S.I. directed attention to the misinformation, through UFOlogy channels, just in time to anticipat e my book. Many suckers fail to realize that all German saucer materials had already fallen under the jurisdiction of the CIA O.S.S.), even before the armistice. One writer/speaker has attempted to disti nguish between \"sauce rs of the secret societies\", and \"saucers which were secr et weapons of the Third Reich\". What is secret\" is secret, and the fact that the electro-propulsive saucers were used by the Third Reich in its air defenses meant that the \" secret societies\" scenario is only a fantasy ncouraged by the CIA, while the Gestapo clearly could qualify as a \"secret society\". How secret can it get? My ma terial is obviously mo re secret than th e Wiener Neustadt stuff, and I had no help from the \"Knights Te mplars\" or anyone el se, and have had to fight tooth and nail all the way to the day my first edition was finally published, and am still struggling. Most of my analysis of th e saucer's propulsion system was extrapolated from my 1953 sighting, confirmed by what I ha ve learned from my Peiltochterkompass. In the years since the publis hing of my first edition, read by many engineers and scientists, some of whom are experts on Ge rman aircraft of all kinds, no one has produced any mention of a \"Peiltochterkompa ss\" or the \"KT-p2 Projekt\", from another German source or any other. This alone pr oves the German \"documentation\" has been tampered with, because of the conspicuou s omission of this important project. From these facts, it is my assessment that the so-called \"S.S. documents\" are either complete fakes, or have been seriously tampered with for misinformational purposes. For example, one type of German ship is referred to in the documents by the name \"Kraut Meteor\". Despite the fact that this was sometimes how the Allies referred to it on occasion, the Germans wouldn' t have called it that in their own documents, which would be tantamount to Idi Amin Dada build ing an aircraft, and calling it the \"Nigger Watermelon\". I very seriously doubt that Hitl er would have permitted the use of such derogatory and \"decadent\" American slang to name a supposed 'super aircraft' of the Third Reich. Having already been suckered in once by some of this material, I won't do it again, and I urge extreme caution in accept ing and repeating this material, unless you want to be made a sucker out of. Recently, I was contacted by a California person who sent me a copy of W.A. Harbison's book, Inception (Dell, 1991). He was under the impressi on that Harbison's book had pre-empted mine. Not so. Harbison's book not only was fiction (and very ALIENS205"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"interesting at that), but was based on th e misconception that \"German\" flying saucers were the first ones, that they used an aerodynamic \"boundary layer\" air propulsion system purportedly invented by a fictitious American named John Wilson, and that the saucers we see today are headquartered out of an elaborate underg round city built under the ice of Antarctica, run by the S.S. an d worked by slave la bor. Boundary-layer \"saucers\" would not be true \"flying saucer s\", but would only be unusual \"air-planes\" shaped like flying saucers. As proven by my Peiltochterkompass and my sightings and documentation, the German saucers were electro- propulsive Tesla craft (requiri ng an inertial navigation system, because of the high-voltage electrost atic discharges and \"Faraday cage\" effects), some of which had 360-degree peripheral mane uverability in 30-degree increments, just as I observed between 1947-53, in the night skies of West Texas. The purported Schauberger ships (the only information we really have are photos of models built by Felix Schauberger), purportedly built in Czechoslovakia, were supposedly designed to use an \"implosion turb ine\" to generate the power to drive an 'air-blower' intended to propel the ship. As such, it was little more than a (flying?) air conditioning vent, with an unusual engine, an d couldn't have gotten off the ground. And even if by some miracle it could have go tten off the ground, it couldn't have gone over 300 m.p.h., with the dumpy design, much less over 1,000 m.p.h. as claimed by misinformationists, especially since there is not even reliable information that the ship was ever built. It is too easy to say \"the Ru ssians got it\", and even if it had been built and had flown, it wouldn't be worth classifying, any more than the little engine-powered UFO toys, which at least were more feasible, and are known to actually fly. There was purportedly a ship designed by Miethe said to be powered by 12 BMW engines—claimed in document s to run on helium—but said to use the \"boundary layer\" aerodynamics of Prandtl. Such a system, if true, automatically ruled out electro- propulsive ships. It is my belief that if any of the photos are partially real, the purported name and propulsion system were misrepresented, to throw investigators off the possibility of electro-propulsive ships. Ther e is a photo (real or fake?) purporting to show Miethe explaining this type to Hitler on Apr. 7, 1944. It was purportedly tested in November, 1943, which would be only one month after the manufac ture date of my Peiltochterkompass, which raises a probabil ity against mere coincidence. For that reason, I believe that some of the photos—but not the usual 'technical descriptions'—of these ships, may be genuine. The drawings of the basic internal structures may also be somewhat accurate, disregarding the misinter pretations given to them. Large, round ball shapes are shown in the drawings, and thr ee of these are shown in the large \"mother ships\" (what I call \"flying submarines\"). Th ese ball shapes could have been liquid helium fuel tanks. A \"helium power\" system could run \"BMW engines\", as shown by the Papp engine shown in the Appendices. Twelve engines would suggest that each engine drove a separate electrical generator around the periphery of the saucer, which is consistent with the Peiltochterkompass desi gn. The \"Miethe saucer\" could be from the \"KT-p2 Projekt\", the particulars (name, power system, etc.) having been obliterated and faked with misinformation. Though labels and nomenclatures of drawings allegedly from Wiener Neustadt appear to have been altered—especially the written documents alleged to have been with them, which contain silly language—some of the physical designs makes sense in terms of electro-pr opulsive ships, when \"corrected\" by my material. One sketch shows a manned \"Flying Turtle\", which is very similar to the ones I ALIENS206"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"saw in the WW II 8th A.F. film taken by a B-17 bomber crew. I saw this film while a member of the 26th Strategic Reconnaissanc e Wing, Operations Intelligence Division, Strategic Air Command, Lockbourne, A.F.B., Oh io, in late 1957. We viewed the film with other intelligence personnel, several of whom had participated in the actual bombing raids in which the film was shot. My O.I.C., Lt. Col. Edward R. Jirles, was involved with Operation Paperclip, as he wa s among the first Army C.I.C. personnel in the Rheinland. In fact, he was responsib le for hunting down and bringing in the \"Werewolves\"—the last fanatical holdouts of the S.S.—for S.E.A.T.O. Capt. Weismann still carried 9 pieces of shrapnel in his body which he received as one of the heroes who bombed the Ploesti oil fields in Romania, and was sufficiently recuperated in time to be aboard a bomber for the \"foo fighter\" incident s. Contrary to misinformation, the \"foo fighters\" were not radio-controlled, unmanne d craft, but were small electro-propulsive ships flown by pilots, probably Hitlerjugend. German daredevils apparently flew these things around the bombers to disrupt their electrical equipment and ignition systems, and to draw their fire. Disruption of the equipment would have required no spec ial equipment, since their dynamic electromagnetic fields and high frequency coro na would have rendered the desired effect on allied aircraft, just as one shut down the electrical system on my father's car in 1957, just outside Levelland, Texas. That ship was about 200 feet long and was egg shaped, similar to the Flying Turtles and to thos e seen by Lonnie Zamora near Soccorro, New Mexico. Since the \"Flying Turtle\" was perhaps the simplest of all the German types, I present a simplified set of hypothetical draw ings and plans for it. We have no complete, detailed photos or drawings of its design, other than the 8th A.F. films I saw in 1957, and a preliminary sketch from German sources, which I give partial credence to, and present for you with as good an interpretati on as possible. The advantage of the Flying Turtle was its good visibility, and its cheap, co mpact, one-man, simple \"hot rod\" design, audaciously sacrificing everything to function, to tear into the skie s and interfere with the horrible Allied \"fire-bombings\" that ki lled several hundred thousand civilians in the Hamburg and Dresden areas. Because of it s oblong (\"turtle-shell-shaped\") design, the control system on these craft appeared to be simplified, with electromagnets in front to turn the ship. The blast of the air was relied on to pull the ship into line as the force was applied, to get the desired maneuverability in the simplest and most direct way. This explains perfectly how the \"Foo Fighters\" were able to fly in a spiralling pathway. The truth of the air combat over Germany reveals heroic tales of young daredevils and wily old veterans, such as Adolf Galla nd, who not only flew with only one leg and one eye, but parachuted out of several shot- up Gustavs to return i mmediately to the sky to fight again, over and over, unti l there were no more planes to fly 29 . Many of Germany's pilots fought hard, well, valoro usly, and honorably to the bitter end. In the film I saw, in which the Flying Tur tles circled the B-17s helically, along their flight paths, the g unners were unable to shoot them because they moved so fast, although they appeared to hit some of the much slower Me-163 \"Komets\" (c. 500 m.p.h.) which accompanied the Flying Turtles. The Komets were cheaply built \"disposable ships\", abandoned in the sky on ce their rocket fuel was expended. In one shot, a Komet pilot could be seen bailing out. By comparison of both size and speed 29 Heinz Knocke, I Flew For the Fuehrer. ALIENS207"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"between the Komet and a Flying Turtle (moving more than twice as fast as the Komet), it was obvious that the central body of the Turt le was larger than the Komet's, and was going at least 1,000 m.p.h., in a helical path. This maneuver would be the result of the pilots simultaneous actuation of both the \"up\" and \"right\" modes, in typical \"joystick\" fashion. These ships must have required a lot of dexterity, like a video game or a skate board. The speed was no surprise to me, since the saucer I saw in 1953 (about 5 years before I saw the film) was going at least that fast when it did its 90-degree turns. Since my discovery of how Tesla controlled the brush discharge, to turn the craft, my plans show only one front electrode, with the \"buoyancy\" coils used to create the \"up\" and \"down\" movement. (Actually, an electro-propulsive ship could be flown with only one set of coils, by diverting the brush at the top to 'swing' the ship sideways \"pendulum\" fashion, but the speed would not be nearly so high.) Since the momentum is imparted to the conductor at 90 degrees to th e electric current and magnetic inductance, the flat, pancake types, which can be firmly imbedded inside the ship's shell, are ideal. One would be placed inside the hemispheri cal nose. A type of simple joy-stick— controlling the electromagnets to the two si des of the front coil—divert the brush discharge in the desired direction, as the body of the craft is swung around by the air to the corresponding curving pathway, turning the craft right, left, or straight ahead. Intelligence agencies have exerted tr emendous effort to obliterate the facts regarding combat reports of German flying sa ucers, even inducing fa lse reports of post- war German and Austrian \"new-age\" type rese archers, by feeding them misinformation. Some of the researchers even relied on in formation obtained from the FBI by FOIA procedures. They just can't get it th rough their heads, that NO CURRENTLY CLASSIFIED INFORMATION CAN BE OBTAINED BY A CITIZEN THROUGH THE FOIA. All such information has been \"screened out\". Released documents which (once) contained classified references have th e classified portions censored. That's what all those blacked out areas are, stupids! In addition, under the National Security Act, completely fabricated informat ion is often released through the FBI, under the FOIA, to mislead researchers who seek to discover classifi ed secrets. What better way to sucker in those who think that certain \"documents\" re leased by the FBI are necessarily valid? So-called 'technical' descriptions, accord ing to dupes or those who pretend to know, are downright stupid. For example, th e \"Feuerball\" (\"Fireball\") is described as being a 'circular' or 'spherical', remote-c ontrolled craft, from one to two meters in diameter, powered by a flat (radial) turbo- jet engine, which rotated the outer periphery around its axis, creating its \"glo wing\" appearance from the effects of the expulsion of \"over-rich\" jet exhaust, as it spun around. 30 Even more ridiculous, it contained a Klystron tube (developed around 1939 by the Varian brothers, for Sperry Gyroscope Company, in America), which pulsed synchronously with Allied radar, making it invisible to radar. 31 If stealth technology were so simple everyone would have it. These descriptions just don't cut the mustard. There was no way to make a remote- controlled device which did all the things reported, and the conspi cuous effort was to avoid the categories, \"electro-propul sive\" and \"manned flying saucers\". 30 Haarmann, D.

The ovoidal type, (or \"linear type\") which flew lengthwise, and included the \"Flying Turtles\", \"Mother Ships\", and \"egg-sh apes\" (which in some cases appeared to have more cylindrical shapes, like the \"cigar\" types, probably due to the necessity to use the most convenient means of fabric ation and control at the time); and, 2. the silvery disk type, which flew pe ripherally, such as the ones seen by my mother, with some alterations to produce the \"double-wok\" shape seen by us in 1953. There are some very close correlations between the alleged \"Vril\" ships and those seen by my mother and the entire personnel of the City Hall in Kermit, in 1950, and the ones seen by our entire family in 1953.1 have some friends who saw a ship similar to the Vril type (with a slot around its center), near Pecos, New Mexico a few years back.

The measly vents would have carried insufficient thrust, and the air friction would have literally burned up th e ship. Consistent with my mother's information from Roswell and Alamogordo friends in 1948, helium was probably used as fuel in the German KT-p2 ships, whic h is the probable reason the Zeppelin program was abandoned, since all the helium was need ed for flying saucer fuel. Besides, why have Zeppelins when you can have flying saucers, using similar construction techniques?

Recent Notes Regarding American UFOs In 1995, just after I had completed the ma nuscript for my second edition in August, an \"Aurora\" crashed and burned near La Luz, New Mexico, just to the north of Alamogordo and Holloman Air Force Base. This material developed too late for me to include in the second edition. Around five days after the crash, while at the intersection of Old Pecos Trail and Rodeo Road at the southeast corner of Sa nta Fe, I saw a gray, 'pug-nosed' stake bed truck which had exited 1-25 from the south, as it stopped at a light. It had a CIA license plate on the center front of its bumper. As it turned left to go west on Rodeo Road— which goes across the south side of Santa Fe—I noticed that it had a tarpaulin on its bed covering some debris. It went west to Cerri llos Road, turned north to Siler Road, then made a left down Siler, and took a right down a street leading to a recycling center which I often went to. There, it unloaded its 'salvage'. The following day, I examined the debr is, and even dissasssembled a component. The salvage included the following (drawn to the best of my recollection): ALIENS212"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"The debris was blackened from the burni ng, and someone had taken a sledge hammer to the dish, in attempt to deface it, but failed to break a single \"power-vac\". The entire assembly appeared to be a high-amperage switching system which carried 15.5 Kv current to two places at a time, totalling twelve in all, in bipolar pairs. This seemed to confirm the rumor that the \"Aurora\" could hov er and use \"UFO-like\" electro-propulsive technology, in addition to its normal turbojet power. It is interesting that the name \"Aurora\" is used for this craft, since the discoveries by Kristian Birkeland and Hannes Alfven, that the Aurora Borealis is a giant current from the sun into Earth's north pole, which tr ansfers angular momentum from the sun to the earth, and showed the relation to Tesla' s electro-propulsive te chnology and Dynamic Theory of Gravity.The principle was illustrated by the sighting made by myself and several others as I sat in a hot tub at the Ten Thousand Waves Japanese Bath House near Santa Fe, on the evening of Jan. 26, 1996 (illustrated on page 181). The brush discharge extended above and ahead of the ship as momentum was transferred to it from the ether carriers. The usual practice in handling debris from a crashed classified aircraft, such as the Aurora mentioned above, is to separate it and haul it to the four winds, using several salvage yards, to avoid detection or identi fication of the debris, but how could I have missed it with the CIA stakebed, only days after the Aurora crash, coming from the south, with a tarpaulin-covered pile of debris on its bed? Why didn't they just fire off flares to signal their arrival? Word apparently reached the CIA that I had examined the debris, since the salvage yard owner created some phony reasons to ban me from his yard. He said he had to play ball with the spooks, or they won't bring him any more salvage.

Since its circle was around 30 degrees across, its speed was around 2,000 mph. It was around 3/4\" long at arm's length, which means that it was around 400 feet long, about 250 feet wide, and appeared to be about 50 feet thick. In other words, the ship was about the size of a five-story building which occupied the shape of the area inside the track ar ound a football field. On July 19, 1998, 9:21 P.M., my son and I sighted a couple of huge, saucer-shaped ships, as we exited Furr 's Food Emporium, a large gro cery store on St. Michael's Drive, on the southeast side of Santa Fe. The ships were hovering and maneuvering between Santa Fe and the 'tec h' areas to the south of Lo s Alamos National Laboratory. Due to the apparent distance to these ships—at least five miles—and their relative size, they were very large, several hundred feet across. One ship hovered horizontally for a short time, while the other appeared to be hovering at an angle, showing its bottom, which had four large, red lights on it. The horizontal ship had a single row of red lights around its middle, in what appeared to be a trough. These round red lights, which had to be around five to ten feet in diameter, 'throbbed' in sequence, from left to right, beco ming bright then dim, one after the other. These were apparently to stabilize the ship's precession, and the fact that they 'throbbed'—increased and diminished gradually in power, rather than \"flashed\" abruptly—indicated that they smoothed out the transition of force from one electrode to another. This would produce a more stable effect to counteract the precession problem. The large lights each had a hexagonal, 'hon eycomb-like' pattern, indicating that they were composed of many smaller infra-red lights, each mounted in hexagonal frames. This was probably because of the difficulty in getting larger I.R. lights, and the fact that, even though one light might burn out, the others would remain to function until the burnt out lights could be replaced. The I.R. emissions seem to have the opposite effect on the brush as a magnetic field, inducing the brush to follow the beam to counteract its tendency to sp in, since the spinning creates th e precession when the ship is hovering. The I.R. lights are to stabilize th e ships. Here is a simplified drawing: ALIENS214"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"4. MY FLYING SAUCER DRAWINGS AND PLANS: Preliminary Technical Background Having determined that a DC. brush discha rge induces movement in the direction it is pointed, by \"rarifying\" and stretching the ether, Tesla did intensive research with the phenomenon of rotating brush discha rge, and how it can be controlled. 33 This research led up to Tesla's proof of concept, by 1894. The rotation of the brush, caused by rotation of a magnetic field, is the appare nt cause of precession of spinning bodies, and of non-spinning flying saucers. Since the brush induces movement in the direction pointed, its rotation causes the precessive osc illations. This is also consistent with the rotation of the brush clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere. Since a spinning body carries electrostatic charges as it spins, it generates an invisible brush which moves at a slower rpm, to create precessive movement. Here, Tesla artificially created a rotating brush by inductance, in a non- spinning body. P 2 (or p2) is apparently two primaries, since two identical pancake secondaries can respond at different wave forms, determined by tuning in each of the two primaries. At one-quarter wave, the secondary will create a D.C. brush discharg e. Referring to the illustration on page 197, Tesla's pa tent #723,188, Method of Signalling, P 1 and P 2 are the two differently tuned pancake coil primar ies, each having identical secondaries, run on the same system, which makes th em appropriate for electropulsion. An electrostatic generator is unwieldy and has a low output for its size. The problem Tesla faced was how to produce a ps eudo-electrostatic D.C. brush with his small, light-weight high frequency coils. In reiteration, in the page 197 illustration, the coil to the left can be tuned to a quarter wavelength, to produce the brush discharge, while the coil to the right is tuned to a half or full wave, constituting a high frequency alternating current. The brush enables the ether carriers and tubes of force to enter the ship's conductors (the metallic shell), while the other coil compresses the ether carriers so that no tubes of force can pass, so that the ship will have no inertial resistance to hold it back, and it can be accelerated quic kly as well as turned on a dime. Since the direction of momentum will be nor mal to the surface of the conductor, the brush can be diverted around a curved surface which is perpendicular to the direction of desired movement. It was necessary for Tesla to learn how to control the position of the brush, since a brush-control system (ma gnets) would make it unnecessary to have a cumbersome system of different coils for every direction. With a simple two electrode system, the ship could be propelled in any desired direction. As stated by Tesla 34 , \"The rotation may be reversed by a magnet kept at some distance. \" \". ..the fact that the brush turns, as far as I could observe, in any position, would speak for this view.\" In his vacuum tube expriments with the brush, using concentric (double, inner and outer) bulbs, with a central emission electrode, Tesla stated: \"As to the cause of the formation of the brush or stream, I think it is due to the electrostatic action of the globe and the dissymetry of the parts... \", sa ying that if the two bulbs had been perfect, 33 Nikola Tesla, Experiments with Alternate Currents of High Potential and High Fre quency (Lecture before the Institute of Electric al Engineers, London, 1892) McGraw Publishing Co., New York (1904). 34 Nikola Tesla, Experiments, etc. (Supra) p. 48.

The new coil, which could be in a cone shape or of the \"pancake\" type, could be tuned to one-quar ter wave to produce the brush discharge by means of impulses which have a negative pre ponderance, or tuned to the half or full wave, to produce the high frequency A.C. current. As said by Tesla earlier 36 , \"...in alternating currents of very high frequency the positive and negative impulses are not equal, but that one always preponderates over the other. \" The D.C. nature of high frequency quarter-wave pulses have been similarly analyzed in modern times 37 , as follows (in pertinent part, emphasis mine): \"Since electromagnetic effects are not transmitted instantly from point to point in space...there is a time lag between changes in charge and current distribution on the dipole\" which \"...allows some of the energy to continue flowing outward even though conditions at the dipole may have changed to indicate an inward flow of energy...as ij some of the electric and magnetic field has become detached from the dipole or 'shaken off' by the oscillation. \" The intens ity of the emitted wave is dependent upon the increased frequency, and the time lag beco mes more significant, since \"...the power radiated varies as the fourth power of the frequency. \" Tesla moved his primary to the outside of his new \"single terminal coil\", with each turn of the secondary (inside it) having progr essively increased spacing and insulation, as the potential increased between the turns, toward its single center terminal. This allowed for higher voltages with greater effect, si nce the vector produc t of the electric and magnetic force in a region of space de termines the extent of electromagnetic momentum imparted. 38 Since, as Thomson said, momentum is imparted to conductors at right angles to the magnetic inductance and current, it naturally follows that Tesla's single terminal pancake coil is most appropriate, because it's flat profile allow it to be conveniently positioned in the ship's peripheral spaces, parallel to and inside its outer surfaces, which conserves space inside. The first of my proposed ships, of ulti mate simplicity, has an electromagnetic turning system, with two coils used for ve rtical buoyancy, and two coils used for horizontal flight. Two sets of electromagnets mounted peripherally to the front coil are used to divert the brush to the right or left. 35 Nikola Tesla, Letter, Some Experiments in Tesla's Labora tory with Currents of High Potential and High Frequency ELECTRICAL REVIEW, N.

This harassment took up almost all my time, energy, and resources, and destroyed my family. The lead attorney in this abuse was a Jesuit-trained attorney of Sicilian extraction, who had prosecuted G.I.s for the J.A.G., during the Vi etnam War.

My strategy was also designed to avoid exposing a more valuable invention to the prying eyes of the corpor ate-state monopolists, during the supposedly secret patent proceeding. Patent examiners have their ma ny offices in the outlying areas surrounding Washington, D.C., tucked away in little offices which are not under close scrutiny by the patent office. The examiners often have semi-i lliterate or mentally retarded secretaries who have no idea of what is going on, so that under-the-table dealings between the examiners and the large interests can be conducted, in violation of patent rules, without the ignorant secretaries getting wise. One invention I had developed in 1978 had already been stolen by a creep who had been given a new, false identity in Amer ica, by the U.S. Army C.I.C., after being brought here under Operation Paperclip at the end of WWII. His spec ialty seemed to be industrial espionage, and he had the CIA's cooperation and protection in whatever he did. I later received confirmation that the CIA employs such people in an on-going program to steal technology from inventors to be sold to fund their black operations. The stolen invention was a new kind of sola r voltaic cell, created with a new kind of construction technique carried out with a ne w mass-production technique for producing solar voltaic chips on a conveyor belt, carrying the chips through several chambers. The process used hydrofluoric acid vapor, cont aining positive and negative dopants, applied to layers of pure, crystalline silica sand, the crystals of which were to be electromagnetically polarized and positione d, before being fused with microwaves. Between the silica crystals, layers of 'sputte red' metals were appl ied for conductivity. I chose hydrofluoric acid vapor to carry the dopants, since it would etch them into the sand crystals. The process eliminated the very expensive and tedious process involving the growing of silicone crystals in a high temperature furnace, after which the crystals had to be sliced into thin wafers with a di amond saw. Instead, I used silica sand crystals produced in nature. In addition, my automate d process was designed to further decrease the price of the cells. Cheap, but durable materials and pr ocesses were used throughout. This process became the new industry stan dard, and has made $millions—maybe even $billions—for the CIA-fri endly industrialists. Within 10 days of the theft of my plans for this invention, a Michigan pal of the thief filed a patent application. The thie f also stole over 80 ounces of highly purified iridium (a platinum group metal, worth over $80,000.00 at the time), which I had extracted from ore concentrate, at great risk to my life and health under the circumstances. The patent neglected to include the part about using pu re silica sand, and used only the more usual sliced crystal wafe rs, along with the rest of my ingenious new process. I reasoned that th e exclusion of the sand technology was because it has the capacity to make solar voltaic cells so cheap that you could use them as roof shingles, and the invention would become public domain in only 17 years. Such a technology would soon greatly diminish dependency on fossil fuels and electric power companies. The patent concentrated on my manufa cturing process, which increased the efficiency of solar voltaic cells by almost 100%—from around 12-14% to 25%. The invention was then sold to ARCO, a comp any created by Robert O. Anderson of Roswell, former president of the Bilderberg Group, as I have already mentioned.

My patent application—the one for the tran smission invention—was for an off-the- shelf, universal, variable, dynamic transm ission, which could be produced as an hydraulic or pneumatic one, in a multitude of forms and sizes. I knew that there was nothing like it on the market or in the patent office, though there were several inventions which had come close, passing right by it, ye t missing it completely. Some had parts or sections similar to it, used in ways that showed a complete unawareness of the simple invention lying only inches away. Due to th eir failures to see the invention, their inventions were no more than inoperable and inefficient conglomerations. My drawings and basic parts of the application and inven tion are shown in Appe ndix A. I dedicated this invention to the public in my first edition of 1993, to prevent the corporate thieves from profiting from it or keeping it out of public use. I knew that under the constitution, the patent office was obligated to grant a patent on this invention, once it became apparent that it was a valuable, novel creation like no other. By allowing corporate thieves a preliminary look at a patent application, they can decide whether or not they are interested in it. If so, the examiner can run the applicant ragged with all kinds of bureaucratic proce dures and fees, intended to force him to abandon his application. Once the applicant abandons his application, the corporation can apply for a patent on the exact, same, id entical invention, receive a patent, and grease the palm of the examiner. This prevents the public from using the invention for at least 20 years (about three years are take n up in applying for the patent, and an additional 17 years are added to that), thus slowing down progress, so that the vested interests can continue to promulgate their archaic technology. By the end of that time, if the corporation has chosen not to put the inve ntion into service, it is usually forgotten about. There I was with a series of CIA-instigated abusive lawsuits against me, and at the same time, a pending patent application. Between the Oct. 25, 1978 invention and metals theft, and the 1993 pub lication of the first edition of this book, at least four murder attempts were made against me, all of which I could connect to the CIA and its technology thieves. There were probably more murder attempts than that, but the other attempts were more difficult to identify. One of the murder attempts consisted of having children give me food in a restaurant whic h was contaminated wi th salmonella, on the same day that a \"notice of abandonment\" was mailed by the patent examiner from Washington, D.C. The only peop le who could have known of the mailing of the notice, were those the examiner told , in violation of the rule of secrecy. That occurred in 1992, at which time I began writing this book in earn est, with the determination to publish it, since another murder attempt could succeed, and it would be attributed to \"natural causes\", and no one would ever know why. The courts, through a series of judicially corrupt and abusive orders, based on lies, repeatedly held me in contempt without no tice or hearing, struck pleadings necessary to protect my civil and property rights, and prohibited me from filing pleadings, in violation of my due process rights.

It is my intent to give these inventions to the public to further punish the elite, along with this expose of flying saucer electric propulsion tech nology, as my revenge for having subjected my family and me to the judicial abuse and deprivation of presence of mind, money, civil rights, human rights, and property. The civil judicial system is a trap devised by corporate-statists, to ensnare and devour all those whose interests conflict with theirs'. The in volvement of the N.S.A. and CIA is incidental to their functions as pawn s in the game, under Trilateral Commission orders, to protect the corporate/state alliance from damaging scientific and technological breakthroughs and leaks. The President is a member of the Trilater al Commission, and he gives the orders which the Commission gives to him. An example of the behavior of this hierarchy is the Gulf War bombings of Iraq in 1992 and 1998. The IMF and Bilderbergers want possession of Russia's natura l resources and basic industrie s, such as the phone system and other utilities—the things people must pay for every day—the same things the elite owns here. Russia's loans from the IMF see m to be unsecured, as the Russians have held back on using their major national resour ces as collateral, while trying to get on their feet as a free market economy. The e lite wants them to use their vast natural resources and utility concessi ons as collateral for their IMF loans, so they can be induced to default on their loans, with th e elite then coming into possession of these resources through bankruptcy and foreclosure procedures. Russia has an oil deal with Iraq which they need to achieve a valid credit rating, and to pay off existing IMF loans which are con tinually overdue. The Russians are on their knees, and the IMF and Bilderbergers do not intend to let them get on their feet until they control Russia's natural resources, the same as they control them in America. The bombings of Iraq are designed to prevent Russia's recovery, and primarily have nothing to do with anything else. The impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton have been designed to turn the heat up to fo rce him to bomb Iraq for the Banksters. That way, the Russian-Iraqi oil deal will go sour and the Russians will be unable to repay their loans. It is hoped that, through this con tinual ruin of Russia's attempts to succeed as a free market economy, the Russians will eventually be forced to surrender their resources to the Banksters. Now that Clinton has bombed the Ira qis once more, he probably won't be impeached. After all, the whole series of incidents involving Monica Lewinsky were orchestrated through a Pentagon set-up, in which a Pentagon employee—Linda Tripp— tape-record her conversations with Monica Le winsky, another Pentagon employee.

On the face of it, since this system serves only the elite, and provides no benef its to the ordinary American, the system should be abolished, and our rights restored . This includes ending the emergency status which has been protracted to suspend our rights since 1933 (though some think since 1913). We ordinary Americans should not support a civil judicial system which fails to support us and is only for the powerful to keep us under their control.

Legitimate conflicts should be handled through a private criminal justice restitution system, or private civil court system, devoid of corporate-socialist conflicts of interest. Only cases which meet a preliminary burden of criminal jurisdiction should be allowed to be filed. The rest should be resolved by mediation, or perhaps \"Tanistry\" (the ancient Irish system based on Phoenician law). With these suggestions in mind, we ar e now going to play a new game, in the following three parts, which I call (1) \"The Ninth Amendment Quiet Game\", (2) \"The Article One (Sec. 8, cl [8], and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments Property Game\", and (3) \"The First Amendment End-Run Game\" (also referred to as \"The Ol' Statute of Liberty Play\"). The Patent and Trademark Office's (\"P.T.O. 's\") rules are designed to loot isolated, individual, dreamer-type—typica lly eccentric or naive—inventors, some of whom may have only one good idea in their entire lives. Li ke beneficial insect s being ensnared by giant, evil spiders, they are lured into the trap, encouraged by government/corporate propaganda, to seek patents. Corporations, which invent NOTHING (except high-toned slogans and logos), collaborate with the Patent Office, successfully stealing inventions from a steady flow of inventor-sucker appli cants with stars in their eyes. This book blows the cover on that scam. The creativity which has been the hallmar k of the American experience is rapidly diminishing with the oppression of our crea tive people, by denying fair compensation and credit, while exploiting their creative pr oducts. Inventors come to the P.T.O. as trusting fools, and under its we ird rules, the P.T.O. stabs them in their backs, helping the corporate thieves steal their inventions. If these inventors had other inventions—which most of them do—they would make no further disclosures—which most of them don't—in order to avoid repe ating the trauma and disappointment of multiple \"patent rape\" by the U.S. government and corporate state. I can now speak for these hapless inventors, since I was among them. While not all inventors' claims are valid , the P.T.O. condescendingly grants many token patents for worthless, inoperable 'paper' inventions, simply because the applications are filed by patent attorneys, conform to the P.T.O.'s weird bureaucratic idea of proper applications, and present no real threat to the vested interests. Though such inventions may be harmless, inoperable devices, the patents may contain disclosures which work to the benefit of th e corporations, by creating the false illusion ALIENS223"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"that the 'little fellah' has rights too, pr ovided he goes into hock for a high-priced PATENT ATTORNEY. This false illusion help s maintain the flow of suckers to the patent office. Meanwhile, more valuable a pplications are denied for purely formal reasons, since the inventions are to end up in the hands of corporate thieves, who may at their whims suppress or confis cate them, obliterating the true inventors with a wall of litigation they cannot even begin to penetrate. Though I have been abused many times by my government, I refuse to dissolve in despair like so many others whom the P.T.O. and the civil litigation system have permanently crushed. A patent as we know it does not secure an ything, except the right to attempt to enforce it in court. The true nature of the right is the inalienable property right of an inventor, to the disposition of wealth he crea ted. Property rights are not created by the government, and an inventor owns his invent ion whether or not the government grants a patent, which is not true security. \"Invention\" is an individual, creative process. While we patronize—purely as a legal fiction—that co rporations are individu als, we should not extend this fiction to consider them to be inventors of creative products. Corporations should be absolutely prohibited from seeking a patent, or from holding a patent or the rights to one, until after a patent has been granted to the true individual inventor(s). Furthermore, the P.T.O., under our Congress—w hich is constitution ally mandated with the duty to secure to inventors the propert ies of their inventions—should have their provisions completely restructured to acco mplish the exact constitutional mandate, no ifs, ands, or buts. It is well-known to every real inventor in America, that the system fails to work as intended, and must be changed for the better or abolished. A. THE REAL ISSUES: THE WAVE OF THE FUTURE The groundswells in the EAST are moving toward us like a TIDAL WAVE, which the bureaucrats will be caught up in for the sa me reasons as their Soviet counterparts; they will eventually have to find some form of productive work, after a flabby lifetime of sponging off the taxpayers; many bureaucrats who anticipate the fu ture are already engaged in damage control. (It is even rumored that they are wearing bullet-proof underwear.) A bureaucrat of an y kind will never be anything but a leech to the common man. In every socialistic society, the bureaucrats are the disgusting toadies who sell out their fellow citizens, in exchange for a small sh are of the loot stolen by the power elite. Bureaucrats are not entitled to gloat over th e failure of the communist system, since people who live in glass houses shouldn't thro w rocks. The issue is not simply whether the state permits religious freedom—as some would like for you to believe—but whether governments have legitimate power to execu te, imprison, or punish citizens, or to confiscate their money ('taxes'), or property (o r inventions), or in general, their wealth, for the \"public good\", for bureaucratic convenie nce, or for the political recalcitrance of their owners or creators, by having disbelieved, mistrusted, or defied the government, or for having refused to obey, or to believe what their government ordered them to believe, or for having followed or advocated a politi cal philosophy or personal, moral lifestyle which was officially de clared to be undesirable or prohibited, even though legal; or for having simply asked the question of whether bureaucrats really serve the interests of everyone; or for having suggested that they serve only their own interests and those of an American corporate oligarchy, similar to that which ruled Soviet Russia or Nazi ALIENS224"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Germany, and still rules cert ain Central and South American countries (suc h as \"United Fruit Company\"), or China (i.e., such as \"E XXON\", or the \"Communist Party\", etc.); or for suggesting that they repres ent illegitimate, usurped auth ority of a corporate-fascist state, rather then the proper, constitutionally-ordained, limited power delegated by self-governing, sovereign individuals, who lack the authority or right to delegate more authority to any government; and finally, whethe r such agencies as th e P.T.O. operate in conformance with their duties to the American People, which the Constitution originally mandated Congress to enforce. We can never have a \"kinder, gentler societ y\", so long as there is a gestapo-like I.R.S. to force us to pay for the extermin ation of Iraqis who are in the way of the Trilateral Commission's plan to confiscate the natural resources, monetary system, and industries of Russia, or so long as the doct rine of eminent domain is legal in America. So-called communist states are in reality, corpor ate states. Chernobyl was no accident, but rather the inevitable result of corporate-state arrogance, brittleness, recklessness, irresponsibility, negligence, oversight, and insanity, born of seemingly immutable and concentr ated monolithic power. The corporate-stat ist Federal Reserve Banksters exert coercion thr ough police-state agencies like the I.R.S., F. B.I., C.I.A., N.S.A., A.E.C., D.O.E., N.R.C., and S.E.C. etc., to enforce exclusive commercial, industrial, or governmental franchises grante d either by or to the state, or through partnerships with the select corporate providers of \"public services\", who enjoy matrimonial bliss in the convenient (for them, not for us) fascist marriage between \"...the state and industry...\". In Soviet Russ ia, the corporations were composed only of members of the Communist Party. Here, the party is replaced by \"public corporations\", which differ only to the extent of a grea ter amount of mixed-economy socialism, and some possible token collectivistic particip ation by the public as \"stockholders\". To induce productivity of inventors, public policy must reflect a false illusion of freedom and opportunity, so that the trust of inventors can be maintained. After all, if the people don't present the illusion of free dom, who will trust the Patent Office? Like their Soviet counterparts, the American government enhances corporate-state power, by assuring the accumulation of technologically creative products by coercive-monopolist corporate partners, through fraud upon individual creative people and the people as a whole. By misfeasance and abuse of the powers of Congress, under U.S. Const. Art. 1, sec. 8 cl. [8], the Patent Office promises a patent under the Constitution, as a means of enforcing a se venteen-year monopoly through litigation, in the name of the inventor, as an inducement for inventors to disclose and to share their discoveries with society, for the advancement of science and the useful arts; that is their \"bait\". But the P.T.O.'s real bosses are not \"the people\", any more than those of the Soviet bureaucracy. Its rules have been redesigned since the days of Jefferson and Franklin. Patent applications are like ripe plum s to the elite, all for the picking. Any significant energy, transportation or manufacturing breakthrough automatically becomes a national security secret, which allows th e government to remove all evidence of a patent application, to confis cate the invention, and to prohibit disclosures to the public under the secrecy acts. After confiscation, the work is then turned over to the usual corporate-state companies, so they can manufac ture secret equipment to be sold to the government at huge profit. ALIENS225"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"An example was the invention of an artifi cial fish gill, which separates hydrogen and oxygen in water, on contact, and could be used to power a hydrogen-powered car, etc. (NOTE: Paradoxically, the taking of such discoveries by the secret government, in our name, obliterates our knowledge of the technology. Nonetheless, it becomes public domain one year after the government's ac quisition—by about 1974 for the fish gill device—but since such secrets are rarely d eclassified, we may never know about them.). Other discoveries, which cannot be construed as national security secrets, are steered into the hands of their corporate partners through abuse of P.T.O. procedures, to the disparagement of the individuals who created them, and to the detriment of the public. If a discovery represents a threat to obsolete technology being so ld by the coercive monopolists, the discover y is concealed, and th e public never uses it . In many cases, inventors who protest, or refuse to give up their inventions, are fraudulently labeled as \"criminals\" or \"con- artists\", by the government, which often adapts abusive prosecutions under the Federal Securities Ex change Commission regulations, or the I.R.S., etc., for the purpose of eradicating competition to their corporate partners. The greatest threat to the freedom of th e people, is official government secrecy, particularly concerning energy and transporta tion, and coercive, obsolete technological (economic) slavery, enforced by a fascist judiciary which takes its marching orders from the N.S.A., CIA, Trilateral Commission, and the Illuminati (which in our context, involves the upper echelons of the \"Knights Templars\", and the Jesuit Order—including some within the American Masonic Order...a small, powerful sect some of whom may be found within the Shriners, the Knights of Columbus, the Knights of Malta, the Bilderburgers, or any other secret group, su ch as the CIA. Some American Masonic lodges have been converted to the Illuminati Order, through the influence of the \"Old Prussian, Northern European, White Freemasonry\" which was infested by the Nazi \"Ahnenerbe\". These same powers exist within the Jesuit Order, especially those derived from French and Bavarian sources, after the ti me of Napoleon. Either way, they get us coming and going. The greatest threat to the central banks and their underlings—which control basic mineral resources, refineries, chemicals, phar maceuticals, and public utilities, and other public service cartels fueled by these—is the development of autonomous home-generated power systems, which can power cheap transportation and home industry, and heat and power homes. To make this threat more complete, such power systems should generate their energy from water (hydrogen and oxygen), from the air (combustion of nitrogen and oxygen by electrical spark-discharge), from the earth-atmosphere electrical potential, from cosmic radiation, from magnetism, from non-radioactive nuclear reactors, or from wi nd and solar power, which the government cannot justify the regulation of because they are safe. The development and use of such systems is completely consistent to the achievement of a pollution-free environment. The courts insure the cartels against such th reats, by secret national security judicial proceedings, binding all judges and courts against all free individuals, under the unconstitutional laws involved. Corporate-state power rests on control of primary reso urces, insured by judicial suppression of threatening technology, thus artificially maintaining our dependency.

On occasion, government scientis ts with top-secret clearances approached me to deny the government's possession of what they believed I was working on, presumably to induce me to disclose a par ticular discovery to them in a patent application, so they could acquire it through national security priorities. Since I have already been suckered in several times, I won't do it again, and advise all other inventors to do the same. Unless you're a huge corporation, they'll rip all energy inventions off. The national security confiscation of inve ntions creates a convenient shield, so that no patents are granted. The discoveries remain secret, never become public domain, and even the inventors are denied access to them. The government chooses who manufactures them, without the knowledge or permission of the inventors. The inventors are denied knowledge of inco me and value in the secret usage, and the hugh potential profits possible by otherwise public usage, as well as the related benefits of prestige, recognition, and fame. The inventions are appropriated by force, and the inventors given whatever the government decides, if anyt hing. The inventors are threatened with criminal sanctions for disobedience, under na tional security laws, without the right to public trial. We never benefit, science and the useful arts are not advanced, the constitutional provisions are unenforced or destroyed, and our government has betrayed us. The individual's most private intelle ctual rights and property—his mind and its creations—has been raped by the fraud and fo rce of his own government. In many cases, inventions are stolen by the CIA, which th en creates its own fake corporations to secretly sell the stolen inventions to the government, producing more income for \"black operations\". The whining and whimpering by corporat e statists, about Japanese or Asian competition, is dishonest, undignified, ignorant, and disgus ting. American corporations are at fault for their creative incompetence, and their compromise of the principles upon which a creative and competitive free-market society is based. Those who fear a free world should not be taken seriously. It is th ey who would drag us into another war for their benefit, by playing on old sentiments, to force us to fight and die for their \"right\" to screw us and not even kiss us. The argument that the Japan ese do not practice free-market economics internally is impertinent for three reasons, which are: (1) That the competition should be between the best products for the best prices, rather than between nationalities; and (2) that since the U.S. is not practicing free-market economics internally either, the corporations are equitably estopped to complain about the Japa nese system; and (3) th at since the system which promotes and protects the greatest degr ee of individual creativ ity and laissez-faire will be the actual \"winner\", only these parame ters and no others should be considered, in the interest of everyone in the world, regardless of na tionality. This is al so in the interest of the national security. Trying to bilk a bunc h of old veterans of the Pacific war into thinking it is in our interest to erect protec tionist barriers, is a lie , and will only hurt the Average American, and empower the elite. No credit is due to the P.T.O. or judiciary, in the demise of socialism or statism, since they are part of that system, and are still supporting it. All credit belongs to creative people—individual freedom fighters everywhere—whom the corporate-state is against.

A protest against socialist bureaucratic deadbeats in Romania, Byelorussia, or China, is a protest against them here. The historical clock is ticking away like a time bomb, and they don't know how to diffuse it. Chernobyl was an alarm in the early morning of vast change. It was no wonder th at there were no bureaucrats fighting or resisting Big Brother at Tiananmen Square, Concord, the Alamo, or the Little Bighorn; bureaucrats need Big Brother, and Big Br other needs them. Why would bureaucrats want freedom, which would take away their illegitimate jobs and power? Why would bureaucrats, who apparently represent defective human genotypes who are incapable of independent, creative or productive work, want a free system, in which their only remaining means of survival would be as uncreative and incompetent—although more honest—thieves? Why would bureaucrats want completely safe nucl ear reactors, which would take away their excuses for regulat ory busy-work, and threaten their cozy corporate partnerships? For obvious reasons (as some may have no ticed), our bureaucrats and some large American corporations have been helping Co mmunist bureaucrats in Russia to resist change. That is because, although change is in evitable, they want to insure that those in control in the future represent the interests of the Trilateral Commission, as did their Communist predecessors, and that renegade , truly capitalist people do not end up in control. If true capitalism were to take root in the east, it might even spread to America. More than anything else, bureaucr ats fear the insecurities of no rmal life in a free society, because the security of their guaranteed jobs has crippled their creativity, which is the primary means for the survival and flowering of civiliz ation and the Human Race. They will have to learn to walk all over again. B. THE SOCIALIST BUREAUCRACY: A CONSPIRACY WITHOUT LEADERS It has been estimated that out of every five people, three of them must work extra to support the remaining two who are usel ess government employees or dependents. The conspiracy between the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the N.S.A., the New Mexico Judiciary, and other bureaucratic, corporate-fascist entities, are united in the suppression of competing technologies, and the continua l theft of ideas and wealth from inventors, thinkers, indepe ndent scientists, artists, writers, designers, etc.,—or their heirs, grantees, vendees, or devisees. Thes e thefts perpetuate the corporate-fascist system, which is without actual leaders, alth ough there are people who pose as purported leaders. How, you may ask, can such a vast organizational structure continue to function without leaders? First of all, they have almo st unlimited funds from us to waste in the process. Secondly, the organi zational structure is maintained by a common belief in \"collective superiority\"—a religion of so rts—promulgated by the Illuminati, which means our bureaucracy is careening down the same road as the alleged leadership of the former Soviet Union, their flunkies. If one examines the so-called leadership structure of the Soviet state from its ineeption—now re ndered more obvious due to the relative openness (\"Glasnost\")—it is apparent th at there NEVER WAS any leadership, but rather a mass of people who followed wh at were proffered by the Communist Party leadership as leaders. The Sovi et people followed this pseudo-leadership blindly, until it became apparent that there was no control or lead ership, when the system was unable to ALIENS228"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"feed them, and it imploded, as the people real ized that all there was, was themselves as individuals, believing the BIG LIE told to th em by Marx, Engels, Lenin, Trotsky, and Stalin, all members of the Illuminati. The wa ll of credibility was broken away by the harsh reality that the gigant ic bureaucracy was bleeding th e citizenry dry, while living high on the hog, while attempting to sustain the fictitious coll ectivist juggernaut. It was Immanuel Kant, Georg Hegel, Marx and Lenin who propagated the Illuminati lie...the half-baked idea that \"...each idea contains the germ of its own dissolution\"—and that contradictions exist in reality. But the untrut h of that premise should now be corrected to say that \"each FALSE idea contains the germ of its own dissolution\". The germ of dissolution within the fa lse premise of both the communist and corporate-stat e Illuminati philosophies, is that each fa ils to recognize the fact that man qua man's primary means of survival is the creative process, and that an ideal society is one which maintains the conditions under wh ich individuality—required for this human, individual process—is maximi zed. A society in which the \"means of production\" (i.e., incorrectly thought by the communists to mean all property, but which in reality is the individual) is in the hands of an imaginary, leaderless, collectivist state, ruled by a fictitious \"mass, collective unconsciousness or consciousness\", is the diametric opposite of one which will foster maximum development of the individual creativity of its citizens. The single greatest enemy of the creative pr ocess is dependency (created by fear and a desire for unearned security) which is the hallmark of any socialist state. Creativity, above all, demands the greatest degree of individual social, intellectual, and economic courage and independence from the shackles of any group. The Florentine Renaissance saw a rebirth of creati vity and wealth, because of a rediscovery and emergence of the concept of individual rights, which libera ted Europe from the shackles of Byzantine Christianity (comparable to today's \"religi ous right\") which fathered the Dark Ages. Where people were burned at the stake or im paled if they uttered anything deviating from the 'divine plan', individu alism and creativity were practiced only in secrecy, in a society of shared poverty. A long struggle by humanists eventually brought change, and we are still in the Renaissance, continuously struggling to maintain it, while various Illuminati mystics have sought to bring it to an end, and to usher in a Neo-Dark Age, with them as the secret elite. There is a great difference between the \"THIEVES of Light and Knowledge\", and the true \"BRINGERS of Light and Knowle dge\". The deluded mystical Illuminati Trilateralists falsely depict themselves as the \"bringers of light and knowledge\", while other mystics (Christians, Je ws, etc., unwittingly controlled by the Illuminati) openly make war against knowledge, as evil, b ased on their ignorant misconception that knowledge is the product of \"Lucifer\". This variation creates a false contrast which makes the Illuminati look better. Meanwhile, the Illuminati confiscat es the most valuable knowledge, required for them to control the wo rld, gladly assisted by the conspiracy of insane bureaucrats, secret agents of the state, and the \"religious right\", on their behalf. The power-mad Trilateralists-Fascists sustai n their power by theft, suppression and concealment of the most valuable technol ogy and knowledge from the people, through the national security machinery of the state, in pursuit of the dual goal of state ownership of the purported means of productio n, and deprivation of the peoples' means for achieving or maintaining freedom and de mocracy. They are attempting to return us to a dark age of mystical insanity, to worship the concepts of \"collective consciousness\" ALIENS229"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"and \"cooperation\", as \"gods\", with the essent ial creative people as slaves, in a \"New World Order\" (actually an \"Old World Orde r\") created and run by them. The religious right is only a temporary pawn in the game . Naziism was their last attempt in this direction, but failed, because their leader, Hitler, like Na poleon, got out of hand, and bit off more than he could chew, just like the Soviet Communist leaders. How many chances does the Illuminati get? Their \"Kali Ma\" is insatiable, because more people, whom the Illuminati fear, are being born each day, while many are killed each day in fake wars. The dissemination of knowledge which represe nts a threat to the secret dictatorship of the Trilateral corporate-state coercive monopolists, is no different than the Florentine humanists defying the fanatic psychopathic criminals who ran the Byzantine Empire. The insanity of those Holy Roman Emperors was exposed by Plo tinus, in his Secret History of the Byzantine Emperors, detail ing how the Empress Theodora (an ex-whore and dancer from the Circo Massimo) horribly roasted her own child to death in a bronze ox. Her mate, the \"Holy Roman Emperor\" Ju stinian, drove 40,000 Mithraists into a hippodrome in Asia Minor, and exterminated them. 2 The Trilateral Commissione rs, like other bureaucrats a nd professional thieves, produce no wealth, goods, or services, and fo r all practical purposes, are \"on welfare\". Yet these welfare bums use our money and resources to pay for the army of bureaucrats which serve the corporate-state, and not us, w ith their boots on our heads. All hail, Kali Ma! Psychologically, socialist bureaucrats by nature are uncreative people who are instinctively intolerant of creative people, who constantly remind them of their own creative incompetence and socio-economic para sitism. It is as if certain defective humans are born to serve the Illuminati. A belief in bureaucratic-socialism is a thin veil covering one's own feelings of self-hatred, f ear, and creative insecur ity. In America, the existence of this velvet dictatorship is not felt through the iron fist of a Gestapo (short for Geheimnistadtspolizei, meaning \"secret state police\"), but rather through an invisible, deceptively diffused, choking web of bureaucratic regul atory entanglements and litigation, backed by police who go into action only when social ostracism, subterfuge and intimidation fail to obtain compliance, to use physical brutality to execute court or other bureaucratic orders. Th ough the people are aware of the problems, they are unable to specifically identify th em, since the public media controlled by the Trilateral Commission continuously obliterates and confuses the facts. There is no genuine support for bureaucrac y by rational citizens. Only insecure, deluded, or power-mad bureaucr ats take pride in such work , and only stupid or gullible citizens believe that these bureaucrats act in their best interest. In spite of the tintinnabulations of a vast army of yapping attorneys and bureaucrats of every guise, representing Trilateral interests, the people innately know the horrible truth, and it has made them weary, and it despairs them to know that they are not truly free. It is not a thankless task they do, as so me self-deluded bureaucrats may pretend; it is a \"useless\" task which th rows monkey wrenches in everyone's cogs. Anyone with ethics would either commit suicide out of remo rse or loss of self esteem, or dismantle their agencies, resign, and never seek power again. How they resist the temptation for self-destruction, in the face of such massive public disdain, is an enigma. In the end, they will be martyrs to stupidity and injustice. 2 Otto Benesch, Art of the Northern Renaissance.

This simple goal has been artificially made to seem more difficult by the chaos crea ted by the Illuminati, mostly through those in public disservice. C. TRAITOR JUDICIARY Members of the American judiciary and bar associations have betrayed a sacred trust and duty to enforce our Bill of Rights, and are hated by the people for breaching that duty. A seemingly impenetrable wall has been gradually built up by the massive volume of past legal decisions and precedents, creating a barrier between the judiciary, and the people who are entitled to demand it s sendees. There is massive disrespect for the judiciary and legal profession, which is responsible for a great deal of the crime committed by helpless people, who see no ot her way out of their problems—created mostly by the government—since the)' lack access to the system. This one segment of our government is si ngly responsible for greater damage to us than all the other dangerous subversive and other traitorous elements in our history. They have intentionally misinterpreted our Bill of Rights and Constitution, pretending to misunderstand the concept of natural rights upon which our civilization is based. The general public disdains all lawyers and judi ciary because of this, even though many of them as individuals do not have an ar ticulate understanding of their rights. Many Americans who have the most profound ('practical' rather than theoretical) understanding of their natural rights, are among those we generally refer to as the \"common, ordinary, working people of America\". The failure by our judiciary to protest, st op, or reverse the er osion and destruction by government of constitutionally guaranteed protections of our inalienable rights, gives aid and comfort to the enemies of democracy (and the enemies are among us), and this negligence is recognized by the people as treasonous. The only response to a more flagrant public hatred of la wyers, for example, was a wi despread program of false propaganda which the bar asso ciations unleashed on the Amer ican public in 1992, as if the only problem was one which could be cure d by false propaganda, when the fact is, our judiciary panders only to those whose vested interests gi ve them a stake in corporate socialism, because the newspaper and other media giants of the Illuminati control the political process through which they are el ected. If they do not obey their bosses, replacements will promptly be found. For that reason, corrupt politicians are more persistent than honest ones, whic h are few and very far between. A government which abuses the rights of the individual—any individual—because of his individuality, or his conflict with a voting consensus—will get no genuine respect in return. What may be misinterpreted as \"r espect\", is only fear. I think it was either Henry David Thoreau or Walt Whitman who said something like, \"When the rights of the many shall take away the rights of the one , the rights of the many shall suffer\". It naturally follows that when the 'rights of the many' suffer, the power and jobs of those responsible should be abolished by the 'many'.

Only judicial incompetents take such opinions—so lacking in merit, and corrupted by compromise—seriously. The gross lack of cognitive skills—in decisions produced in 'c anned English', on legal word processors—exemplifies what I call the \"new judicratic callousness\". This cognitive incompetence, which began to emerge particularly in the '60s, has finally oozed all the way to the top of the judicial garbage pail, as if the weight of so much fresh garbage has forced the most putrefied, liquefied slime to the top.

It is a kind of 'technological Ghandiism', advocating a passive resistance by creative people, to the \"consensus-fascist\" system which utilizes deceit, secrecy, subterfuge, character assassination, and the manipulation of the j udiciary and public opinion, to fabricate stare decisis and a cons ensus, used to support its own actions and rulings, usurping and concentrating more illegitimate power each day. Such a fraudulent system is a threat to the survival of a truly free and creative civi lization, which we have never fully attained, but can still possibly do so. We must keep our hopes alive, and cannot reserve our challenges until after the present system has alr eady erected a system of gulags, in a role reversal to the policies of Stalin, Hitler, or Mao. I long since came to the conclusion that th ere is no one out there responsible for \"justice\", so I intend to mete some out myself, or at least to incite some inquiry which can lead to justice. The exclamation will un doubtedly be heard: \"Well, who does this guy think he is anyway? We'll just tighten the screws on him, and shut him up for good.\" The answer is: I am an indi vidual, independent, creative citizen, who is completely proud of what he is and what he advocates, with a completely clear conscience in respect to his motives and actions, despite the der ogatory rulings of petty bureaucrats, none of whom can ever say the same. I only regret al lowing myself to become a victim of the judiciary and its bosses. As they say in the law, \"Where there's a wrong, there's a remedy.\" It remains to be seen that the 'rem edy' is not in the law, but elsewhere. This book may be considered as my \"96 Theses\", na iled to the governmen t's door (ala Martin Luther's 96 theses nailed to the door of the cathedral), in a new ki nd of \"reformation\", involving a new international philosophical movement of creative, autonomous individuals. I believe I represent the future in this endeavor. A SYSTEM IN CONTEMPT OF OUR RIGHTS Though my views on the legal profession may seem harsh to lawyers, I will say to them that the only hope for obtaining the future respect for their profession is by restoring the highest values wi thin the legal profession, fo r the Bill of Rights, as absolute rights, which is precisely what the constitution says they are. Deal with it. Since the litigation against me was incessant for over seventeen years, the judicial harassment, along with harassment of any ki nd encouraged from anyone else, amounted to a permanent denial of my rights to free speech and press. Since the public deserves to know the truth, it was imperative that no more time was wasted, and I published my first edition. Those in the judiciary probably won't like what I am saying, and would probably like to put me in jail to shut me up, although it has been their usual method to use more ALIENS233"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"indirect tactics, such as citing me for contem pt and fining me in the district courts to intimidate and impoverish me or silence my criticism, by constant vexatious orders, including some which not only struck pleadi ngs, but physically removed them from the record to prevent me from further documenti ng their abuses. Their intent was clear, and my book has proved their assumptions wrong. The connections between attorneys, judges, and the CIA is well-known to some, a nd while I could point out specific people, it should suffice just to say that the CIA people are there, illegally, all over \"city hall\". Let there be no secret; while I respect what the bench is supposed to represent, I see almost no one on the bench who meets up to acceptable standards. As my rights (nature) permits, I have a personal contempt for gutless judges, because the bench deserves better, if it is to exist at all. I actually believe that more acceptable people might be found, despite what everyone says, though I could be wrong. Judges should be completely objective, fair, unbiased, and with unswerving adherence to the Bill of Rights, without regard to the race, religion, ideology, credo, or 'accident of national origin' of litigants—both plaintiffs and de fendants, even \"Texans\"—or witnesses. We should settle for nothing l ess. This selection should be made strictly by testing procedures which are adopted by Congress. On ly those who score the highest should be our judges. This \"objective system\" would result in more representation by minorities anyway, because those who have been abused should be more inclined to take the Bill of Rights seriously, anyway, and should score hi gher on the tests. The highest standards for the judiciary are imperative. T hough the ideal will always be diminished by practice, we must start at the highest level. My personal contempt is for gutles s, simpering weaklings, who appease sociopathic thug civil attorneys, and the crimin al plaintiffs they re present, by allowing them to bend them like pretzels, to obt ain fraudulent judgments and orders, and who lack the strength of character to do what is right, and yield to undue influences and pressures, to do what is wrong. I have contempt for those who have unjustifiably shown contempt for me, my rights, and the rights of all individuals, by implication. I have contempt for those who betray their sacred du ty to preserve and protect the inalienable rights of the people. Even 's econd best' is unacceptable. It takes no courage by a judge or a court, to maliciously attack the rights of a single pro se individual, or to characterize him as \"litigious\", because he seeks justice in protection of his rights, and restitution fo r wrongs done to him and his entire family. Such decisions are no more th an cowardly repetitions of the acts of thugs whom the courts have a duty to sanction. In this way, the courts have damaged the rights of all individuals, by attacking the rights of one individual, and by joining with the gangsters and pandering to the worst elements in society. It places our courts right in bed with the criminals and other socialist free-loaders, including rich co rporate ones, which makes it a form of prostitution. Decisions by the judiciary which are uncons titutional for violation of our Bill of Rights, are void, for lack of jurisdiction or of legitimately delegated (or \"delegatable\") authority from us (as the \"consenting governed\"), to render them. Such decisions deserve no respect, even if they are 'unreversed' ones, an d are grounds for impeachment, because they represent more than mere opinion, but constitute official acts which consciously ignore or destroy particular c onstitutional inalienable rights of the people without any legitimate authority, as defini tive \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" which are attempted to be passed off on us as \"law\".

Perhaps it is obvious that I am not being \"nice\". I am not in the mood for \"nice\". The time for \"nice\" is past. To put it more bluntly, there is nothing in my copy of the Constitution which says I have to be nice to blood-sucking parasites whom I hate, because they have violated my inalienable righ ts, my life's work, my property rights, and savaged my family. I am not asking them, who owe me, for anything, since it is the resources of victims like me which feed their parasitic lifestyles. The actions of the P.T.O. and the judiciary show that they are completely devoid of the spirit of the American system, or concern for human rights, as envisioned by the genius of Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, both inventor s. It was no coinciden ce that they and all the other signators of the Declaration of Independence died as paupers. In their day, the corporate-state system—called \"mercantilism\"—gave rise to the American Revolution. That revolution is betrayed multiply by the P.T.O., the judiciary, Congress, and the bureaucracy, who do no t deserve \"nice\". They deserve revolution. The government has perverted our Charter of Liberty and made it into a tawdry wall decoration—a relic of the past—in pursuit of rigid, socialistic, bureaucratic convenience and \"order\", truly in sycopha ncy to coercive monopolists (A.K.A., \"mercantilists\"), who are favored as their na tural partners, in a collective ownership system, in which the government gets the power, the cartels get the money, and we producers of all the wealth, are naturally the slaves. Public dissent has been perverted to illegal demands by a minority whose beliefs happen to mesh with corporate-statism, induced by the government to make their demands upon the judici ary and government, seeking to enforce their personal beliefs upon us, and to punish disobedience as a crime. This threat to return to a corporate-state socialist neo-dark age must be stopped. These symptoms of the disintegration of our great society are caused by the misfeasance and malfeasance of the judiciary, bureaucracy, and government of, by, and for itself. GAME NO. 2: THE ARTICLE ONE (Sec. 8, cl [8]) AND FIFTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS PROPERTY GAME I have something in store for the \"creativ ity thieves\". \"Really!\" (they exclaim). I have done this before, and I know its works. In anticipation of the present state of affairs, I took care to see that I had another, superior product \"waiting in the wings\" as it were, invented long before my birth by someone else, used in a new way, to obsolesce my invention, as my insurance from the anticipated theft. A creative in ventor should always be able to \"out-create\" common idea thieves. While this may be untrue for many of the poor little inventors whose less prolific discoveries have real merit, yet are stolen nonetheless, leaving them without a remedy, because they have no funds for attorn eys, this is not completely the case with myself. Though I may lack the large sums re quired for attorneys—as pointed out by the crappy little patent examiner, though no interference had been declared—I am not a poor little inventor with only one idea; I have hundreds of them, and more to come, at my own discretion, on demand. I am rich in ideas, and rich in the ability to have them. They can take away one, and I'll produce two more to replace it. Then I'll see to it that foreign ALIENS235"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"competitors receive the two new ones, just to punish the thieves in America. All I have to do is describe them. Foreign industrial spies are everywhere. They scoop up every American suggestion as it is uttered, and proceed like ants to convert them to reality. I must warn the coercivists, that their da ys are numbered by the lag in progress their suppression has created. The tigers are at the gates, and who will make them respect natural rights, even yours, after you have set the example of abuse and neglect? Since I am not rich and powerful (in terms of money and influence), the only recourse I now have is to exercise my right to determine the disposition of my more valuable, undisclosed inventions. They are mostly very simple, but highly unusual. For example, in comparison to the invention for which I sought a patent, they greatly depart from the relative degree of novelty. Consequen tly, I will not share my other inventions with the P.T.O., or with the sick government which employs it, and it will never control what else I have in my bag of creations. In this way, it has betrayed and caused the constitutionally ordained patent system to fail . I will also urge other inventors to refuse to play its game. It is the government which has, in fact, abandoned a legitimate patent system. People cannot be forced to invent, as shown by the example of the recently fallen communist states. Now perhaps creativity and freedom will evolve. Like the New Mexico judiciary, the P.T.O. exaggerated bureaucratic technicalities, in order to circumvent the obvious merit involved, and attempted to treat everything as if it represented \"nothing\". This was to protect the corporate thieves from the \"doctrine of anticipation\", in their patent application, simi lar to the courts' treatments in the case of the real estate and tort claims, to avoid the doctrine of res judicata. I expected both of these frauds, and was proven correct by the courts and P.T.O. The implication can now be constructively drawn from the rulings that I am just a \"frivolous type of person\", and that my other inventions—which I may transfer to foreigners— do not represent a loss of any valu able technology from this country, in the P.T.O.'s view, in which it deferred to the false validity of the New Mexico litigation. We can be confident in the 'correctness' of their rulings, since my credibility was systematically impugned, and there should be no cause for worry, and they should relax, since nothing I said had any merit, in their opinion. I had intended to use the profits—under the remote possibility that my anticipations of corporate/government fraud turned out to be unwarranted—to finance further disclosures and patent applications on my other inventions, for the mutual benefit of myself, American industry, and the advancement of science. The P.T.O. and New Mexico judiciary stopped this meaningless process. Bravo, bur eaucracy! The P.T.O. need not inquire into whether or not it delayed or obstructed scien tific or technological progress, or abatement of the environmental/energy crisis, since non e of my inventions could have helped to bring this about. It is the go vernment, and it is never wrong. ENERGY SLAVERY AND INVENTION THEFT I decided in late April, 1991, that if I can 't have what is rightfully mine, I will not share my other inventions with the Am erican government, and will file no more disclosures or applications. I conceived the pa rticular invention in 1967. It is admittedly 'low tech' in comparison with my many other inventions, which range over several fields, and include new means of nautical , aeronautical, and automotive propulsion, ALIENS236"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"numerous energy and power generators, ne w aircrafts and aerodynamic applications, boats, engines, electric motors, wind, so lar, magnetic, super-c onductor, and laser applications, semiconductors, manufacturi ng processes, chemical and metallurgical discoveries and processes, as well as numero us types of \"safe\" nuclear electric power generators, all but one of which uses no radioactive material s whatsoever. They eliminate the need for a nuclear regulatory comm ission, or \"W.I.P.P.\", as well as all the monumental expense, \"busy-work\" jobs for bureaucrats, and other associated waste, problems, and expense to taxpayers and producti ve people. In general, my inventions are to liberate people from corporate energy a nd political slavery. In reality, no ethical person has anything to lose by the widespread use of such i nventions. This entire freight train of ideas was derailed and abandoned by the P.T.O. and the National Security Agency (of the Trilateral Commission). When Nikola Tesla took almost the same approach as I have, the.F.B.I., with the aid of a specially trained German S.S. nurse, tortured him to death, learned the location of all his secret files, and impounded them under the \"Alien Properties Act\", even t hough he was an Americ an citizen. Those secrets ended up in the hands of the Nazis, thanks to our F.B.I. That was in 1943. The Nazis traded the mate rials to the Rockefellers and th e U.S. government, during a 1945 stalemate, and a large part of them ar e now stored in Los Alamos, New Mexico. New Mexico could have built itself a new 'clean' industry future around my discoveries, but its officials viciously kicked me in the teeth. This shows how ignorant people can be led to cut off their noses to sp ite their faces. Some of you readers may be familiar with \"...the Bear, the Bison, and th e Muskrat...\" (the code names for the top \"Soviet\" bombers in 1957—designed by an Amer ican, rejected by Congress, and, as we should not be surprised—sold by him to the Russians). New Mexico won't make a dime off me now, or create a single job, and can continue its self-made bondage to government jobs and the large corporations, for judicially abusing me and damaging my credibility. For this they get nothing! Blinded by petty jealousy, they couldn't see that they we re being \"motivated\" at their own level by the CIA. The issue is not what \"this Texan\" gets or doesn't get, but rather who gets what I still have, and it won't be them. For slumbering lethargically away on their rights, people must buy foreign-made goods which are superior to American goods, all because they failed to control the corporate state. For example, in 1980,1 conducted what is now called \"cold fusion\" research. I obtained pronounced heat resu lts using several methods, one of which requires no input energy once the reaction is initiated. I do not describe it as \"fusion\". The process—now well-known, because later explored in Ut ah—was not good enough in comparison to better ways I developed, so I abandoned it. I then intenti onally leaked the process—with the addition of some ingenious misinformati on—to one whom I suspected to be a spy, because I had already been ripped off several times, and wanted the personal satisfaction of watching the thieves turn slowly in the wi nd of ridicule, as they choked on their own snot. In the form I leaked it, the process is a very inefficient use of the true principles involved. It will, when properly designed and constructed, produce a continuous, external current of 50 KW, almost indefini tely, using a non-consumed, cheap, easily obtained, 1-mole fuel sample. The Utah experiments yielded relatively smaller net gains in energy, because the scientists were attempting to proceed according to accepted methods. I watched them beat their brains out unsuccessfully trying to explain it, with ALIENS237"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"pleasure. Of course, there are re aders who will disbelieve me, refusing to co ncede that an amateur scientist could explain what the expert s have failed to explain. The answer can be found in my book, Occult Ether Physics. As it turned out, the spy, who is still a friend of mine, was working with some Mormons who were unconnected to the Trilateralist rats who had ripped me off befo re. He was sincerely doing what he thought to be the right thing, by taking the information to people who at least had the guts to try. No mon, no fun, I won. Poetic justice. They shouldn't have stolen my secrets, and denied credit where it was due. The spy is to be credited however, for properly interpreting the obvious undermining of my cred ibility by the state/Tr ilateralists, all the way back in 1980, as proof of the value of my inventions, and for placing the discovery into the public domain in the most spectacu lar way, which I believe was their intent. They sought my secrets after a very powe rful New Mexican had benefitted from a 1979 theft of one of my inventions, which worked very well. That beneficiary will eventually suffer a loss as a result of my present ac tions, and the \"domino effect\" applies to aligned interests. Another good example: My cousin (a ma thematical and electrical and computer engineering design genius), was pursuing an electrical engineering degree, and was forced by circumstances to drop out of co llege in 1957, taking an approximately $2.00 per hour job with Texas Instruments, in Dallas. Within a few months—when he was nineteen—six full-fledged engineers were re quired to execute his designs. In 1957, he showed me his original circuit design for the integrated circuit, drawn on a small scratch pad. For this discovery, Texas Instruments gave him a $100.00 bonus. This circuitry was incorporated into America's first satellite, and was a great \"miniaturization\" breakthrough. Credit was shared among two of six engineers who worked under Mark, building the things he designed. In 1970, T.I. fired him, b ecause he had no Ph.D.; he received no credit, and only a pathetic wage for his billion- dollar discoveries. T.I. also later marketed his personal, hand-built computer, which he left in his office when he moved out of it, as their \"Table Top Computer\". He received nothing for that either, and did not fight for his rights, although he now works for a company he crea ted, designing perhaps the world's best medical computers, which are used by the foremost medical facilities, including the Mayo Clinic, the Einstein Institute, and the San Francisco Medical Ce nter. He should be at least a multi-millionaire, but because he is a pre-occupied, somewhat reticent, creative genius, his rightful millions went to common thieves. So much for Mark Daniel Broussard, genius. The first major invention I lost, was one I invented in 1948, at age ten. My own father gave it to the patent thief. The thie f filed his application fo r patent in 1950, just after my twelfth birthday. This invention is everywhere. The second major invention loss was attributable to my own negligence, by al lowing a friend to u se it on his competition drag-racer, built in the shop of Jim Hall, th e well known car builder/r acer, in Midland. Texas, in 1967. It was appropriated by Hall and ended up at G.M., and was initially used on the Hall-built Ford Chaparral, Grande Prix, CanAm, and Indy cars driven by the Unser family of Albuquerque, where Jim Hall is from. The discovery is used throughout the high performance automotive and racing field today, and has even appeared on mam high-end sports cars. I discovered and test ed the first automotive \"ground-effects\" system, when I was fourteen years old, in 1952. ALIENS238"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"Such situations as these are commonplace. The few stories the public hears about, involve inventors who survive the onslaught of corporate intrigue and power, and find competent legal representation. From creativity studies 3 , it is known that creative geniuses are often neurotic to the point of being semi-disabled, as a direct result of their creative abilities, and vice-versa (that certai n disabilities and illnesses are often related to a higher creativity) 4 . In fact, a \"neurotic phase\" in the creative cycle, is generally recognized. This phase usually precedes th e \"productive phase\". In such phases, the consciousness is often altered to increase the probability for a \"bisociation of two or more previously unrelated matr ices, on the pre-conscious level\" 5 . The phases are often intentionally self-induced by creative individua ls, as the price they must pay for their creative productivity. While we all benefit from this phenomenon, the inherent naivete or disabilities of inventors makes them vulnera ble to con-artists, the government, doctors, lawyers, and corporate thieves. Where such individuals are looted from and denied reward, they may afterward pursue generally four courses of action, which are: (1) To continue in a more or less permanent state of neurosis, in which they no longer produce; or (2) continuing as usual, masochistically getting their teeth repeatedly kicked out; or (3) becoming 'normal', and never creating agai n; or (4) continuing to use their creative process to obtain revenge and to change the system. (I have opted for this last alternative, and advocate that ot her creative people do the same.) It is in the interest of everyone to see that our creative geniuses receive just rewards for the work they do. Failure to do so will leave our problems unsolved. If society punishes them, it is punishing itself. TRIUMVIRATE OF INJUSTICE The P.T.O. is the \"Vacuum Cleaner of Creative Minds\" for the cartels. The judiciary is the \"Extinguisher of Competing Claims\" for the cartels. The lawyers are the \"Hit Men of Problem People\" for the cartels. The cumulative effects of this triumvirate of injustice, is to enslave humanity, and to bog it down in its problems, with the cartels posing as the \"saviors apparent\", by dosing out whatever stolen \"solutions\" it chooses, at the most opportune moments of prolonged agony—usually created by them—calculated to extract the greatest degree of continued dependency. This cycle can be broken and rectified only by restoring justice for those who will provide the solutions. Ironically, the P.T.O. may find itself unknowi ngly registering some of my inventions in the future, under international patent treaties, but may never know which ones were mine. They've already issued several patents on some of my inventions anyway, stolen by their friends.

I hold no patents, so, at my option, it is only a matter of determini ng who gets to rip me off, by giving the edge to competitors of the 'domestic rats', rather than to allow them to rip me off, through the P.T.O. or other con-artists. Th e thieves who have profited from my prior inventions will know this is no joke. For a prolific, yet relatively poor, inventor like myself, there is no protection under the U.S. patent system as it now stands. I ha ve so many good inventions that there is no way for me to proceed with applications and disclosures, because the system is almost too expensive and time-consuming, even to pr ocess a single application, much less over a hundred. And the answer is not to provide fe deral funding for an army of legal creeps in Washington, to process the applications of \"poor inventors\", because that would only create increased abuse and leakage of patent secrets to the Illuminati. I could be swamped with interference proceedings on a single application, leaving all other applications abandoned on bureaucratic techni calities, such as failur e to respond in time, caused by judicial interferences. The P.T.O. has stated its rigid position on such interferences in my first application, and w ould not consider them, so I will no longer consider them. The P.T.O. therefore, alwa ys has the option of throwing the game in favor of the corporations, to unjustly enri ch and empower them. The system as it now stands cannot meet the constitut ional requirements, is unjust, and like the judiciary, will collapse under the weight of its own self-c reated bureaucratic flab, duplicity, incompetence, and deadwood. Where some of my inventions are composed of several novel elements, each of which would support an independent application, requiring conceivably months of work to segregate to the satisfaction of the P.T.O ., the problem is further complicated. In the case of one single application, over three y ears and considerable work and expense have been consumed. The U.S. government in genera l is to blame for this quandary. I cannot leave my work stored in notebooks, or in my mind, only to have the P.T.O. reject a future application as abandoned, on the basis that I have 'secreted' it away, when in reality, the past shows that I can't secret something away which I never had an adequate opportunity to disclose, or to protect after disclosure. They won't consider such a defense, since I tried it and know. So the P.T.O. has its rules, and I have mine. I was plagued by Trilater alist/Illuminati invention-thieves, who looked for opportunities to steal ot her multi-million-dollar discoverie s so they could get filthy rich. while I languished away in poverty and legal problems created by them, with my credibility destroyed by the corporate-state fascist judicial yeggs. Therefore, I wi ll simply see to it that the genera l public or foreign competitors end up with my inventions one way or the other, and there is nothing the corporate state can do to prevent it. If I am to be ripped off, I appoint the public or foreigners, or both, as beneficiaries, rather than my own government and its fascist corporate partners. I had rather give my discoveries away even to enem ies than to see traitors profit from them. In the future, this writing can be referenced in retrospect, to confirm the fact that a warning was given beforehand, stating how the probl em developed, and that the government refused to take any action until it was too late.

We can pl ay \"credibility roulette\", with this book (the pistol) pointed at its head (the most valuable secret of the Illuminati). It is not necessary that my book be take n seriously by the government, since, in response to my legal pleadings, the legal nu mskulls said that my requests that my constitutional rights be observed, protected a nd enforced, were all just \"fantasy and fiction\", and \"frivolous\".

The damage done to me by the P.T.O. and the New Mexico judiciary, is a symbol of their damage to all. Whether they justify their acts through phony-baloney double-think, judicial decrees or \"office actions\", I have been provoked into justifiably punishing them through rightful means, for the good of civilization, by exposing th em, withholding my future disclosures, and by disposing of my own cr eative products as I deem fit. in a way predicated to bring the maximum detriment to them and their kind, even at the future expense of millions of dollars lost to myself, which I will never see anyway, because of them.

ALIENS242"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"D: AMERICAN DISSIDENT TRIALS, MURDERS, TRIBULATIONS, AND MASSACRES Some readers may ask what this chapter has to do with flying saucers. This 'secret' is only one of many. The disease of secrecy thre atens to take over everything, until every citizen obtains information only on a \"need to know\" basis, just as if he were in the CIA. That is the logical conclusion of a totalitarian police state. This book is about how a jungle of LIES has been created, by perv erting all the instruments of a purported \"democratic\" society, for the ostensib le purpose of protecting something called \"national security\", but which, if left unchall enged, will eventually lead to our complete enslavement. At this very moment, I hear the roar of the jet engines of military fighter planes, as they greedily slurp up expensiv e fuel, when a flying saucer operates on practically nothing. To some deluded people, the roar of the jets is synonymous to \"protection\" and \"freedom\", but to me, it is the sound of \"waste\" and the \"draining away of the abundance created by the sweat and blood of the American People\". In the words of Patrick Henry, \"Is life so dear and peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery?\" When life-threatening violence is stir red up against you by the CIA, with law-enforcement personnel inst ructed to provide no protections, you cannot take matters into your own hands to obtain justice, becaus e that is what they want you to do, and almost anything you do might become an excuse to throw you into jail, where your life can be snuffed out in a minute. Though the things they are doing mark them as the lowest of sociopathic criminals, you must und erstand that the only way to defeat them is to refuse to make the wrong, impulsive move, so they can't depict you as a \"violent\", \"bad\", or \"mad\" person, and treat you accordingly. You must design effective countermeasures, an d carry them out. I once naively believed that, under the \"Anglo-American System of Jurisprudence\", only a \"real\" criminal could be convicted an d sent to prison. What a delusion! It came home to me in 1980, that in New Mexico, they can and do frame, convict, and send innocent people to prison, and that this is on e of the easiest places in America for them to get away with it. This is nothing new in America, witness the examples of Wilhelm Reich, Sacco and Vanzetti, Leonard Peltier, a nd a host of others. The only difference is, that the Feds have learned from experience, and do it slicker today, thus confining the knowledge of their criminal behavior to onl y a few dissidents and perhaps their trusted friends. A lot of what this book is about is how I managed to avoid a million pitfalls, and survived long enough to te ll you these things. To avoid legal entanglements, I intentionally excluded the names of many people, even after an attorney friend in Santa Fe advised me to include the names, on the ba sis that \"the truth\" is a \"good defense\" to a suit for libel. But I didn't hear him guarantee representation in case I was sued because of following his advice. I am sick of lawsuits. Putting in the names could provide a \"wedge\" for potential instigators of suits, to further impede my in forming you on the corporate-state Illuminati conspiracy. An unwanted libel suit against me, a pro se party, could enjoin my efforts. This book is not intended as lo cal petty gossip, or a local-type expose, to be applied only to the local scene, but is a handbook for analyzing and defi ning the same methodology at work everywhere.

And, of what use is a \"good defense\" to a lawsuit, when there are no honest attorneys to take cases before judges who get their marching orders from the Illuminati? We can turn the tables by denying them th e satisfaction of filing suits, to make money for attorneys, or to make them \"heroes\". We must boycott this fraudulent legal system. One's attorney can be compromised, inti midated, or just plain \"bought off, in several unsuspecting ways. One way is the \"r eferral service\", in which they are given another case, providing plenty of income ove r a longer period of time, with ultimately greater career benefits and prestige. Anot her way is to accuse them of \"Rule 11 violations\" (frivolity), threatening to drag their name through the mud of ethics and contempt proceedings, and hit them with fi nes and sanctions, etc., unless they drop the case and concede victory to the other side. Other ways are to use sex or drug inducements, or plain old physical threats or intimidations. The state tort claims liability act allows state-employed members of the A.G.'s staff to \"pay off' your attorney, in settlement of a claim against the state, withou t you ever knowing about it, dismissing the suit, while your attorney pockets the money. Th is is just plain old bribery, but they can and do get away with it. Another way is to appoint your attorney to a position such as county attorney of this or that county. Ever y single one of these tricks were used on attorneys employed by me. Once your eyes are opened to these tricks, the possibilities abound. The bottom line, however, is that most attorneys are yellow, money-grubbing Shylocks, who avoid controversies like the plague, except those they fabricate. \"Sacharov-type dissident trials\" in Amer ica are similar to those of the former Soviet system, and the Chinese Communist \"mass propaganda show-trials\". Of the two, the Chinese system is most like ours, prohibiting publicity in suppression cases, to avoid arousing public suspicions in a so-called \"d emocratic society\". The victim's rights to freedom of speech and press are often denied wi thout him ever realizin g it. In China that hardly becomes an issue. Our system is becoming more \"Chinese\". The CIA ingeniously creates \"Kafkaesque\" judicial harassment which is seemingly unrelated to the object, appearing to be 'random litigation', difficult to connect to its real source. Constantly tampered and stolen evid ence, missing, falsif ied, and incomplete records; constant set-ups, falsely induced s ituations and trickery; judgment executions, threats to confiscate and sell your persona l property, constant, unannounced visits to your home by sheriffs deputies and pr ocess servers; perjury and false witnesses, constant false allegations, personal attacks, assaults on credibility and character; induced breakup of one's family; sham trials, false contempt proceedings, compulsory appearances, interruption of work, har assing discovery proceedings and orders, reduction of earning capacity, fines, expenses, grillings over every detail of one's personal life and invasion of privacy; all gradually building a false record against an innocent victim, and a massive computer inform ation file which is readily available to the government criminals perpetuating the judi cial terrorism, so that any information which they wish to exploit can be instantly programmed into the next phase of their plans. In America, this can be harsh, be cause it is covered by the hypocritical illusions of \"freedom\" and \"due process\". Does this sound like America? It is and has been a reality for me, and it has been made to appear to be the result of \"property dealings\"! In reading this book, you should ask yourself if the kind of person I am, who woul d devote so much of his time to science, art, creativity, philosophy, and \"true justice\" , would be capable of creating 17 years of ALIENS244"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"litigation for himself, just so he could rema in poor, and be unable to realize anything from his dreams? Why would anyone who had never gotten anything out of any lawsuit, except less than was already his, have any reason to remain involved in court proceedings which in the past have only unjustly deprived him of time, money, energy, property, joy, life, and countless other things ? Very few, if any, of the \"newsworthy\" aspects of this abusive litigation were ever reported in the press, after the initial \"Big Bird\" publicity, since the guilty parties suppr essed publicity in subsequent harassments, knowing further wide publicity could arouse questions of legitimacy among ethical citizens, to possibly redound in my favor. It is immaterial as to whether or not a victim discovers the motive or identifies the true instigators, who are able to misuse the power of the state to conceal their crimes, the knowledge or evidence of which could prove a cause of action for violations of 42 USCS secs. 1985 and 1986 (Civil Rights Act). Ha! The vi ctim will be unable to continue the (undesired) conduct, and \"suing\" is out of th e question, because the harassment takes all his time, energy and money. Designed to disturb bis mind and autonomous nervous system—like the attacks of S.S. \"psych iatrists\" in pre-WW II Nazi Germany—the victim's inability to pursue the (undesired) c onduct is the object of the litigation. The negative reinforcements are designed to create \"conditione d (neuromuscular) responses\", like Pavlov's dogs. The proces s is designed to destroy the victim's individual identity and will power, by invading the privacy of his mind and body, through \"object lessons\", compelling him to take the desired course of action or non-action, as if he had done so willfully. After the psychopolitical earmarks of th e process became obvious, I became determined to produce this book, once and for al l, even if I had to write, illustrate, print, bind, and distribute it myself. As it turned ou t, I actually did all that in my original edition of 1993, and first reprinting of 1994. I would like to point out that, the techniques through which the CIA has sought to perfect \"mind control\", is best demonstrat ed by experiments in which they actually created \"Manchurian candidates\", such as John Charles Whitman, who shot over 22 people beneath the tower of the Main Building at the University of Texas, in the summer of 1967. By directing certain psychological harassments and conditionings toward particular unsuspecting subjects who meet psychological profiles revealing their vulnerabilities, they subliminally induce them to follow a certain course of action. Since I was present during the Whitman massacre, and almost got hit by one of his bullets, the situation got my attention. Did you know th at as a Marine, Whitman was trained with Lee Harvey Oswald, at the same Marine \"assassin school\" in Japan? Whitman, from Florida, was also one of those \"good Catholic boys\" who had made it to Eagle Scout. At the time of the massacre, he was being treate d at the U.T. medical center, by the same CIA psychiatrist—a Dr. Smith— who had previously treated Jack Ruby while he was in jail in Dallas, for killing Oswald...until Ruby di ed of cancer of the knee, thus neatly tidying loose ends, such as the possibility that he might talk. Whitman also had a terminal tumor (in his brain), planted by in jection, which he supposedly knew nothing about, but I believe he found out about it. Tw o murders, two tumors , same psychiatrist, and the same CIA connections and training. As was pointed out by Jim Garrison, former New Orleans D.A., David Feme had engaged in extensive medical research on behalf of the CIA, developing field met hods for causing cancer in unsuspecting victims (such as giving them an injection of turpentine). Does this ring any bells? ALIENS245"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"In order to discover how to defeat the Illuminati and our crooked judiciary, one can refer to a book given to me by the Air Force in 1958, written by Duane Thorin 6 , a former \"psychopolitical\" victim. Thorin was a Navy warrant officer and he licopter pilot, who based his book on his experiences as a P.O.W. in North Korea in the 1950s. He was also the person who inspired Jame s Michener's The Bridges at Toko Ri (which was made into a movie starring William Holden). The fictional hero/victim in Thorin's book discovered that the psychopolitical \"interrogators\" used \"mood control\". After di scovering what a victim wanted most of all—such as a simple bar of soap, because the prisoner wanted to bathe—they deprived him of it, thus controlling his moods, in tended to psychologically break down and override his conscious resist ance, until he gave them what they wanted. The interrogators concentrated their \"work\" on leaders. This method worked on many, if not most victims, but not on the hero in Thorin's book, who discovered that he could exercise his individual discipline and knowledge to defeat the criminals, either by pretending to want something he did not wa nt, conditioning himself to want nothing, or simply playing a cat-and-mouse gu essing game with the criminals. In my case, they were firmly convinced th at real estate was the way to control me. However, \"...the wheels of justice turn ex ceedingly slow, but gr ind exceedingly fine\", and since judicial psychopolitics and abuse ar e not \"justice\", the \"grinding wheels\" of our judicial system are crumbling and running out of time as the system is being squandered on abuse, and is not respected by anyone, even the people who run it. Truth and justice can flow from falsity, but lies and injustice which are artificially made to flow from the truth, will eventually destroy the system, demoralize those who run it, encourage defections, and destroy the liars, by invoking the wrath of the public. Today, the self-esteem of lawyers and judicial professionals, and respect for them by the public, is at an all-time low. The public hates them, and a revolution is at hand. The CIA motive in my case, was clearly to conceal flying saucer and other alternative technology, and to coerce my co mpliance to their wishes, by psychologically imprisoning me through judicial abuse, while silencing me with false contempt orders and litigation ad infinitum, c oncealed from the public by s uppression of publicity, lies in the court records, and o ccasionally lies in the press. During the most intense six-year period of this litigation, my typical day consisted of my arising at around 4:30 A.M. with pleadings boili ng in my mind, to commence drafting the day's pleadings. I would then begin typing them up, while checking legal authority carefully to be sure my points were correct. As the clock moved toward the deadline—I had to complete the typing by 4:00 P.M., eleven and a half hours later—I would be working at a feverish pitch which ba rely left time to travel to Santa Fe, to reproduce pleadings, to serve them on the op posing side, and to file them with the District Clerk. As an example of the kind of energy and research the CIA puts into these kinds of activities, I present the following facs imile news clipping from around 1980: 6 Duane Thorin, A Ride to Panrmuniom.

She then offered a \"deal sweetener\", saying that, if I accepted the offer, her associate, a (CIA) psychiatric nurse named Pat, who worked in an Albuque rque hospital and lived in the Sandias, would provide me with 'any kind or amount of drugs I wanted', at CIA expense. As I later learned, the CIA had sent this nurse to our O.S.O, meetings in 1966. This kind of CIA hypocrisy has now come to the attenti on of the American public, and they want it stopped. Believe it or not, the 'jus tification' used by the CI A for keeping O.S.O. under surveillance, was because Howard Rourke, th e fictional hero in Ayn Rand's novel, The Fountainhead, had used dynamite to destroy a building he had designed! By some twist of 'reason', they used a fictional 'i ncident' from a novel, to construe our philosophical/literary study group as a potential threat to the 'national security'! The sickening truth was, that our very reasonabl e group (which advocated 100% laissez-faire capitalism, along with the dismantling and ab olition of the CIA) unknowingly conducted its weekly philosophical discourses for the ul timate benefit of the CIA spies sent to keep an eye on us. Seeing no mad bombers in our midst, and knowing a good thing when they saw it, they just glommed onto us like par asites, using us as a surrogate 'think tank'.

I had alr eady lost a great deal of these metals in some accidents along the way, but in 1979, I had a 99.9% pure 80 ounces minimum of iridium, va lued at approximately $80,000.00 at the time. Due to my lack of knowledge, I was unable to identify the metal until Oct. 23, 1979. The only person I told about this, was the Paperclip-connected ne ighbor, who had gained my confidence. Meanwhile, only his yegg, named \"Dave\", knew the location of the metal in my home. The metal was in the form of finely divided powder, which only he could have identified, or known the location of. In early 1979,1 had been tricked into another legal involvement, by the yegg, Dave, who had once done an ingenious arson job for the CIA in the Caribbean.

He had al so worked on a sheet metal crew with my ALEENS248"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"former father-in-law, at the Brown and Root shipyard in Houston, during WWII. As far as I could determine, they were all closet homosexuals. Dave was not a Mason, but the rest of them were. He was also the onl y one of the group who had never become a millionaire. Brown and Root apparently had a whole cluster of 4-F closet queen Masons working in their shipyard sheet metal shop, one of whom was from the Brown family itself. The 'defense work' allo wed them to avoid the draft. It seemed to me that the connective thread here was a closet homos exuality within the good Ol' boy Masonic network. If this sounds like sexual bigotry, plea se bear in mind that these guys are not civil libertarians, but coercive monopolist crook s who will kill to conceal tiheir secrets. The real estate fraud was induced by Dave through a young man—also named \"Dave\"—who sold his body to some of these closet queens, and who has since been sent to the nut-house several times. As I overheard Dave remark to the young male whore, \"First set him up, then knock him down\" (ref erring to me). The ma le whore was also a student of a Santa Fe (closet bisexual) C.F.R./Illuminati/naturopathic physician, whose Chicago father sold platinum metals to the U.S. government. Th e neighbor knew I was involved in platinum metals re search, and hired Dave to in vestigate this for him and a group from Chicago, including the naturopath and his father. Many of these Chicago associates were Europeans who were give n new identities under Operation Paperclip, following Hitler's 1945 stalemate deal with 'us'. The operative's approach was to get me to go out to remote mining locations to explore for minerals and stake out claims. As any con artist know s, the 'bait' is a promise of something to the 'mark' (me), wh ich in this case, was the claims. It was contemplated that, while in the process of pr ospecting, I would eventually disclose the details of my platinum research, source of mi neral concentrates, and method of recovery. The claims which I staked out, however, were not for platinum metals, but for a 97% pure silica sand. In this respect I had developed a new and cheaper mass-production method for the manufacture of solar-voltaic chips, which were also more efficient than previous ones. The details of this research were also disclosed, along with the location of my purified indium, and the preliminary plans which I had prepared on my new solar-voltaic system, based on th e sands. Dave was a tall, skinny, over 60, southern redneck hick, who was an unlikely candidate for closet queen or industrial spy. It seems the CIA prefers \"closet queens\" or other people who seek to hide skeletons in their closets, because of the bl ackmail potential, as a means of CIA coercive control over operatives. On June 14, 1979 (my birthday again), Dave came by to go to the claims, but it rained, so he came again on the 15th, to go to the San Pedro Mountains, to do some 'work on the claims'. After cons iderable walking, we return ed to the pickup for a rest and some water. Dave, who was diabetic, dran k fruit juice, as I drank water from a large canteen. The water tasted strange and moldy, and I wondered why a diabetic would drink fruit juice rather than water, since it contai ned sugar. We returned to our work, and I walked across the claim to check a location poin t, as Dave sat near the truck, nervously clutching my bag, in which I usually carried a pistol, Little did I know, but he was just waiting for me to die. This was only one of several attempted murders, and I have always wondered if an occult principle was involved, since the attempts were often made on or near my birthday. While walking along near a rock ledge, I sudd enly passed out, fe ll off the ledge onto the top of a large clump of cholla cactii, an d literally impaled the lower part of my body ALIENS249"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"on them. The excruciating pain and rush of adrenaline revived me from my unconsciousness, and I painfully removed mysel f from the clump, and extracted as many of the spines as I could—some of which pierced to a depth of over an inch—and returned to the truck to pull out many more. Wh ile bending over the seat in the truck, I discovered a plastic 'baggie' in the floor board, containing crushed Angels de Dios (small, white, highly poisonous mushrooms). Their smell was identical to the moldy smell and taste of the water I had drank from the canteen, the taste of a fungus. In the succeeding few days, during which I experienced stomach cramps and mild hallucinations which were symptomatic of mushroom poisonings, I realized incredibly that the operative had spiked the water with the Angels de Dios in a murder attempt. On Oct. 25, 1979, two days after telling th e neighbor about my identification of the iridium, Dave entered my house and stole my metals, along with my plans for the solar-voltaic system. Within about two weeks, the neighbor' s crime-partner in Michigan announced \"his\" discovery and patent application on my process. On Oct. 26, 1979,1 received a call from the neighbor, who invite d me to his home, where he asked me to become a \"partner\" with him, \"...to process the black sands for platinum metals\" (with proof in hand, this offer showed that he not only hired the operative, but due to their frustrated efforts to discover my source of platinum concentrates, had mistakenly concluded that my source was from black sands). I did not respond. Within about three or four days, I received a call from Steve Reynolds, a Chicagoan who was the New Mexico State Engineer. Reynolds explained that the had been requested by the neighbor and a group of \"Chica go investors\", to urge me to accept an offer by them to back me in a \"metallurgical laboratory\", to be built on my property. I did not respond. (The \"property\" involved was later taken away in the abusive lawsuits.) In early 1980, the neighbor invited me to a gathering at his hous e, attended by the naturopath and his wife. The offer was repe ated to me, and again, I did not respond. In October, 1980,1 was again invited to the neighbor's house, attended by a larger group, including the Chicago associates refe rred to by Reynolds (who were connected to what was once Meyer Lansky's \"Chicago Sy ndicate\", unbeknowest to Reynolds, who were cozy with the CIA). The neighbor and hi s associates threatened me by saying \"You don't burn the mob\". I answered that I coul d not possibly \"burn the mob\", since I had no dealings with them. They then proceeded to tell me all of the bad things which 'the mob' could do to a person. Again, I did not a ccept their offer. \"The Mob\" was the CIA. In 1982, a second murder attempt was made , coinciding with the occupancy of the 'cocaine cartel' tenant w ho was the Columbian doctor's former wife. The would-be murderers worked with a St. Vincent's Hosp ital nurse (whose father was a Dade County, Florida banker involved in money laundering). The nurse was also married to a Columbian. Incredibly, all these people were also former members of the U.S. Peace Corps in Colombia, which is how they became associated with Klaus Barbie's cocaine cartel. The tenant furnished antibiotics supp lied by her former husband, while the nurse furnished diseased sputum fro m the hospital. They attempted to grow a \"killer germ\", using yogurt as the medium, into which the germs and antibiotics were added. This concoction was added to some food and fed to me, on June 14, 1982 (my birthday again). My reaction the following morning, w as a congested and sore throat, and yellow bile discharges.

The communist lady and her live-in boyfriend (a Hearst heir), left a candl e burning against a wall, in an arson attempt foiled only by my disc overy, just in time. The criminal investigators for the Santa Fe Sheriffs department refused to allow me to file reports, either on the 1979 or th e 1982 murder attempts, or related criminal activities. All of these people were among those I referred to in Chapter II (under \"I Meet Torquemada and the Medellin Cartel\") , who were involved in the drug dealing, communist/fascist politics, and money laundering, using straw-owners throughout Santa Fe County, the \"Banana Republic\" of North America. In October, 1983,1 was visited for the firs t time in New Mexico, by my 19-year-old son from my first marriage. My former in -laws—who were such great 'pals' with George Bush and wife, from their 1950s Od essa, Texas days—had managed, through threats, intimidation, political power and subt erfuge, and the pure weight of money, to break off all contacts betw een my children and me after 1976, followed by a 1979 disappointment of a promised visit which wa s canceled. The sudden 1983 call from my son had re-established those broken contact s, but only for criminal purposes, I would later discover. Between 1970 and 1976, during the trips I ma de to visit my children in Odessa, I had stayed at my parent's house. Ector County Sheriffs deputies would sometimes come to the house at night unannounce d, enter the house without knocking or permission, search the house, and attempt to intimidate me or provoke a physical response, without probable cause, a warrant, or even a knock on the door. I knew that the Ector County Sheriff at that time wa s connected to the Chicago Mob also. You would be surprised to know how I came to know this fact. Leading up to June 14, 1979 (my 41st birthd ay), my children had arranged to visit me in New Mexico for the fi rst time, and I was very exci ted and happy about that. The in-laws canceled those plans at the last minut e. The following day, the first of the four murder attempts was made by Dave, the old pa l of the ex father-in-law, also connected to the neighbor, all being connected to the CIA. These traumatic ev ents led to a break between my children and me. They were hol ding my children hostage to coerce my joining into the Mob/CIA operations. I was then \"excommunicated\" by the in -laws from their church (the Eisenhower Church of Christ, in Odessa, Texas), to wh ich I had never belonged. My children were forced to attend this open \"excommunication ri tual\", thus subjecting them to Christian- Satanist \"ritual abuse\", using the entire congregation to buttress it. Though I am opposed to such \"witchcraft\", there was not hing I could do about it, since I didn't know about it until four years later. The children we re forbidden by the church to associate with me after being raised by me as good, clean and clear-thinking At heists, for the first six and seven years of their lives, w ithout psychological problems or other complications. The children were suddenl y and forceably twisted completely around backward by this archaic and alien Satani st/Christian (they always co-exist, being mutually dependent) \"religion\", which wors hipped a grisley 2,000-year-old myth and non-existent dead body of \"Christ\", based on the fantasy of \"Chr istianity\", created ALIENS251"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"originally by Josephus (A.K.A., General Arius Calpurnius Piso) 7 , on the old Luciferian model, to trick the Jewish revolutionaries in Rome and Jerusalem, into accepting a wimp \"messiah\" intended to make them docile. My son later told me that for all those years, his grandmother forced him to sleep on the floor, in a closet, in a sleeping bag. That was his \"room\". This from greedy, stingy, sadistic \"Christians\", who were worth millions. The last time I had visited with him in 1976, he was twelve, and a world class swimmer, the champion of the West Texas Aquatic Association. He had Olympic promise. The following year, at age 13, he began to \"mainline\" (to intravenously inject) methamphetamine, and continued to do so for several years, during which the \"Christi ans\" concealed this information from me. In 1982, in a sudden (and suspicious) turn about, my son was \"sent\" to me, not to visit, but to attempt to get damaging information on me, so they could 'put me in jail', to atone for their guilt. As a good example of \"...good Christian upbringing\", my son had become a \"meth-head\". They wanted to make it look like a case of \"...like father, like son..\"—to misplace th eir guilt on me. During my son's first visit, he made secr et trips to the residence of a well-known Santa Fe judge, who lives in the nearby El dorado subdivision, wher e he was encouraged to make out false police reports against me. He later admitted that the grandparents had arranged it all, and had threatened to disi nherit him. The trip had been planned between the judge and the in-laws, with the promise th at my son could gain 'penance' for what he had 'done to them', by helping them to 'get me'. So there was the victim of heinous Christian-Satanist child abusers, who had tu rned to drugs, his life practically wrecked for good, seeking 'forgiveness' from the crimin ally insane \"pillars of the community\", who had by their insanity, driven him into the streets, in his childhood. A large part of the political arrangements in this scenario, were being carried out by the first cousin of the \"Oil Queen\", the retired Texas Ranger, George Renfrew (who also worked with the CIA), who was also the brother to my first wife's cousin's wife. I had actually broken bread with this man on seve ral Thanksgivings, in Crockett, Texas. My son was apparently making clandestine visits to obtain instructions from this 'Strange Ranger'. I eventually found out about some of this, when a weirdo tenant filed a suit against me, and attempted to use the false repor ts against me in court. On realizing that the State of New Mexico was highly liable to me for the blatant CIA fabrications, the evidence was withheld by an embarrassed de tective, who then sought to conceal the identity of the judge and the retired Texas Ranger, whose presence in the arrangement I was already aware of. The very gravity of th is monstrous plot were about as outrageous a violation of a citizen's rights by high government authorities, as I have ever had personal knowledge of, and yet they happened to me. At this time, I was having difficulty in separating things which I knew were connected to my former in-laws, from those connected to the CIA, until a succession of events revealed that they were all connected to the CIA, because my former in-laws had connections to George Bush, who was direct or of the ClA, and had several high level CIA employees in their family. Out of what appear on the surface to be \"private-public conflicts\", one may be led to more closely examine the facts, and to realize that the CIA is not a \"public\" institution, but a private one, created under the directions of the Federal Reserve Bank, and the group of other private bankers who perpetrated the fraud of the 7 Abelard Reuchlin, The True Authorship of the New Testament, The Abelard Reuchlin Foundation.

During this time, my former wife was s hot at along highway 285, by the retired \"Texas Ranger\", as shown by the followi ng facsimile clipping from The New Mexican, which I entitle \"The Big Ol' Bad Ranger Takes a Shot at a Pregnant Woman\": The above can be attributed to th at 'nice man'—George Bush—once in Washington, as a favor to an old \"A-hole buddy\", to motivate me to \"go back to my first wife\". Strange bedfellows indeed. After the shot at my wife, she immediatel y became ill and miscarried our first child she was carrying within a couple of days, and almost died in the process. So the Ranger had actually committed the murder of an unborn child, and almost killed my wife as well. Perhaps that was his intent. I found it hard to believe that the Range rs and the CIA would employ a man who would shoot at a pregnant woman, and be i nvolved in a plot to drive away my second wife, so my first wife could \"get me back\". The plot was so bizarre that it reminded me of one of those old movies where some hillbil lies in the Ozarks went out with their guns to bag 'em a husband for their homely sister. These people seemed to be too stupid to take \"No!\" for an answer. They failed to unde rstand that even if they ran off my wife, and offered me the position of \"King of th e Whole Goddamned World\", I still wouldn't \"go back\" to my first wife. During my son's second visit, in January of 1983,1 was almost killed for a third time, by a Santa Fe naturopath and his wi fe, who had been dosing me with minute quantities of arsenic for years, and finally gave me a couple of larger doses, to \"send me home\" for good. This couple, whose parents we re connected to the C.F.R., were closely connected to the Paperclip-connected neighbor who hired the first and second assassins in the 1979 and 1982 attempts, and sued me in 1987. In January of 1983,1 went to the naturopath to obtain relief from back pains caused by work. The doctor applied accupressure a nd a massage oil to my back, which seemed to contain abrasive grains of something. That was probably not obvious to the doctor, since the back is more sensitive than the hands. The doctor probably thought the arsenic compound was so finely ground that I couldn't feel it. I simply though that was the way ALIENS253"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"it was supposed to feel. He asked me to come back the following week for a \"second treatment\", which I thought was odd, but on his advice did so, on Feb. 4, 1983. Between the first and second treatments, I had bloody bowel discharges which the doctor said was \"...your system, flushing out harmful substances\". Little did I know, but they were the symptoms of arsenic poisoni ng. During the second treatment, the doctor began to ask me personal que stions regarding tax matter s, which I thought was odd, especially when I discovered that his wife wa s also present, hiding beneath the covers of an adjacent treatment table. Again, the oil applied to my back had an abrasive effect. In the evening following the second treatment, I began feeling nauseous, with pain across my kidney region and liver, as if someone had placed a steel band around my lower rib cage and tightened it. I awoke in th e middle of the night with dry heaves and yellow bile. At that point, in deep despair and pain, I knew that something was drastically wrong. I remembered a convers ation I once had with the doctor about \"homeopathy\", in which he had remarked that \"arsenic is easy to kill someone with because it is cumulative, and you can give them only a pinhead amount each day, over a long period of time, and eventually kill them whenever they reach the toxic limit.\" At that point I realized the massage oil contai ned a granular form of arsenic which the doctor had obtained from the mineral formations at Ojo Caliente, a natural spring, where he often obtained such minerals supposedly for his homeopathy work, and had ground it with his mortar and pestle and added it to the oil. We called the Poison Control Center and confirmed my symptoms as arsenic poison ing, and I immediately took a hot bath to remove as much of the oil and arsenic as poss ible, and returned to bed. The bath should have been a cold one, because the hot bath only opened up my pores for the arsenic to enter faster, I now believe. At 5:00 A.M., my wife dragged me unconscious from bed, and with the help of her seven-year-old son, got me into the car and rushed me to the St. Vincents Hospital emergency ramp, from wh ich I was wheeled into the E.R. in a dehydrated, semi-conscious st ate, with no pulse. They i mmediately began rehydrating me with electrolyte salt solution, as I began to go into convulsions. Three litres later, I was completely normal, the electrolytes not only having rehydrate d me, but were the perfect chelation solution to completely eliminate all the arsenic from my system. I felt wonderful, where only moments befo re I was on the verge of death. On learning that their murder attempt ha d been barely defeated by our timing and awareness of their plot, the natu ropath eventually began to suffer remorse, calling me up on two separate occasions to confess, and to seek my forgiveness. I recorded both of these calls, then duped the tapes. The second call came around a week after the 1987 lawsuit filed by the neighbor, and he was afra id of being drawn into it. I believe my phone was tapped by the neighbo r, who overheard th e calls and became worried that the naturopath was crumbling. The lady sneak-thi ef was hired again to steal the tapes, but got only the dupes, at the same time that sh e got the aerial photo trial exhibits, which cleared the way for the Paperclip-co nnected neighbor to win his suit. Around two weeks later, on a flight from Kathmandu to Nepal, the couple's Lufthansa airliner was seen to explode on the descending glidepath on the eastern side of the Himalayas, over Burma. Call it \"poetic justice\" if you will, but I call it a \"cowboy hit\", by people who sought to conceal the tr uth. The naturopath and his wife, along with 22 others, were killed.

His grandfather, who had lunc h every week with the D.A. on a regular basis, simply had him put away because he had become an embarrassment to him as a deacon of the church. I found out about my son's conviction over six months later, through neighbors who we re suing me.

It seems that nothing invites the interest of a sadist more than a person minding his own business. The perfect chump. The ideal scapegoat. In the 1870s, Jack Wilson, the Kiowa-Cree sachem (A.K.A., \"Wovoka, the Paiute Messiah\", founder of the Ghost Dance Cult) married into the Richardson Clan, in Anahuac, Texas, becoming James M. Rich ardson's son-in-law. Richardson ordained Wilson as a preacher of the Primitive Baptist Church, and Wilson in turn ordained Quanah Parker, all on the same day. Thus was created the Native American Church, complete with the peyote sacraments of Wilson. Richardson was my great-great-grandfather. We have an old family photo showing Wilson when he was in his early twenties, several years before the earliest photo of the Smithsonian's. Most of the American Indian scholars have erroneous or distorted histories of how the Native American Church started, and have no history at all that Jack Wilson ever lived in Texas or had a family there. They usually trace the church's origin to Quanah Parker, failing to realize that Parker was ordained by Jack Wilson. The Primitive Baptist Church was originally called the \"Primiti ve Baptist Church of England\" when the Richardson's originally settled in the coloni es in Virginia, since Benjamin Richardson was originally a Tory. After the American Re volution, The Richardsons were run out of the colonies, and settled in Mississippi. Af terwards, James M. Richardson fought as an American in the battle of 1812 in Mississippi, during the British invasion, and distinguished himself militarily, so the \"...of England\" was dropped along with the Richardson Tory sympathies. James M. Rich ardson then married a Natchez princess and moved to Texas, founding the fi rst Protestant mission at Buna. Jack Wilson apparently came into Texa s to gather peyote for his Kiowa-Cree- Paiute ceremonies, and somehow fell in wi th the Richardson clan, was ordained by ALIENS255"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"Richardson as a minister, and married Ri chardson's half-Indian daughter. After fathering some kids, he disappeared back to his native Nevada, where he founded the Ghost Dance Cult, which contained elements of the original Primitive Baptist Church fused with ancient Kiowa teachings. The family apparently never realized what had happened to him. Quanah Parker, a half-A nglo Comanche, went on to found the Native American Church, including Wilson's peyote teachings. It is my belief that the Kiowa are related to what Homer, the Gr eek poet, referred to as the Akiavoi or Achians, which to me means \"East Quay People\". As such, they shared the ancient Egyptian religions beli efs which were common to many ancient peoples. The Ghost Dance Reli gion taught that the Indians could \"...dance all the dead Indians back to life\", and in the meanwhile, the Whites would shrink until they disappeared. This theme contains elements from the ancient Egyptian religion, with significant variations. The U.S. Army officers did not like this idea, even though no violence was advocated. Ironically, Wilson's movement—a sort of \"American Gandiism\"—eventually resulted in the senseless massacre of thousa nds of peaceful, innocen t, already defeated Indians, by the U.S. Army, particularly at Wounded Knee, South Dakota. Clearly, the Illuminati did not want peace. They wanted the old 'fighting' Indians, so they could slaughter them. The technique is always the same. Bring in a 'new' enforcer, unfamiliar with and fearsome of the Indians (or other targets). Savage the dignity of a leader, by demanding compliance to something which serves merely as the provocation of a refusal, as the pretext for a violent 'enfor cement', as 'justification' for murder or genocide, the same as with the Waco mass acre, Tianenmen Square, or Wounded Knee. I finally concluded, after being judicially tortured, imprisoned and impoverished by the CIA, that there just ain't no justice. To the Indians following Wounded Knee, the written and spoken word—in the guise of fict ion, poetry, prose, or mythology—was a way to reach out for sanity, since protection by \"law enforcement\" authorities—from the violence of thugs induced by their bosses—was systematically denied. Yet it was merely the spoken word, singing and dancing which led to the extermination of the Souix leadership. A helpless warrior in the traditional sense, with his hands tied from doing what is rational and just, coul d be depicted in the most unfavorable light, like a Crazy Horse, and shot to pieces. But I knew that I would have the last la ugh. He laughs best who laughs last. I have the lasting satisfaction of knowing how bitter it will be for small and cowardly men to look back on their evil lives as they approach death, futilely searching for worthy deeds, only to come face to face with themselves as lowly cowards, with criminal genes from degenerate parents, educated in corrupt sc hools, destined to waste their meaningless lives taking empty pleasure in filth, degradat ion, lies, gangsterism, and ill-gotten dollars. And what an inspiration for their children! Criminals breeding more criminals. When I was around 13, Max Evans, the western writer (who has a large dose of Indian blood), gave me a young bald eagle with a broken wing, to nurse back to health. We placed a splint on his wing, and I kept him until he was strong enough to fly, then set him free. Perhaps a year later, in the Davi s Mountains over a hundred miles to the west, as I walked with a group of other Scouts through Apache chief Victorio's last stronghold, the eagle appeared and circle d over my head, whistling shrilly, before perching on a nearby cliff to screech out to me, as the other Scouts watched in amazement.

I have never been able to approve of eagles in zoos.

If a bird prefers a cage to the freedom of the skies, he must depend on others for his food, or else he dies; but the death of the spirit is the saddest loss of all, for a mind which never rises can surely never fall. To fly among the clouds or the limbs of a tree, to land and mate and build a nest, and raise a family; to love the other birds, being happy to be free, is the only life a bird should live, the only way to be. For we humans, our mind is our sky, and independent thoughts are the wings on which we fly; there are people locked in cages, their minds soaring free, while prisoners outside the cag es have thrown away the key. ALIENS257"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"THE KENNEDY EXAMPLES At around 11:00 A.M., Nov. 20, 1963 (two days prior to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy), I had just arri ved at my American history class at Sam Houston State University, in Huntsville, Te xas, taught by professor Glynn Turner. The girl who sat behind me—a Mi ss Rather (newsman Dan Ra ther's younger sister)—had brought a copy of the San Antonio Light to class. The headline was something like \"J.F.K. TO BE IN DALLAS IN TWO DAYS\", with the Kennedy motorcade route advertised on the front page. I was somewh at familiar with the Texas School Book Depository neighborhood, since I had applied for work at a printing company in an adjoining building, in late 1962. As a boy, my \"blood brother\" was Ch arles \"Dusty\" Warren, II, a Cheyenne-Cherokee cross, who was also the son of the Chief of Secret Service for presidents Truman and Eisenhower. Mr. Warr en had absorbed five would-be assassin's bullets, in several attempts upon the li ves of those two presidents. Through my friendship with Dusty, I was somewhat famili ar with some basic security precautions established by his father, such as, that under the circumstances, a motorcade route should not be advertised. I also knew that, in a city such as Dallas, Secret Service agents would normally have been stationed in at least every other building or house along the way, and that, in no case, would the limousine be an open-topped convertible, especially where so many high buildings and potential a ssassin's perches existed, in a large city having a recent history of a ssassination attempts and other violence over politics. The legendary loyalty and bravery of the Cheyenne made the choice of Dusty's father as Secret Service Chief a good one. Unfortunately, Mr. Warren was replaced during the Kennedy presidency, although he apparently remained on the security team. On Nov. 22, 1963, since Dallas literally s eethed with people having motives to kill Kennedy, it was a wisely chosen city for the assassination, with so many likely suspects to blame. For example, a di sgruntled Madam Nhu, of Viet Nam, was in Dallas, brought there by anti-Kennedy political supporters. Her husband, Ngo Dinh Nhu, and his brother, the American-backed leader of Viet Nam, Ngo Dinh Diem, had been brutally and incompetently murd ered by CIA Station Chief Willia m Colby, and agent E. Howard Hunt, on Nov. 1, 1963, supposedly on orders of J.F.K. Ironically, Hunt was photographed at the Kennedy assassination site three weeks later, near the \"grassy knoll\", just after ri fle shots were fired from it. Dallas resident, General Edwin Walker, graduate of N.M.M.I. and of West Point Military Academy (and the youngest American commander to enter th e Po Valley of Northern Italy, during WW II) had been kicked out of the Army by Kennedy, and had written a book saying it was because of his patriotic, an ti-Communist views, and J ohn Birch Society membership. There were scads of Cuban refugees, and veterans of the Bay of Pigs fiasco. There was Jack Ruby (a former Marxist- Leninist from Russia, later 'turned' and recruited by the CIA), who had been fingered by Bobby Ke nnedy in his book, as the key Chicago union figure who had set up the hit of a union boss, in order to enable the Mob to take over the Chicago union (there's the Chicago Mob agai n!). The CIA knew a 'good thing' when they saw it, a virtual Pandora's box of varied possibilities to cover up their assassination of Kennedy. On Nov. 20,1963,1 knew these things. On seeing the headline and motorcade route, I picked up the paper, stood up, and said \"They are going to kill J.F.K. in Dallas, day after tomorrow, right here\" (pointing to ALIENS258"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"the street in front of the Book Depository). Incredibly, the professor and our entire class engaged in a 50-minute discussion of the Kennedy assassination, on Nov. 20, 1963, two days before it occurred, within 200 miles of Dallas. In another incredible coincidence, Glynn Turner's (the professor's) brother, Matt Turner, would later be identified by New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison, as the CIA agent sent out of Washington after th e assassination, to clean up 'loose ends' (i.e., to eliminate any witnesses who could tie the CIA into the killing). Most of these \"loose ends\" were various and sundry scum-bag s, prostitutes, petty criminals and other borderline characters, who had various pi eces of knowledge which implicated the CIA, through the many people who were to be e xposed in the eventual investigation. The 'coincidental' killings and mysterious deaths of so many of these people is what raised so many eyebrows during the ensuing controversy, following the assassination. Turner soon became the Bexar County (San Antonio area) Democratic party Chairman, appointed by you-know-who. A few days after the assassination, the pr ofessor Glynn Turner invited me over for supper. Conveniently, Turner's brother-in-law, a Navy admiral, was there, in uniform, to ask me some questions, cent ering primarily around how I came up with the idea that Kennedy would be killed in Dallas, two days before it happened. I realized in retrospect that the 'supper' was actually an O.N.I. de-briefing, to determine whether I possessed personal knowledge of an assassination 'c onspiracy'. The fact that I possessed no personal knowledge of a conspiracy, probably saved my life, I realized in retrospect. My best answer was that all of the apparent official indicia were there, to point my mind in the direction of an \"insid er-job\" assassination, so my prediction was based on probability. In the televised films of the assassination, I could see an agent climbing up on the trunk of the presidential limous ine, in an attempt to shie ld Jacqueline Kennedy, then pounding his fist on the trunk after it was too late to do anything—a 'frustration-gesture' which said \"I told you so!\". It was more likely that Mr. Warren had been replaced as the head of Secret Service because they didn't want the wiley old Cheyenne to throw any tomahawks into thei r well-oiled assassination machinery. Had his procedures been followed, the assassin ation would probably have failed, though he had never faced such a concerted conspiracy in any of the three attacks against Truman and Eisenhower. After the arrest of Lee Harvey Oswa ld, everything followed a classic K.G.B. \"A-Apparat\" (\"Assassination-Ap paratus\") pattern, copied fr om the old Soviet N.K.V.D. As Oswald's 'second', Jack Ruby had devel oped 'sleeper agent' status with the Dallas police, and during a prisoner transfer at which he was conveniently present, he performed a classic Soviet-style assassina tion of Oswald, shoving his .38 directly up under his rib-cage, before 'gut-shooting' him, thus insuring little chance of his survival. This was S.O.P. under the old K.G.B. rules, after the apprehension of Oswald, to shield the assassins (in this case, the Illuminati /government plotters) from Oswald's possible testimony, but according to evidence discover ed and relayed to the F.B.I. by Oswald himself, two days before Kennedy was killed , it appears in retrospect to be the way it was planned from the start, although police trie d to kill Oswald at the theater in Oak Cliff, just after the assassination, but Os wald jammed his thumb into the gap between the revolver's hammer and cylinder, a stunt he had learned in his CIA training, which is why he had a bandage on his hand when Ruby shot him. That was the reason Oswald ALIENS259"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"screamed \"I'm being made a patsy!\" at the moment of his arrest at the theater. Though Oswald did not shoot Kennedy, he had extensive personal knowledge of the whole operation, as a member of the hit team, extending over several states. The CIA had copied the old KGB procedures used by Ruby and the rest of the hit team, and the film showed that Ruby was very thoroughly tr ained and rehearsed for the hit. It is simply unlikely that a mere 'nightclub owner' w ould have been so familiar with such assassination procedures, or be able to carry them out with such finesse, without such expert training. Jim Garrison also identified Ruby as the CIA 'bagman' in the Dallas area, providing liaison and money to the various Cuban and other CIA-sponsored groups or other catspaws, a likely place for an ex-Mob man, who probably did a lot of skimming. In early 1962 (before my Peace Corps trai ning), I had organized and led a Young Americans for Freedom picket line, protesting \"conventional warfare in Southeast Asia\", outside a United Nations meeting in Midland, Texas, at which the U.N. announced its sponsorship of 'limited wa rfare' and 'counterinsurgency tactics', ostensibly to diminish the risks of all-out war. I viewed it as of an ulterior way for the Illuminati to 'blood our troops', in preparati on for the coming Viet Nam war, to which the 'limited war' was to be escalated. Th is would ultimately maintain the Illuminati munitions manufacturers in the lavish lifes tyles to which they had become accustomed. In early 1963, two men matching Oswald's and Ruby's descriptions were seen taking a shot at the right-wing, closet-gay , General Edwin Walker, from nearby Turtle Creek Drive, in Dallas. This was a psychopolitical 'stage setting' for the future, intended to 'alienate' Walker from the future conspi racy, in which Dallas was the last of five alternative assassination locales, which c ould be actuated during Kennedy's political tour. The first four locations—Miami, New Orleans, Houston, and San Antonio—had been canceled as the tour progressed, leaving Dallas as the final and last chance for the hit, which was planned at least as early as Nov., 1962. Kennedy's intent was to stop the escalati on, and shut off the anticipated Golden Pipeline to the Illuminati, who killed him because he double-crossed them, after making deals with them to get elected. Kennedy' s apparent original complicity in this war-for-profit-and-political-pow er scheme, was revealed by his formation of the Green Berets—as 'der Fuehrer's' personally sworn S.S. elite—and the 'closet Nazi' new uniform designs for the new counterinsurgency teams, which gave birth to the S.W.A.T. (\"Special Weapons And Tactics\" ) teams, almost identical c opies the old Nazi Waffen S.S. and S.A. uniforms. \"J ack-booted thugs\", anyone? Aside from his plan to shut off the pla nned Vietnam War, the thing which most surely contributed to his assassination, was Kennedy's issuance of debt-free currency, around a month before the assassination. This is the actual truth, Kennedy issued constitutional, gold and silver-backed dollars , which was cutting the cojones off the Federal Reserve gang. That currency change was immediately rescinded after the assassination, one of the first orders of business. Astounding but true, it proved that Kennedy was not a Keynsian, Fabian Socialist, but a 'hard-money' man, a constitutionalist, and a Libertarian, Jeffersonian Democrat. J.F.K.'s older brother, Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr., was originally groomed for president from childhood. After his inadvertent death in a bomber accident in WWII, Jack became his replacement. Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. (\"Papa Joe\"), US. ambassador to Great Britain, was in the IUuminati, like the Rock efellers, and was likewise a Nazi collaborator ALIENS260"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"and spy (F.D.R. blocked his prosecution fo r treason and espionage). The Kennedy boys even sat on Hitler's knee, during their vis its to Berchtesgaden, the Fuehrer's Alpine retreat. The boys had been clan destinely raised to be Ameri can IllumiNazi leaders. After all, Bobby and Jack had 'proved' themselv es, by supplying Senator Joe McCarthy the documentary \"dirt\" used in his hysterical H.U.A.C. hearings. Jack Kennedy made promises he apparen tly intended to break, by first hiring 'Fabian Socialists' (Cambridge-trained closet fascists) in his administration, then firing them one by one, as he began to move away from the 'secret' fascist orientation which got him the power. Kennedy showed all the ear marks of heading toward a third, more Libertarian position (as I gleaned from Kennedy's book, Profiles in Courage, which gave a more 'real' profile of Jack Kennedy 's rather undisclosed leanings). Kennedy was apparently purging male fascist types—a ffiliated with the Illuminati and national security establishment—from the governme nt, similar to F.D.R.'s purge of pro-Hitler/Mussolini fascists from the cabinet of his second administration, and Mussolini's purge of International Socialists and Communists from his second administration (Il Duce was originally an International Socialist). Kennedy had made public condemnations of \"clandestine organizations\" less than a week before his death, wh ich many were led by the misi nformationists to mean the John Birch Society, which I discounted, sinc e close Kennedy family friend, Cardinal Cushing, of Boston, as well as Jacqueline Kennedy's cohorts—Oleg Cassini and Cholly Knickerbocker—and her father's family (the Auchinclosses), were sponsors of the Birch Society. The Birchers appeared to be anti-Ke nnedy (which could have been orchestration intended to create cover for his undisclose d agenda), but were not para-military. No...... Kennedy was talking about the CIA, not the Birchers. The CIA misinterpreted Kennedy's statements so the public wouldn't know there was a squabble between Kennedy and themselves, or the Federal Reserve Bank, only a week or so before they planned to kill him and blame it on the \"right wing\" or \"Castro\". Kennedy's purge shouldn't be interprete d as a patent homophobic bigotry, but rather one which frequently involved CIA- connected homosexuals, who were in high ratio among the Templar-Illuminati pederast variety, such as a whole nest of them who were classmates in the '30s and '40s at New Mexico Military Institute (\"NMMI\"), in Roswell, New Mexico. Those 'good Ol' boys' were lavished with lucrative defense contracts during the three or four wars sinc e, or were placed in prestigious government or military positions. Like th e graduates of a particular secret P.O.W. camp—non-coms included—they have all been well taken care of, to the man. Several of them who were directly or indirectly victim s of the Kennedy purge, were naturally implicated in the assassination. Just take a good look at the defense contracts for the Viet Nam War. During WWII, Joe Kennedy, Jr., like many other 'Illuminati sons', was to be kept safe in the special P.O.W. camp in Ba varia, near the Swiss border, in Adam Weishaupt's old stamping grounds. On allied bombing raids, 'certain' bombers made 'protected' landings, and their personnel escorted to the special camp, where they were treated like royalty by the German command. Joe Kennedy's plane was accidentally shot down, or crashed on landing, killing him. Th ese arrangements related to the traitors mentioned in Charles Higham's Trading With the Enemy, who through special connections to Hitler and his financial s upporters, acquired these cushy accomodations for young officers who were in thei r families or spheres of influence.

Without their special connections, these IllumiNazis would have been no more capable of achieving success than anyone else, in a truly capitalist society. Almost all of them had marriages arranged through Illu minati-aristocratic channels. Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy's eminent family connections included direct ancestry from most of the royal families of Europe such as the Hapsburgs, including Lorenzo di Medici, of Firenzi, Italy, the renaissance era inspira tion for Nicola Macchiavelli's The Prince.

THE HISTORICAL EXAMPLES Where people are free to produce and tr ade, there should be no problem. Food production is the ultimate key to freedom, and the freedom of people who produce it are essential to a free and independent society. Even \"rich soil\" can be created by any one, provided they have the freedom to do so. To the contrary, control over food production is one of the primary Trilateralist priorities, ergo a war against farmers and ranchers. The Illuminati is precipitating world-wide death on what should be the eve of world freedom. The \"cattle mutilations\" experiments appear to be a research and development project, in which flying saucer-borne \"death ray\" guns are used to shoot cattle, after which tissue is removed from them to examine for particular damage to the reproductive and immune systems, for the purpose of de veloping \"stealth murder weaponry\", in which human victims may be murdered in such a way that their deaths appear to be from 'natural' causes. \"Population control\" and political assassination come first to mind. This is to make possible perpetual Illuminati world control, based on the original scheme devised by Hassan I Sabbah (founder of the Order of the Devoted in 1093), based on the pantheistic teachings of the Persian, Abdullah (c. 11th century), whose teachings included the Tibetan Bonpas Doctrine Of th e Non-Ego, which had come to Persia through the peripheral gnostic Sufi teachi ngs of the Roshiniya and Thuggee murder cults seeking to overturn Islam and restore goddess worship, and to control the world by assassinating and replacing leaders with their kind.

The tattered remn ants of those Kulacs were beginning to regenerate. The Illuminati could not allow this fertile region to once again supply needed food and profit for a re-vitalized Ukraine, which could capitalize on feeding and strengthening a large part of the world, and threaten Illuminati food control. On the eve of Peristroika, the Chernobyl di saster was arranged by the Illuminati, to poison the blood and soil of the Ukrainians, to deprive the food and spiritual resolve needed for them to break with the Soviet system, to rebuild thei r former strength and health, and most of all, to resume the fo od production of the fertile Ukraine. The Ukraine was dealt yet another devastating bl ow, by the spewing of radioactive poisons out upon the Ukrainians. The Kulacs were originally Germanic peasant farmers imported by the Czars, to farm the Ukraine. Actor Jack Palance, an Ukrainian by birth, described the Chernobyl disast er as \"a desecration\". The Ukraine lost 7 million Kulacs in Sta lin's pogrom, another 7 million in WWII, and several more millions in Stalin's insane \"purges\".

It was proof that the Illuminati had no stake in the Germans as a \"race\", a nd had manipulated them with false \"Aryan\" propaganda via the S.S., which was founded by the Illuminati later that same year, after Morgenthau's Pastoral Policy had failed at Versailles. It is a well-known fact that at the time, president Wilson was so sick that he was of an easily-manipulated puppet of his CFR/IIA 'controllers', and died soon afterward. In 1919, Colonel E. M. House was one of those nutty, megalomaniacal Texans who, like all modern self-proclaimed Zionist messiahs, declared himself the be \"God\". As the adviser to President Wilson, he went to Paris to establish liaison between an American group and its British counterpart, which called itself the Round Table, which had grown out of British diamond and gold magnate Cecil Rhodes' fanatical world government concept, having as its goal th e establishment of world-wide British imperialism. Rhodes was a discip le of elitist aesthete, Prof essor John Ruskin of Oxford (a proponent of the Pythagorean 'Golden Me an' and other Hermetic theories), and a follower of Adam Weishaupt and Illuminism . In his will, Rhodes instructed Lord Rothschild to expand the Round Table, which, like the German S.S., was structurally patterned after the Freemasons and Jesuits. At Paris, a new orga nization arose, which mooted and replaced the League of Nations, called the (Royal) Institute for International Affairs (\"I.I.A.\"). In New York, it was called the Council for Foreign Affairs (\"C.F.R.\"). The two groups merged at Paris, in pursuit of a British-American dominated world government. The group was fi nanced by Rhodes and his friends, the wealthy international bankers. \"Morgenthau' s Pastoral Policy\" was one of the group's earlier plans. When it failed, they financed the S.S. and chose Hitler to lead Germany. By exterminating the Germans, Britain and the U.S. would have moved a step closer to British-American world imperialism. The C.F.R. used both right and left strategy. It financed the Russian revolution, helped set up the S.S. in 1919, financed Hitler's rise to power in th e 1920s (in fact, chose Hitler from among several candidates, in 1923), and promoted international so cialism through the U.N., which it founded through their agents who were guiding U.S. policy in 1945. That was the \"New World Order\" of which Hitler spoke, which was to come about after the 'weak' had been destroyed in the coming war. That 'order' has been in effect since the close of WWII, at least on paper, except its founders have never b een able to fully put it into effect. They cannot figure out how to tell us it is \"the law\", since there are so many little stumbling blocks in our constitution standing in its way, such as the phrase \"...this Constitution...is the Law of the Land\", and \"...these Sovereig n united States\". The C.F.R. is currently engaged in destroying U.S. sovereignt y, and now envisions a New World Order embracing both Communism and 'state-capitali sm' (i.e., fascism). The U.S. and Britain are apparently the leading models for the new wo rld fascist state, whic h will be, like that envisioned by Hitler, composed of \"nationa l-concentrationist\" entities which have no real sovereignty.

As you may know, Theodore Hertzl, also Sephar dim (\"Sun-Hare-People\" , or \"Aryan\") was astounded in 1897, when the Russian discip les of Karl Marx—the Ashkenazim from Moscow—showed up in Basle, Switzerland at his first International Zionist Congress and took over his organization. Both the Sephardim and the Ashkenazim (\"East-Canaan-People\")(also called the Khazars, which means \"Goose-Hares\") came from the same type of Osiris/Sun-Hare/Is is/Sun-Goose-worshipi ng Aryan/Canaanite stock, yet had a different history since about 1,500 B.C., but Morgenthau probably didn't realize it, or care about it for that ma tter. Such \"world power\" types, including Hitler, Rhodes, House, etc., were megalomaniacal-messianic flakes anyway. Like many other \"German Jews\" (Sepha rdim), Hans Morgenthau, Sr., had an almost pathological fear of the \"Ostju den\" (Ashkenazim)—those Uralo-Altaic- speaking-Tartar Khazars, whose kingdom in 600 A.D. stretched from the Black Sea to the Caspian. These Schythian-related people had originally been converted to Talmudic Judaism around 679 A.D., and to a Sephardic li ke Morgenthau (whose families had for centuries lived as the Nobility of Jewry), the Ashkenazim were considered inferior, illegitimate, \"counterfeit Jews\", because their (particular branch of Canaanite) lineage had not descended from the \"Hebrews\" or \"C hildren of Israel\" who purportedly were \"enslaved by the Egyptians\"... \"followed Moses into the Promised Land\", and \"lived under King David or Solomon\" in the United Mona rchy of Israel, nor were they part of the Diaspora from Babylon. To Morgenthau, th ey were no more \"Jewish\" than the Phoenicians, Sumerians, Finns, Turks, Scythians, Ukrain ians, Celts, Scots, Irish and Britons, etc., to whom they were related. After about 1,000 A.D., the Ashkenazim were moved around all over Russia, Poland, the Ukraine, and Lituania, and had, as an oppressed people, emerged as the controlling group in the Communist Revoluti on. Stalin, Trotsky, Lenin, Molotov, Kruschev, Beria, and numerous other Communist leaders were often of the Ashkenazim. This affiliancy to the Communists (Trotsky had recruited and trained his Red Army Cadre in the Bronx in 1916-17, financed by the Jacob Schiff, Kuhn and Loeb and other international banking firms headquartered in New York), and to the Zionists (whom they had taken over), undoubtedly reinforced Morg enthau's fears desi re to appease the Ashkenazim, Zionists, and Communists. In 1917, the international bankers, with the aid of German foreign minister Zimmerman, arranged for Trotsky's cadre to take their famous train ride through Germany, to rend ezvous in St. Petersburg with the returning P.O.W.s from the Russo-Japanese war, who had been indoctrinated (courtesy of the bankers) while still in the Japanese pris on camps, with Bolshevik propaganda, and trained into the Red Army structure specified by Trotsky. Perhaps Morgenthau thought Germany would make a nice new Bolshevik or Zionist homeland for the Ashkenazim in Germany, and keep them out of America, after which they might show their eternal gratitude to Britain and America, and buy lots of goods and make deals as part of the scheme .

Only the Illuminati stood to gain—lik e their Nazi and Communist spawn—as a bunch of Thuggee incompetents, whose only harvest was death and destruction. How they gonna keep 'em down on th e collective farm, once they've seen California or Montana? Ukrainian farmer s can grow food anywhere. They do it from Northern Canada to South Texas, a ttracted to the rich soils of North America—scientifically named for Ukrainian soils—like iron to magnets. Farming in today's Ukraine is pitifully lo w. Despite relatively large incentives offered to young people to take up farming in the Ukraine, th ere are few takers. A lot of the food comes from areas where agricultural people survived, more or less overlooked by Stalin or the Illuminati. Moldavia provides some food, from the rich soils near the Moldau and Diestr Rivers and tributarie s. Women from the Ukraine, Moldavia and Georgia travel over a thousand miles to Moscow in the warmer months, to sell fruits and vegetables on the streets. Many of these women have university degrees. The Illuminati wants to maintain control of the C.I.R. during its transition to \"capitalism\", to make sure that their favor ite brand of mixed-ec onomy, corporate-state fascism predominates. An incr easingly productive Ukraine wo uld encourage a transition to true capitalism. State-capitalism and La issez faire capitalism are immiscible. The present food shortage in the C.I.R.—created by the Illuminati to slow the transition down or make it impossible, while gaining transitory control—is due to the physical and psychological shock of Chernobyl, and th e inability to recreate capitalism while eliminating the controls of the old Communist system. Originally intended to force the Ukrainians and the C.I.R. into starvation, it instead accelerated th e breakup of the Soviet Union. Now the Communist s are back in control. The phony \"fuel crisis\" of 1974 was created to regain control over the American economy which the Illuminati had lost between 1970 and 1974, largely from \"hippy technology\" which had evolved in the pse udo-communes of that period, through a significant outburst of altern ative energy creativity, grea ter independence, and greater economic resiliency, which caught the Illumi nati by surprise, as the Viet Nam War ended. This development was due primarily to an increased appropr iation of materials, techniques, and equipment, by ordi nary citizens and entrepreneurs. The Illuminati-created 'fuel crisis' was tantamount to th e \"leveling laws\" of 19th century England, in which a high tax was levied on window panes, to oppress the nouveau riche who had arisen during the Engl ish industrial revoluti on. Those too poor to afford the new taxes on window panes, had to get rid of them, with a drop in socio-economic rank.

Can you see them giving up without a depression or another war? And who shall fight whom? The Illuminati exploits dormant hatred s, creates divisions upon which wars, economic exploitation and deceit are built, motivates all parties at \"their own levels\", and sets up each new play of the game. They divide the Muslim world against itself, and use \"Christianity\", \"Judaism\", \"oil\", economic interests, ethnicity and nationalism as wedges, to create more homogeneous societies which are more easily steered into bigger international wars and Illuminati control. The Christians-versus-Muslims squabble in post-Communist Yugoslavia requires a closer look at the big picture. Through us, the Illuminati backed ultra-conservative oligarchic Muslim Saudis and Kuwaitis against 'socialist' Muslim Iraqis, in the \"Gulf War\", in order to keep the Golden Pipeline to Wall Street Illuminati ba nks intact, and to keep the Russians out of the international oil markets, because they have vast petroleum reserves.

Bush is a pal with fellow Trilateralist and Republican, Robert O. Anderson, the man who controls the North Slope of Alaska and the HAARP project, though Anderson would now probably disavow any connection to ARCO, which he created. Chap ter I can be thought of as a kind of \"Revolutionary Manifesto of Laissez Faire Ca pitalist Creatology\"—(i.e., a manifesto of a radical and new artistic and scientific religion, based on the \"Science of the Creative Process\"). The Illuminati originated with \"luminism\", or Mithraism, related to the myth of 'Osiris the Beautiful Hare\", an over 6,000-yea r-old religion, devoted to sun-worship. As a solar god, Aestre (Easter, Auser, Oser, etc., the \"East Hare of Light and Goodness\" [Ahuramazda]) is also the origin for \"Aryans\" (\"Hare-ians\"), or worshipers of Osiris. These included Moors, Greeks, Turks, Mongols, Norse, Schythians, Scots, Irish, Celts, Semites, Arabs, and Syrians, etc. Many tribal names derive from the \"hare\" word, often combined with the \"duck\" or \"goose\" word (emblematic of Isis, Osiris' mate), as do many other words in Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, and North and South America. For example, \"Schythian\" means \"Duck-Hares\", a word which is \"Scutari\" in Turkish. The word \"Aryan\" did not originally denote a race, but rather a religion. However, it later came to be misinterpreted as a r ace, by the leaders of neo-Pagan religious movements of the 20th century. THE \"MODERN ILLUMINATI\" AND THE NAZIS In 1776, Adam Weishaupt, a Bavarian Jesuit priest, and professor of Canon Law at Ingolstadt University, \"reinstituted\" the se cret, \"Illuminaten Orden\", infiltrating the Bavarian Masonic Lodges and instilling the Johanite Gospel, requiring a compulsory belief in \"Almighty God\", and excluding Athe ists and Jews, converting the lodges into instruments of mystical and racial control. Though declining in 1790, the Illuminati was still alive, resurging again in 1912, particular ly in 1914 Austria, fabr icating the pre-Nazi \"Thule Society\", a \"neo-Gnosti c\" racist group, teaching that \"Aryan was good, and Semitic was evil\". This was begun by Jose ph Lanz von Liebenfel's Ostara religion. Members were apparently unawa re that they were worshippers of the \"Easter Bunny\", and that they, as Germans, shared a common racial origin to many of the Jews. The program against Masonic acceptance of Athe ists or Jews, eliminated their potential influence. The Illuminati had a secret world government plan, maintained by compartmentalization, implementing mystical and racial national concentrationism. A 'schism' created between Christian (Prussian) Masons and Atheist and Jewish (and later Zionist-Atheist) Masons, was similar to the Lutheran Reformation, in which Martin Luther's anti-Semitic book, entitled \"The Jews in the Catholic Church\", isolated German Christians from the ideologically co mpetitive 'foreign' in fluences of the Roman Catholic Church, by pointing out Jewish financial influence in Roman Catholicism.

This eventua lly gave rise to the Penitentes in Mexico and the North American Southwest, in which secret members became known as \"Pachucos\", named for their earlier official sponsorship by the Duke of Pachucua, and their American origins in the Mexican stat e of Pachucua. Like the Thuggees of Asia, some Pachucos were required to perform ce rtain criminal acts, and openly wore tatoos on their bodies, later concealed in the fold s of their hands, after the F.B.I. outlawed them, declaring them criminal and subversive. As a boy, I knew many of them. According to one of my uncles, a 32nd De gree Mason, and a Ca tholic, of \"Cajun\" origin (who was never excommunicated fo r his Masonic activity), the American Masonic Lodges refused to accept French Masons into American Lodges, after the time of the Marquis de Lafayette (a friend of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, converted to Masonry by Jeff erson), because of the infilt ration of the French Masonic Lodges by the Illuminati. When it went out the door with the expulsion of the Emperor Maximilian, the Napoleonic Austrian puppet government of Mexico left behind the Mexican National Anthem, Under the Double Eagle (Unter den Doppel Adler), an Austrian march (written by Richard Wagner, the German composer) referring to the \"double eagle\", a symbol which can be found before 655 A.D. on a gold and enamel purse cover from the Sutton Hoo Ship Burial (now in the British Museum). The emblem was carried by German and Austrian Christian Knights Te mplars, during their crusades against the Muslims, and is a Masonic symbol often seen on Shriner rings. The symbol had already found its way into the Roman Empire during the days of the emperor Trajan, when Germanic slave-artisans from the north were imported to decorate Roman architecture and monuments. The double eagle became popul ar during the time of the first 'Holy Roman' emperor, Constantine Porphyrogenesi s (\"Born of the Purple\"), the son of a German officer in the Roman Legions from Trier, and a Hungarian mother. When my ancestors, the Fosters and the Richardsons, brought the Mexican Napoleonic-dictator, Ge neralissimo Santa Anna, before General Sam Houston, after his capture at the Battle of San Jacinto, they first tried to hang him, until they saw the double-eagled Masonic ring on his finger. Instead, they sent him back home via Washington, where the Mexicans eventually decapitated him, double eagle ahd all.

John Baptiste Lamy, Jesuit Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Sa nta Fe, refused the Holy Sacraments to Penitentes, unles s they swore an oath disavowing the Penitente/Pachuco secret sect. Lamy excommunicated those who refused, thereby also stealing much of the lands of their \"broth erhood\", El Rancho de Nuestro Senora de La Luz (The Ranch of Our Lady of Light), and several others, the titles to which were granted to their predecessors-in-title, by the \"pre-Napoleonic/Illuminati\" (Alumbrado-influenced) Spanish king, Phillip II, who was also a Hapsburg (from the House of Esterhazy [\"East-Hare\", or \"Osiri s\", whose 'house' was at Busiris, in the Sixth Nome of Lower Egypt]).

Some have even said that J. Edgar Hoover was a Jesuit priest. Figuring into all this was the \"Holy Grail\" and the \"Golden Cup Ceremony\". Its earliest known pre-Christian origin seems to be from Indo-Sumerian traditions, which related to the Uralo-Altaic-speaking tribes in Western Siberia, from which the Schythians (Scot-Irish), Turks, Koreans, Ja panese, Finns, Celts, Sumerians, Hittites, Minoans, Britons, Saxons, and many other tr ibes descended. Incorrectly thought by some to be Buddhist, it was actually prac ticed by the more an cient, pre-Buddhist, Bonpas religion, of Tibet, which worshipp ed \"black magic\" and \"Kali Ma\" [\"Bloody Mother\", the \"Goddess of Chaos\"], with obvious affiliation to the Thuggee cult, the Society of Assassins, and the Death's Head S.S. Black Order [\"Schwartze Korps\"]). The Bonpas, Thuggees and Assassins believed in a \"collective consciousness\", and that, as the population of the world incr eased, this collective consciousness was \"weakened\" by being shared by too many pe ople. In service to \"Bloody Mother\" (\"Kali Ma\" or Kali Matrakis), they believed in ki lling as many people as possible—preferably everyone—so as to strengthen the \"collective consciousness\". Unlike the S.S., Bonpas, Assassins and Thuggees wore white robes with red sashes. (In one photo however, Hermann Goering can be seen wearing a wh ite SS uniform with a white belt having a thin red line on it.) In 747 A.D., Padmasambava brought Buddhism to Tibet. He supposedly killed or drove all the Bonpas out, but they just we nt \"underground\"—figuratively and literally. Padmasambava \"ceremonially\" incorporated th e main idea of the Bonpas—the Doctrine of the Non-Ego—into Buddhism. The original ceremony of the Bonpas, entailed actual cannibalism, in which the hearts of sacrificial vi ctims were eaten, and their blood drank in the Dance of the Red Tiger Devils} 0 The Buddhists however reject actual cannibalism. The \"Holy Grail\" or \"Golden Cup\" myth survived in Germany through the Nibelungenlied (the bloody pa n-Germanic epic, in which At tila the Hun is believed to be the wise old uncle). Descended from Tibe tan and Uralo-Altaic/Sumerian origins, the Golden Cup myth eventually became as sociated with the libation cup of the Celto-Nordic peoples. As explained in Plat o's Timaeus, the ten Gods of Atlantis commenced their gatherings by collecting th e blood of a young bull in the golden cup. This is evidenced by the two beautiful, La te Minoan, golden Vaphio Cups, found in the Peloponnese, upon which are depicted sever al ancient Minoan \"cowboys\" lassoing young bulls. The Golden Cup, or Holy Grail, ev entually became the double symbol of \"knowledge\", and of \"pure blood\", in the di seased minds of Nazi theorists.

Justinian married a danc er, Theodora, whom he met at the Circo Massimo in Rome. Over 1300 years later, H itler also married a dancer, Eva Braun. Justinian reinstituted \"proskynesis\" (the Roma n salute, \"Hail, Caesar!\").

Hitler and the Thule society eclectically copied the fanaticism of early Christianity, and several secret societies, combined with the aggressive expansionism and organization of the Roman state. The Ahnenerbe Society (\"Society for the Study of Ancestral Heritages\", i.e., Indo-Germanic racial research), was supposed ly racio-theological in nature. In Jan., 1939, Ahnenerbe was incorporated into the S. S., and already had fifty branches, led by Prof. Wust, teacher of Sanskrit at Munich Un iversity. Meetings of the general staff of the S.S. began with Yoga and a Bonpas/B huddist \"Sesshin\". The Ahnenerbe, which maintained constant contact with Tibetan Bonpas lamas, al so contained the mystical Black Order (\"Schwartze Korps\"), the S.S. \"inner circle\". Ahnenerbe's general manager, S.S. Colonel Wolfram Sievers, was hung by the Tribunal at Nuremberg. Ironically, a majority of the ancient \"Sea People\" tribes from whom many of the Israelites under Solomon's short-lived 10t h century, B.C. democracy derived, were originally \"Aryans\", both in terms of race, and in terms of the worship of Osiris. This is confirmed by the word \"Israel\", meaning \"E ast-Sungod-Hare\" (\"Is-\" = \"east\"; \"-ra-\" = \"sun-god\"; \"El\" = the Babylonian Saturn [\" Sa-\" = \"sun\"; \"-turn\" = \"hare\"]), related also to the Ural (\"Hare-El\") mountains, and Mt.

The upshot of this tangled, mystical baggage, collected by various confused segments of the human race, is that \"racio-religions\" are one of the many excuses that \"races\" or \"tribes\" ha ve used for exterminating one another, or even themselves, hi the Illuminati, we meet ourselves coming back, because both Hitler, the Austrian, and Einstein, the Jew, were members of it. The Trilateral Commission (The \"Three-Sided Commission\", in reference to the triangle) IS the Illuminati. The triangle with the \"all-seeing eye of God\", is the triangular top of the pyramid with the eye, as seen on the dollar bill. It was used in the 1937 Los Alamos \"p2\" project, by von Braun. It is also a Masonic and Rosicrucian symbol. Originally, it was the eye of Ra-Bel or Ba'a l (Ba' + El), the Sun God, and of Osiris, symbolized by the \"Apis Bull at Memphis\", w ith the sun disk on its head, which is the \"golden calf mentioned in the Old Testament. Since the 'Osirian' Ba'alamites were still the religious leaders of so many of the Isra elites, the Rabbis created a 'new' religion, in which the \"old gods\" were disavowed (or rather recreated in disguised new forms). More specifically, the \"mode rn Illuminati\" is a secr et group of world power mongers, whose title suggests that they are \"i lluminated\" (i.e., possessed of some special or great \"mystical secrets\" or \"wisdom of the ages\", which we normal individuals do not possess). This is a bunch of crap, because David Rockefeller and his clique have no greater knowledge than you or I, except fo r the criminal knowledge that any gang of \"Thuggees\" have. The Illuminati have knowle dge concerning the te chnological secrets which they have stolen and secreted away from the world, to maintain their dictatorship ALIENS271"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"by secret economic control, and to protect their secret resources from the threat of advanced technology which could free the people of the world from their control. This is not \"higher\" knowledge, but \"lower knowledge\". Osiris (\"The Beautiful Hare\"), as a sun god, originally represented sunlight, and later \"knowledge\". This was reflected in Greece and Rome by Helios or Prometheus (\"Pro-Mithraist\") the \"...bringer of light and knowledge...\". To fundamentalist Christians, this was evil, because it was the same as Adam's eating of the apple, and \"...partaking of the tree of knowledge...\", which \"...took aw ay man's innocence...\"(i.e., ignorance). The fact that an evil group calls itself \"The Illuminated Ones\", claiming \"higher knowledge\", does not make real knowle dge evil, but good. That is what this book is all about. What is truly evil, is stealing and hiding technological knowledge created by individuals for the good of themselves and a civilized human race. The evil \"Set\" (brother of Osiris) was obvi ously related to the origin and namesake for the Judeo-Christian \"Satan\" (\"Sa-\" = \"sun\"; \"-tan\" = \"dawn\"), which was synonymous to the Minoan Minotaur (\"Min-\" = \"A-min\" [\"East-Min\", or \"Amon\", the Memphis fertility goat-god], combined with \"-taur\" [\"bull/hare\"], to form a fertility goat-god/Apis Bull/Hare/sun-god which roam ed about the Labyrinth, tormenting the damned sent there, beneath the isle of Thera (\"She-hare\", the Minoan name for \"Ashera\", a form of Astoreth, the female flying [Canaanite] form of Osiris). This was the derivation for the Christian \"Purgatory\". The \"immaculate conception\" of Christ, is similar to the ancient myth in which Isis (sister and wife of Osiris) \"immaculately\" conceived of Osiris, and gave birth to Horu s, while Osiris was entrapped by Set in a knot in the trunk of a Tamarisk tree which was used as a roof support for the house of the King of Byblos. This ancient story orig inated in Western Siberia with the Uralo- Altaics, as a mating of the Sun-Hare, Osir is (\"Heru-\") and the Sun-Duck, Isis (\"- Khuti\"), giving birth to the Sun-Hawk, Horus (\"Heru-Khuti\", or \"Hare-Duck\"!). George Bush and the rest of th e Trilateralists would clearly like to force all of us to believe in their \"god\", whoever or whatever that is, and we are just no damned good unless we do. Again, the upshot of all this is that we're swimming in mythological garbage here, and we simply cannot allow our selves or anyone else to predicate our political decisions on their personal, mystical, subjective religious concepts, and should settle only for government by reason, rather than a dictatorship based on \"faith\" in someone's personal or mass religious mythology. The kind of thinking behind the Ahnenerbe/Na zi madness, could just as well have supported a movement by neo-Pagan \"Aryans\" (i.e., German Safartic {i.e., \"Aryan\"} Jews) to use a holocaust of th eir own making, based upon similar religious horse shit, as a pretext to \"purify their race\", by exterm inating what they might have decided were \"non-Semitic\" Aryans, such as Gypsies, Kh azars, Germans, or other Asiatic peoples who had converted to Judaism, rather than to have been born into it, via some of the \"tribes\" delineated by the post-Solomonic Rabbis, after th e 10th century B.C. creation of the ancient kingdom of Israel. By such th inking, they could have exterminated the Christians, as \"non-Semitic, heretical Jews \". The prejudice of German Jews toward Asiatic Jews is well-known in some quarter s, as reported by Meyer Levin (author of Compulsion, a true story about some murderers on a cross-c ountry killing spree), during his promotion of The Diary of Anne Frank, when German Jews tried to take away the manuscript because Levin happened to be of Asiatic origin, and not pro-Communist.

If known to the gene ral public, this technology would break the coercive monopoly, and reduce things to the normal realm of capitalist competition and survival of the fittest. For this reason, this book is the greatest threat to Illuminati power ever seen, because it discloses the technological secrets and true origin of the flying saucer, as their best kept secret, and makes the construction of a flying saucer a possibility for anyone having competent technological skills, and wishing to build their own. EINSTEIN WAS A NEW-AGER The work of Albert Einstein is useful to the Trilateral Commission, not only for its fuzzy thinking, but also because of its support for the Big Bang, and other Big Lies of Big Science. Einstein was undoubtedly a grea t mathematician, but metaphysically and epistemologically, he was an idiot. Einstein was philosophically an existentialist, religiously a Cabballist, and epistemologically a Platonist. It is odd that the \"Father of Existentialism\", Edmund Husserl, had two main student s, Jean-Paul Sartre, a Zionist , and Martin Heidegger, a Nazi. Einstein was a follower of the former, and Hitler was deified by the latter. Einstein's theories were influenced by the Ka balah as well as existentialism, which relies upon a Platonist epistemology —one based upon Plato's Cave Analogy, which holds that our knowledge of reality is like that of an observer in a cave, outside of which a caravan passes between a fire, also outside the cave, and a wall inside the cave, casting a shadow of the caravan on the wall; according to th e analogy, we cannot know reality, but see only a \"shadow\" of it. In keeping with this cave analogy, Einstein continually referred to what he called an \"apparent effect\", as if his eyes and senses were unreliable tools of cognition, or means for acquisiti on of any valid facts about reality. Einstein applied his peculiar existentialist and Platonist epistemological and metaphysical misconceptions to physics, thus protracting many cognitive mistakes into this supposedly \"exact science\" . His fundamental errors incl uded his fictitious concept of time, caused by his Platonist epistemology. The existence of what he referred to as a space-time continuum concept, was a begged question. He said that space is curved, attempting to attribute a geometric configura tion or \"grain\" to unarticulated space. He was so subjective, that he thought what he called an \"apparent effe ct\" (his subjective manifestation of Plato's cave analogy), a ffected the whole universe, in a giant contradiction, based on the Platonist concep t that man could not know reality or the nature of it, but only an \"apparent effect\" or \"shadow\" of it, whic h existentially had no relation to what anyone else knew or perceived. So why did he even bother to say it? In reality, \"Time\" is a fiction created by man, to measure the rate at which events occur in the universe, and to interrelate them to each other within the spatial context on and around our earth, as it moves through sp ace, and to measure cyclical movements having distinct relationships to all other even ts, particularly the movement of our planet in the solar system. A specific \"time\" is marked by a fictionalized, 'frozen moment' or position in space, in respect to a particular cyclical measurement of the clock and the ALIENS273"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"calendar—two mathematical computers used to measure \"time\". Our earth moves around the sun, while our solar system move s around our galaxy, which in turn moves around the edge of the Milky Way, which in turn moves around the outer reaches of the Magellanic Clouds. Our earth and everything on it, and everything else in the universe, can never be in the exact same place ever again. Any rational person should be able to see why \"time travel\" is a physical and metaphysical impossibility. But, if you can be tricked by the Illuminati into believing it is possible, then you can be tricked into believing any other Big Lie they arbitrarily choose to tell you. In reality, we can know that , by the nature of reality, all events always occur in the instant present, and are irretrievably locked into their contexts in respect to all other events occurring at that same instant, thro ughout the universe, whet her we are aware of them or not. References to \"the future\" or \"the past\" are purely fictitious, though we may reconstruct events as they occurred in the past intellectually. Single events cannot be displaced out of their cont exts, without reference to thei r relationship to the rest of the universe at the time they occurred. 'Time travel' is also an epistemological impossibility, because a jump forward or b ackward in the fiction of \"time\", would require a physical jump of the whole univers e from one configuration in one place, to another configuration, at a far distant place, instantly. This is too much to ask of the universe, just to satisfy the subjective, psychological whims of an Einstein. Only the present exists, forever, and reality is ever ything occurring or existing in that same, instant present, everywhere. We can know the nature of reality, without having to know all of its events and minute features. Of the two epistemologies, the Illuminati propagate the Platonist one (and Einstein's theory of subjective 'time travel' and the 'forth dimension', etc.), because it supports the complete upheaval of a rationa l, Aristotelian epistemology based on the primacy of the senses as valid tools of c ognition, and supports the mystical Platonist epistemology based on faith, which allows the public to be misled by, and to accept the Big Lie. The Big Bang cosmography is only a cosmological extension of this Big Lie. The laws of physics are determined only by a true philosophically sound reasoning process. Einstein's fundamentally subjec tive and unsound reasoning errors were responsible for the wrongness of his theories , which could not be corrected by all his mathematical mumbo-jumbo. His peculiar metaphysical aberrations were manifested in his well-known formula, purporting to show the interconvertibility of \"energy\" and \"mass\", as follows: \"E = MC 2 \" (\"Energy [the ability to do work] equals mass times the velocity of light, squared\"). The formula 'equi vocated' an abstract concept (the \"ability to do work\") with the manifestation of a physical concretion (\"mass\") multiplied times the velocity of light, squared. This was sort of like saying something like \"work equals a rock times the velocity of light, squared.\" The formula doesn't say how much work can be done, or anything else, for that matter. \"Energy\" E, is the \"ability to do work\", while the \"velocity of light\" (\"C\"), is the velocity at which electromagnetic radiation is said to be transmitted from one point in space to another. To equivocate the abstract concept of \"energy\", with mass times the square of the velocity of light, can be consid ered as of an attempt to explain how much work a particular mass might accomplish, measured by the quanta of radiation it might hypothetically be converted into, as a \"non-ine rtial\" form of dynamic energy stored in electromagnetic radiation in space, as well as a measure of how much potential electromagnetic energy is stored in a partic ular quantum of mass, but it just isn't true. ALIENS274"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"Einstein's contradictory theory presupposes that mass is not \"energy\", since, only during some non-spontaneous process of intercon version of mass into radiant energy, or radiant energy into mass, coul d \"work be done\". Mass appe ars impertinent, and \"C = E/R\" (Tesla's equation, which excludes mass) appears true, saying that, at C, Energy E, is divided by resonant frequenc y R. 'Massless' radiant energy, or \"cosmic radiation\", is dynamic energy stored in transit in space, by the vibrations of the ether. I define space as a volume, which is never empty, but contains an ether, and omnidirectionally interpenetrating radiant energy, of many freque ncies. The energy level of radiant energy is determined by its frequency. This radiant energy is the ZPR. An interesting aspect of Tesla's equation, is that while the resonant frequency, R, divides the quanta of energy, E, at the ve locity of light, C, the reactance of the electromagnetic radiation vari es as the fourth power of the frequency; the higher the frequency, the higher the reactance. This means that \"p2\" is more effective at higher frequencies, since the time lag between changes in charge and current distribution in the dipole, is enhanced by the limitations of C. This permits the dipole to continue to \"shake out\" charges on the peak negative pole, both during and between negative peaks. At 3/8th wavelength tuning, the positive and negative wave components cross and neutralize one another at the neutral pole, between the negative peaks at the opposite pole. The principle that the negative pole will continuously shoot out negative charges is also effective at 1/4 wavelength tuning, with the exception that the opposite pole will be peak positive rather than neutral. Unlike Einstein, Tesla believed that the velocity of particles were not limited by C, and even advanced examples in which he assert ed that particles had exceeded C, because the speed at which they were propelled by light depends on the voltage and frequency of the radiation. Mass or radiation in themse lves do not represent \"energy\", since \"work\" requires the application of force to mass, whic h is ignored in the Einstein equation, but was automatically assumed by Tesla, who knew that space is full of potential energy. The odd paradox under Einstein's theory is that radiat ion traveling through space would do no \"work\", and therefore could not be \"energy\". The only way light could be energy, would be if, as Einstein said, \"it ge ts tired\", in which case some of the force originally emitted at its source , is transferred to, and does work on, some of the 'space' (the ether) through which it is transmitted, but this case contra dictorily requires the existence of something Einstein denied, th e ether. His statement concerning \"light fatigue\" was inconsistent to his equation say ing that 'space' has no mass, and thereby agreed with Tesla's equation, which was not plagued by this inconsistency, since it concerns only dynamic force in radiant form, as an \"ability to do work\". Another major difference between Tesla and Einstein, was that Tesla conceived the so-called \"atomic energy\" possessed by an atom, as radiant force being transmitted into an \"atomic reaction\" by the cosmos. It may be for this reason that the \"Tokamak\" and other \"fusion\" reactors, using a \"magnetic bot tle\" to contain their reactions, produce no net work. The extremely strong magnetic fields must create impenetrable barriers blocking reactions between the \"atomic fuel\", and the \"outer cosmos\" (i.e., occluding the ZPR). Like obsolete nuclear fission reactors, \"fusion\" reactors are in tentionally designed as dangerous, behemoth structures, to be operated only by a corporate/state socialist (\"competition-prohibited\"), Trilateralist power company, providing little competitive threat to conventional hydrocarbon-fueled generators. ALIENS275"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"Einstein's equation excluded resonance, as the time-relative distribution of force in light per distance. The radiant energy stored in space is relative to voltage, which in turn relates to the frequency of the radiation, a nd the time it takes for it to be transmitted from its point of emission to its point of \"reconversion\" into inertia, momentum, or heat, or its expenditure on the ether, as it in turn is converted into mass. Mass has inertial characteristics which are not re flected, because the laws of inertia are said not to apply to electromagnetic radiation, which is 10 40 times stronger than the gravitational interaction. This implies that energy, like time, may not exist, but is only a convenient fiction, since inert, static mass does no work, and neither does radiatio n while in tran sit in space. The equations of Tesla and Einstein are in direct conflict, because Tesla's equation is consistent with the universe as a dyna mic, ever-changing, eternal, infinite perpetual-motion system, while Einstein's e quation describes the universe as a finite, temporary, Big Bang-type event, expanding from an ultimate, fictitious, 'original explosion', which is continually winding dow n. Of the two equations/metaphysics, the Illuminati naturally prefer the latter, since it supports their sales at the gas pump, and the suppression of flying saucer tech nology via their Big Lie Program. Energy can only be expressed in reality , during \"changes in form\". Of the two equations, only Tesla's equation can be correct, since it is the only one taking resonance into account, which is the rate per second at which electromagnetic oscillations or \"beats\" occur. Without oscillations, nothing is converted in form. The frequency of electromagnetic radiation is the \"beats per se cond\", and the level of \"force\" or \"voltage\" at which work is done. The more beats per second, the greater the work. Before 1902, Tesla already had numerous patents for the use of \"radiant energy\", both from \"synthetic sources\" and from \"the natural media\" of the universe. The Nazis and the Trilateralists stole Tesla's flying saucer invention, and the U.S. government helped them take it to Germany, and now conceal it from us. Nikola Tesla was an Atheist/humanist, who detested mys ticism, Einstein, Communism, and the Nazis. Einstein's beliefs were consistent with th e Nazis, Communists, Trilateralists, and the U.S. government. A naive Tesla tried to warn the U.S. government about German militarism before WW I, and was naturally ignored, because the Illuminati already had a big new war planned, and intended to ma ke billions selling munitions. Meanwhile, Communism—an experiment in world slavery created by the Illuminati, as a mystical religion based on the worship of the \"collec tive consciousness\", acce pted on faith rather than reason—came into existence, failed, and has finally collapsed, after murdering off literally hundreds of millions of people, in service to \"Kali Ma\". This shows how heinous, criminal conduct often originates with the Illuminati's appeal to \"faith, rather than reason\", as a means of mind contro l, inevitably follow ed by mass murder. I have a dream that some day the United States will truly separate the \"state\" from \"religion\" and mysticism, whet her that of the Illuminati, Christians, Masons, Buddhists, Bonpas, Moslems, Jews , Communists, New Ager s, \"Scientologists\", \"Environmentalists\", or \"Synergists\". In 1979, I went to the National Security Resources Study Center (now The J. Robert Oppenheimer Research Center), at Los Alamos, which was opened to the public in Oct., 1977 by President Jimmy Carter (whom I had met in Savannah, in October, 1974, during his campaign for governor of Georgia) . I sought basic information on hydrogen, and could not find it, but what I did fi nd was astounding. Though simple data on ALIENS276"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"hydrogen was 'unavailable', I discovered the plans for the hydrogen bomb! I also discovered the inadvertent \"glossed\" refere nces to Lorentz' purported measurements concerning the excess positive charge of the hydrogen nuclear proton, and his postulate concerning the electrical cancellation of gravity. When I requested a \"bibliography on Tesla\" from the librarian, she said \"...all information on Tesla is classified\". On my return to Santa Fe that evening, at a restaurant, I angrily proclaimed my disgust with the research facility, to a st udent from Harvard sitting next to me, for refusing my request for Tesla information, while making the plans for the hydrogen bomb available to me. The Harvard student went to Los Alamos, photo-copied the hydrogen bomb plans, and published a pamphlet on them at Harvard, creating a sizeable controversy. The center was almost since closed down. Edward Teller, \"Father of the H-Bomb\", declared in 1979 that all secret information possessed by the government bel onged to us, because we had paid for it, and that it should be made available to us from one year of the government's 'acquisition' of it. The H-bomb plans were probably intentionally planted by the Illuminati, to punish and scapegoat Teller , and to 'justify' increased \"security measures\", for the ulterior purpose of c ontinued government suppression of other, beneficial energy secrets, having no thing to do with war or \"terrorism\". Nikola Tesla originally intended to give his flying saucer invention to the Geneva Convention, for use in the prevention of war. He was disillusioned when the League of Nations fell apart, and began to conceal his di scoveries. Tesla died a pauper in 1943, and the government illegally confiscated all his known papers. Today those scientific papers (over 80 large trunks, around a box car load), ar e stored in secret va ults at Los Alamos, still classified, over 56 years later. The main reason for the continued secrecy is the flying saucer, as well as things which we can only imagine. In the end, the Illuminati perpetuate their power through mysticism, exploiting the interplay between Judais m, as the precursor to Christianity, and Christianity, as an heretical offshoot of Judaism. Naziism, an Illuminati \"synthes is\"—a slop-pot of the concepts of the Bonpas, Templars, Gnosti cs, Christians, Jews, and Mithraists—could never last, but accelerated the work of sc ientists working for the governments of the world, and produced a lot of discoveries in a very short time, for th e Illuminati to steal and hide, or use to keep us in control.

Around 1980, I stumbled not to my surprise, upon more suppressed energy secrets 11 . Most of this type of information h itherto publicly available, 'disappeared' from public access after 1942, due to the 'nat ional scouring' operation by the F.B.I, which I mentioned before, which was not as co mplete as they would have liked. In fact, they missed some important material, due to th eir ignorance, being guided chiefly by the Relativist Quantum Mechanics, who failed to understand Tesla's technology. For example, on Tesla's death on Jan. 8 (not th e 7th as most documents say), 1943, the FBI got involved in investigating as to whether or not anything of a national security interest was involved in Tesla's effects. In the opinion of John G. Trump 12 , head of the government's Office of Scient ific Research and Development, Technical Aids, Div. 14, NTRC (predecessor agency to the CIA's O ffice of Scientific Intelligence), \"nothing of any value was contained\", and there was \"no reason to retain\" custody of Tesla's effects. (Trump was also a professor at M.I.T., and had his feelings hurt by Tesla's 1938 review and critique of M.I.T.'s huge Van de Graaff generator~with its two thirty-foot towers and two 15-foot diameter balls , mounted on railroad tracks—which Tesla showed could be out-performed in both voltage and current by one of his tiny coils about two feet tall.) Altogether, in Tesla's effects, there were the contents of his safe, two truckloads of papers and apparati from his hotel, an other 75 packing crates and trunks in a storage facility, and another 80 large stor age trunks in another storage facility.

Bliss, Texas, at which time Wright- Patterson's Air Force Research and Development Command people took a closer look. They had all previously completely missed the boat in their attempts to interpret Tesla's technology—according to the false Relativist physics—mainly because of the snotty report by their \"expert\", John G. Trump. Even the FBI has failed to grasp the significance of the note concerning Ms. Ma rguerite Merrington's witnessing of Tesla's 1894 \"metallic plate suspension\", and to black it out, in the Tesla papers released under the F.O.I.A. It wasn't until von Braun and co mpany disclosed that their flying saucer technology was based on Tesla's 1890s discoveries, that our government knew what they had, and what the Nazis had already acquired in the 1930's from Tesla's files. Quite a lot of Tesla's technology had already leak ed through several sources before the FBI's scanty look into it in 1943, fully seven years after von Braun's \"p2\" project at Los Alamos. Practically the only thing they were looki ng for was technology related to the atom bomb, and since Tesla had stated that so-called \"atomic energy\" didn't come from the radioactive elements themselves, but from \"c osmic radiation\", they decided he was crazy and neglected his documents until the war wa s over. This concealm ent by neglect was the apparent result of Nazi/corporate-state influence in the government and F.B.I. The data I found around 1980, which showed that all the elements below atomic No. 19, actually transmute in ultraviolet light—some in ordinary daylight—conflicted with Relativistic Quantum Mechanics. The products of these light-element transmutations, brought about with low en ergy bombardment, are alpha particles (stripped helium nuclei, each carrying a +2 ch arge), and beta particles (electrons, each carrying a -1 charge). On purchasing at Los Alamos salvage, two withdrawn volumes on the physics of X-rays 13 . These books showed the existen ce of the transmutation process. I realized that this information and all its reasonably construed implications, had been known by some scientists in both the U.S. and Soviet governments for years. These concealments apparently ha d nothing to do with \"national security\", and the two \"governments\" were apparently in conspir acy to protract archaic technology. Some governments, huh? Due to prior public access to these s ecrets, and the possibility that some 'uninitiated' persons might still know ab out them, the liar gov ernment scientists attempted to confuse these processes, by desc ribing them as the \"photo-electric effect\". That was simply another Big Lie, since the photo-electric effect in volves the ultraviolet ejectment of electrons by suitable emitters, many of which are above atomic number 19, and does not involve the actual transmutati on of the elements, or emission of alpha particles (helium). There are several othe r effects which distinguish this from the photo-elecrtric effect, such as mass which is unaccounted fo r by the lower total weight of the helium atom, from what it should be, according to the sum of the weight of its component parts, representing equivalent ener gy or particles liberated, rearranged or transmuted in the process, similar to the \"f usion reaction\" of the sun.

It is my theory that ZPR and aether-borne energy contained in the space encompassed by the electron prio r to its capture, results in the emissions observed, which are \"squeezed out\" when th e electron is captured by the nucleus. In this process, neutrinos are emitted as the element goes up the atomic scale, and are sucked back into the atom as it returns to its former element, over and over, if the process is continued, in a so rt of \"continuous nuclear orga sm\". Here, we have another \"table-top\"-type fusion reaction, which has been concealed, primarily by treating it as an insignificant 'anomaly', which is th en avoided and summarily dismissed. A similar process occurs in nuclear exci tation of a light element, in which an electron orbit is distorted by a magnetic field, or is excite d a by a U.V. incident particle beam, and repeatedly becomes excentric, so as to \"gather\" energy in the \"L\" orbit, then emit it in the form of ionizing radiation, as the electron \"falls\" back into the \"K\" orbit.

Any two of the axes may be used to produce the third, as follows: A magnetic field will separate positive and negative charges, by turning negative charges in one direction, as positive charges are diverted or emitted in another direction (negative charges may be easily turned, while the positive charges are very difficult to turn).

These particles may be steadily recycled in an oscillatory fluorescent process which may be continued ad infinitum, so long as the load placed on the external circuit is not dropped too rapidly. The trick is to transmute an element into a temporarily radioact ive isotope of very short half-life, after which it quickly return s to its ground state, with the emission of photon energy extracted during its synthetica lly radioactive reaction with the ZPR: Using a one-mole sample of lithium 6—or lithium niobate crystals, manufactured by Union Carbide—this process will produ ce a continuous external current of 50 kw, indefinitely, unless the load is dropped too quickly, in which case a small explosion can occur. This can be 'fail-safed' by use of a computerized control of the incident particle beam in respect to the load, in conjuncti on with an appropriate device such as an ultraviolet laser. More simply, an incident pa rticle beam device can be easily fabricated using the Tesla bulb shown, which may be controlled with an FET (field effect transistor), which senses a change in the field strength and instantly diminishes the current to the bulb. Lithium is the most active of all elements, and is perhaps the most unstable of the \"light elements\". In some cases, transmutation can occur in an incident particle beam of less than 7 volts according to the Blokhin book (in the biblography, and many other ALIENS281"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"similar X-ray references), which gives spec ific product emissions for most elements (unless \"classified\") in respect to the frequenc y of an incident particle beam used at specific voltages. Powerful i onizing radiation can be used to charge field plates, or to produce 'pure electrical energy \". The energy produced, is vastly greater than the electrical energy required to initiate th e reaction, because it comes from the ZPR (\"starlight\"), and need involve no radioactive fuels or wastes. These processes were explored by Tesla pr ior to 1900, and by T. Henry Moray, of Utah 14 , while in Sweden in 1912. Tesla used aluminum and some Group I elements, while Moray used spudomene or lepidol ite—lithium-aluminosilicate rocks—which he called his \"Swedish stone\", to which he soldered triple-distilled germanium, producing semiconductor devices (which he called \"valves\" ) almost twenty years before Shockley, who got the credit. These rocks are almost everywhere in Northern New Mexico, especially found in pegmatite dikes. Sheepherders in the vicinity of Dixon (where the government mined lithium for the H-bomb), ca rried pieces of lithium ore in their pockets in winter, to warm their hands. The moist hands provided the electrolyte contact, and penetrating cosmic radiation (the ZPR) did the rest. The lithium-aluminosilicate elements are all below atomic number 19, a nd in compound form are supposed to work better than the separate, pure elements. The normal number for lithium is \"lithium 7\", while the rarer (and more unstable) isotope is \"lithium 6\", as used in the Union Carbide lithium niobate crystals. Lithium 6 has a low neutron ratio. One Los Alamos scientist I discussed this with said this process was an example of \"chemical energy\", or the \"photo-electric ef fect\", but that was untrue. It could be perhaps called \"nuclear chemical energy\", I suppose. It is a reversible process, the explanatory formula for which has been systematically omitted from nuclear engineering texts, under national security laws, as shown by the following statement: Sec. 1.19: \"...There are two other ways in which a nuclide with a ratio of neutrons that is too low for stability can become more stable. One is by the emission of an alpha particle (sec. 1.12), and the other is by the nucleus capturing a negative electron from outside the atom, thus reversing the process described in sec. 1.16. In each case the change is associated with an increase in the neutron-to-proton ratio. Since neither of theses modes of radioactive deca y is important in connection with nuclear reactors, it is unnecessary to consider them in further detail.\" 15 And so, two separate possible \"other\" ways to produce atomic energy—both using non-radioactive light elements—are con cealed. The primary justification for the concealment of these two processes is rati onalized (for over forty years, since 1952 or earlier) because they are possibly being used to generate electrical energy on flying saucers and other secret proj ects. Although the processes are allegedly unimportant \"...in connection with (archaic) nuclear reactors\" of the kind desired by the Secret Government, 14 T.

These two (reversible) processes, combined in the continuous, oscillatory reaction, appear to be the same as that responsible for the helium power system already mentioned in respect to the helium-powered \"...twelve B.M.W. engines...\" purportedly used on WW II German flying saucers, and in respect to the Papp engine shown in the Appendix. Can you imagine carrying one of these litt le generators around in your hand, from your house to your car, airplane (flying saucer ), boat, or on camping trips, etc., to provide whatever, non-polluting electrical energy you wished, more than you could probably use? It comes clearly into focus at this point, that the culprit vested interests are in the petroleum industry, or rather in the Wall Street monopolists who took over almost all independent petroleum production in the 1950s. I say this even though I could stand to inherit many thousands of acres of proven ga s and oil mineral rights in southeast Texas. Since the Trilateral Commission or Masonic crooks within my own family will probably rip off those mineral rights somehow, before I inherit them, and obliterate all evidence, I probably won't get them anyway, so why should I care? What is more important, is replacing this archaic technology with \"free energy\" generators. TESLA'S 'SPECIAL' GENERATOR: HOW DOES IT WORK? Nikola Tesla discovered a simple, 'special' generator—the complete secret of which is locked away in the Los Alamos vault—which was constructed of \"...copper, aluminum, and iron\", arranged in \"...a peculiar way\" , and had weak magnets or only unmagnetized iron cases. There is no document available, showing specifically how it worked, and only Tesla's cryptic comments on its construction, with claims of fantastic output. The closest things I know of are Tesla's homeopolar generators. Judging from them, and his invention of the standard electric meter used by the power companies on our homes, together with some actual experimentation and tests, I have extrapolated the fundamentals of Tesla's invention, since the electric mete rs are constructed in a 'peculiar' way, are composed of the three metals, and have weak magnets which can be reversed and 'oscillated'. In 1979,1 took two old 115-volt Tesla electric meters—which are at least 70 years old—and connected them together in a 'pecul iar way', attempting at first to measure two separate 115-volt currents coming into an apartment. There are four unlabelled posts on each these old meters, so I didn't know how to connect them, so I just took a shot in the dark. Due to the manner in which I connec ted them—which apparently was wrong—the two meters behaved strangely. At a low current drain, the disks rotated faster than when the current was greater. At a sufficiently high current, the disks stopped, hummed loudly—which I refer to as \"snoring\"—and even reversed, at a still greater energy consumption in the apartment. As the current usage went up and down, there were commensurate changes in the \"snoring\" and disk directions in the two meters. By actually using more electricity in the apartment, less usage was recorded by the meters, as well as the main meter for my entire complex, and the electric bill for my whole complex dropped by about one-third. The mete rs were generating power, perhaps enough to power the entire apartment. Sometimes, wh en the disks were running in reverse, the ALIENS283"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"meters were generating more power than that being used, and when they were running slowly in the opposite direction, the meters we re generating less, but overall, the one-third drop in the bill indicated they were running that apartment, one-third of my complex. Mr. Dort—the Virginia man whose father invented the special generators stolen by the Nazis and used on their \"Electro-U-boats\"—said that, when the 'snoring' was at its peak and the disk stationary, that the meter wa s at the \"center of load\", which meant that the amount of current being used was equal to that being generated by the meters! When the disks reversed, the 'meters' were genera ting more current than that being used, and were putting electricity back into the grid! After I removed the old meters from the circuits, my bill increased by one-third. By th at standard, I may have been able to reduce the usage to practically zero, by connecti ng meters the same way in the other three residences, or by running all my current through the meters. Under the generally accepted theory of el ectric power generation (inductance), a magnetic field and cond uctor are required. A dynamic c onductor must 'cut' stationary magnetic 'lines of force', or dynamic 'lines of force' must expand and contract across a stationary conductor, to create the cutting action necessary to produce current in the conductor. Since energy is expended by use of alternating current to create an expanding and contracting magnetic field, the use of permanent magnets—which require no current to create their fields—is considered most efficient, except where it is desireable to have a reversing magnetic field in the core. The Tesla electric meter has weak magnets, which Tesla said was necessary so the magnetic fiel ds could be reversed and alternated. The meter wouldn't work if it had very strong, completely polarized magnets. There are two basic ways the Tesla 'meter' can be used as a generator, as far as I can tell: 1. Mechanical: The disk may be rotated in the weak permanent magnet field, by a small motor connected to the shaft of the aluminum disk, generating an electric current in the disk. The current rises until sufficient to cancel the magnetic field, which it then reverses, as the current in the disk collapses and reverses, due to the reversed magnetic field, and the system begins to oscillate. An alternating output current is induced in the windings of the two sets of pole-pieces whic h are above and below the gap in which the disk rotates. 2. Electromagnetic: With this method, th e current is run parallel through the windings of the pole pieces of two separate meters, creating a magnetic flux which alternately passes through the disk, and into the lower pole pieces, creating a current at right angles in the disk, which creates a thrust which rotates the disk in the weak magnetic field of the permanent magnets. When the current in the disk is sufficient to cancel the weak permanent magnetic fields, the disk stops , then \"vibrates\" (\"s nores\"), as it rapidly and alternately reflects and transmits both th e current and the magne tic fields, producing an output alternating current in the pole piece windings. According to Mr. Dort, aluminum is the best \"reflector\", copper the \"most active\" (electronically conductive) , and iron the \"magnetic core mate rial\". Dort said his father's magnetic drive was based on a Te sla generator. Based on the drive system stolen from Dort's father by the Nazis, and used on th e Electro-U Boats, Grand Admiral Karl Doenitz promised Hitler a \"miracle at sea\". How did the Tesla generator work? The particular Tesla genera tor used by Dort's father—and the Nazis—was one which was being developed by Tesla in 1895, in c onjunction with his developments concerning the liquifaction of air. Tesla knew, from Lord Kelvin's discoveries, that more heat is ALIENS284"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"absorbed by liquified air when it is re-gasif ied and used to drive something, than is required by theory, in other words, that the liquifaction process is somewhat anomalous or 'over unity' 16 . Just prior to Tesla's completion of his work, and the filing of a patent application, Tesla's laboratory was burned down, destroying all his equipment, models and inventions. Immediately after the fire , Linde, in Germany, filed 'his' patent application for the exact same process, whic h recombined some of the heat energy produced in compression of the air, to dr ive the process, just as Tesla had done. Tesla had combined the liquified air pro cess, with his pneu matic piston-driven oscillator, even prior to the fire and Linde' s patent application. In addition, he had calculated that, for every 200 pounds of iron connected to the devi ce, a full horsepower was added to it. Can you imagine how many horsepower were added by the connection of the oscillator and liquifaction device to th e body of a submarine? If hypothetically a Type XXI German submarine were retr o-fitted with this oscillator , and its displacement were 2,700 tons, that would produce an extra 27,000 h. p., only a small part of which would be needed to drive the oscillat or, which involved very little friction and force to produce a large current. The Tesla oscillator developed by Dort's father, used on the Nazi Electro-U-Boats, is shown in my following simplified, clarified illustrations, based on Tesla's originals: 16 Nikola Tesla, Startling Prediction of the World's Greatest Living Scientist (Article, the North American, May 18, 1902). ALIENS285"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"The inductor-shaft of this oscillator wa s driven by the small pneumatic piston, powered by the liquid air. The shaft needed to vibrate only about 1/16 inch, producing a mere 'hum', which Tesla said was capable of vibrating a system of considerable weight \"..many thousands of times per minute\" 17 (standard 60 cps woul d be 3,600 times per minute). It is assumed that the increased horsepower from the iron of the sub, was combined thermodynamic energy added to drive the liquifier, as well as energy received by the oscillator from the same ELF transmitter which could also send messages. The iron could maintain the flow of heat liberated from the air as it was being compressed and cooled, and from the iron where it was stored, back to the air (in a Carnot cycle) when being expanded to drive the piston. At the sa me time, the iron could act as an antenna to receive earth's electrical en ergy being regulated by the 'transmitter' at a distance, electrical energy of stationary waves traversing the earth from pole to pole, as finally confirmed by Tesla during his 1899 Colorado Sp rings experiments. The iron collected electromagnetic energy from the earth system to be added to the electrical power of the oscillator as it was driving an Electro-U-Boa t's motors and charging batteries. As stated by Tesla in 1898 18 , (in pertinent part): \"Primarily, I contemplated only the sending of messages to great distances in this manner. \" \"Now, this idea I extended to a system of power transmission.\" The windings on the oscillator were about 50 miles in length, and its inductive- capacitive system allowed it to operate on a frequency which was consistent with the earth's, at a wavelength of about 925 miles, with a frequency close to 13.5 c.p.s., sometimes mentioned in relation to Naval ELF communications. Was this part of Tesla's long wave system for \"transmiss ion of electric energy without wires\", which he said he had completed just prior to his death, as sh own in the FBI documents? Is the Navy's ELF (\"Extremely Low Frequencies\") system not onl y for communications, just as Tesla said, but also for broadcasting energy to submarin es—just as Tesla also said? This submarine power system is now a top secret of the U.S. Navy. They could have had in 1943 if they had not listened to their \"experts\", who conv inced them Tesla was crazy, something they can blame on Einstein's \"R.Q.Ms\". They ha d paid no attention to Tesla when he attempted to interest the Navy in the same kind of technology in 1901 19 . The German government had wasted no time in taking Tesla seriously. When Tesla's laboratory was burned down in 1895, Linde file d his patent on the liquefaction of air, identical to the system developed and test ed by Tesla in conjunction with running his oscillator. The German Ministry of Marine pur chased Tesla's turbine right after the U.S. Navy rejected Tesla's attempts to interest them in it first. By 1905, German chemical interests had already begun liquefying and storin g thousands of gallons of liquefied air in steel bottles, in anticipation of their need for it in the coming submarine warfare. Today, the discoveries of Tesla are still classified, over 56 years after his death, yet these discoveries laid in storage with th e Alien Properties Custodian between 1943 and 1945, during which time no one even bothered to take a look, until after the war, when German research revealed to the U.S. government that Tesla's discoveries were valuable, and the basis for flying saucer technology an d many other still classified developments. 17 Patent for Tesla's Valvular Conduit, No. 1,329,559, Feb. 3, 1920. 18 The Sun, New York, Nov. 21, 1898. 19 The Transmission of Electrical Energy Without Wi res As a Means for Furthe ring Peace, Nikola Tesla, ELECTRICAL WORLD AND ENGINEER, Jan. 7, 1905.

The original purposes of the Declaration of Independence stated by Thomas Jefferson and other American revolutionaries, on Jury 4, 1776—only two months after Weishaupt's declaration—were good, also referri ng to \"...Nature and Nature's God\", just as Weishaupt had done. The original purposes of Michael Bakunin, in the founding of his Internationale (the Alliance Internationale Sociale Democratique), in Switzerland, in 1864, was good...seeking an instrument to destroy the tyranny of the confiscatory state, and motivated by a genuine horror of hi s own experiences under despotism. The original purposes of Theodor Hertzl, in calling together the first International Zionist Congress, of March, 1897, in Basl e, Switzerland, were good, advocating that \"...sovereignty be granted us over a portion of the globe large enough to satisfy the rightful requirements of a nation,\" intended by He rtzl to be guided by the individualistic premises of Friedrich Nietzsche. The problem with these and similar endeavors, is that the Pseudo-Illuminati—by whatever name we know of it—lurks behind the scenes, more ruthless, powerful, and thorough than ever, always poised to take ove r and convert all organizations to its own use, in a manner diametrically opposite to its stated purposes. Organizations and movements originally intended to create a new religion of \"reas on and nature\", were converted into ones for the mass psychological mind control of society, using religion, political mysticism and superstition to prohi bit the higher development of mankind, to conceal technology, truth and higher knowledge , and to create and maintain a false economic dependence on Illuminati-controlled go vernments and the archaic technology of Illuminati industries. Meanwhile, the me dical establishments and world health organizations are controlled and used to distri bute and conceal popula tion control methods developed and expedited by secret military we apons laboratories, so as to maintain world populations at \"controllable levels\". The Illuminati, hypocritically styling its elf as the \"...Bringer of Light and Knowledge...\", preys upon the sincere beliefs of religious people, and promotes irrational, mystical, superstitious or exploi tative ideas or means, contrary to what might have been initially good purposes, showing the consciously designed, sociopathic conspiracy to control the world through deceitfully planned ignorance, mysticism, dependency, and the promotion and exploitation of weakness.

This question was first begged in religious 'creationist' myths of the most infantile sort, just as UFOlogists begged the question that flying saucers are extraterrestrial. A god in the image of man, space aliens in the image of man, and 'extraterrestrial' flyi ng saucers in the image of man-made flying saucers. On the issues of G od, the Big Bang, Space Aliens, and Flying Saucers, rational people have been crowded into a corner as the 'nut cases', defending the \"irrational\" positions of the nonexistence of God, the infinity of the universe, the absence of evidence of aliens, and the terrestrial origins of flying saucers. That time has now ended. The Big Liars can prevail only by exerting absolute control over the press, public speech, and the media. They are now frantica lly multiplying their redundant Tired Old Big Lies in the public media. The Illuminati eventually ca me to secretly advocate the use of unethical and murderous methods by its members, to cause unnecessary struggle and conflict of every kind, and to exploit mystical religious or po litical organizations, racial concentrationism, and military nationalism, in orde r to set up conflicts needed to create constant chaos and instability, in the midst of which they main tain and increase their wealth and economic control. The Jesuit and Masonic orders fell to Illu minati control, as did Bakunin's Anarchist Internationale (expropriated by Marx and hi s Communists). The Am erican Government fell to Illuminati control, vi a exploitation of the conveniently covert natures of the CIA, FBI, NSA, the Masonic Order, the Jesuits, the Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Bilderberg group. After the 1919 failure of \"Morgenthau's Pastoral Policy\" to exterminate the \"German race\", at the end of WW I, the S.S. was formed later that same year, as an experiment in mass psychological control, fina nced by the World Bank ers, the Rockefeller Commission (now the Trilateral Commission), acting through the S.S., under the auspices of the Hogg Foundation for Mental Health and \"Eugenics Program\" of the University of Texas, and the American Psychiatric Associa tion. Their purpose was the control of the world through religion. To this end, a ne w religion, called \"O STARA \"—'designed' by Georg Lanz von Liebenfels—was promoted thr ough the S.S. and the Thule Society. This new Nazi religion used ancient religious mythology as its basis, falsely depicting the 'gods' as \"aliens\". For example, the Egyptian God of Darkness, Apepi (Apophis), a serpent, was claimed to be a \"reptilian alie n god\" which lived under the Great Pyramid at Giza. In the mass-psychology experi ment, the Nazi alien religion was used to stretch the credulity of the German people, so they would believe whatever Big Lies their government told them. It was decided in 1923 that Adolf Hi tler was to lead the German people in this experiment, to culminate in a mass suicid e of the German people, in a \"Wagnerian tragedy\", then to fake his own suicide and ma ke his secret exit.
