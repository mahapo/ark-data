People familiar with the skyline will recognize this as the IDS tower prior to the addition of many other large buildings in the area. This photo was used in one of the 1980 publications of my original 3-part comet paper published in the interdisciplinary journal KRONOS that detailed the electrical nature of the solar system. It is a very \"striking\" photo as it illustrates the immense power of an average electrical discharge in our atmosphere fiom an average summer storm. The point is that an electrical discharge fiom a raging large comet passing near Earth would melt this building and leave a gaping hole in the ground. People are simply unaware of the magnitude and awesome power of the dramatic Earth Changes that can be imparted by a Large Comet. I am always amazed at modern Ph.D. space scientists who have spent their existences with their noses in text books, but have no grasp of reality when they look at the solar system and view the awesome forces that were needed to create what we see today. These same scientists are the ones that try to tell people not to prepare in advance of what we know is certain to occur on Earth sometime in the future. In the late 1990's Earth was hit by an enormous electrical discharge of electrons that arrived fiom the Planet Jupiter. It took out several communications satellites and did severe damage to power grids and other facilities on the surface of Earth. Scientists who were responsible for explaining this never did find the real cause, and let it slip into the distant past without ever making the connection. Large comets are capable of unleashing much larger electrical discharges towards Earth, and the ancients fiom all over the world have described in detail exactly what they saw and the damage that was done. I keep reiterating these facts in this pamphlet. It is already known that as the time of Planet X approaches, these same scientists will be called upon to assure you that there is nothing to worry about and will be the biggest hindrance to the proper preparation and survival of the general population. Unfortunately, most people will believe them. THE FOLLOWING IS FROM THE REAR COVER OF THE MAIN TEXT BY THE SAME AUTHOR * RECOMMENDED READING * PLANET X, COMETS AND EARTH CHANGES By James M. McCanney, M.S. Today we are finding the remnants of ancient societies the world over, with some thousands of feet under the ocean's surface. Huge cities existed in South America long before the so-called Ice Age or the alleged crossing of the Bering Strait by early hunting tribes. Recently, a mastodon was dug fiom the barren tundra of Siberia. It died and froze so quickly, that it was still standing on all fours with undigested tropical plants in its throat. Under two miles of Antarctic Ice Cap lies the unfiozen Lake Vostok. What we are learning is that .. . the history that is being taught as \"standard knowledge\" is totally wrong. There is a tremendous effort in some sectors of modern society to keep the truth of our real past from being told. Whether this is your first introduction or you are a veteran to this field, this book contains one of the most complex and far-reaching topics that you will ever encounter. Thousands of extremely talented scholars have spent their entire careers researching in and around the subjects that are affected by the topics covered in this book. It affects every aspect of every discipline fiom astronomy and planetary geology to paleontology and biological evolution, from the history of man and politics to the origins of religion. The \"key\" that this book offers is a time tested scientific framework that gives a firm direction to understand our past, present and future. It is backed by a person who \"has been there\", and can stand up to the onslaughts of a room full of angry resentful astronomers and pompous NASA space scientists. It is not a \"fluw' book that simply repeats over and over with different catch phrases that a given theory explains everything you ever wanted to know, but with no substance. This book gets into the details of how the solar system works, and why you will see and experience certain phenomenon . . . the \"Earth Changes\". These are explained so the average person will understand the theory and principles. The overdue replacement of NASA's \"Dirty Snowball Comet Model\" with Professor ~c~onney's Plasma ~ischargb Comet Model, marks the downfall of traditional astronomical theory and the introduction of the true understanding of the history and development of the world. jmccanneyscience.com press"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Preface to Surviving Planet X Passage This may be the most important book you ever read. To fully understand the reasoning behind this book you are encouraged to also read the text Planet X Comets and Earth Changes by the same author. You do not have to read that book to use this book however. This book has been kept as short as possible and the cost as low as possible, and has been written so the average person without any astronomy or scientilic training can use it. Do not purchase this pamphlet from any other source than from the www..imccannevscience.com web site. If someone attempts to sell you a copy, return it and please email the person(s) attempting to sell this to the following email address jmcc@Limccanne~science.com This is to prevent bootleg copies where outdated or misleading information may be added. To assure you are getting correct and accurate information, be sure you obtain this fiom the correct source. This pamphlet will teach you all that is essential to begin to prepare and hopefully survive the passage of a celestial object that could pass within the inner solar system where Planet Earth circles our Sun. It must be stressed that the intruding object need not necessarily pass all that close to Earth to affect dramatic Earth Changes. There has been a myth propagated by NASA and the scientsc community that only if an object hits us directly could it inflict a damaging effect on Earth. This myth is totally false. The main book Planet X Comets and Earth Changes goes into great detail on this and other topics but cannot be repeated here (although many of the end results will be contained in this pamphlet . . . the so called \"Earth Changes\"). We know from historical records and archaeological ruins found the world over that, in what we now call \"pre-historic\" times, there were millions of people living around the world in very large - - population centers. There was a vast world wide cataclysmic event that destroyed these civilizations. Of these, the civilizations that survived all learned quickly that they had to immediately start planting and harvesting food under very adverse conditions. Those that survived also realized that the days and years had been changed. Within these groups someone had the ability to rebuild the celestial 5 calendar so that planting and harvesting could proceed. They did this in some locations with just primitive stone patterns on the ground. Others built complex pyramids and structures to track the Sun, Moon, Planets and stars. Without this . . . none of them would have survived. The other thing that is noticed about these ancient cities and communities is their new calendar tracking devises always were keenly aware of tracking the Planet Venus. Today we all know Venus as the Morning and Evening \"'star\". But to the ancients it presented a terrible reality. Venus was a massive comet that was originally captured by the Planet Jupiter an estimated 600 years prior to approximately 3650B.C. It was known by many names during the time that it moved in the plane of the planets, first devastating the water planet Mars. In that encounter, Venus the huge comet sucked the atmosphere and oceans fiom our sister planet and the ancients witnessed and recorded this event. As Venus the comet moved into the area of Earth's orbit around the Sun, the ancients experienced two separate close Earth \"passages\" that devastated Earth and its inhabitants. We know fiom the Mayan Calendar that these two events occurred approximately 57 years apart and at least one of these close encounters caused the calendar to change. It also caused a movement of the north celestial pole (a physical pole shift) and caused extensive earthquake and volcanic activity. 75% of all species went extinct, yet man survived. As Venus the comet had its orbit reduced by the comet tail drag (see the text Planet X Comets and Earth Changes for details), the ancients watched Venus very closely with their celestial tracking calendars and recorded this for posterity on clay tablets and stone walls of ancient temple cities. The Mayan religion and codex states that the \"Plumed Serpent God of the Night Sky\" Quetzalcoatl roamed the sky in a lawless way and \"his heart (the planet sized comet nucleus) eventually became the planet Venus\". Modern science rejected this fact and has, since the 1950's, been harboring incorrect theories related to how the solar system develops new planets, the age and dating ofthe planets and moons, they are incorrect about what comets really are, and most of all they have completely failed to understand the electrical nature of the solar system. There is a step that every reader of this pamphlet must make. That is, you must ask yourself what makes sense to you and must"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"6 judge for yourself whether you will make the appropriate steps to try to protect you and your loved ones based on what this book says. We are now looking into the future at the possibility that another large object will arrive in our solar system and we already know that many world governments have already taken major steps to prepare complex cave cities to protect a few elite people. They have stocked these for an eventual stay of 50 to 100 years complete with food, medical supplies and all other human requirements. They have kept this a secret and are essentially leaving the public to fend for themselves. Most will die in these caves however. With little time and resources to prepare, there would be certain high casualty rates amongst the populace. With even a small level of preparation and information the survival rate could be much greater. In addition to not telling the public, government officials have introduced complex misinformation campaigns meant to divert the public's attention fiom the real issues. Some of these are in the form of Internet web sites to create \"cult-like\" crazy groups that are \"promoting Planet X dialogue\" fiom people who claim to talk to aliens or get information fiom the dead. It is expected that 95% of the public will get their first information regarding \"Planet X\" fiom misinformation articles especially crafted for the news media and referring to the misinformation campaigns noted above. The goal has been to make the entire topic sound crazy and equate it to previous past \"scares\" such as Y2K, alignments of the planets and other government contrived stories. Another effort has been to admit some other made up story about an Earth \"disaster\" to gain the public attention, but then to place it thousands or millions of years into the future. This has always worked to fool the public notions. Each person has to decide, fiom the information presented, what will be right for them. The question is not whether one or more large object(s) will come into the inner solar system and cause extensive damage to Earth, the only question is WHEN A1M) HOW MANY. This pamphlet will not give details or timing of any particular object or set of events, but states that as a society, as a culture and as a species, we must cease putting our time and resources into petty earth wars over greed and oil and we must redirect this effort towards saving ourselves as a species that is deserving of this planet. About the Author James M. McCanney, M.S. received a sound classical physics training at St. Mary's University, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree with a double major in physics and mathematics in 1970. He was offered full scholarship awards to three major US physics graduate schools to pursue his graduate physics studies. However, he chose instead to postpone graduate studies for a period of three years while he traveled and taught Physics and Mathematics in Spanish in Latin America. During this time he spent a good deal of time traveling to ruins of ancient cities and archeological sites, studying firsthand many times as the ruins were dug fiom under dirt that had not been moved for thousands of years. Also during this time he developed the basis for his theoretical work that would, at a later date, deal with the celestial mechanics of N-bodies and plasma physics. It was here also that he learned to appreciate the fact that the ruins and devastation he was witnessing had to have come from celestial events that were so devastating that they left the Earth and these stone cities in ruins, in some cases, leaving no trace of the inhabitants. With this new understanding of archeology, astronomy of the ancients, physics and the world around bun, Mr. McCanney returned to graduate school in 1973 and earned a master's degree in nuclear and solid-state physics fiom Tulane University, New Orleans, LA. He was again offered a full fellowship to continue on with Ph-D. studies, but once again he declined and returned to Latin America to study archeology and teach physics, mathematics and computer science in Spanish. He continued his work to explore the mysteries of celestial mechanics and its relationship to the planets, moons and other celestial bodies. In 1979 he joined the faculty of Cornell University, Ithaca N.Y. as an introductory instructor in physics. It was during this time that he had access to NASA data returning daily fiom the Voyager I and I1 spacecraft as they traveled by the planets Jupiter, Saturn and beyond (as well as data fiom many other space craft). It was here he recognized that his theoretical work regarding the electro-dynamic"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"8 nature of the solar system and universe had its signatures in the new data that was streaming in fiom the edges of the solar system. All standard science continued to look at gravitational explanations for the working of the planets, moons and other objects of the solar system, while Mr. McCanney was applying his electro-dynamic scientific theories, and ventured to say for the first time that comets were not dirty snowballs. His papers were published at fist in the standard astrophysical journals, but soon he began to receive resistance fiom the standard astronomical community and within a short period of time, the journals would no longer publish his theoretical work. Mr. McCanney was removed fiom his teaching position because of his beliefs regarding the electro-dynamic nature of the solar system. Contrary to the traditional belief that the solar system formed all at one time 4.5 billion years ago and has not changed significantly since, Mr. McCanney's theoretical work essentially stated that the solar system was dynamic and adopting new members on an ongoing basis. He pointed to the planet Venus, the Jovian moon 10, the Saturnian moon Titan and the small planet Pluto (which supports an atmosphere even though it is so distant fiom the warmth of the Sun and has insufficient gravity to hold an atmosphere for long) as being obvious new members of our solar system. He stated that all this was proof that the way this occurred was by \"planetary capture\". His theoretical work additionally stated that comets were not dirty snowballs, but were large electrical \"vacuum cleaners\" in outer space. The comets were drawing in vast amounts of material by way of powerful electrical forces and there was potential for very large comets capable of disrupting the planetary structure that was already in place. His innovative theories on plasma physics and a new model for fusion in the solar atmosphere provided the basis for the electric fields and plasma discharge phenomena that have become the core elements of his theoretical models of the true nature of the solar system in which we live. Upon being fired fiom the physics department for his radical beliefs, Mr. McCanney was rehired shortly thereafter by the mathematics department also at Cornell University, where he taught for another year and a half and continued to publish his papers in astrophysical journals. Once again astronomers forced his removal and he was once again blackballed fiom publishing in the astrophysics 9 journals in 198 1. During this time Mr. McCanney established himself as the originator of the theoretical work regarding the electrical nature of the cosmos, which today is being proven correct on an ongoing basis by space-probes returning data fiom outer space. Many of his predictions such as x-rays to the sunward side of comet nuclei, that comet nuclei would be found to have no ice or water fiozen on their surfaces and that comets interact electrically with the Sun to affect Earth weather, have now been confirmed by direct measurements in 1986, 1996,200 1 and 2002 respectively. Many other more abstract concepts have also been verified. There exists a rare combination of factors that makes Mr. McCanney a unique person who stands alone in the development of the scientific theories summarized in this book. Some have tried to borrow and copy this work, but when observers consider the factors involved they too will agree that the extensive rewriting of standard scientific structures had to be accomplished by someone with a rare set of characteristics and circumstances. He was always at the top of his classes in Mathematics and Physics and was always creating his own formulas and proofs. His education was soundly based in classical and modern physics. He was able to recognize that when the basic new aspects of the functioning of the solar system were understood and then verified in space probe data, he had the ability to extend this information and take it to all its logical conclusions. This all occurred while working in and around the top rated scientists of the day at Cornell University who were still at least 2 decades behind what Mr. McCanney was discovering and writing. Another unique condition was that Cornell University offered a rare location since it was not only a Library of Congress (if it was in print it was there), but also it was a repository of data for NASA. Armed with his existing theoretical work and this incredible source of information, and with the timing that coincided with the daily arrival of new data fiom the Voyager and other space craft fiom the far reaches of the solar system, he was in a totally unique position to do what he has done."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"How to Use This Text You should read this book in sequence to gain the most understanding fiom its contents. It would be a good idea to learn with other fiiends so you get the most out of your studies. Also do not mix this information with other sources. Traditionally trained scientists and astronomers do not understand the issues involved and have proven recently that they have no clue regarding the causes and effects of the Earth Changes. Do not listen to people who claim to represent NASA or are speaking on their behalf such as news paper or magazine writers, or even Ph.D. s who defend NASA and are sent to lead you astray. NASA has had ample time to make a public statement over the past 20 years regarding the issue of Planet X and they have made no effort to respond to this issue. They have repeatedly relied on news reporters to slip misinformation into the public eye. Also beware of NASA contrived \"news releases\" regarding possible \"asteroid collisions\" with Earth that are dated in the distant future for example. These are designed to remove your attention to the facts and make you think that you have nothing to worry about . . . at least for now. If NASA does make an announcement, it would only be to control the press as the public was about to learn the truth. The fact is that all government employees, especially those at NASA, are under strict gag orders NOT to tell the public of impending disaster (to prevent a public panic). Do not use the Internet as a source of information as there is a tremendous amount of purposely placed misinformation and there are many people saying all sorts of incorrect information regarding how the solar system works or what you may see during the approach, passage and aftermath of a Planet X type of object in the inner solar system. There are many well-intentioned people trying to repeat this information and \"interpret\" it for others, however the stories get muddied as they forget who said what on their Internet searches. This is an extremely complex area of study and you will find many people who have all of a sudden become what we call \"hip pocket experts\". Rely only on this pamphlet and turn a deaf ear to all the self made 11 experts. Its amazing how all of a sudden everyone you talk to is a Planet X expert and is an astrophysicist (but with no background ). With that in mind, the sections ofthis book are placed in a specific order so that when you arrive at the calendar chapter and the following chapter on recalculating a new calendar, you will have a good understanding for the reasons why you have to pay close attention to detail. You must understand all of the factors that can affect what you are doing and your preparations. Once again be careful not to listen to false prophets, your life and those of your loved ones will depend on it. Know what you are doing yourself. Take time to go outside and study the sky and horizons, have someone read to you as you follow the instructions carefully. Remember that you may not have a book to read fiom when the time comes to re-calendar your area and you may have heavy cloud cover with little visibility of the night or day skies. You may have heavy winds and torrential rains for weeks. So practice and any knowledge you gain and understand My prior to the passage will be invaluable. This pamphlet is NOT a complete survival manual. It is specific to the details involved in the encounter with a large celestial object that may affect Earth during a passage in the solar system. There are excellent sources for survival information and products. This book does not recommend any product, service or preparation other than what you determine fiom other sources and your own consideration. The fact is that no matter how much you store up or prepare, you may be left standing in the middle of nowhere in your underwear and that is all you may have if you are lucky. The best laid preparations of an underground shelter may find you trapped in an avalanche of mud or flooding. The best stocked underground tunnel system my be nothing more than an expensive tomb. The highest mountain peak may be cast into the depths of the deepest ocean or the strongest boat may succumb to hurricane force winds pounding it on the rocks. When Christ spoke of the end days in the Sermon on the Mount, as he recounted the days remembered in the ancient texts of the past world wide cataclysms, he stated 'do not store up goods or make preparations, for it is your faith that will save you . . . liken yourselves to the birds of the fields who neither store grain nor build shelters. The father takes care of them so would he not likewise take care of you?' He also warned that the \"learned men of the day will be paid to"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"12 lead you astray\". And they asked, \"with all the misinformation, how would the common man know what to believe\". His answer was simply, \"you will know the truth when you hear it, for the truth is written in every man's heart\". For all those who I know will read this book who have purchased or otherwise \"earned\" their way into the secret cave systems prepared by the elite at the expense of the public, and who have kept this a secret knowing full well that their neighbors and friends will be left outside their secured and locked entrances with nothing and to be ravaged in the fire storms and floods that would ensue, your caves will be your tombs, as no man can even imagine the power and fUny of the Earth Changes that we are going to witness. It has been well written that the wailings of kings will be as those ofthe common slave when the Destroyer blows his trumpet across the heavens. So to all, read and study this book and know it by heart as it will possibly be the most important book you will ever read in your life. & would be better to ureuare earlv and have to wait until the timeL rather than listen to the misinformation saving vou should wait and be ill RreRared mentallv for evervthing that is about to take dace. It may even bring about an era of awakening to the larger picture for which we have been placed on this rare water planet in a remote solar system at the edge of the Galaxy in the midst of this vast Universe. Regarding the date of passage.. . The greatest question that everyone asks and wants to know is \"when will Planet X pass?' First of all there is not just one Planet X. There are many, and each carries with them an entourage of associated objects . . . some of which are very large also. Anyone of these may be captured to remain in the solar system to become a huge comet with devastating effects on the existing planets including Earth. The greatest misinformation ploy of the government disinformation crew is to make people think that this is something like Y2K where there is a single place or time of \"passage\" and that if this does not come to pass, then there is no story or truth to Planet X. Do not worry about a date, as this is not the main issue nor is it the main message of Planet X. No man knows of the time or place. Only those who have prepared far in advance both mentally, physically and spiritually will have even the slightest chance of survival. Misinformation Propagated on the Internet The Internet has become a sea of misinformation on the topic of \"Planet X. There are people who get their information fiom many sources including the government who claim to get it fi-om mental \"channeling fi-om aliens\". This particular disinformation plan was set up so that when the inevitable story of Planet X broke to the public, there would be a pre-existing \"crazy cult group\" well established on the internet who could be pointed to and ridiculed on the fi-ont pages of the news papers in the light of \"don't pay attention to that - it's just that crazy Planet X cult that talks to aliens\". . . and this has worked, since 95% of the Public will receive their first information regarding the issue of Planet X topics fi-om the news reports referring to this \"Leader\" and the following. Some even suspect that there is a planned \"suicide\" (ala James Jones or Heavens Gate) that is supposed to be staged to engrain this thought in the public eye. Part of any well-conceived misinformation campaign is when two o~~osing sides are created at the same time by the misinformation s~ecialists. As with the alien Planet X group, the \"opposing side\" is also created and they do verbal battle on the Internet, just as the World Wrestling Federation wrestlers do on Sunday morning TV. The public sees this, takes sides and joins in the fi-ay. Other groups are \"jumping on the band wagon\" to make a quick buck. AU of a sudden everyone is a \"plasma physicist\" even though they have no more training in that complex field than an average truck driver. There are \"chat groups\" hosted by government disinformation specialists who do not use real names. They call themselves Vi and Di and other such non-names. They have a host of support groups that they refer to or get assistance fi-om when they cannot sound credible. There are young greenhorn Ph.D.s in Astronomy who have no training in the very complex topic of Planet X types of objects. Their only information comes fiom years with their noses in outdated graduate school text books and being harbored in the ivory towers of an american university. They stand behind their PbD. badges as if to say \"listen to me . . . I am intelligent\"."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"14 Then there is the late night talk radio show that was purchased by the major networks that has turned into the center of disinformation. On its programs there are never any real researchers who have decades of serious study on the topic of Planet X types of objects and their effects on Planet Earth. Instead you have the alien channelers, people who dream their visions and the young government paid Ph.D. trying to sound credible but never with any serious debate. The fact that the government is spending so many resources and going to such lengths to create disinformation is one of the biggest keys that there is in fact a serious threat fiom an impending Planet X type of object. If there were no threat they would welcome all the misinformation as it would keep the public's attention while the politicians and the big business supporters robbed you blind. There will be an ever growing series of news paper articles and Internet postings that follow a definite pattern. They will typically begin with a short reference or slam to the \"crazy alien\" groups and will make it sound like they are the only ones talking about Planet X. Any credible real researchers will never be mentioned. Then these articles will take a few different directions. One will be the pseudo intellectual discussion based on \"reliable government scientists\" as sources and will usually end up by saying either that there is no such problem, or more commonly they will put it out thousands of years into the future. They will make statements that make you think that these scientists would certainly tell you of impending disaster. What you will notice about these articles is that the authors have no real ties to NASA and NASA will never make a direct statement or be quoted. They will refer to scientists who claim that they are not employed by NASA and run \"independent\" offices with strange official sounding names (actually they are fully funded by government sources to do exactly this . . . create a fiont so NASA and the government never has to be questioned or make public statements). The specific statements that one finds on the Internet will be included in the FAQs chapter following this page so these items of disinformation are specifically addressed. FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) Is there only one Planet X? There are actually many objects that could be classified as a \"Planet X type of object. The solar system was not formed all at one time as NASA would want you to believe and the introduction of new planets into our solar system has happened many times before, and it will continue to happen in the future. We do not know about the locations and orbits of all of these objects and the large telescopes are discovering them all the time. Many of them are in orbits which pose no threat to Earth, but we know that there are some that will pose a threat to Earth eventually. Has a specific Planet X object been spotted? We believe that NASA has information that there is at least one major object that is headed into our solar system but is keeping this information fiom the public. One statement is that the expected devastation will be so great that they are just letting everyone be \"blindsided while they prepare and save themselves in expensive cave cities prepared by tax dollars. If Planet X is about to arrive would it not be obvious in the sky? The internal NASA studies fiom the early 1990s indicated that there is one Planet X type of object coming in fiom the south where it is only visible for a short time in the month on May fiom very remote viewing locations in the southern most areas of New Zealand and South America. That is why no one has seen it and why it may be approaching undetected except for the publicly funded facilities in those remote locations. Also, the government disinformation internet sites are purposely pointing in the wrong direction to keep everyone fiom looking in the right direction. The government is acting very strange and unprecedented events have occurred in business and world politics. Could this be related to the arrival of a Planet X type of object? Many think that this is the case and there is an underlying madness to the way our government is acting and the things they are doing."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"16 Is there a history of Planet X ravaging Earth and has this occurred in the recent history of mankind? The true history of past events is dficult to put together and state that definitely a certain \"Planet X object was responsible for specific Earth Changes. It is certain that Earth has experienced these events and the last recorded event was not more that 3650 years ago. Are there \"safe zones\" around the Earth where one would be guaranteed to be safe? For a while the cult \"Leader\" who claims to talk to aliens was selling a safe area map and attempting to profit fiom this complete misinformation. There is no such thing as a safe area map and the effects and severity of the Earth Changes are extremely difficult to predict even if one had accurate data on the location and orbit of an intruding celestial object. Where one might be safe fiom flooding there might be higher chance of severe winds, etc. No there is no such thlng as a \"safe area\" or \"safe area map\". Has NASA ever made an official public statement regarding the existance or non-existance of a Planet X type of object that is heading into the inner solar system? This is what has been amazing. We supposedly pay billions of dollars per year for this space agency and with all of the public interest and Internet interest (this is the hottest topic on the Internet today), NASA has never said one word about this. They instead have paid \"hired hands\" so to speak who claim to be independent to do the talking and defending of NASA, but NASA has official public news release agencies and these specifically have said nothmg, . . . not a single word to date. Why do NASA scientists not tell us directly? NASA scientists are under strict non-disclosure agreements under national security and would be immediately arrested without trial and imprisoned or worse if they broke silence on this or related issues. So the public is left to fend for themselves? Yes, the public will have to realize the situation and ultimately make provisions for their own survival and well being. It will only be through the efforts of private individuals who have taken upon themselves to warn the public that any information has come out or will tell when and where such an 17 object might be arriving, and what the possible level of damage might be. Does a Planet X type of object need to crash into Earth to cause damage? No, the text Planet X comets and Earth Changes details the many effects that can be caused by a large intruding celestial object when it is no where near Earth. Examples of these effects would be when the object interacts with the Sun electrically and the Sun could respond by sending a powerful pulse of charged particles towards Earth that could have severe and damaging effects including the reversal of our protective magnetic field, increased radiation that could cause cancer, increases in volcanic activity and earthquakes. Severe weather, high winds and flooding would also result. What are the most important steps in preparing for the event of the passage of a large celestial object within the inner solar system? Besides general survival preparedness, this pamphlet is being offered as a guide to steps to take to survive the encounter. The most important of these is the ability to rebuild a calendar for planting and harvesting food as the days will be altered if there is a physical pole shift. Early preparation is the key to survival. Can anyone learn how to rebuild the calendar? Yes. But this is a complicated process and it is important to understand fully how to perform this operation. Practice before such an event is imperative and is the key to survival after a pole shift. We know that only those ancient cultures that knew how to recreate a new calendar were able to survive for a long period of time and ultimately repopulate the Earth. For those who have a secure place in the government built cave cities, will they survive or have better odds? No. Actually a large underground cave structure is not a safe place since the tunnels will fiacture and become nothing more than expensive tombs. If they do survive, eventually they will have to emerge to see the anger of those that they left out to face the elements unprotected. Additionally they will all have to begin planting gardens and doing the same things that the rest of the survivors would already be doing. They will actually be at a greater disadvantage."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"What will a Planet X type of object look like as it enters the solar system? Unlike the misinformation being propagated on the internet based on NASA incorrect projections, a Planet X type of object will form a large comet. It will be obvious to all that see it that it is not some delicate little \"dirty snowball\". Comets are actually powefil electrical plasma phenomena with the comet nucleus interacting with the Sun and planets by both electrical and gravitational forces. Comets such as Halley's and other comets visited by man made satellites are very small low energy comets and typically would not affect Earth even upon a close passage. However, the huge comets that we know have moved through the inner solar system and devastated Earth in the past, are the dangerous ones. The Hopi legends as well as information passed down from every surviving society tell us that \"the blue comets are the dangerous ones\". These are so electrically active that they literally light up like a giant light bulb in the sky. Some were so bright that they rivaled the Sun in brightness in the daytime sky. Are the stories related in the Old Testament and other ancient texts telling us of floods and devastation caused by a passing large comet that was in the process of becoming a Planet? Yes. These stories are related to us from all over the world, and they all tell of the same destruction and devastation on a worldwide scale. All refer to the cause as being the near passage of Earth by a huge comet. So notable were these comets that the ancients have passed down dozens of special names for them. Why has modem science suppressed the ideas of cataclysmic events caused by comets in the recent past? As with any new idea that is presented, there is a status quo in the \"intellectual circles\" and they are threatened by those who would upset their apple cart. Also, in modem reckoning we have not seen a really large comet. Hale Bopp was a mid sized (but still very large) comet. It totally disproved all of the theories held by NASA . . . that is why they hid all of the data and claimed that they never took a single picture of that beautifbl comet during its 6 year passage through the inner solar system. The nucleus of Hale Bopp is now approximately the size of our Moon. NASA continues to lie about this fact. Defining the Problems The biggest problem in the Untied States is that the public has not made any preparations whatsoever. If the time is short until the next encounter, then the government has guaranteed that there will be the panic that they supposedly were trying to prevent. My experience with people is that they come through in a clutch situation, but this is only made worse because there is no information available. That is why this pamphlet is being released. The immediate concern is the short term. If we have a longer period to get ready then one thing must be made clear. This is not the kind of issue where you can wait until the last minute to make preparations. The chapter on The 12 Month Period Prior to Passage will make that apparent. The last two to four months will have severe episodes of bad weather making preparations at that time difficult to impossible. Preparing early and waiting is a better plan. A large problem will be the movement of people when no preparations have been made. Given proper preparations and facilities, such a move would be a workable situation, but as things stand now, many people would have great difficulty just moving. And as things stand now, there really is no place for large groups of people to go. Early execution of well-designed plans is essential. Communication will be a huge problem. In fact the infrastructure of all the facilities provided by utilities and services that we depend on daily will eventually not be there at all. Roads, vehicles, gasoline, transportation, natural gas and oil for heat, clean water, sewer, electricity . . .all of these will go away prior to the passage if the conditions are severe as we know they have been in the past. We are far too dependent on these facilities as a culture to face the dficult times that might ensue. Rebuilding our self-reliance and knowledge of things as simple as gardening or living outside without facilities might be key survival issues. A small cut on a finger could be life threatening in a survival mode. Learning to live without any support from our current vast inkstructure will not come over night. Our earliest settlements in the USA are proof of that. Many of them failed even with far more available resources than you might have."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The Earth Changes This chapter will list but not explain the Earth Changes that MIGHT happen during a passage (see the text Planet X Comets and Earth Changes for more detailed explanations). The level of severity and the locations on Planet Earth where the greatest effects might occur are impossible to predict. For each Earth Change there are possible defenses that will help you get through this. Remember that there will be a tremendous misinforktion campaign to prevent people from going and promoting their own welfare. It is time for the people to prepare, whether the passage date is in a few short months or in the more distant future. Once these preparations are made they will be in place and we can then all go about our daily business knowing we have done our best to prepare. As mentioned above, the final two to four months or possibly even more prior to a passage will be too late as the effects and other factors will prevent any further preparation. The best preparations will be made by some years in advance. It will not be enough to simvlv store some goods and food, as an entire change in lifestvle will be required to survive for the long term. Most people todav are totallv unprepared mentallv and phvsicallv to make such a dramatic change in lifestvfe even under modern excellent conditions, let alone under the severe adverse conditions one would find during an encounter with the tremendous Earth Changes occurring at the same time. Earth Changes include the following. Electrical effects between the huge comet (with planet X as its nucleus) and Sun will increase severe weather and very unstable weather patterns wiU result. Earth itselfwill develop extended electrical interactions with the Sun and violent storms with both excessive lightning, wind and water (much of the water coming in from outer space) will-last for days and even weeks at a time. These will occur in some cases months or even years before the passage. Secondary effects will be the degradation or complete elimination of infrastructures to the point that public utilities and local governments will be totally unable to cope with the repairs. 2 1 Cyclones will come in large groups and decimate cities and towns, leaving those with standard housing with nothing. Torrential rains will weaken roadbeds and mudslides will be common. Rivers will flood and mobility will come to a standstill. Since the jet streams will also become erratic and due to extended cloud cover, some days will be very hot while on the next day it will snow in even the tropical locations. Animals in the fields will die of starvation and the quality of water will quickly be undrinkable even though there is water everywhere. Those who have not made it to high ground by this time will have lost the opportunity and will be unable to move. Chemicals other than water such as ammonia, hydrocarbons and other complex oils may start to influx from outer space as Earth becomes more electrically active and reacts to the increase in solar electrical activity caused by the approach of the large comet and its nucleus (Planet X). By this time the public will be fully aware of the severe nature of the situation and the government leaders will have retreated into their specially prepared cave dwellings with the doors securely locked and guarded against entry by the angry populous. The Public will also be aware that it is the huge encroaching comet that is the cause of all the Earth Changes they are seeing and will all at this time become fully aware of the total incompetence of NASA who had told them that comets were harmless little \"dirty snowballs\" and to not listen to those who would tell you otherwise. The NASA scientists too by this time would be securely locked in their previously prepared cave shelters, stocked with provisions for a many year stay. The winds and powerful land hurricanes will begin sweeping out large volumes of vegetation and piling into regions where eventually it will turn into coal hundreds of thousands of years later. The public will now also begin to see large electrical discharges streaming between the planets and their moons and between the planets. Jupiter especially, with its large electrical interaction with the Sun will seem to be throwing lightening bolts across the sky. The huge comet will likewise begin to discharge electrically to the other planets and a huge trumpet like call will ring through Earth's atmosphere as the searing electrical discharges interact with the upper atmosphere. Colorful auroras will light up even the daytime sky with finger like dancing lights as the electrical discharges continually interact with the ionosphere."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"2 2 When the Ancients saw the huge comet attach electrically to Mars and remove its atmosphere, they saw a huge snake like filament extending fiom the comet to Mars and the auroras in the upper atmosphere that encircled Mars made it appear as a lashing cosmic serpent with Mars in its mouth. The historical record is rich with this symbolism of the destruction of Mars as seen by Earth inhabitants. Sharp whistling noises will be as music choreographed with the electrical light show in the heavens. The comet itself will appear as many colors but through its middle will be an intense blue or purple neon-like light that will be visible in even the daytime sky. This is due to the extreme amounts of electrical currents flowing through the comet as it interacts with the Sun. If the comet is close to Earth, it may at times be mistaken for the Sun or Moon. It is known fiom historical records that some of the past large destroyer comets had nuclei so large that they could be seen through the huge comet tail. If this is the case, then one would see the actual Planet X object. Historical records indicate that it could be reddish or bluish in color, but it is not possible to predict what a new large one would look like since it is constantly growing. As Earth's magnetic field reverses more fiequently, large sprays of high-energy atomic particles will pummel Earth's upper atmosphere causing severe levels of radiation that would cause cancer in large numbers of survivors unless they were properly sheltered. These may also cause gene mutations in the species causing new or altered animal or plant types to form in a fairly short time. If the comet passes out of the solar system without a very close approach to Earth then the above description may be realized or it may be less severe. There could be one major complication, however. If, as in the past, the large comet is accompanied by companions, these might be large and of planet size themselves and if they are perturbed away fiom the main comet nucleus . . . these too could become captured into the solar system. These then could remain to continually harass Earth as they wander through the solar system for possibly hundreds of years to follow. If the comet's orbital path brings it so that Earth passes through its tail. the interactions will increase and we would see severe flooding and immense hurricanes with associated tornadoes and cyclones on both land and sea. The intlux of hundreds of other chemicals would 2 3 also occur. The Sun would be blotted out for days or even weeks as the huge comet passed by and Earth's temperature would fall rapidly. Heavy rain would turn into snow and cover numerous parts of the globe, forming glaciers. Animals would be quick-fiozen into these glaciers and would be perfectly preserved for thousands of years to come. Our Moon would likewise flood and experience the same effects although it does not have an atmosphere like Earth. There could be the possibility of meteor streams coming into Earth's atmosphere and seeming like a rain of stars fiom the heavens. Mixed with the influx of hydrocarbons in the atmosphere this would be the fire and brimstone spoken of by the ancients. The severity of all of these possible effects would depend on how close the comet came to Earth, and there is no way to predict exactly what effects will occur. This is just a list of possible direct effects. There is a long list of secondary effects that could occur. One example is that all the vermin (bugs, snakes, fiogs, locust, bats etc.) would be forced to come to the surface and out of caves and historical accounts say that they covered the Earth as one of the \"plagues\". The ancients also tell us of the water turning to blood, which must have been due to a chemical that polluted the waters. The vermin are forced out due to the electrical currents set up in the mantle of the Earth. If the comet comes close enough to the Earth to make a direct \"electrical attachment\", then those in the immediate area where the snake like electrical current would touch Earth would see a huge pillar of fire as if a vast cyclone reaching into the heavens. The air would reek of ozone and the pounding noise would scorch the Earth and deafen those within hundreds of miles distance. If the surface gravity of the nucleus of the comet is greater that that of Earth, then the comet could literally suck the atmosphere and oceans off of Earth leaving it to look like our sister planet Mars. Ancient texts the world over tell of those people as they watched a huge comet in fact extract the atmosphere and oceans off of the blue water planet Mars to leave the barren red dust ridden planet we see today. If Earth on the other hand is larger than the comet nucleus during this closer approach, the Earth would win the tug of war between the shroud material and we would witness a severe pollution event, which would include more oil, water and other chemicals."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"24 The final and most severe Earth Changes would occur if the intruder passed close enough to Earth to cause gravitational effects. There has been a tremendous amount of incorrect information propagated on the Internet stating that magnetic fields would couple and cause a pole shift. This is clearly NASA misinformation being disseminated through the web site of the cult \"Leader\" who claims to receive the information from aliens. The truth of the matter is that the magnetic fields do not work in this way (for a more complete discussion of the causes of pole shifts, read this in the text Planet X Comets and Earth chant&). The real cause of the physical pole shift is caused when a large gravitational \"wave\" or impulse passes through the mantle of Earth and basically jerks it around the core beneath. The physical pole shift (as opposed to a magnetic pole shift) is where the north rotational pole of Earth is shifted southward and a previous southern area becomes the new north rotational pole. The south rotational pole is likewise shifted. In a previous pole shift, the old north pole was somewhere just north of the state of Wisconsin while the old south pole was in what we now call the south Indian Ocean. The shift moved the tropical area of Siberia northwards in a matter of hours, flash-freezing entire herds of tropical mastodons and wooly mammoths in their tracks while they were still standing on all four feet. Today we are discovering them thousands of years later with the meat as fresh as the day it froze. Tropical plants including delicate flowers were found undigested in the throats of these animals. The south pole, what we call the continent of Antarctica today, was in a more temperate climate at the time and also had wooly mammoths. It is believed to have had a large human population that were likewise flash-frozen and are still trapped under the 2 mile thick Antarctic ice cap along with their temple cities. This by the way is the cause of much secret research by the US government at the South Pole. Also today we know there is an dozen lake (Lake Vostok) that exists nearly two miles under the south polar ice cap and is nearly the size of Lake Superior (the largest freshwater lake on Earth). If the south pole had been there for millions of years as NASA claims, then there could not be such a situation. The Antarctic ice cap is literally sliding off the land into the ocean since the land is still warm from just a few thousand years ago in its more temperate climate. 25 During a mantle shift caused by gravitational impulse of the passing large comet nucleus, tremendous earthquakes develop and the Earth is recovering from these and adjusting for centuries to come. Volcanoes will become active and new fissures in the Earth's surface will bring fourth new volcanoes where none existed previously. There is a second type of gravitational wave pole shift I call the \"precession\" pole shift. It is induced as Earth's spinning core precesses in the gravitational field of a near by passing large comet nucleus and is illustrated later in the text. The Earth's mantle rides over the core in a separate type of pole sM, and may move in a totally different direction. The physics of this process is beyond the scope of this book. We all remember the tales of Atlantis and other continents that were devastated and drawn under the ocean in a single night of catastrophic flooding and Earth Changes. The Egyptian priest cults were very clear when they relayed to the early Greek cultures that it was such a cosmic catastrophe that took Atlantis under. Mountain ranges were formed and areas that were previously under the oceans were thrust up thousands of feet. All of this took place in a terrible night of calamity and destruction caused by a passing large comet. Modern science attempts to try and explain this away with ridiculous ploys, but the populace is far smarter than the Ph.D.s think. For a complete and unabridged discussion of this as seen through the eyes of the ancients, if you have time after preparing for the upcoming events, read the 3 books by Irnrnanuel Velikovsky entitled Worlds in Collision, Earth in Upheaval and Ages in Chaos. Velikovsky was one of the truly great scholars of the 20~ century. He was ridiculed literally to death by the standard scientific community. As my theoretical work now proves, it was standard science that was wrong and Velikovsky who was right. But since egos still rule in the scientific communities of academia, in the United States at least, you will never see these scientists break rank even as the Destroyer approaches and is seen through the expensive telescopes paid for by your tax dollars. Thanks again NASA! Even if NASA announces Planet X now it will be more than obvious that thev are onlv doing it because the public k just about to find it out anvwav, and thev onlv want to control the press."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The 12 Month Period Prior to \"Passage\" This chapter is meant to shock people into the realization that you must prepare now, and unfortunately with little predicted information regarding the true nature and severity of an impending passage. At 12 months prior to the passage there will be little concrete information and in the United States especially there will be no disclosures of the impending situation. However, waiting is a mistake since as time goes on, supplies will be in short supply and it will be diflicult or impossible to make preparations even months in advance. As already mentioned the preparation will require not only preparing stores of goods to weather the situation, but it will require people to be settled in their new surroundings with a complete life style change that has no dependencies on standard utilities or intkastructure of society. Those that make the break early will have the greatest chance of survival. Those that wait to the last minute will be left unable to cope with all that will have to be done. The stress levels will be severe in the worst case scenario, so being in the new surroundings and already adjusted will be of utmost importance. The economic structures do not want to see people moving in this direction since a good deal of money is made by having people locked into dependency on the utilities and intiastructures of modem society. But before, during and aRer a passage, there will not be any use for any of these, as they will be rendered useless as the time of passage approaches. At approximately 3 years to 12 months prior to passage the large \"intruder\" planet will enter the far reaches of our solar system and ignite into a huge comet, along with all of its companion bodies that are orbiting it as the moons of Jupiter orbit that large planet within our solar system. At this point the \"Planet X object is discharging the huge electrical capacitor that surrounds the Sun. Planet X and its companions would all become huge comets in a swirling cluster. These are dragging in the tail material and becoming larger as they move into the solar system. The Sun begins to react yet no one can see the huge monster except for NASA telescopes which had been tracking the objects for 27 years as they approached. NASA computers had already calculated the orbits of each object and they have reported their findings to the NSA and CIA. But the \"lawless one\" moves erratically. The Destroyer is headed for a near collision with Earth and they estimate the devastation. Their decision to keep the information &om the public was made long ago with internal decisions designed to prevent a public panic. These scientists now realize that their theories of solar system formation (that all the planets formed 4.5 billion years ago) and for the workings of comets (the so called \"dirty snowball comet model\") are incorrect as this massive hot steaming planet has just become a comet and is proceeding into the solar system to become a new planet. Immanuel Velikovsky was right about all ofthis and they were wrong. They keep this secret from the public (under the guise of \"National Security\") and of course also to save face. NASA scientists, the NSA, CIA and top level people in the government begin making plans to build cave cities to save themselves and their loved ones. News leaks out to top Corporate CEOs and executives who had contributed heavily to past political campaigns and these executives begin raiding corporate hds and retirement accounts to pay for their space in the expensive cave tunnel systems. They all know there will never be any repercussions since there is not enough time left for the justice system to work. The caves are stocked for an expected stay of 50 years. The public is totally unaware of their impending doom. The CIA creates a misinformation campaign so that when the inevitable story does hit the public eye, they can dispel the truth it in the press. These agencies select an agent to take the role of a elderly lady who moves to the country in the Midwest and claims to talk to aliens about Planet X. The plan is that when the public becomes aware, there would be a staged mass suicide of crazy people who were meeting to \"transform their bodies into semi-alien beings\". The news would point to the sky where the \"Leader\" of the cult group was claiming the aliens and Planet X were arriving and show that nothing was there. This would be the public's first information regarding the topic of Planet X. The equation . . . crazy alien cult = Planet X. Some independent scientists, however, notice the unusual solar activity and report this to the public as best as they can. But the news"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"2 8 media initiates a negative article campaign to negate the flurry of public interest. As the comet approaches the inner solar system the public begins to notice the Earth Changes listed in the previous chapter. One by one they become convinced that something is terribly wrong and that the government has been fully aware of the impending situation for possibly as much as a decade or more. In this time the public could have prepared and made provisions, but now there is little time left and the public has no where to turn for information as the government paid scientists are all well shielded fiom them. The only source of information comes fiom a handful if independent researchers who are risking their lives by going public and trying to provide information with little or no astronomical equipment and without access to the store houses of information guarded in the secure vaults of NASA. At 8 months prior to passage the weather starts to become erratic and solar flares pound the Earth. All of this is reported to the public by the independent scientists, as NASA and NOM (the national weather service) pretend that everything is \"normal\". The Earth Changes are blamed on a fictitious culprit called \"el Nino\", a mythical weather pattern that supposedly causes all sorts of worldwide effects. Eventually the public realizes this cannot be the cause of all these amazing results, especially the severe flaring fiom the Sun. Already the insurance industry is near bankruptcy due to the past years of paying claims for severe weather that NOM is still trying to pass off as \"normal\". Housing insurance doubles, then triples, then doubles again. The insurance industry blames it on the stock market and people begin to lose their homes as the cost of the banking industry enforced insurance on mortgaged homes forces monthly mortgage payments to double due to the insurance costs. In spite of the high cost of insurance, the insurance companies stop paying claims as they run out of money. The rest of the economy fails but the public is still unaware that this is a direct result of the approach of the huge comet with Planet X as its nucleus. At four months before passage the weather becomes more erratic and remote areas of the world begin to be cut off fiom fuel for heating and other essentials. The developed countries have failing economies and the only talk in the halls of government is the need for war. The \"Passage\" We know fiom texts left by the ancients that the last \"event\" was a total surprise to the people of Earth. It is apparent that some people were warned and fled to caves or built unusual boats to store all that would survive. The massive comet came fiom behind the Sun and within days the Earth was engulfed in the huge comet tail and the close passage was underway. They had 40 days and 40 nights of rain (water fiom the huge comet tail) and there was a complete set of Earth Changes that went with that event. The population of Earth was reduced to a fiaction of its original size and the rotational poles were shifted approximately 30 degrees or more. Tropical animals were flash-fiozen over night with fiesh grasses in their mouths, while entire continents submerged or emerged fiom the seas. The few that survived passed on the legends by word of mouth while others wrote of the event on papyrus scrolls and hid them in caves in hopes that someone would fmd them sometime in the distant future. Modem science has done everything possible to try to dispel this information, and have given more than ridiculous excuses for why we found the world in its current state. \"Plate tectonics\" has been offered as an explanation for why hundreds of thousands of mastodons were flash fiozen in the Siberian tundra, but tectonics move Earth's plates at the rate of about a centimeter per year, so the animals would have rotted in a few days . . . and they are expecting us to believe that they stood there for centuries while the ice slowly piled up around them?! Not even the most nake grade-schooler would believe this story! Few people can imagine the tremendous forces at work during a close passage of a large comet. The gravitational wave is sufficient to move waves of land and rock at speeds in excess of a thousand miles per hour across the land. It can take deposited sandstone layers fiom the depths of the ocean and cast them 15,000 feet upwards as new mountain ranges form. Entire continents are altered and the northern polar caps move and begin to melt as new ones form at the new locations of the north and south rotational poles. As with any catastrophe, it is any wonder that anyone survived. We know that during the last event fully 75 % of all animal species on"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"30 Earth went extinct. Man did survive. Creatures in the oceans survived with better odds. There is one thing that is certain, these events have happened in the past and they will happen again in the future. They are survivable and with preparations, the survival rate will be much higher. Without preparations, man as a species, could reach extinction. What a just desert for a species that spent all of its time and resources fighting petty wars for greed and oil . . . instead of using those resources to prepare its public for the one event that would cost them their very existance. Two diagrams (page 34 & 35) are included at this point to illustrate the severity and complicated nature of the pole shift. This is introduced at this point to prepare the reader for the chapters on calendars. This pamphlet is being written with the minimal amount of detail and complexity so that the average person will be able to accomplish the most important work described here . . . that is, the re- calendaring of the area when you end up after a rotational pole shift. The diagrams show a before and after scenario of a hypothetical case of a Planet X passage to illustrate the results of the two types of pole shift. 1 will reiterate here, this is not related here to a \"magnetic pole sM\" as is incorrectly stated by some and the distinction is detailed in the text Planet X Comets and Earth Changes. I want to stress that this is just a hypothetical example and the dates, times, after positions etc., are strictly for illustration only. The view is fiom just up and beyond Earth as it orbits the Sun on an arbitrarily determined date of January 10 in a hypothetical year 20XX. It is 03:OO PM local standard time (21:OO Universal Time) for a person living in Minneapolis Minnesota at approximately 44 degrees north latitude and 93 degrees west longitude. His local horizon plane with East West North South and Vertical are marked. The Sun fiom his perspective is low in the afternoon winter sky. His Earth is tilted 23.5 degrees fiom the plane of Earth's orbit (The Ecliptic) and this tilt \"precesses\" like a top every 26,000 years. This causes the seasons to slowly change over that period of time and the North Pole to move to new locations very slowly as the Earth precesses. The north polar axis (the imaginary axis about which Earth spins) points within one degree of the star we call Polaris at the base of the handle of the little dipper constellation. There are 24 hours in every day (high noon to high noon) and the Earth moves in a near circular orbit causing the length 3 1 of the day to remain constant over the duration of the year. There are 365.25 days in the year, so every 4 years the Earth calendar adds one day to account for the one quarter of a day extra that is left over each year. The figure shows the day and night sides of Earth and their locations relative to the person and the North Pole. Lastly, the Moon is 1 in an orbit of approximately 28 days and this orbit is slanted more than 6 degrees fiom the plane of the ecliptic, surely a remnant of a previous encounter with a large comet nucleus of the Earth-Moon system. The lunar orbit is slightly elliptical. The \"after\" state (page 35) in this hypothetical diagram illustrates Earth after the hypothetical encounter with a massive passing celestial comet nucleus \"Planet X object. Note how most of the elements of Earth's position and orbit have changed, which will affect the calendar on both a short and long term basis. The end result is that a person standing on his local horizon will have to rebuild his calendar with no aids other than a pile of rocks on the ground and the knowledge gained in this pamphlet. Without this information, he will plant crops at the wrong time and most probably not survive the first year. The \"after\" diagram shows Earth on January 11,20XX (one day later) after the close encounter with a large comet nucleus. Much has changed. The tilt of the polar axis has changed in two ways. It no longer tilts at 23.5 degrees but is now at a mere 16 degrees causing its long term presession rate to decrease to almost 15,000 years. This is not an immediate concern but illustrates the need to constantly update the calendar as time goes on. The tilt also is no longer pointed at the Polaris star because the large gravitational field of the passing Planet X comet nucleus caused rapid presession of Earth's core and thus altered the seasonal tilt of Earth. Earth is then in the month equivalent to September (the harvest month). Any planting now in the northern climate would not make it to harvest. Only short-term plants growing I in sheltered areas would yield results. The person's latitude has shifted 20 degrees to the south to about 22 degrees north latitude, 1 which is due to the mantle shift. The people living on the same latitude half way around the globe in Russia would have moved 20 degrees closer to the new North Pole. They have been flash fiozen in less than 24 hours and will remain there essentially forever. The person's longitude remains at approximately 90 degrees west of what we used to call the zero or \"prime\" meridian. That designation"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"32 will surely change as the new calendar is formulated in the months and years to come. Remember that due to straining and settling of the Earth after this tremendous shaking, the calendar will continue to make small adjustments for centuries to come. The length of the days have changed to 27 of the old Earth hours (in a real event they may become shorter or longer). This causes the day to nighttime temperature swings to become greater by a number of degrees Fahrenheit every day. This is another consideration for growing crops. It essentially shortens the growing season by 2 weeks on both ends (spring and fall) for latitudes above about 35 degrees. A shorter day would extend the growing season by about that much. As the next year proceeds, the person notices that the length of each day is different. This tells him that the Earth's orbit is now somewhat elliptical compared to before. This is caused by the fact that in an elliptical orbit, Earth now moves faster around the Sun when it is closer to the Sun thanwhen farther away. The lengthoftheday(the time from high noon to the next high noon) is longest when Earth is closest to the Sun since it has to turn farther to reach the next \"high noon\" as Earth moves around the Sun in its orbit. A slight but detectable wobble exists since the old polar ice caps are now askew fiom their original places, but this will subside in a few years as the massive melting of these ice shields occurs. The new polar caps will build quickly at the new polar locations as the incredible heat created by volcanic action and the close passage cause huge clouds to engulf the Earth. Most of this water will cycle quickly to the poles by the natural hydrological cycle of Earth's weather systems. Miles of new ice layered at the poles will pile up quickly. Future geologists will mistake this almost daily layering of ice for \"annual layering\" fiom a longer history than they can understand. The length of the year has been reduced to 350 of the old Earth days due to the new elliptical orbit, but because the new day is now 27 of the old earth hours . . . the new calendar will have 3 11 and one ninth of the new longer days. So when the person realizes this he will have to introduce a \"leap year\" every 9 years now instead of every four years as they had before. The Moon's location in its orbit was advanced by the equivalent of about 2 days and its orbit has been tilted by about 2 degrees more, but due to the distance to the Moon during the encounter, the lunar month 33 remains nearly unchanged fiom the original 28 day cycle. The Moon however is seen through the thick cloud cover of Earth to be a blood red color. Its surface Mares or Seas glow with fiesh molten lava flows. Within a few decades these would cool and turn to black as with any recent lava flows. The extensive cratering that existed just a few days earlier on the lunar surface had been covered with fiesh lava and buried fiom site. Water rivers, which came fiom water flowing in fiom the huge comet tail, would flow temporarily on the Moon's surface, causing erosion markings that would confuse geologists thousands of years later as to their source. This hypothetical example is preparing you to learn about rebuilding the calendar, which is essential for planting and harvesting. It also answers one of the main questions that modern researchers have had regarding the \"stonehedge\" types of calendars found around the world. That is that these sites show the calendar and celestial positions that we know today with the current status of the solar system. The answer of course is that the residents of these areas had to continually adjust their sites as the solar system adjusted and therefore . . . YES what we see today is the last \"version\" that was recorded at these sites. That is, we see the last evolutionary state of the stonehedge type of calendars. Fortunately some ancient cultures kept accurate records throughout a prolonged period such as with the Mayans. What is amazingly interesting about modern science is that they assume that no such change in the calendar could possibly have taken place. They assume that the Mayan priests, who designed more accurate calendars that anything modern science has designed today, did not know what they were doing and so the modern scientists remove data points fiom the ancient clay tablets that do not fit the modem contrived dating systems. What is even more bizarre is that modern science refuses to notice that the primary element of the Mayan calendar, as well as the primary deity in their \"religion\", was the god Quetzalcoatl (Venus). The Mayan Calendar clearly tracks the lawless wanderings of the Comet (pre-planet) Venus as it ravaged the Earth on two separate occasions approximately 57 years apart, and eventually nestled into the orbit where we see it today, due to the comet \"tail drag\"."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"The 12 Month Period after \"Passage\" The previous chapters must be put together regarding Earth Changes and the Pole Shift for the reader to get a basic grasp of the severity of the problem, that is, the full suite of disastrous effects must be added to the pole shifts just described. The fact that \"modem science\" does not recognize what they are looking at confounds the situation since no government assistance could ever be secured to protect and prepare the public fiom disaster, since government supported scientists and their enslaved news media would insist that any such preparations would be ridiculous. This is further complicated by the fact that the \"leaders\" are taking all the assets and spending it to lavishly prepare for themselves only. If people survive the passage, the situation will be critical especially during the first few months. It is during this time that food fiom storage locations will possibly be the only thing available. The worst case scenario states that every wall will fall during the passage. That is, nothing will be lefi standing including buildings, trees etc. The earthquakes will continue as well as volcanic eruptions, the influx of water fiom outside the planet and the ever present streaming of meteors into the atmosphere. The level of pollution will be beyond any ability to clean it up and fiesh drinking water will be unavailable. Ifiastructure will be completely gone and items like sewage will be major problems. Simple items like shoes or foot covering will be unavailable and in a single fell swoop, the people and society that remain will have only what is around them to use for whatever they require. You will be limited to movement in only the near vicinity. The ancients spoke of the bubbling waters that were boiling due to lava flows and open vents at the Earth's surface. For a full treatment of these topics fiom the original master in this field of research, the reader is encouraged to read the three texts of Irnrnanuel Velikovsky mentioned on page 25. It also describes what the ancients went through first hand under the most distressing situations man has ever faced in recent history. It is in the first months that a new calendar must be established, the planting cycle started and the rationing of available goods initiated. The Long Term Effects The biggest problem after the passage will be the continual cloudy sky that will prevent performance of the tasks required for survival. The landslides both on the new land formations and under the ocean will make settling into an area dacult. The ancients talk about the groaning Earth for decades and even centuries after the last event. It is my belief that we are not experiencing global warming, but the Earth in many ways is just getting back to \"normal\". The glaciers were lefi by the last event and they are melting according to a complex warming pattern. At first the solar light is reflected off of the glacial ice packs and warming proceeds slowly. As the glaciers flow and begin to melt an exponential warming occurs and we see an ever-increasing amount of sunlight being absorbed which further increases the warming. This continues until the mean temperature levels off as the Earth returns to \"normal\". Many other factors are settling out also. The volcanic activity subsides, the earthquakes are reduced and the cloud cover returns to normal for a water planet at our distance fiom the Sun. Velikovsky, a trained Psychologist, proposed that man as a culture and species developed what he termed \"collective amnesia\". This is not too hard to realize as we see this happen all the time in modern society. Even Presidents just can't remember sometimes when things get to difficult to admit to the rest of us. Corporations forget Billions of dollars in accounting and just cannot remember where it went. So it was with the ancients. Today modern science has swallowed the denial pill and is in a constant state of collective amnesia concerning the devastated state of the Planet Earth just a few short millennia ago. The ancients also had to deal with the fact that Venus, the large comet, was cycling almost once per year at first and later at a lesser but regular rate, near Earth as a huge comet and they were blasted every time with flooding, electrical discharges and meteor streams. That is why all of the ancient calendar structures, fiom central and south America to Zimbabwe ALL TRACKED VENUS. Likewise, we would have to track any new comets that would enter the solar system."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"What to Do \"It is not the strongest oj'the spec:ies that survives, nor the most intelligenk It is the one that is most adaptable to change.\" . . . . . . Charles Darwin The rest of this text will become more direct and detailed regarding what to do and how to prepare for survival based on the new understanding of what the \"passage\" leally is all about. Remember that even the best-laid plans may all be blown in the wind or washed away in a flood leaving you with nothing more than your instincts and abilities gained in previous experiences although nothing you have ever experienced will be anything llke what is about to take place. It has already been stated that the sooner one takes his family and completely sheds the support of modern qociety, the better your chances of survival will be. They are not kidding when in the Bible they say \". . . and the meek shall inherit the Earth.\" The societies that have always lived with the least resources. will be best prepared to survive. The societies have lavished theinselves with the use of the most resources will have the least chance to survive \" . . .The first shall be last the last shaU be first.\" Those that have depended on medical shots to prevent disease will be the most susceptible to disease. Those who have had the best diet and grown the largest will be hardest hit by a severely limited diet. I'hose who have become totally dependent on the infrastructure of modern society will be least able to cope without them. So do not ask the question oi'\"when will Planet X arrive\". If you have been reading this book, you will understand that this is an irrelevant question. 'That is why the government misinformation campaign is designed around giving you false information. Because they can then point to it to make you think that you should not pay attention to all of that \"crazy planet X stuff\". 'The reality is that they are really trying to prevent a mass movement away fiom their resource control, monetary control, and utility control that is keeping the populous enslaved with them as fearless leaders. That is why they try to convince you that you have to sacrifice the youth in their holy wars. 39 So the answer to the question of what to do should already becoming answered in your mind. The first step is to decide that society as it now stands is not for you and that you want your ofipring and future generations to know that you turned the course of history and laid a firm foundation for their futures also. The introduction of Planet X types of objects will be here for everyone to deal with both now and in the future. After malung the immediate future plans to deal with these events, a longer-term strategy must be put into place and for even larger groups of society. Once this is accomplished and possibly at this same time, those who are interested must become a space faring society with the ability to go into space and live and survive there. The current NASA space program is designed to keep the general populous out of space and make it seem like it is soooooo difficult and dangerous that only they can get there. If NASA did its job and made outer space easily accessible, then they would in essence put themselves out of business since we would no longer need NASA to get there. Also they are harboring the inside information regarding the resources of outer space such as which asteroids hold the largest deposits of precious metals. This assures that you will not get them, but they will first be secured by the same group that now controls the resources on Earth. It is the last frontier. Who ever gets there fist will possibly own the greatest prize in the history of mankind. But space is a required territory for the wider scale population and ultimate survival of the species. There is a myth that a few humans will be able to repopulate the Earth in times of disaster. The gene pool will be too small for ultimate survival of the species we call homo sapiens. Are we really \"intelligent man\"? If we do not remove the control groups fiom society that have won the final game of monopoly, then we are guiltier than they are for allowing the demise of the human race and the beautifid water planet we call Earth. The answer to the question of what to do before the passage should now be obvious. What you do during the passage will be your decision also. Survival structures and supplies to help you through the tribulation may help and save your lives. One NASA scientist has built a reinforced cement dome house and buried it under 50 feet of compacted dirt in the Arizona desert. This information comes fiom the dome manufacturer that built it under contract. This may be a safe"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"40 place for some Earth Change effects, but for flooding or washing of new dirt onto this area, it could provide him and his family with nothing more than an elaborate grave. There is an ocean going luxury ship called \"The Arc\" that has sold berths to wealthy business men who have gotten inside information fkom their government fkiends that Planet X is approaching. It is provisioned for an extended stay for years (even decades) at sea. This may be the next untold story of the Titanic. The governments of the world have built extensive cave cities using nuclear powered tunneling machines that leave a glass liner as the heat of the nuclear reactor motor melts the shell of the cave as the tunneling machine passes through. These are likewise provisioned with 5 0 years of food, medical supplies and every sort of amenity that we live with today. Some are under minor mountain ranges while others are burrowed into the sides of massive granite mountains. These caves will actually be the worst place to be since the gravitational waves will turn these man-made caverns into fkactured underground death chambers. The best preparations would be for near surface reinforced cement domed shelters with no windows and doors on the dome areas of the structure. The entrances should be like prairie tornado shelters that enter fkom under ground. Other secure shelters are being built fkom solid metal tubing and outfitted with access tubes and buried under ground. These should be placed in areas where water drains away fkom the structure and is not susceptible to mud slides. One of the most valuable materials after a passage in my estimation, and also most probably the most dficult to find, will be glass. As will be mentioned in the last chapter on planting, the isolation of a growing area in a sealed greenhouse will be one of the most important aids in growing plants. There are many reasons for saying this. The most important is that plants will need controlled environments. One of the least stable elements for a long time to come will be the environment. Dust fkom distant volcanoes, oils fkom above, polluted water and more will be everywhere. The greenhouse will seal out the unwanted environment and control the planting area if for nothing more than starting new plants when they are small. Even a small plant starting \"hot house\" will be essential. 4 1 Seeds that will regenerate (non-hybrids) will be most difficult to find and there is the additional problem that has recently been recognized by seed saving specialist . . . that even old varieties of seeds will cross pollinate with modem hybrid plant pollen. This renders the seeds of these plants to be as impotent as the hybrids. So one should have seeds stored for many years of planting, since the first years may possibly produce no seed until all of the hybrid plant species have died off and their pollen gone away. Once again thanks to modern science, man's survival is made much more difficult. The emergence of metallurgy, glass making, pottery making, spinning and weaving of raw fibers into materials, the making of rope, woodworking methods, the maintenance of fire sources, the design of sharp implements fiom natural glass, the creation of tools fkom bone - stone and horns of animals, the extraction of fuels fkom the ground such as coal and oil, the invention of carts and roads for increased mobility, the use natural materials for clothing and foot coverings . . . the list can go on and on. Are you ready for a Planet X passage? Is your community prepared for a passage that may occur next spring, next year or in a decade? I suspect that the answer for the vast majority of people is NO! Now can you imagine trying to move into a new area with no essential materials or previously gained skills and, even without a passage situation, make an attempt at survival based on just the resources you would find around you? Could you and the people you know, attempt a rapid migration of 1000 miles under adverse conditions . . . and be sure what direction to move with your chosen group of people . . . ifa pole shift lands you at a farther northern location? Has your space program provided society with a wide scale program of access to outer space and developed easily accessible large space stations in which large groups of people can remain self- sustaining for a long duration? Or have they squandered the money allotted and made millionaires out of many people who fed at the government trough while the true purpose of the space agency went unfblfilled? Has this agency recognized the severe electrical nature of outer space and listened to those who have fkeely contributed space craft designs that could endure the electrical currents that will flow through Earth's vicinity when a large comet passes near? Has your society built for the future or squandered its resources fighting wars?"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The Pre-Passage Earth Calendar Re-Calendaring and Survival How to View the Sky - Building a modern Stone Hedge Know the Stars and Planets - The Difficulties How All of This Could Change - Planting 1 Harvesting A series of diagrams have been designed specifically for this text. There are many ways to depict the sky for different purposes. My past teaching of the very complex topic of astronomy to university and college students as well as my lectures to the more general public has taught me something. First of all, anyone can understand if material is presented in a manner they can understand. Secondly, it is up to the teacher to find that connection rather that the teacher expecting everyone to see things as he sees them with his greater experience. The diagrams are designed so that a person standing on the ground and looking at the Earth and sky around him can visualize and see the sky as it looks fiom that vantage point, that is standing on the ground watching the sky move overhead as the night progresses. All of the diagrams are for a person in the northern hemisphere. If one is south of the equator, then the motion of the night sky will be opposite (e.g. when the text says to locate the northern polar direction you would find the southern polar direction, east would be to the opposite side depicted, etc.). Do not use a magnetic compass as after a pole shift the surface magnetic fields as well as the ionosphere electrical currents will render the magnetic compass useless. It may not even point in the same direction at a given location as it did before a pole shift. Items that will be of use after a pole shift wdl be a method of recording information that will last. The ancients used clay tablets or etchings on stone. A clock is important but one would need a clock that is not operated with a battery that will expire, although it may be useful for the year or so (it would operate to give information on the length of the new day, year, etc). A very valuable aid would be a star chart that would give the stars around the Ecliptic Plane as this will remain much the same (the plane of the planets as they move through the seasons of the year). 43 Two good sources for star charts that will help in understanding this are the following. \"Peterson Field Guide to the Stars and Planets\" (available in book stores) which is printed on water proof plastic pages and contains star charts for the entire sky. Another is called \"The Astronomical Calendar\" and is available on the internet. The Astronomical Calendar has excellent diagrams and charts which might further clarlrqr the reasoning behind what you are doing in this pamphlet (although it does not talk about the process of rebuilding a calendar). Look at the first diagram on page 44. This page is left blank so you can use graph paper and build your own full size version (8 %\" by 11\") and put it in plastic for use outside (local copy businesses will do this for a minimal fee). Page 44 shows the view of the horizon for a person standing on the ground in the northern hemisphere and looking south. If you turn 90 degrees to your right you will be facing west, and 90 degrees to the left you will be facing east. The next page is for the same person looking north from the same location. Now east is 90 degrees to your right and west is 90 degrees to your left. The idea of these charts is that you will be looking at the stars, planets and the Sun as they rise into the sky. The most important aspect of rebuilding a calendar is locating along the horizon the rising and setting points of celestial bodies. So this is made to be flat on the diagram. As you would go vertically up from the horizon from any point between east and west, you would end up at your local vertical point which is also seen as a line, but since the vertical is less important in the calendar rebuilding process this will not be a problem. The idea is that you will be facing a given direction and your work will be along your local horizon. The rest of this text will follow a cookbook approach to building a stonehedge calendar. You will begin to appreciate what the ancients did and it will make some other interesting aspects of archaeology apparent. It will first build the calendar we have today to give you some experience, then give an example of how things might change and you will then have to wait for the next Planet X passage to prepare your next calendar. The first step is to create a true horizon in 360 degrees that is level to the gravitational field of Earth using a water level."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"46 A carpenter's level is based on gravity and the fact that water is a fluid and it reaches its own level. A bowl or crude container holding water with a flat stick floating in it can also be used as a level. The object is to define the most level horizon in all directions fiom your viewing station as possible. Do not estimate level as this can fool you. Also, after a devastating earth movement things that used to be level may not be level any more, so a new level must always be taken. Ancient archaeological sites used various horizons, with some being natural while others were man made. The larger the area used . . . the more accurate wdl be your calendar. Also do not set above (or below) the local horizon on a cliff, tree or other elevated perch. Your eyes must be at the level of your local horizon. Examples of ancient \"observatories\" are 1) the CARAL in Peru in which they built a mound in a circle around a central viewing station on the edge of a ridge overlooking a vast plane with mountains in the distance; 2) Chichen Itza in Yucatan Mexico used the local savanna tree line as its horizon (the observatory was a platform built at the level of the top of the tree line); 3) in Zimbabwe they built a 250 meter diameter stone wall around a central viewing station at the same level as the top of the wall 4) the famous Stone Hedge in England used the vast local horizon with stones to mark the calendar points. If trees are on the other side of a clearing, then you may have to estimate the exact local horizon. A lake gives a good local horizon but usually has hills to one side. You will need vision in all 360 degrees as much as possible. Reread this page many times and follow it exactly as it is here that most mistakes will be made. Now determine true north (or south if your are south of the equator). Use page 45 diagram. There are two ways to determine the true rotational pole location. Set up a viewing station with elevated reference points (a grid or even sticks stuck into the ground) in the direction of what you think is north. Always make your measurements from your designated viewing point in the center of your local horizon. Method # 1 . . . have someone adjust a stick on a moveable stand and as the night progresses center the top of the stick on the area of the sky around which everything else revolves. This will be true north (do NOT use a magnetic compass). The current star Polaris (the \"North Star\") is approximately 1 degree off of true north. Method #2 is illustrated in the diagram on page 47."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"48 The page 47 example shows how the stars and planets at night move around a central area of the sky. The reasons you may need to use this method is 1) cloud cover in the north; 2) there is no star near the north point as there is today; 3) to double check the first method; 4) you can use the Sun and Moon in the daytime sky to establish north so your local horizon is set up when night time comes (caution . . . DO NOT LOOK DIRECTLY AT THE SUN as it will blind you). Track the movement of any star you can see for about an hour and mark the beginning and end points. Take a right angle to that and draw a line (use a string held statioimry or other marking device) into the northern direction. Do this for as many stars or planets as you can. This will be the basis for all of your other measurements and you will want to continually update and refine this measurement. Remember that after a pole shift things may continue to change for some time to come. Keeping a calendar is an ongoing task. Page 47 shows a north polar rotational point that is 54 degrees above the horizon meaning you are at 54 degrees north latitude (it may be time to migrate south). Visually mark the north direction using a plumb bob (weight on a string) to connect the north pole direction with your viewing site marker and have someone put a marking stone out as far as possible on your horizon that you already prepared. Remember to keep your viewing marker level with the local horizon. Mark the north stone so you remember which one it is (since you may have many stones near it if you have to track a meandering comet for future electrical alignment predictions which would bring possible future bad weather, etc). Next go out beyond the north star rock or marker and sight back along the central viewing marker and set the south stone. Mark it also. You will need to use a geometry method to determine east and west directions. You are going to determine a perpendicular bisector of your north south line at the point of your viewing marker. Take a rope that does not stretch (hemp or Dacron but not nylon). From equal distances north and south of your viewing marker (use 50 feet for example) and using a rope 3 to 4 times this length, draw arcs to the east and west of the viewing point and where these arcs intersect will give you due east and due west points. View across your viewing marker and place stones on your local horizon in the east and west directions and mark them clearly so they are not later mistaken for 49 other rocks. If your north direction is refined later, move these points also to adjust for new information. You are now ready to start building your calendar. The purpose is to determine the autumn and spring equinox points and the winter and summer solstices (that's when you have pagan parties). In the old days the ancients depended on the Sun only and this is the most accurate method in the long term, however there is a quick method to build a basic calendar to tell you where you are, based on the rising and setting of the planets and certain stars that are on the Ecliptic (plane of the planets). By laying out a pattern on the ground you can determine what month you are in and then refine these settings later. This book will not explain why you are doing these things, it just teh you what to do. The reality is that you may not have good viewing of the sunrise or sunset on the days you need and if you miss these your calendar would have to wait a year for an update. The problem is that you do not have a year to wait. In fact you may only have a night or two of good viewing between bad weather and other tasks of survival. Gather rocks and mark them for the planets that are visible in the night sky at the time you are working as well as any predetermined stars that are on the Ecliptic that you can identify. DO NOT USE THE MOON FOR MARKING A CALENDAR since the moon has many complex motions and is not suitable for marking the seasons. Note that this process requires preparation and previous knowledge and experience. The more you practice and understand, the better off you will be when the time comes to put this into practice. Note that the positions of the other planets and the stars do not change on the scale of one night and that is all you will use them for. Page 50 shows a diagram that you will build based on the relative positions of the planets and your chosen stars of the Ecliptic for building your calendar. You must mark the angular positions of these objects relative to the Sun on a diagram with the Earth in the center. These angles you will measure as the night proceeds relative to sunrise or sunset. To do this, since the sunrise and sunset twilight will cause all but Venus and possibly Jupiter to fade and dim, you will have to measure the angles relative to those bright objects and calculate the differences or add angles to get their angular positions relative to the Sun. This diagram will be the basis of your calendar."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"5 1 During the course of the night between sunset and sunrise, you d see about two thirds of the entire sky that is visible fiom your latitude and which includes the Ecliptic plane where the constellations of the zodiac pass over head each night. About one thnd of the sky is hidden behind the Sun at any given time and also not visible during twilight when the sky is still light fiom the Sun before sunrise and after sunset. But there is enough of the sky to determine a basic calendar fiom a single night of good viewing. This will need constant updating and refinement as the years go on. The diagram on page 50 is built as follows. As the Sun sets and the stars become visible along the Ecliptic, use Venus or Jupiter to make an initial reading of their angles with respect to the Sun (remember do not look directly at the Sun). This is best done just at sunset (or sunrise). For best accuracy measure to where you estimate the center of the Sun would be. To measure angles you may build a measuring device or even use your outstretched arm with fist and second finger spread apart (use stars of known angular separation to figure out in your training sessions what angle this will be using your arm and fingers). The ecliptic forms an arc across the sky and all the planets and stars that you will use to build your calendar stand in set positions for the one night of viewing (the planets move but you can ignore this during your one night of viewing for this calendar). The trick that this calendar method uses is that, depending on the angle that the ecliptic star or planet is fiom the Sun, they actually will rise and set at different locations along your horizon relative to east and west. The ones that rise due east and west are in the fall or spring equinox constellations whereas the ones that rise and set either north or south of east and west d fall in the other months of the year. This is why you are building a circle of angles measured relative to the Sun. First you determine which direction (ahead of or behind the Sun) where the spring and fall equinoxes are located and then you will determine the month that the Sun is in right now. It will only be over the course of the year that you will be able to determine how many days there are in the year and other finer points of the new calendar after a pole shift. When the Sun reaches the fall or spring equinox point, it will rise and set in the east and west respectively on that day."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"5 2 The difficulty with building a calendar is that as the seasons progress and the years pass, it is very difficult to \"catch the Sun at exactly the equinox position. So the ancients learned that they had to measure the farthest southern rnovemcnt of the Sun along the horizon as it progressed into winter, to determine the winter solstice . . . and then likewise during summer they watched the Sun rise and set along the horizon to its northernmost rising and setting points to determine the summer solstice. It was only by bisecting these two points that they were able to determine an accurate day for the equinoxes (or beginning and ending oft he planting seasons). Rut there is a problem. If you wait until the summer solstice to determine a calendar then you already missed the growing season. So that is why I have devised this method of determining an cntire ]ear calendar on a single night of viewing. Even though this is not the most accurate method, it will give a calendar for immediate use. Page 53 shows an example of the sky as might be currently seen with Earth as it is now (before the next pole shift). Practice with this to see how many stars on the Ecliptic you can identlfy for your own personal use as well as to identlfy the planets currently visible. Watch each rise and set and see that they in fact rise and set north and south of east and west depending on their angle relative to the location of the Sun. Determine which stars are in the fall months and which are in the spring months and see how accurate your calculations give for the exact date of the year. Could you plant a garden by your calendar? What if the Earth had days of different length throughout the year . . . how would you determine this? If you used a time piece set to 24 hours, how would you expect this to change as the 4 year leap year approached. These are all questions that you may try to answer as you develop your understanding of how the sky works and the complex motions that change throughout the year. If the length of the day were to change, how would you use your time piece to measure this'? Can you imag~ne a purely mechanical clock? Can you imagine the 2 types of pole shifis described in this book and what effects it might have on your calendar. Can you view on a partly cloudy night with the clouds moving over and determine the direction of north. Can you imagine a better set up for your local horizon and rock marking system. How would you predict solar alignments with Venus and Mars and a wandering comet? This can become very complex quickIy."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"5 7 So now that you have seen the circular calendar wheel and its related sky chart and angle measuring chart of the sky, it is time to put more detail into the process. In review, the process involves first setting up your local viewing area with the level \"horizon\" field of view. This must be 360 degrees all around you and the larger . . . the better. Making the viewing area in itself can be a small engineering task and the ancients went to great lengths to make these as detailed and large as possible. Accuracy is of the utmost importance. The viewing location must be a stationary point that your eye moves around to look in all directions including up and around at the sky. The ideal situation is to have moveable markers or some type of angle measuring device that is stationary. There are many ways to create these and this is not a topic of this book. There is an entire field of study related to the construction of measuring devices, but the simple extended arm with spread first two fingers may be the best you may have as mentioned earlier until you have time to refine your setup. Locate north, then define south, then east and west and mark them. Are you too far north to support an agricultural life style? If so you may want to migrate or else depend on animals as a primary source of everything you need. Many cultures took this route and succeeded. As sunset arrives, begin to locate the setting Sun location on the horizon. Is it north of east or south? Are the setting and rising points on the horizon moving in a northerly or southerly direction as the days progress? This may be your first indication that you are heading into a particular season or towards a solstice or equinox point. Can you identifl planets or specific stars that you know are on the Ecliptic Plane? If so start to measure the angles between them and their relative angles with respect to the Sun. Design your calendar circle and mark the angles between each and the Sun. Determine which one rises and sets the closest to due east and due west. Measure off to the Sun and see diagram of page 53 to determine the season that the Sun is in at the current time. Are you going to plant long term crops or depend on stored goods for a winter before planting? Remember to mark your setting and rising stones for each star or planet that rises and sets and mark them. If you have a watch from the old calendar before the pole shift, try to determine the length of the day and compare to the value you measured before the pole shift. Is the day longer or shorter between high noon and high noon."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"58 The best way to measure high noon is with a vertical stick or rod located on your north south line and a mark set at due north. The time from when the shadow crosses the north line to the next time is one day, however, as mentioned previously . . . if the Earth has moved to a more elliptical orbit the day lengths will have changed. The shortest days will occur when the Earth is farthest from the Sun and the longer days will occur when Earth is closest to the Sun. Do these days correspond with any other dates such as solstices or equinox points? They do not necessarily have to but it should be on the same date every year (only the planet Mercury is known to have its elliptical orbit precess over time, something astronomers still debate). Your calendar should be adjusted as the months and years pass. Remember the adjustments mentioned earlier relative to a pole shift. If the intruding comet continues to cycle around the Sun, there will be patterns that will be noticeable as to close approaches. But this is what drove the ancients literally crazy, as the comets became known as \"the lawless ones\". They failed to obey the regular rhythms of the cosmos as the other planets, the Sun and the Moon. The big comet orbits changed constantly and even the rates of change were unpredictable. Modern large comets like Hale Bopp did the same thing and this totally baffled modern astronomers. My theoretical work explains this as due to the variable drag of the comet tail as it is drawn into the ever growing comet nucleus. The alignments of the inner planets, our Moon and the Sun are known to be times when rough weather are bound to occur. With the addition of a large raging comet in the alignment there is certain to be severe weather, high winds, flooding, and possibly meteor streams which might include rocks big enough to reach the ground before burning up in the atmosphere. Planting and harvesting times are dependent of many factors. If the Earth lost days or weeks worth of daily sunlight, then we could be cast into a mini ice age in which the northern climates would be totally uninhabitable and even the temperate of equatorial climates might have shortened growing seasons. There are no simple answers and the list of possibilities is nearly endless. It is known that the dinosaurs existed for millions of years in a very tropical climate. It appears that this is the normal climate of Earth and that we are just now beginning to warm up to \"normal\" (e.g. there is no greenhouse warming). Mass Migrations If after a pole shift you first measure the latitude and determine that you are more than 45 degrees north latitude and there is has been a long period of loss of sunlight due to cloud cover, then you will have to decide if a rapid mass migration may be required. This would be the most difficult situation for a large group of people, but remaining at a high latitude for any length of time would be near impossible. This is also will be one of the main difficulties with the elite who have stocked cave cities for a long stay, eventually they will also be left with the same conditions as everyone else, only they will be in worse shape to make any kind of move after spending even a number of weeks in a cave, let alone a number of months or years. They will emerge not knowing where at all they are and will have to rebuild the calendar and begin rebuilding a survival existence. Those that started immediately or prepared far earlier will have had the best chance of survival for the long term. Short term survival is just the first step to long term survival. In the scenario of a forced mass migration, you will not be able to bring very much with you, so all of your stored goods may be for naught. The two possible methods of moving people will be over land and over water. Each has its set of perils. For every degree of latitude that you are above 45 degrees, you will have to move southwards about 70 miles. This is using the assumption that the earth is slanted at about the same 23.5 degrees from the plane of the planets. If it has tilted more, then you may have to move farther. Since it is unlikely that the tilt angle will change by very much except in only the most severe precessional pole shifts, the number of 70 miles south for every degree above 45 degrees north latitude can be used as a number. As you can see there are many complex factors and one would need a very solid understanding of astronomy and the stars to rebuild all aspects of the new calendar. That is why the \"priests\" of the ancient cultures were so highly regarded . . . because the existence of the entire society literally depended on their knowledge and daily work. One last word about migrations is that in history migrating people have not faked well, so the decision would be a difficult one to make."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"60 Will Man Survive? The rules of nature are quite simple, and in the case of survival as an intelligent species (one that is capable of altering and controlling its environment) the rule of ultimate survival is clear and very simple. As a species . .. collectively . . . ifyou do not use the time and resources allotted to you to gain access to outer space and gain the knowledge to survive . . . you will be doomed to extinction. This clearly leads to some secondary basic rules of nature regarding the use of time and resources. Petty wars and the use of resources to fight these wars can have only one possible result . . . and nature in its own time and manner will repay those species . . . collectively . . . who fail to control their leaders who promote these wars. If there is a smaller group that attempts to use the resources of the many to save their own few and selective hides . . . these especially will be doomed to die a most lonesome and hideous demke. The successful species that eventually will populate the stars will not allow those \"unsuccessful\" species to enter their hard-earned space and bring their petty wars and selfrsh ways into the cosmos. This is called the \"rule of survival of the successful\" ... and is universally understood and commissioned to be executed upon those who fail at the first three rules. These rules are stated to be inherent and self-evident. As a species we have failed. There are no less that 54 wars ongoing at the time of this w-riting. World leaders are out of control. As an observer of the Sun and comets, and a person with inside contacts to very high levels of the intelligence agencies, I will say that the ~iting has been on the wall for some time and there is little doubt that the leaders in these intelligence communities have been warned. Let the reader decide . . . based on the inherent rules of survival . . . will man survive?"}]
