This subject is inherently overwhelm ing as it touches on broad and profound im plications for the future of m ankind on our planet from both an intellectual and a tec hnological perspective. We have provided recom mended actions for different stakeholders (including the press, the public, congress, the military , the scientific establishm ent, the preside nt of the US, and the m embers of the UFO/ET control groups). These recom mendations should help sm ooth the disclosure process, m aking this issue the subject of open and inform ed discussi on, both within our governm ent and the public sectors. The background m aterials include the follo wing ty pes of inform ation: 1) Sum maries of video taped testim ony of m ilitary , governm ent and private first-hand witnesses to UFO/ET events. 2) A series of position papers describing the background history , the need and im plications of disclosure and the dangers of continued secrecy . 3) Fourteen m ajor sightings cases with over two dozen m ilitary witnesses, m any with multiple witnesses and supporting governm ent docum ents. 4) A series of 27 quotes from scientists and governm ent witnesses who knew the subject is real. 5) Reviews of two m ajor recent reports by scientific review com mittees on the need for further research into the UF O phenom ena. 6) A high level review of technological issues including zero-point energy , over-unity devices and anti-gravity research. By reading this docum ent, it is hoped that the astute and open-m inded reader will understand that UFOs are real, and m ove on to thoughtfully address the im plications of this reality for our governm ents and people of this planet. 2.0 TO THE READER - How to Use this document Carl Sagan once stated that “ extraordinary claim s require extraordinary evidence .” In the case of the UFO issue this could be clarified with two additional statem ents: “ the development of extraordinary evidence requir es extraordinary attention ”, and “ extraordinary attention is not merely justified, but virtually dem anded by the growing legion of extraordinary observations .” With this in m ind, we suggest the reader use this briefing docum ent as a source book, not a read-through report. First, read the Abstract and Disclosure Im plications (section 3.1) to gain a sense of the overall issues. If y ou (like m any ) have trouble believing our governm ent can not keep a secret (they can) and therefore this can not be true, read Understanding UFO secrecy (3.3) and Unacknowledged (3.4). Then if y ou have not already done so, read or review our Recom mended Actions (4.0) for various stakeholde rs to understand what needs to be done to disclose these issues. If you want to better understand the critical need for disclosure and its im plications in m ore detail, read the rem aining Position Papers in section 5.0. Our experience has shown that when individuals are first presented with this inform ation, it strains their credulity . However, once they ha ve done their own research, they begin to truly grasp the reality and com plexity of these issues. To help y ou get started we have provided several ty pes of evidence. The sum mary of Witness Testim ony (3.8) provides com pelling first- hand evidence, which supports the notion that there are num erous people involved in the UFO issue and its cover up, and that a num ber are willi ng to com e forward with testim ony about their experiences in this field. In addition, a num ber of well-known and well-docum ented UFO cases (6.0) are reviewed, m any which have suppor ting governm ent docum ents included in the Appendix. The Introduction to the Best Availa ble Evidence (6.1) provides sources for obtaining further inform ation. The Quotations section (3.2) cites quotations about the UFO issue from many well known military and governm ent figures “i n the know” since the 1940s. There is also a 4 "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" high level review of zero-point energy , over-unity devices and anti-gravity research (7.0). Finally , sum maries are included of recent US and French UFO studies by scientists, governm ent leaders, and m ilitary people (8.0). Further supporting inform ation will be found in Dr. Greer’s book on the witness testim ony . 1 3.0 DISCLOSURE OVERVIEW 3.1 Disclosure: Implications for the Envi ronment, World Peace, World Poverty and the Human Future A Brief Summa ry Copy right Steven M. Greer, M.D. – March 2001 For most people, the question of whether or not we are alone in the universe is a m ere philosophical musing – som ething of academ ic interest but of no practical im portance. Even evidence that we are currently being visited by non-hum an advanced life form s seem s to m any to be an irrelevancy in a world of global warm ing, crushing poverty and the threat of war. In the face of real challenges to the long-term hum an fu ture, the question of UFOs, extraterrestrials and secret governm ent projects is a m ere sideshow, right? Wrong – catastrophically wrong. The evidence and testim ony presented in th e following pages establishes the following: ¾ That we are indeed being visited by advanced extraterrestrial civilizations and have been for som e tim e; ¾ That this is the m ost classified, com partm ented program within the US and many other countries; ¾ That those projects have, as warned in 1961 by President Eisenhower, escaped legal oversight and control in the US, the UK and elsewhere; ¾ That advanced spacecraft of extraterrestrial or igin, called extraterrestrial vehicles (ETVs) by som e intelligence agencies, have been downe d, retrieved and studied since at least the 1940s and possibly as early as the 1930s; ¾ That significant technological breakthroughs in energy generation and propulsion have resulted from the study of these objects (and from related hum an innovations dating as far back as the tim e of Nicola Tesla) and th at these technologies utilize a new phy sics not requiring the burning of fossil fuels or ionizi ng radiating to generate vast am ounts of energy ; ¾ That classified, above top-secret projects possess fully operational anti-gravity propulsion devices and new energy generation system s that, if declassified and put to peaceful uses, would em power a new hum an civilization without want, poverty or environm ental dam age. Those who doubt these assertions should carefully read the testim ony of dozens of m ilitary and governm ent witnesses whose testim ony clearly establishes these facts. Given the vast and profound im plications of these statem ents, whether one accepts or seriously doubts these assertions, all m ust dem and that congressional hearings be convened to get to the truth of this   1 Greer, Steven M. Disclosure: Military and Government Witnesses Reveal the Greatest Secrets in Modern History. 2001. 5 "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" matter. For nothing less that the hum an future hangs in the balance. Implications for the Environment: We have identified insiders and scientists who can prove, in open Congressional hearings, that we do in fact possess classified energy generation and anti-gravity propulsion system s capable of com pletely and perm anently replacing all form s of currently used energy generation and transportation system s. These devices access the am bient electrom agnetic and so-called zero point energy state to produce vast am ounts of energy without any pollution. Such system s essentially generate energy by tapping into the ever-present quantum vacuum energy state – the baseline energy from which all energy and m atter is fluxing. All m atter and energy is supported by this baseline energy state and it can be tapped through unique electrom agnetic circuits and configurations to generate huge am ounts of energy from space/tim e all around us. These are NOT perpetual m otion m achines nor do they violate the laws of therm ody nam ics – they merely tap an am bient energy field all around us to generate energy . This m eans that such sy stem s do not require fuel to burn or atom s to split or fuse. They do no require central power plants, transm ission lines and the related m ulti-trillion dollar infrastructure required to electrify and power rem ote areas of India, China, Africa and Latin Am erica. These system s are site-specific: they can be set up at any place and generate needed energy . Essentially , this constitutes the definitive solution to the vast m ajority of environm ental problem s facing our world. The environm ental benefits of such a discovery can hardly be overstated, but a brief list include: ¾ The elim ination of oil, coal and gas as sources of energy generation, thus the elim ination of air and water pollution related to the tran sport and use of these fuels. Oil spills, global warm ing, illnesses from air pollution, acid rain etc can and m ust be ended within 10-20 years; ¾ Resource depletion and geo-political tensions arising from com petition for fossil fuel resources will end; ¾ Technologies already exist to scrub m anufacturing effluent to zero or near zero em issions for both air and water – but they use a great deal of energy and thus are considered too costly to fully utilize. Moreover, since they are energy intensive, and our energy sy stem s today create m ost of the air pollution in the world, a point of dim inishing return for the environm ent is reached quickly . That equati on is dram atically changed when industries are able to tap vast am ounts of free energy (there is no fuel to pay for – only the device, which is no m ore costly than other genera tors) and those sy stem s create no pollution; ¾ Energy -intensive recy cling efforts will be able to reach full application since the energy needed to process solid waste will, again, be free and abundant; ¾ Agriculture, which is currently very energy dependent and polluting, can be transform ed to use clean, non-polluting sources of energy ; ¾ Desertification can be reversed and world agriculture em powered by utilizing desalinization plants, that are now very ener gy intensive and expensive, but will becom e cost-efficient once able to use these new, non-polluting energy sy stem s; ¾ Air travel, trucking and inter-city transpor tation sy stem s will be replaced with new energy and propulsion technologies (anti-gravity sy stem s allow for silent above surface movem ent). No pollution will be generated and costs will decrease substantially since the energy expenses will be negligible. Additi onally , m ass transportation in urban areas can utilize these sy stem s to provide silent, efficient intra-city m ovem ent; 6 "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" ¾ Noise pollution from jets, trucks and other m odes of transportation will be elim inated by the use of these silent devices; ¾ Public utilities will not be needed since each hom e, office and factory will have a device to generate whatever energy is needed. This m eans ugly transm ission lines that are subject to storm dam age and power interrup tion will be a thing of the past. Underground gas pipelines, which not infrequently ruptur e or leak and dam age Earth and water resources, will not be needed at all; ¾ Nuclear power plants will be decom missioned and the technologies needed to clean such sites will be available. Classified technologies do exist to neutralize nuclear waste. Utopia? No, because hum an society will al way s be im perfect – but perhaps not as dy sfunctional as it is today . These technologies are real – I have seen them . Anti-gravity is a reality and so is free energy generation. This is not a fantasy or a hoax. Do not believe those who say that this is not possible: they are the intellectual descendants of those who said the Wright brothers would never fly . Current hum an civilization has reached the point of being able to com mit planeticide: the killing of an entire world. We can and we m ust do better. These technologies exist and every single person who is concerned about the envi ronm ent and the hum an future should call for urgent hearings to allow these technologies to be disclosed, declassified and safely applied. Implications for Society and World Poverty: From the above, it is obvious that these technologies that are currently classified would enable hum an civilization to achieve sustainability . Of course, in the near term , we are talking about the greatest social, econom ic and technologi cal revolution in hum an history – bar none. I will not m inim ize the world-encom passing changes th at would inevitably attend such disclosures. Having dealt with this issue for m uch of m y adult life, I am acutely aware of how im mense these changes will be. Aside from the singular realization that hom o-sapiens are not the only – or m ost advanced – creatures in the universe, this disclosure will cau se hum anity to be faced with the greatest risks and opportunities in known history . If we do nothing, our civilization will collapse environm entally , econom ically , geo-politically and so cially . In 10 – 20 y ears, fossil fuel and oil dem and will outstrip supply significantly – and then it is the Mad Max scenario where every one is warring over the last barrel of oil. It is lik ely that this geo-political and social collapse will precede any environm ental catastrophe. The disclosure of these new technologies will give us a new, sustainable civilization. World poverty will be elim inated within our life tim es. With the advent of these new energy and propulsion sy stem s, no place on Earth will need to suffer from want. Even the deserts will bloom ... Once abundant and nearly free energy is ava ilable in im poverished areas for agriculture, transportation, construction, m anufacturing and el ectrification, there is no lim it to what hum anity can achieve. It is ridiculous –obscene even- that m ind-boggling poverty and fam ine exists in the world while we sit on classified technologies that c ould com pletely reverse this situation. So why not release these technologies? Because the soci al, econom ic and geo-political order of the world would be greatly altered. Every deep in sider with whom I have m et has em phasized that this would be the greatest change in known hum an history . The m atter is so highly classified not because it is so silly , but because its im plications are so profound and far reaching. By nature, 7 "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" those who control such projects do not like change . And here we are talking about the biggest econom ic, technological, social and geo-political change in known hum an history . Hence, the status quo is m aintained, even as our civilization hurtles towards oblivion. But by this argum ent, we would have never had the industrial revolution and the Ludites would have reigned suprem e to this day . An international effort to m inim ize disrupti on to the econom y and to ease the transition to this new social and econom ic reality will be needed. We can do this and we m ust. Special interests in certain oil, energy and econom ic sect ors need to be reigned in and at the sam e tim e treated com passionately : Nobody likes to see their power and em pire crum ble. Nations very dependent on the sale of oil and gas will need help diversify ing, stabilizing and transitioning to a new econom ic order. The United States, Europe and Japan will need to adjust to a new geo-political reality as well: As currently poor but populous countries dram ati cally develop technologically and econom ically , they will dem and – and will get – a m eaningful seat at the international table. And this is as it should be. But the international com munity will n eed to put in place safeguards to prevent such potential geo-political rapprochem ent between th e first and third world from devolving into bellicose and disruptive behavior on the part of the newly em powered. The US in particular will need to lead thr ough strength – but avoid the current trend towards dom ination. Leadership and dom ination are not the sam e, and the sooner we learn the difference the better off the world will be. There can be in ternational leadership without dom ination and hegem ony , and the US needs to realize these di stinctions if it is to provide m uch-needed leadership on this issue. These technologies, because they will decentralize power – literally and figuratively – will enable the billions living in m isery and poverty to enter a world of new abundance. And with econom ic and technological developm ent, education will rise and birth rates will fall. It is well known that as societies becom e m ore educated, prosperous and technologi cally advanced – and wom en take an increasingly equal role in society – the birth rate falls and population stabilizes. This is a good thing for world civilization and the future of hum anity . With each village cleanly electrified, agricultu re em powered with clean and free energy and transportation costs lowered, poverty will dram ati cally fall in the world. If we act now, by 2030 we will be able to effectively elim inate all pove rty in the world as we know it today . We only need the courage to accept these ch anges and the wisdom to steer hum anity safely and peacefully into a new tim e. Implications for World Peace and Security: A few y ears ago I was discussing this subject with the form er Chairm an of the Senate Foreign Relations Com mittee, Senator Claiborne Pell. He explained to m e that he had been in Congress since the 1950s but had never been briefed on this subject. I told him that the nature of these black projects has resulted in m ost of our leaders being left out of any decision m aking on this subject, and what a sham e this is. I said, “Senat or Pell, all that tim e y ou were Chairm an of Foreign Relations, y ou were deprived of the opportunity to deal with the ultim ate foreign relations challenge...” and I pointed to the stars above our heads. He said, “ You know Dr. Greer, I am afraid that y ou are right...” 8 "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" It is true that our great diplom ats and wise elders, such as Senator Pell, President Jim my Carter and other international leaders have b een specifically and deliberately prevented from having access to or control over this subject. This is a direct threat to world peace. In the vacuum of secrecy , operations supervised by neither th e people, the people’ s representatives, the UN nor any other legitim ate entity have taken actions that directly threaten world peace. Testim ony , corroborated by m ultiple m ilitary witnesses who do not know each other and who have had no opportunity for collusion, will show that the US and other countries have engaged these ETVs in arm ed attack, in som e cases leading to the downing of these vehicles. As I said to Mrs. Boutros Ghali, wife of the then Secretary General of the UN, if there is even a 10% chance that this is true, then this constitutes the gravest threat to world peace in hum an history Having personally interviewed num erous credible m ilitary and aerospace officials with direct knowledge of such actions, I am certain that we have done this. Why ? Because these unknown vehicles have been in our airspace without our pe rm ission and because we wanted to acquire their technology . Nobody has asserted that there is an actual threat to hum anity from these objects: Obviously , any civilization capable of routine inters tellar travel could term inate our civilization in a nanosecond, if that was their intent. That we are still breathing the free air of Earth is abundant testim ony to the non-hostile nature of these ET civilizations. We have also been inform ed that the so- called Star Wars (or National Missile Defense Sy stem ) effort has really been a cover for black project deploy ment of weapon sy stem s to track, target and destroy ETVs as they approach Earth or enter Earth’ s atm osphere. No less a figure than Wernher Von Braun warned on his deathbed of both the reality and the m adness of such a schem e, apparently to no avail (see the Testim ony of Carol Rosin, form er spokesperson for Wernher Von Braun). Well, unless we change directions we are likely to end up where we are going. With the ty pes of weapons currently in the covert arsenal – weapons m ore fearsom e even than therm onuclear devices – there is no possibility of a survivable conflict. Yet in the darkness of secrecy , actions have been taken on behalf of every hum an that m ay endanger our future. Only a full, honest disclosure will correct this situation. It is not possible for m e to convey in words the urgency of this. For 10 y ears I worked as an em ergency doctor a nd saw how every possible object can be used as a weapon. Every technology , unless guided by wisdom and a desire for that good and peaceful future – the only future possible – will be used fo r conflict. Super-secret projects that answer to no legally constituted body – not the UN, not the US Congress, not the British Parliam ent – m ust not be allowed to continue to act in this way on behalf of hum anity . One of the greatest dangers of extrem e secrecy is that it creates a herm etically sealed, closed system im pervious to the free and open exchange of ideas. In such an environm ent, it is easy to see how grave m istakes can be m ade. For instance, the testim ony here will show that these ETVs becam e very prom inent after we developed the first nuclear weapons – and began to go into space. There were m ultiple events – corroborated here by num erous credible m ilitary officials – of these objects hovering over and even neutralizing ICBMs (Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles). A closed, m ilitary view of this m ight be to take offense, engage in counter-m easures, and attem pt to down such objects. In fact, this w ould be the norm al response. But what if these ET civilizations were say ing, “Please do not destroy your beautiful world – and know this: we will 9 "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" not let you go into space with such m adness and threaten others...” An event showing concern and even a larger cosm ic wisdom could be cons trued over and over again as an act of aggression. Such m isunderstandings and m yopia are the stuff wars are m ade of. Whatever our perceptions of these visitors, th ere is no chance that m isunderstandings can be resolved through violent engagem ent. To cont em plate such m adness is to contem plate the term ination of hum an civilization. It is tim e for our wise elders and our levelheaded diplom ats, like Sen. Pell, to be put in charge of these weighty m atters. To leave this in the hands of a clique of un-elected, self-appointed and unaccountable covert operations is the greatest th reat to US national security and world security in history . Eisenhower was right, but nobody was listening. In light of testim ony showing that covert ac tions have been taken that involved violent engagem ent of these visitors, it is im perative that the international com munity in general and the US Congress and President in particular do the following: ¾ Convene hearings to assess the risks to nationa l and international security posed by the current covert m anagem ent of the subject; ¾ Enforce an im mediate ban on weapons in space and specifically ban the targeting of any extraterrestrial objects since such actions are unwarranted and could endanger the whole of hum anity ; ¾ Develop a special diplom atic unit to interf ace with these extraterrestrial civilizations, foster com munication and peaceful relations; ¾ Develop a suitably em powered and open intern ational oversight group to m anage hum an- extraterrestrial relations and ensure peacef ul and m utually beneficial interactions; ¾ Support international institutions that can ensure the peaceful use of those new technologies related to advanced energy and propulsion sy stem s (see below). In addition to the above, a less obvious – but perhaps equally pressing – threat to world peace arises from the fact that the covert control of this subject has resulted in the world being deprived of the new energy and propulsion technologies discussed earlier. World poverty and a widening gap between rich and poor are serious threats to world peace, which would be corrected by the disclosure and peaceful application of these technologies (see above). The real threat of war over a shrinking supply of fossil fuels in the next 10-20 years further underscores the need for this disclosure. What happens when the 4 billion people living in poverty want cars, electricity and other m ode rn conveniences – all of which depend on fossil fuels? To any thinking person, it is obvious that we m ust transition quickly to the use of these now classified technologies – they are powerful solutions already sitting on a shelf. Of course, a num ber of insiders have pointed out that these technologies are not your grandfather’ s Oldsm obile: They are technological a dvances, like any other, that could be put to violent uses by terrorists, bellicose nations and madm en. But here we enter a catch 22: If these technologies are not forthcom ing soon, we will f ace a certain m eltdown in hum an civilization and the environm ent; if they are disclosed, im mensely powerful new technologies will be out there for possible destructive uses. In the short term , it is prudent to view hum anity as likely to use any new technology violently .

The evidence regarding this subject is clear a nd overwhelm ing: It has not been difficult to make a com pelling case for the reality of UFOs per se. What is a greater challenge is elucidating the architecture of secrecy related to UFOs (see the exposition of this m atter contained in the paper entitled “Unacknowledged” in Section 3.4). But the greatest challenge is explaining the “why .” Why all the secrecy ? Why a “black” or unacknowledged governm ent within the governm ent? Why hide the UFO/ET subject from public view? The “what” or evidence is com plex but m anag eable. The “how” or nature of the secret program s is more difficult, much more com plex and By zantine. But the “why ” — the reason behind the secrecy — is the m ost challenging problem of all. There is not a single answer to this question, but rather num erous inter-related r easons for such extraordinary secrecy . Our investigations and interviews with dozens of top-secret witnesses who have been within such program s have enabled us to understand the reas ons behind this secrecy . They range from the fairly obvious and straight-forward to the really bizarre. Here, I wish to share som e key points regarding this secrecy , why it has been im posed and why it is so difficult for the controlling interests within covert program s to reverse policy and allow disclosure. In The Beginning In the early day s of the ET/UFO phenom ena, m ilitary , intelligence and industrial interests had concerns regarding the nature of the phenom ena, whether it originated from our hum an adversaries and once it was determ ined to be extraterrestrial, how the public would react. In the 1930s and 1940s this was no sm all matter: If these UFOs were of terrestrial origin, they would be evidence of an Earthly adversary w ith technological devices far in advance of US aircraft. And once it was determ ined to be extrat errestrial (som e quarters knew this prior to the end of WWII) there were m any m ore questions than answers. To wit: why were the ETs here? What are their intentions? How do the devices travel at such fantastic speeds and through the vastness of space? How m ight these technologies be applied to the hum an situation – both in war and in peace? How would the public react to this knowledge? What effect would the disclosure of these facts have on hum an belief sy stem s? Political and social sy stem s? From the late 1940s through the early 1950s, a c oncerted effort was m ade to figure out the basic science and technologies behind these spacecraft, prim arily through the direct study and reverse-engineering of the retrieved extraterrest rial objects from New Mexico and elsewhere. It was im mediately recognized that these objects were using laws of phy sics and applied technologies far in advance of internal com bustion engines, vacuum tubes and the like. In the clim ate of the Cold War and in a world where a relatively m inor advantage technologically could tilt the balance of power in the nuclear arm s race, this was no sm all m atter. Indeed, the them e of hum an geo-political dy sfunction appears as a recurring feature of the secrecy related to UFOs – up to the present hour. More on this later. From the Wilbert Sm ith top secret Canadian governm ent docum ent of 1950, we know that this subject was held in greater secrecy than even the developm ent of the hy drogen bom b. There was a trem endous effort underway by the late 1940s to study extraterrestrial hardware, figure out 18 "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" how it operated and see what hum an applications might be m ade from such discoveries. Even then, the project dealing with this subject was extraordinarily covert. It becam e much more so by the early 1950s when substantial progress was m ade on som e of the basic phy sics behind the ET craft energy and propulsion sy stem s. The best we can estim ate, it was then that the entire project becam e increasingly “black” or unacknowledged. The com partm entalization of the project dea ling with UFOs was exponentially increased by the early 1950s when it was realized what it was that these covert projects actually had: Devices display ing phy sics and energy sy stem s that – if disclosed – would forever alter life on Earth. By the Eisenhower era, the UFO/ET projects were increasingly com partm ented away from legal, constitutional chain-of-com mand oversight a nd control. This m eans that – while we know from witness testim ony that Eisenhower knew of the ET craft – the president (and sim ilar leaders in the UK and elsewhere) were increasingly left out of the loop. Such senior elected and appointed leaders were confronted with (as Eisenhower called it) a sophisticated m ilitary - industrial com plex with laby rinthine com partm ented projects that were m ore and m ore out of their control and oversight. From direct w itness testim ony we know that Eisenhower, Kennedy , Carter and Clinton were frustrated in thei r attem pts to penetrate such projects. This is also true of senior congressional lead ers and investigators, foreign leaders and UN leadership. This is indeed an equal opportunity exclusion project – it does not m atter how high your rank or office; if y ou are not deem ed necessary to the project, y ou are not going to know about it. Period. Contrary to popular myth, since the 1960s concern over som e ty pe of public panic when faced with the fact that we are not alone in the universe has not been a m ajor reason for the secrecy . Those in the know – notwithstanding the fantastic tales spun in UFO circles and on the X-Files – understand that fear of hostile ET s has also not been a significant factor. While there has been continued confusion in som e covert circles over the ultim ate purpose behind the ET phenom ena, we know of no knowledgeable inside rs who regard the ETs as a hostile threat. By the 1960s - and certainly by the 1990s - the world was very fam iliar with the concept of space travel and the popular science - fiction industry had thoroughly indoctrinated the masses with the idea of ET s from far away being a possibility . So why the continued secrecy ? The Cold War is over. People would hardly be shocked to find out that we are not alone in the universe (the m ajority of people already believe this - in fact m ost people believe the UFOs are real). Besides, what could be m ore shocki ng than to live through the latter half of the 20th century with thousands of hy drogen bom bs aim ed at every major city in the world? If we can handle that, surely we can handle the idea that ETs are real. The facile explanations of fear, panic, shock and the like do not suffice to justify a level of secrecy so deep that even the President and his CIA Director could be denied access to the inform ation. A Current Estimate Continued secrecy on the UFO subject m ust be re lated, then, to on-going anxiety related to the essential power dy nam ics of the world and how such a disclosure would im pact these. That is, the knowledge related to UFOs/ET phe nom ena m ust have such great potential for changing the status quo that its continued suppression is deem ed essential, at all costs . Going back to the early 1950s, we have found that the basic technology and phy sics behind these ET spacecraft were discovered through very inte nsive reverse-engineering projects. It was precisely at this point that the decision was made to increase the secrecy to an unprecedented 19 "},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" level – one which essentially took the m atter out of ordinary governm ent chain of com mand control as we know it. Why ? Aside from the possible use of such knowledge by US/UK adversaries during the Cold War, it was im mediately recognized that these devices were not y our dad’ s Oldsm obile. The basic phy sics behind the energy generation and propulsion sy stem s were such that they could easily replace all existing energy generation and propulsi on sy stem s on the Earth. And with them , the entire geo-political and econom ic order. In the 1950s, there was no great concern over global warm ing, eco-sy stem collapse, ozone depletion, rain forest loss, bio-diversity degrada tion etc. In the wake of WW II, what was needed was stability , not a new convulsion of the world ec onom ic, technological and geo-political order. Rem ember: those in control like to stay in contro l. They are risk – averse, do not like significant change and do not give up control and power easily . The disclosure of the existence of ET s, with the inevitable disclosure related to these new technologies soon to follow, would change the world forever – and they knew it. This was to be avoided at all costs. Besides, that was the era of “what is good for GM is good for Am erica,” and the sam e would be true of big oil, big coal and the like. The inescapable fact is this: The disclosure of the ET presence would bring with it the certain release of these technologies – and that release would sweep away the entire technological infrastructure of the planet. The changes would be im mense – and sudden. Fifty years later this is m ore true now than then. Why ? Because avoiding the problem in the 1950s – while convenient at the tim e – m eans th at the situation is m ore tenuous now. For exam ple, world dependence on oil and internal com bustion technology is greater now than in 1955. And the world econom y is larger by orders of m agnitude now, so any change would be exponentially greater – and potentially m ore chaotic. And so this is the conundrum : each decade and generation has passed this problem on to the next, only to find any path but continued secrecy more destabilizing than it would have been a decade earlier. In a maddening circle of secrecy , delay of disclosure and increasing world com plexity and dependence on out-dated energy sy stem s, each generation has found itself in a greater squeeze than the one before. As diffi cult as disclosure would have been in the 1950s, disclosure now is even m ore difficult. And potentially Earth-shaking in its consequences. The technological discoveries of the 1950s resulting from the reverse-engineering of extraterrestrial craft could have enabled us to com pletely transform the world econom ic, social, technological and environm ental situation. That such advancem ents have been withheld from the public is related to the change-ave rse nature of the controlling hierarchy at the tim e – and to this day . And m ake no m istake, the changes would be im mense. Consider: A technology which enables energy generation from the so-called zero point field and which enables every hom e, business, factory and vehicle to have its own source of power – without an external fuel source. Ever. No need for oil, gas, coal, nuclear plants or the internal com bustion engine. And no pollution. Period. Consider: A technology using electro-grav itic devices which allows for above surface transportation – no m ore roadway s to cover fer tile farm land since transportation could take place totally above the surface. Sounds great. But in the 1950s, oil was plentiful, nobody worried too m uch about pollution, global warm ing was not the faintest concern and the powers that be just wanted stability . The 20 "},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" status quo. And besides, why risk the tectonic ch anges related to such a disclosure? Let a later generation take care of it. But now, we are that later generation. And 2001 is not 1949. The Earth is straining under the burden of a growing population - now 6 billion people - all of whom want cars, electricity , TV s and the like. Every one knows that we do not have 50 more years of oil - and even if we did, the Earth’ s ecosy stem could not withstand 50 m ore y ears of such abuse. The risks of disclosure are now m uch less than the risks of secrecy . If secrecy con tinues m uch longer, the Earth’ s ecosy stem will collapse. Talk about a big change and global instability ... Many people will consider the technological and econom ic im pact of such a disclosure as the central justification of continued secrecy . After all, we are talking about a multi- trillion dollar per y ear change in the econom y. The entire energy and transportation sectors of the econom y would be revolutionized. And the energy sector - the part where non-renewable fuels are purchased, burned and have to be replenished - will utterly vanish. And while other industries will flourish, only a fool would dism iss the im pact of such a m ulti-trillion dollar segm ent of the econom y disappearing. Certainly the ‘vested interests’ involved in the global industrial infrastructure related to oil, gas, coal and internal com bustion engines and public utilities is no sm all force in the world. But to understand UFO secrecy you m ust consider what all that m oney represents at its core. Power. Massive geo-political power. One m ust consider what will happen when every village in India (or Africa or South Am erica or China) has devices which can generate larg e am ounts of power without pollution and without spending huge sum s of energy on fuel. The entire world will be able to develop in an unprecedented fashion - without pollution and without billions spent on power plants, transm ission lines and com bustible fuels. The have-nots will have. This would widely be considered a good thing: after all, m uch of world instability , warfare and the like is related to m ind-num bing poverty and econom ic depravity in a world of great wealth. Social injustice and extrem e econom ic disparity breeds m uch chaos and suffering in the world. These decentralized, non-polluting technol ogies would change that perm anently . Even the deserts will bloom ... But it m ust be rem embered that geo-political power flows from technological and econom ic prowess. India has over 1 billion people and the US about one-fourth of that, but who has the greater geo-political power? As these new energy sy stem s proliferate, the so-called third world will rapidly reach parity with the industrialized world of Europe, the US and Japan. This will cause a m assive shift in geo- political power. And the industrialized world will find that it m ust then actually share power with the now down-trodden third world. Those in the cat-bird seat currently (and in 1950) have no interest in doing any such thing. We can hardly even support and share power in the United Nations. The release of inform ation on the UFO/ET subject will lead to the global proliferation of new energy sy stem s which will rapidly result in an e qualization of power in the world. The US and Europe have around 600 m illion people. That is only 10% of the world’s population. Once the other 90% rise in technological a nd econom ic standing, it is clear that the geo-political power will shift - or equalize - to the rest of the world. Power will have to be shared. Real global collective security will be inevitable. It is the end of the world as we know it. 21 "},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" When you com bine the econom ic and technological im pact with the geo-political im pact, it becom es obvious that the changes related to ending secrecy are truly tectonic - massive, world- encircling and transform ative. It is not to be regarded lightly . But 50 y ears after the world could have had these new technologies — and 50 long y ears of ecological degradation, social and econom ic chaos and disparity — we find that we are the last generation in the long line of passing the cosm ic hot potato known as the UFO secrecy problem . And here we stand, holding this hot pot ato, but what shall we do about it? To end the secrecy m eans vast and profound changes in virtually every aspect of hum an existence — econom ic, social, technological, philosophical, geo-political and so forth. But to continue the secrecy and the suppression of these new energy and propulsion technologies means som ething far m ore destabilizing: the collapse of the Earth’s ecosy stem and the certain depletion of the fossil fuels on which we depend. And the growing anger of the have-nots, who are needlessly being deprived of a full and dignified life. There are no m ore generations to which we can pass this cosm ic hot potato: we m ust deal with it and do what should have been done in 1950. The Webs We Weave As if the foregoing was not enough to justify secr ecy , recall that extraordinary things have been done to m aintain this secrecy . The infrastruct ure needed to m aintain and expand the level of secrecy which can deceive presidents and CIA Directors and senior congressional leaders and European Prim e Ministers and the like is substantial - and illegal. Let me be clear, the entity which controls the UFO matter and its related technologies has more power than any single government in the world or any single identified world leader. That such a situation could arise was forewarn ed by President Eisenhower when, in January 1961, he cautioned us regarding the growing “m ilita ry-industrial com plex.” This was his last speech to the world as president - and he was warn ing us directly of a frightening situation about which he had personal knowledge. For Eise nhower had seen the ET craft and deceased ET bodies. He knew of the covert program s dealing with the situation. But he also knew that he had lost control of these projects and that they were lying to him about the extent and full nature of their research and developm ent activities. Indeed, the current state-of-the-art in secrecy is a hy brid, quasi-governm ent, quasi privatized operation which is international — and functions outside of the purview of any single agency or any single governm ent. “The Governm ent” — as you and I and Thom as Jefferson m ay think of it — is really quite outside the loop. Rather, a select, tightly controlled and com partm entalized ‘black’ or unacknowledged project controls these matters. Access is by inclusion alone and if y ou are not included, it does not m atter if you are CIA Director, President, Chairm an of Senate Foreign Relations or UN Secretary General, y ou sim ply will not know about or have access to these projects. Indeed the situation is so dire that senior Join t Chiefs of Staff leaders in the Pentagon who I have briefed have no m ore access to such projects than any other civilian - unless they are on the “inside” for som e reason. But this is rare. To acquire and m aintain such power all types of things have been done. We are rem inded of that Robert Frost poem in which he describes “t he webs we weave...” But how does such an entity extract itself from such a web of secrecy , deceit, lies and insubordination? To be specific, this group has usurped power and rights not legally granted to it. It is extra- constitutional, both in the US and in the UK and other countries around the world. 22 "},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" I will grant the possibility that, at least initially , this covert undertaking was designed to maintain secrecy and avoid instability . But the risk s of inadvertent leaks — or a national or world leader deciding legally that it was tim e for disclosure — m ade it essential to weave a web of greater and greater secrecy and of illegal operations . And now the web has closed in on the operation itself. That is, the com plexity of the com partm enta lized projects, the degree of unconstitutional and unauthorized activity , the “privatization” (or theft) by corporate partners (the “industrial” part of the m ilitary -industrial com plex) of advanced tec hnologies, the continued ly ing to legally elected and appointed leaders and to the public — all of these and m ore have contributed to a psy chology of continued secrecy — because disclosure would expose the greatest scandal in recorded history. For exam ple, how would the public react to the fact that the degradation of the entire Earth’ s ecosy stem and the irretrievable loss of thousands of species of plants and anim als now extinct due to pollution, has been utterly unnecessary — and could have been avoided if only an honest release of this inform ation had occurred in the 1950s? How would society react to the knowledge that trillions of dollars have been spent on unauthorized, unconstitutional projects over the y ears? And that these taxpay er dollars have been used by corporate partners in this secrecy to develop spin-off technologies based on the study of ET objects that were later patented and used in highly profitable technologies? Not only have the taxpay ers been defrauded, they have then been made to pay a prem ium for such breakthroughs that were the result of research paid for by them ! And this does not address the intellectual property theft of such technologies from the ETs. While the basic energy generation and propulsion technologies have been withheld, these corporate partners have profited wildly from other breakthroughs and benefits in electronics, miniaturization and related areas. Such covert technology transfers constitutes a m ulti-trillion dollar theft of technologies that really should be public dom ain since taxpay ers have paid for it. And how would the public react to the fact that the m ulti-billion dollar space program , using internal com bustion rockets and the like, has been a prim itive and unnecessary experim ent since much more advanced technologies and propulsion sy stem s were in existence before we ever went to the m oon? NASA and related agencies have, for the most part, been as m uch a victim of this secrecy as has the rest of the governm ent and the public. Only a sm all, very com partm entalized fraction of NASA people know of the real ET technologies hidden away in these projects. Certainly my uncle, who helped design the luna r m odule which took Neil Arm strong to the m oon, was as m uch a victim an any one insofar as he was denied access to these technological breakthroughs. He had to rely on the old phy sics and the old internal com bustion jet thruster technologies just like every one else. What a sham e. The inescapable reality is this: This secret project, no m atter how well intentioned initially , got carried away with its own secret power. It a bused this power. It has hijacked our future for fifty years. In fact, the quiet coup d’etat of the late 1940s and early 1950s, once exposed, could result in real instability today . But the situation is actually much worse than this. All that is written above is dwarfed by a larger problem : The covert group running these UFO related black projects have also had exclusive sway over the early day s of an em bry onic extraterrestrial-hum an relationship. And it has been tragically m ism anaged — nearly to the point of genuine global catastrophe. For what happens when an unelected, unappointed, self-selecting, m ilitarily oriented group alone has to deal with inter-species relations be tween hum ans and ETs? Well, as in m ost areas, if 23 "},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" you wear rose-colored glasses the entire world looks red. And if y ou are wearing military glasses, every new and uncontrolled developm ent will be seen as a potential or real military threat. The nature of such a group — which is inordina tely controlled and incestuous — is that it is hom ogenous in world-view and mind-set. Power and control are preem inent qualities. Such extrem e secrecy creates a very dangerous m ilieu in which checks and balances, give and take, are utterly lacking. And in such an environm ent, very dangerous decisions can be m ade with inadequate feedback, discussion or insight from needed perspectives that are, per force, excluded. In such an environm ent of extrem e secrecy , m ilitarism and paranoia, we have found that im mensely dangerous actions have been taken agai nst the ETs. Indeed, we have m ultiple inside sources who have described to us the use of in creasingly advanced technologies to track, target and destroy extraterrestrial assets. If there is even a 10% chance that this is true ( I am convinced it is 100% accurate) we are dealing with a global dipl om atic and social crisis which is utterly out of our control but which puts the entire planet at risk. Rem ember, covert reverse-engineering projects have resulted in huge quantum leaps forward in technologies that, once applied to m ilitary sy stem s, could be a real threat to ETs who may be here peacefully . The attem pts to rapidly militarize space are likely a result of a m yopic, militaristic and paranoid view of extraterrestrial projects and intentions. If left unchecked, it can only result in catastrophe. Indeed this group, no m atter how well-intentioned, is in urgent need of exposure so that global statesm en with a new perspective can intercede in this situation. While we see no evidence that the ET civilizations are at all hostile, it is also clear that it is unlikely that they will allow unfettered and growing interfe rence with their operations. Self-defense is likely a universal quality . And while trem endous restraint has been shown by the ET s thus far, m ight there be a “cosm ic trip wire” if hum an covert technologies begin to reach parity and we are using such advanced technologies in a bellicose fashion? The prospect is sobering. We need our Jim my Carters and Dalai Lam mas and other international statesm en involved with so vast a problem . But if access is denied -and the subject rem ains undisclosed and off the global radar screen — we are left with the unelected few to decide our fate and act on our behalf. This m ust change, and soon. In the final analy sis, while the changes attenda nt such a disclosure related to UFOs and ETs would be massive and profoundly im pact virtually every aspect of life on Earth, it is still the right thing to do. Secrecy has taken on a life of its own — it is a growing cancer which needs to be cured before it destroy s the life of Earth and all who dwell on her. The reasons for secrecy are clear: Global power, econom ic and technological control, geo- political status quo, the fear of scandal surrounding the exposure of such projects and their behavior and so forth. But the one thing m ore dangerous than disclos ure is continued secrecy . The Earth is dy ing because we are killing her. The top 250 people and fam ilies in the world have the net worth of 2.5 billion of our poorest citizens. The prom ising relationship between hum anity and people from other planets is being m ilitarized and strain ed by failed thinking and failed program s run com pletely in secret. As daunting as disclosure m ay be, with all its potential for short-term instability and change, continued secrecy m eans that we will destroy the Earth through our folly and greed. The future of hum anity , which has been delay ed and hijacked for the past 50 y ears, cannot be hijacked for 50 more. For we do not have 50 m ore y ears - th e Earth’s ecosy stem will collapse before then. 24 "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" There are no easy choices. But there is one right one. Will y ou help us m ake it? 3.4 UNACKNOWLEDGED Can the governm ent keep a secret? A really big secret — the biggest of all tim e? When the peccadilloes of every politician and governm ent leader are prim e tim e news, could the governm ent hide from us the m ost astounding discovery in the history of the world — the existence of extraterrestrial life? Well, y es — and no. First, the concept of governm ent m ust be rede fined, because there exists the governm ent of “we the people,” elected and appointed officials, public representatives, th e executive, legislative and judicial branches, etc., etc., a la y our standard junior high civics course. But then, there is also the unacknowledged “gove rnm ent:” the “governm ent” of deep cover, deep black projects, contract agents and com panies, and shadowy m id-level functionaries whose task it is to ensure that the governm ent of ‘we the people’ knows little or nothing about the unacknowledged “governm ent.” The right hand does not know — or often want to know — what the left hand is doing... But we’re getting a little ahead of ourselves now. First som e background. For nearly eleven y ears I have quietly researched how real secrecy is m aintained, in the latter half of the twentieth century . What I have f ound is astonishing, and frankly unbelievable. What you are about to read is the truth — but I adm it that I would not have believed it had som eone told me this 10 years ago. You m ay want to read the rest of this article as if it were a fictional story . You may feel more com fortable looking at all of this from a distance. But let som e part of you know that this is the truth. This section is not about whether UFOs/ETs are r eal, or are visiting Earth. Let’s get this out of the way first, since it is the easy part: UFOs ar e real; they are of extraterrestrial origin; they have been around for decades (if not centuries); ther e is no evidence that they are hostile; there is probably more than one ty pe of life form vi siting us; and aspects of the “governm ent” have known this for 50 y ears, at least. The m ore difficult part of this subject is getting y our m ind around the fact that som ething this extraordinary is real, and y et rem ains som ehow unreal, hidden, secret, enigm atic. That the official governm ent — and the official keepers of truth in the m edia and science — have been deceived for this long is a tribute to the sophistication, depth, breadth and ubiquity of a secret program unparalleled in history . Indeed, the story of how — and why — this d eception has existed exceeds the extraterrestrial phenom enon itself in bizarreness, mystery and incre dulity . In fact, it seem s that the effectiveness of the secrecy is itself related to the stunning incre dulity of the nature of the secrecy . Put another way , the why s, hows, and wherefores of these secret projects are so bizarre and unbelievable, that they provide their own best cover: no one woul d believe it even if they cam e upon it. It is absolutely over the top. To be honest, m y own first reaction to what y ou are about to read was, “Yeah, right...” But then confirm ation after confirm ation, and independent corroborati on after independent corroboration convinced m e of it. And then I was say ing, “Oh God...” Space here only perm its me to share with y ou the highlights of 6 y ears of intense, behind-the- scenes research. Som eday , I hope the entire story can be told, nam es and all, but for now allow 25 "},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" me to paint for y ou a broad picture, and som e of the details. This inform ation com es from personal, private and exquisitely sensitive m eetings and long discussions with very senior and relevant m ilitary , intelligence, political and priv ate corporate sources. The search for truth regarding these secret projects has brought m e to heads of state, roy alty , CIA officials, NSA operatives, US and foreign military leaders, political leaders and high-tech corporate contractors. The process has been exhaustive, relentless and m ind-blowing. Safety and prudence requires that I leave their nam es out of this for now; by the tim e y ou finish reading this, the reason will be obvious. Beginning at least as early as World War II, we found that certain officials in the US governm ent knew that we were not alone, that there were advanced m achines fly ing around in certain regions of the WWII conflict which were not ours, and not theirs. A m edical colleague and friend, whose relative was a celebrated WWII pilo t, has told m e that this pilot was sent to Europe by the president to figure out what these so -called “foo” fighters were. He reported back to the president that they were extraterrestrial spacecraft. From there on, it gets m ore and m ore strange. A retired general, who later becam e right hand man to a certain CIA director, told me this: That as a m ilitary officer in 1946, he was responsible for writing “non-responsive” letters regarding a seri es of day tim e sightings of UFOs over Idaho. He said people knew the UFOs were real, but soon a Cold War was on, and later a few hot wars ensued, and every one was concerned with global therm onuclear war — so who had tim e to worry about these enigm atic but harm less ETs? Who indeed? Multiple new, independently corroborating witnesses told us of the crash and retrieval of ET spacecraft in 1947 in New Mexico and in 1948 in Kingm an Arizona. Now this really got som eone’s attention, and the nam e of the gam e was, henceforth, advanced extraterrestrial technology . How does it work; what can it be used for; how will they use it; what if the Soviets figure it out before we do; what if it leaks out and som e new Hitler uses it to dom inate the world; what if people panic when they learn of it; what if? And a m illion m ore questions, at the tim e all unanswered. And thus was born the secret project of the m illennium . After all, at the tim e, we were working on the developm ent of the hy drogen bom b — and our arch enem y the Soviets were hot on our tail. What could be m ore destabilizing to an already fragile world order than the introduction of in ter-stellar propulsion technology to a world of vacuum tubes and internal com bustion engines? To say we were facing a quantum leap in technological capability is an understatem ent. And we wanted it safely for ourselves. So, “National Security ” dem anded that this entir e m atter be kept quiet at all costs. And no cost was spared in doing so. But there was one very large and busy fly in this ointm ent: The ETs were fly ing, som etim es in form ation, with thousands of witnesses, over the sk ies of Am erica, and the rest of the world. Now, how do y ou hide that? The m ind hides it. In an Orwellian twist, it was found from past psy chological warfare efforts during WWII that, indeed, if y ou tell a lie often e nough, especially if told by ‘respected’ authority figures, the people will believe it. It appears that one of the m asters of psy chological warfare during WWII was put in charge of this in the late 1940s. General Walte r Bedell Sm ith helped coordinate the psy chological warfare com ponents of this problem , and helped launch the big lie: UFOs, even though m illions have seen them , do not exist. 26 "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" For every sighting that m ade its way into public awareness, there would be official denial and, worse, ridicule of the event and the observers. Harvard Astronom er Donald Menzel was trotted out to tell the world that it was all hy steria, that UFOs were not real, that it was all poppy cock. So well into the 1950s, a relatively sm all group of people knew the truth, and kept the truth to them selves. When an event occurred which got the m edia’s attention, authority figures would deny and ridicule it. Since hum ans are generally insecure social creatures, and m ore like lem mings that we would like to adm it, it becam e clear that if y ou wanted to avoid em barrassm ent, ridicule and social estrangem ent, y ou kept quiet about UFOs, even if y ou had seen one up close and personal. Add to this the active encouragem ent of wacky stories and bizarre tall tales within the civilian UFO subculture, aided by the natura lly occurring level of crazies and crack-pots in society generally and, well, y ou get the pictur e. Any respectable person –and especially the “respectable” m edia, scientists and political leader s — would have to view this as the “topic non grata” to avoid. (Having gone through what I have in the past 11 y ears, I really can’t say I blam e them ...) But this is all very conventional stuff, really . The bizarre twists began in the 1950s, when a new m odel for covert projects evolved; a Frankens tein was created, but now it has gotten a will of its own, has gotten up off the table, breaking all restraints, and is m oving around am ongst us. In late 1993 and into 1994, 1995 and 1996, from one m eeting to another, a shocking truth em erged. Som ehow on the way to the 90s, som ething awful had happened: The entire m atter had been largely privatized, was 10 levels deep black and was operating outside the constitutional chain of com mand of the US or any other governm ent. Now, I know what you are thinking — I thought the sam e at first — but hear m e out. Within a few m onths of that initial m eeting in July of 1993, I and/or members of our team had met with very , very senior officials of the CIA, Congress, the Clinton Adm inistration, the UN, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the m ilitary in England a nd elsewhere. Our initial logic was first to m ake the case to these folks that sin ce the Cold War was over, a window of opportunity had opened through which a m ajor disclosure on this m atter coul d be made. The tim e had com e to return this matter to the international com munity . Right? Wrong! Virtually without exception, leaders in the m ilitary , intelligence fields, politics and nationa l security areas agreed that the tim e had com e for the truth to be told. Problem is, they had no access to the truth, or the data, or the cases, or the technology or the deceased ET bodies in storage (Yes, we know where they are and it is not Wright Patterson Air Force Base any longer). Those who I thought would be in the loop were out, and the ones running the show were a strange com bination of covert operatives and priv ate corporate interests. From then on it was through the looking glass we go. My ancestors fought in the Am erican Revoluti on in North Carolina. They fought for the establishm ent of a constitutional, representative form of governm ent; now I wondered what had happened to the constitution. Like a very bad dream , I kept hoping to awaken to find it was not true. How could I share this with others? W ho would believe it? It was bad enough for a doctor in NC to m aintain that we were being visited by advanced extraterrestrial life form s, but this? I asked a friend who was on the staff of Presi dent Reagan’s National Security Council how this could be true. How could som e of the m ost powerful people in the world — in governm ent, in the m ilitary , the senior intelligence and national security areas — not only not know about this, but have no access to this inform ation? I asked him if we let the President know exactly who out there really does know about this and he called them into the Oval Office and said, “I am the President of the United States and I want y ou to tell m e every thing y ou know about this m atter,” what would they do? 27 "},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" He laughed and said, “Steve, if they don’t want the President to know, they will sim ply lie to the president and say no such thing exists. It’s done all the tim e...” I was stunned by the cy nicism of this, and by the clear breech in constitutional law. Under the ruse of “plausible deniability ” to “protect” senior governm ent officials, this apparently is done in certain sensitive areas, a nd the UFO m atter is the m ost sensitive of all. In a m eeting with a very senior leader in the intelligence com munity , whose position any one in the public would assum e allowed him to know every bit of im portant secret inform ation, I discovered that, even though this official knew the matter was real, that the UFOs were real, he had no access to either past or current inform ation or projects dealing with the ET subject. Again, I was stunned. Ditto for very senior Senate investigators with subpoena power and top secret clearance. Ditto for people at the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Ditto for senior UN people. Ditto for senior Ministry of Defense officials in Great Britain . Ditto for heads of state. And so it went, on and on. No deception this ; these m eetings were arranged by personal, back-door contacts and friends. Ironically , these l eaders were turning to us for inform ation, analy sis and, strangely , action, to get this secret m ess fixed. My pointing out that I am only a country doctor from North Carolina, with a wife, four kids, a minivan and a golden retriever did not change this reality . So in m y ‘spare’ tim e, I have done what I could. UNACKNOWLEDGED SPECIAL ACCESS PROJECTS. USAPS. This term — concept, really — took som e tim e to take hold. Call m e na ive, but I really believe in dem ocracy and the constitution, the office of the president, the im por tance of a congress and so on. But such quaint notions at som e point had to be assim ilated in m y mind and reconciled with this new reality : That the president, and congress and the courts and the UN and all the other world leaders exist. They worry about taxes, m oney , program s of this sort or another. But the really big stuff - leave them out of it. After all, these people com e and go every 2 or 4 y ears. What they don’ t know won’ t hurt them ; besides, we’re doing them a favor by keeping them innocent of any knowledge of these secret projects. At any rate, these projects are UNACKNOWLEDGED, and they don’ t really exist at all... What is a USAP? It is a top secret, com partm entalized project requiring special access even for those with a top secret clearance, AND it is un acknowledged. This m eans that if som eone - any one- including your superiors, including the com mander and chief, the president, asks y ou about it, y ou reply that no such project exists. You lie. People in these USAPS are dead serious about keeping their project secret, and will do nearly any thing to keep the story covered, and to keep both other officials and the public disinform ed. And the grand daddy of all USAPS is the UFO/ET m atter. Rem ember that a top secret Canadian docum ent written by Wilbert Sm ith in 1950 stated that he had found that a secret US group was working on the UFO matter, including the technology behind the UFOs, and that this was the most secret undertaking in the US governm ent, exceeding even the secrecy surrounding the developm ent of the H-bom b. Now im agine if y ou will, this project 50 y ears later. A lot of water has gone beneath the bridge. There has been 50 y ears and countless b illions spent on various aspects of the project: reverse engineering extraterrestrial technology to figure out how it works; experim ents with non- linear propulsion and com munications sy stem s; m assive public disinform ation efforts and the deceit of constitutionally elected and appointed officials and bodies; and m ore. Add to this active disinform ation — the hoaxing or sim ulation of false ET events, to deceive the public and serve as decoy s, thus taking peopl es’ attention away from the real action. 28 "},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" Abductions.

Not only does this nonsense serve as effective decoy s to the unfunded and unprofessional civilian UFO subculture, it creates the patina of craziness and tawdrin ess needed to keep “respectable” scientists, m ainstream m edia and public officials silent. It keeps the whole m atter safely off their radar screens. From the m id-1940s to the m id to late 1950s, as these m atters go, this secret group was som ewhat conventional. A num ber of officials in the Trum an and Eisenhower adm inistrations knew about it and were involved. It was genuinely felt to be im perative to the national security that this m atter be kept quiet for a while. And I believe they were acti ng in good faith, and within the reasonable lim its of our constitutional dem ocracy . But apparently som etim e in the m id to late Eisenhower y ears, a pattern developed where those who legally should be in the loop were shoved out. We have m ore than one corroborating source that this was the case in the late Eisenhower y ears and the Kennedy Adm inistration. First hand witnesses have told us that Eisenhower was furious that he was being kept in the dark about a num ber of im portant aspects of the UFO/ET m atter. He had seen the ET spacecraft and bodies, and y et he found that extraordinary pr ojects were under way , and he was out of the loop. Is it any wonder then that, notwithstanding the fact that he was a five star general and conservative Republican, he warned of the “m ilitary -industrial com plex” in his last address to the nation as president? People forget that it was this five star general — and not Abby Hoffm an — who coined the term m ilitary -industrial com plex, fi rst warning us of the dangers of its excesses. Why ? Because he had seen those excesses up close and personal. Fast forward to June of 1963. Kennedy is fl ying to Berlin to deliver his fam ous speech proclaim ing, “I am a Berliner.” On board Air Force One is a m ilitary m an who relates the following: Kennedy , on the long flight, at one poi nt began discussing the UFO m atter with this military officer. He adm itted that he knew the UF Os were real, had seen the evidence, but then astonished the officer by stating that “the w hole m atter is out of m y hands, and I don’t know why ...” Kennedy said that he wanted the truth to come out, but that he couldn’t do it. And this is the President of the United States, the Com mander in Chief of the arm ed forces, stating that the matter is out of his hands, and he doesn’t know why . I wonder if he found out before he was killed later that y ear. Eisenhower, Kennedy , Clinton Adm inistration figures, m ilitary leaders, intelligence leaders, foreign leaders. All out of the loop. But all know its real. What is going on? USAPS is only part of the story . The sm aller part. Rem ember Eisenhower warning of the military -industrial com plex? Operative word: industr ial, private, privatized. In discussing this matter with a form er head of the Ministry of Defense in Great Britain in July of 1995, I found that he was sim ilarly kept out of the loop. We found once again that the really secret stuff was kept from even a m an who was head of MI5 and the MoD. The answer existed in part with USAPS, but m ore largely with private contract entities. The US governm ent builds alm ost nothing (thank goodness...). The B2 Stealth bom ber is not built by the US governm ent, but FOR the US governm ent by private industry . And private industry keeps secrets even better than USAPS. It m akes sense: After all these y ears no body knows the form ula for Coca Cola. Not even the President of the United States can get it. The form ula is secret, and private. 29 "},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" Now if y ou will, com bine the proprietary power of private secrets with a com bined liaison with USAPS and you build a covert fortress which is virtually im penetrable. Because if y ou try to get at it through the private sector, it is protected by proprietary privilege. And if y ou try to get to it through the public sector-governm ent it is hidden in USAPS, and the “governm ent” as y ou and I ordinarily think of it is clueless. And from personal experience I can tell you that if you inform the leaders of this, they will hold their heads in their hands and say , as I once did, “Oh m y God...” So, what is the essential profile of this covert operation? Description: This group is a quasi-governm ental, USAPS related, quasi-private entity operating internationally /transnationally . The m ajority of operations are centered in private industrial “work for others” contract projects related to the understandi ng and application of advanced extraterrestrial technologies. Related com partm entalized units, which are also USAPS, are involved in disinform ation, public deception, active disinform ation, so-called abductions and mutilations, reconnaissance and UFO tracking, sp ace-based weapons sy stem s and specialized liaison groups (for exam ple to m edia, political l eaders, the scientific com munity , the corporate world, etc.). Think of this entity as a hy brid between governm ent, USAPS, and private industry . The group consists prim arily of m id-level US APS-related military and intelligence operatives, USAPS or black units within certain high-tech corporate entities, and select liaisons within the international policy analy sis com munity , certain religious groups, the scientific com munity and the media, am ong others. The identities of som e of these entities and individuals are known to us, though m ost rem ain unidentified. Approxim ately 1/3 to 1/2 or those com prising the decision-m aking body are now in favor of a public disclosure of som e ty pe on this m atter; these are, in general, the y ounger m embers who have less com plicity in past excesses. The remaining m embers are opposed or am bivalent regarding a near-term disclosure. Actual policy and decision-m aking seem s to rest predom inantly at this tim e in the private, civilian sector, as opposed to USAP-related m ilitary and intelligence officials, though som e inform ation indicates that there is significant rela tive autonom y in certain areas of operations. It is our current assessm ent that a rising degree of deba te exists regarding cer tain covert operations and the advisability of a disclosure. Many com partm entalized operations within “black ” or USAPS projects are structured so that those working on the task m ay be unaware that it is UFO/ET related. For exam ple, som e aspects of the so-called “Star Wars” effort, or SDI, are intended to target extraterrestrial spacecraft that com e into close proxim ity to Earth, but the vast m ajority of scientists and workers in the SDI program are unaware of this. We have learned from three separate, corrobora ting sources that since the early 1990s, at least 2 extraterrestrial spacecraft have been target ed and destroy ed by experim ental space-based weapons sy stem s. The vast m ajority of political leaders, incl uding White House officials, m ilitary leaders, congressional leaders, UN leaders and other world leaders are not routinely briefed on this matter. When and if inquiries are m ade, they are told not hing about the operations, nor is the existence of any operation confirm ed to them . In general the na ture of this covert entity ensures that such leaders do not even know to whom such inquiries should be addressed. International cooperation exists to a wide extent, though som e witnesses state that certain countries, particularly China, have aggressively pursued som ewhat independent agendas. 30 "},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" Major bases of operations, apart from widely dive rsified private sites, include Edwards Air Force Base in California, Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, particularly S4 and adjacent facilities, Los Alam os New Mexico, Fort Huachuca Ar izona (Arm y Intelligence Headquarters), the Redstone Arsenal in Alabam a, and a rela tively new, expanding underground facility accessible only by air in a rem ote area of Utah, am ong othe rs. Additional facilities and operations centers exist in a num ber of other countries, including the United Kingdom , Australia, and Russia. Num erous agencies have deep cover, black, US APS related units involve d with these operations, including the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), the National Security Agency (NSA), the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), th e Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), Naval Intelligence, Arm y Intelligence, Air Force Intelligence, the FBI, and a group known as MAJI control. An even more extensiv e list of private, civilian and corporate entities have significant involvem ent. The m ajority of scientific, technical and advanced technology operations are centered in the civilian industrial and research firm s. Significant — and lethal — security is provided by private contractors. The m ajority of personnel as well as the leadersh ip of m ost if not all of these agencies and private groups are uninvolved and unaware of these com partm entalized, unacknowledged operations. For this reason, sweeping accusations related to any particular agency or corporate entity are wholly unwarranted. “Plausible de niability ” exists at m any levels. Moreover, specialization and com partm entalization allows a num ber of operations to exist without those involved knowing that their task is related to the UFO/ET subject. Both positive inducem ents to cooperate and pena lties for violating secrecy are extraordinary . A senior m ilitary source has related to us that at least 10,000 people have received $1 m illion or more each to ensure their cooperation, over the past few decades. Regarding penalties, we know of m ore than one credible case where individuals have had their fam ilies threatened should they break the code of silence, and we have learne d of two recent alleged ‘suicides’ at a private contract industrial firm which occurred after the victim s began to violate secrecy on a reverse- engineering project related to ET technology . Funding: A senior congressional investigator has pr ivately related to us that “black budget” funds apparently are used for this and sim ilar operations which are USAPS. This ‘black budget’ involves conservatively $10 billion, and m ay exceed $80 billion per y ear. The am ount dedicated to the UFO/ET operation specifically is unknown at this tim e. Additionally , significant funds are derived from overseas sources and private and institutional sources. Am ounts deriving from these activities are also unknown by us. This is part of what we know at this tim e. Obviously , there are m ore questions than answers here, and what is unknown exceeds what is known. Nevertheless, we have, I believe, made significant and historic advances in understanding how this entity operates. I have presented this general assessm ent to a num ber of im portant m ilita ry, political and policy institute figures, and was surprised that it was regarded as quite accurate and in agreem ent with independent assessm ents arrived at separately by them . But the larger question is why ? As in life in general, the whats, whos and hows are alway s easier than the why s. Why the continued secrecy and deception? I am reluctant to go too m uch further out on th is lim b, because here we get into questions related to ultim ate m otive and purpose, which is al way s a rather squishy area, ill-defined in the best of cases. And this, I am afraid, is no ordi nary m atter, and the em otions, m otives and purpose behind such extraordinary and high-stakes actions are likely com plex and dissonant. Indeed, such motives are likely a very m ixed bag, ranging from the initially noble and well-intentioned, to the depraved. 31 "},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" Sen. Barry Goldwater 29 told m e in 1994 that the secrecy surrounding the ET subject was “a dam n m istake then and a dam n m istake now...” I am inclined to agree with the senator here, but the drive for secrecy was not and is not altogether rooted in stupidity . Rather, I see it rooted in fear and a lack of trust. While I generally dislike psy cho-ba bble, I believe the psy chology of all of this is im portant. It is my belief that secrecy , especially extrem e secrecy of this degree, is alway s a sy mptom of illness. If y ou have secrets in y our fam ily , it is a sickness, born out of fear, insecurity and distrust. This, I feel, can be extended to com munities, com panies, and societies. Ultim ately , the drive for secrecy is a sy mptom of a deeper m alaise derived from a fundam ental lack of trust, and an abundance of fear and insecurity . In the case of UFOs/ET, the early day s of the 1940s and 1950s were, I sense, a tim e of fear bordering on The USSR was expanding its em pire, and arm ing itself to the teeth with bigger and deadlier nuclear weapons. And they were beating us in the race into space. Now along com e extraterrestrial spacecraft, wh ich are retrieved along with deceased (and one living) life form . Panic. Fear. Confusion. Countless unanswered questions arise, all tinged with fear. Why are they here? How will the public react? How can we secure their technology — and keep it from our m ortal enem ies? How can we tell the people that the m ost powerful air force in the world cannot control its airspace? What w ill happen to religious belief? To the econom ic order? To political stability ? To the keepers of current technology ? To.... It is m y opinion that the early day s of secrecy were predictable, even understandable, and possibly even justifiable. But as the decades rolled by , and especially with th e end of the Cold War, fear alone does not fully explain the secrecy . After all, 1996 is not 1946 — we have been to space, landed on the moon, detected planets around other star sy stem s, found the building blocks of life in far-away space, and about 50% of the population believe the UFOs are real. And the soviet em pire has collapsed. I believe two other significant factors are at pl ay now: Greed and control, and the inertia of decades of secrecy . Greed and control are easily understood: Im agine being involved with a project unraveling and then apply ing advanced extraterrestrial technol ogy . The power and econom ic im pact — and thus value — of such technology exceeds the com bined significance of the internal com bustion engine, electricity , the com puter chip and all fo rm s of telecom munications. We are talking about the technology of the next m illennium . You th ink the com puter/inform ation age revolution is big? Fasten y our seat belts, because down the road — sooner or later — will be the non-linear, zero point technological revolutions based on advanced ET technologies. No wonder the corporate, m ilitary -industrial com plex interest and secrecy exceeds even that of the governm ent related USAPS. The form ula for Coca Cola has nothing on this. The bureaucratic inertia of large secret operations is y et another m atter. After decades of operations, and of lies, public deceptions and wor se, how does such a group unravel all the webs it has weaved? There is a certain addictive allure to secret power for som e ty pes of people; they are charged by having and knowing secrets. And there is the specter of a sort of cosm ic   29 See a l etter by Senat or Gol dwat er in 1975 i ndi cat ing hi s interest and frust rat ion wi th this subject in Appendi x I (Docum ent A1.2). 32 "},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" Watergate, with all m anner of people calling for this head or that. It becom es easier to m aintain the status quo, som ething all bureaucracies are adept at doing. And even now there is fear. Not just fear of be ing exposed in the age of Watergate, this -gate and that-gate, but a rather xenophobic and prim itive fear of the unknown. Who are these hum anoids, why are they here; how dare they enter our airspace without our perm ission! Hum anity has a long tradition of fearing - and hating - that which is different, unknown, from elsewhere. Witness the still-ram pant racial, et hnic, religious, and nationalistic prejudice and hatred that ravage the world of hum anity . There is an alm ost ingrained xenophobic response to the unknown and that which is different. And it is cer tain that the ETs are m ore different from us than, say , Protestants are from Catholics in Ireland. I once asked a phy sicist involved with m ilitary and intelligence operations related to UFOs why we were attem pting to destroy these spacecr aft with advanced space-based weapons. He im mediately becam e agitated and said, “Those cowboy s running this thing are so arrogant, so out of control, that they view any entry by a UFO into our air space as an offense worthy of a hostile response. And they are going to get us into an inter-planetary conflict if we are not careful...” And so it goes. Fear. Fear of the unknown. Greed and control. Institutional inertia. These are a few of what I see as the current anim ating forces driving the continued secrecy . But where to from here? How to transform this situation from extrem e secrecy to disclosure? There is an old Chinese proverb that say s, “Unl ess we change directions, we are likely to end up where we are going.” How true. And where we are going in this area is im mensely dangerous. Extrem e secrecy , especially on som ething this far-reaching and im portant, underm ines dem ocracy , subverts the constitution, c oncentrates enorm ous technological power in the hands of the unelected few and puts the entire planet in harm s way . This m ust end. I suggest that the Adm inistration, in coopera tion with Congress, sponsor open hearings where these witnesses, who now num ber over 400, could ope nly testify to what they know about the UFO/ET m atter. This would constitute a definitive disclosure, I assure y ou. In this regard, you can help in two way s: 1) Write the President and ask that he issue an executive order perm itting these witnesses to safely com e forward, and at the sam e tim e write your Senator and Congressm an and request that they sponsor open hear ings where these witnesses m ay speak. 2) Contact us im mediately if you or som eone y ou know m ay be a current or form er governm ent, m ilitary or corporate witness. We have protective m easures in place, and the more witnesses we have, the stronger th e case — and the greater the m argin of safety for all concerned. Please help us if y ou can. The international com munity and the United Na tions should sim ilarly hold open hearings on this m atter. We have witnesses from all over the wo rld, and ideally , an international disclosure and evidence gathering effort should begin im mediately . The world com munity should not sit by passively , thus abdicating responsibility to secret operations. The Disclosure Project has for five years been involved in a citizens diplom acy effort, and m ade significant breakthroughs in devel oping protocols to contact these extraterrestrial visitors. Rather than passively watching this as som e distant “phenom enon,” we should attem pt to establish com munication with these life form s, and begin the early stages of an open inter- planetary relationship. If y ou are interested in learning more about how y ou can be involved in such a research and diplom acy effort, contact us. Lastly , we m ust be prepared to forgive.

We learned of plutonium being put on the oatm eal of kids in orphanages, of deliberate radiation releases in populated areas to see “what would happen,” and so forth.

He realized that he was losing control of the UFO subject. He realized that the phenom enon or whatever it was that we were faced with was not going to be in the best hands.

And so it has turned out to be... “It had been discussed with m e on num erous occasions what could happen to me militarily if I discussed this. I would say that the governm ent has done as good a job enforcing secrecy through the installation of abject fear as they have done with any thing within the m emory of m odern m an. I really believe they have done a job. “One older officer discussed with m e what possibly could happen if there was a revelation. He was talking about being erased and I said, ‘Man, what do y ou mean erased?’ And, he said, ‘Yes, y ou will be erased-disappear .” And I said, “How do y ou know all this?’ And he said, ‘I know. Those threats have been m ade and carried out. Those threats started way back in 1947. The Arm y Air Force was give n absolute control over how to handle this. This being the biggest security situation that th is country has ever dealt with and there have been som e erasures...’ “I don’t care what kind of a person y ou are. I don’t care how strong or courageous y ou are. It would be a very fearful situation because from what Matt [this older officer] said, ‘They will go after not only you. They will go after y our fam ily .’ Those were his words. And, so I can only say that the reason that they have m anaged to keep it under wraps for so long is through fear. They are very selective about how they pull som eone out to m ake an exam ple of. And I know that that has been done.” Merle Shane McDow: US Navy Atlantic Com mand “These two gentlem en began to question m e about this event. They were being pretty rough about it, to be honest with y ou. I remember literally putting m y hands up and say ing, ‘Wait a m inute fellows. I am on y our side. Just a minute.’ Because they were not really nice.

From 1993, we spent consid erable tim e and resources briefing the Clinton Adm inistration, including CIA Director Jam es Woolsey , senior m ilitary officials at the Pentagon, and select m embers of Congress, am ong others. In April of 1997, m ore than a dozen such governm ent and m ilitary witnesses were assem bled in Washington DC for briefings with Congressm en, Pentagon officials and others. There, we specifically requested open Congressional Hearings on the subject. None were forthcom ing. In 1998, we set out to “privatize” the disclosure process by raising the funds to videotape, edit, and organize over 100 m ilitary and governm ent witnesses to UFO events and projects. We had estim ated that between $2 m illion and $4 m illi on would be needed to do this on a worldwide basis. By August of 2000 only about 5% of this am ount had been raised but we decided to proceed since further delay was deem ed im prudent given the serious issues involved here. So beginning in August we began creating the Witness Archive Project and we set about the task of traveling all over the world to interview these w itnesses in broadcast quality digital video form at. Due to the severe lim itation of funds, this effort was predom inantly prepared by m yself and a few other volunteers roughly from August 2000 through Decem ber 2000. Beginning in late Decem ber 2000, I began editing over 120 hours of raw digital video testim ony at hom e using a dual-G4 Macintosh with 90 Gigaby tes of storage and a digital video deck. I should note that I am a m edical doctor and not an editor. Nevertheless, from late Decem ber 2000 until late February 2001 the 120 hours were reduced first to 33 hours of select 46 "},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" testim ony and then 18 hours of super-select testim ony .

I share this only so the reader will unders tand that these transcripts and other materials are very likely to contain errors. These include lik ely errors in proper nam es arising from the phonetic spelling of such nam es directly from tran scribed audio tapes of testim ony . I apologize in advance for these. The transcripts (that appear in the Briefing Docum ent) have only been altered to correct for a) length and b) gram mar and readability .

These m aterials are, as y ou can now discern, only the tip of the iceberg of what we have recorded on digital videotape. That is, from over 120 hours of testim ony by over 100 witnesses we transcribed only 33 hours and then further edited m aterials down to a fraction of that am ount. Moreover, the full archive represents the tes tim ony of only 100 witnesses of the m ore than 400 identified to date. The edited testim ony will be appearing in book form .

We hope in the future to secure funding for a 5-6 part broadcast quality video docum entary series to be m ade from the videotaped testim ony we have as the im pact of hearing and seeing these witnesses speak is very m oving. As y ou read this testim ony rem ember that it is indeed only the beginning. The rest is up to you: Call and dem and that Congress and the Presi dent and the leaders of other countries hold hearings into this subject without delay . These witnesses welcom e a subpoena so that they m ay officially testify under oath to what they have experienced and said here. Indeed, the most revealing testim ony waits to be seen since the deepest sources are refusing to com e forward until protected through official Congressional hearings. This then brings m e to m y last poin t: The witnesses who have given testim ony to date are extraordinarily brave m en and wom en – heroes in my ey es – who have taken great personal risks in com ing forward. Som e have been threatened and intim idated. All are risking the ever-present ridicule that attends this subject. Not a single one of them has been paid for his or her testim ony : It has been given freely and without reservation for the good of hum anity . I wish to personally thank them here and extend to them m y pe rsonal, highest respect and gratitude. Please, I im plore y ou not to let this effort and their sacrifice be in vain. Help us place this matter in front of the public, the m edia, and our elected representatives so that the full truth m ay be disclosed, so that those Earth-saving tec hnologies now classified m ay be released, and so hum anity m ay enter a new chapter in its evolution as one of m any people in the cosm os. 47 "},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" This summary is focusing on the testimony of important first-hand witnesses.

Greer, M.D. 5 April 2001 3.8 SUMMARY OF VIDEO TAPED WITNESS TESTIMONY AND GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS 3.8.1 Overview Testim ony of Astronaut Edgar Mitchell May 1998 [Our deepest gratitude goes to Jam es Fox fo r sharing with us this interview. SG] In February 1971 Astronaut Edgar Mitc hell flew on Apollo 14 and was the 6 th ma n to walk on the m oon. In his testim ony , he acknowledges the fact that there have been ET visitations here on Earth as well as crashed cr aft and recovered m aterials and bodies. He also speaks of the concealm ent that has b een prevalent surrounding this subject for over 50 y ears and the lack of oversight and visible Governm ent control. He is concerned over our stewardship of this Earth and sees our growing environm ental crisis as real. EM: Astronaut Edgar Mitchell JF: Jam es Fox EM: In the literature we see accounts from m ilita ry people who have had encounters in flight, and been vectored to chase unidentified objects. These are people who have official positions whose job was to know about possible ex traterrestrial visitation and to do som ething with it, people within Governm ent. There’ s a lot that does go on with these high security classifications-they are under m ilitary rules. I think it is a fairly m uddy area when we are talking about this level of activity . There are som e stories [ about how secrecy has been enforced] that are rather ghastly , as a m atter of fact. I can’ t validate those. I don’ t know that they are necessarily true. But, like m any other stories, they put fear in the hearts of people and that ’s, perhaps, why m any people don’t want to com e forward. My interest basically is what’s the nature of the universe we live in? What is our relationship to the larger reality ? If [ UFOs] are a part of the larger reality and we are deny ing it, that to me is unconscionable. I don’ t live that way . I went into space to learn about the universe we live in, to get new insights, to go bey ond the boundaries of our known existence. And if these phenom ena are really indicators of new inform ation about the cosm os at all, and intelligent life in the cosm os, and our ability to travel in the cosm os, then we ought to get to the bottom of it. It is just m y curiosity that drives m e. There seem s to have been, over the last 50 y ear s at least, a great deal of secrecy surrounding the so-called UFO events. It’ s a very com plex subject. We are not dealing with som ething that’s very sim ple here. We have sightings of all so rts. We’ve been reporting thousands and thousands 48 "},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":" of sightings for 50 y ears or so. Large num bers of those sightings are indeed misperceiving natural phenom enon in som e way . But a large num ber of them are not m isperceiving. They are well docum ented events that represent fly ing craf t that do not m atch any thing we have in an Earthbound arsenal, which is very short of say ing we have validated in the public dom ain that they are ET craft. We have to rely upon peopl e who have been there and interacted, have firsthand data. The only people I know of that claim to have been in that position are form er intelligence, military , and Governm ent people, and som e contractor people whose official duties in the early day s were to investigate this and know about it. Those people were under, at that tim e, great restrictions and high security clearances that prev ented them from telling the general public about it. It would appear that period has long past but they are still under security restriction, or at least believe they are. Yes there have been ET visitations. There have been crashed craft. There have been m aterial and bodies recovered. And there is som e group of people som ewhere that m ay or m ay not be associated with Governm ent at this point, but certainly were at one tim e, that have this knowledge. They have been attem pting to conceal this knowledge or not perm it it to be widely dissem inated. I cannot answer who are these people. But there is a lot of evidence that points to what I call a clandestine group- people who have som e qu asi affiliation with Governm ent and certain Governm ent facilities but operate in a very stealth and secret way that is not generally under high level Governm ent control as far as we can tell. From all that I know, yes there has been ET visitation and m ay continue to be. There have b een craft that have been recovered. There has been a certain am ount of reverse engineering th at has allowed som e of these craft, or som e com ponents, to be duplicated. And, that there are Earthlings who are utilizing som e of this equipm ent in certain way s. And, that, perhaps a large part of the activity that’ s classified as UFO activity - abductions and the whole host of this ty pe of activity - m ay very well not be due to ET activity at all. I would suspect if any is due to ET activity , it is a rather sm all part. And a larger portion is due to hum an type activity , Earthling ty pe activity in a very clandestine fashion. I will stop short of attaching m otivation to this . I don’t know the m otivation. But if it is norm al hum an m otivation, it has to do with power a nd control and greed and m oney and so forth. I think it is long past tim e to open this up to the public. I do not see any thing that suggests, really , m alevolent intent... We see things that, like abductions for exam ple, that many would claim are hostile. To the extent that that m ay be true, I would m ore likely attribute it to som e other [ non ET] cause. There is a m ountain of evidence, if y ou will, that essentially am ounts to sm oking gun evidence that has not been brought forward at this point, at least not by the powers of Governm ent. The question of, has it been kept secret, or how could it be kept secret? It hasn’ t been kept secret. It’s been there all along. But it has been the subject of disinform ation in order to deflect attention and to create confusion so the truth doesn’t com e out. Disinform ation is sim ply another method of stonewalling. And that’s been used consistently for the last 50 y ears or so: Weather 49 "},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" balloons over Roswell as opposed to a crashed craft of som e sort. That is disinform ation. We’ve seen that for 50 y ears. And it’ s the best way to hide som ething. It shouldn’t be any m ore of an effect that ET’s have com e here than that we have gone to the moon. Okay ? It’s just a part of the way things are. And we have to understand it and put it in context of the story of ourselves, our knowledge b ase, of cosm ology , the nature of our existence, who are we, how does the world work. And of course that knowledge does change our understanding of how the world, or the universe at large, works. Until the last 30 years, it was conventional wisdom , both in science and theology , that we are alone in the universe, that we are the whole, single repository of life any where in the known universe. Well no one believes that any more. That changes our concept of who we are and how we fit. And it is becom ing very clear that the way we have conducted ourselves as stewards of life on planet Earth is wanting. We haven’t been good stewards. We have environm ental, global problem s right now that are bringing civilization to a crisis. And people don’t want to hear that but it’s slowly becom ing obvious that that is true . And so, this knowledge of who we are, how we m anage a planet, how we fit into the larger sch em e of things, is a very im portant question. Well, Dr. Greer did indeed m ount an initiative and did go to Washington, did speak with high level Governm ent people, did present som e of the witnesses that we’ ve talked about here, to give briefings. He has asked for congressional heari ngs on these matters. I attended and helped him with that. And I believe it is a very im portant e ffort that we get congressional oversight of all of this. But so far, that hasn’ t happened. We briefed certain m embers of Congress, som e of their staff, som e of the people from the White House. We talked with people in the Pentagon. And in general, it was well received and som e were quite am azed at what they heard. But so far it hasn’ t resulted in any great activity . JF: Was this news to a lot of their ears? EM: To som e people, y es. Others, not really so m uch. But I will say , it led me to the belief that people in high level Governm ent have very , very little, if any , valid inform ation about this. Most have no m ore knowledge than the m an in the st reet. They were out of the loop of the things we were talking about, that’s right. JF: Is that a concern for y ou? EM: Oh y es, it’ s a very great concern. I have expressed this concern over and over. That is exactly what I’m say ing: whatever activity is going on, to the extent that it is a clandestine group, a quasi-Governm ent group, a quasi-private group, it is without any ty pe, as far as I can tell, of high level Governm ent oversight. And that is a great concern. [Astronaut Mitchell here is referring to the 1997 Briefings that Dr. Greer organized for Congress, White House personnel, the Pe ntagon and others. There were over a dozen government and military witnesses present who testified regarding what they personally had seen related to UFOs and ET matters. It was indeed disconcerting to see so many high government officials and senior Pentagon officers who had been kept in the dark about something as important as this. SG] 50 "},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" Testimony of Monsignor Corrado Balducci Septem ber 2000 [Through translator] Monsignor Balducci is a Vatican theologian and an insider close to the Pope. He has been featured on national Italian television num erous tim es to express that extraterrestrial contact is a real phenom enon and “not due to psy chological im pairm ent”. In this testim ony he explains that not only the general populace but also highly credible, cultured, and educated peopl e of high status are recognizing m ore and more that this is a real phenom enon. He goes on to speak about the extraterrestrial people as part of God’s creation and that they are not angels nor are they devils. However they are probably m ore spiritually evolved. CB: Monsignor Corrado Balducci SG: Dr. Steven Greer CB: ... We have com e to the point that we can’ t any more deny that there is som ething that is happening, that som ething is ha ppening here in this field of ufology , not just fly ing saucers, but there m ight be actual people, beings, extraterrestrial beings... I want to speak as a theologist right now. To be so skeptical is against norm al com mon sense, it’s against reason. Hum an testim ony is the m ost com mon way of com munication and dialogue. Because, when we listen to people, we have to have faith that what they are say ing is true. It’s a dialogue between one who say s som ething and believing what the person has to say , or not believing what the person has to say . But if we go ahead like this, and this is the real point that really m oved m e as a theologian, if we continue say ing this isn’t true, then wh at’s going to happen? Then whatever hum an witness testim ony we have for any thing else w ill not be given the im portance deserved to witness testim ony . And this witness testim ony , if it becom es dim inished will have a lot of negative repercussions: individual negative aspect s, social negative aspects, and religious aspects. And especially for what concerns the Christian religion... It’s also possible for another reason: God. G od in his wisdom wouldn’t have created only us as hum ans. SG: In Am erica, there have been som e reacti onary fundam entalists who have said that these are the work of the devil? What do y ou think of this? CB: The devil has nothing to do with this! I ha ven’t talked about this publicly in the past, but angels and devils don’ t need [ space] craft; they don’ t need the fly ing saucers. They don’ t need these things. God would never allow the devil to show hum anity this kind of manifestation in such a great form . He woul d never perm it this. Don’t even think about it being the devil... And it say s in the Bible, every thing that exists in the universe is in the creation divine. There are no extraterrestrials which are not part of the divine creation... 51 "},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" 52 "},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" 53 "},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" 54 "},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":" 55 "},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" 56 "},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":" 57 "},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" 58 "},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" 59 "},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" 60 "},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" 61 "},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"3.8.2 Radar / Pilot Cases Introduction (transcribed and edited from an oral present ation by Dr. Greer) This area of testim ony deals specifically with pilot encounters, radar cases and related cases. It should be pointed out that for decades, peopl e who have been skeptical of the UFO subject have asserted that if these objects were real, they would have been tracked on radar. We have no fewer than 20 witnesses from the Air Force, the Marines, the Navy , the Arm y, and civilian authorities in the United States and abroad who are qualified air traffic controllers and pilots who have seen and tracked these objects on radar. Pl ease note that these people state em phatically that these objects have not been weather balloons; they have not been air inversions; they have not been “swam p gas.” They have been structured craft often traveling at thousands of m iles per hour, then suddenly stopping, hovering or m oving in a nonlinear fashion. These objects have been tracked going from one spot to hundreds of m iles away or further within one radar sweep. These are solid objects. They are m etallic and th ey give strong and unam biguous radar returns. This is not a situation any m ore where we just have one or two witnesses, and one m ust consider this very seriously as y ou evaluate th e evidence: To have m ore than a dozen of these witnesses on tape testify ing that these objects have been tracked on radar, and at tim es as m any as a dozen radars tracking at the sam e tim e, m eans that we are dealing with an actual, real, phy sical and technological craft -- not som ething that is im aginary , not som ething that is a mass hallucination, and not som ething that can be written off as som e kind of anom aly . As Air Force Colonel Charles Brown pointed out, the Air Force Project Grudge, as far back as 1950, had radar confirm ation of these objects by ground radar, ground vi sual, airborne radar, and airborne visual – and, “It does not get any better than that.” Many of these witnesses have also observed these objects returning on m ultiple nights to sim ilar areas and have checked out their equipm ent rigorously to be sure that there were no technical g litches in either the software or the hardware. This of course is explosive. The testim ony of these witnesses forever puts to rest the argum ent that these objects don’ t exist because we ha ve, in addition to their testim ony , the radar tracings; we have docum entation of these events ; and we have people who have been on the inside of such events ranging from the 1940s all the way up into the 1990s. Testim ony of FAA Division Chief John Callahan October 2000 For 6 y ears Mr. Callahan was the Division Chief of the Accidents and Investigations Branch of the FAA in Washington DC. In his testim ony he tells about a 1986 Japanese Airlines 747 flight that was followed by a UFO for 31 m inutes over the Alaskan skies. The UFO also trailed a United Airlines flight until the flight landed. There was visual confirm ation as well as air-based and ground-based radar confirm ation. This event was significant enough for the then FAA Adm inistrator, Adm iral Engen, to hold a briefing the next day where the FBI, CIA, President Reagan’ s Scientific Study Team , as well as others attended. Videotape radar evidence, air traffic voice com munications and paper reports were com piled and presented. At the conclusion of this m eeting, the attending CIA members instructed every one present 62"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"that ‘the meeting never took place’ and that ‘this incident was never recorded’ . Not realizing that there was additional evidence, they confiscated just the evidence presented, but Mr. Callahan was able to secure video tape and audio evidence of the event. JC: FAA Division Chief John Callahan SG: Dr. Steven Greer JC: I was the Division Chief of the Accidents and Investigations Branch of the FAA in Washington, D.C. I stay ed there for about six y ears and then retired. This particular incident started with a phone ca ll from the people in Alaska. He say s, we got a problem here. I don’t know what to tell the m edia. The whole office is full of the m edia from Alaska. I said, what’ s the problem ? He said, well, it’ s that UFO. I said, what UFO? He said, well last week we had a UFO chase a 747 across the skies up here for about 30 minutes or so and we didn’ t think too m uch of it, he say s. But a pparently the word got out and we have all these news people here and we want to know what to tell them . So being an old Governm ent em ploy ee, I told him what y ou alway s tell him . Tell them it is under investigation and then get all that data together. I wanted all the discs that they had and all the tapes that they had available flown overnight to the [ FAA] tech center in Atlantic City . They called the military and they told the m ilita ry they wanted all their tapes. The FAA controls all the airspace above the United States and its territory . It doesn’ t belong to the military . It doesn’t belong to the guy s shooting th e rockets off. It belongs to the United States Governm ent and it is controlled by the FAA. So I told him to get the m ilitary ’s tapes and all their said, the m ilitary said they were short on their ta pes and they had to put them back in service, but it’s only been 12 day s. Now, the tapes were supposed to be kept for 15 day s. The FAA Adm inistrator sent m y boss, who was the associate director of the FAA, and m e down to Atlantic City to look at this thing to see if he had som ething to worry about. It took us two day s to look at all the data. We went in and told him we wanted this room set up to be just like it was in Anchorage [ during the encounter] . A nd we wanted all that data to com e to this radarscope. And we wanted to see every thing the controller saw. We wanted to hear every thing he heard. And we wanted it all tied together, the radar, the digital radar and the sound. Som e of the people that were working on that si de of the fence and who were display ing this, had already reviewed the tapes, and they didn’ t feel com fortable showing us what was on there. But we looked at all of it. When the Air Traffic Controller had asked the m ilitary m an, do y ou see any thing? The military guy say s, y es, I have a target at such and such, 1:00 and eight m iles from the Japanese pilot, 747. The way it started is there was a Japanese Airline 747, was com ing from the northwest going across the Alaskan territory . And he was at either 31,000, 33,000, or 35,000 feet. And it was around 11:00 at night, but you can check the real tim es. He called and asked the Controller if the Controller had any traffic at his altitude. And the Controller said, no. Basically it was a m idnight operation and they didn’t have too m uch traffic. And he said, well I have a target at my 11:00 or 1:00 position about eight m iles away . Now in the 747 they have radar in the nose that picks up the weather outside there. So his radar is picking up a target. He sees this target with his ey es. And the target, the way he 63"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"described it, was a huge ball with lights running around it. And I think he said it was like four tim es as big as a 747! And the m ilitary m an said som ething like, y eah, I see him 35 m iles north of Anchorage. And who’s that at 11:00 or 1:00 in his position? A nd the FAA Controller said, I don’t have any body [any regular traffic] ? Do y ou have any body ? The m ilitary controller said, it’s not m ine. ATC called the m ilitary controller and asked them if they had any body out there. And they said no, all their traffic was on the west side. And he cam e back and said, we have no traffic here. And a couple of tim es during the operation, the Japanese pilot would say , he’ s now at 11:00, he’s now at 1:00, he’s now at 3:00. The UFO was bouncing around the 747 here. And when he would say that, the m ilitary guy would cu t in and say , he’s now at 2:00 or 3:00 and he would confirm the position. The m ilitary controller has, what they call, height-finding radar, and they have long-range radar and shor t-range radar. So if they don’t catch it on one of their system s they catch it on the other. And if y ou listen to the m ilitary m an, at one tim e he said, I have it on the height radar, or m y range radar, which indi cated that they had a target on his sy stem . Well they ran through for the best part of 31 m inutes. The UFO would be in one position or the other following the Japanese 747. After a while they cha nged his altitude and it still stay ed with him . They gave him a 360. When y ou are a 747 and y ou m ake a 360, it takes y ou a few m inutes to turn around. You cover a lot of space. And it still stay ed with him . It was either in the front, on the side, or behind him . They would see it at 1:00 in front of the 747 seven or eight miles [away ]. And then on the next sweep, which would be like 10 seconds later, it would be behind him , seven or eight m iles. And it alway s stay ed seven or eight m iles away from the target. [Note the familiar non-linear maneuvers of this UFO, covering many miles in less than 10 seconds. This is corroborated by dozens of oth er UFO-radar events in the testimony of many other witnesses. SG] When it was all done and we went back to Wash ington the next day , the Adm inistrator [ of the FAA] had called down and wanted to know if he had a problem or not. And m y boss had told him , well we took a video of it and it looks like there m ight have been som ething there. Well the FAA Adm inistrator said can y ou com e up and give us a quick five-m inute run-down of what happened? So we go up to the 10 th floor [ of FAA Headquarters in Washington DC] and give a four or five m inute debriefing for the Adm inistrator who was at the tim e Adm iral Engen. He said, well have y ou got that video with y ou? Can you show me the video? I said, y eah, y ou just plug it in and play it. So we plugged it in for him . He started watchi ng it and after about five m inutes, he told his staff to cancel his m eetings. So he watched the whole thing, just over a half an hour. We get all done, and he say s, what do y ou guy s think? My boss gave a good political answer and he said he wasn’t sure what it was... So hi s take was, don’t talk to any body . And don’t talk to any body until I give y ou the okay . Then the next day I got a call from som eone with the Scientific Study Group [for President Reagan] , or th e CIA, I’m not sure who it was, the first call. And they had som e questions about the incide nt. And I had said, I don’t know what you are talking about; y ou probably want to call the Adm iral [ FAA Adm inistrator Engen] . Well a few minutes later the Adm iral calls down and say s, I have set up a briefing tom orrow morning at 9:00 am in the round room . Bring all the stuff you have. Bring every body up there and give them whatever they want. We want to get out of it. Just let them do whatever they want. So I brought all the people from the Tech Ce nter. We had all kinds of boxes of data that 64"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"we had them print out; it filled up the room . They brought in three people from the FBI, three people from the CIA, and three people from Reagan ’s Scientific Study team -- I don’t know who the rest of the people were but they were all excited. We let them watch the video. Then they had all kinds of questions about the frequency , the rate of the antennae turning, on and on and on, how m any radar’s, how m any antennas, how does the data get processed. They were all excited -- th e only way a m an would be if that was his job. When they got done, they actually swore all these other guy s in there that this never took place. We never had this m eeting. A nd this was never recorded. SG: Who said that? Who was say ing that? JC: This was one of the guy s from the CIA. Ok ay? That they were never there and this never happened. At the tim e I said, well I don’t know why you are say ing this. I m ean, there was som ething there and if it’s not the stealth bom ber, then y ou know, it’s a UFO. And if it’s a UFO, why wouldn’t y ou want the people to know? Oh, th ey got all excited over that. You don’t even want to say those words. He said this is the first tim e they ever had 30 m inutes of radar data on a UFO. And they are all itching to get their hands onto the data and to find out what it is and what really goes on. He say s if they com e out and to ld the Am erican public that they ran into a UFO out there, it would cause panic across the country . So therefore, y ou can’t talk about it. And they are going to take all this data. So I said, okay , take all the data if that’s what y ou want. SG: Who took that data? JC: Well, that group. I don’t know who it went to, but that group took it. But they took only what we had there. They didn’t ask m e if th ere was any thing else that I had. They said, they are taking all this data. And I said, fine. Now, I had the original video that I took and I had the pilot’s report that cam e through, the first report. And I had the FAA’s first report that was all downstairs on m y table. They didn’t ask for that so I didn’t give it to them . And later on when I retired, that was the stuff that was in m y office and all that cam e with m e. And we’ve been sitting on it ever since. [We have obtained all of these materials, including the radar video, ATC voice transcripts, the FAA report, and the computer printouts of the event. SG] At the end, the Japanese 747 is leaving the ai rspace, and there’ s a United Airlines flight com ing up to land in Alaska. The Controller say s to the United, we’ ve got a Japanese 747 up here and he’ s being chased, followed, by a UFO and we’ d like y ou to check him out. Can we leave you at that altitude? And the United say s, fine , or sure. And so they give him a left turn, 20 degrees or so, keep him at his altitude and they kind of run him in toward the Japanese 747. Once the two airplanes pass, that target [ UFO] follows the United down through the airspace until he gets on final approach and then the UFO just disappears. Well when they read the reports that cam e through the FAA decided it had to protect them selves -- y ou can’t say you saw a target, even though this is what he said. So they m ade him change his report to say “position sy mbols,” which m akes it sound like it wasn’t really a target. Well if it’s not a target then a lot of the other position sy mbols that we are separating [ on radar] aren’t targets either. And when I read that, I thought oh, there is som ething fishy here, that som ebody is worried about som ething or other and they are try ing to cover up. 65"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" When the CIA told us that this never happene d and we never had this m eeting, I believe it was because they didn’ t want the public to know that this was going on. Norm ally we would put out som e ty pe of a news release that such and such happened. And I think it was mysterious that the m ilitary tapes disappeared. It wasn’t right. We went from 30 day s to 15 day s [for the tim e period re quired to keep radar tapes] . And the first indication makes it look like it, the m ilitary , knew m ore than we did about who the visitors were and they didn’t want any body else to know. And of course the people that are involved at the lower levels don’t really know what is going on above them . When som eone calls up and say s put those tapes back in service, they just put th em back in service. They really don’t care. When they asked m e what I thought I told them that it looked like we had a UFO that was up there. The reason it wasn’ t [consistently ] on the FAA’ s tapes was because it was too large of an aircraft, and it was picked up as weather, so we wouldn’ t record it. [The sy stem is program med to filter out such things] . The pilot, the Japanese pilot did see it. The Japanese pilot drew pictures of it. Eventually they gave the Japanese pilot a hard tim e because of what he said. He was em barrassing his country . [The tragedy of this JAL 747 pilot is a poignant reminder of the power of ridicule in keeping this subject secret. The pilot was forced to take a desk job for a prolonged period and was humiliated. See the testimony of former NASA research scientist Dr. Richard Haines regarding his knowledge of the event and how he he lped get the pilot flying again. SG] Our military controllers said they had seen it. Our FAA controllers said they had seen it. Our FAA controllers, after a period of tim e, cam e back and said they really didn’ t see a target, that they saw som ething else, which m akes it sound like som ebody is helping them fill out their reports. And that looked suspicious. But who do y ou tell that y ou were involved in a UFO incident without them looking at y ou like y ou ain’t wrapped too tight? And this I thi nk is the way our country is set up now. The only ones that see a UFO in the TV program s are the rednecks out in the country that are going coon hunting or alligator hunting at night. You don’t fi nd any body with any kind of sm arts or som e professional individual say ing hey , last night let m e tell y ou what I saw. They don’ t display that in the United States. So if y ou talk about seeing a UFO, y ou are putting y ourself in a funny kind of category . That’s probably one of the reasons why you don’t hear about it any more. But as far as I’ m concerned, I saw a UFO chase a Japanese 747 across the sky for over half an hour on radar. And it’s faster than any thing that I know of in our Governm ent. Well, I’ ve been involved in a lot of cover-ups with the FAA. When we gave the presentation to the Reagan staff I was behind the group that w as there. And when they were speaking to the people in the room , they had all those people swear that this never happened. But they never had me swear it never happened. And it alway s bothe red m e that we have these things going on and when you see som ething or you hear som ething on the radio or TV, the news, that it’ s put down as it’s not there. I have a hard tim e say ing nothing. It still bothers m e that I’ ve seen all this, I know all this, and I’ m walking around with the answer, and nobody wants to ask the question to get the answer. And it kind of irritates m e a little bit. And I don’t believe our Governm ent should be set up that way . I think when we have som ething like this, that y ou can probably find out m ore about what’s going on in the world [by not covering it up] . If they [the UFO’s] can travel that far, that distance with that type of 66"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"machinery , who knows what they could do here for the health of the nation, the people, the food they could give them , the cancers we could cure. Th ey have to know m ore than us to be able to travel at that speed. For those people that say that if these UFO’ s existed, they would som e day be on radar and that there’ d be professionals who would see it, then I can tell them that back in 1986 there were enough professional people that saw it. It was br ought down to headquarters, FAA headquarters, Washington D.C. The Adm inistrator saw the tape of it. The people that we were debriefing, they ’ve all seen. Reagan’ s Scientific Study team , three of those professors, doctors, they ’ve seen it. As far as I was concerned they were the ones that verified m y own thoughts about it. They were very , very excited about the data. They ha d said that this was the only tim e a UFO was ever recorded on radar for any length of tim e where it is 30 som e m inutes. And they have all this data to look at. Now a 30-m inute radar return filled up boxes acr oss the room , and the boxes were stacked, you know, two or three high. There was a lot of paper there to look at. They knew the frequency now of the radar. They knew how fast it turned. They knew where it was. They had the m ilitary that confirm ed it. And yet I think the way the Governm ent wants the outside people to view those that have seen som ething like this is like they are kooks, like they ’re not wrapped too tight. And y ou’ ve got to watch out for them . That’ s the im age that they put out. I guess I really don’ t care about the im age... SG: Do you recall the nam es of the CIA people and others at this m eeting at FAA Headquarters? JC: When I gave him m y card the CIA guy said, “y ou know, we are with the com pany (they don’t say CIA). In the com pany , we don’t have cards. We don’t have com pany cards.” They may have a card, but it’s nothing to do with the com pany . And he said that there’ s nothing we can give out. On the Adm iral’ s calendar, they should have who reserve d the room and who was there for the day of the briefing. What I can tell you is what I’ve seen with m y own ey es. I’ ve got a videotape. I’ ve got the voice tape. I’ve got the reports that were filed that will confirm what I’ve been telling y ou. And I’m one of those, what y ou would call the high Governm ent officials in the FAA. I was a Division Chief. I was only three or four down from the Adm iral. We investigated all the airline incidents, all the accidents. [Indeed those who would say that these objects are not real because there is no proof of them recorded on radar and being analyzed by competent professionals, can now stand corrected. Presented here is a very senior FAA official sta ting on the record that the event happened and that the CIA and other Government officials or dered the event be kept secret and who confiscated (or so they thought) the evidence. W e are profoundly grateful for the courage shown by Mr. Callahan in coming forward and in preserving and conveying the evidence of this case.

Chuck Sorrells, US Air Force (ret.) Decem ber 2000 Chuck Sorrells is a career Air Force m ilitary m an who was at Edwards Air Force Base in 1965 when not one, but at least seven UF Os appeared over Edwards Air Force Base airspace, moving in extraordinary fashion at enorm ous speeds, m aking right-hand turns and other m aneuvers which no known aircraft was capable of at the tim e. They appeared on multiple radars, were seen visually by several people, and a special UFO officer scram bled and authorized a jet to in tercept these objects. This event lasted for five or six hours. An edited transcript of the audio tape of the event follows his testim ony . CS: Sgt. Chuck Sorrells SG: Dr. Steven Greer CS: My nam e is Chuck Sorrells. I went into the Air Force in 1954 and retired in 1974. I was a Tech Sergeant. Most of the tim e I was an Air Traffic Controller. I’ ve been at Edwards Air Force Base in California, and in Japan, Thailand, Alaska, and several places in the states. This event happened October the 7 th of 1965 at Edwards Air Force Base. It was on a midnight shift and I was the Air Traffic Controller on duty in the tower. At about 1:30 or so in the morning, I noticed this real bright light to the east of m y tower. It was a light green and it had a red light underneath it. The red light was a pul sating ty pe light, and it had a white light on top that just glowed. It was very bright and quite large. I observed it for quite a while, because there wasn’ t any aircraft in the area at the tim e. I called the dispatcher down at the base operations and the weatherm an that was on duty that night (the forecaster), and got them all to go outside and take a look. I had one of the guy s from the inte rceptor detachm ent that was on the base look also, and I had the captain down there look. We talk ed about it for a while, and the RAP-CON people (that’ s radar people on the base) didn’ t have any aircraft in the area at the tim e. We called it down to the Air Defense people at Los Angeles defense sector. The director down there called around to his sites, and at one point in tim e they had at least four different radar sites that were getting radar returns on it. [ The UFOs] were getting seen at a couple of other towers, like George Tower, and there were a c ouple of other places that were seeing them . So, there were several people on the ground looking at these UFOs, and about four radar sites [looking at them ]. This [ went] back and forth and back and forth for two or three hours. They finally decided to scram ble an aircraft on it, to go up and take a look at it. This was coordinated with the other, higher headquarters, and I think NORAD was involved. [See the testimony of military air traffic controller Michael Smith regarding NORAD being involved in this unambiguous UFO case, their denials notwithstanding. SG] The jet [ went] up to take a look at it, and they tried to run him in to intercept these targets. At the very beginning, I had one — the big, large light. Som e tim e later, it was just sitting there, mostly stationary , but it was too close to the horizon to be a star or any thing like that. It was down below the m ountains [ and] the hills and stuff, so it wasn’t a star, [ and] I couldn’t correlate for what it could possibly be. Then, all of a sudde n, there [ were] three m ore objects, and they had sim ilar characteristics as far as the lighting [was] concerned. But these three stay ed together. They stay ed in a form ation and stay ed together, and then m oved down to the south of me and sat there, stationary , for a while. A little later on, three m ore appear[ed] , but these three [were] 76"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"individual ones. They would fly individually around and go north, south, east, west — a lot of maneuvers. At this point I had seven of them at one tim e. This is when they decided to scram ble the jet interceptor. It was getting way up in the early m orning hours by that tim e. They were having no luck intercepting these UFOs . They kept asking m e, in the tower, where was this object in relation to the airplane? The only thing I could do was line him up with my runway , where I knew what heading he was on in relation to where I was. Then, as soon as he’d get to the end of the runway , I’d tell him to turn to a certain heading and head straight forward. Well, about three different tim es that night, he’d say “contact”, and that “contact” m eans he had contact with som ething on his radar in the cockpit of the aircraft. What it was, we don’t know to this day . But they were real. At one point in tim e the interceptor was up to 40,000 feet. When he went near the object, the object just rose real fast, real sudden, straight up, and he just went under it. There’ s a place on the tape where the Director say s, “How’s he looking, tower?” And I said, he’s low. He [ replied] , “Well, he’s at 40,000 feet,” and I said, I don’t care — he’s still low. [The tape he refers to is an audiotape of the actual conversations of this hours-long encounter. We have this tape. Refer to the transcript of this tape below. SG] That UFO just went way high. They searched on their radar, the height finders, and every thing for it. I highly suspect it was above their radars at that point. SG: How high would that be? CS: Probably 100,000 feet or som ething like that. 80,000 to 100,000 feet was probably their capability back in those day s. The interceptor did have contact about three different tim es, and then he’ d lose it. These objects play ed around there for the rem ainder of m y shift. About day light, the UFOs started getting higher and higher and higher in the atm osphere. By the tim e it was light enough that y ou wouldn’ t see the rest of the stars, they were gone too — they just disappeared into the atm osphere. I know craft of all ty pes, so I know a lot of things this was not. I know it was not a helicopter. I know it was not an airplane. I know it was not a balloon--a weather balloon or any other ty pe of balloon. I know it was no known aircra ft or fly ing object that we know of today , or at that tim e. And it wasn’ t a laser show. It wasn’ t any thing like that, but they could move real fast. They could be to the east of m y field, and then in just a short period of tim e they could be to the west. They could probably go 30-40 m iles in the tim e y ou could snap y our fingers twice. I mean, just fast! And they could rise — just go straight up. It seem ed like they could do that instantaneously . At som e points they would hover and just sit for a long period of tim e — then they would m ove. The sm aller three individual ones had a lot m ore movem ent than the other ones. The original very large UFO didn’t m ove all that m uch. After a couple of hours, though, it moved a little bit from the east, down a little bit towa rd the south, and then m oved back toward the east a little bit again — like that. But it didn’ t m ake any sudden, fast m ovem ents until they tried to run an intercept on it, and then it went straight up. The three that were fly ing around individually w ould dart north, south, east, [ and] west, and they were the ones that really went fast. They were the ones that were act ually nearer to the base and nearer to the ground. I judged that their altitude would be around 2,000 feet or less at tim es. 77"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"I know that we were getting radar cuts on them . I’d find a cut any where from 4,000 to 10,000 [or] 11,000 feet. So, that’ s pretty low to the surface. These UFOs had to be som ething that would re turn a radar signal, and that had to be som ething solid and m etal. Radar is a very sim ple thing: it’s a radio beam that hits som ething, bounces off som ething, and com es back. So, it ha d to be som ething the radar would bounce off, and it wouldn’t bounce off a rubber balloon or any thing like that. It would have to be som ething with a m etallic nature that would cause it to boun ce back and m ake an indication on y our radar screen. SG: Can y ou estim ate the speed of these objects? CS: It would have to be in the thousands of m iles per hour — up in that area, speed wise. These things would have to be very , very fast. The radar people were having a hard tim e determ ining [their] speed because they ’d be in one place and they ’d sit for a little while, and then they ’d m ove real fast. By the tim e the radar screen got around to finding them , the UFO was already at another location. It was very difficult to get any kind of a speed on them . You could be watching one in the east, and if you looked around for a little bit, if y our attention was diverted som eplace else for just a m inute, y ou’ d look back and he’ d be over in the west. They could make quick turns and had all sorts of m aneuverability th at we didn’t know any thing about at the tim e. It was a very strange evening. These events happened over at least a four-hour tim efram e. In those day s, every base had what they called a UFO officer — an unidentified fly ing object officer. We had one, and he was the guy that actually gave the order to take a look at this thing. The Air Defense Director for the Los Angeles defense sector and the radar controllers wanted to take a look at it, but they had to get his say -so before they could go ahead and do it legally . At that point in tim e at Edwards Air Force Base, we had a rocket site. They were experim enting with a whole lot of different fuel com binations, and they were doing a lot of rocket burns over there just to see what thrust they could get. From m y standpoint, that looked like the area where this huge UFO was just sitting — just about over that rocket site. The F-106 that they did scram ble that night was what they call a cold bird. It wasn’t arm ed in any w ay. SG: During y our Air Force career, did y ou hear of other people having these types of encounters with UFOs? CS: Yes, there were. I’ve heard guy s talk about seeing things like that, but they wouldn’ t necessarily com e forward and say what they ha d seen, because they didn’ t want the stigm a attached to them that they were crazy or they were seeing things. Or they didn’ t want the ribbing that they were going to get from their buddies. The tape that is in existence now of the even t that night is m ade up of radio patches and telephone patches that were recorded at the various radar sites that were involved. There would be another tape as well, som eplace, from the to wer that I was in, because every thing that was going on in the tower [was] recorded. The [largest num ber of] objects that I saw at any one tim e was seven. There was one large one, and then there [were] three sm aller ones with the sam e ty pe characteristics, but these three 78"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"kind of stay ed together. At a certain point after this, there were three other ones that were fly ing around individually , but at one point, I had as m any as seven, visually , at one tim e. From hearing the tapes now, I hear that there m ight have been as m any as 11 in the area that night. I can’t tell y ou what [ they were] , but I can te ll y ou a lot of things [ they weren’t] . [ There isn’t] any thing that we know of today that has those ty pes of characteristics — could do the maneuvers and do the speed, with no sound. At so me points, they were close enough to the tower that if it had been a jet or som ething, I would have heard the sound from it. I wish I knew what they were... [This extremely important case involves a sea soned Air Force Air Traffic Controller, an official “UFO officer”, 4 separate radar st ations, lock-on from on-board radar on a jet interceptor, many hours, and many objects over several hours. The debunkers and those who would ridicule the UFO matter need to be able to explain away all of these elements--and the voice tape of the actual event. The only conc lusion is the obvious one: these UFOs were real and were not swamp gas, ball lightning, hallucinations , or any of the other absurd explanations offered by academia and officialdom for these events.

Smith, US Air Force Novem ber 2000 Michael Sm ith was an Air Traffic Controller with the Air Force in Oregon and, subsequently , in Michigan. At both of these facilities he and others witnessed UFOs tracked on radar and m oving at extraordinary speeds. He also confirm s that personnel were expected to m aintain secrecy concer ning these observations, and that NORAD, the North Am erican Air Defense Com mand, was fully apprised of these events. In fact, in one event in Michigan, NORAD was fully enga ged, and steered B-52s returning to base around these UFOs. My nam e is Michael W. Sm ith. I was in the Air Force from 1969 to 1973 and was an Aircraft Control and Early Warning Operator, whic h was basically an Aircraft Control person. Our job was to track and give altitudes for m ilita ry aircraft, and to detect and identify any incom ing aircraft com ing into our airspace. In spring of 1970, while I was stationed in Klam ath Falls, Oregon. I cam e up to the radar site on the evening shift, and where there [were] norm ally two or three people in the radar room , there [were] quite a few, from the cooks to m aintenan ce — all kinds of people. I asked what was going on, and they said that they were watching a UFO on radar. I im mediately was stunned and asked if the Pentagon [ had been] notified or if we [ had] called the President. They said no, they don’t do that. And I said, well, we should call the ne ws m edia or, y ou know, call som ebody — this was Earth-shaking news to m e. And they said, “No, just calm down.” NORAD [North Am erican Air Defense Com mand] knows about it. They had called NORAD. The senior NCO pulled m e to the side and said that NORAD knows about it — that’s the only people we notify . We don’t talk about this. We don’t tell any body about this. The people that know, know. We just watch, see what ha ppens, and that’ s it. That’ s our job. I insisted there has to be a report filed or som ething filed, y ou know? And he said that there is a report that y ou can file — it’s about an inch thick, and the first two pages are about the sighting. The rest of it is basically a psy chological profile of y ou, y our fam ily , y our bloodlines, every thing. When the Air Force goes through it, they can di scredit y ou com pletely by either say ing that [you were] on drugs, or y our m other was a com muni st, or any thing to discredit y ou. You’d never get a prom otion, and [ you’d] spend the next thr ee and one-half y ears up at the North Pole, living in a tent, checking the weather balloons. You know — no hope for prom otion. So, the message was pretty loud and clear: y ou just shut-up and don’t say any thing to any body . This UFO was stationary , wasn’t m oving at all. Then it would slowly lower itself down until it got behind a m ountain so that y ou lost radar c ontact. It would stay down for about 15 m inutes, and the next thing y ou knew, it was right back up there at 80,000 [ or] 90,000 feet. Then, [ in] the next sweep of the radarscope, it would be 200 m iles away , stationary — com pletely stopped. It would hover there for 5 [ or] 10 m inutes, and then slowly start descending until it dropped off radar. Then it would com e back up. It did this three tim es, that I saw. This happened one m ore tim e that I know of. I heard that it’s not an infrequent occurrence out there. They have them quite often, but I’ ve personally seen it twice. 87"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"There’ s no aircraft that can accelerate and deceler ate that fast without having the pilot’ s face go through the windshield. I m ean it is im possible to operate that way with gravity ... So, it was obviously som ething we didn’t have. We neve r scram bled interceptors on them , so it was obviously som ething the Russians never had. It was a UFO. That’s the only explanation there was for it. NORAD knew about it and they just handled it like it’s just a UFO — watch it and see what happens. Don’t take any actions, don’t te ll any body , don’t write it down, and don’t disclose it. NORAD is in charge of all of the air space of th e United States and North Am erica. It’ s their job to identify any incom ing aircraft, any threats — Ru ssian planes or any aircraft at all. The first thing they do is check it with the flight plans of airlines or private carriers or whatever. Every thing is identified, so when som ething like this just pops up on the scope with no flight plan and doing erratic behaviors, it’s their job to iden tify it. They have a tie-in with all the radar stations in North Am erica. It all goes to Chey enne Mountain, CO [ NORAD HQ] . They have a big screen and they can see any area of the country at any tim e. Another experience I had happened on third shif t. I was on the radar, and NORAD called m e and inform ed me that there was a UFO com ing up the California coast and it would be in m y area pretty soon. I said what do y ou want m e to do? And they said, “Nothing, just watch it, don’t write it down.” We have a log book in which we are supposed to keep track of any thing out of the ordinary . But they said, “Don’t log it or any thing, just watch it. We are just letting y ou know — heads up.” NORAD was well aware, obviously , that these UFOs were around, and the action of the people when I first saw the UFO on radar was as if it happens quite often. The first tim e y ou see a UFO on radar y ou realize the Governm ent knows about this, so why aren’ t they telling the press? But when I was pulled to the side, it was explai ned that, y es, there are UFOs. Yes, we know [about] them . Yes, NORAD knows about them . But that’ s it. This is a secret. You are not supposed to talk about it. Don’t tell any body about it. Don’t m ake any reports. Don’t write it down. Just shut-up and y ou’ll get y our next st ripe, and y ou’ll be prom oted, and we’ll go on from there. Another encounter happened while I was statione d in Michigan. It was in 1972 — I believe it was in the fall of 1972. I was working alone that night. By then I was prom oted to a Sergeant. I got a phone call from the switchboard operator, a nd he said he had the State Police on the phone and they wanted to talk to m e. He was real frantic when he got on the phone, and said that there [were] three UFOs over the north tower of the Mackinac Bridge. Mackinac Bridge connects the upper peninsula and the lower peninsula of Michigan. I im mediately turned on the radar, but m y im mediate reply to the officer was [that] they are not on radar, and I hung up the phone. It’s just so mething that’s program med into y ou — that’s what y ou are supposed to say , “There’ s nothing on radar”, even if y ou see som ething. But actually , the north tower seem ed to be a little bit bi gger, and then I realized that they were the UFOs. One took off, left the other two, circ led Mackinac Island and cam e back to the other [two] . Then all three started going along Interstate 75, north from St. Ignace. In the m eantim e, I got calls from the Sheriff’ s Departm ent. They were frantic, say ing, “We are chasing these UFOs up the highway .” My response was, there’ s nothing on radar. Several 88"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"people called — several civilians. I believe ther e was a newspaper person that called. In the meantim e, I called NORAD and told them . They looked it up and they said, “Oh, they are going up I-75?” I said y es, at about 70-80 m iles an hour. Now, about halfway between St. Ignace and [ uni ntelligible] , there is Kincheloe Air Force Base, which is a SAC base [ closed in 1977] . They have B-52 bom bers. They had two that were on final approach, and that crosses I-75. Appare ntly , they diverted those two bom bers because they didn’t want — [whether] they have nuclear weapons or not — to take a chance on them meeting UFOs about the sam e altitude, crossing the highway . So they diverted the two B-52s. As the UFOs cam e closer, I realized that they were com ing this way — following the highway right by m y radar site, which is up on top of a hill. Then I saw a bright bluish glow go by silently , followed by the flashing red and blue lights of the police cars that were chasing them . If I had said, oh, y es, I have them on radar, then the next thing I know, newspapers are going to be up there wanting to talk to me and I’d probably get courtm artialed... It was just instinct, say ing there’ s nothing on radar when there actually was. I was watching them com e up the highway . They were so close together, they looke d like one return. In other words, it looked like it was one aircraft and it was very low. It doesn’t m atter if he’s weari ng a badge or not — y ou don’t talk about it. In the log book, [I] wrote this down, and I told m y Senior NCO the next day about it — but that’s all y ou are supposed to do. Don’t tell any body else. Don’t write it down, although I did write it down. But, I doubt y ou’ll ever find that log book. The governm ent, they cover up. They don’t want any body talking about it. But this is such rem arkable technology . These people com e from who knows where. I would think you’ d want every body to know... On a personal note, after the first event happened in Oregon, I cam e hom e on leave and told my Dad about it. He was red, white, and bl ue through and through--an old WWII hero and all that, and very patriotic. I was explaining to him about these UFOs that we routinely see out there, and he said, “No, the Governm ent say s that ther e are no UFOs.” I’ m say ing, Dad, I’ ve seen these on radar with m y own ey es. And he say s, com e on, the Governm ent would ne ver lie to him . You know? But here’s his son; I would never lie to him . So, he just didn’t know what to do. It wasn’t until y ears later, until after Watergate, that he said, “Hey , sit down and tell m e about this. The Governm ent is ly ing to m e about a little thing like Watergate, so obviously they are out ly ing about som ething big.” It’s a Governm ent cover-up that doesn’t need to be here any m ore. There is no m ore Cold War. I believe the sam e thing Dr. Greer does, that the technology they have could enable us to stop burning our fossil fuels and stop the dam age to the ozone, etc. These people have technologies — they m ust have som ething. A nd the Governm ent knows about it. They have these aliens, they have these spacecraft, they have th is technology , all this. There’ s a lot of back- engineered technology , that’s pretty obvious. Who are they to cover this up when other Governm ents are com ing forward, adm itting, and showing their files — why isn’t our Governm ent? 89"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"While I was in the Air Force, there were a num ber of other people that had witnessed UFOs on radar, also.

Testimony of Commander Graham Bethune, US Navy (retired) Novem ber 2000 Cm dr. Graham Bethune is a retired Navy com mander pilot with a top-secret clearance. He was a VIP Plane Com mander who flew most of the high-ranking officers and civilians from Washington D.C. In his testim ony he explains how he was fly ing a group of VIP’ s and other pilots into Arge ntia, Newfoundland when they all witnessed a 300 foot UFO that traveled 10,000 feet straight up in a fraction of a second toward their plane and was on radar. He has docum ented th e event extensively . A selection of those docum ents follow this testim ony . GB: Cm dr. Graham Bethune SG: Dr. Steven Greer [Note that this case is also described in section 6.5. It occurred on Feb. 10, 1951. SG] GB: My nam e is Graham Bethune. I am a com mander, retired pilot from the Navy and I went through the regular Navy program of trai ning pilots. I graduated in 1943 from Pensacola, the Academ y Air. And of course all Navy pilots are trained navigators, which is very im portant when y ou are going to talk about what we’ re going to discuss here, because we had to know all of the star system s and we had to know these ty pes of things. I navigated m aybe 13 y ears around the planet with the stars. And when I first graduated from Pensacola in 1943 I went to the South Atlantic and we were hunting Germ an subm arines. This was all night fly ing. Every thing we did was at night in patrol planes. I was transferred to Air Transport Squadron On e in 1950. I was sent to Keflavik, Iceland, along with two other officers after a m eeting that they had in Washington, D.C., where Iceland was involved in seeing UFOs over Keflavik, Iceland, and they wanted troops up there to protect them . During our meeting they were explaining to us why they had requested the troops and what they were seeing. And we asked them if they could really go into m ore detail about the ty pe of craft that they were seeing. And their explanation was that they were seeing m ost of them at night -- lighted craft, circular. And we knew com ing from a naval air test center, we tested every thing there, that we had nothing like that that we had tested. 90"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" So I asked them , well, what did our governm ent tell y ou that they were? And they said, you’re governm ent said they were experim ental, probably experim ental Russian bom bers (laughter). The flight was norm ally about ten hours. But this particular night we had a 16-knot head wind. And about m aybe 300 to 400 m iles outside of Argentia, Newfoundland I saw som ething below the horizon, on the water, that looked like appr oaching a city at night. It was just kind of an am bient light, no definition whatsoever. But it looked like the sam e thing that you would see if y ou were approaching a large city at night. So I watched it for a while. It was about 1:00 am . And then finally I called Kinden’ s attention to it, who was sitting in the right seat. He was route checking m e. And he took a look at it and he didn’t know what it was. We couldn’t figure out ... there was nothing out there. We had passed over the guard ship already . In those day s, they had a guard ship that was between Icela nd and between Newfoundland. The guard ship had given us the latest weather. The weather was clear. There was no Northern Light activity , which they give as part of the weather report. And we had ship plots. There were no ships plotted in that area. So we asked control if he could give us another fix and find out if we were really on course. We thought m aybe we had drifted, that we were seeing Labrador or m aybe the tip of Greenland. So he said, no, we were right on course. So we watched it for a while and we were dr ifting to the right of it. Our heading was 222 degrees, 225 degrees. We were at 10,000 feet, I would say it was 40 miles away originally . When we were about 25 or 30 m iles away we c ould see defined lights and there was a pattern on the water. So, with that pattern we couldn’t figure out what was going on. May be the Navy was doing som ething that was highly classified, recovering som ething down in the ocean or som ething of this nature, we thought. And it was a circular pattern. And it was very large. So I sent the crew chief back to get the other plane com mander, Al Jones, because they wanted to land at Argentia. There were 31 passe ngers and we had two VIP crews that had pilots also, and patrol plane pilots. And at the tim e th at they cam e forward, the lights went out on the water. There was nothing on the water. This was about 15 m iles away . I m ean it was just dark. Now standing behind m e was the navigator, the radiom an, and also the plane captain – the cockpit was full. All of a sudden we saw, on the wa ter, a y ellow halo that was very , very sm all, about 15 m iles away . And it cam e up to 10,000 feet like that – a fraction of a second. [Note the similarity of movement of this UFO with other accounts: It covered 15 miles in a second or so. SG] And I thought that it was going to go right through us. So I disengaged the autopilot, pushed the nose over, because I was going to go under it at the angle that it was com ing toward m e. So what happened, the m inute that I did that, it was up at our altitude and I could see nothing outside of the cockpit but this craft. And so I didn’t know which way to go. And then all of a sudden I heard a racket. I didn’t know what it was. And I said, Fred, what the hell was that? He looked around and he said, every one was ducking in th e back of us and they collided and they are all ly ing on the deck back there, scram bling on the deck. So when I looked back it wasn’t there. And he said, it’s over here on the right hand side. Now it was about a mile or so away . It kind of drifted forward, maybe to a position five m iles away , and that’ s where it stay ed with us for quite som e tim e. 91"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" This is when we could first see it wasn’ t above our altitude. It was below our altitude. But it was still above the horizon where y ou could see the si de of the craft. You could see the dom e and you could see the color around the perim eter of the craft. And then we knew that it was a friendly encounter. We knew that it knew that we were there. We knew that it cam e out to see us. But we didn’ t think at that tim e that the reason that it did this was because they wanted to show us what the Icelanders were talking about. So we watched it for a while. And Al say s, well, let him get in the seat. So I let him get in the seat and he disengaged the autopilot and was going to chase it. Now we had a head wind of about 60-knots, so our ground speed was only m aybe 120, 130-knots. And so he wasn’t going to go too far in chasing this thing. But he did turn to chase it. So I decided that I would go back to see how the passengers reacted and also talk to the doctor who was back there. And so I went to him first, I said, Doc, did you see what we saw? And he said, y eah, he looked m e straight in the ey e and said, y eah, it was a fly ing saucer. He say s, I didn’ t look at it because I don’ t believe in such things. Well, it took m e a couple of seconds to realize what he was say ing. He couldn’ t believe, being a psy chiatrist, in that kind of thing. So I went back forward and I said, Al, whatever y ou do don’t tell any body we saw any thing, they will lock us up as soon as we get on the ground. He say s, it’s too late. I just called Gander control, to see if they could track this by radar. So that’ s how the story got out. So when we landed at Argentia, the Air Force was there and they interrogated us. And the captain that did the interrogation did a real good job. But y ou could tell this wasn’t his first tim e that he had ever interrogated any body as far as this ty pe of encounter was concerned. He made a good report, which went to the headquarters of the Air Force in Washington, D.C. Initially the color was y ellow. Since then I’ ve learned from the boy s upstairs why we saw different colors as it was com ing toward us. The colors were around the perim eter. And it turned from a y ellow to an orange to alm ost a fiery red and then alm ost a purplish red. And they said that that had to do with the am ount of energy be ing used or dissipated. It had to do with the power so to speak. And so when it slowed down, close to us, in a fraction of a second, it was back to the y ellow range. And it was foggy around it to where it was like a plasm a mist or som ething of this nature. When we were asked about the crafts size 300 feet cam e to m y m ind. And when I got the report out of the Archives in 1991 I had never seen any body else’ s report, every one said it was any where from 250 to 350 feet in diam eter. And when I talked to the others they said it was just som ething that they knew and estim ated. Now th e velocity when it left us was estim ated from between 1,000 m iles an hour to 2,000 m iles an hour. And when I looked at the report, Al Jones had estim ated 1,800 m iles an hour. Mine was 1,000. Another was 1,500 m iles, but in that range. It turns out that the radar report, which I have never seen said it was 1,800 m iles an hour We had nothing that would go that fast. And of c ourse I was at the naval air test center. This is where we had our test pilot training school. This is where we did all the highly classified tests of aircraft. And to m y knowledge we had nothing any where near that speed or any thing that was circular. 92"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Now this craft went 15 m iles in that short period of tim e (one second or so). Now you could calculate how fast it cam e toward us. And then just like put the brakes on in front of us. You take som ething 300 feet in diam eter, and y ou don’ t see m uch out of y our cockpit window. I’ve been corresponding with a m agnetic engineer for several y ears that’s writing a book. He’s already gotten pretty close to 100 pilot reports (of UFOs with m agnetic effects on the aircraft). And I gave him , in de tail, every thing that happened. When I went to set the autom atic pilot back , the m agnetic com pass, which was in the center of the panel, was swinging back and forth. I said to Fred, I said, did y ou see that? He said, y ou should have seen it when the craft was close. He said it was spinning. And so then we looked at the other com passes. At that tim e the craft was sitting out m aybe five m iles from us. We had what we called Bird Dogs. They are low fre quency radio com ponents that will point to the station when y ou tune in the station. These two Bird Dogs were pointing toward the craft. We had two other com passes. We had a rem ote com pass, which is out in the wing; it was reacting. There were a total of five different directional gy ros in that airplane. And out of the five, three of them were acting up. I was told that it was tracked by radar. He said, as far as he knew the radar report was sent in to the Air Force Headquarters in Washington, D.C. It usually goes from there to Wright Patterson AFB. But m y boss found the report in the Archives in Wright Patterson in Project Blue Book after talking to Colonel Watson, and he c onfirm ed the speed of 1,800 m iles. I said where did y ou find that out? He said, well, it was a ra dar report and it said that. So som ething happened to the radar report before they m icrofilm ed it. Because what I have on m icrofilm I got from the Archives (and the radar report is m issing). I was told by a friend of m ine at Wright Patterson AFB that I’ve known for y ears that they had allo wed Steven Spielberg m icrofilm this, the Blue Book records or whatever for Close Encounters of th e Third Kind. So he (Spielberg) had a pretty high clearance. He had to be associated with som e of the ... well, y ou know who, as far as the control group is concerned. The other plane com mander I located m any years ago but he was with this com pany and he wouldn’t talk. After he retired, I got a hold of hi m again in 1996 and I flew out to where he lived and I said, what we will do is we’ll just take a ta pe recorder and we’ll just discuss it. So that’s what happened. In the report that I wrote, his statem ent is in there, several pages of his statem ent. His schem atic of what he saw is in there. And it was am azing how they m atched. [We have this full report with the oth er pilot’s corroboration of events. SG] The docum ent that I found [ See Governm ent Docu ments] was the official docum ent that the Air Force had put together. And it was originally filed under Project Grudge. [Refer to the testimony of AF Colonel Charl es Brown who was part of Project Grudge.

And he showed m e pictures. The first pictures that I had ever seen. There was nothing, absolutely nothing there that looked close to it. There was one that was 100 feet in diam eter. It didn’t look like it was dam aged too mu ch. [He implies here that these were photos of retri eved or crashed objects since he can comment on the extent of damage. SG] So he’ s the one that I asked a lot of questions. I said what happens to this report. And he told m e exactly what happens. He say s there is a com mittee. Now these are his words: “There is a joint intelligence com mittee...” And he said, “... and they m ake the decisions as to where it goes.” They were com ing to m e a lot of tim es and s howing m e photographs. A lot of them looked like what we would call foo fighters. A lot of them looked like just a round, bright disc of som e kind. There was a Secretary of the Navy Kim ball ... I was what y ou would call a VIP Plane Com mander in the Flag Division, which flew m ost of the high-ranking officers and civilians out of Washington, D.C. Several of these officials to ld m e what they had seen. For exam ple, there were two craft fly ing together out in the Pacific. And a bright disc cam e up beside one of them and stay ed with them for a while and flew around it. Our office cam e under the headquarters of Wright Patterson. It was a central district. You had pilot m eetings. You had all these types of meetings. And I would go down there about once or twice a m onth to the m eetings, plus I would go m aybe two or three tim es a y ear for sem inars ... it would be a week or so. Once, while on the flight line where we park ed our plane we weren’t too far from what looked like a hanger. It looked like a corrugated m etal hanger. And it was open most of the tim e. Every tim e m y boss and I would go by there he couldn’t understand why I was not interested in going and looking at what was behind the m etal wall back there. And he told me basically that they had a craft (UFO) back there. And he told me basically that they did have ET bodies there. Now he’s not the first one that ever told m e that. From discussions that he had had with Adm iral Forney he learned that Adm iral Forney (who was our m issile chief and had spent tim e at Wh ite Sands) was convinced that craft from other planets were visiting us. He kept bringing up Colonel Watson also. He said Colonel Watson let him look at a lot of these files, plus he was the one that told him about what they had there. He saw what they had there [ the ET craft and bodies] , and as I said he couldn’t understand why I wasn’ t interested. I said, well, really I don’ t have any interest because I will never be able to talk about it. And I know enough now from what I’ ve seen that I know they exist. It was a craft at Wright Patterson AFB. It was a craft that did crash som ewhere. SG: Extraterrestrial? 94"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":" GB: Extraterrestrial craft, exactly . Yes. And the bodies that he was talking about were extraterrestrial. Well, I’m convinced of what I saw. To m y know ledge we wouldn’t have had any thing of that size. And I’m certain that it was from another planet, not from this planet. Our technology was not such at that tim e that we could have any kind of a craft like that, I’ m sure of that. I had a top-secret clearance. But here we get back to the need to know. And I am sure that in a lot of cases the other people had the need to know about certain things that I didn’ t have. And so I’ m sure that if we had any thing from another planet, that som e of these engineers would be involved, whether they were m agnetic engineers or aeronautical engineers or whatever they were, they would be involved. Regarding Corso’s book, I was involved in som e th ings that I’m suspicious were of the sam e nature. They were asking us to see if we could find a contractor in the area that could build som ething like this, to back-engineer som ething lik e this. And we never thought about it when he said, well, it wasn’t our technology . Later in the ‘60s, we were just m oving into a new hom e. My son was about eight y ears old. And we were sodding the backy ard. And I went into the house to wash up and he cam e into the house and say s, dad, m ommy wants y ou outside. I said, what for? He said, we’re looking at fly ing saucers. Well, I thought to m yself what th e heck does he know about fly ing saucers? So I go outside and here she is standing and pointing to som ething up above us. And y ou know what it was? It was a ship and there were sm aller craft all around it. So I go back in the house to get the binoculars because I wanted to get a good look at this. So I com e back and the ship itself had gone but I got a chance to see two or three of the sm all ones. So when we got back in the house I said to m y wife, how did y ou find out about fly ing saucers? Because we were not supposed to tell even our wives of our encounter, which was in 1951. 95"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"96"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"97"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"98"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"99"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":" 100"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":" 101"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":" 102"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":" 103"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":" 104"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":" Testimony of Mr. Enrique Kolbeck, Senior Air Traffic Controller October 2000 Mr. Enrique Kolbeck is a senior Air Traffic Controller at Mexico City International Airport. In his testim ony he speaks about the frequent UFO sightings seen at the airport visually and on radar. They are clocked at trem endous speeds and m aking alm ost instantaneous hairpin turns. Of the 140 air traffic controllers at the airport, he estim ates that over 50 have seen this phenom enon. Du ring one sighting, 32 controllers visually saw the sam e red and white lights sim ultaneously moving around a conventional landing aircraft. There have been reports from all f our air traffic control centers in Mexico of these UFOs . My nam e is Enrique Kolbeck. I am an Air Traffic Controller at Mexico International Airport. I have been a controller for 25 y ears. From the Mexico Control Center, we have ha d m any sightings of UFO phenom enon. They appear suddenly and frequently cross the flight paths of the incom ing aircraft. We see them on the radar screen and som etim es the pilots give us inform ation about what they are seeing. We don’t have any kind of control over this kind of phenom enon, of course. And the pilots definitely feel insecure about the control of the airspace around their aircraft. Fly ing saucers: In the past, to hear that would be very funny . Today , it is very serious for us. Especially after the incident we had with Aerom exico flight 109. Four y ears ago m ore or less, we had an incident that was very dangerous invol ving an unidentified object. The UFO was fly ing over a very im portant building in the city . It is located on the final track of runway five for Mexico City Airport. This flight was com ing from Guadalajara to Me xico City and I passed the control of this aircraft to the other controller. It is beginning the approach for runway five precisely . We saw two objects on the screen, two craft, very close to the aircraft at that moment. But it very suddenly and quickly disappeared. We had radar contact for more or less, thirty seconds. And the pilot doesn’t report any thing. Then later we di scovered that this aircraft in the final turn hit his principle landing gear on this kind of object. It is im portant that y ou know that we recei ved inform ation two hours later from people who were watching the phenom enon fly over the buildi ng. Then we heard som ething about the airplane hitting this object and it was very , very dangerous for us- because we have responsibility to know about every thing that is fly ing in our airspace. We have a lot of reports about UFOs fly ing very close to the final track, within four or five miles from the final approach. It is very real and on radar; we have inform ation about those encounters, precisely . In the week of the Ae rom exico encounter, we had about seven reports from pilots at different in tim es. It is im portant that you know that these UFOs appear on our radar screens and show up like a point digitally . They m oved definitively very fast. The hum an aircrafts- Boeing 727, Boeing 757- m ove in a different way and of course their speed is com pletely different from the UFOs. When you have the view of the airspace and the radar screen y ou see the UFOs go around twenty or thirty miles in a second. That is very real. And of course it is nothing like other hum an aircraft. The UFOs can turn suddenly and turn alm ost ninety degrees in a second or a half second. 105"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":" When this kind of phenom enon appears, we see it som etim es twelve tim es a day , or it may appear twelve tim es a m onth or a week -- y ou don’ t have inform ation about when these UFOs will appear. Also, the UFOs can go vertically straight up very quickly . That is com pletely different, of course, from even the m ilitary aircraft. But this phenom enon doesn’t com e with a fli ght plan. Nobody knows any thing about them . They appear when they want to appear. The pilots som etim e becom e scared and require im mediate inform ation. A lot of pilots report when they have a sighting and som etim es report problem s with their instrum ents of flight, the el ectronic instrum ents. These UFOs com e within 2- 5 m iles of their aircraft. I have been seeing these UFOs on radar for seven years. Many sightings were reported near the volcano outside Mexico City . Once, near the volcano, a Mexican pilot had an experience with three objects fly ing around him . Two of these objects were fly ing on top of the wings of the aircraft and the other flew in front of him . We had the radar register that inform ation. We have around 140 controllers at the Mexico Cent er. I think that 50 at least have seen the objects on the radar screen and had visual contact with the UFOs. On one occasion we had two Mexican aircraft fly ing from the north to land when one of them reported seeing a sm all object of red color passing beside him very fast. And the aircraft that was fly ing behind him also reported it. Within one m inute of that, we saw it from th e tower - a lot of people ran to the windows to watch this phenom enon. One was red and the other two were white. Around 32 air traffic controllers had the sam e sighting of this UFO! In Mexico, we have four Control Centers and 52 airports. In the four Control Centers, we have been getting inform ation about radar tracking th is kind of phenom enon. Yes, in all four. In Matzatlan, we have inform ation that around fift een y ears ago two com mercial flights and another private aircraft were fly ing in Mazetlan airspace very close to the border of the United States. There were about four or five UFOs fly ing around there. The hum an pilots were so scared that they decided finally to land on Mazetlan. They didn’ t consider the airspace safe at that m oment. Our Mexican authorities have sent out a lot of inform ation about p ilots’ and controllers’ reports of UFOs in our country . I am sure that y our country [the US] has inform ation about these UFOs. I am sure that in y our country a lot of controllers have inform ation about pilots’ reports and sightings of pilots. I am sure. We also have a case where this lady took a picture with her cam era of a UFO at the sam e tim e that we have a detection on the radar screen 40 m iles away . We received inform ation from different sources about that sighting which happened near Metepec. After that event, we had a very busy week with sightings- they happened each day for a week. Som e pilots have seen these objects or fly ing saucers going down inside of the volcano. Just like other radars in the world, our radar doesn’t detect light. It only detects solid objects fly ing. That is very im portant. When y ou ha ve inform ation from pilots, controllers and people walking in the street seeing at the sam e tim e the sam e object, definitely you are talking about som ething real. It is very real. Really , the im portant thing for m e and for the professional guy s like m e is that they represent traffic. At one tim e, we had registered on radar inform ation about twelve or fifteen UFOs at the sam e tim e! At the sam e tim e! They were very close to the city and the airport also. 106"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":" The pilots report the size of som e of these objects at around 100 m eters or greater. I rem ember reports of a Mexicana aircraft fly ing fro m Santa Cruz to Mexico City and they had a sighting of a very large UFO. Another pilot fly ing 40 m iles behind the first aircraft has the sam e object in sight. They are talking about how enorm ous it was. With 40 m iles between the aircraft, the object was enorm ous. Testim ony of Dr. Richard Haines Novem ber 2000 Dr. Haines has been a NASA resear ch scientist since the mid 1960’ s. He has worked on the Gem ini, Apollo, and Sky lab program s as well as sever al others. Over the past 30 y ears, Dr. Haines has com piled over 3,000 cases of unusual visual and radar sightings of unexplained aerial phenom ena. He notes that num erous foreign cases also appear in the literature and are very sim ilar in nature to the Am erican reports . In one case here in Am erica, a B-52 captain told him that he and his crew had five round spheres appear just off of each wingtip, behind their aircraft, above the aircraft, and below and they kept up with the plane at cruise altitude and speed. The captain tried to shake the s pheres with evasive m aneuvers but each sphere kept exact position. There are other cases where pilots look into the transparent cupola of som e of the UFOs and detail can be seen inside. ... In many cases, Air Force interceptors have been sent up to identify or investigate the phenom enon. And the pilot m ight ask for radar c overage. Did y ou see any thing on radar? I have many , m any cases in m y AIRCAT files where there is good, positive, visual radar correspondence. AIRCAT stands for Air Catalogue. This is a rath er extensive library I’ve been collecting for alm ost 30 y ears now from com mercial, m ilitary , private and test pilots. I have over 3,000 cases. I have tape recordings or video recordings of the interviews with som e of the pilots. I have FAA tapes that y ou can obtain as a citizen through Freedom of Inform ation Act requests. And so this database is very large. Those cases that are not com plete are usually the result of a hesitancy on the part of the pilot to disclose every thing. If th ey are a com mercial pilot, for instance, there m ay be concerns about job security or ridicule... We have an interesting case involving several aircraft, com passes deviating, radio frequency interference, and radar. There is a wealth of data there. And it just am azes m e that m y colleagues in the phy sical sciences, for som e reason aren’ t interested in this subject... Is there som e intelligent guidance behind the phe nom enon? Well that’s a scientific question. That is a valuable scientific question. And to me, where I am right now in the data analy sis, I think there is. I’m gaining m ore and m ore data to m ake this case that there is a high degree of intelligence and control behind this phenom enon... I had a B-52 captain tell m e once that he was fly ing in the front left seat of a brand new B-52 from Wichita, Kansas, where it was m ade by the Bo eing Corporation. His job was to ferry that aircraft with a light crew to an Air Force base in the southwestern part of Am erica. It was a clear, sunny day , beautiful bright sky , and an object, a round sphere, probably four or five feet in diam eter with no m arkings, no rivets, no seam s, no insignias, no USAF on the side- showed up right off his left wing tip. Well, his co-pilot said, Captain, we have an object off our right wing tip and he described it and it was the sam e shape, si ze, every thing, identical to this one on the left wing. So there are two objects now keeping up with the aircraft at cruise altitude and cruise speed. 107"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":" Well, to m ake a long story short, he told m e that an object showed up behind the aircraft, above the aircraft, below the aircraft and off each wi ng tip, five total. And, I said, well, what did you do. He said, well, I hit the autopilot butt on on the control colum n and went into evasive maneuvers, which is kind of standa rd operating procedure, to try to shake these things. He said if they were balloons, they weren’t going to keep up with us very long. If they were birds, why were they at that altitude and fly ing at 300 or 400 m iles an hour, so forth and so on. Good, typical piloting behavior, checking off what they weren’ t, y ou see. Well, he said, no m atter what he did with that aircraft, they stay ed with the aircraft, perfectly aligned. It is called station keeping. So he said, after a while of this, we are running out of fuel and I ha ve a job to do. So he added power, got back up to cruise altitude, and put her back on autopilot. After 15 or so minutes more the objects departed from the aircraft in the exact opposite order they arrived. Intelligence. To m e that’s not random . That is intelligence. That is deliberate... Now the skeptics will say that these are all visu al illusions. And I can’ t buy that. Not all these cases, not with three sets of ey eballs in that cockpit, not with radar confirm ation, not with ground confirm ation by radar and ev en additional aircraft nearby ... Pilots, being professionals, have careers at stake. And so it is easier not to report them and usually they don’t report them . My estim ate is that for every one pilot who does com e forward and m akes a confidential or a public report, there are 20, 30 other pilots who don’t. As a result of this review of m y AIRCAT files, I found a num ber of cases back in the ‘60’ s for instance when the Air Force w as still heavily involved in this subject, where they stepped in and interrogated com mercial pilots. Not just their own m ilitary pilots, but also com mercial pilots. The Air Force ended the interview by say ing y ou are not to tell any body about what y ou saw... Quite often there is a little protrusion either on the top or the bottom , or both, that som e people describe as a cupola or a cockpit of som e sort . And very often, they are transparent. And detail can be seen inside the windows. It is very interesting for a pilot to look y ou in the ey e and tell you that he saw this at 100 yards distance, at altitude. That has a great em otional im pact on me, I m ust say ... Testim ony of Mr. Franklin Carter, US Navy Decem ber 2000 Mr. Carter was trained as an electronic radar technician in the Navy in the 50’ s and 60’ s. He tells of an incident where he witnessed a clear, unam biguous radar contact speeding along at 3,400 m iles an hour. There were othe r radar operators as well who, at various tim es in 1957 and 1958, also witnessed these unusually fast m oving objects. At the tim e, the fastest hum an aircraft clocked in at 1,100 m iles and hour. In one case an Air Force operator tracked one of these UFOs 300 to 400 miles out in space. When these reports repeatedly kept com ing in to General Electric who m anufactured the radar, their technicians cam e in and m odified the electronics so that the radar would lim it it’s reporting to 12 to 15 m iles out into space. ...But we had a very unusual experience one night. I was a radar specialist and m y job was to m aintain the radar’s aboard the ship... I got off-duty one night at midnight and went to bed and was called and told to com e fix the radar, there was som ething wrong with it. When I got up to CIC and I asked them what the pr oblem was. They said, well, we are tracking an aircraft here at 3,400 m iles an hour. And I said, well, there is som ething wrong. So I took that 108"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":" radar offline, put the stand-by radar online and went to work. And I started running all the tests. And every thing was norm al. And I com pleted all of the prelim inary tests that y ou would run to check out a radar and every thing checked out absolutely norm al... They told m e this had been an absolute stellar contact -- this was a blip that was better than a half-inch across which indicated a really large targ et or som ething very close. It tracked every sweep. And if y ou get anom alies usually what will happen is every sweep or every other sweep you’ll get a blank or m aybe every 10 sweeps but it’ll blank out. But this one was solid on every sweep and that indicates a solid target... Then one night I was on the plot board, m aybe th ree or four months later. And here com es this contact. And with the second blip y ou could see that this thing was really m oving. It was moving like three or four inches on a 360-m ile scale. And so sure enough, I plotted it and it was 3,400 miles an hour. And again we didn’t report it. But they say there is nothing wrong, this is our friend back. We didn’t m ake a big deal out of it but we sure would have liked to know what that was: 3,400 miles an hour in 1957! The closest thing that we had was about 1,100 m iles an hour then. It continued to happen during the y ear, the last part of ‘57, and up until May of ‘58. It happened at least three m ore tim es. And I had ra dar operator friends that would tell m e, well, we had another one of those fast ones last night. And it alway s was at night... We tracked them at 3,400 m iles an hour. He said, the interesting part of it was we tracked them 300 and 400 m iles out in space. And he said, we com plained to General Electric who had built the sy stem . And so we kept reporting these events and they kept telling us we couldn’ t report that stuff. So we said, well, we are doing it and it is real. And so they cam e in and actually made m ovies of the scope and when they took th em back and analy zed what they were seeing, they cam e back and put a fix into the radar so their distance into space was like 12 or 15 m iles. They said, that’ s all the ballistic m issiles will ever go. You don’ t need to see any further. So they just lim ited the receivers to where the scope would only expand to where they could see 12 to 15 miles out in space. His nam e was Dave Wallace... When people claim that these UFOs m ay be the figm ent of m y im agination, I say I was a dam n good E.T. [ electronics technician] . I knew m y radar. It was m y love at the tim e. And I know the system s and that there was nothing wrong with those sy stem s. I knew that we were tracking real contacts. I knew the difference betw een what they call running rabbits and all of the other test bogey s that they would give us. I doubt very seriously that in 1956 and ‘57, that the U.S. had craft, even in the experim ental stage, that could fly 3,400 m iles an hour, repeatedly ...They didn’t want any body to know any thing about what we were seeing. And I think that started the cover-up. And then it got out of hand. But I know that the only people that they are k eeping it secret from today are the Am ericans. Every body else knows about it and accepts it. And all of the other Governm ents in the world except England and the U.S. prim arily , are accepting it. It’ s very irritating to m e personally , to see that go on... I think it is im portant that we recognize that there are civilizations that we need to com municate with. And I think we’ ve reached that point in our evolution as a hum an race that we need to recognize that. And the thing that disturbs m e is that the U.S. is going to be a third world nation in that field if we are not careful by having all of this secrecy and refusing to set up 109"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":" any kind of diplom atic protocols as I know that y ou [SG] have called for and which I believe in very strongly .

I’m hoping that people will com e to their senses and stop hiding this stuff from the U.S. citizens... I also investigated a military sighting by a friend of m ine. We knew each other in business for about seven or eight y ears. And he did not know that I had any interest in UFO’s. And I did not know that he knew what a UFO was until I saw him m ake a report of a sighting one day . So I called him up and talked to him about it. He told m e about his si ghting when he was a Lieutenant in the Air Force. He was a navigator on a RB-36, which had the big cam eras and they did all of the secret photographing back in the ‘50’ s. He was the navigator on one of these with 22 people aboard his plane. They were up over Nort h Dakota and som ebody called from the tail gunner section and said look out over the left wing. And out- they estim ated 100 y ards from the left wing- was this 100-foot disc. And this was as cl ear as day . He say s they talked to the radar control tower and they had it on radar. All of the guy s got up and went and took pictures of it. They had been given cam eras. Now this is anothe r part of it- the secrecy thing. They had been given 35m m cam eras and told how to fill out a report if they saw a UFO. He said all 22 guy s got up and looked out the window and saw this thing fo r about five or six m inutes and then it just took off... What was interesting was that when he landed they were m et by an Air Force group. They debriefed all of these people and told them that they could not discuss it for 12 y ears, and that they were under a secrecy oath. And then a week later a group from Washington cam e out and debriefed them and rem inded them of their secrecy oath. They confiscated all of the cam era and the film s and every thing. And then when he w as discharged from the Air Force he was a Colonel in the Reserves, they rem inded him again that he had signed a secrecy oath about this. His nam e is Jim Lloy d. Testimony of Mr. Neil Daniels, Airline Pilot Novem ber 2000 Mr. Daniels is a pilot with over 30,000 of flight tim e spanning 59 y ears. He entered the Air Force and becam e a B-17 pilot surviving 29 com bat m issions. After leaving the Air Force he worked for United Airlines for 35 year s. He tells about the tim e in March of 1977 when he was fly ing a com mercial flight from San Francisco to Boston. The plane was on autopilot when by itself it began to bank left. He looked out the window and noticed a brilliant bright light. The first and second officers both saw it also. They were perplexed because all three com passes reported different readings. ...The one and only sighting that I had was in March of 1977. I was fly ing a DC-10 on a flight from San Francisco to Boston. And it w as United Flight 94. We were about halfway between Buffalo and Albany at 37,000 feet, fog cover underneath, dark night, when all of a sudden the airplane which was on auto pilot starte d a 15 degree turn to the left. And of course I looked out the window and I saw this brilliant light. The first officer saw it and the second officer got out of his seat and took a look. And that’ s when the Air Traffic Control in Boston wanted to know what was happening. So we told them when we figured it out we’d give them a call. And about that tim e the first officer hit the auto pilot release button and went back to manual contro l. As I was looking out the window this thing that we had seen disappeared back towards the left of the airplane and to our rear at a very rapid rate. The whole event took place in probably less than three m inutes or so... 110"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":" Well, the first officer’ s autopilot, which is c onnected to the Captain’ s com pass, is out in the left wingtip of the airplane. And apparently for som e reason or another the magnetic force was interrupted to cause the aircraft to veer off course because it is hooked up to the com pass. All three com passes were giving different readings, which is very unusual. So what we gathered was it was an enorm ous m agnetic force in whatever th at ball was that we saw out there, that white light. After we turned the autopilot off and the firs t officer straightened out the airplane the magnetic interference that had m ade the com passes all different readings ended and all returned to norm al. And the object had disappeared away from us. So every thing returned to a norm al state... In the past pilots that had seen things and had talked about it were let go. Som e were released from their fly ing and treated as nutcases and things like that. So that was the last I said of it for many , m any years. Quite a few pilots have told m e of their incide nts and their sightings and what has happened. And one especially , was a sighting back on the east coast and he saw this thing for a long tim e, som ething like 18 m inutes. And when he reported it to his boss, it was a different airline not United Airlines, they investigated it and the Gove rnm ent said, well, that’s swam p gas. At 18,000 feet, doing 250 knots, swam p gas! No one really wanted to adm it that there m ight possibly be som ething there. Testimony of Sgt. Robert Blaz ina (retired) August 2000 Mr. Robert Blazina is a retired m ilitary m an with a top-secret clearance. He worked transporting nuclear weapons all over th e world. He personally witnessed a UFO maneuvering in the clear nights sky at an incredible speed straight up. Another tim e he and a civilian 747 both saw on their radar screens an object travel an estim ated 10,000 miles an hour directly at them . ... My first experience with UFOs was in 1952. I was on a flight from Seattle, com ing back to Sacram ento. It was between 10 and 12 m idnight. It was a clear, dark night. Sitting there, looking ahead, I saw this orange glow in front of us.... We added power and we kept getting closer a nd of course it got larger until we got up to about Redding, California. It went into a descent and we followed it. We picked up quite a bit of speed in a shallow dive and it went clear into Sacram ento and across the city and right over the capital building. We were right on it. We had the aircraft redlined, as fast as it could go. At that point, it went vertical and it disappeared in a m atter of two seconds, straight up... While in the Air Force Reserves in the 1970s, we were com ing back from Germ any . We were in a C-141 and we were, at the tim e, 35, 000 feet plus. We were around two hours out of Dover, Delaware. Again, it was clear skies, but dark. We observed this object on our radar screen. We had two of the scopes on board, the p ilots had one and the na vigator had one, and it was on both of them . It would com e directly at us, but we couldn’ t see it visually and then it would turn off.

Testim ony of Lieutenant Frederick Marshall Fox, US Navy (retired) Septem ber 2000 Lieutenant Fox was in the Navy in the 60’ s fly ing attack planes. He had a top-secret clearance and served in Vietnam . He is a retired pilot of 33 y ears with Am erican Airlines. In his testim ony , he reveals that there is a publication called JANAP 146 E that has a section which states that no one is to share any inform ation regarding the UFO phenom enon under penalty of $10,000 fine and 10 y ears in prison. During one incident in late 1964, while fly ing an A4 Sky hawk, he say s that all of a sudden a darkened saucer shaped object about 30 feet in diam eter appeared on his left side. There were many other events over the course of his career where he observed saucer shaped and cigar shaped UFOs over m ilitary installations as well as one tim e seeing two red lights traversing the night’s sky from horizon to horizon in three seconds. He was afraid to bring up these events to others due to the inherent ridicule in the subject. ...In the Navy m y rank was Lieutenant and I was a nuclear weapons delivery pilot so I had a top-secret clearance. Well, as far as the Navy goes I was Code 4 PU BS, which was a confidential publications and com munications officer. There is a publication called JANAP 146 E that had a section that say s you will not reveal any inform ation regard ing the UFO phenom enon under penalty of $10,000.00 fine and ten y ears in jail. So they were qu ite adam ant that whatever experiences y ou had y ou were not to go public with it without their perm ission... I was out about 180 m iles from the carrier one night by m yself at about 20,000 feet when an object showed up on m y left side. It didn’t have any hostile intent; it was just there observing m e. And I sort of observed it and cam e away with a very peaceful feeling. I never said any thing to any body until later in m y career with the airlines. I later found out a fellow shipm ate of m ine had a sim ilar incident. The object was m aybe 30 feet in diam eter... Ma ybe it was an intelligence gathering disc. It was saucer shaped... The subject never cam e up with Air Traffic Contro l. In any event I would never have opened my m outh. There was a Captain, Pete Killian, who was written about in som e of the UFO books. He was a Captain with Am erican Airlines back in the ‘50’ s that evidently had a sighting and testified before the Senate com mittees. And then there was another captain that actually took a photograph of a UFO off his wings. And of course they were subject to ridicule. I didn’t want to go that direction. So, I never reported any thing to FAA or the m ilitary . A lot of pilots just did not want to get involved in this because of peer pressure and ridicule. So the secret has been kept... I have a very personal friend that was a B-24 pilot during W.W.II that got into [the] O.S.S. And he was one of the first people into Japan after the atom ic bom b was dropped on Hiroshim a, Nagasaki. He ended up on Project Bluebook, S ection 13, which I believe was the top-secret 112"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":" portion of that investigation. At the tim e he was a captain in the Air Force. He’s in his late ‘70’s now and he is still being carried on active duty as a captain. I don’t know if he’s being paid but if he’s on active duty he should be a three star gene ral with tim e and rank a nd he should be paid. And the whole reason that they have kept him on active duty is to keep his national security oath active because of what he knows. There are certain things that he will not talk to me about because of that security oath even though I had a top secret clearance with the Navy and we are both very interested in the sam e thing. For whatever reason the Governm ent, or tho se agencies of Governm ent, deem necessary to protect their agendas, which obviously now, aren’t our agendas. I think it is tim e for us to act, to end this charade. And to take whatever steps are necessary to insure that the hum an race evolves properly and enjoy s the fruits of that evolution. Testim ony of Captain Massim o Poggi Septem ber 2000 Captain Poggi is a senior 747 captain for Alitalia . He relates an event where when fly ing from Rom e to Sao Paolo in July of 1999 he witnessed a glowing green halo soaring past just 500 feet below his 747. The aircraft experi enced a sudden jum p when this UFO passed underneath. Very noisy static cam e through his headphones during this experience. At another tim e while fly ing over Turin Italy in 1992, he saw a distant elliptical sphere maintaining a very steady position relative to the clouds as if stationary . He saw this UFO through a spotting scope. After looking away to br iefly speak to his co-pilot, he looked back and it was gone. My nam e is Massim o Poggi. I am a senior captain, of a Boeing 747 in Alitalia, Italy ’s airline. On the 1 st of July , 1999, I was fly ing from Rom e to Sao Paolo, Brazil. Alm ost at the m id-Atlantic position we had a background noise on our hea dphones which was increasing and becam e very , very noisy with static. Then in a couple of seconds we saw a halo, a glowing green, glowing light, diffuse, just fly ing very fast below our nose, below our aircraft. At the sam e tim e the 747 had a sudden jum p, just one, only one jum p. Half a second later the noise and light had disappeared. That’s the only jum p we had in eleven hours [ of] flight. This object was very , very near. We were fly ing at 930 kilom eters per hour, about 500 knots, and the object that crossed under us was a lot faster - I think 1,000 knots, or much more. The object was below us but not by m uch - m aybe 500 feet. It was very near, y es. For an aircraft fly ing, it was a near collision. Testimony of Lieutenant Bob Walker, US Army October 2000 Lieutenant Walker was a 2 nd lieutenant in the Arm y. After World War II at a NASA (then NACA) open house he saw a 30-foot sau cer-shaped craft which had been brought back from Germ any for study . On another o ccasion he was piloting an aircraft for a TV station when a disc shaped object cam e in fro m the west. He had his cam era and clim bed to 12,000 feet to take som e photos of it. After landing, he im mediately had the pictures developed and enlarged. The object turned out to be a football shaped silver object with points at each end. His film was s ubsequently taken from him under unusual circum stances. In his testim ony he also sp eaks of a tim e when he happened into a diner late at night near Ft. Cam pbell in Kentuc ky and overheard conversations from MPs about 113"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":" how a fly ing saucer had landed next to a n earby farm house and the MP’ s were there cordoning off the area. Creatures were present and were shot at by the frightened farm house owner. ...I happened to catch a strange transm ission from the tower. The tower said that there was a disc shaped object com ing in from the west. And I thought, “Well this is a pretty good opportunity . I will take a look and see if I can see it.” I guess now if I were to estim ate altitude the object would be som ewhere not less than 50,000 and on up. So I called the tower after they were m aking people alert of what was com ing over the area. And the tower said, “What do y ou want to do?” And I said, “If y ou don’ t m ind, will y ou release me from 2,000 and let m e go to 12,000, which was m y m axim um altitude without oxy gen. And they said, “Go right ahead.” And it took m e several m inutes to clim b from two to twelve and I got up and about that tim e a silver ball was passing over and I took a num ber of shots on 35m m film as it was going over. And the next thing that I knew it was gone. Af ter I had gotten down, I asked what happened and they said, “Well, they had alerted the fighters at Langley to take a look at what it was. And by the tim e they could get scram bled and get in the air and get to that altitude, it was gone... I didn’t make it known to any body but som ehow som ebody knew that I had this picture and I got a call, probably about six or eight weeks later. And they said, “We are into this area of gathering inform ation on possible UFOs and I unde rstand that y ou took som e pictures and would you m ind loaning them to us so that we could ju st take a look.” I didn’t ask for credentials or any thing like that and I said, “Well, in addition to pictures I also have kind of an interesting collection of news item s that have com e over AP for the past five y ears.” And, they said, “Well, bring those along. We are interested. We would like to look at that.” The house was not furnished as though it was a hom e. It was very lightly furnished. It was an older hom e and didn’t have any thing in it of any value, as I recall. No antiques and no oriental rugs or any thing. In fact, it was kind of shabby . It kind of m ade m e curious as to what he did and who else was in the house. But I turned it over to him and I thought, “Well, call me when you are finished or else I will com e back and get it.” And he didn’t call m e for about two or three weeks. And I thought, “Well, that is enough tim e.” Since I didn’t hear from him and I didn’t have his telephone num ber, I thought I would go on back to the house and pick it up. Well, I got to the house and the house was em pty . I had no idea who the person was. I was very naïve- more so because I didn’ t keep a negative on it and I didn’ t keep a print. These were original things that I had. The newspaper didn’ t keep a copy either because when we did that we were just doing it for our own interest. It wasn’ t for print or publication. And they disappeared from m y life forever... Another tim e, I was interviewing the Director of NASA at Langley and we began talking about fly ing saucers. I got the ty pical nebulous but not evasive answers. And one of the things we were talking about was different aircraft and UFOs and we were kind of blending the subject in together very nicely . So I said, “Well what about aircraft in the future? What are they going to be like? And he said, “We have aircraft now. We have vehicles or aircraft now that we could actually fly but they are so unique and so unorthodox that the public would not accept them . He was explaining that these craft were not conve ntional. I guess he was referring to the fact, no rudder, no tail, no wings or whatever... 114"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":" Testimony of Mr. Don Bockelman, US Army Septem ber 2000 Mr. Bockelm an was a Launch Area Electronics T echnician for the US Arm y.

Mr. Bockelm an heard num erous first hand accounts from various ra dar operators that they were seeing extrem ely fast targets m oving at 3500 m iles an hour. Som e of these were making im possibly sm all-radius turns. At one tim e he witnessed an attem pted to shoot one down with an air defense m issile near Mount Vernon, WA. ... There are technicians and operators dealing with really high speed, very m obile targets which were UFOs on radar. I heard a num ber of those accounts from operators. They were stationed at different places around the world. Inte grated Fire Control is where the radars were stationed in relation to the m issiles and it is a w hole bunch of radars. They would recount stories where vehicles would com e in and they would track them and pass them off and they would be going 700 m iles an hour and accelerate to 3,500 m iles in the atm osphere quite rapidly . It was off the scale in term s of what the technology for our potential Russian targets were. It was off the scale. I want to say that these operators are ve ry adept. They are trained to determ ine the difference between radar strikes and any atm ospheri c disturbances that can approxim ate targets. They are experts at it. So when they were tracking targets, they were tracking the actual phy sical objects in the atm osphere. They were 100% convinced that th ere were phy sical targets that were in the atm osphere and were involved in a variety of differe nt ty pes of travel. That was in the late 1960s that I was hearing these reports. The reports went back into the 1950s because a lot of the older operators had been on Ajax sites and they were tracking them ... After leaving the m ilitary , one evening I was sitting in m y living room and it was in October of 1978 and I had all the lights off and I was just sitting there letting m y m ind wander and quite abruptly all of a sudden four am ber lights starte d shining in the room and filling it with a diffuse am ber light. Needless to say , I turned around quite rapidly to determ ine what it was that I was seeing. And there were three lights who were approxim ately equal distance from each other and a fourth one off of the equal distance spacing a little bit, but in the sam e plane...

As it turned out it was a high explosive m issile right at the target. Sh rapnel was falling to the ground. It had exploded and the object was accelerating away at a m ind-boggling speed away from where the attack occurred. The actual attack on the craft occurred about ten m iles east of Sedro Woolley . I would say about three m iles north of the area called Ly man [ and] Ham ilton. About the objects which we tracked on radar while I was in the m ilitary , outside of the speed, the thing that was m ost im pressive about these targ ets is their capacity to have abrupt turns. People who are in air defense look at m ass and tu rning radius. We had nothing that was capable of m atching their capacity for m inuscule turning radiuses. We are talking about virtually no radius turns at high speeds. 2,000 m iles an hour and right angle turns. And not only turns but descents and ascents. They would descend rapidly .

I wish to em phasize again that the witnesses we ha ve here are diverse. They range from the Atom ic Energy Com mission to people who have been at Strategic Air Com mand facilities and at missile launch control facilities throughout the United States and Canada. These witnesses give unm istakably clear testim ony about the fact that th ese extraterrestrial vehicles appear to be quite concerned with our weapons of m ass destruction. And in fact, m ore than one of these witnesses have stated to m e that they believe that these extraterrestrial vehicles were there because they were very concerned that we m ight blow ourselv es up- or that we m ight begin to go into space and be a threat som eday to other civilizations. I believe this is very im portant because, while none of these witnesses has stated that there ever was any hostile action taken by these objects, it is qu ite clear that they are concerned about what we m ay do with weapons of m ass destruction. And this speaks to som ething very profound: That we have reached the point where the only possible future is one that is peaceful. The weapons are too powerful and the stakes are too high to advan ce any further and contem plate the use of such weapons. We m ust advance forward into space without using these vast weapons within our arsenal against any life form . The extraterrestrial civilizations, which appear to be m onitoring our activity and have been doing so for decades, m ay ind eed have this as one of their chief concerns. And it is very likely that entry into inter-plane tary society has as its prim ary requirem ent the ability for a people to advance in to space peacefully . For we are not talking now of muskets and canons and swords but of therm onuclear weapons , pulsed laser weapons, and exotic technologies which can rip the fabric of tim e-space. It m ust be clear to all that the only survivable future is a peaceful one. This peace is the hallm ark of the m aturation of the hum an race. It is also possible that people within the national m ilitary com mand structure, as well as the national security apparatus of the United States and other countries, have m isinterpreted som e of the actions from these extraterrestrial vehicles as a violation of our airspace or our sovereignty . I think we m ust take a wider look at this and consid er the fact that if we were to com e across a planet which, within a hundred y ears, had gone from an agrarian civilization to one capable of the early stages of space flight and which had thousands of therm onuclear devices capable of destroy ing worlds, that perhaps we would be concer ned as well. I think that we have to begin to look in the m irror as a people and ask ourselves what we should be doing to ensure a peaceful future for our planet and also to guarantee that we keep these weapons out of space forever. In discussing this issue about the Strategic Air Com mand facilities and nuclear events, y ou will learn that on som e occasions these objects, whic h have hovered over cont rol launch facilities or missile silos, have been able to take these devices o ff-line: That is, they have been able to render inert intercontinental ballistic m issiles. I do not be lieve that this is a sign of any hostility on their part but their way of say ing, \"Please don’ t destroy this beautiful planet; and know this: we will not let y ou destroy ours.\" I think it’s very im por tant for people to understand that such actions however, m ay have been m isinterpreted by certa in authorities within the vacuum of secrecy and this is som ething we m ust look at very carefu lly as a civilization. What happens within the darkness of secrecy ? Secrecy grows on itself, and it creates an inform ation and perspective vacuum where there’s not enough give and take w ith people of differing views or from different 123"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":" walks of life. In that m ilieu, it’ s very easy for paranoia and m isinterpretation to set in and that is one of the great inherent risks of obsessive secrecy -- the kind of secrecy which President Eisenhower warned us about in January of 1961. Testim ony of Captain Robert Salas Decem ber 2000 Captain Salas graduated from the Air Force Academ y and spent seven y ears in active duty from 1964 to 1971. He also held positions at Martin Marietta and Rockwell and spent 21 y ears at the FAA. In the Air For ce, he was an air traffic controller and a missile launch officer as well as an engineer on the Titan 3 m issiles. He testifies about a UFO incident on the m orning of March 16, 1967 where 16 nuclear missiles sim ultaneously becam e non-operational at tw o different launch facilities im mediately after guards saw UFOs hovering above. The guards could not identify these objects even though they were only about 30 feet away . The Air Force did an extensive investigation of the incidents and could not find a probable cause. At a debriefing about the incident, an officer from the Air Force O ffice of Special Investigations required him to sign a non-disclosure form and told him that he was not to talk about the event to any one including his fam ily or other m ilitary staff. At a tim e during the Cold War when minor technical anom alies were openly com municated am ongst the staff, this incident was not and to this day Captain Salas thinks this to be very unusual. RS: Capt. Robert Salas  SG: Dr. Steven Greer RS: My nam e is Robert L. Salas and I graduated from the Air Force Academ y and spent about seven and a half y ears in the Air Force on active duty from 1964 to 1971. Then I went to work for Martin Marietta first in Denver and th en Rockwell International here in the southern California area. I worked for the FAA in 1974 and worked for them for about 21 years and retired in 1995 from federal service. In the Air Fo rce I was an air traffic controller - we called it ground control intercept controller. And then I w as a missile launch officer. After that I was an engineer on the Titan 3 propulsion sy stem out of Los Angeles Air Force station. The UFO incident, happened on the m orning of March 16, 1967. I was on duty along with my com mander Fred My wald. We were both on duty at Oscar Flight as part of the 490 th strategic missile squad and there are five launch control f acilities assigned to that particular squadron. We were at Oscar Flight. It was still dark out and we’re sixty feet underg round [ at the ICBM launch control facility ]. It was early in the m orning and I received a call from my topside security guard who’ s the flight security controller and he said that he and som e of the guards had been observing som e strange lights fly ing around the site around the launch contro l facility . He said they were acting very unusual just fly ing around, and I said, “You mean UF O? He said, well, he didn’t know what they were but they were lights and were fly ing around. They were not airplanes; they weren’t m aking any noise. They were not helicopters; they we re making som e very strange m aneuvers and he couldn’t explain it. Well, I just kind of shook my head and said, “Call m e if any thing m ore im portant happens.” Basically we just ended the conversation. It wasn’t m ore than a few minutes- maybe a half hour later- and he calls back and this tim e he’s very frightened; I can tell by the tone of his voice he’s very shook up. He say s, “Sir, there’s a glowing red object hovering right outside the front 124"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":" gate -- I’m looking at it right now. I’ve got all the m en out here with their weapons drawn”. Of course he was very disturbed while he was telling m e this; he was very excited. I didn’t know what to m ake of it but he wanted m e to give him instructions or orders, tell him what to do. And I think I said som ething like, “M ake sure the perim eter fence is secure.” Then right away he said, “I’ ve got to go sir, one of these guards has been injured”, and he hung up. I im mediately went over to m y com mander who was taking a nap -- we have a little cot down there for rest periods -- and I was telling him about the telephone call we just received. As I was relating this to him our missiles started shutting down one by one. By shutting down, I m ean they went into a “no-go” condition m eaning they could not be launched. So we get bells and whistles- a red light no-go condition. As I recalled at the tim e, it seem ed like every one of them shut down but later in recalling this incident with m y com mander My wald, he said he felt we only lost maybe seven or eight of these weapons. SG: Can y ou describe what these weapons were, for the record? RS: These weapons were Minutem an One m issiles and were of course nuclear-tipped warhead m issiles. As they started shutting dow n, im mediately he gets up and we both start query ing the status board. We’ve got the ability to query and determ ine what the cause of the shutdowns were. As I recall, m ost of them were guidance and control sy stem failures. And then he started reporting to the com mand post. In the m eantim e I called upstairs to find out what the status was of this object and the guard said, well, the object has left - it just left at high speed. The injured guard was apparently try ing to clim b this barbed wire but it had nothing to do with the UFO firing any thing or injuring this airm an. I asked him what the object looked like and all he could say was that it was an oval shape glowing a reddish orange around the object. SG: How far away and what altitude was it? RS: Well, he said it was hovering right over the fence and that would have been within about 30 feet from him . The fence was m aybe eight feet high. There was also another incident that happened w ithin a week of this, just after, where there were radar reports and quite a few m ore witnesses. [See the corroborating testimony of Li eutenant Colonel Arne Arneson] The Air Force did an extensive investigation of the entire incident and was not able to com e up with a probable cause for the shutdowns. And I’ve got quite a few witnesses that will testify to that- we’ve got a couple of people who work ed on the investigative team - and I’ve got correspondence from the m an who actually organi zed the investigative team . There was no viable explanation for this [shutdown of multiple ICBMs] . Each m issile is basically self- supporting. Most of them are powered by com mercial power but each m issile has its own power generator. The only connection between the capsule and th e m issile sites them selves is what we call SIN-lines or sensitive inform ation network lines. They ’re basically buried cables but inside the capsule itself and these lines go to the m issiles dir ectly . The m issiles are not connected to each other so having a fault at one site would not affect m issiles at another location. 125"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":" At our site any where from six to eight we nt down but they went down in rapid succession which again is an extrem ely rare happening. We rarely had m ore than one m issile go down for any reason at all. And this was very rare. Weather was ruled out. Like I said an extensive investigation was done and power surges were rule d out. There was only one possibility that was looked at by one of the Boeing engineers that did som e test in the laboratory and he thought that som e kind of an electrom agnetic force or field m ight have caused the signal to go. But it would have had to go through the buried cable to each of these m issiles. After I talked to m y guard upstairs, m y co mmander talked to the com mand post. When he finished talking to the com mand post he turned to m e and said, “The sam e thing occurred at ECHO Flight.” ECHO Flight is another squadr on, I’d say probably 50 - 60 m iles away from our location but they had the sam e sort of thing happen. They had UFOs that were hovering, not at the launch control facility but at the actual launc h facilities where the m issiles are located. They had som e m aintenance and security people out ther e at the tim e and they observed the UFOs at those sites. Now they lost all ten of their weapons - all ten. SG: This is around the sam e tim e? RS: It was the sam e m orning. So that m orning we lost any where from between 16 to 18 ICBMs at the sam e tim e UFOs were in the area and were observed by airm en. Those m issiles were down the entire day because we’ ve got testim ony from Colonel Don Crawford, who relieved the crew at ECHO Flight and he was th ere when the m issiles were being brought up to alert status and he said it took the whole day . So I’ m assum ing it took our m issiles all day to be brought back up also. When we got relieved, I went ups tairs and the first thing I did was look in the guard’s ey e and say , “Hey , were y ou telling m e the truth about this object?” He swore up and down he was telling the truth. I believed him for a couple of reasons. I knew he was frightened when he called me down there and then when I looked him in the ey e and he told m e about the situation I certainly believed him . I wrote up a report about this incident; it was in m y log and I turned it in. When we got to the base we had to report to our squadron com mander right away . And in that room with m y squadron com mander was a fellow from AFOSI (we had an Air Force Office of Special Investigations on the base). He was there in th e office with the com mander. He asked for m y logs and he wanted a quick briefing although it seem ed to m e he knew pretty m uch what had happened already . But we gave him a quick briefing and then he asked us both to sign a non- disclosure agreem ent say ing this was classified in form ation- we were not to release this to any body , and that was it. We couldn’t talk; he to ld us we could not talk about this to any one, including any of the other crews, our spouses, our fam ily , even am ongst each other. That was the end of that. I was there at Malm strom [phonetic sp] for another two years after that and in that tim e we were never given a de-b riefing on any of the incidents- neither the ECHO incident or our own, which is very unusual b ecause we got briefed every m orning on any of the anom alies that were going on with the equipm ent. We got briefed and we discussed these technical issues that were going on with the w eapons but we never heard any thing else about these incidents. And these were m ajor ha ppenings. These were m ajor happenings. I’ve got a copy of a telex which we recei ved under FOIA com ing from SAC headquarters and com ing to Malstrom and other bases right after the m orning that happened say ing that this incident was of extrem e concern to SAC headquarters because they couldn’ t explain it. Nobody 126"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":" could explain what happened. A nd y et we never got de-briefed. And we were cleared for very high classification because these are nuclear weapons we’ re dealing with. We did get the security incursion alarm s at tho se sites when the m issile went down. That is unusual because usually when a missile went down for som ething like guidance failure, we wouldn’ t get security incursion alarm s, which means a perim eter is breached, an object crossed the fence, or som ething broke the security alar m sy stem that we had on the perim eter of the launch facility . I did sent out guards to a couple of those facilities to investigate that. The reason I think this story is very significant is because, going back to August of 1966 at Minot, ND, a very sim ilar thing happened at one of the launch control facilities at Minot Air Force Base. They had the sam e kind of weapon sy stem that we had- they had M-1 m issiles. This [UFO] was observed on radar, there was som e com munication failure and the object was observed over the launch control facility . That happened in August 1966 and that’s a well docum ented incident. About a week prior to my incident, in March 1967, I’ ve got a record of a call from one of the security guards who was out roam ing looking at the launch facilities and saw an object very sim ilar to what I just described over the launch facility . The com mander reported it to com mand post. About a week to ten day s after our incident, there’s a very well docum ented incident that happened at Malstrom . In this case, near Malstrom Air Force Base, a UFO was tracked by radar and was observed at relatively close range by a truck driver and highway patrol man. The Air Force did an investigation and there’ s an extensive report on the Air Force inv estigation of this UFO sighting because it flew around the base and very close to the base. So this is a whole series of things that ha ppened having to do with the sam e kind of weapon system , the Minutem an Missile. The reports that were m ade to m e by m y guard s were official reports. These were not jokes - they were not m eant to be any thing but official reports because we were dealing with strategic weapons during the Cold War, during the Vietna m War. They were professional, these guards, and they were not about to joke about weapons being down, about what they were seeing. So these were not rum ors, they were official reports . If they were recanted for any reason, these m en should have been court-m artiale d for giving false reports during a very sensitive incident. And none of that happened. Bob Kom inski headed up the organization to look at all aspects of these shutdowns. Kom inski relates to m e in writing that at som e point he was told by his boss that the Air Force said, “Stop the investigation; do no m ore on this and in addition do not write a final report.” Again, this is very unusual especially in light of the fact that CINC-SAC headquarters was stating that this was of extrem e im portance to find out ex actly what happened here. And yet, the head of the investigative team was told during the inves tigation to stop the investigation and not write a final report. I heard that many of the guards that reported this incident were sent off to Vietnam , as a matter of fact. I know for a fact - this I can attest to- that one of the guards that I sent out to the launch facilities and observed an object cam e back and was very shaken by the experience. And he was taken off guard duty from then on. He was sent som ewhere else because he was too shaken by the experience.

While at Malm strom AFB in Montana he again saw a message that said that a m etallic circular UFO was seen hovering near the m issile silos and that all the m issiles went off-line so that they could not be launched . DA: Lt. Col. Dwy yne Arneson SG: Dr. Steven Greer DA: My nam e is Dwy nne Arneson. I was born in Rochester, Minnesota back in 1937, and went to Rochester High School. From there I graduated and went on to St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota where I got my degree in phy sics and m ath. Upon graduation, I com peted for Officer’s Training School in the Air Force and then was selected to get a com mission, went to Officer’s Training School, and was com missioned back in 1962. I went on to spend twenty -six years in the U.S. Air Force as a com munication-electronics officer and retired in 1986. I had assignm ents all over the world, including Vietnam , Europe -- y ou nam e it, I’ve probably been there. I held a top-secret SCI-TK clearance. That m eans Special Com partm ented Tango Kilo inform ation, which is above top secret, if y ou will. It takes a special investigation to get that sort of a clearance. Upon getting out of the Air Force, and retiring as a colonel in 1986, I applied for work at Boeing, and I cam e to work for Boeing as a com puter sy stem s analy st, and I’ ve been working since 1987 in that capacity with Boeing. I retired in 1986 as Director of Logistics at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. I had various opportunities to see things that com e through m y perusal. One instance was back in 1962 when I was a lieutenant at Ram stein Air Force Base in Germ any . I was the cry pto officer for the entire Ram stein Air Base. I was a top-secret control officer. And in that capacity , I happened to see a classified m essage go through m y com center, which said that \"A UFO has crashed on the Island of Spitsbergen, Norway , and a team of scientists are com ing to investigate it.\" I do not recall where the m essage cam e from , wh ere it was going to, because in that capacity we were oftentim es told, \"What y ou see here, leave here.\" But I can recall seeing that. The next thing that com es to m ind is one that took place in 1967. I was in charge of the Com munication Center, the Twentieth Air Division at Malm strom Air Force Base, Montana. I was again the top-secret control officer there. I dispatched all the nuclear launch authentications to the SAC m issile crews, so -- I had a very good top-secret background. One day , I happened to see a m essage that cam e through my com munications center. There again, I cannot quote the date, where it cam e from , where it was going to, but I do recall reading it and seeing it. It said, basically , that \"A UFO was seen near m issile silos”... and it was 132"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":" hovering. It said that the crew going on duty and the crew com ing off duty all saw the UFO just hovering in m id-air. It was a m etallic circular object and from what I understand, the missiles were all shut down. And then later on, y ears later while working he re at Boeing, I heard from a m an nam ed, Bob Kam inisky , who had retired from Boeing and he said, \"Yes, I was the engineer assigned by Boeing to com e up and check out the missiles to make certain that they in fact had not gone down upon their own.\" And he said, \"I gave them a com plete bill of health.\" And I worked for Bob in Boeing and I was a good friend of his. Even before he passed away , we had m any , m any conversations on this subject, and he was just a very incredible m an. [See the testimony of Capt. Robert Salas re garding these ICBM missile events at Malmstrom AFB. SG] What I m ean by \"m issiles going down,\" is that they went dead. And som ething turned those missiles off, and so they could not be put in a m ode for launching. At another tim e, when I was Com mander of a radar squadron up in Maine, at Caswell Air Force Station, Maine, we were right next door to Loring Air Force Base. It was where they launch the B-52s and the KC tankers and things like that. I had a lot of security friends over there at Loring who told me about UFOs hovering near the nuclear weapon storage area on Loring Air Force Base. [This corroborates the testimony of Lieutenant Colonel Joe Wojtecki. See that testimony regarding a significant event at Loriing AFB. SG] A little bit of background, not to belabor the point, but -- when I was assigned as Director of Logistics at Wright-Patterson, I left the wife and kids back in Oklahom a City . It was my daughter’s last y ear of high school, so I went out there on my own for about a year. And in the search for an apartm ent out there, I cam e acro ss this lady , Chris Weedon by nam e, who had a little five-acre English manor outside of Day ton. She had three room s for rent, three bedroom s. So I rented one, and I kind of becam e her son. I helped her cut the grass, I mowed the lawn, etc. She was up in her seventies. Her husband was a Lieutenant Colonel Spencer W eedon. Now, he died about twelve y ears prior to that, and from every body that I met, they said he was just a brilliant guy . He had a photographic m ind, and he was one of the lead inves tigators of UFOs at Wright-Patterson. In fact I have a tape at hom e, produced back in the 1950s , of a debate between Spencer Weedon and that Major Donald Key hoe. It was done in the Arm strong Circle Theater. So he was her husband. The one person I happened to m eet and took quite a shine to, and he to m e, was a Dr. Adolph Raum . Now, he at that tim e was eighty -three y ear s old. I think he has since died. One night after supper and after a few m artinis, I jokingl y asked Adolph, \"What do y ou know about the little gray m en that are supposedly on ice here at Wri ght-Patterson?\" And I distinctly recall his face turning ashen white, his voice got very stern, and he said, \"Arne,\" he say s, \"all I can tell y ou is that they were not weather balloons, and we will not talk about it again. Do y ou understand?\" And there was no uncertainty in m y m ind that we wouldn’t talk about this further. He was from Switzerland originally . He was on the first A-Bom b test in the U.S. and he knew Dr. Oppenheim er personally . Even though I had a top-secret clearance, there were areas that we just 133"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":" couldn’ t get near, and we just could not find any thing about som e of these areas at Wright- Patterson that m ay have held som e bodies or -- who knows what they held? And a lot of m y technicians that worked for m e as a com munica tion electronics officer; would tell stories about objects going across their radar screens at fantastic speeds. Nothing we had could go that fast. SG: What y ears would this have been? DA: Well, this was back in the m id-seventi es when I had that radar squadron com mander’s job at Caswell Air Force Station, Maine. That’ s when these technicians would tell m e about events like that. As a com mander of a radar squadron, y ou ha ve people who are operational ty pes as well as the people who are the technician ty pes, who actua lly m aintain the radars. In fact, in that capacity , we would take and have battle exercises. We were the only radar squadron in the U.S. under operational control of the Canadian NORAD Division. Now, you’ d see the B-52s com ing down from Canada, the fighter interceptors being directed against them , or whatnot. So these men knew how fast things were fly ing. They knew the speed of bom bers. They knew the speed of the current fighter force that we had. Th e radar technicians I had, the m aintenance m en working for me -- they were in the position to say , \"Yes, that scope was in A-1 condition -- or the radar is in A-1 condition.\" So things could ch eck out. The experience of the operational ty pes, the experience of the m aintenance guy s -- they confirm ed that the sy stem was operating perfectly . And they said, \"That thing is going two or three thousand m iles an hour.\" I heard it from different sources that related sim ilar events at di fferent radar stations throughout the U.S., not just at Caswell Air Force Station. We had radar sta tions back in those day s all over the U.S. and stories like that are not uncom mon at all.

US Air Force Novem ber 2000 Professor Jacobs is a respected professor at a m ajor US university . In the 1960’ s he was in the Air Force. He was the officer in charge of optical instrum entation and his job was to film ballistic m issile tests launched from Vandenberg Air Force base in California. In 1964, during a test of the first m issile they film ed, they caught on film a UFO traveling right next to the m issile. He say s it looked like two saucers cupped together with a round ping-pong ball like surface on top. The film showed that from the ball a beam of light was directed at the m issile. This happened four tim es, from four different angles, as the missile was about 60 m iles up and traveling at 11,000 to 14,000 miles an hour. The m issile tum bled out of space and the UFO left. The next day he was shown the film by his com manding officer and was told to never speak of this again. He said, if it ever com es up y ou are to say that it was laser strikes from the UFO. Professor Jacobs thought this unusual because in 1964 lasers were in their infancy in the labs but he never the less agreed and hasn’ t talked about it for 18 years. Years later, after an article cam e out about the film , professor Jacobs started receiving harassing phone calls at early hours in the m orning. His mailbox was even blown up out in front of his house. What we photographed up at Vandenberg Air Force Base affected m e for the rest of my life and made a huge im pact on m y understanding of th e universe and of Governm ental m anipulation of our m inds. The background of this event is that we were testing ballistic m issiles that were to deliver nuclear weapons on target. That’s what they were there for. We weren’t launching real nuclear weapons we were launching dum my warheads. They were the exact size, shape, dim ension and weight of a nuclear warhead. I was the officer in charge of optical instrum entation at Vandenburg Air Force Base in the 1369 th photo squadron and as such it was m y duty to supervise the instrum entation photography of every m issile th at went down in that western test range. In those day s we called them ICBM’ s, inter-county ballistic m issiles, because m ost of them blew up on launch. And our job was to determ ine why they blew up, to provide the engineers good engineering sequential photography so that they could see what was wrong with the burners that took off in flight. For my achievem ent in setting up the photographic station to track these tests I was awarded the Air Force Guided Missile insignia. I was the first photographer in the Air Force to get the Missile Badge and it was a highly coveted thing at the tim e. The incident was definitely in 1964 because Ma jor Mansm ann confirm ed that; he had written it down and knew the exact date of it. They counted down the m issile and we heard e ngine ignition lift-off so we knew the m issile was underway . We were looking down south, southwest, and the m issile popped up through the fog. It was just beautiful and I hollered, there it is. Our guy s on our M45 tracking mount with a 180-inch lens on it film ed the missile. And the big BU telescope swung over and got it and we followed the thing. And sure enough we could see all three stages of powered flight boosters, they burned out and dropped away . And then of course, to our naked ey e all we saw was a sm oke trail going off into subspace as it head ed off towards its target which was an island in the Pacific. Well, that was our first film ing of a launch and we got it. 135"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":" We sent the film back down to the base and- I don’ t know exactly how long it was after the event, it might have been a day or two- I was called into Major Mansm ann’s office at the First Strategic Aerospace Division Headquarters. I walk ed into his office and they had a screen and a 16m m projector set up. There was a couch and Major Mansm ann said sit down. And there were two guy s in gray suits, civilian clothes, which was fairly unusual. Major Mansm ann said watch this and turned on the film projector. I watche d the screen and there was the launch from the day or two before. It was quite exciting. Because of the length of the telescope, as the Atlas m issile entered the fram e we could see the whole third stage. That w as pretty exciting optics. We watched that stage burnout. We watched the second stage burnout. We watched the third stage burnout. And then on that telescope we could see the dum my warhead. It’s fly ing along and into the fram e cam e som ething else. It flew into the fram e like a nd it shot a beam of light at the warhead. Now rem ember, all this stuff is fly ing at several thousand m iles an hour. So this thing [UFO] fires a beam of light at the warhead, hits it and th en it [the UFO] m oves to the other side and fires another beam of light, then m oves again and fir es another beam of light, then goes down and fires another beam of light, and then flies out the way it cam e in. And the warhead tum bles out of space. The object, the points of light that we saw, the warhead and so forth, were traveling through subspace about 60 m iles straight up. And they were going som ewhere in the neighborhood of 11,000 to 14,000 miles an hour when this UFO caught up to them , flew in, flew around them , and flew back out. Now, I saw that! I don’t give a Goddam n what any body else say s about it. I saw that on film ! I was there! Now when the lights cam e on, Major Mansm ann turned around looked at m e and said, were you guy s screwing around up there? And I said, no sir. And he said, what was that? And I said, it looks to me like we got a UFO. Now the thi ng that we saw, this object that flew in, was circular, was shaped like two saucers cupped together with a ping-pong ball on top. The beam of light cam e out of the ping-pong ball. That’s what I saw on film . Now Major Mansm ann said to m e after som e discussion about it, y ou are never to speak of this again. As far as y ou are concerned, this never happened. And he said, I don’t need to em phasize the dire consequences of a security breach, do I? I said, no sir. And he said, fine. This never happened. As I started for the door, he said, wait a m inute. He said, y ears from now if y ou are ever forced by som eone to talk about th is, you are to tell them it was laser strikes, laser tracking strikes. Well, in 1964 we didn’ t have any laser tracking strikes. We didn’ t have any laser tracking at all. Lasers were in their infancy in 1964. They were little play things in laboratories. So I said, yes sir, and walked out and that was the last I talked about it for 18 y ears. I didn’ t talk about it to any body at Vandenbur g Air Force Base, nobody in m y squadron knew about it. Nobody saw the film but m e. My Com manding Officer Major Lewis S. Clem ent, Jr. didn’ t see it. My Operations Officer Captain Kenneth R. Callahan didn’ t see it. His assistant Lieutenant Ronald O. Bay lor didn’ t see it. Their assistant, Chief Ward Officer Spooner didn’ t see it. Nobody in m y squadron saw it. And I didn’t talk about it to any body under direct orders from Major Florence J. Mansm ann, Jr. Consequen tly no one at Vandenburg that I know of knows any thing about this. 136"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":" That sounds real suspicious doesn’ t it? Som ebody should have seen it. Som ebody should have talked about it. Well, they didn’ t because in those day s, I didn’ t talk about top-secret things that I was told not to talk about. There are things that I know about that I did in the service that I won’ t talk about to y ou now because they are top-secret and I could get my ass in trouble for talking about them . After 18 years it occurred to me that I could talk about this one incident because nobody ever told m e it was classified top-secret. If y ou parse what Major Mansm ann said, he said, you are to say this never happened. Well, that’ s not classify ing it top-secret, is it? That’ s why I felt free to talk about it. It’ s not a secondhand story . This happened to m e. And I was a part of a United States Air Force cover-up for 18 y ears. After an article [ cam e out about the incident] , th e shit hit the fan! I started being harassed at work. I started getting odd telephone calls that w ould com e during the day . At night, at my house I would get telephone calls- all night long som etim es 3:00 in the morning, 4:00 in the morning, midnight, 10:00, people would call and start scream ing at m e. You are going down mother fucker! You are going down m other fucker! And that’s all they would say . And they ’d keep scream ing that until I finally hung up the phone. One night som ebody blew up m y m ail box by putting a big load of sky rockets in it. The mailbox went up in flam es. And that night at 1:00 in the m orning the phone rang. I picked it up and som ebody said, sky rockets in y our box at night, oh what a beautiful sight, m other fucker! And things like that have happened on and off si nce 1982. I told y ou that since this History Channel thing cam e up and since y ou’ve started ask ing questions and this thing is in the wind again, I’m starting to get telephone calls again. My wife and I get phone calls out here in nowhere {___} where we’ve retreated out to our farm . And it’s strange – They don’t say any thing. You pick up the phone and say hello, hello, a nd there’ s a h mmmmmmmmmmmmmm, click. It’s disconcerting. But I’ve learned to not give a flip. I just don’t care any more. What are they going to do kill m e? What are they going to do discredit m e? Are they going to do any more than Philip Klass has already done to me? Ar e they going to m ake m e look foolish? That’ s about all they can do. I believe this nutty fringe around UFO’s is part of a concerted effort to keep serious study of it down. Any tim e any body tries to study this subject seriously , we are subject to ridicule. I’m a full professor at a relatively m ajor university . And I’m certain that m y colleagues at the university laugh at m e and hoot and holler behind m y back when they hear that I have an interest in study ing unidentified fly ing objects- and that’s just one of the things that we have to live with. The Air Force denied every thing. Was I in the Air Force? The Air Force denied it. Was I ever at Vandenburg? Well of course I couldn’ t be because if I wasn’ t in the Air Force how could I have been at Vandenburg? Did I put a tracking site up along the California coast? No, there was no tracking site in California. Which is a croc k! The tracking site is still there right where I put it. And they use it to show y ou every tim e th e space shuttle lands in California- that’ s where you first see it from . And they are still photographing missiles from Vandenburg from that tracking site. At any rate, to corroborate my story , Lee Graham tracked down Florence J. Mansm ann, Jr., the sam e Major who had ordered m e to shut-up about it and he was now a Ph.D. at Stanford and a 137"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":" rancher in Fresno, California. And he wrote back to Lee say ing every thing Bob said in his story is absolutely true. He corroborated m y story and he continued to do that y ear after y ear, every tim e som ebody brought it up, every tim e som ebody would contact him he corroborated m y story by say ing, yes, that’ s exactly what happened. It takes a lot of guts to do that. I becam e a fan of Sonny ’s [Mansm ann] ; he is now deceased. He was m y hero for a while. I wasn’t in the room at the tim e but what happened to the film is an interesting story in itself as Major Mansm ann related to m e and other peopl e. Som e tim e after I had gone, the guy s in civilian clothes- I thought it was the CIA but he said no, it wasn’t the CIA, it was som ebody else- took the film and they spooled off the part that had the UFO on it and they took a pair of scissors and cut it off. They put that on a separate reel. They put it in their briefcase. They handed Major Mansm ann back the rest of the film and said here, I don’t need to rem ind y ou Major of the severity of a security breach; we’ ll consider this in cident closed. And they walked off with the film . Major Mansm ann never saw it again. And as far as I’m concerned nobody else ever saw it again certainly not at Vandenburg. I’m certain that it left Vandenburg and went som ewh ere else. Major Mansm ann, who’s a very good reader of film , said it m ust have been extraterrest rial. They assum ed that the beam of light that struck the dum my warhead was som e sort of pl asm a beam because it looked like a plasm a beam . Major Mansm ann was a m an of great honor and great scientific standing in the com munity . For him to corroborate it is good enough for m e. Even if I didn’t believe myself, I would believe Major Mansm ann. So there were two of us who were Air Force Officers at the tim e and we saw som ething and we both corroborated with each other that we saw it. And what I have to ask skeptics or people who disbelieve what I’m say ing is why would I make this up? Why would Major (and Doctor) Mansm ann m ake it up? What have we to gain? I’ve got nothing but pain and suffering out of it, out of talking about it. I’ve been harassed at m y hom e. This was used against m e, partially in losing a job once in teaching. I’ ve had a hell of a tim e after I’ ve told this story but I continue to tell the story because I think it is im portant for people to understand that this sort of shit goes on in the Governm ent. That the Governm ent cove rs up inform ation that we are entitled to know about as citizens of this country . That’s why I tell m y story . That’s why I’m telling it to y ou. Now, I’ ll continue to tell it as long as I’ m alive. And I’ ll alway s tell it the sam e way because it only happened one way . I never vary the story because I can’ t; it’ s the truth. And I’ ve been the subject of hum iliating letters and phone calls from skeptics like Jam es O’Berg at NASA and Phillip J. Klass, who’ s a paid inform ant of th e United States Governm ent who persisted in belittling m e. And that’s fine if they want to belittle m e but don’t belittle Sonny Mansm ann! The Air Force’ s position right now is there was no such incident and there was no film of it. The thing that’s im portant to m e about this whole operation is very sim ply this: the biggest event in the history of hum ankind is the discovery that we are not alone, that there are other living entities- intelligent entities- in this universe and that we aren’t here alone. That’s a huge, enorm ous discovery . It’s the discovery of the lifetim e of hum ankind, isn’t it, to find out that we’ re not here alone? That’ s why I think it is im por tant to talk about these things. I think that’ s exciting. And I think that it’s im portant for us as hum ans to com e to term s, to grow-up and recognize that we m ay not be the paragon of anim als after all. That there m ay be som ething out 138"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":" there that’ s bigger and m ore exciting than we are. And that just m aybe, just m aybe they are telling us som ething.

That’ s probably the message I would interpret from that. May be som ebody doesn’ t want us annihilating Moscow; maybe we should stop doing that. [I have interviewed many military officers who have reached the same conclusion after extraterrestrial vehicles have appeared at nuclear facilities: Maybe oth ers have evolved to the point of interstellar travel and know how dangerous these weapons are and understand their use would end our civilization. And they certainly do not want us going into space with such weapons. SG] Ronald Reagan one night went on television and did a m ost astonishing thing: He stood up in front of Am erica and said we are going to build a defensive shield, we are going to call it SDI, the strategic defense initiative, and its m ission is going to be to protect us, to protect all of us. Ronald Reagan said we are going to share this with every body . We are going to share it with the Russians- our enem ies, the guy s that only a few y ears ago we were pretending to annihilate. Now suddenly we are going to protect them with a shield. From who are we going to protect them ? Perhaps that was the first shot across the bow , the first warning shot from som ebody say ing, knock this off kids it’s tim e to grow-up. You don’t want to annihilate this planet, do y ou?

During that period of tim e one of m y functions was to accom pany a security team which visited all of the nuclear facilities to check on the security of weapons. And we were getting reports of visits by UFOs over the storage facilities and even som e of the m anufacturing facilities. And that went on continuously ... And so, then after that siege which went thr ough the entire ‘50s, I was assigned to the Unified Com mand under Adm iral Felt during the ‘60s. I was the officer in charge of the Alternate com mand post involved with nuclear weapons operation planning. During that period of tim e, I maintained contacts with NORAD, with the SA C operations, and was i nvolved with operational plans for the use of nuclear weapons. And during this period of tim e, I also learned of a num ber of incidents which happened involving UFOs. And then further on I finally retired from the Air Force and joined the Boeing Com pany where I was assigned to the Minute Man program where I was responsible for the accounting of all the nuclear fleet, the Minute Man One, Two, and Three.

It was m y understanding that in either the very end of the ‘70s or the early ‘80s that we attem pted to put a nuclear weapon on the Moon and explode it for sci entific m easurem ents and other things which was not acceptable to the extraterrestrials. SG: And what happened? RD: The ETs destroy ed the weapon as it went to ward the Moon. The idea of any explosion of a nuclear weapon in space by any Earth governm ent was not acceptable to the extraterrestrials and that has been dem onstrated over and over. SG: How was that dem onstrated? RD: By the destruction of any nuclear weapon sent into space. ... And then later on our visits to Los Alam os and Liverm ore we found that people were interested in the extraterrestrial technology , very m uch so.

Trained in opera tions intelligence, he has a classified clearance and also worked in electronic count erm easures. He testifies that as a radar operator on the Roosevelt, he had a radar contact with a huge object above 65,000 feet traveling at about 1,000 knots. The Captai n launched two Phantom -2 aircraft to investigate. As the Phantom s approached the UFO, it disappeared and about half an hour later it re-appeared but this tim e closer to the ship. He described the intim idation which followed the event. He later found out that in the prior y ear the Roosevelt had a huge UFO event that was photographed where people saw a saucer descend from the clouds. This happened m ore frequently afte r the Roosevelt took on nuclear weapons. Many years after Mr. Jordan was discharged from the Navy , he say s that he was listening in on his HAM radio to the Space Shuttle STS 48 com munications when he heard them speaking about seeing an alie n spacecraft. He describes the harassm ent which followed after it was known what he had heard. ...Any way , I was on m id-watch during m y second m ed-cruise. It was oh, som etim e between midnight and 2:00am . And I had a contact com e on the radarscope... This target was above 65,000 feet and the strength of the signal was as strong as the surface contact on the water of an aircraft carrier so th is contact was huge. It got m y attention and the attention of others that were on watch. There were four enlisted on watch and two officers at the tim e that this occurred. We challenged it and ch ecked the codes out. It was not com mercial. And then it began to m ove fairly slowly at first, and then very quickly . It was doing better than 1,000 knots. The first tim e I picked it up on radar it was hovering, it was stationary . Then it was doing about 1,000 knots. Then when we tried to m ake contact it was over 500 m iles away ... In this particular case it was showing up on height finding equipm ent and it was showing up on radar equipm ent. The CO cam e in and he wa nted to know what the heck was going on here. And they looked at it and asked what the hell was that, y ou know? And it got the attention of the Captain at that tim e, Captain Clark- m y com mander was Com mander Gibson. There was only one person on watch in ECM and in the m atter of 15 minutes the ship was being turned and two Phantom -2’s were being prepared for launch. Now I got on a set of headphones and I’m on a SPA 8 repeater now. And I’m listening to com munications between the pilots and the CO f light ops. And when y ou go to general quarters you do the sam e thing and I was used to doing this because one of my jobs during general quarters was to sit right next to the com mander of our division and to listen to the aircraft. My job was to log in all the tally -ho’s and every thing [a tally -ho is when contact is m ade with the target by the fighter pilot] . My job was as a recognition expert, also-to be able to identify different types of navy ships, foreign ships, co mmercial ships, m aritim e ships, and aircraft. Not only electronically but visually and be fam iliar with electronic fingerprints. In any event, the Phantom -2’s went to after-burners. And they were about 100 miles or so away from this contact and turned on the conical scan radar to lock on and it winked out. Just 148"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":" disappeared. I could see the two Phantom -2’s on m y scope and this thing winked out. They flew around for about 10 m inutes and then they headed back to the ship. After they landed, about 35 m inutes later, this thing winks back on again and it’s about 12 to 15 m iles from the ship, hovering at about 30,000 feet... Of course I couldn’ t say any thing. I didn’ t say any thing because I was told by m y CO that, Jordan, y ou know, what y ou have in y our log, th is never happened. And I wasn’t the only one there on watch that night. So any body who was there at that tim e knows what I’m talking about and knows that it’ s the truth. But less than a dozen people knew what went on that night. And that ship had 5,000 m en on it... In this case, the radar contact was not leaving any kind of a heat signature. It was not leaving any kind of a trail. It was not m oving at an usual speed. This thing was m oving 10, 15 miles in 30 seconds, 20 m iles, then 30 m iles, then 40 m iles, then 100 m iles. And in three and one-half minutes this thing m oved alm ost 500 m iles. And then it was m oving from one altitude to another in a way that would cause any norm al pilot to black out. This was a real contact. This signal from this contact at that distance and that altitude was sending back a signal as strong as the Roosevelt itself and the Roosevelt was over 1,000 feet long. A Lieutenant Com mander whom I didn’t know very well cam e over and he asked, you know, what was up Jordan? What have y ou got in y our l og? And he say s, y ou don’t need to put that in there. Now to me that was highly irregular, highly irregular to say that particularly on a ship’ s logs. I did have the contact logged in there. And I started writing in UFO... Years later during the [Space Shuttle] STS 48 m ission, while they were in orbit, I was listening on the HAM radio. I have an OMNI antennae and the astronauts were say ing, ‘we have the UFO under observation’ . And then I heard them say we have the alien spacecraft under observation. I was one of the HAM operators who did hear that. So I called Dr. Kasher about that, he is a friend of m ine who had a son going to school where I teach, and I told him they are talking about alien spacecraft. They actually use that term over the airway s. And it just stunned me. It just stunned m e... Later I saw Inter-Agency cars right across the street and guy s in suits taking pictures of me. They also took pictures of m e and m y wife in Kansas City when we were at Worlds of Fun. I told other people about this because I got very skittis h about what was going on here. I took down the license num ber of the vehicle and it was registered at an Air Force Base. I also had an Air Force Intelligence Officer visit m e at m y house...

So I im mediately called the facilities control on the intercom to inform them that my broadcast was out and they inform ed me that they were busy because all com munications had just gone out, ship-wide. This had never occurred before. We had an intercom and a pneum atic tube sy stem that went between the com munications room to the signal bridge, which is located at the very top of the island structure of the carrier. And we heard a very excited voice com e on y elling that “God was here. It was the end of the world.” And we looked at each other and thought that that was strange. What was going on there? Another few seconds went by and anothe r voice cam e on, m ore controlled. This person said that there was som ething over the ship. Well, I looked at a friend of m ine, a shipm ate, and he looked at m e and we decided to go have a look... So we exited the Com munications Center and went to the catwalk on the port side of the ship on the edge of the flight deck and we observed a large glowing sphere over the ship. It was hard to decide what size this thing was because there was no perspective. It was late in the evening. The sun had gone down, it was twilight, but it looked huge... After that, I talked to a few shipm ate friends that I had on the ship. One in particular worked in the radar departm ent and he was on watch during the incident. He told m e that all the radar screens were glowing- and then nothing. They couldn’t detect any thing on radar. We stay ed up most of the night talking about it.

The UFO was only over the ship for m aybe five m inutes or less however the ram ifications of the disruptions lasted for at least an hour. That is why we stay ed at battle stations for two hours.

There were no aircraft in the air. They were all on board when the incident started. They kept two F-4 Phantom s, which were called a Ready CAP, Com bat Air Patrol.

Testim ony of Lieutenant Colonel Joe Wojtecki October 2000 Lt. Colonel Wojtecki spent 20 years in the Air Force and retired in 1988. He spent m ost of his tim e with Strategic Air Com mand and Tactical Air Com mand. He tells of a night in April of 1969 while stationed at Loring AFB in Maine when he and his flight instructor both saw three very bright lights in a perfect equilateral triangle silently m oving across th e sky . They estim ated that this UFO was lower than 3,000 feet. He discovered the next m orning when he reported for duty that for six hours, a UFO was seen hovering over a group of B-52’ s containing nuclear weapons. Every tim e a plane drew near to the lights, they would part and m ove in way s that were very unconventional. When the planes left, the lights cam e together again and focused on the group of B-52’s. Many years later Lt. Col. Wojtecki attended a lecture given by SG and saw a photograph of a UFO that was the exact configuration that he had seen y ears earlier. 151"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":" JW: Lt. Col. Joe Wojtecki SG: Dr. Steven Greer JW: ...As we got out of the car my flight instructor was looking back to the northeast in the direction of the runway and said, what is that? And I looked up in the direction he was looking in the sky over the runway . What we saw were three very bright but independent lights. I m ean, three separate lights; we assum ed they were indepe ndent. And they were in a perfect equilateral triangle with the point south and the other two point s of the triangle directly behind it to the north. The curious thing about this form ation of lights that caused us to watch it for an extended period of tim e -- 10 or 15 m inutes we watched it -- was that first, it was silent. Second, it was moving slowly but in a perfectly constant altitude, perf ectly constant velocity , and perfectly constant direction from north to south. We pieced togeth er later it was actually com ing from the direction where m y flight instructor had reported seeing the flash of light earlier... The next m orning I reported for duty . This would now have been the m orning of April 18 th . The first duty I had each day was to report to a wing stand-up briefing in the wing com mand post. This was a Strategic Air Com mand base equipped with, as I recall, three squadrons of B-52’ s, two squadrons of 135’s, and a s quadron of F-106 interceptors. When I arrived at the com mand post the next m orning about 6:30 in the morning, it was unusually active and unusually well staffed. In fact, it was a beehive of activity . And there were people who had obviously been there m ost of the night from their general appearan ce and apparent level of frustration. So I very quickly learned that what had been occurring during the night began at about the tim e my flight instructor and I saw these lights. And it seem s that these lights did position them selves over the alert force of the B-52’ s, over the alert pad of a num ber of B-52’s configured for their wartim e mission should they be required to perform it. Therefore this was a very sensitive area, naturally .... And as sorties returned, I was told by those who had been there overnight they were asked to close with and try to identify these lights. And this included B-52’ s, KC 135’ s and som e of the F- 106 interceptors that had been out during their particular training m issions. And the pattern was the sam e: each tim e an aircraft would approach, th e lights would part in way s that defied any aerody nam ic knowledge that any body there had or could explain. There was rapid acceleration, rapid changes in direction including vertical. They were doing things that som ething that is fly ing by the rules of aerody nam ics that we understand would not have been at able to do. Then alway s to return to their point of interest which was the ai rcraft in the alert area. And then at som e point late in the night, early in the m orning their curiosity was satisfied and they took off very expeditiously in a straight line and were gone. I would be guessing how m any hours this whol e event took from beginning to end but it was probably in the range of six and perhaps m ore hours in duration. So I filed it away . And I just m used about it and I discussed it with a few people over the years but not too many . Until a day in the early 1990’s -- I forget the exact y ear and date but it was about ‘93 or ‘94 -- that I had occasion to attend a lecture by Dr. Steven Greer in Ham pton, Virginia. And saw a photograph of what I now understand is a very fam iliar sighting am ong those who have been privileged to actually see a UFO. And when I saw the photograph, I literally jum ped out of m y seat, grabbed m y wife by the hand and I said, that’ s it. That is exactly what I had seen nearly 25 y ears ago, at that point . But to see that picture just brought back the im age so strikingly clear that there was no doubt in m y m ind that that was exactly what we had seen over the runway in April of 1969. And it was only then that I had any notion that it was in fact a single m achine not three independent m achines. 152"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":" I will deduce with som e degree of knowledge th at they m ust have been because of the repeated attem pts of returning aircraft to clo se with them , from distances and altitudes where they couldn’ t have acquired them visually because of the low ceiling that night. So I would deduce from that fact that they were being tracked on radar, both ground control ra dar and airborne radar on the aircraft that were returning to base. It would be a very reasonable deduction to say that they were easily being tracked on radar... I do rem ember very clearly that no aggressive action was taken by the Air Force by any body at the wing in response to the lights because they in fact showed no aggressive or threatening behavior whatsoever. They were sim ply in airsp ace that was restricted ai r space. But they were not doing any thing that would prom pt any sort of a security response... SG: Was it bigger than a conventional plane? JW: Oh absolutely . That’s why I was so surp rised when I saw the photograph to learn that those lights which were so far apart could conceivably be part of a single m achine. And why I naturally assum ed, and for all those y ears belie ved, I had seen three separate m achines operating independently - although their form ation was so perf ect that in retrospect, clearly there is no reason to assum e they were three, except that for them to be part of one un it it would have to have been so enorm ously large com pared to any thing. And at that tim e, B-52’ s were considered pretty big airplanes. And this of course dwarfed any thing that would have been part of a B-52.

In the sum mer of 1967 he was guarding a B-52 at a SAC AFB in Oklahom a when suddenly , directly over one of the B-52’ s, a huge bluish haze appeared.

I was on guard duty , guarding a B-52 bom ber in the bom ber area, which is divided in two sections with what we called the Hurry House in the middle. And that’ s where the officers and the flight crew stay on ready if they are on alert to disburse to the planes quickly . This would have been in the sum mer of 1967, som etim e in the sum mer period. There were approxim ately four planes on each side.

This is, of course, explosive tes tim ony . It establishes the reality of the phenom enon and also of the fact that we have been study ing this phenom enon for y ears.

In fact there have been multiple events, at least a couple of dozen, where objects of extraterrestrial origin have b een downed, acquired, and studied. We believe that this is som ething which is of extrem e im portance because one cannot consider that covert program s -- having spent hundreds of billions of dollars over the decades on research and developm ent, so-called \"reverse engin eering\" or \"back engineering\" extraterrestrial technologies -- have not had significant breakthroughs.

Testim ony of Astronaut Gordon Cooper 1999 [We are grateful to Mr. Fox for sharing this interview with us.] Gordon Cooper was one of the original Mercury Seven astronauts and the last Am erican to fly into space alone. In his testim ony he recounts how he observed UFOs fly ing in the sam e form ation as his fighter group over the skies of Germ any These UFOs m ade m aneuvers that could not be done by conventional fighters. He felt they must have be under intelligent control to co mmunicate with one another due to the ty pe of m aneuvers they were m imicking. At another tim e, while film ing conventional aircraft perform ing precision landings, a sau cer flew directly overhead and landed ahead of them on a dry lakebed. The entir e event was film ed including detailed close- ups. The film was sent back to Washington and was never returned. GC: Gordon Cooper JF: Jam es Fox GC: These objects [UFOs] kept com ing over fly ing in the sam e kind of form ation that we fly in our fighters while we were fly ing in Germ any . We were fly ing F-86’s. They would com e over and do the sam e maneuvers that we made except every once in a while one of them would go zip, and m ake a m aneuver that y ou can’t do in a conventional fighter. What started it was that the weatherm an was tracking a weather balloon and he saw these objects with his binoculars. That started peopl e getting out and looking at them and we decided to put som e airplanes out and see what they were . But we couldn’ t get to them . They were 165"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":" higher and faster. So we couldn’t tell whether they were large and far away or sm aller and closer in.

JF: Do y ou think the Russians had that kind of technology back then [ that could do this] ? GC: No. JF: You definitely determ ined that they were objects that were under intelligent control? GC: Well, yes. They weren’t just random . They were fly ing fighter form ations very definitely under control. JF: Can y ou describe what they looked like? GC: They were just ty pical saucer shaped, double saucer shaped, and m etallic looking. I think they were definitely piloted vehicles. Each one of them had a pilot in it. I think they were very definitely in com munication with one another because they would m ake a turn such that they had to be in com munication to be coordinated. One would zip off to the side, do a lateral maneuver off to the side... Later at Edwards Air Force Base I was having som e of the cam eram en film precision landings and we were right on the edge of a dr y lake. A saucer flew right over them , put down three landing gears, and landed out on the dry lake bed. They went out there with their cam eras ... towards the UFO. It lifted off, put the gear back in the well, and flew off at a very high rate of speed and disappeared. So while I was going through all of the regula tion books and finding out the num ber to call in Washington to report this, I had the cam eram an go over and develop the film . By the tim e they got back with the developed film I had higher a nd higher and higher level officers talking to m e. Finally , a Colonel told m e that when the film arri ved on m y desk to put it in a courier file. There would be a courier there at m y office and they would arrange for him to fly in our base airplane back to Washington with these film s. [The Colonel said] to not run prints, etc., etc., etc. So we stuck them in the courier packets. JF: Did y ou watch the film ? GC: We didn’t have a chance to run it.

In m y opinion, I think they were worried it would panic the public if they kne w that som eone had vehicles that had this kind of perform ance way back right after WWII. So they started telling lies about it. Then I think they had to cover it with another lie, tell anothe r lie to cover their first lie and now they don’t know how to get out of it. Now it is going to be so em barrassing to adm it that all of these adm inistrations have told a lot of untruths. It will be em barrassing to get out of it. JF: Do y ou think they want to get it out? GC : I think that basically each and every President would probably like to get out of it, com e clean on the deal and not have to continue to tell untruths. Eventually som ething is going to happen that will m ake all of them have egg a ll over their faces and they are going to have to adm it that they haven’t been truthful at all.

[When asked about m eeting with the United Na tions Secretary General about UFOs in the 1970s, Gordon Cooper say s:] Kurt Waldheim was rea lly interested in the subject and he thought that it would be a good idea to form a com mittee and to do the investigation at that level [ of the UN] but nothing ever got done. It was ty pical of the U.N. They talked a good gam e but they never get around to doing any thing about it. By NASA’s own figures there are som e 400,000 other planets out there that could be habitable. I just can’t believe that God would inhabit this one planet and then leave all of those others bare. In m y personal opinion, I just feel th at we are out here in the hinterland of all of the galaxies. We are way out in the sticks. All of these other galaxies are closer to one another. I think they probably have a lot of travel to and from one another. Once in a while we will get a few travelers or stragglers or com e through from distant other galaxies. I wrote a letter [to the UN] suggesting that we form a group at the U.N. level and start gathering inform ation around the world and let it be handled and coordinated at that level.

I think that som e of them undoubtedly have crews in them and in m y opinion I think those people are probably very sim ilar to us. I think definitely there was som ething other than a weather balloon that crashed at Roswell. JF: Do y ou think the truth was lost? GC: I think the truth has been very subm erged in all of the lies that have been told. JF: Do y ou think they would cover up one of those saucers that y ou saw? GC: Very likely . I would like to think that they reverse-engineered it, did som ething of benefit with it. That would be the logical thing to do. JF: Did y ou know where that footage went of the fly ing saucer that landed on the tarm ac? GC: It went to Washington; that is all I know. JF: Did y ou ever keep in touch with any body about it, or discuss it? GC: How would I keep in touch with any body ? There is no way in the m ilitary or within the governm ent of keeping track of som ething that is classified unless y ou are directly involved in it and I was not. I had no way of knowing what happened. JF: Was it included in part of the Project Blue Book investigation? GC: No, it was not. And that was one of the com plaints that I had about Project Blue Book. In m y opinion, Project Blue Book was totally a whitewash. [Other high level witnesses such as Colonel Brown and Dr. Wood have concluded the same: Blue Book was a PR whitewash while th e real research went on elsewhere. SG] There were a num ber of other things that I ha d occasion to know about that were not included in the Blue Book either. In m y opinion, I think they are com ing from som e other planet. There is no doubt in m y m ind. I think they are for real and I think that eventually we will find out that there is regular travel to this Earth from other planets. Who was fly ing these vehicles we saw? I think there were extraterrestrial pilots fly ing them , no doubt about it. [When asked about ‘black’ or invisible projects, Gordon Cooper say s:] That was one reason that we did the U-2 Program the way we did it. We had put no classifications on that program because when y ou classify a program then a Congressm an or a Senator thinks they can go out and tell all of the details. They are privileged to be able to do that. They tram ple all over security and tell the details to whom ever they want to. We didn’ t classify it at all until Gary Powers was shot down. The world really didn’ t know about the U-2. At least in the United States we didn’ t know about them . 168"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":" [Cooper and others have told me of projects b eyond classification and Colonel Corso spoke of the E.

Extremely tightly held unacknowledged projects such as those dealing with UFOs rea lly are beyond top-secret and access is blocked to Congress and the public. SG ] I think we have a lot of potential learning from them [the extraterrestrials] . If we can just set up the schedule of how to go about doing it. They can com e land in m y backy ard any tim e. If they want to com e land in m y backy ard I would welcom e them . I think they are just the sam e as we are just a little higher, a little better, and a little faster. I have a good friend who is a com mercial airline pilot and he has had about three different occasions where a UFO has pulled up right alongside his wing and stay ed in form ation with him . He is in a m ajor airline. The airline has a polic y that their crews aren’t allowed to talk about UFOs. Testimony of Brigadier General Steven Lovekin, Esq. October 2000 Brigadier General Lovekin entered the m ilita ry in 1958. In 1959 he joined the White House Arm y Signaling Agency and served under President Eisenhower and then under President Kennedy with an above top secret clearance. He was fam iliar with Project Blue Book and related how that project doc um ented highly scientific and specific UFO cases from very reliable sources. They reviewed photos taken from Air Force pilots, Marine Air Corps pilots, and som e foreign pilo ts and m ultiple reports of radar lock-ons. He was also shown a piece of metallic debris taken from the Roswell crash. While working under President Eisenhower, he discove red that Eisenhower had a keen interest in UFO’s, but that Eisenhower cam e to reali ze that he had lost control of the subject. SL: Brigadier General Steven Lovekin SG: Dr. Steven Greer SL: I graduated from the George School, which is a private co-educational prep school in Philadelphia, in 1958 and went into the m ilitary . After going through advanced infantry training, I was transferred to the Pentagon where I worked for the Radio Frequency Engineering Office. I finished there and then joined the White House Arm y Signaling Agency in May of 1959. I served under Eisenhower from May of 1959 until he got out of office and then I served under Kennedy until I left the service in August of 1961. My job was to learn to deal with code [and code breaking] . In the process of dealing with that I learned a lot about Project Bluebook [ which deals with UFOs] . Bluebook was discussed quite openly in the office. Sections of Blue book were opened for discussion. There were other matters as well that were brought to our attention: One afternoon when we were just about ready to finish up training, Colonel Holom on brought out a piece of what appeared to be m etallic debris; it looked like a y ardstick. It had inscripti ons on it. And the inscriptions were pointed out by Colonel Holom on to each one of us who were in that class (I think that there were six or seven of us at that tim e). We were told that th is object cam e from m atters connected to Operation Bluebook. What they were try ing to say was, “Look, we have this phy sical evidence to go along with what y ou have seen in Bluebook; we have now been able to get our hands on and show y ou this material” and that is what he did. He went on to further explain that this was the m aterial that had com e from a New Mexico crash in 1947 of an extr aterrestrial craft and that was discussed at 169"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":" length. If I am not m istaken, we spent perhaps a nother hour or so discussing this. The next day it was discussed again. He did not describe what the bodies looked like, although they did discuss the fact that there were bodies, extraterrestrial bodies. There were either three or five bodies... three or five stands out in m y m ind as the num ber that was taken. One was partially alive at the tim e that this happened and I do not know what m ay have happened to him after that. The Air Force at that tim e was very , very m uch concerned with Bluebook and there were strict regulations involving any thing that had to do with the reporting of UFOs or talking about a UFO. If y ou wanted to ruin y our career, it was explained to us, the thing that would do this the fastest was to talk about UFO’s. I was enliste d then and was the lowest thing down on the totem pole. We were being groom ed for Top Secret and above, and that we certainly would not be cleared for any kind of confidential m aterial should this inform ation be released. We saw an awful lot. We saw a lot of pictures of UFOs. Som e pictures that I saw I think were m aybe a little bit better than the ones y ou see today . These pictures of UFOs were taken by Air Force pilots. SG: So y ou saw official pictures the m ilitary took of UFO’s? SL: Oh, indeed they did. Yes. Not only did the Air Force take these pictures but also som e were taken by civilian pilots -- and som e were ta ken by Marine Air Corps pilots and som e were foreign. It was m ade quite clear that there were a num ber of others that were in place in other agencies that were being used at that tim e that were not being put in the Bluebook. I inferred from that that perhaps those pictures were better than the pictures that they were showing us. I think that Colonel Holom on gave that im pression to every body in the class. [See the testimony of Colonel Charles Brown of Project Grudge who also confirms that the really significant evidence was compartmented out side of Blue Book and in some cases even Grudge. SG] This piece of an extraterrestrial craft was a gray ish foil-like material maybe eight to ten inches long or so. It seem ed giant-like because it was the first tim e that I had ever seen any thing like this before and all ey es were just peeled on that particular thing. And when he told us what it was it was frightening. It was eerie. You could have heard a pin drop in the room when it was first m entioned. SG: And what did he tell y ou it was? SL: Well, he said that it had been taken from one of the ET craft that had crashed in New Mexico and that it had been taken from a box of m aterials that the m ilitary was working on. They didn’ t use the word “reverse engineering” at th at tim e but it was som ething sim ilar to reverse engineering that they felt like they needed to wo rk on and it was going to take y ears to do this. I do rem ember that at the Arm y Engineers at Ft. Belvoir, they were doing a lot of experim entation and that surprised m e. It surprised m e an awful lot. The inscriptions looked like hierogly phics. It is hard to describe hierogly phics but if you have ever seen any ancient Egy ptian writings y ou will know that the hierogly phics were anim ated in som e form and these appeared to be anim ated. If I knew the code that was supposed to be used to find out how this language was to be interpre ted then we could understand it. The writing was very expressive, y ou could tell it was expressive. 170"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":" [Lovekin explained at another time that his group in the Pentagon was shown this item as an example of advanced, difficult to break code. SG] He had a stainless steel box with a lock on it alm ost like a carpenter’ s box but maybe bigger. And that is where he got this from and that is wh ere he put it back. And I gathered that was not the only thing that was in that box. But that is the only thing that he did show. This occurred in the Radio Frequency Engineering Office. At the Pentagon, y ou have to rem ember, we ha d one instructor, a Lieutenant Colonel. And his job was to not only teach us but to m ake us believers as well and that is when he produced that piece of m aterial from what appeared to be a stainless steel box. It was m aybe a kind of a dusty gray like-foil and it looked like it may have been burned on a grill. He indicated that that was not the only piece of inform ation that he had and the only object that he had. He had several others. May be the whole box was filled. I don’ t know, but that is the only piece that he took out to show us. And the reason he did this was to m ake sure that we understood we were dealing with som ething that was totally out of context from what we had been dealing with earlier but that we m ight be dealing with in the future. I think he intended for us to know that our futures were going to be dealing with this subject m atter m ore and m ore. He did describe the inscriptions as being sy mbols of instruction and that is as far as he would go but he did infer that the instructions, whatever they m ight have been, were som ething that was im portant enough for the m ilitary to keep working on a constant basis. He m ade it quite clear that this was som ething that was of grave im portance. We were in the basem ent of the Pentagon and in those day s. That was in 1959; there was a trem endous am ount of security there in that area of the Pentagon. And any body who has worked th ere knows what I am talking about. You could alm ost carry on an entire war in the basem ent and no one else would know what was going on on the floors above. That is how secure it was. I was working on top-secret clearance. I had gotten a secret clearance and by the tim e I finished the school I had been given a top-secret one but I was given one step higher than that because at that tim e they didn’ t have a clearance specifically dealing with this (UFO) problem . If you dealt with a problem you got a Q Clearance, which was a nuclear clearance. May be later on they decided that they were going to change that but I rem embered that that was the big question, “How are we going to give security clearances to these people who have been through this course? ” There were probably 1,500 reported cases at that tim e that were eligible to be put in Bluebook. The findings that were put in there were highly scientific. This inform ation was inform ation that would never get out to any one else but it was designed for the use of particular military personnel. So what was there was ex trem ely exact and specific. These cases were as bona fide as they possibly could be. They were talking about people who had sterling reputations either in the military or in the civilian capacity of som e form or another but they were not taking any loose cannons. This was inform ation they thought was extrem ely accurate. There were stories about radar lock on. Several of those stories cam e out of Ohio at Wright Patterson Air Force Base but several others cam e from California, Texas, and Washington from what I can recall. I would estim ate that there probably were between two and three hundred cases of radar lock on [with UFOs] . That is why tho se cases were in there because they were authentic. I was told that the m aterial they showed us cam e from the New Mexico site but there were other sites and there were other crashes of ET craft. They did not say where. They were not 171"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":" pinpointed but it was made quite clear that that was not the only site that they had gathered inform ation from and also m aterial. [See the testimony of A.H., Clifford Stone, et al. SG] The Wright Patterson Air Force Base was brought up on a num ber of occasions. Apparently there were m ore lock-ons at Wright Patterson th an at any other Air Force Base. Edwards Air Force Base was m entioned as an experim ental stati on. When I say m entioned, in that context I mean Edwards was involved in testing whatever ET materials they found. It was said that that was what was being done. Radar lock-ons had com e from Edwards Air Force Base [ too] . [See the testimony of Chuck Sorrells regar ding the 1965 multiple UFO radar lock-on at Edwards. SG] I should note that I was there in the Pentagon at the sam e tim e that Colonel Philip Corso was there. I did not have any m ore contact with the subject m atter of UFO’s until after I cam e in contact with the President [ Eisenhower] . I ha d heard that he did an awful lot of doodling on paper, on notebook paper, particularly at conferences that he wasn’ t particularly happy with. He would take to doodling and one of the things th at he did was doodle various form s of UFOs. I never saw Kennedy do this but President Eise nhower did it, and he did it in m y presence as well as several other people who were attached to the White House Arm y Signaling Agency where I was assigned. When I first cam e to wo rk for the President I didn’ t meet him until probably a month and a half after I had been on board. At that tim e it was a very form al m eeting. Right after that I got an opportunity to travel a little bit with the President. We did som e traveling towards Florida. And I had an opportunity to see him under fire, as it were, and how he handled certain people that he didn’t like and when he did that he would doodle. He was probably one of the world’s best doodlers and every body would kid him about it. I wouldn’t, but I wasn’t in a position to do so but the higher officers would kind of say little things every now and then. He would just sm ile and keep on doodling. Well, on som e of those occasions he had just been given messages or had been given inform ation pertaining to sightings or inform ation about UFO’ s and I know that for a fact because I was in the COM Center and I saw that inform ation. When he would get these reports it would excite him . He was just a kid. He would get so excited and give orders like D-day was happening all over again. He was very , very inte rested in the shapes and sizes of the UFOs and what m ade them go. The White House itself has a huge COM Center in the basem ent. It is run by the Air Force but the Arm y is there. Every place where the President would go including Cam p David has a COM Center that deals specifically with presiden tial traffic. The inform ation would be convey ed usually by a Warrant Officer. Our Chief Warrant Officer had been in the Arm y for probably 30 years or more. When he would get that kind of inform ation [ about UFOs] he som etim es would close him self off and he would be alone for a while and then he would call in whom ever he needed to call in. But dealing specifically with UFOs, I can only rem ember on one or two occasions where that inform ation cam e directly from the COM Center to him . Most of the tim e it seem ed to com e indirectly to the President. Most of that m aterial when it is passed through, it is “for ey es only ,” and that means that if you have a direct interest in it then y ou will see it. If y ou don’ t then y ou won’ t. You knew that there were sightings of UFOs. You knew that there were new findings. If y ou had been around 172"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":" the President long enough y ou could just judge by his expressions what he was reading and what interested him . It was just som ething that y ou knew from being around him . SG: He showed particular interest in this subject? SL: Very , very m uch interest. In fact, I would say that this subject was probably am ong his highest of interests at that tim e. Yes indeed. Reports about these UFOs were not terribly rare . It happened quite frequently . I wouldn’ t dare say how m any tim es but it happened frequently . What happened was not one particular agency could handle dealing with the entire subject matter, dealing with the engineering portion, to sighting inform ation, to reporting it into Bluebook. The whole process of dealing with the UFO phenom enon could not be handled any more by one agency and so in order to keep it alive it was given to various parts of the governm ent to work on. And I guess that they thought that they could also keep the intelligence factor as secret as possible by giving agencies a little bit here and a little bit there. And that type of com partm entalization oftentim es is done with m atters like this. But what happened was that Eisenhower got sold out. Without him knowing it he lost control of what was going on with the entire UFO situation. In his last address to the nation I think he was telling us that the Military Industrial Com plex would stick y ou in the back if y ou were not totally vigilant. And I think that he felt like he had not been vigilant. I think he felt like he trusted too m any people. And Eisenhower was a trusting m an. He was a good m an. And I think that he realized that all of a sudden this matter is going into the control of corporations that could very well act to the detrim ent of this country . This frustration, from what I can rem ember, went on for m onths. He realized that he was losing control of the UFO subject. He realized that the phenom enon or whatever it was that we were faced with was not going to be in the best hands. As far as I can rem ember, that was the expression that was used, “It is not going to be in the best hands”. That was a real concern. And so it has turned out to be. It had been discussed with m e on num erous occasions what could happen to me militarily if I discussed this. I would say that the governm ent has done as good a job enforcing secrecy through the installation of abject fear as they have done w ith any thing within the m emory of m odern m an. I really believe they have done a job. One older officer discussed with me what possibly could happen if there was a revelation. He was talk ing about being erased and I said, “Man, what do you m ean erased?” And he said, “Yes, y ou will be erased-disappear.” And I said, “How do y ou know all this?” And he said, “I know. Those th reats have been made and carried out. Those threats started way back in 1947. The Arm y Ai r Force was given absolute control over how to handle this. This being the biggest security situa tion that this country has ever dealt with and there have been som e erasures.” I know he was very convincing when he said th is and he was in a position to know. He was much older than I and he had been involved with the CIA. He knew what he was talking about. He wasn’ t kidding. So I guess fear has done it. I don’ t care what kind of a person y ou are. I don’ t care how strong or courageous y ou are. It would be a very fearful situation because from what Matt [ this older officer] said, “They will go after not only you. They will go after your fam ily .” Those were his words. And so I can onl y say that the reason that they have m anaged to 173"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":" keep it under wraps for so long is through fear. They are very selective about how they pull som eone out to m ake an exam ple of. And I know that that has been done. In this country during the early 1950s, num erous bases were built that would allow the President and Congress and VIPs to go in case of att ack. That is to m aintain the governm ent to function and so forth. Mt. Weather, Virginia was one of those. Ft. Ritchie, Mary land was another. Cam p David, Mary land was another. Th ere was another one in West Virginia at that tim e which we only knew as Concrete. That was th e code nam e. Mt. Weather, for exam ple, is underground. It is designed specifically to be im penetrable, as far as we knew, from atom ic weaponry . When I first went on tour there, I was told about special equipm ent that they had. We had to go through all of these places where the President would go just to fam iliarize ourselves on what to do and how to do it. And there was equi pm ent up there to deal specifically with the UFO problem . There was a standard operating instruction on what to do. UFOs had been sighted around Mt. Weather not only on one or two occasions but on num erous occasions from what I understand. They also have been sighted in W est Virginia at the place that I referred to as Concrete. We have gotten so much m omentum with the secrecy that has shrouded this subject m atter that we are liable to wind up in a big, fat crash. And granted I am not privy to the things that I would like to be privy to but as I see it when y ou pr opagate a lie and propagate a fear of the truth, you put y ourself in a very vulnerable position. They have been keeping this secret for a long tim e so evidently they have known how to do it. But at som e point in tim e, because of the inter est I think that the m edia has taken, there will be people com ing out speaking that have never thought about speaking before, particularly about Nellis and what has been going on there. And y ou can’t create any thing positive through fear. Fear only degenerates the hum an soul and the hum an psy che, the hum an m ind if y ou will. I think secrecy has been enforced because what would be revealed would totally destroy an econom y that was designed by certain capitalists in this country a long, long tim e ago to m aintain them and their corporations from here to eternity . I think oil has a special interest in seeing that it maintains its position where it is, regardless of what kind of pollution or disastrous side effects may have occurred and continue to occur. I think that what we are dealing with is cer tain electrom agnetic devices that are powered by sources that we just don’ t quite understand as of yet - well, we are certainly not advertising them any way. But these devices would generate free pow er. And free power would be som ething that corporations panic about. I think this gove rnm ent panics about it. Looking at it from a governm ental point of view: How are y ou going to tax free power? And from every one that I have talked to who knows som ething about this s ubject m atter, they do believe that the sources of energy that keep these vehicles in propulsion are sources of energy that are just as free as free could be. They don’t cause any harm to the envir onm ent. They don’t cause any footprints to be left any where... Given the fact that we are having a real question about how to deal with the high price of Arab oil right now, Bush as you know, is try ing to insist that we go into som e of the arctic regions and take m ore oil out. I for one don’ t see that as an answer. With the global warm ing situation being what it is, that would just be anot her nail in our coffin. But at som e point in tim e we are going to have to share this inform ation that would allow us to have free energy . The governm ent knows about this. It is foolish for th em to try to m ake the rest of us look like im beciles and say that this can’t happen. Well, it can happen. 174"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":" ... The question was, \"Did I hear that we had ever picked up signals which could not be identified or, if they could be identified, were they com ing in from strange craft that perhaps had put us under surveillance?” Yes I did hear that. I heard that from at least five or six reports that wound up in Bluebook. In fact, several of the re ports had com e in through pilots’ radios. So whatever intelligence we were dealing with at th at tim e knew how to deal with us. They knew how to com municate with us and we knew they were of extraterrestrial origin. [See also the testimony of John Maynard and others.] Testim ony of Merle Shane McDow, US Navy Atlantic Com mand October 2000 Mr. McDow entered the Navy in 1978 and gained a top-secret, Special Com partm ented Intelligence (SCI) clearance with a Zebra Stri pes. He was assigned to the Atlantic Operational Support Facility , Atlantic Com mand, then under Adm iral Trane. Mr. McDow was present when a UFO was tracked by radar and seen by pilots visually moving at high speed up and down the Atlantic coast. The Com mand Center was put on Zebra alert and Adm iral Trane gave the order to force down the UFO. Mr. McDow discusses the threats, intim idation and confiscation of logbooks that occurred after the event. MM: Merle McDow SG: Dr. Steven Greer MM: I enlisted in the United States Navy in August of 1978, and was assigned to the USS Am erica, where unfortunately I sustained som e injuries on the flight deck while perform ing m y duties. I then went to CINC-ANT Fleet, Atla ntic Com mand Support Facility in Norfolk, Virginia on Ham pton Boulevard. I was directly assigned to AOSF, Division 22; we were a group of about eleven people then. We were directly res ponsible for briefing Adm iral Trane who was the Com mander in Chief, Atlantic Com mand. We briefed him on current m ilitary operations around the world, what the Soviets were doing that day , what they had done the night before, etc. AOSF is just an acrony m for Atlantic Operational Support Facility and CINC-ANT Fleet is another acrony m for Com mander in Chief-Atlantic Fleet, which Adm iral Trane was at the tim e. Every one on the eastern seaboard answered to this m an. After a six m onth wait I got a top-secret, Special Com partm ented Intelligence (SCI) clearance, with a zebra stripe identification badge, which perm itted access to all facilities on the base at all tim es. I had unrestricted access to any facility at any tim e as well as the Com mand Center to which it was specifically assigned. My station was up on the m ezzanine, or the third deck as we called it, over the Com mand Center. My job was to make sure that any incom ing and outgoing audio/video inform ation that cam e into the Com mand Center was recorded and duly logged for reference in case they needed it later. I recorded all of the video and audio - every thing that is going on- even when they calle d a Condition Zebra alert. This was generally a training exercise that they would announce beforehand by say ing, “This is a drill. This is a drill. Set Condition Zebra.” and unauthorized personnel would then be escorted out of the Com mand Center if they didn’t already know that they had to leave. Condition Zebra is the highest level of alert that the Navy has – or had at that tim e – for generally dealing with global nuclear threats, in particular the Soviets. Soviet Bearcats were routinely patrolling up and down the eastern seaboa rd watching what we were doing. And we 175"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":" would set a Condition Zebra if we had the need to put planes in the air to escort the bearcats out of the area if they were a little too close to our airspace or if they had ships in the area that were suspicious acting, for instance. Or we would ha ve a drill, for instance, when they would get out the MAD books to wage nuclear war. The Watch Officer and the Junior Watch Officer, the JOD, had key s to a safe and they would get these books out called the MAD books – Mutual Assured Destruction – and they would have the codes that were necessary to transm it to the subm arines if necessary , to launch a nuclear strike. And not m any people were allowed in the Com mand Center when that was going on because they actually did u se the codes and so forth. I am sure the Soviets and any others person who were enem ies of the United States would like to get their hands on that inform ation. The Zebra Classifica tion - well, without that y ou were not allowed authorized access to these facilities during this dr ill and the Zebra Drill was specifically for the highest level of top-secret inform ation that was being exchanged between the Com mand Center and ships and/or subm arines at sea. Well, about this incident: The day started out pr etty routine. I would say this was around the first week or two in May [1981] to the best of m y knowledge. So every thing was going along pretty routinely when they dim med the lights (t hey did this first in the Com mand Center when they set a Condition Zebra alert). Most of th e tim e when they set these drills they would say , “This is a drill. This is a drill. Set Condition Zebra.” But they turned the lights down this tim e and they didn’t say , “This is a drill.” And the Wa tch Officer and the Juni or Watch Officer looked at each other and told som e of their assistants to verify whether or not this was a drill as the event was taking place. And the early warning sy stem - I believe it cam e in from an Air Force base in Greenland or Nova Scotia at that tim e- said that we had contact with an unidentified fly ing object that had entered our air space. And they said that this was not a drill and so it was treated with the utm ost prom ptness and every one started running around like mad once they realized that it wasn’t a drill. It took on a whole different air. Within m oments of that, the Watch Officer sum moned Adm iral Trane over to the Com mand Center because this was a little out of his area of authorization for lack of a better way to put it. It required Adm iral Trane’s oversight. And within minutes Adm iral Trane was rushed into the Com mand Center into his viewing booth that he had right under the Mezzanine there and the first thing that Adm iral Trane wanted to know was how m any contacts we had, where they were, which direction were they going, and were th e Soviets responding. Because we knew that it wasn’ t the Soviets that had entered our airspace. That was verified from the get go, from the start. At that point, when Adm iral Trane found out that it wasn’t the Soviets and that he wanted to know were the Soviets responding to this threat also, that was the m oment that he gave authorization to put two planes up to go see what th is thing was. And that was when the chasing up and down the eastern seaboard began. We launched planes from as far north as Greenland to NAS (Naval Air Station) Oceania. This object, we had it on radar- this event lasted alm ost an hour. You could hear the pilots live voice transm issions being piped into the Com mand Center. And they had visual confirm ation of the object and m ade descriptions of the object. Pilots were able to close a couple of tim es and were able to see that the object was not an aircraft that we were fam iliar with- it was nothing that we had and nothing that the Soviets had. That was determ ined very quickly . This vehicle or what ever it was that they were chasing showed very erratic flight up and down the coast, quick flight. It would actually be off the coast of Maine, fo r instance, and would leave the airspace in that area so quickly that we were having to have pl anes com ing out of Dover Air Force base just to pick it up just in what seem ed like m oments. Well, I know for a fact that it would take an F-14 176"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":" probably thirty m inutes to traverse that much dist ance but this object, whatever it was, was just popping up. One minute it was here and the next m inute bam , it was down several hundred m iles down the coast, just play ing tag. [See the accounts of Dr. Paul Czysz, Comm ander Bethune, and many others regarding this type of non-linear and extraordinary propulsion. SG] It did go all the way down to a point off the coast of Florida around May port, the Naval Air station that we have down there at Cecil Field. And that was before it turned and took what would have been an easterly direction from our vantage point back up towards the Azores before we actually lost track of it. During all this, we were using satellites called the KH-11 satellites that we use for inform ation gathering. And this satellite did have a very high capability of taking really good photographs of things literally within a few feet of the ground from a vantage point out in outer space. And they were try ing to get the KH-11 sate llite to track this thing to get som e photographs of it. The photographs that we did get back in the Com mand Center later on cam e from the first encounters that the planes had with it off of th e northern North Am erican coast. They did get close enough to get som e photographs taken that we re later brought over to the Com mand Center. Well, from the photograph I rem ember the shape was m ore like a cy linder; it was quite flat and long. It had abrupt ends. The ends didn’t ta per down like m ost aircraft. It just cam e to an abrupt end and it did appear to be reflecting sunlight and you could clearly tell that it was metallic. And the pilots were giving inform ation such as it was not leaving behind a vapor trail, no discernable lights or m arkings on it, no cockpit windows or doors, nothing like that. It just seem ed to be one solid thing whatever it was. What was really bugging Adm iral Trane, what was really driving him nuts, was this thing absolutely had com plete control of the situation a nd could be any where that it wanted to be in a matter of seconds. One m inute we were closing on it off the coast of Maine and the next m inute it is in Norfolk heading south towards Florida. And it is all that we can do to get the early warning radar up and down the coast to watch for this thing as it just had it’s day with us. Adm iral Trane and his staff were quite concerne d about it to say the least. They were quite concerned especially once they found out that it wasn’t the Russians and it wasn’t us and he wasn’t aware of any one else who had the technology to build such a craft that could move about so easily and so quickly . I rem ember distinctly looking over the rail of the m ezzanine and just watching com plete chaos break out because of th eir inability to keep an ey e on this thing, whatever it was. The UFO was m oving around so erratically and so quickly up and down the coast... They were try ing to notify as m any com mands as they could up and down the coast to track this thing or get a plane up. Adm iral Trane was scram bling and authorizing planes just left and right up and down the whole eastern seaboard to try and cut this thing off and to get som e planes from the north and south to literally track it and to force it dow n. It was clear that they wanted to recover it, to force it down by whatever m eans possible. The order was given by Adm iral Trane to try and get this object forced down out of the sky if at all possible, by whatever means possible. After they found out and knew for certainty that it wasn’t the Russians, they didn’t care who it was as long as it wasn’t the Russians. They didn’t care who it was or where it was from . They wanted it and they wanted it bad. 177"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":" The inform ation com ing in from the Com mand Cent er was being relay ed to us from different radar sites that we have up and down the eastern coast that watch our airspace. I would describe the officers as being scared. Yeah , they were scared to put it in a nutshell. Adm iral Trane was usually a very calm m an of very m ild dem eanor a really nice fellow. And you never really saw him lose control or raise hi s voice or get excited about any thing. But this really got him upset to say the least. I would say that was the im pression that I had from most of the officers there - they were just as m uch in the dark and scared as every body else. They would actually not track it down the coast. It would just appear hundreds of miles from the last sighting. And the pilots said that one m oment it was there and the next m oment it wasn’ t. And I think that that was one of the things that really had Adm iral Trane’ s hackles up because he didn’t have any control of it or the situation. This thing just had a m ind of its own and was causing such an uproar up and down the eastern coast . Adm iral Trane was ultim ately responsible at that tim e and I am sure it was stressing him out quite a great deal. You could tell by his tone of voice. You could just tell by listening to hi m that he was very , very , very worried. But on radar we were keeping track of it one minute and then we would absolutely lose it, and then we would pick it up. It would just appear as an unauthorized vehicle in military airspace. And trust m e, the m ilitary knows where every com mercial flight is at all tim es. We knew where every plane we had was at all tim es. We knew where every com mercial flight com ing through our airspace was at all tim es. There just wasn’ t any thing going on that we didn’ t know about it. All the planes that were scram bled were put up off of the shore facilities- the Navy has shore facilities, the Naval Air station for exam ple, Oceania. When you set a Condition Zebra, whether it is a drill or not people are not authorized to be there who do not have a Zebra Access Badge. It is a zebra striped area on your clearance badge. They have to leave the Com mand facility and we have Marines stationed inside and outside the building there that were under orders to shoot any unauthorized personnel that rem ained in the Com mand Center during one of these episodes. That was for the interest of national security . For exam ple, one tim e a Condition Zebra was called and the Marine com es in and wants to know what is going on. Is this a drill or so forth? They have got orders to start shooting people. And I know because I actually got the Junior OOD’ s attention and said, “Hey , y ou guy s need to tell this guy som ething. He is ready to start shooting people.” They haven’t told him to stand down yet, which he did. And I rem ember wanti ng to just get the hell out of there because he cam e in there and he said, “You have got a m inute or two. If I don’t find out som ething”– he was ready to com e in there and start shooting people, destroy ing evidence. When this event, as I refer to it, ended, th e object that we had been chasing up and down the seaboard headed out over the Atlantic, over the Azores. I do rem ember them say ing that it had pulled up at a 66 degree angle as it approached the Azores like this, and it just pulled up at a 66 degree angle without slowing down or any thing and left the atm osphere and was gone into space. It just took off into space and was gone like that (sna ps fingers). I m ean it just absolutely left. You are talking about som ething that covered thou sands of m iles in a blink of an ey e and it was just gone and it just left every one sitting around scratching their heads. “Gee whiz, I wonder what that was.” It was com ical in a way to see how the vast m ilitary m ight of the United States was put on its knees by som ething they had no idea what it w as, where it cam e from , where it was going or 178"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":" any thing. The only thing that they knew for sure was that it wasn’ t the Soviets and they were very adam ant about finding that out. So we secured from Condition Zebra. They turned the lights up. Every one was sitting around talking about it down on the com mand floor. I am up here by m yself on the third deck. Adm iral Trane is down here in his briefing area. They stay ed for a few m inutes before they left. I m ade a note of it in m y logbook like y ou had to do. Then I really didn’t give it much more thought. Later, these two guy s cam e in, in suits. They we ren’ t in military uniform . They just cam e in, in suits and they had their little badges on but they didn’t have Zebra Striped badges. It was like a visitor badge. You could tell that they weren’ t regular personnel. And I didn’t know them from Tom , Dick, or Harry . I had never seen these guy s before. So we go downstairs to the first floor and there were several little conference room s and they took m e into one that they already set up and sat m e down- and they had m y logbook. They got that and took it down with m e. These two gentlem en began to question m e about this event. They were being pretty rough about it to be honest with y ou. I rem ember literally putting m y hands up and say ing, “Wait a minute fellows. I’m on y our side. Just a m inute,” because they were not really nice. They were very intim idating and m ade it quite clear to the point that nothing that was seen, heard, or witnessed, that transpired was to l eave this building. “You are not to say a word about it to y our co-workers. And off base, y ou just forget every thing that y ou m ay have seen or heard concerning this. It didn’ t happen.” They were nasty , I guess is a good way to put it. I distinctly rem ember sitting back in my chair and I put my hands up and had to tell these guy s, “Wait a m inute, we are on the sam e side fellows. We don’ t have a problem here.” You got the im pression that they would do bodily harm to y ou otherwise, without really com ing out and threatening y ou. You could just tell by their tone of voice when som eone is say ing, “Hey buddy , do what I say or else.” If this object had been hostile and wanted to drop weapons or shoot m issiles at us, or whatever, it would have been very easy for them to do that. There was no question about that. We didn’t have any thing at that tim e that could hold a candle to whatever this was. And it just had its own free run of our airspace and could do any thing it wanted as far as traveling. We did not pose any threat to it whatsoever. That was painfully obvious, very m uch so. I do believe that Adm iral Trane knew that too and was quite afraid. Just in a word I would say that that old boy was just plain scared. SG: Whatever happened to the photographs of the UFO? MM: That is a really good point that y ou raised about what happened to the 35 m m slides that we had. That is a really good point th at y ou have there because we never got around to putting them up on the Telesign [ sp] for Adm iral Trane to actually view. They were just prepared. I can rem ember her [the technician dealing with the slides] telling m e that these two men in suits cam e in, got up all the film devel oped and undeveloped and all the m aterials that they had with it and the slides. My logbook, I neve r did see that again. I know that we had a new logbook the next day - a brand spanking new one to start with. I don’t know what happened to it and nobody really knew what happened to it. This technician also said, “These two guy s cam e in here and read us the riot act and wanted this, that and the other and rounded up all th eir stuff and they weren’t real nice.” 179"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":" This event went down as just an unidentified flying object. They never did know what it was. I rem ember the Watch Officer and the JOD and the OOD, Officer of the Deck and Junior Officer of the Deck, I do rem ember them looking at each other talking. And I am just hanging m y head over listening and they are talking to each other a bout how to put it in their logbook. They just said, “Put it down as an unidentified fly ing object contact and that is it.” I would say that the facilities that actually had this UFO on radar- there were five that I am sure of, and that is from Greenland all the way to Florida, and there m ay be som e others that I don’ t know. I know this because Adm iral Trane was giving orders to NAS Oceania, “Let’ s get som e planes up from there, scram ble som e fighters.” He did m ake a call for them to alert Dover Air Force Base, Patuxent River, Mary land, Cecil Field down in Florida... When I got out, I received an official United States Navy docum ent on the Navy letterhead. They gave m e this docum ent where for five y ears it was absolutely out of the question for m e to leave the country under any circum stances whatsoever. And to leave the state of Virginia I had to contact the Roanoke office of the FBI and let them know if I just wanted to cross the state line to go into North Carolina. And that was for five y ears after I was discharged. I also wanted to tell y ou about this m ember of m y wife’ s fam ily . Jack Booth is his nam e. He is dead now but he was in the arm y and he was stationed at Roswell when the Roswell incident happened. He was m y wife’s uncle- m y wife’s m other’s brother. He was from Bluefield, West Virginia. He said that when he was just a kid in the arm y, he was at Roswell (NM) when this thing, whatever it was, crashed. And he was th ere pulling guard duty when they went out to the crash site. A truckload of them went to pick debris up and whatnot, and he was there when they actually did recover the bodies. He said, “I am telling y ou that they put little bitty guy s in body bags and they weren’t hum ans. They were just little odd-looking fellows. They were nothing like a hum an.” And they put them in body bags and one or two of them were still conscious or alive or som ething like that from the crash. There were actual survivors from this crash according to him . They were picking up all the little pieces of the craft and he said that they actually put those guy s down shoulder to shoulder on their hands and knees and went across the debris area picking up any little speck and scrap that they had. And they did it for day s. He said that they were all threatened. He said they just cam e right out and said, “Look, if y ou say any thing about this you might just turn up m issing tom orrow.” [See the testimony of Glen Dennis, John Weygandt, Brigadier General Lovekin, et al regarding such threats. SG] He did say that. They didn’t m ake any bones about it and cam e right to the point about letting them know how m uch they wanted to keep this under wraps. He said, “I’m telling y ou – I was there.” Another man I m et who knew about this subj ect was John Michael Murphy . He was a Marine Corp Corporal when I was in the Navy . He was stationed down there at the security barracks at CINC-ANT Fleet. He was part of the security detail there for the base. Murphy swore up and down that when he was still in the Marine Corp that he had actually guarded a spaceship, an extraterrestrial craft at a fac ility not far from Dover Air Force Base over in Delaware. Knowing Murphy as I did, I would believe him . I woul d believe Murphy . This would have been 1979 m aybe, 1980. 180"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":" [This testimony is of great significance because the witness had such a high security clearance top secret SCI with Zebra stripes and was personally involved in a prolonged encounter with an extraterrestrial vehicle for over one hour that was on at least five radar scopes, visually contacted by pilots, etc. It underscores the need for a general disclosure on the subject since the dangers to world peace and security resulting from our forces chasing and attempting to down such advanced craft are obvious. In briefings that I have done for senior CIA and Pentagon officials, often we find these men a re not at all adequately informed about the subject and might react in a similarly dangerous fashion shown here by Admiral Trane’s orders to down the object. In the vacuum of secrecy, terrible mistakes can be made due to a lack of knowledge and perspective. For this reason we continue to call for an ending of secrecy on this subject so that our military and national secur ity leaders can be adequately informed and so diplomats and other leaders in society can form ulate an appropriate, safe, and peaceful response to the extraterrestrial civilizations which are already observing our world. The stakes are too high to allow this matter to be the domain of only covert projects or unprepared military leaders. The danger here is not from the extraterrestrial veh icles per se but from a lack of knowledge and preparation in how to properly deal with their presence. SG] Testimony of Lieutenant Colonel Charles Brown (retired), US Air Force October 2000 After returning from WW II an Air Force he ro, Col Brown worked in the Air Force Office of Special Investigations. He was assigned to work on Project Grudge where he was responsible for investigating UFO’ s and cam e to recognize that on som e cases there were no viable conventional explanati ons. He later cam e to believe that Bluebook was a deliberate whitewash to the public. Am ong others he was privy to reports of cases where four independent radars were tracki ng objects that were traveling 5000 m iles an hour. CB: Lt. Col. Charles Brown SG: Dr. Steven Greer CB: I’m a retired Lieutenant Colonel in the Un ited States Air Force. I spent approxim ately 23 y ears in m ilitary service, and the latter seven y ears as a Senior Foreign Service Officer. In my career I spent about 15 y ears abroad. I started out as an enlisted m an in the arm y in the West Virginia National Guard in the fall of 1939 [ and] en listed in the regular U.S. Arm y in the Signal Corp. in June of 1940 upon graduation from high school . I started training as a pilot in July of 1942 and was com missioned as a Second Lieutenant pilot in April of ‘43, then trained as a B-17 pilot aircraft Com mander. I went to Europe and arrived there in early Novem ber of 1943 and com menced com bat as a B-17 pilot on 13, Decem ber, 1943. I flew m y 29 th and last com plete m ission on the 11 th of April, 1944. Com bat during this period was fairly severe. I just com pleted a survey of my 31 attem pts at missions. And every tim e we went into the air, we had 235 casualties during those 31 missions. And I was very fortunate to com plete it... [I was] given a regular Air Force com mission in early 1950. I left active duty in the fall of ‘65 and gave up my prom otion to Colonel to accept em ploy ment as a Senior Foreign Services Officer. I then served seven y ears with the Agency for International Developm ent. Six of those seven y ears were spent in Southeast Asia as a regional inspector for the Agency . Basically , because of m y counter-intelligence training and police work in an outfit called Air Force Office of Special Investigations, and because I was one of the few pilot trained 181"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":" investigators, I ended up doing a lot of investiga tions of aircraft, unusual aircraft accidents in which sabotage was suspected. And as a conse quence becam e acquainted with som e outstanding scientists and worked with the Air Technical In telligence Center on a project called Grudge. At that tim e Office of Special Investigations was a worldwide investigative unit in the Air Force. We were given the responsibility of investig ating what becam e known as unidentified fly ing objects. The title within the center was Project Grudge. My job was in District D-05 of Wright Patterson Air Force Base where we received these worldwide reports. My job was to hand carry these reports over to the technical center and coordinate them with the project officer a nd answer any questions from an investigative viewpoint that I could assist on. I did that for approxim ately two y ears until the fall of 1951. When I left Wright Patterson, Colonel Dunn w as nice enough to give m e a two-page letter of appreciation for m y work with Project Grudge. A nd so far as I know, that is certainly one of the early form al recognition’s of work of an Air Fo rce officer with Project Grudge. Now, the behind the scenes efforts that could have been going on sim ultaneously , fortunately , I was not privileged to but I did gain a feeling [ of what was going on] in that m any of the investigations were never answered. Norm ally , in the investigative field, you have an allegation of som ething or in the case of a UFO, a sighting let’s say . You carry it through to its conclusion and a result. And, in many of those instances, although it’ s been a long tim e ago, I do know that there were no viable scientific results [reported] . And as a consequence, it developed m y interest into the unidentified fly ing objects. Having spent several hundred hours in the air at that point, I followed it throughout the rest of m y Air Force career. And in Strategic Air Com mand, I was a coordinating officer between the Deputy for Intelligence and C ontinental Arm y Com mand, which at that tim e, had responsibility for the m issile defense of the United States. When an object is m oving a few thousand m iles an hour, 12-14 m inutes is a trem endous am ount of tim e. I do rem ember speeds in excess of four to five thousand m iles an hour, which were far in excess of any known aircraft that we had or any of the enem ies. And being an Intelligence Officer one of m y responsibilities was to have at least a rough idea of enem y capabilities and of their equipm ent. Once, we flew into Nellis Air Force Base and another pilot and I were fly ing a Gooney Bird [C-47A Sky train] . The sky was totally clear. And an object went across southwest to northeast and it transited the entire heaven, looking at it from m y right, and it went out of sight on the left, in probably less than 15 seconds. It was m oving at a speed that I couldn’ t even begin to calculate. It was certainly no satellite. It was a controlled object in flight. Som e of the objects reported were tracked on radar. We had objects with f our-way confirm ation, ground visual, ground radar, airborne visual, airborne radar. And so far as I’ m concerned, it doesn’ t get any better than that! [Here we have a senior military and foreign servi ce official, a hero of our country, confirming the excellent nature of the radar evide nce and the reality of these UFOs while in Air Force Project Grudge. This starkly contradicts the official Air Force and government claims that no adequate evidence exists to confirm the reality of UFOs and therefore there is nothing to study. SG] You are not talking about som eone’s im aginati on. And in this sam e tim efram e, I heard so- called experts that the Air Force brought in and concoct stories from swam p gas to things like that. If it’s an aircraft with wings and then the laws of air dy nam ics apply , you don’t stop that thing and reverse it in a blink of an ey e. And things like that did occur. 182"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":" It is sort of strange but we send people to prison, we send people to their death because of eyewitness accounts of crim es. Our legal sy stem is based on that to a large degree. Yet in my following of unusual aerial phenom ena for the past 50 y ears, there seem s to be som e reason to discredit very viable and very reputable witnesses wh en they say som ething is unidentified. Well, you show m e the individual that can identify ever ything in the heavens, and I will show y ou the Second Com ing. Just, that sim ple! Because I don’ t care how technically qualified y ou are -- for som eone who is not there to voice an opinion and say oh, they saw such and such [is nonsense] . And m y question is where did they get off, what was the stop that dropped them that qualified them to be experts? And I have a real problem with that. I truly believe that these phenom ena have been visiting this planet long before Project Grudge. I think there is adequate evidence of it. And the m ore we learn about the planet, the more we learn how little we truly know. And so the advance of science is som ething that has to keep evolving and we have to keep learning. ... CB: I do not rem ember m uch of that. And I would do very little in term s of looking at Gun Cam era film , for exam ple. Photographs I tried to, to do rather well on. SG: Had y ou heard that Gun Cam era footage of UFOs exists? CB: I had every reason to believe they existed. But I also had reason to believe that the Gun Cam era film was handled very caref ully , not for general observations. [Note that Colonel Brown repeats what Commander Graham Bethune and others have observed: that the compartmented nature of proj ects dealing with the UFO subject creates a situation where someone like Colonel Brown, working inside Project Grudge would not have access to other evidence, projects and information. SG] ... CB: President Trum an, who was a rather direct individual [knew about these objects] over White House airspace. I’ ve seen radar photographs of organized lights of unidentified objects, balls of light, if y ou will [ over the White H ouse] . These are on radar, ground, visual ground radar, airborne visual, airborne radar. Now the airborne visual, strangely enough, by the tim e y ou get a couple of fighters down there, those things appa rently disappeared whenever they wanted to. [He is referring here to the multiple enc ounters of UFOs over the White House and surrounding areas in July of 1952. SG] So President Trum an gets involved. He sees a ll of the newspaper headlines and things. He say s I want the m an who is responsible for inv estigating these things. So, I think General John Sanford was an Air Force Assistant Chief of Staff Intelligence. Som eone said, well, General Sanford is the Chief of Air Force Intelligence. So President Trum an said, is he the guy that’s responsible for it? Well, they said, well y es, si r, overall, but... Trum an said, is he handling the investigation? They said, no sir. That would be a man out at Wright Patterson AFB. Trum an said, then that’s the man I want to brief m e. So I do know that they flew into Washington. And I have every reason to believe that he briefed the President. Later when I was in Britain, they were havi ng a NATO exercise out in the North Sea area. And a couple of these little friendly balls of light got in the traffic pattern. Well, y ou can im agine what happened when they flew over the deck w ithout landing, needless to say . And it threw the Navy into absolute consternation, as y ou can im agine. Well, the newspapers picked it up and they were in those day s able to talk to the sa ilors and the airm en involved. And every one is scream ing for an investigation. They [the Britis h] said, we have no investigative agency , blah, 183"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":" blah. Well, to make a long story short, som e years later, the group Captain I worked for, who retired as an Air Vice Marshall... we were talking a bout this incident. And he said that the U.K. agency investigating UFO’s was one floor above me in the sam e building that I worked in for three and one-half y ears, and y et they did not adm it its existence! [This testimony is corroborated by British Foreign Service Official Gordon Creighton who, while not knowing Colonel Brown, tells an almost identical account of a covert UK office dealing with the matter. SG] Well, this is just the tip of the iceberg, becau se som e of the very unusual sightings were in the U.K. [See the testimony of Nick Pope, Larry Warren, et al. SG] And they were also talking about the little Foo Fighters that were over Germ any . The Germ ans thought they were ours and we thought they were Germ ans. Now in the real world, balls of light do not have a place being guided by an Intelligence, being airborne, and causing consternation or play ing gam es. There is no explanation other than they are from som eplace else. So as far as I’ m concerned, that is totally inexplicable, based on m y judgm ent, m y background, and m y research. I do know that there are agencies of our Governm ent that can m anipulate data. And y ou can create or recreate [whatever y ou want] . Craft, in telligently operated craft, have basically violated our laws of phy sics on this planet. And they have done that for a long tim e. The fact that the Governm ent at this point -- I know we have been investigating since 1947 -- has not com e up with an answer, to m e indicates that there is something seriously wrong. Are we this incom petent in science? I don’t think so. Are we this inco mpetent in intelligence? I know we are not this incom petent in intelligence. Now, Project Bl ue Book, when it was closed by Dr. Condon’s group, I have every reason to believe that this was a total deliberate whitewash. [This is confirmed by Government documents and the testimony of Dr. Robert Woods and others. SG] And m y judgm ent is that there is an excelle nt chance that elem ents of the United States Governm ent, for reasons unknown, have failed to advise the public of every thing that has transpired. UFO’ s have been investigated for an extended period of tim e and the general public is not being m ade aware, fully aware – but are given only bits and pieces, program med responses and things like that. So it is strange that y ou should be interviewing m e prior to a national election [ October 2000] because all y ou have to do is turn on a television set or listen to a radio and y ou hear and see the results of professiona l program ming. We m ake blind men see and injured people walk and things like that. And we m ake people talk in a certain fashion and we give them intelligence. We can do a lot of things. We also hide a lot of things. SG: Please tell us about y our work with new energy research and how that has been suppressed. CB: I knew from engineering m anuals and from research done at MIT that if we went from totally dry air to totally saturated air, y ou should im prove the efficiency of an engine by about 2%. Well, by hum idify ing air [ through this process we discovered] -- at that tim e I thought it was all I was doing -- I was getting 20% to 30% im provem ent in the efficiency of an internal com bustion engine. Well, engineering people and sci entists just wouldn’t believe it. So I went ahead, not knowing any better, I started selling these devices which im proved engine 184"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":" perform ance so rem arkably . Well, som e strange things started to happen and Governm ent agencies m oved in, and particularly the Federal Trade Com mission. The EPA was satisfied that it worked. But there was no Governm ent support. Finally the adm inistrator of the EPA had asked the director of their research lab in North Carolin a if he would work with m e. So I showed up without knowing that he had called him with a diesel vehicle. Very spectacular results in that, so far as I know, it was the first diesel ever tested in a United States EPA laboratory that sim ultaneously reduced all aspects of m easured diesel em issions, plus im proved fuel econom y up to 23% . So far as I know, no one has every equaled it. The Federal Trade Com mission later perform ed, literally , an illegal act. The statem ent, precise statem ent m ade to the attorney for a large dealer in Washington was, we don’t care whether it works or not. We just don’ t want people buy ing these large Am erican cars. I could not, when I got that report, I couldn’t im agine an officer of the United States Governm ent -- this is 1979 - ‘80 -- say ing that. So I flew to Washington and went to the C ongress and saw a Senator with the Science and Technology com mittee, and m et the General Coun sel. He questioned m e at length. I had docum entation. He then said they would act. When I pointed out the unfairness of the FTC aspect, they wrote a scathing letter to the Chairm an of the Federal Trade Com mission and sent me a copy of it. Within three weeks from that date, I lost m y vehicle, about $100,000 worth of equipm ent, and a test vehicle was stolen. I had sponsored the U.S. Arm y race team on a little sprite racing car. They stole m y unit off of that car after we had just won the race. The Captain of the Arm y race team was a Master Sergeant in the Arm y. We’ d created a super car. And they stole that car from the U.S. Arm y in Van Nuy s, Ca lifornia. So in three weeks, psy chologically I was wiped out. This is no longer just talk. Ther e’s a real world out there. And as one who had engaged in, been in and around a com bat zone nine years of m y life, to have to com e back to this... It was quite traum atic. [Many researchers with devices that could rep lace fossil fuels or greatly reduce our dependence on them have been subject to this type of abuse and sabotage. It is unconscionable to me that a hero of our country like Colonel Brow n could be treated this way and no aspect of Government or law enforcement has helped him. Meanwhile, the Earth’s environment continues to be degraded. SG] We also had a project with the Maritim e Adm inistration, which was very successful. The conclusion was I could either add 20% in horsepower or 20% in fuel reduction, at the sam e tim e, sim ultaneous, with reducing em issions by 40% . [I have the results of these studies and they are remarkable. Imagine: 20 years ago we could have reduced emissions by 40% and increased fuel mileage by 20% , had suppression not occurred. SG] Near the end of the project, two m onths before, they said, our agreem ent is off. We are going to cancel the project. And I said, y ou can’t do this. [ They said] we’ve done it. So I said, well, I’m going to finish the project, and I paid for the last two m onths of it. They said, we are not going to distribute the test results. Not only that, they said, we want all of your notes and all of your records. I’m say ing, y ou really don’t have a right to those. And they say , y es we do. We paid for them . So, y ou don’t argue with the Gove rnm ent. So I m ade copies of every thing I had, several copies, distributed them at various points, and sent them the originals of all of this. What I did not know at the tim e, I put in a call to the chief engineer who had set up the project and he was never available. The num ber two engineer was never available. So I finally called the 185"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":" com ptroller. And he said, they are no longer with us. I said, what are y ou talking about? He said, they have elim inated the research division in the Maritim e adm inistration! So som eone did not want this concept to be successful. Then, later on a business trip, at two m inutes after m idnight, just into my birthday , a call com es into m y hotel room when I’ m just getting ready for bed. A voice say s, please get out of your room im mediately . I said, well if y ou tell me who y ou are and why , I’ll get out. Well, this is the desk clerk, and this poor m an’s voice was br eaking. He said, we just got a call there’s a bom b in y our room . I said, I don’t think I’ll discuss this any further. So, I hung up and went out. By this tim e they are evacuating the whole motel. And so I said, I’ ll check in to a Holiday Inn, which I did. I parked in a lighted area, right in front, this beat up old car I had with this device in it. I had several thousands of dollars of e quipm ent in it and was taking it over to Purdue University to do som e air tests. Any way, next m orning quarter of seven, I look out, there’ s a blank space where m y car was. They had stolen m y car. Police recovered it tw o or three weeks later, and found drilled holes in the gas tank and all of m y test equipm ent gone. I had built a prototy pe carburetor. That was the last tim e I ever did that. I had actually built the thing. And every thing was gone. And psy chologically again, it sort of zapped m e. So we have a call that there was a bom b in m y room . Som ebody was following m e. My phone was tapped. No question about this. And there was no logical reason for it. My unit was offered by this car dealer free with every new Am erican car, truck, or van purchased. I made that stipulation it had to be Am erican m ade. My concept really just opened a door on a whole new field of science. This is not just my judgm ent but that of at least three or four Ph.D.’ s, in phy sics, chem istry , and engineering. There are com bustion stim ulating m olecules and radicals generated in this process. It creates a thunderstorm in a bottle [ and creates molecules which greatly increase fuel efficiency and decreases em issions.] My concept can work as a retrofit item on older vehicles for people who want to keep them . But particularly on the polluting, m ajor polluting vehicles, which are 18 wheelers, diesel autom obiles, diesel buses in citi es, tow boats, and ocean going vessels. I think the potential is there for power generating plants , based on research done in Europe, in England, and by Max Planc in Germ any . I have every reason to believe it can be m ade to work on power generating plants. You would not even see white sm oke com ing out of one. I’ m 90% certain this can be m ade to happen with a m inim al investm ent. So any way, my concept adds oxy gen to the air am ong other things. Every thing it adds is an oxidant. It helps the planet. It even reduces CO 2 : when y ou use less fuel, CO 2 is reduced. So far as I know, it is probably the most fault free concept. And in essence I was advised by an agency of the United States Governm ent a few y ears ago, if I can do what I say I can do, it was a new field of science. Well, I’ve known it’s a new field of science since I can find no com petitive concepts. It is a m ethod of enriching the com bustion air, or charged air on any heat cy cle engine. I’ ve tested it on propane and done extensive m ulti- million mile testing on diesel and gasoline. I’ ve tested it on gasoline from 75 to 125 octane. I can run a vehicle that norm ally requires 92 octane on 75 octane without knoc k. And I have done so for a period of three m onths. In term s of the potential [ of this technology ], I’ve just scratched the surface. Had at the beginning, 25 y ears ago, the oil com panies gotten fully behind m e, it m ight extend the useful life of existing oil on this planet, which is a finite resource. 186"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":" 187"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":" Testimony of Dr. Carol Rosin Decem ber 2000 Dr. Carol Rosin was the first wom an corporate manager of Fairchild Industries and was spokesperson for Wernher Von Braun in the last y ears of his life.

Von Braun revealed to Dr. Rosin a plan to jus tify weapons in spaced based on hoaxing an extraterrestrial threat. She was also presen t at m eetings in the ‘70s when the scenario for the Gulf War of the ‘90s was planned. CR: Dr. Carol Rosin SG: Dr. Steven Greer CR: My nam e is Carol Rosin. I am an educator who becam e the first wom an corporate manager of an Aerospace Com pany , Fairchild I ndustries. I am a Space and Missile Defense Consultant and have consulte d to a num ber of com panies, organizations, and governm ent departm ents, even the intelligence com munity . I was a consultant to TRW working on the MX missile, so I was part of that strategy , which tu rned out to be a role m odel for how to sell space- based weapons to the public. The MX m issile is y et another weapon sy stem that we didn’ t need. I founded the Institute for Security and Coope ration in Outer Space, a Washington DC based think tank. I am an author and have testif ied before Congress and the President’ s Com mission on Space. When I was a Corporate Manager of Fairchild Industries from 1974 through 1977, I m et the late Dr. Wernher Von Braun. We first m et in ear ly 1974. At that tim e, Von Braun was dy ing of cancer but he assured m e that he would live a few m ore y ears to tell m e about the gam e that was being play ed- that gam e being the effort to weaponize space, to control the Earth from space and space itself. Von Braun had a history of working with weapons system s. He escaped from Germ any to com e to this country and becam e a Vi ce President of Fairchild Industries when I had met him . Von Braun’ s purpose during the last y ears of his life, his dy ing y ears, was to educate the public and decision-m akers about why space-based weapons are dum b, dangerous, destabilizing, too costly , unnecessary , unworkable, and an undesirable idea, and about the alternatives that are available. As practically a deathbed speech, he educated me about those concepts and who the play ers were in this gam e. He gave m e the responsibility , since he was dy ing, of continuing this effort to prevent the weaponization of outer space. When Wernher Von Braun was dy ing of cancer, he asked m e to be his spokesperson, to appear on occasi ons when he was too ill to speak. I did this. What was m ost interesting to m e was a repetitive sentence that he said to me over and over again during the approxim ately four y ears that I had the opportunity to work with him . He said the strategy that was being used to educate the public and decision m akers was to use scare tactics... That was how we identify an enem y. The strategy that Wernher Von Braun taught m e was that first the Russians are going to be considered to be the enem y. In fact, in 1974, they were the enem y, the identified enem y. We were told that they had “killer satellites”. We we re told that they were com ing to get us and control us – that they were “Com mies.” 188"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":" Then terrorists would be identified, and that was soon to follow. We heard a lot about terrorism . Then we were going to identify third-world country “crazies.” We now call them Nations of Concern. But he said that would be the third enem y against whom we would build space-based weapons. The next enem y was asteroids. Now, at this point he kind of chuckled the first tim e he said it. Asteroids- against asteroids we are going to build space-based weapons. And the funniest one of all was what he called a liens, extraterrestrials. That would be the final scare. And over and over and over during the four y ears that I knew him and was giving speeches for him , he would bring up that last card. “And rem ember Carol, the last card is the alien card. We are going to have to build space- based weapons against aliens and all of it is a lie.” I think I was too naïve at that tim e to know the seriousness of the nature of the spin that was being put on the system . And now, the pieces are starting to fall into place. We are building a space-based weapons sy stem on a prem ise that is a lie, a spin. Wernher Von Braun was try ing to hint that to m e back in the early 70’s and ri ght up until the m oment when he died in 1977. What he told m e was that there is an accelerated effort in place. He didn’ t m ention a tim eline but he said that it was going to be speeding up faster than any body could possibly im agine. That the effort to put weapons into space was not only based on a lie but would accelerate past the point of people even understanding it until it was already up there and too late. When Von Braun was dy ing in front of m e, the very first day that I m et him , he had tubes draining out of his side. He was tapping on the desk telling m e, “You will com e to Fairchild.” I was a schoolteacher. He said, “You will com e to Fairchild and y ou will be responsible for keeping weapons out of space.” The way he said it with this intenseness in his ey es, and added that very first day , the first tim e I m et him , that space-based weapons were a dangerous, destabilizing, too costly , unnecessary , untestable, unworkable idea. The last card that was being held was the extr aterrestrial enem y card. The intensity with which he said that, m ade m e realize that he knew som ething that he was too afraid to mention. He was too afraid to talk about it. He would not tell m e the details. I am not sure that I would have absorbed them if he had told m e the deta ils or even believed him in 1974. But there was no question that that m an knew and had a need to know, I found out later. There is no doubt in m y m ind that Wernher Von Braun knew about the extraterrestrial issue. He explained to m e the reasons why weapons were going to be put into space, the enem ies against whom we were going to build these weapons, and that all of that was a lie. He m entioned that extraterrestrials were going to be identifie d as the final enem y against whom we were going to build space-based weapons back in 1974. The way he said it to m e, there was no doubt in m y mind that he knew som ething that he was too afraid to talk about. Wernher Von Braun never spoke to m e about any of the details that he knew related to extraterrestrials except that one day extraterr estrials were going to be identified as an enem y against whom we are going to build an enorm ous space-based weapons sy stem . Wernher Von Braun actually told m e that the spin was a lie – that the prem ise for space-based weaponry , the reasons that were going to be given, the enem ies that we were going to identify – were all based on a lie. 189"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":" I have been tracking the space-based weapons issue for about 26 y ears. I have debated Generals and Congressional Representatives. I have testified before the Congress and the Senate. I have m et with people in over 100 countries. But I have not been able to identify who the people are who are m aking this space-based weapons sy stem happen. I see the news. I see the adm inistrative decisions being m ade. I know that they are all based on lies and greed. But I have y et to be able to identify who the people are. That is after tracking this issue for 26 years. I know that there are big secrets being kept and I know that it is tim e the public and decision-m akers pay attention to the people who ar e now going to be disclosing the truth. Then we need to m ake som e definite changes and build a sy stem in space that will benefit every single person, and all of the anim als, and the environm ent of this planet. The technology is there. The solutions to Earth’s urgent and long-term potential problem s are there. I have a feeling that once we start study ing this extraterrestrial issue, all of the questions are going to be answered that I have had for 26 y ears. But I have concluded that it is based on a few people making a lot of m oney and gaining power. It is about ego. It is not about our essence and who we really are on this planet and loving each other and being at peace and cooperating. It isn’ t about using technology to solve problem s and heal people in the planet. It isn’t a bout that. It is about a few people who really are play ing an old, dangerous, costly gam e for their own pocketbooks and power st ruggle. That is all it is. I believe that this entire space-based weapons ga me is initiated right here in the United States of Am erica. What I hope is that with this inform ation that is being disclosed, the new adm inistration will to do what is right. That is to transform the war gam e into a space gam e so that we use the technologies that are available not just as spin-offs of war technology , but as direct technological applications to build a c ooperative space system that will benefit the entire world and that will allow us to com municate with the extraterrestrial cultures that are obviously out there. Who would benefit from these space-based weapons? They are the people who work in that arena, people in the m ilitary , in industries, in universities and labs, in the intelligence com munity . This is not just in the United States but it is worl dwide. This is a worldwide cooperative sy stem . Wars are cooperative. Just as peace will be when it breaks out. But right now there are a lot of people benefiting. This is what our econom y has been based on in this country and spreading around the world- war. People suffer as a result. It is not fair. It never has been. People have scream ed: “out of swords let us build plow shares, let’ s have peace and hold hands around the world,” but it hasn’ t worked because too m any people are benefiting. Not only are they benefiting financially , but from what m y experien ce is there are people who actually believe that Arm ageddon should happen so we ha ve to have these wars. So it is going from the pocketbook, to the religi ous right: som e people actually believe that we have to have wars for these religious reasons. There are people who just love war. I have m et warriors who just love to go to war. Then ther e are the good people, the soldiers, who just take orders. They have to feed their children and send th em to college so they want to keep their jobs. People in laboratories have told m e that they don’ t want to work on these technologies for war but if they don’ t they won’ t get a pay check. Who is going to pay them ? But what I see is that there are not only dual uses for these technol ogies but there are m any uses for the sam e technologies. 190"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":" We can build space hospitals, schools, hotels, laboratories, farm s, industries. It m ay sound far out but if we don’t do that we are going to bu ild battle stations and weapons pointed down all of our throats and into space. Apparently we have been doing som e of that already . We have a choice now that can be m ade. We can all benef it – all of the people in the m ilitary industrial com plex, in the intelligence com munity , in univers ities and labs, in the United States and all over the world – we can all benefit. We can just tran sform that industry so easily with just a decision based on our highest consciousness, our spirituality , and on the fact that we have no choice unless we all want to die. And we don’t. So we can all benefit financially , spiritually , socially , psy chologically ; it is technologically and politically feasible to transform this gam e now and every body will benefit. In 1977 I was at a meeting in Fairchild Industries in a conference room called the War Room . In that room were a lot of charts on the walls w ith enem ies, identified enem ies. There were other more obscure nam es, nam es like Saddam Hussein and Khadafi. But we were talking then about terrorists, the potential terrorists. No one had ever talked about this before but this was the next stage after the Russians against whom we we re going to build these space-based weapons. I stood up in this meeting and I said, “Excuse m e, why are we talking about these potential enem ies against whom we are going to build space-based w eapons if, in fact, we know that they are not the enem y at this tim e?” Well, they continued the conversation about how they were going to antagonize these enem ies and that at som e point, there was going to be a war in the Gulf, a Gulf War. Now this is 1977, 1977! And they were talking about creati ng a war in the Gulf Region when there was 25 billion dollars in the space-based weapons program that had yet to be identified. It wasn’ t called the Strategic Defense Initiative, at least. No t until 1983. This weapons system , then, had obviously been going on for som e tim e and I didn’t know any thing about. So I stood up in this meeting in 1977 and said, “I would like to know why we are talking about space-based weapons against these enem ies. I would like to know m ore about this. Would som eone please tell m e what this is about?” Nobody answered. They just went on with this m eeting as though I hadn’t said any thing. Suddenly I stood up in the room and said, “If nobody can tell me why you are planning a war in the Gulf when there is a certain am ount of money in a budget so that y ou can create the next set of weapons system s that will be the beginning of the sell to the public about why we need space-based weapons, then consider this: m y resignation. And y ou will not hear from m e again!” And nobody said a word, because they were planning a war in the Gulf and it happened exactly as they planned it, on tim e. SG: Who was at this m eeting? CR: The room was filled with people in the revolving door gam e. There were people that I had seen once in a m ilitary uniform and other tim es in a gray suit and an industry outfit. These people play a revolving door gam e. They work as consultants, industry people, and/or military and intelligence people. They work in the industries and they revolve them selves through these doors and right into governm ent positions. I stood up in this m eeting and asked if I was hearing correctly . That when there was 25 billion dollars expended in the space-based weapons budget, that there was going to be a war in the Gulf, stim ulated, created, so that they could then sell the next phase of weapons to the public and the decision-m akers. This war was going to be created so that they could dum p the old 191"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":" weapons and create a whole new set of weapons. So I had to resign from that position. I could no longer work in that industry . In about 1990 I was sitting in m y living room looking at the m oney that had been spent on space-based weapons research and developm ent program s and I realized that it had com e to that num ber, about 25 billion dollars, and I said to my husband, “I am now going to stop every thing. I am now going to stop and sit and watch CNN tele vision and I am going to wait for the war to happen.” My husband said, “Well, you have finally gone over the edge. Y ou have flipped out.” Friends said, “You have really gone too far this tim e. There is not going to be a war in the Gulf, nobody is talking about a war in the Gulf.” I said, “There is going to be a war in the Gulf. I am going to sit here and wait for the war in the Gulf.” And it happened right on schedule. As part of the war gam e in the Gulf, we in the public were told that the United States was successful in shooting down Russian Scud Missiles. We were rationalizing new budgets based on that success. In fact, we found out later, afte r the budgets were approved for the next phase of weapons, that it was a lie. We did not have successf ul shoot-downs the way we were told. It was all a lie, just to get m ore m oney put in the budget to m ake m ore weapons. I was one of the first people to go independently to Russia when I heard that they had “killer satellites.” [See the testimony of Dr. Paul Czysz. SG] When I went to Russia in the early 70’s, I found out that they didn’t have killer satellites, that it was a lie. In fact, the Russian leaders and peopl e wanted peace. They wanted to cooperate with the United States and with the people of the world. Another tim e I called Saddam Hussein when he was lighting his oil fields on fire. My husband was in the kitchen while I was m aking this phone call. I got a call back from his First Attaché with Saddam Hussein nearby and he asked, “Are y ou a reporter? Are y ou an agent? Why do y ou want to know?” I said, “No. I am just a citizen who help ed to start the m ovem ent to prevent the weaponization of outer space and I have found that a lot of stories that I have been told about weapons system s and the enem ies are not true. I wanted to find out what would satisfy Saddam Hussein so he would stop m aking these oil fields catch fire and stop antagonizing people.” He said, “Well, nobody has ever asked him that question, what he wants.” ... So when I hear that there is a possible threat of extraterrestrials – and I look at the history of thousands of y ears of possible ET visitations, and hear the disclosures of honest military - intelligence-industry people who ha ve had experiences with UFO’ s, with crashes and landings, with live and dead bodies of extraterrestrial beings – I know it is a lie. And if I am ever told that these are enem ies against whom we have to bu ild space-based weapons sy stem s, based on m y own personal experience of having worked in the military industrial com plex on weapons system s and m ilitary strategy , I am going to know it is a lie. It is a lie. Not only will I not believe it, but I am going to go out as loudly as I can and tell every one to take a look. They [the ET’s] have not taken us away yet. We are still here after thousands of 192"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":" years of visits. If in fact they are still visiting us now and we have not been harm ed then we have to look at this as som ething that is not a hostile occurrence.

They are clearly not hostile. We are here. That is enough proof for m e. There is no lim it to how people can choose to liv e on this planet. We have a chance to do that and I think that the window is closing rapidly . I don’t think that we have m uch tim e in which to make that decision. We are too close in too m any way s to having som e horrible disaster happen, having som e sort of war take place, wh ether it is from high technology or an exotic weapons sy stem .

When they arrived they saw a 20-m eter egg-shaped UFO buried in the side of a gorge. He was called back from the craft, arrested, handcuffed and threatened and abusively interrogated. One of the m en told him that the interrogators basically did what they wanted and that they were not under Constitu tional law. Wey gandt believes that this UFO was shot down by a HAWK m issile. JW: Lance Corporal John Wey gandt SG: Dr. Steven Greer JW: I enlisted in the Marine Corp under the de lay ed entry program in July of 1994 while still in high school. I enlisted, of course, in a delay ed entry for a y ear or so. I went to boot cam p on the 18 th of June. I graduated 8 Septem ber 1995. And from there m y MRS was 0311, which was a grunt. In late January of 1996, I was given new orders and was given a new MOS, Military Occupational Skill listing as a 7212 Stinger Avenger. So I was in training to be an air defense gunner on the FIM 92 Alpha stinger m issile, the surf ace to air m issile, and the avenger weapon. And I was in training from February to late May of 1996. After graduating from that school, I was reassigned [ to] a first duty station, second marine air wing, 28 th Marine Air Control Group, Second air defen se battalion troop in North Carolina. I was assigned Battery B in June of 1996 and I went on sev eral Ops, Operations – we call them Ops for short. Basically I was there and I was transferred over to the section for laser strike in February of 1997. When I got back, I was asked if I wanted to go and I said, “Sure” so I volunteered and I was sent to the section. We shipped out in March of that y ear to Peru. We were sent there to provide perim eter security to this radar installation. Basically this radar station was tracking- supposedly -drug aircraft that were exiting in and out of Peruvian and Bolivian air space. One night Sergeant Allen and Sergeant Atkinson cam e to us and said, “Look, we have got a situation where we have an aircra ft crash and it is possibly friendly and they need us to go and secure the crash site.” This is late at night, about 11:00 or 12:00 at night. I was on guard duty that night so I was already up and it was my shift. So we got up at about 3:00 or 4:00 in the m orning and headed out with about five or six hum mers. We drove to where we needed to go and from there we had to hum p th rough the bush. So we got there at about 6:00 or 7:00, just when it started to get light. Well, we found the area real easy because there was a huge gash in the land where som ething had crashed. It didn’t break any thing- I don’t know if y ou have ever been to a crash site where you had trees and they had just broken like in half. Every thing was burned and it was like som ething had alm ost cut warm butter with a knife. It was like som ething on fire or had som e kind of energy like a laser had cut it. It was really strange. Any way, I was in the front with Sergeant Allen and Sergeant Atkinson. And we we re ten or twenty m eters ahead of every one else. We all had m aps and radios a nd com passes so we wouldn’ t get lost. 198"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":" We were the first ones to see this thing. It ha d gone up the hill and then off in the side of the ravine and ridge. This is about a 200-foot ridge, at least -Solid rock. It was buried in the side of a cliff. Any way, we didn’t go straight up, we went to the left and walked up to the top of the ridge and that is when we saw the craft. This was a huge ship. And when I first saw it I was scared. It scared the heck out of m e. I didn’t know what to do. It was really confusing. We all clim bed down a nd it was buried at about a 45-degree angle in the side of the cliff there at th e ridge. This was a steep cliff. It was straight up and down. And it was dripping a sy rup-like liqui d. It was every where. And it was greenish- purple and it kind of fluctuated. You would l ook at it one tim e and then y ou would look at it again and it was alm ost like it was alive and changing but every tim e that y ou looked at it y ou saw a different shade of greenish-purple. There was one light on the ship that slowly went around. And the m achine, I could hear it because it was still functioning and it had like a hum to it. It was like a bass, like say if you unplugged an am p from a guitar, that kind of deep sound and it kind of fluctuated and then finally it just cut off and every thing just seem ed to stop. When I was looking at the craft, it was buried so I could see the back of it and there were these large things that looked liked vents, sort of like a fish gill on the back. I couldn’ t see around the other side and I guess that it was the sam e way on the other side. Again, this liquid that had com e out of the ship got on m y cam mies and it discolored them and ate them alm ost like acid. It ate som e of the hair off m y arm s- I didn’t know that until later on. I was down there with the ship. There were three holes in it. I assum ed that they were hatches but there was no way to tell. They were not flush with the m ain body of the craft. They were, I don’ t know, a few inches below. I knew that there was one on top because you could slightly see it. I don’ t know about the other side . There was another hatch the sam e width and diam eter of the top hatch and it was kind of crooke d to the side and it was half open. I didn’ t see any lights or any thing com ing out of it but I felt this... presence. It is real strange. I think the creatures calm ed m e. It was weird and I think they were try ing to com municate with m e, like, I guess, telepathically . It is really weird and I don’ t believe in any of that stuff. It is like basically sitting in y our car and turning on an a.m . station that is just noise and just turning it up real high. That is what I heard when I first got in there. The ship was about ten m eters in width and about 20 meters in length, that is just an estim ate from what I rem ember. But it was huge. It w as shaped like som ething between an egg and a teardrop. It looked really aerody nam ic at least in the shape. I was close enough to make out detail on it but it was not just sm ooth. There we re bum ps and notches and things on it. It was really organic -it was alm ost like art. It looked like som ething that som eone m ade in a shop. It looked like it could have been hand m ade but out of what and what m aterials, I don’t know. Definitely nothing like titanium . It looked m etal but it didn’ t have any reflection on it. The sun is shining on it and I could see the different shades of the craft and it didn’t reflect any thing. I guarantee that if I had shone a flashlight on it, it wouldn’t have reflected it. 199"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":" I wanted to get inside because som eone- the creat ures I think were calling m e to help them . Every thing was going to be all right. I was so m esm erized and into it and suddenly Sergeant Allen and Sergeant Atkinson were hollering and cussi ng at m e to get the hell out of there. SG : Why ? JW: I think that they were scared and they didn’ t want m e to get hurt. I don’ t know. And they were real pissed off at m e. Basically what happened was after we clim bed back up, the DOE, Departm ent of Energy people were there. They knew about it so I don’t know why we went there still to this day . But any way, I was arrested. I had all m y gear taken from m e by men in black cam mies. They had no nam etags. They were older men, probably in their late 30s or 40s. I was at the site probably fifteen or twenty m inutes- we were the first people on the position. Then there were other people. They had containm ent suits. They must have just gotten there. I don’ t know because we were down in the gorge. When we clim bed up, there were the guy s in the black cam mies. They took m e and put m e on a cot that they had. They had m e cuffed, both hands down, and they had m y legs tied together with those plastic fasteners that the police use. They are kind of like cuffs. And they took m e in this huge 47 and we took off. SG: Did they explain why they were treating y ou this way ? JW: No, they were cussing at m e say ing that I was a “dum b asshole.” “Why don’t you fucking people ever pay attention to orders?” “You weren’t supposed to be there.” “You are not supposed to see this.” “You are going to be dangerous if we let y ou go.” I thought that they were going to kill m e, really . Your question again is how long was I contai ned or subdued. I don’t know. For about two day s I think. They had a Lieutenant Colonel from the Air Force and he did not identify him self. And he told m e, “If we just took y ou out in the jungle, they would never find y ou out there.” [See the similarity of these threats with t hose made to Glen Dennis at Roswell 50 years earlier. SG] I didn’ t want to test him to see if he would really do that so I just said, “Yeah.” And, he said, “You have got to sign these papers. You never saw this.” I “don’ t exist” and “this situation never happened.” And if y ou tell any body , y ou will just com e up m issing. He was real abrasive. Just a cy nical asshole I guess is the best way to put it. They had m e segregated with Air Force personnel for approxim ately three weeks and after that I was sent back. At this facility , I saw there were Am ericans but there were a lot of other nationalities there. There were Chinese. I think Germ ans were there. A lot of other people were at this other base. All they did was take m e to an interrogation room . I sat in there for, I don’ t know, fifteen hours with a light. They put this light in my face and they were y elling at m e. I couldn’ t readily identify any of these guy s but I knew one of them was at the crash site because I recognized him and he was in black fatigues. He was say ing, “What did you see? ” He was like growling. He goes, “Are y ou a patriot? Do y ou like the Constitution?” I’m like, “Yeah.” He said, “W e are on our own program . We don’t obey . We just do what we want.” And they are growling and they are relishing it. They are y elling at me and hollering and cursing. “You didn’ t see any thing. We will do y ou and y our whole goddam n fam ily .” 200"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":" It was basically that for about eight or nine hours... “We are going to take y ou off in a helicopter and we are going to kick y our ass out in the jungle and we are going to end you.” They didn’t phy sically put their hands on m e but I was sitting in a chair and I was handcuffed to the chair and I couldn’ t m ove so basically it was just harassm ent. I didn’ t eat any thing for a whole day . No water. No nothing. I just sat there. The group, m y section was about eight to ten guy s but just m e, Sergeant Allen and Sergeant Atkinson saw this ship. We were the only ones th at saw it. Now the others saw the crash area where it cam e through the jungle. They saw all that . They didn’t go into the ridge. Like I said, we were ten to twenty m eters in front of them and we radioed that we found it and every thing was fine. It was in late March, early April of 1997 when this happened... When I got back to the US I approached Sergean t Allen about it. He is married and has about one or two kids and I went to his house on base. He got all upset and threw m e out of his house. He said he didn’ t want to talk about it. I guess they scared those guy s too. You have got to understand I can’ t speak for the rest of the arm ed services but in the Marine Corp every thing is monolithic: When they are told to do som ething, they are going to do it. If y ou don’t want to go along, they will basically railroad y ou. I didn’t want to keep m y m outh shut about it. I told First Sergeant Powell about it. I don’t think that he is still there any more. We are talking three y ears ago. There was no debris that I saw but there were bi g gashes in the rear of the aircraft. What it looked like is it had been hit with m aybe a surf ace to air m issile. There were a couple of HAWK batteries, that’s Hom ing All the Way Killers – that ’s a low to m edium anti-aircraft m issile. Basically , it doesn’t have to hit the target in orde r to destroy the target. What it does is it gets in proxim ity of it and it has a high explosive fra gm entation warhead and it basically explodes like a big shotgun in the vicinity of the targeted area. And by fragm entation it is suppose to destroy the target or dam age it so it won’t be able to conti nue its m ission. So I think that we shot it down. This is what I think happened. We shot it down. The other guy s [ at the radar facility ] knew it was fly ing. I knew that these aircraft were fly ing because I had been in the Com mand Center there at the radar installation and I heard a coupl e of wom en there in the Air Force talking about aircraft fly ing in and out of the atm osphere at mach ten plus. So these aircraft were fly ing around there. They would reenter the atm osphere. I be lieve that the higher ups knew it was fly ing in the area. This ship was not one of ours. In Stinger Sc hool they teach y ou about all different kinds of aircraft and I knew a lot of aircraft any way. Essentially , when I saw it I said, “This is nothing that I knew of.” Basically , the radar was sitting on a hill and it rotates. There is a com mand bunker that was built under the Earth. It looks like Star Wars in ther e. It is totally air-conditioned. It is really nice. There are com puters and they have the cont rol panels that control the radar and I guess they are linked to other sites and get other data com ing in. Well, one night I was in there checking people goi ng in and out. They have ID’s and I would check them . So these two girls cam e walking out and they were talking, “Well, we have these aircraft fly ing again.” And the other girl said, “Yeah, they are com ing in and out of the 201"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":" atm osphere.” And they log all these flights co ming in. Later a m an com es and gets the logbooks and I had to sign off for him to take all that. When you have objects that reenter the atm osphere and then stop on a dim e and then turn around and go exactly the opposite direction -- that is kind of strange. Meteors don’t do that. SG: Is this som ething that was rare or som ething that was happening all the tim e? JW: Oh, this was happening all the tim e. There were about three or four instances where I was on duty there that the sam e Air Force Officer cam e in there to get the log books. So these craft were tracked from this particular radar a nd were logged in. I guess the reason they were taking them is that they didn’ t want people to know that they were tracking these craft. I am just assum ing that. So I think they knew this craft was com ing in. We can’ t identify it. It is violating airspace here. They could have radioed the Peruvians and sai d to take them out and they shot them down. I am confident that when I saw the aircraft, it ha d been hit by som ething. Som ething had taken it out. I am not doing this to m ake m oney or publicity or any thing but I think it needs to be told. I think that people need to hear it. Whether they agree with m e or not is of no consequence. It is not from Earth. I knew that when I looked at it. I wondered if those facilities were built for the intent to track UFO’s or other objects and their cover was there to track drug aircraft. I don’t know, but from what I understand they were doi ng a whole lot m ore than just tracking drug aircraft. They had laser range finders and all kinds of high tech stuff that I have never seen before. I couldn’ t really explain it. They [the laser range finders] looked like big telescopes but they had them in a bunker and it was able to rise up and zoom around- Just a bunch of weird stuff. The base I was taken to was definitely som ething like NATO or som e m ultinational deal. I keep going back and really thinking about that. Why are all these guy s here? Why would the Chinese be concerned with drugs being sm uggled in to the states? I know for a fact that our governm ent is the one that is im porting drugs. I think that this Com mand Center was perm anent. This thing has been in operation for while... At the crash site there were about thirty of those guy s with hazard suits on, at least. They marched right by m e as I was being taken away . They were m arching to get down the cliff. I guess they were there to check this thing out. I think they went in there and they took every thing out and they shipped it back hom e. The behavior of these people was like this is routine and these guy s were squared away . They knew exactly what they were doing. They ha d been trained to do this stuff before. That was the atm osphere: professional, cold, unassum ing na ture. We are here to do a job. Get the fuck out of our way is basically the attitude. [See the testimony of Clifford Stone who in the 1970s and 80s served on such a retrieval team. SG] I alm ost lost m y m ind after this happened.

I had this obsession with that I guess because of the pain and the experience in the Mari ne Corps, but I just wanted to escape and I was thinking about being with these creatures and wanti ng to go with them and wanting to get out of here... [See the testimony of Larry Warren regarding Airman Burris and how he reacted after the encounter at Bentwaters AFB in the UK. SG] These different agencies are on their own. They don’ t obey the law. They are rogue. Do I think that this is a project that goes up through the governm ent and every one has a piece in it? No. I think these guy s operate on their own and no one knows what they do. It is so easy to do today . And there is no oversight, no control. They just do whatever they want. They are evil. These people are evil. Do I think that it goes to Bill Clinton and the Congress? There may be guy s up there that know about it but they are not going to say any thing. If they say any thing, they are through. Lethal, deadly force has been used. For those of y ou who don’t know, I know m arine snipers and I have heard other guy s talk about it and I’ ve heard that these guy s go on the streets and they stalk people and they kill them . I know that the Arm y Airborne snipers do the sam e thing. They use Delta Force to go grab these people and silen ce them by killing them . If this goes on, where do they get the money to finance all this. Very sim ply, they are selling arm s. They are selling drugs. A lot of this business is about havi ng the spec ops and how they get these unlim ited am ounts of m oney .

Well, there were two way s to do it: I could have either told them that [ or that] I was hom osexual. That wouldn’t have gone over too well. So I went over to First Sergeant Powell and I told him that I wanted to get out and what was the quickest way to get out and he said, “Tell them you sm oked marijuana. Only tell them that you sm oked it once.” So I told them that and they had the CID guy com e and talk to m e and I said, “Yeah, I sm oked m arijuana.

Filer III Novem ber 2000 Major George Filer was an Air Force Intelligence Officer who not only had an extraordinary encounter with a m assive UFO on radar over the United Kingdom but later, in the 1970s while he was at McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey , found out that an extraterrestrial biological entity had b een shot at Fort Dix. The Extraterrestrial fled to adjacent McGuire Air Force Base, where it died on the tarm ac. He testifies that this life form was then picked up and taken to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Afterwards, m any of the key personnel on the base who had a connection with this event, were quickly transferred. Major Filer also points out that the ridicule factor has been very effective at silencing people who have seen ETs or UFOs, and has helped to maintain secrecy . GF: Major George Filer SG: Dr. Steven Greer GF: My nam e is George A. Filer, III. I was in the U.S. Air Force and m y final rank was major. I was a navigator in various aircraft and tanker transport aircraft. I was an intelligence officer m ost of m y career, and in that period, frequently briefed genera ls and congressm en on our capabilities and the threat to our forces. Well, I was a briefing officer, and I would com e to work [ at] 4:00 or so in the m orning. On the m orning of January 18, 1978, I drove through the m ain gate at McGuire, and I noticed that there were red lights out on the runway , and that probably som ething was going on out there. [ I] didn’t think too much about it until I got to the 21 st Air Force Com mand Post, [which] was where I worked. I was the Deputy Director of Intelligence for the 21 st Air Force, which controlled half the m ilitary aircraft that flew the presidents and the various VIPs from the Mississippi River around to India. We had som e 300 aircraft, and we were fly ing all kinds of m issions — alm ost any thing that had to do with m ilitary airlift, we accom plished. This particular m orning, when I went into the com mand post, I was m et by the head of the com mand post, and he said that it [had] been a very exciting evening — that [ we’d] had UFOs over McGuire all night, that one had apparently landed or, possibly , crashed at Fort Dix, and that when a m ilitary policem an cam e upon the alien, that he had pulled out a gun and shot him . And I said, foreigner, [ that kind of] alien? I was a little bit confused by him say ing alien. And he said, “No, an alien from outer space.” He was very sp ecific about the fact that an alien from outer space had been shot at Fort Dix, and that he had run away after being wounded, and headed for McGuire. Now McGuire and Fort Dix just have a fence between them , and this alien apparently clim bed the fence or went under it, and got to Mc Guire and died out on the end of the runway . The security police were out there and had capture d the body , so to speak, and were guarding it. He said that a C-141 from Wright-Patterson was com ing in to pick up the body . That m ade m e stand up, because I didn’ t realize that Wright Patterson had C-141s — I thought Military Airlift Com mand was the only one who owned C-141 aircraft — so I was like, my gosh, what’s going on here? He said, “We want you to brief us at the standup general briefing this m orning and explain what happened to every body .” And, I sai d you want me to tell General Tom Sadler and every body in the com mand post that we captured an alien?! They said, “Yes, we want y ou to brief [ them ] this morning.” Well, I did som e checking around, and I called the 38 th Military Airlift Wing Com mand Post to check with them to see if the 206"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":" story was the sam e as I was given. They said, y es, that they had heard the sam e inform ation; they said that this actually did happen — that an alien was found on the base. Later that m orning, I was told that they deci ded not to brief it in the standup briefing, so I didn’t actually brief it. Later that morning, I carried the code word down to General Sadler’s office, and I noticed som e com motion going on in there, and that som e of the security police people were there, looking rather disheveled. Si nce General Sadler was a stickler for every one looking perfect, it was surprising to see these peopl e that obviously needed shaves and were in fatigues, so then I knew that this m ight tie into the story that I had heard. After the briefing I went to the photo lab; alm ost every day I went to the photo lab, because in these briefings, y ou have four screens and y ou have to keep them all filled up with pretty pictures, and so on. There, they indicated that they ha d taken pictures of som ething extraordinary , and I said, well, let m e see them . The sergeant was handi ng them to m e, when his m aster sergeant said, “He can’ t see those,” so all I knew is that they had som e pictures that I wasn’ t allowed to see — but norm ally , being the general’ s briefer — I had never been stopped from seeing any pictures that they had. It was a very serious operation. There are nuclear assets on the base — they used to carry nuclear weapons back and forth to Europe — and I talked to one of the security policem en who [claim ed] to have been out there. He indicat ed that he essentially saw a sm all body that could have been like a child, but it seem ed to have a larger-than-norm al head. One interesting thing is that many of the key personnel on the base at that tim e who had a connection with this event, were quickly transferred — from the wing com mander on down — indicating that if y ou knew som ething, they tended to split y ou up, so to speak, so y ou couldn’t talk about it. This was done within a matter of weeks. The security policem an told m e that he was transferred within a few day s — as a m atter of fact, he was taken to Wright Patterson within a day or two, debriefed by a num ber of people, a nd essentially told not to talk about it any more. I also heard that they listened to this going on, on the radios, and they heard that this chase was on; that the alien had been shot at Fort Dix. They were chasing it towards McGuire — for whatever reason, it chose to run towards McGuir e Air Force Base — and that both the state police and the m ilitary police were chasing this person or alien that cam e from what looked like a UFO. As I understand it, it was a disc-shaped craft. They indicated to m e that the UFOs had been in the area for quite som e tim e that evening, that they had [them ] on radar, and that the to wer operator had seen them . Som e of the other aircraft in the area had apparently seen them as well. There were six or eight people guarding the body ; then there was the com mander of the security police, and a few of us in the com mand post [who knew of this event] . I assum e that General Sadler was briefed about it. SG: Have y ou learned of other UFO even ts while y ou were in the m ilitary ? GF: Well, I happened to m eet a lady who was at White Sands, and was an engineer working out there. She was out hiking one day , and she to ld m e that she and a couple of her friends had com e up to the top of a hill, and they had looke d down in this valley , but only their heads were showing on the top of the hill. They just happe ned to be looking over, and down the way the path was, and they saw a UFO on the ground with a coupl e of little aliens picking up rocks and things. 207"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":" They watched it for an extensive period; it w as only several hundred y ards away from them , and they got a pretty good look at it. And eventually the aliens did see them , and they jum ped in the craft and took off. I had personally never seen any thing until about 1962, when we were fly ing tankers over England, and London Control asked us to intercep t a UFO. We happened to be done with our refueling m ission, and we accepted the assignm ent. We were just over the North Sea, and they asked us to fly to the center of England. We were doing som e 400 miles an hour in a dive down to intercept this object. They gave us h eadings, and it was pretty m uch hovering in the Stonehenge area — Oxford, to the Stonehenge area, at 20-30 m iles out. I got it on radar, and it was a very large return. We used to fly up by the Forth of Frith Bridge, which was kind of like the San Francisco Bridge — it is a very large bridge, and the retu rn of the UFO was sim ilar to that in size and intensity . In other words, it was a very larg e radar return. Obviously , London Control had it on their radar, and they were vectoring us to this object. When we got about a mile from the UFO, it just took off into space — several thousand m iles an hour, alm ost directly up. Frankly , at least to my knowledge, we had nothing like that capability . My best guess is that it was a disc-ty pe craft, but a fat disc — at least, there were lights som ething like this at the top and at the bottom . It was m ore than just a straight plate-like object; it had a dom e on the top of it. If the radar return was accurate, it was probabl y 500 yards across in size, or som ething — I mean it was a huge thing. We wrote it in the navigator’s log. I also had a sighting here, where we live. Th is is Briarwood Lake in Medford, New Jersey ; we had just m oved into this house. We were asleep — I’m just guessing it was 3:00 in the morning, asleep with m y wife — and, suddenly , the room got very bright in the m iddle of the night. I got up out of bed, and opened up the shade, and looked outside. I don’t know if m ost people have seen a subm arine surfacing with all the water com ing up — well, this was like a disc about 30 feet in diam eter surfacing, and what looked to m e like water com ing off of it. Around the craft was this ionization — very sim ilar to the Aurora Borealis. It m oved across the lake for a while, and then flew off at a fair ly high rate of speed. Because of that, I have checked with a lot of the neighbors, and it’ s am azing how m any people have actually seen craft on these lakes. Also, occasionally I used to do briefings on the UFO sightings that had occurred around the world, to the generals. One that sticks out in m y m ind is 1976 — there was a fam ous encounter near Tehran. Around that tim e, this particular colonel was telling m e that the F-106 had set the world’s record for speed. They had these aircraft going as fast as they could, and they would be diving on this UFO that was hovering in a valley in Colorado. Just like m y experience in England, when they got near the craft, it took off and left them standing still. They were doing 1,500 m ph or som ething — whatever the top speed was at that tim e for these aircraft in a dive — but whoever was fly ing these had capabilities far bey ond any thing that we had for y ears and y ears — I think even today . 208"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":" I think these are som ething alien: it is a non-hum an [ craft] that has a different form of propulsion and is com ing here and doing reconnaissance. I’ve talked to a num ber of astronauts who have seen them ; I’ ve talked to other m ilitary pilots who have seen them , and I rem ember Captain Ram idge who I used to work for in Athens, Greece — he had one during the Korean War fly right off his wing, stay with him like for an hour — not only off his wing, but [ doing] acrobat things around his aircraft! I don’t know the exact percentage of people, but som ething like 10 percent of the pilots and aircrews that y ou ask about it have had sightings. I sat in this room here a few y ears ago, and a colonel who was in Intelligence told m e he had his whole B-52 crew see a UFO. You know, these people don’ t volunteer and sit in front of the cam era and tell about it, but there are an awful lot of people who have seen them . They know that they have advanced capabilities. They usually see som e kind of a solid object that appears to be made of som e kind of m etal — usually a gunm etal gray . Particularly at night, people usually report various lights around them . SG: What happened to the ET at McGuire? GF: It seem s to m e that I was told that it was put in som e kind of a casket and flown away . I also think that in 1947, in that tim e fram e, som ething crashed out West. I think that som ething happened out there, at least based on what y ou m ight say is the talk in the m ilitary . The tendency is to m ake things classified when y ou don’ t know what’ s happening — secret, top secret or whatever — and if it com es down from the President, it’ s a very high classification: probably a code word above top secret. In other wo rds, need to know that kind of thing, and once that caveat or designation is put on som ething, it’s very difficult to get it downgraded. You can go to the archives and despite what they tell y ou, they have things going back to the Second World War that you still are not allowed to look at. Once these things are top secret, it just kind of m oves on and forever stay s top secret. You can base it on the fact, for exam ple, that this craft had advanced technological capabilities, so y ou don’t want the other side to know what y ou know, and how these things work — it’ s to y our advantage to keep this secret. But, I think that it’ s tim e that these various program s com e out. The way that it’ s been kept secret to this extent is through ridicule. If it was just a m atter of it being top secret, I think m ost of the world would know about it today , but they put in a kind of ridicule factor. You will hear som eone telling a story like this, and people will say , well, he m ust be crazy — he believes in UFOs. And, they brought this ridicule out when any one saw any thing, but my experience has been an awful lot of policem en have seen these; an awful lot of FBI have seen these; an awful lot of m ilitary have seen these. At tim es I used to carry nuclear weapons. In other words, I was mentally fit to carry nuclear weapons, but I’ m not m entally fit if I see a UFO. This criticism and this ri dicule have done m ore to keep the story [from ] com ing out than alm ost any thing else. [We hear this over and over from military and ot her witnesses: the media and official ridicule is so intense, that it has served as a powerf ul force for silence and secrecy. Most people do not want to expose themselves or their families to su ch ridicule, and instead choose to remain quiet.

In his testim ony , we will learn of incontrovertible evidence in sever al events with m assive objects m oving at extraordinary speeds, witnessed by m ilitary personnel with im peccable credentials, and tracked on radar — objects which are not m anufactured on this Earth. He will also confirm the Bentwaters case and other cases within the United Kingdom , and acknowledge the existence of extensive governm ent files on the UFO phenom enon. Mr. Pope supports total openness and honesty on the UFO issue, and believes that there should be a full disclosure of all inform ation on UFOs, held by governm ents all around the world. NP: Mr. Nick Pope SG: Dr. Steven Greer NP: My nam e is Nick Pope. I’m a serving official with the British Ministry of Defense, which I joined in 1985. I’ve done a num ber of diffe rent tours of duty there, the m ost relevant of which is from 1991 to 1994, when I was posted to a division called Secretariat Air Staff. My duties there were to research and investigate the UFO phenom enon for the British governm ent. I received som ewhere between two and three hundred UFO reports each y ear. My job was to evaluate these [and] to com e to a decision about whether there was evidence of any threat to the defense of the United Kingdom . After an in-depth investigation, 90-95 percent of those sightings turned out to have prosaic explanations, but we were left with a hard core of sightings, which defied any conventional explanation whatsoev er. These were a num ber of interesting cases involving sightings by m ilitary personnel, near m isses between UFOs and aircraft, instances where UFOs were tracked on radar, and cases wher e UFOs were captured on film and video. Over the y ears in which the British governm ent has been looking at the UFO phenom enon, there have been num erous cases in which uncorrelated targets have been tracked by m ilitary flight controllers and, certainly , on a num ber of those occasions, m ilitary jets were either diverted from task or, indeed, scram bled, to try and intercept these objects — not to engage them in any hostile sense, but m erely to close with them to identify them . Now, on those occasions, I have to say , we have not been successful in our attem pts to m ake an interception. Invariably , we find that the sp eeds and maneuvers of the UFOs are way ahead of the best things in our inventory , with regard to aircraft. They run rings around us, frankly . On occasion — when m ilitary jets have actually been chasing UFOs to try and get gun cam era footage, or to try and close within visual range to get an ID on what the m ystery craft is, these things have shown that not only are they capable of phenom enal bursts of speed, but also the capacity to just stop and turn in an instant, raising all sorts of issues about the G-force im plicit in such a m aneuver — G-forces, which frankly , even with the best G-suit, would be far too m uch, I think, for any hum an to survive. That, in itself, raises interesting questions about who’ s operating these things. 210"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":" To pick a few cases to talk about which are par ticularly im pressive, I think one has to perhaps start back in 1956, with a radar visual sighti ng that took place near the Bentwaters area. Incidentally , this was one of the cases written up in Project Blue Book and judged to be particularly specific. To cut a long story short, there were fighter controllers who picked up a radar target, which was not readily identifiable as one of our own aircraft. So, we sim ply took a look at that and judged that there was indeed a solid structured craft in the air. It was traveling at a phenom enal speed com pared to the envelope, as it were, of our own fighters. Jets were launched, and, indeed, the pilots di d m anage to close and get a visual sighting on this object. They just described it as som e sort of structured, possibly disk-shaped craft, but frankly , it was just too fast and m aneuverable for them to get a really clear view. Again, it ran rings around them . So, that was an interesting exam ple — one of m any of these craft display ing speeds and m aneuvers which we couldn’t hope to m atch. To throw in an exam ple of a [ much m ore] m odern sighting and one that I was directly involved in the investigation of [ was] on the 30 th and 31 st of March, 1993 [ when] a series of UFO encounters took place over Great Britain — the m ost interesting of which involved an occasion where two air force bases were actually overflown by a large triangular or diam ond-shaped UFO. The two establishm ents involved in this are RAF Co sford and RAF Shorebury , in the Midlands. At RAF Cosford, this part of the sighting happened in the early hours of the 31 st , about ten past one in the m orning. The guard patrol at Cosford saw this UFO fly directly over the base. They , of course, phoned in an im mediate report, and found, interestingly , there was nothing showing up on radar at all — even though they had this thing going right over their heads. They phoned, am ongst other people, their colleagues at RA F Shorebury , which is about ten or twelve miles down the road. The meteorological officer took the phone call. You have to understand, there is only a skeleton staff at these establishm ents , so the “Met” officer there took the call, went outside, perhaps just thinking, really , that this was people play ing a trick on him . But, sure enough — in the distance he saw a bright light heading his way . This thing got closer and closer. The way he described it to m e, voice shaking with em otion the following morning, was like a m assive flat triangular-shaped craft, possibly raised a little bit like a diam ond, passing over his head at a height of m aybe no m ore than 200 feet, slightly to one side, em itting a low frequency hum ming sound, which he said he could not only hear but feel. Intriguingly , this craft was firing a narrow beam of light down at the fields just bey ond the perim eter fence of the m ilitary base. He said that this object cam e toward him at a speed of probably no m ore than 20 or 30 m iles an hour — very slowly . Suddenly , the light retracted up into the craft and, in an instant, it shot off to the horizon in a matter of seconds. Bear in m ind, this is an Air Force officer with eight y ears experience in the service. He sees aircraft and fast jets every day of his life. He said the speed of this thing was probably about ten tim es the speed of an Air Force jet. When I asked him to estim ate the size of this m ystery craft, with ty pical m ilitary precision he said it was probably m idway between a C- 130 Hercules transport aircraft and a Boeing 747 jum bo jet. I launched a full investigation into this incide nt, and in fact, this was one of a series of sightings that took place over the entire country on that particular night, involving not just members of the public, but num erous police officers, particularly in the s outhwest of England and in Wales, and also in the Midlands. I m ade all the usual checks. We im pounded the radar tapes and had them sent up to the Ministry of Defense main building. We m ade all the series of checks 211"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":" that we could possibly m ake — checking for ever ything from satellite tracks and reentry into the Earth’ s orbit of space debris, to astronom ical phe nom ena, m eteorites, fireballs, m ilitary aircraft exercises, weather balloon launches — however unlikel y this was, we checked. That was alway s the philosophy — y ou check every thing in this business. We drew a com plete blank, and at the end of about a week or so of pretty solid work on this, I put a report up the chain-of-com mand through m y Head of Division to the Assistant Chief of the Air Staff — an Air Vice Marshal Two-Star Air Force Officer. We put this up to him , and we basically said that an uncorrelated target, an unide ntified craft — but not just a light or a shape — a structured craft of unknown origin, penetrated what we call the UK ADR, the United Kingdom Air Defense Region. On that particular night, it flew without bei ng tracked on radar, without any aircraft being launched, and flew with total im punity over two military establishm ents and over a large part of the rest of the country — and then disappeared, object unexplained. The Assistant Chief of the Air Staff thought long and hard about that. I s uppose it was a Catch-22 situation. He sim ply cam e back and he said, “It’ s a very interesting case, but y ou’ ve clearly run all the checks that you can m ake. There is frankly nothing m ore we can do, but it’ s fascinating.” Now, I think when that went up the chain-o f-com mand, we certainly changed a few people’s minds there about the whole nature of the UF O phenom enon, and we got, I think, a num ber of senior civil servants and m ilitary officers to really realize that on their watch, as it were, this occurred and was not just nonsense. The UFO phe nom enon is not just lights and shapes in the sky . It’s real, it’s solid; it can involve the m ilita ry as m uch as any one else. I think that that rem ains one of the most significant cases ever to have taken place in Britain, and frankly , it shows — if indeed there is any doubt rem aini ng — the serious defense and national security issues raised by the whole UFO phenom enon. Over the years, there have been a num ber of film s taken by m ilitary aircraft through gun cam eras. Now, unfortunately , this film footage does not seem to exist any more, but one of m y predecessors who headed up the division where I work ed under its previous title of DS8, that is Defense Secretariat 8, was a m an called Ralph Noy es. He is som eone who, before his death, also as a Ministry of Defense em ploy ee, spoke out publicly about the reality of the UFO phenom enon and m ade the point to all who would listen that there was a serious phenom enon here, and it did need and deserve serious study . Now, Ralph certainly did see those bits of film footage [ gun cam era footage of UFOs from m ilitary aircraft] . Ralph told me — and indeed, I think his testim ony has gone onto the written record as well — that he was called to a briefing of senior Air Force personnel, and that they all gathered around to look at som e of this footage that had com e after a chase where a m ilitary jet had been sen t up to try and get a closer look at a UFO. Ralph Noy es told me that he and all these people on the Air Staff just sat around gasping with astonishm ent — looking, pointing, wondering — but frankly , not able to really take it that much further, except, again, the im plicit acknowledge ment that there are things operating in our airspace that have better capabilities than we do. When I say that, of course, I include the point about prototy pe craft, because one of the points that is often put forward about the UFO phenom enon is the fairly reasonable question: Couldn’ t it be that what you are seeing when y ou talk about structured craft with high speeds and extraordinary m aneuvers, is just the next generation of Air Force planes — prototy pe devices, whether they be aircraft or rem otely piloted vehicles? 212"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":" Well, speaking as a serving m ember of the Ministry of Defense and having done the UFO job for three y ears, I can tell any one who m akes that poi nt that yes, of course, at any given tim e, there are prototy pe aircraft and devices that we operate , but we know where we operate our own bits of kit. We operate them in very carefully cont rolled and defined ranges a nd danger areas, and we do not make mistakes about UFOs and prototy pes. We don’t go chasing UFOs if it’s a prototy pe. We can tell the difference. So, when the public sees som ething — who knows? It depends where they see it. But, when we’ re talking about m ilitary sightings, and when we’ re talking about the research and investigation that I did, if I had stum bled onto a prototy pe test, then “A” I would have known, and “B” if I hadn’t known, I would have been told. And, of course we would have butted out of that pretty quick. Britain’ s most fam ous UFO case is the Randelsham Forest incident, which is som etim es also referred to as the Bentwaters Case. That involved a series of UFO incidents over a num ber of nights in Decem ber of 1980, involving nom inally the Roy al Air Force Bases, but in fact, they were operated by the United States Air Force. They were RAF Bentwaters and RAF Woodbridge in Suffolk. [See the testimony of Larry Warren, Lori Rehfeldt , Clifford Stone, Lord Hill-Norton, et al. SG] Now, in this case, there were a series of enc ounters where som e people saw lights in the sky perform ing extraordinary m aneuvers, but m uch m ore significantly , on the first night of activity , people saw a structured m etallic craft actually m oving — not up in the sky — but right down pretty m uch at ground level. It was m oving through Randelsham Forest, which adjoins the two bases. At one point, this sm all m etallic, roughly triangular-shaped craft seem ed to actually com e down and land in a particular clearing. Now, all the witnesses to this are m ilitary personnel: they ’re trained observers; they don’ t make m istakes. Som e of the skeptics have sugg ested that this could have been a mistaken sighting of a nearby lighthouse. That’ s nonsense for two reasons: firstly , these were trained military observers who actually were fam iliar w ith the lighthouse and saw it pretty much every night of their tour of duty , [and] secondly , certainly at one point in the encounter, the lighthouse was clearly visible at the sam e tim e as the UFO. So, this sim ply could not have been the lighthouse, as the skeptics som etim es suggest. Although this case predated m y own tour of duty by ten y ears, a little more, I reviewed the case and I looked through the file. I tried to reopen th e investigation into this incident. The m ost im portant thing that I was able to focus on was, in fact, phy sical evidence that som ething had taken place, because after this craft had touched down, people went back in the light of day to the landing site and found that where they ’d seen this craft land there were, in fact, three triangular indentations on the forest floor. What I m ean by that is there were three indentations which, when y ou drew lines between them , were pretty much in the shape of a perfect equilateral triangle. One of the things that was done, was that the ar ea was checked for radiation. This is where I cam e in. I took the readings that were taken, [and] it’ s im portant to say these readings peaked in two places: they peaked in the indentations them selves, and also [ in] som e dam age that was done to the sides of the trees in the clearing — as if this thing had com e down and snapped off som e branches and stripped off som e bark; as it had done so either com ing in or going out. 213"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":" I sent the figures that had been recorded at th e tim e by Lieutenant Colonel Charles Halt, who was the deputy base com mander — him self a witness at som e of these incidents. I sent the data from Halt and his team to the Defense Radiological Protection Service, which is part of the Ministry of Defense. They cam e back to m e, and they were frankly bem used by this whole thing, and they said that the radiations from the i ndentations in the ground were ten tim es background for that area — ten tim es what they should have been. Now of course, it is im portant to say that the levels were still com paratively low: Halt and his team were not endangered by this. This was still low-level radiation. But again, looking at it from a scientific point of view, that’s not the point. The point is that when com pared with control readings im mediately outside of the area, y ou had this peak of ten tim es norm al right where this craft cam e down on the forest floor. So, that, I think is extrem ely significant, because it involved sightings by trained m ilitary observers and, also, at one point, this craft was tracked on radar from a nearby base, RAF Watten. So, you had sightings on radar, sightings by traine d m ilitary personnel, and after the event, in the cold light of day , the undeniable, scientific, m ethodological evidence of the radiation readings. So, that, by any one’ s standards, has to be an extrem ely significant event, and proof, I think, bey ond all question of doubt, that there was an unknow n craft in that particular clearing on that particular night. I have seen witness statem ents from the m ilitary personnel, and I’ ve heard testim ony from som e of those involved that suggests that m uch m ore went on that particular night, than even went into the file that ended up in the Ministry of Defense. There are also incidents where it’ s claim ed that UFOs have taken an extrem e interest in civilian nuclear power stations, m ilitary in stallations with nuclear assets, etc. [At the time it was secret that nuclear weapons were at the Bentwaters Air Force Base under U.S. control. SG] During my tour of duty in Secretariat Air Staff at the Ministry of Defense, I operated a very open policy with regard to the UFO issue. I made it my business to be quite open and honest about the official research and investigation that I was doing, and not to suppress any data on this. I believe that governm ents and the m ilitary , a nd indeed private researchers, politicians — whoever — should place every thing in the public dom ain on this issue. Governm ents can’ t, I think, have it both way s. You cannot say on the one hand, as the party line often goes, that UFOs are of no defense significance, and then on the other, keep back som e of the data. You sim ply can’t do that. You have to have it one way , or the other. And if, as governm ents consistently say when the politicians probe on this issue or when the m edia inquire, that there’s really nothing to worry about, then okay , let’ s see a ll the data. Let’ s check that that decision is a valid one, reached through a proper m ethodology . I, in support of that aim , believe that there should be a full disclosure of all inform ation on UFOs held by governm ents all around the world. I think there are som e encouraging signs that that’s beginning to happen. I know, for exam ple, that early in 2000 at a conference in San Marino, which was part sponsored by the Ministry of Tourism there, so it had an official flavor to it, the Italian Air Force actually sent a delegation on duty , in uniform , to talk about UFO cases received by the Italian Air Force and Ministry of De fense over the y ears. I’ m also aware that this 214"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":" has happened in Chile. As I’ve sai d, m y own efforts to try and be very open with this and to push data into the public dom ain as well, I hope, ha ve taken the issue forward som ewhat. Yes, I am a supporter of total openness and honesty on this issue. Clearly , it’ s a very im portant issue: one that raises im portant defense and national security issues, but these are not issues that should be addressed by a sm all clique and any one grouping of people. These are issues of global significance, which should be a ddressed and debated by every one. Indeed, we cannot make a full and proper assessm ent of the phe nom enal data we have, without bringing in all sorts of people — scientists, politicians, military experts — in a m uch wider way than perhaps this inform ation is available now. I’ve made no secret of the fact that I believe som e of these UFOs m ay well be of extraterrestrial origin. I know that that’s an extraordinary statem ent fo r a serving officer in the Ministry of Defense to m ake. I don’t m ake it, of course, as an official announcem ent — it is m e speaking in a private capacity — but it is me speak ing on the basis of three y ears official research and investigation; three y ears of m e looking at new sightings com ing in, and reviewing the 250 or 300-odd case files held by either the Ministry of Defense or the Public Record Office on the UFO issue, som e of which were classified secret at th e tim e. So, I don’ t m ake these statem ents lightly , and I don’t do so on the basis of a blind leap of faith. I do it on the basis of the data held by governm ent. It’s im portant, as well, to say that I am not alone in this assessm ent; th at even within the Ministry of Defense in Britain and at the Air Fo rce and indeed political establishm ent, I am not a lone voice here. The Ministry of Defense is not a great indivisible organization — like any thing else, it is a collection of individuals. So, when you talk about governm ent, the m ilitary , and the establishm ent — whatever grouping y ou talk about — what y ou’re really talking about is a group of individuals. I’ve found that there are skeptics and believers in the world of officialdom , and there are more believers in an extraterrestrial presence than m any m ight expect — particularly in the Air Force. When you go out and speak to the Air Force in Britain, som ebody m ay have had a sighting, som ebody m ay have tracked an unco rrelated target on radar, or [ have seen] it do maneuvers that we couldn’ t possibly m atch. Either som ebody has had these experiences them selves, or knows of som ebody — a friend, a colleague — who’s had the sam e thing. At the beginning of m y tour of duty , I did m ake som e effort to establish a dialogue with opposite num bers, particularly in Am erica. I was given the party line, I guess, that officially the Am ericans had been out of UFO investigations since 1969, when Project Blue Book was closed down. I didn’t, frankly , have tim e to follow that up and probe deeper. SG: How m uch assistance did y our investiga tions receive from , for exam ple, the NSA facility at Menwith Hill or the National Reconnaissance Office satellite program s that do reconnaissance? Did y ou receive any confirm ations from those entities or assistance from those entities? NP : I don’t want to talk, I’m afraid, about an y liaison with certain agencies on this. All I will say , in very general term s, is that if I had a particularly interesting case on which I felt I needed assistance from any other ag ency , with any other capability or bit of hardware, then, I would ask through channels. But really , m ost of the UFO cases that cam e m y way I was happy with the assets that I had, and really did day -to-day research and investigation using national 215"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":" assets such as the UK Air Defense Region radar sta tions, the ballistic m issile early warning center at RAF Filingdales, and such like. I don’t want to go m uch further than that. Suffice to say that there have been a st eady stream , over the y ears, of good-quality cases which I think would convince any open-m inded ob server who actually looked at the data, that there was som ething here which went significantly further than just lights in the sky . And som ething which, whatever the claim s that ar e som etim es m ade about this phenom enon, suggests that som ething of extrem e defense significance is happening, not just in UK airspace, but indeed I think, in airspace all around the world. In Britain, at the Public Record Office at presen t, there are about thirty UFO files open to the public. In total, I believe, there are between ar ound about 250 and 300 files. Som e of those were classified secret; now, of course, [are] declassified. Britain will get its Freedom of Inform ation Act shortly . I hope and believe that m ost, if not all, of the British governm ent and m ilitary UFO files will soon be released. What there is, however, is a body of evidence which when placed end to end and looked at by any dispassionate observer with any m ilitary or sci entific experience, will constitute proof of the reality of this phenom enon. One im portant fact about the British wave of sightings in March, 1993, was that it happened three y ears to the very night after the wave of sightings that rocked the establishm ent in Belgium , and led to the scram bling of F-16s. That, again, was late on the 30 th and in the early hours of the 31 st of March. So, it’s one of those very inter esting facts that perhaps two of Europe’ s m ost significant UFO waves actually happened on the very sam e night of the y ear, three y ears apart. Although it predated my involvem ent, one of the m ost significant waves of sighting in Europe took place over Belgium in March of 1990. On that occasion, UFOs were seen by large num bers of people on the ground, and tracked on rada r, resulting in two F-16 fighter interceptors being scram bled. These aircraft then picked up th e UFOs them selves on their airborne radar, and an intriguing gam e of cat and m ouse play ed itself out in the skies of Belgium over the next hour or so. Although that happened before I w as posted into Secretariat Air Staff, I m ade contact with the British air attaché in Brussels. I asked him , really for m y own peace of mind and for my own background research, to confirm the reality of that. He had certainly spoken directly to one or both of the F-16 pilots and to the senior m ilitary officer involved in this, Colonel DeBrouer. And certainly the word that cam e back to m e officially , via our em bassy , was y es, this incident happened pretty m uch as reported. Yes, there was a solid-structured craft there, which m ade som e m aneuvers way ahead of the F-16s. And as a sort of unofficial aside, there was a com ment going around the Belgian Air Staff, which was to the effect of, “Thank goodness they were friendly .” [See the testimony of Clifford Stone regarding the Belgian events and the official government documents.

In this short interview, he states that this subject has great significance and should no longer be denied and kept secret. He em phatically states, “...that there is a serious possibility that we are being visited — and have been visited for m any years — by people from outer space, from other civilizations; that it behooves us to find out who they are, where they com e from , and what they want. This should be the subject of rigorous scientific investigation, and not the subject of rubbishing by tabloid newspapers.” I know a good bit about the Bentwaters incident . I’ve interviewed a num ber of the people who took part in it, and what I have decided after careful thought, is that there are only two explanations for what happened that night in Su ffolk. The first is that the people concerned — including Colonel Halt, who was, at the tim e, the Deputy Com mander of the Base, and a lot of his soldiers — claim that som ething from outside th e Earth’ s atm osphere landed at their air force base. They went and stood by it; they inspected it; they photographed it. The following day they took tests on the ground where it had been and found radioactive traces; they reported this. Colonel Halt wrote a m emorandum , which was sent to our Ministry of Defense. He has appeared on British television at least once, to m y knowledge — possibly more often — in which he has repeated, effectively , wh at he said in that m emorandum . What he said is what I have just described. That is one expl anation — that it actually happened as Colonel Halt reported. The other explanation is that it didn’ t. In that case, one is bound to assum e that Colonel Halt and all his m en were hallucinating. My position is perfectly clear — either of those explanations is of the utm ost defense interest. It has been reported and claim ed — and I, m yself, have raised it to m inisters at the Defense Ministry in this country — that nothing they have been inform ed about regarding UFOs is of defense interest. Surely , to any sensible person, either of those explanations cannot fail to be of defense interest . That the Colonel of an Am erican Air Force Base in Suffolk and his m ilitary m en are hallucina ting when there are nuclear-arm ed aircraft on the base — this m ust be of defense interest. And, if indeed what he say s took place, did take place — and why on Earth should he m ake it up — then, surely , the entry of a vehicle from outer space (and certainly not m anm ade) to a defense base in this country also cannot fail to be of defense interest. It sim ply isn’ t any good for our ministers — and the Ministry of Defense in particular — to say that nothing took place that Decem ber night in Suffolk, or that it is not of defense interest. It sim ply isn’ t true. Since m y nam e has becom e connected with UFO matters in quite a big way in this country , and in one or two other countries too, I have frequently been asked why a person of m y background — a form er Chief of the Defense Sta ff, a form er Chairm an of the NATO Military Com mittee — why I think there is a cover-up, or what the reasons m ay be for governm ent’s wishing to cover up the facts about UFOs. A num ber of explanations have often been put forward. The m ost frequent, and perhaps the m ost plausible, is the governm ent’s concern (which [is] prim arily that of the United States, and that of m y own country ) over the public’ s reaction if 224"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"they [were] told the truth — which is that there are objects in our atm osphere which are technically m iles in advance of any thing that we can deploy , that we have no m eans of stopping them com ing here, and that we have no defe nse against them , should they be hostile. I believe governm ents fear that if they did disclose those facts, people would panic: people would rush about and jam switchboards like they di d that fam ous day in New Jersey , when there was a spoof that the Martians [had] landed — people will go m ad, and they will jum p up and down. I don’t believe that at all — I’ve said so in print. I do not believe that people today , in the 21 st century , are going to panic at that sort of inform ation. After all, they have put up with the introduction of nuclear weapons and the destruc tion of two Japanese cities 50 years ago. They take as a matter of course that we can land vehicles on Mars — land to the precise instant, forecast y ears before. So why should they panic? They are m uch m ore interested in doing the pools or the lottery . They would shrug their shoul ders and take it as a m atter of course. Any way, they don’t trust politicians, in m y experience. What I’d like to say is that there is a serious possibility that we are being visited — and have been visited for m any years — by people from outer space, from other civilizations; that it behooves us to find out who they are, where they come from , and what they want. This should be the subject of rigorous scientific investigation, and not the subject of rubbishing by tabloid newspapers. It seem s to m e that the Bentwaters incident is a classic case where an apparent intrusion into our airspace — and indeed, a landing in our country — occurred, which was witnessed by serious-m inded people in the m ilitary — responsib le people, doing a responsible job. And, Bentwaters is, in a sense, a benchm ark for how not to deal with these m atters in the future. [See the testimony of Larry Warren, MOD officia l Nick Pope, Clifford Stone, Lori Rehfeldt, and others regarding the Bentwaters landing event in the UK. I should also mention that I personally spent a couple of hours with Lord Hill-Norton, and he was very concerned about the secrecy surrounding this subject — and the fact that he had been deceived about it. Notwithstanding his five star Admiral status and his position as former head of the Ministry of Defense, he was never officially briefed on the subject. This is consistent with my experiences with President Clinton’s staff and his first Direct or of Central Intelligence (CIA Director) James Woolsey, senior members of Cong ress, very senior Pentagon officials, including the Director of Intelligence (J-2) for the Joint Ch iefs of Staff, and a sitting Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) — all of whom I have personally br iefed, and had been left out of the loop on this very important matter — or were directly denied in formation when inquiries were made. This is, of course, a dangerous situation. The secrecy itse lf is a great threat to the national — and world — security, makes a mockery of democracy and our constitutional form of government, and must be corrected by official action. SG] Testimony of Security Officer La rry Warren, United States Air Force Septem ber 2000 Larry Warren was a security officer at Bentwaters Air Force Base in the United Kingdom . He was present during an event in 1980 when an extraterrestrial vehicle landed, hovered, and interacted with Air Force personnel on base. Afterwards, the many personnel who had witnessed the events were intim idated, debriefed, and forced to sign docum ents telling a false version of the story . Warren’s testim ony is corroborated by m ultiple other m ilitary witn esses who have been identified. There are official docum ents related to this event; th ere is a photograph related to the event; and 225"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"there is phy sical landing-trace evidence. This entire event is also corroborated by Ministry of Defense official Nick Pope, and five-star Adm iral, Sea Lord, form er Ministry of Defense head Lord Hill-Norton, and Sergeant Clifford Stone. LW: Officer Larry Warren SG: Dr. Steven Greer LW: My nam e is Larry Warren. In Decem ber of 1980, I was assigned to the 81 st Tactical Fighter Wing in Suffolk, East Anglia, at the NATO Air Base Bentwaters, which is next to Woodbridge. I was a security specialist and worked with securing the nuclear arsenal we secretly housed there at that tim e. On Decem ber 11 th , 1980, m y security clearance notice, PRP, cam e through and I was approved. My clearance was a secret clearance at that tim e. The UFO incident took place near Woodbridge, which is our sister base, six miles [away ] and separated [ from Bentwaters] by a pine forest known as Rendlesham Forest. I was into my second week on the flight line, working the night shift. We had just com e off a break. The previous flight, C-flight, had a UFO encounter on Boxing Day [the first weekday after Christm as] m orning, early in the hours — two nights before m y event. A security policem an nam ed John Burroughs a nd an Airm an Parker were at the East Gate at Woodbridge. Airm an Burroughs saw what appeared to be an object in the forest at the east end of the runway , just within the trees. There were m ulti-colored lights, and he suspected m aybe an aircraft had crashed. He called in Central Secu rity Control on Bentwaters and reported what he was seeing. A shift supervisor nam ed Jim Pe nniston responded — he was a Staff Sergeant — [and] a few other personnel arrived. I wasn’t involved in this, but this is what I know of it: they pursued the phenom ena into the woods — they definitely thought there was an air crash, and started to begin those procedures... They found that it was not an aircraft, but a triangular object about six feet at the base, that rose to a nine-foot point. It was black like glass, with a great density to it. They didn’ t know if it was on a tripod or on legs of som e sort, but it had m ulti-color lights around it. I do know this — based on his own testim ony — that Sergeant Penniston and these m en did bring their side-arm s, which are 38-calibers that the law enforcem ent people carried. Sergeant Penniston drew his revolver when they encountered this object and saw clearly that it wasn’t any thing they were fam iliar with. These are all highly trained observers — as we all were at that tim e — for aircraft or unusual things. Sergeant Penniston drew his revolver and aim ed it at the object. At som e point he approached this [phenom enon] , very close to it, and observed a panel on its side with som e sort of language sim ilar to hierogl yphics. It was som ewhat fam iliar to him , but he couldn’ t identify the script. It was raised from the surface; he touched it and felt the surface — it felt warm to a degree, and [was] the texture of glass, alm ost — the consistency and hardness. They sensed there was movem ent within, through this opaque kind of glass. Sergeant Penniston heard a voice. These m en had four hours of m issing tim e [ and] their radio com munication had failed with the base. Luckily enough, som e other personnel obviously did respond to see what was happening with these people — and som e brought cam eras and snapped som e photos. [See the testimony of Sergeant Clifford Stone who confirms that film and photos were taken of these events and how they were handled. SG] 226"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"These m en were debriefed the next m orning. Th ey were retrieved, dazed, [from ] the forest; they m ade statem ents im mediately . They were given injections of what they were told was sodium -pentathol by som e elem ent of the Air Force. Airm an Burroughs told m e directly that he knew within the next two day s that this phenom enon was going to return — and it indeed did. Their shift had ended that day ; m y shift cam e on. There was evidence left by this encounter — pod indentations on the ground. The British Suffolk Constabulary responded to this the next morning, because it was an incident. It was reported to them from the Base Security Police Op erations desk. Col. Charles Halt can explain this very accurately , because he was present on-site for the investigation. These pods were in a perfect nine-foot separation, form ing a triangle. It represented som ething [weighing] two and one-half metric tons sitting down on the ground. Th ere was a break in the canopy of the Corsican pines where som ething clearly cam e through it. There were background radiation readings taken, and Nick Pope can actually offer som e m ore inform ation on this via the Ministry of Defense. [See the important testimony of British MOD o fficial Nick Pope which confirms this event and the radiation readings which were taken. SG] The readings were 25 tim es higher than the norm al natural background radiation in that area. How these readings cam e up, is that Sergeant Ne vels, who was the disaster preparedness m an at the base at the tim e, had the Geiger counters a nd knew how to read them . These readings were taken from this ground-zero area — there was residual radiation on the trees and every thing. I was put on a very rem ote post at the end of the RAF Bentwaters flight line, called Perim eter Post 18; it was an alert-m an position. I went to m y position. It was uneventful for about an hour and one-half. What I noticed first, was an anim al disturbance where som e deer ran down to a rather low fence we had at that tim e surrounding the base. This herd of deer jum ped the fence and ran past m y position, right over the runway . They seem ed spooked, or I had that feeling. Suddenly , I started to hear chatter on the open fre quencies. We had Motorola radios at that tim e. We had four channels of security police a nd operational active channels. I started to hear com mentary about lights over the forest toward Woodbridge: “Those lights are back again,” and I was looking up. Suddenly , at this point I [ got] a call from Lieutenant Bruce Englund, who is a security police officer. He was the shift com mande r at that tim e, and said, “Warren, deactivate your post. You are going to be picked up by a GOV,” which is governm ent-operated vehicle. A truck pulled up and Sergeant Bustinza, who [ was] m y reporting officer, was the driver. Lieutenant Englund was in the passenger seat, a nd there were other personnel — new personnel like m e — in the back. I was told to get in. We went im mediately to the Bentwaters m otor pool. There was a lot of chatter about people try ing to find the Base CO [Com manding Officer] , and they were say ing, “Change frequencies, put all the radios down.” All of this, I m ust tell y ou, was recorded in CSC on the tapes they m ade of that night. Those were stolen, and so were the logs of that period — [Col.] Charles Halt can confirm this, also. They cam e up m issing in a few day s when he went looking — that list of personnel on duty and a lot of different things: incident reports and every thing. They were gone... We had our NATO rounds in the weaponry , which is very unusual, and there was an urgency am ong senior people. We went down a logging trail into the forest, and there was an arm ored vehicle after [ we got] about a half a mile into the woods. I haven’t talked about this in a while, because I wrote it and thought I’ d never have to... The feeling in the forest was very strange. 227"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"Movem ent was odd. Perception was odd the m inute we entered the forest. I will tell you this — there was a problem . Som ething was wrong. We pulled up. There were som e other vehicles. They took our weapons off us. We broke up into four m an units and headed down a trail into the forest. [Col.] Charles Halt was out there that night with a sm aller party of senior people. Lieutenant Englund joined them at one point. There was a lot of radio contact, but we had to maintain radio silence — the lower ranking guy s. But, I could hear on other open channels [ the others] say ing, “You guy s com ing in have to avoi d those hotspots. We don’t want y ou walking all over them .” I think they had anticipated these objects returning. Sergeant Burroughs, by the way — from the first night — knew it was com ing back, and arrived at the field, off-duty , in civilian cloth es, obsessed to get back near the [ phenom enon] . You can hear on the actual tape [ Col.] Charles Halt m ade that night: one of the people on the perim eter securing an access to the forest, calling [Col.] Charles Halt on the radio, say ing, “Airm an Burroughs and two other individuals wish to rendezvous at y our location.” And [Col.] Charles Halt responds, “Tell them negative at this tim e; we’ll tell them when they can com e out here. We don’t want any one out here right now.” This tape y ou will have, and [ it] should be heard by all interested parties. What I saw — I wish it was m uch sim pler than what it was. As we moved through this forest in this sm all group, I was with Sergeant Bustinza; Robert Ball was there, shift supervisor, and a lot of other people. We cam e to a clearing called Capel Green at the end of the Corsican pines, and there was a phenom enon on the ground in this field: it was like a m ist; it looked like a fog on the ground. There was a cinem atic film cam era — a m ovie cam era — present, and there was a very large video cam era there — they were very large at that tim e. These cam e from public affairs on Bentwaters. There was anticipation of the return of the [ phenom enon] . There is a trail on this film , which has been established; this isn’ t just m e talking. Any thing I’m telling y ou can pretty m uch be backed up in any court of law — especially with the body of the evidence, and I’m willing to do that. I was observing this — it was like watching a m ovie. This m ist was on the ground and it was being observed. There was disaster preparedness present. There was a house off to the left, a farm er’s house. I had never been out in this for est before. There was a light on in this house, so those people were hom e. There was a dog barking, I rem ember clearly . I saw a light com e in. We could see the beam of the Orford Lighthouse in this clearing, by the way — very clearly . This case has been written off as a m isidentifica tion of this lighthouse — an exaggeration, or whatever. In reality , it has been there for ove r 100 y ears and was no surprise to any one. This object, a red basketball-shaped object, cam e in fro m the North Sea area over the trees. I thought it was a taillight on an aircraft, but it m oved so qui ckly . The m ist on the ground appeared to have structure, and it was 50 feet across. This b asketball-sized am ber light didn’ t seem solid — I couldn’t tell y ou what it was — but it was 20 feet above the object, this m ist. As soon as I got a fix on that and every one else did, the cam eras were upon it — these people were reacting. Then there was an explosion — it’ s very hard for m e to describe it: this thing broke up into m ultiple shards of extrem ely bright light! I, and others, suffered burns to the ey es — I have docum ents of this, because I stole them from Bentwaters when an officer advised m e to . He said, “Your m ilitary record is going to vaporize as soon as y ou are gone.” So m y ey es were dam aged — flash burns to the retinas and all. This is established m edically — it was as if I’d stared at an arc welder’s torch for about 10 minutes, which is unadvisable. Every thing was very bizarre at that point. 228"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"This explosion of light was very silent, and where the explosion of light happened, there appeared a structured, solid object, rather large — probably 30 feet at the base, to a py ram id-ty pe shape. It was very rough — it would distort if you looked at it, with a rainbow-like effect. And yet, through peripheral vision, you could get a clear fix. I will tell y ou, there is real evidence for this thing — where it sat — to this day . This one won’ t let any one down — this case — believe me ! This thing was there, on the ground — and it was film ed, and it was photographed. There were som e British bobbies present on Charles Halt’ s tape. You hear the Suffolk Constabulary pull up in the forest, with their Br itish police vehicle, because their siren was on for a bit. These police are unattainable — they won’ t talk to any one. They had a cam era, and one was taken off of the British police. Already , an international incident was brewing here. Our Wing Com mander, Gordon William s — who was at a party , I believe, that night — arrived on-site with other senior people. There were British m ilitary present. They could have been at the party . And, I will say , they seem ed to know how to deal with an event like this. I have no recollection of any sound em itting from this object. It was alm ost like a mirage, and y et, I know it was solid because it left traces and evidence and all, but it was so bey ond any thing I have ever seen, and it [was] right in front of us. I was only 30 feet away from it at one point — too close. There was a life form in association with it — so I can just cut to the chase: I rem ember thinking, what are these children doing here? And the m ind starts scram bling. There was a bright light, and there was m ovem ent. These things had an upper body , I clearly saw, and when I saw an arm m ove — m y, y ou know — y ou just, y ou are in another place at that point. And, these senior people were very close to that [ phenom enon] . What I saw was on the right side of this bizarre m achine: this bright light moved out, and it was bluish-gold and about a foot off the ground. It split — it was only about four feet in height from the ground up, but it split away — and three individual, oblong cocoons of light with these three individual people in [ them ], were there. SG: But they looked like hum ans? LW: They were hum anoid. Yeah. SG: Do y ou know the height of them ? LW: Yeah, they would have been about, in height , four feet. I m ean, y ou think of children. The light dim inished, and that’ s when y ou could see what was in it. They were hairless, but there was clothing. There was an apparatus attached — I can’ t describe — a dark thing. I could not see the lower extrem ities because of the light — these were not walking on the ground — these things. And, I wish I never saw this, but there was a white m embrane around what are large eyes — and the white m embrane was m oving, adapting. It was like y our ey es adjusting to light. The Com mander was there — and this is where I swear there’ s got to be a protocol, in the event of som ething like this. He moved forward, and at that point we were called out of the area by rank. In fact, a lot of lower-ranking people were involved in this, and [ were] sent back to the vehicles. On our way back, there was a lot of phenom ena in the forest. These light beings, or whatever, were there; and there were other craft around, above the trees, alm ost as if they were 229"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"guarding this thing and backing it up. I will tell y ou that Airm an Burroughs was in the parking area where all the vehicles were. They would not let him out to the sites. Charles Halt was pursuing other light phenom ena and had beam s fired down to the ground right in front of him — literally — pencil-sized beam s from these crescent-like objects. Col. Halt was m aking a tape recording as it all happened — four hours of audio; y ou’ve got 18 m inutes of dy nam ite! My event was happening about a half a m ile away . In fact, on that tape, you hear the beginning of my event. I will clarify this: I was on the record long before the whole tape becam e public, and I was the one that m ade the whole tape go public. I turned it over to CNN — and I’ve never taken a penny for any thing I’ve done with this, ever. I never have. As we left, Airm an Burroughs told m e another object appeared — right in the midst of a lot of security personnel at the parking area where all the trucks [ were] . It appeared right in the midst of them . Airm an Burroughs grabbed this object, and it m oved over the ground — ten meters — with him holding onto it! It’s an absolu te fact: he phy sically touched it! He m oved with this thing on it. It took off. It got away from John...Another beam of light cam e down. There was one guy , a part of the security personnel, in a pick-up truck. This thing was following him — one of these beings and the light — literally following him . He jum ped into the pick-up truck, slam med the door, and it passed through the glass right in front of him , and he freaked and kicked the windscreen right out of the truck! This thing went out the other window. I know this person — this was happening in front of m any people too! It went out the other window, which was rolled-up because it’ s Decem ber. As he turned away from the vehicle, a blue beam of light cam e down from above the trees, and this thing got on it and ran right up into som ething that was dark and looked like a pinecone with white pins of light on it. It was dark against the night sky , and was watching over this event. Another Offi cer has said that he felt that these objects had been there looking for som ething. They were conducting grid searches the night before. There were three nights of activity . They were there for a reason, and it was kind of like, okay , we are here for a purpose; you guy s are bothering us, so we are going to show y ou what y ou need to know — but we are going to accom plish what we need to do. I will tell you that [Col.] Charles Halt said to m e later, “Were y ou aware that on that night, there were three massive triangular objects over the base, over the forest, and over the Woodbridge base the whole tim e?” And there was m issing tim e with so m any personnel over this period — it was am azing. Afterwards, I noticed I had a shock of gray hair that did fall out — literally , a shock of gray hair on the right side. My ey es were watering prof usely . I had a m etallic taste in my mouth, and I was sweating profusely , and had cold chills. I decided: I’m going to go call m y m other, but we had secured phones on the base, obviously . Being rather y oung and naïve, I didn’t pay attention to the COMSEC rules: com munication security . We had a phone where I knew they ’d alwa ys listened in on y our calls, so I went to a public phone box (when they used to have them here on the base) and reversed the charges to my Mom . I said, Mom , you won’ t believe this. I said, last night a UFO landed on the base, and we saw every thing, and y ou wouldn’t believe it! A nd, I’m just thinking, she’s not responding: Mom ? Mom ? She’s gone. I looked at Greg [ a friend with m e] and I go, oh m y God, I got cut- off! I called the operator, and I said, listen, can you reconnect m e? She goes, “Are y ou calling 230"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"from the base? ” I go, y eah. She goes, “I’ m sorry , y ou were cut off from the base,” and then she hung up on m e. I looked at Greg, and said, m an, I think I’m in trouble. So, we ran back to my dorm . [Before I called m y m other] we were called to the office. Malcolm Zickler, a Major, was the Chief of Security Police, and his underling Majo r Carl Drury — all were involved in one aspect or another with these events. There was a Jaguar outside the office, and there was another expensive car — I don’t rem ember what it was now. I thought, oh, here we go — the debriefing. Well, first of all, there were all the lower-ranki ng guy s. There were no people above sergeant in my group. We were debriefed in a com partm entalized way , which I understand now, but then I didn’t. And, I said, oh m y God, they are going to tell us to shut-up; I know it! I’ll nam e nam es. There were people in plain clothes going in and out of the security police law enforcem ent desk, and that was unusual. And, I’m like, oh boy ! They said, “Did any of you retrieve or rem ove any thing from the forest while y ou were in there? Any thing — a rock, twig, any thing? ” They kept asking us over and over. And, they said, “If y ou have, and are not going to tell us now, you are subject to the UCMJ,” all these rules: Article XV, bey ond that, JL-11, every thing. We were young; we were all new — we were like, oh my God, we haven’t even started here, and we are in trouble. We were gone over with a Geiger counter, and there was one return on one of the guy s, and som ething was taken out of his pocket. This guy was rem oved very quickly , and I will swear on m y life — I never saw him again! He was rem oved. This happened to a lot of people. It led to a suicide that the Air Force is responsible for — this is a real person with a real nam e. That base, by the way , after that, eventually had the highest rate of suicide in NATO — this is an established fact. One of the Captains involved was found hanging in his back garden from a tree — married, with children — every thing. All these people started to shoot and kill them selves. I’ ve lived it — and I’ m am azed I got out of there alive. So, we were brought into the office. There were rows of seats, a very sm all law enforcem ent desk. The law enforcem ent operators that day were kept out of the office. Every thing was different on that base now. We were brought in and there were sheets on top of the law enforcem ent desk. There were about 10 of us, and there were one, two, three, four, five, six, seven stacks of docum ents — pre-ty ped. One was a pre-ty ped statem ent, all generic, of what we saw — which was not what we saw. It said we were off-duty and saw only unknown lights flipping am ongst the trees. I clearly rem ember that. I said, what if we don’ t sign this, Major Zickler? And, he [said] , “You have no choice.” And he [ said] , “I have no choice but to ask y ou to do this.” I kept seeing these other personnel in his office, because we were heading there next. He [told us to] sign — I think there were four — docum ents. One was the UCMJ secrecy thing — I forget, JANAP-1-som ething — and that clearly said, JANAP. But, there were other things that we couldn’ t read. They said, “You’ ll be able to read them later; put your signature on; social security num ber.” Then we were filed into his office. There was a m ovie screen set-up. There were two rows of chairs, metal chairs, folded out. Major Zickler left, and there were two gentlem en in civilian clothes — big people, very business-looking: Am erican. They had a plastic ID with a photo and it said Arm ed Forces Security Services. I don’ t know if that’ s Air Force — we have been told that is a field arm of the National Security Agency . They were intim idating people. [See the testimony of Merle Shane McDow and ot hers regarding this pattern of intimidating debriefing protocols. SG] They didn’t sm ile or any thing. We were in uni form — they asked us specifically to wear the uniform s we were wearing in the field. I think that was for the Geiger counter thing. 231"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"So we sat down, and a Naval Com mander from the U.S. Navy ONI [Office of Naval Intelligence] in London, nam ed Com mander Richardson, was there. He had the reins. He was in uniform and was very affable with us. Basically , it went like this: I am sitting next to a friend of mine from Alabam a, who we called Alabam a. Alabam a was religious — at this point, he was so unwrapped...He had a handheld Bible and was reading it. He was gone. And be ing so y oung, at 19, the hum an condition isn’t apparent to a lot of people — people’s pain a nd traum a — but I was watching this guy I knew melting down — next to m e. He is one guy that didn’t m ake it — and he is a nam e, and he had a fam ily , and every thing. They didn’t care about that. But what Com mander Richardson did say is that — we were all num b, but this is very clear — in a nutshell, “You airm en have been exposed to som ething that we have known about for longer than any one of y ou in this room are aw are of.” And it was all m atter-of-fact. He said, “There is a phenom enon that has been com ing here for m any , m any years. Som e of it com es and goes; som e of it is a perm anent presence.” They didn’ t say a phenom enon, they said various civilizations — advanced civilizations. And, ther e was a lot of talk about the reasons for secrecy — national security . He said, “You’ re best to go on with y our lives.” One of the guy s in the room said, “What if we say som ething?” And he goes, “Know this now — y our m ail and phones will be monitored for as long as you are in the m ilitary .” He said, “The best way to go about it is not discussing this with any one, even each other, from this point on. Go about y our lives; forget about all this. Move on with y our lives, with the knowing that y ou have seen som ething that few people will ever get to see.” Every other word was loy alty to national security , our oath, serving the country — it was brainwashing, because all- of-a-sudden it was repetitive lines, and there was a drone to his voice. Then they showed a film . They said, “We are going to show y ou a film that m ight help y ou best put into perspective what y ou gentlem en have witnessed, and help y ou, m aybe, put it to bed a little bit for yourselves.” We were also told, though, if any of us [ had] any unusual dream s, there’s a num ber we were to call, daily , for the next m onth. If any one was try ing to pry inform ation out of us we were to let [ the au thorities] know. They said that there would be a possibility of Soviet infiltration of the area — to try to get inform ation from us. At that tim e, it was the Cold War, and they said [to] be aware of any thing; we were to report that im mediately . They ran the film — I m ean, it was just a film on a reel — it was not narrated; he did not narrate it. It began with gun cam era footage [ from ] what I can only assum e [was] m aybe the 1940s. It showed som e propeller-driven aircraft in broad day light. It looked like the Florida Key s, and a fleet of silver discs [ went] under the aircraft. That was one of the first fram es. [ The] clip [changed] . This thing went all the way up to the space program . The best clip on it showed the berets of the 5 th Special Forces in Vietnam on a red clay hill [with] low scrub brush and a guy with a cam era...I don’t even know the y ear, but it w as in color. He turns the cam era and this giant, green, delta-shaped thing rises out of the br ush, very slowly and deliberately , below where they are, up to face level, cam era level, and th en continues — but, shrubbery and brush is falling off this m assive thing, and a flock of big pelicans [ or other] birds goes right under it — I’ll never forget that in m y life! I rem ember that better than the incident in the field. The space program : I swear to God, this film showed structures on the m oon — these box kind of things — that looked sand-colored. [See the important corroborating testimony of these structures by Karl Wolf. SG] 232"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"It showed that lunar car m oving around. I rem ember those clearly , because I rem ember being a child when all that was happening. Then — at a distance — the astronauts pointing at these box-looking things, and structured objects m oving off the surface of the m oon — film ed by Apollo m issions. SG: What did the structures on the m oon look like? What shape were they ? LW: The structures looked like a continuation of the color of the m oon, but there was structure to it. Like, huge box-kinds of things — very square and angular structures without windows. But they were artificial, clearly , and, they were being film ed; and then, there were lights and weird things on top of hills. SG: Are they in good condition or old? LW: Oh, no — they looked pristine. SG: And were the UFOs m oving? LW: Very clearly , in different scenes. A lot of it was with the lunar car — that m ission.

The Apollo m ission is the era where it ended. So, after this m eeting, and calling m y m other and getting cut-off, I knew I was in trouble. I was called to the com munications section of Bent waters. I knew what was com ing. A Staff Sergeant was there, and the Captain debriefed m e. I was asked questions. There was a reel-to- reel tape m achine present in the debriefing, a nd they kept asking m e, “Have y ou given sensitive inform ation out over land lines?” Over, and over. And, I said, no, no.

And they play ed the tape — here’s m e, ‘Hi Mom , you’ll ne ver believe...’ They said, “Wa rren, y ou have to understand, every phone on this base is m onitored all the tim e an yway.” I was told that I was not given an Article XV because that is traceable. I would be fined $300.00, and if I caused any m ore trouble, I’d lose m y stripes. There is a paper trail on that fine, and no explanation. Later, I was threatened with the IRS and every thing. Madness. They are crazy . The m achine is crazy . Later, we were eating, and Sergeant Penniston was sitting right there. Som eone asked me, “What the hell happened to us last night?” And, Sergeant Penniston, who was senior, he goes, “Shut the fuck up, Warren, shut the fuck up.” Ju st like that. I was like this: oh m y God, and I threw m y tray down and just walked out. It was all downhill from there, m y friend. Later that night, Sergeant Bustinza, m yself — and I swear it happened to others — received a phone call to meet a vehicle in the parking lot. Se rgeant Bustinza and I were to m eet this vehicle at 5:00 p.m . that afternoon. It was dark at that point in England. We both walked up. I said, hi, Busty , how y ou doing? He goes, “All right.” A nd, we both walked toward this vehicle. The door was open. There was a guy sitting there. In reality , what happened is, two people cam e up behind each of us — and I do rem ember som eone heading towards him — and I heard the sound of what sounded like an aerosol, and I went black. My conscious m emory for y ears was that the interior lights in the car were too bright, and I just blacked out. In reality , we were hit with an aerosol of som e sort. My nose ran profusely , and m y chest got tight. I, obviously , was not getting into the car properly , so I was beaten — literally hit in the ribs and pushed. I was resisting, and I know Sergeant Bustinza was doing the sam e thing. 233"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"I had identified m yself as a problem . It turns out, y ears later, that he had m ade som e phone calls too. We were taken som ewhere on the Bentwa ters flight line. I knew this by the sound of where we went. When I was rem oved from that car, I cut m y face, because I fell out of it — obviously , being im mobile — and hit a patch of concrete and ice, and was carried, literally — bodily , face down. I rem ember my nose running so profusely , and I couldn’ t wipe it or any thing. I didn’ t know if it was bleeding or what. I know we descended. I will tell y ou there is an underground facility on that base that is — to this day — there. I have more memories of it being a very clinical situation. We do know, at this tim e, a lot of outside people were on the base. There were team s in the forest. Aircraft cam e into Woodbridge, and even the com manders of the base had no access to get near it, or ask why they were there. Team s in white coveralls were going throughout th e forest. There were Intelligence people on the base that were never there before. These are all things that can be established as fact, from many other people. [See the testimony of Sergeant Clifford Stone who was involved with this external team investigating this event. SG] Any way, I have 20 m inutes of recall, and I’m gone for a day — and, it’s established with other people. People said I was on em ergency leave, or on leave, or off the base — but I was just under the base — and there were other personnel down there. There was a lot of high tech m achinery , huge vaulted, glass-like ceilings, panels of glass walls — like a subway wall — old, but huge glass panels. We were brought to one area, and I have a conscious m emory, whether it is real or not, of looking into a very dark void, and having som eone to this side of m e explaining that ther e were tunnels from the base to the North Sea. My next conscious m emory is just broad day light — walking out into the sunshine from the base photographic lab. A lot of y ounger guy s and I went through this. I do rem ember being on a table and seeing Air Force senior people, and som e other unidentified people, talking down to me. I know I was looking up at them with bright lights. I had m arks, by the way , from an IV, or som ething, when I cam e out of there. I had the bruise and I had a bandage. I will adm it that. That’s for real. I had it. I’m terrified to know or think of what m ight have happened, so I’ve only pursued these m emories a little bit. I wrote m y Mother a letter, and I wrote the letter a week and a half before Charles Halt authored the actual Halt m emo, which was gained by the Freedom of Inform ation Act. It is a docum ent that reads like science fiction on Air For ce letterhead. It’ s a m inim izing of the event — I believe, intentional — but it reads like science fiction. It was released in 1983 through Citizens Against UFO Secrecy , based on inform ation I supplied them , after num erous denials that it existed from the Air Force itself. Pod casts were m ade of the indentations where the object landed on the first night. Charles Halt still has possession of one of them , and does show people this, and would show it to any congressional body , I think. Most of them ended up missing. Soil analy sis was done on the landing site, but it was all swept away . Years la ter, from 1988 to 1990, we did core sam ples, soil analy sis, which was analy zed by Springborn Envi ronm ental Labs in Massachusetts by accredited scientists. We have the published findings in the book Left at East Gate. An absolute [phenom enon] took place only in that spot — to a le vel of three feet down. Plants do not grow in this one spot — no m atter what crop — we’ ve talked to the farm ers — for 20 years. However, 234"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"the soil is darker. It does not absorb water. It is alm ost cry stalline, m ixed with a very dry dirt, like freeze-dried coffee. [See the testimony with Roberto Pinotti and the results from landing sites in Italy and France, which show similar changes. SG] It was, in a theoretical way , heating the soil to a degree in an industrial m icrowave oven — to a super high heat — and then dropping it, instantly , into a sub-zero freeze — in alm ost a conical direction — down. RAF Watten, a Roy al Air Force Base, had radar returns of these objects on all nights in question. RAF Watten, on the third night and the first night, picked up an object descending into the forest. The next day , the U.S. Air Force went to RAF Watten, talked to the air traffic controllers, [and] told them that an alien sp acecraft landed in Rendlesham Forest. There was contact with the base com mander, and they were borrowing the radar tapes, but the tapes were never returned. These are all real people that are apparently talking now. I also know that on one of the nights in question, a sm all object appeared near the perim eter of RAF Watten, not far from our base. Of course, they had higher security becau se of the IRA threat at that tim e. A Roy al Air Force police dog handler (K-9 team ) was doing a pe rim eter patrol, and the dogs went flat down on the ground. These people are talking now. Then they saw these two beings near the fence line — prodding it — next to a triangular object. They were prodding the fence with these light-like objects. When they saw the RAF dog handlers, they fled toward this m achine that took off and headed off toward our base. When people ask about the film and photographs, there is confirm ation — this isn’t a story I cam e up with. Captain Mike Verrano verifies on the Cable News Network program , UFO: the Bentwaters Incident, from 1985, that indeed he drove the wing com mander Gordon William s, the next m orning, to an awaiting jet. The pilot ope ned the canopy , and he said, “What do y ou have in that satchel?” And he said, “I have actual f ilm . We have actual film and photographs of the UFO.” So, Gordon William s personally handed this m aterial, in a satchel, to the pilot, Mike Verrano [said] . I, by the way , asked where the film was going, and I was told Germ any . That was Air Force com mand at that tim e. From there, we know that there was a paper trail, and that it was eventually sent back to Washington. I was an honorably discharged security policem an. I have an honorable discharge. I’ve heard a lot of nasty things said about m e, but I have m y records. The only reason I have my records is because I was advised to steal som e of them — by an Air Force Colonel — because he said they would vaporize y ou. He said, “They are going to fireproof y ou.” [See the testimony of Brigadier General St ephen Lovekin regarding his information about being “erased.” SG] I was looked at alm ost like a Frank Serpico kind of guy . I was not a team play er, because I was talking to every one. Unfortunately , my friend Alabam a went AWOL try ing to get back hom e. At O’Hare Airport, he was captured by the FBI and returned to duty im mediately . All he wanted to do was go hom e, but he was put back on flight duty . I was riding with the senior master sergeant on vehicle patrol, just totally depressed with every thing, when Alab am a called in — this is a real person — and said he was going to kill him self if he couldn’t go hom e. And, this guy turned the pick-up truck quick, and was heading toward the post. He said, “You stay on the Goddam n radio...” I saw all the units 235"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"across the flight line responding and every thing. I never hear Mr. Halt com ment on this at all, and that’ s why he won’ t stand with m e in a place — because I bring up things that m aybe they feel bad about. As he say s, the Air Force [ was] on the sidelines for it all. Any way, Alabam a had a short M16, and he put it in his m outh and took the top of his head off. This was the first tim e I ever saw death — violent death — at 19. We were as different as night and day , m e and this kid. You know — he was the south; I was the north. He was very religious. I respect that, but we had nothing in com mon. He was a nice guy . And, they did not do any thing to help us... I have had unbelievable phone problem s for y ears — the ty pical things — [ and] my mail is still intercepted. In this country [the UK] , it was, for y ears, opened and resealed in plastic, with a letter of apology . Many of our packages don’t get where they are going. [I can verify this, as we have had great d ifficulty getting follow-up materials from Mr. Warren out of the UK. SG] Later, m y passport was com ing up for renewal, a nd I sent it in. It would have expired by the tim e I was going on a trip. But soon after sending it in for a new one, I got a letter back say ing, “Mr. Warren, y our passport was altered or m utilate d and y ou need to reapply for another one.” I said, oh my God, what the hell was that? So, I just, I said, oh fine, [ and] filled it out. Next response: “Mr. Warren, y ou m ust reestablish U.S. citizenship.” I’ m like, what? I’ m calling all these people. Finally , in Portsm outh, New Ham pshire, at the National Passport Center, this wom an said, “I can’t tell y ou what’s happening here .” After a while, I said, listen, I’m writing a book called Left at East Gate, and she goes, “The Bentwaters thing...” She said, “Call m e at this num ber” — it was her hom e num ber in Lebanon, New Ham pshire. I called her, and she said to me, “I have the official printout: ‘This i ndividual’s passport is being revoked under som e classification, due to his speaking of sensitive de fense issues at a public forum on foreign soil,’ and then som e coding, DOD coding, under it.” I have it all, and it is just bizarre. Our agent at that tim e, Perry Knowlton in New York City , was friends with Ram sey Clark, the form er U.S. Attorney General. He set up a m eeting with us, and I met with Mr. Clark in person. He said to m e, “I’m going to m ake som e phone calls for y ou,” but he say s, “I’m going to tell you this — after knowing every thing — they say it was because y ou talked about nuclear weapons, that’s all.” Mr. Clark said, “People in England suspected there were nukes there all the tim e. I will tell y ou this: y our passport was susp ended because of the other things y ou’ ve talked about,” and he wouldn’t elaborate any m ore. He made two phone calls, and the Departm ent of State, with apologies, said it was an error. So, we’ve tried to do our best. I’d be willing to speak and swear to this in front of any congressional body . I have great respect for m y country , and I think it is the people’ s right to know. [We have identified the names of numerous witnesses who should testify before Congress regarding these landing events. This case alone establishes the reality of the UFO and extraterrestrial issue.

Testimony of Sergeant Clifford Stone, United States Army Septem ber 2000 Sergeant Stone tells an am azing story about the history of UFO’s and extraterrestrials dating back to the early 40’s and proba bly before. General Douglas MacArthur organized a group called the Interplanetary Phenom ena Research Unit back in 1943 to study this issue and it continues to this day . Their purpose is to recover objects of unknown origin particularly those that are of non-Earthly origin. They obtain field intelligence inform ation and pass it on to those who are the “keepers of this inform ation.” Stone say s that even Project Bluebook had an elite investigation unit, which was outside of Bluebook. This unit was thought to be working in conjunction with Bluebook but in fact was not. Stone has seen living and dead extraterrestrials in his official duties on an arm y team that retr ieved crashed ET crafts. He thinks that the extraterrestrials will not perm it us to explore the depths of outer space until we’ ve learned to grow spiritually and that they will m ake them selves known soon if we don’t first acknowledge their presence. On February 26 th , 1942, com monly called the Battle of Los Angeles, we find that there are som e 15 to 20 unidentified craft fly ing over Los Angeles. We im mediately responded by try ing to shoot these objects down. The 37 th Coastal Artillery Group expended 1,430 rounds. We im mediately set out to try to find out if there was som e hidden base belonging to the Axis from where these planes could com e, som e com mercial air port that they could have had these aircraft housed. None of this bore out. Every search e ffort we m ade turned out to be fruitless. 238"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"At the sam e tim e in the Pacific they were experiencing the sam e phenom ena, the so-called Foo Fighters. General MacArthur directed his intelligence people to find out what was going on. I have reason to believe that in 1943 MacArthur found out that in fact we had things not of this Earth and visitors from som e other planet visiting our planet that was actually observing that world event we call the Second World War. One of the problem s that he had was that, should this be the case, and should they prove to be hostile, we knew very little about them and we had very little m eans to defend ourselves. MacArthur organized what was called the In terplanetary Phenom ena Research Unit. [See the testimony of Buck Sergeant Leonard P retko regarding M acArthur’s involvement in the ET issue and his knowledge of the retrieved s pacecraft and ET’s from the New Mexico Crash. SG] It would later be taken over by General Marshall. And it c ontinued all the way through to present day . Nam es have been changed and reco rds still haven’ t surfaced. The Arm y tries to state that it was not an official organization e ffort to try to investigate UFO’s. But it was organized by a General, it bore a fruit, it cam e to conclusions that were not popular, i.e., interplanetary spacecraft. And they continued to do exactly what they do today and that is to be part of a m ulti-intelligence operation in the rec overy of objects of unknown origin particularly those that are of non-Earthly origin. Their pur pose is to assess that inform ation, get raw field intelligence data, and process that data into som e type of useful intelligence product to dissem inate to the field - to those people who have a need to know and those people that are, shall we say , the keepers of that inform ation. One of MacArthur’ s Air Force generals, an Ar my Air Corps General at the tim e, cam e back to MacArthur and told MacArthur “what we have is som ething not of this Earth”. I would suggest that by this tim e even the Germ ans had uncovered evidence that we were being visited and had som e ty pe of phy sical evidence. MacArthur definitely had phy sical evidence. From the docum entation I saw [while working this issue in the Arm y], I was not able to ascertain exactly what that phy sical evidence consisted of but it was there. The one thing I find quite unique is that the Ge rm ans m ay have tried to back-engineer one of these objects. We definitely tried to back-engineer it. But we find that y our technology has to be on par with the acquired technology in order to back-engineer it... In the 1950’s, the United States Air Force had an elite unit to investigate UFO’s outside of Bluebook. Even though Bluebook felt that this unit was working with them , they were not. This unit was initially organized as a 4602 nd Air Intelligence Service Squadron. Am ong its peacetim e missions was operation Blue Fly . Operation Bl ue Fly was to recover objects of unknown origin that fell to Earth. It is very im portant that y ou rem ember these were specifically objects that fell to Earth- because we didn’ t have any spacecraft up ther e at this tim e. As a result of this, they had monitors right there at Wright Patterson that when UFO reports cam e in they were looked at very closely to see if there was any possible necessity of sending out team s to recover any of this fallen debris. The Air Force states they never used them . I’m telling y ou I know they did. But the intent of the Operation Blue Fly peacetim e project was to go out and recover objects of unknown origin that im pacted with the Earth. Later it woul d be expanded in 1957 to cover all objects of unknown origin meaning spacecraft too. And it would becom e part of what they would call in the October of 1957 tim efram e, Project Moon Dust. 239"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"Project Moon Dust is the overall field exploitati on to recover only two item s: First, objects of non-U.S. origin that survives re-entry into the Ea rth’s atm osphere and im pacts with the Earth and objects. Naturally , we would be interested in those item s from a technical, scientific intelligence basis to determ ine, or try to ascertain the technical capabilities of any potential enem y since our known enem y of the U.S., the USSR at that tim e that was launching space vehicles into space. The other area of interest was objects of unknown origin. Now we find that there were quite a few objects of unknown origin that did not correlate with any known space launches, im pact tim es, or any known space debris falling back to Earth. In short, under [ Project] Moon Dust and under Blue Fly , we have recovered a lien debris not of this Earth. The degree of classification that we have now has changed over the y ears. Back during the tim e of the Second World War all the way up to, say 1969, you may have had as many as 11 classifications. Now there are three: confidential, secret and top secret. However, if you have inform ation that is highly sensitive that requires protection above and bey ond the norm of what is provided for those classifications, that’ s when y ou have the Special Access Program s. You do not get that ty pe of inform ation out into pub lic dom ain unless it is officially sanctioned. During the discussion of UFO’s, the questi on ultim ately is going to com e up can any governm ent keep secrets let alone the U.S. Governm ent? And the answer to that is unequivocally yes. But one of the greatest weapons the inte lligence com munity has at their disposal is a predisposition by the Am erican people, the Am erican politicians, and the debunkers- people who wish to try to debunk UFO inform ation. They im mediately com e out and say oh we can’t keep secrets, we can’ t keep secrets. Well, the truth is, y es we can. The National Recognizance Office rem ained secret for m any , m any y ears. The m ere existence of the NSA rem ained secret. The deve lopm ent of the atom ic weapon rem ained secret until once y ou exploded one y ou eventually had to tell som e people what was going on. And we are conditioned by our own paradigm s not to accept the possibility or probability of a highly advanced intelligent civilization com ing here to vis it us. You have evidence in the form of highly credible reports of objects being seen, of the entities inside these objects being seen. Yet, we look for a prosaic explanation and we throw out the b its and pieces of the evidence that doesn’ t m eet our paradigm . So it is a self-keeping secret. You can conceal it in plain sight. It is political suicide to go and start hitting up intelligence agencies to get this inform ation released. So m ost of your members of Congress, and I know I’ ve worked with a lot of them along that line, will balk and try not to do it. I can nam e you three m embers of Congress that were point blank asked to have a congressional inquiry on what happened here at Roswell. One of the m ost ridiculous statem ents that I got was that a person would have to be a chairperson to do that. So I asked a senator from Mississippi if he’d do it and without any hesitation, he said no. I said, would y ou give m e that in writing? I got that in writing but I’m hesitant to release it. I will show it to you but I’m hesitant to release it sim ply because I m ade a prom ise not to. We have got to get the docum entation as it exists in the Governm ent files. We have got to get it released before it ultim ately is destroy ed. A good exam ple is the Blue Fly and Moon Dust files. I had classified docum ents the Air Force acknowledged. When I got m embers of Congress to help m e open up m ore files they were im mediately destroy ed and I can prove this. Som ewhere along the line they m ay see that m ateri al and realize there is som e very highly sensitive inform ation that would have a dam ning effect upon the national security of United 240"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"States should it becom e com prom ised. It needs to be further protected to insure that there is only a lim ited access to that inform ation to a sm all num ber of people. So sm all y ou can put them on a list of paper, on a piece of paper, and list them by nam e. Thus y ou have the Special Access Program s. The controls that were supposed to be put on the Special Access Program s are not there. When Congress did their review of the way we protect docum ents and the way we go ahead and im plem ent our secrecy program s they found that y ou had Special Access Program s within Special Access Program s -- that it was essentia lly im possible to keep control of them all by Congress. And I’ m telling y ou right now; it is essentially im possible to keep control of them all. When it com es to UFO’ s the sam e criteria applies. Therefore, only a sm all nucleus within the intelligence com munity num bering less than a hundred -- no, I’ d suggest less than 50 -- control all that inform ation. It is not subject to c ongressional review or oversight at all. So Congress needs to go ahead and ask the hard questions and convene a hearing. There would be quite a few m issions to describe but sim ply put, y es, I was involved in those types of operations to retrieve crashed ET objects. A lot of people think that y ou are just in y our unit waiting in the rafters, just waiting for the next UFO crash, a landing where there is going to be debris. It doesn’t work that way . You have a real life. You have a real job in the m ilitary . However, if y ou are in an area where an even t takes place and y ou are one of these people that they can go ahead and call upon in y our field of expertise, then y ou are called in. Now, in order to prepare m e for this, very ear ly on in m y career they sent me to NBC School at Fort McCullen [ sp], Alabam a. It’s a th ree-week school. It’s for NBC personnel, NBC meaning Nuclear, Biological, and Chem ical. And it would alway s be in the context of an NBC unit that I would be involved in UFO retrievals . You would go ahead and deploy as though it was a nuclear accident. There are procedures already established on nuclear or biological or chem ical accidents. So y ou would proceed in that way . If y ou could get in there and do recoveries, if you could go in and extract the debris that are there quietly behind the scenes and no one knows, you’ d do it. If y ou needed an officially sancti oned deception program to com e into play , such as a bogus news release, y ou could do this also. For exam ple, if y ou have an airplane accide nt we have standard procedures on how we handle that. Those sam e procedures are utilized when y ou do a recovery or extraction of a crashed ET spacecraft or debris thereof. And I have to stress debris sim ply because these are highly advanced technical m achines. There were not that m any crashes. They are flawed because they are made by an intelligence that is as m ortal as y ou or m e. Being m ortal, we are subject to error. Now, we are talking about a highly intelligent civilization, not a highly incom petent civilization. We take steps and they take steps. But at the sam e tim e, when y ou go out, y ou m ake a recovery . And when you make that recovery , y ou handle it the sam e way you would as if y ou were out there on an airplane accident or y ou ha ve a hazardous m aterial ty pe situation, because it works. It is all set up. The only problem you have is that y ou have people out there that are very quickly going to realize that this is not som ething of this planet. To be sure, with the Blue Fly recoveries [ET craft] , y ou do what is called an on-site analy sis. In short, y ou have experts out there who know wh at m issiles are, who know what aircraft are. They are looking at this m aterial. They are telling y ou what it isn’t. This leaves y ou to only one possible conclusion, som ething that did not origin ate on the face of this planet. That was the intent of the Blue Fly team s. It was very criti cal to do an im mediate on-site analy sis. Now, the 241"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"way you package the m aterial if it is just debris is handled the sam e way you would if it was hazardous m aterial. You took precautions. If you had a whole craft, y ou took very serious precautions because while I still state the ET’ s are not hostile, y ou still could cause som e serious accidents, which would result in death. I’ m not going to get into how it was with the fam ily when I had to leave on these operations because y ou get a little em otional because you think about what could happen... Of course, y ou try to conceal the m aterial, partic ularly if you have a large craft and it is disc shaped or say , wedge shape -- which is a very good shape that we get from tim e to tim e. And y ou take precautions particularly if y ou have to go ahead and put it on a truck to bring it in. If y ou have to put it on a truck to take it to a safe haven area, we track that truck. The truck has an 800 num ber so if there is a breakdown they can secure the vehicle and stay with it. But they have a num ber they can call and im mediately get assistance out there to m ove that vehicle to a safe haven area. And there are procedures outlined in this. As a m atter of fact, y ou have a shipping docum ent. And that shipping docum ent has the num ber right on it to call. So you use a code word -- I’ ll give y ou one that we used all the tim e: Tabasco. In the case of an ET craft, y ou are going to get a specialized team out there that knows what to do should there be a biological com ponent. One of the big concerns we had was biological due to contam ination as a result of this being truly of alien origin. I am prepared to state that I have been at locations where craft of unknown origin that did not originate on the face of this planet were there. I am prepared to state that while I was there, we saw living and dead bodies of entities that were not born on this planet. I am prepared to state that we had what they referred to as “interfacing” with those entities. I am prepared to state that they have a school to try to indoctrinate people. I never went to that school. I alway s refused. I am prepared to state that when I got out of the service in 1990, that they held m e for two m onths so that I m ight better reconsider to stay in and not get out. I am prepared to state that I had orders that stated that I was supposed to get out on Decem ber 1 st of 1989, and that they revoked those orders. Once again, in violation of law they held me for two m onths pending approval of m y retirem ent, which had already been approved. Th e purpose of that was to try to convince m e to stay in. We have contact with aliens not originating from som e foreign country but from som e other solar sy stem . And I have been a party to that. I’ ve worked it. I’ve been there. And I know som e of the things we do is really , really , really , really terrible. They are not hostile toward us. We are the enem y in this instance -- but we are the enem y, I like to think, for the good reasons. We are concerned about what som e other country m ight do. I have concluded that I am fighting against the clock. That I have but a short tim e to try to convince people that we are m oving down an avenue where we are going to m ilitarize space. Once we m ilitarize space we will have a whole new avenue of technology open up to us. NASA say s it is going to take another 1,400 y ears before we achieve what we call interstellar travel. I’m telling y ou by the end of this century we will be doing that. If we do nothing to grow spiritually -- and this is a hard thing for me to state -- but if we do nothing to grow spiritually we will not achieve interstellar travel. They will st op us. What’s worse they will m ake them selves known to an unsuspecting people on this planet. We want to acquire this technology . We want to m ake this technology part of our own technology . Within the next 25 y ears we are going to m ilitarize space. As a result of m ilitarizing space, we are going to acquire new technologies a nd we are going to evolve new technology that 242"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"is going to lead us into interstellar travel. As a direct result, we will becom e a threat to them unless we spiritually grow also. But I feel that if we do not grow spiritually we are forcing the situation where the entities will eventually make them selves known. And they will m ake them selves known. And no power on Earth can stop that from happening. The ET’s will do this in order to stop us from going out into space as a threat. If this should happen, it will happen to an unsuspecting world population and that can create som e very serious problem s. [See the testimony of Dr. Carol Rosin regarding Wernher Von Braun’s concern over our weaponizing space. SG] But this doesn’t deal just with the United States. It is a truth that the entire world has to be inform ed about. And that truth is that m an is not alone, that we have people from other planets, from other solar sy stem s com ing here. I believe that the intelligence com munity had good intentions when they classified inform ation dealing with UFO’s. I believe that th ey asked som e very serious and hard questions: What im pact would it have if the peoples of the world knew that they were no longer alone in the universe, that they had intelligence that was visiti ng this planet? And I think that the intentions were good there. As intelligence agencies am ong nations, naturally you want to go ahead and acquire the technology for m ilitary application. So y ou want to try to keep som e of that knowledge as confidential as possible by classify ing it as high as y ou possibly can- keeping the inform ation open to only a sm all handful of people thus, Special Access Program s. However, I believe that while it was full of good intentions in keeping this inform ation classified, it is [ now] hurting people. I do not believe that any governm ent has the right to try to m ake individuals who m erely see UFO’s look crazy . I do not believe that any governm ent has a right knowing that the psy chology of specific individuals may ultim ately lead to a trem endous am ount of m ental depression, ultim ately , leading in m any , m any cases to suicid e or self destruction. When we see these types of things com ing about, we have an obligation to reconsider our thoughts and positions. I would suggest [ that] we need to break down the walls of secrecy , that we m ust be responsible in getting the truth out. We m ust be responsible in how we get that truth out. And we m ust be truthful. And it is not a scary story . You will learn that the ET’ s have a perception of God. You find they have fam ilies. You find they have cultures. You find that they have likes and dislikes. You look for those things that are sim ilar am ong us, not the differences. And that is the way you start on the path to truth. The problem that we have right now is that we look at them as som ething to talk about; som ething to m arvel at and be am azed at. Well, back to my own story , we had just finished the training that I took to be an NBC NCO. And a friend of mine brought m e back to Fort Lee, Virginia. He was going to Fort Meade, Mary land and say s, com e on, I’ ll give y ou a ride to y our base. And we discussed UFO’ s on the way to Fort Lee. Several weeks after I got back to Fort Lee, I got a call from this person and I was going to visit him at Ft. Meade. When I got to Fort M eade where he was supposed to be, they said, well, he is going to be tied up we’ll talk to y ou later about his situation as soon as he gets free. This person say s, by the way , have y ou ever been to th e Pentagon? Well, at that tim e I had never been at the Pentagon. So they said, well, it is really a unique place. Why don’ t we go ahead and give you the twenty -five cent tour. So we went on ove r. We went in. I had a little badge that was given to m e, no picture on it. But the guy that was with m e, his had a picture and he’d just tell the 243"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"guards he is authorized to com e with m e. And he’d alway s be the one to get m e in. Finally we got to a place that has an elevator. We went down on it - I don’ t know how far down we went. I can’t tell y ou if there is one flight under the Penta gon, two, or fifty . But we went down. When we get out there, there are two m onorails there. I m ean, there are monorails under the Pentagon. They look like big tubes, rather thick in the center, one on each side. So you had these little monorails with cars that look like a bullet, wh ere y ou could seat two people in front and two people in back. We got on the one m onorail and started to go, it seem ed like m aybe 20 minutes, but I’ m guessing at that because I don’ t know for sure. When we got out, he say s, well, let m e show you som e interesting sites down this corridor here. So we are going down the corridor and it looked like there was a door at the far end of that corridor. As we got closer and closer to that door, m y guide turned to m e and stated, y ou know, things aren’ t alway s as they seem to be. He say s a lot of people don’ t know about these underground locations underneath the Pentagon. Only a few know that the Pentagon has underground m onorails that connect up to other locati ons. He say s, it is just like the walls here -- they don’ t all seem like walls. And I said, what do y ou m ean they are not walls? I said, what are you talking about? I thought, y ou know, he was try ing to m ake a joke. At that tim e he say s, no, it is like the wall behind y ou. I look and it looks like a wall to me. There are no seam s or any thing I can see. Then he pushes me. I try to grab m yself but there is actually a door that opened. Well, when y ou go through the door there is like a field table there. And behind the field table y ou had this little entity . The entity was a little bigger than the 3, 3 1/2 foot tall entities that are a lot of tim es reported. But there were two m en on either side of the table slightly behind the creature. When I turned around, I looked right into the ey es of this little creature. And y ou know, it’s like you are seeing it but every thing is being pulled from your m ind-he was reading m y whole life. It is hard to describe what I really felt there- y our life up to that point goes by in seconds. And I m ean y ou were feeling every thing. I rem ember going down and grabbing a hold of m y head like this and falling to the floor. The next thing I rem ember I wake up and I am back in m y friend’ s office [back at Fort Meade] . And when I’m back in Jack’ s office they told m e nothing happened that I had been there the whole day . But I knew better. I will go this far to state that there is an interaction between entities and certain Governm ent agencies within the U.S. Governm ent. I will not go so far to state that they are giving us technologies to kill ourselves. They are not along that line. Their purpose in being here is for scientific purposes and for hum anitarian purposes. We have been very foolish in how we have done certain things and we have harm ed ourselves. We now realize that we have harm ed ourselves and we are try ing to take corrective action. And that right there is the one thing that the ET’ s are checking on. There is the biosphere that’ s been dam aged. They are not com ing here to repair that. They are com ing here to see how we handle it. But a governm ent can’t be the one that shoulders all of the responsibility and shoulders all the knowledge and a ll the understanding. The whole situation is that we have to work in unison as a people, a united people. We m ust go ahead and start preparing ourselves to where we ultim ately will take that giant step to where we are going to be visiting other planets out there in other solar sy stem s. And we have to, once again, I’ ll use the word, grow spiritually as a group of people, the people representing mankind on plan et Earth. Yes there is som e ty pe - and I don’ t know to what extent- but there is som e ty pe of dialogue that is taking place between our visitors of all species, because there is m ore th an one, and the various governm ents- not just the 244"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"U.S. Governm ent, but of the worlds. Prim arily , these are the m ore developed nations of the world because at present space faring nations re present the greatest threat to them . Another early experience I had was an accidental viewing of som ething I was not supposed to see. We were in a facility and a friend and I went to a balcony area looking down over the briefing room . They had a Plexiglas window that separated the balcony and what was going on downstairs - y ou couldn’t hear what was being said. But we started to notice that they were running a film . And the film showed various ty pes of what we would call UFO’s, today . It showed various ty pes of alien creatures som e that looked very m uch like us som e that looked like us with m arked differences. We were not aware of the fact that there were people now up there with us. And they said, what are y ou guy s doi ng up here? And we told them , well y ou know we are just sitting up here eating our snacks because we didn’ t want to go to the snack bar. They said, you need to com e with us and y ou need to com e with us now. So I m ean they pushed us grabbing us by the nape, the shirt, and pushed us down the stairs. Once they got down the stairs, they pushed us on out the doors and into a van. The van was right there waiting, a panel van, where they pushed us in and shut the door. And then they drove us off. We don’t know where they took us to but the location where we finally got out was a one- fram e military sty le building. They took us in there, put us into this room . The room had the military cots there. It had one table with a li ght. And we were sitting back try ing to figure out why are they doing this? Why is this going on? On the fifth night, I got out and they drove me back to m y billets. I reported in and went to bed because I was dead tired and all I wanted to do was get som e sleep. The next m orning, which was a Saturday m orning, I am awakened by the CQ , that is, Charge of Quarters. And he say s, I want to see y ou. Well, I was taken to see two m en; one guy was acting like a good guy . The other guy went ahead and said, I told you we shoul dn’t trust him . Let’s just take the so and so out. Let’s just end this. Let’s shoot him . And the nicer guy say s, no, no, we’ll discuss this. And he sent the guy that was supposed to be the ba d guy out- we use that technique som etim es in security - good cop, bad cop. The one that was suppo sed to be the bad guy , he went to get som e food. The good guy say s, listen, he say s, y ou like work ing with this UFO stuff. And I’m say ing, no, I don’t. And he say s, well, y ou know, y ou have experience with it. You’ve had som e involvem ent. He say s, and those were not phony pictures up there. He say s, would you like to work with it? Would y ou like to work with us? I said, no I wouldn’t like that at all. Eventually he goes ahead and say s, look, y ou like working with, you’ll get to work with it, y ou’ll get to learn more about it, he say s. He say s the whole situation is that by the end of this y ear we are going to release every thing we know. But here again the worl d is not a safe place. We have to know m ore from a technological viewpoint and a m ilitary standpoint than potential enem ies of this country know. So I’m asking y ou -- work with us. Well, I thought about it. And y ou know, I was y oung. And I thought this is som ething that I’ve actually been involved with all m y life, that it’d be fun, that I could go ahead learn certain things, answer s to the questions I had, actually get a better understanding of events in m y life. I do believe that, one, they wanted m e in the m ilitary ; two, they wanted m e involved in this program ; three, there wasn’t really concern about, if at som e later date, I started to talk about it. They were only concerned what I m ight have to prove: If I had som e little slivers of proof, what im pact would that have on my story . But I know they did not want m e out of the m ilitary . I know they wanted m e to stay in. I know they wa nted m e to go ahead and go to what they referred 245"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"to as The School. But I would never com mit m yself to go to what they were referring to as The School. I was told that if y ou go to the school it will open up a whole new world for y ou, a whole new avenue. But I had to agree to it. And I had to go ahead and sign specific papers to go to it. And I was not prepared to go to that school. I had seen people who were involved with the program that had gone to that school and let m e just say I didn’t like their personality . I did not like the idea that by you going there it m ade y ou som ething special, it m ade y ou a prim a donna, if y ou wish. That was not the way it was supposed to be. I felt that one of the greatest things you can be is a servant and not vice versa. So som e of these people, I did not like their disposition. I did not like their attitudes. And I did not want to becom e like them . And one of m y fears was if I went to the school it would change m e the sam e way . Now, there are events, there are recoveries [of ET craft] . But the recoveries are few and far between. One of the events that took place in 1969 was a recovery of a craft that was a wedge shape craft and took place in Indian Town Gap. Now, I know it was cold and I believe it to have been in the winter but there was no snow. We were on a field training exercise, the 96 th Civil Affairs Group. I was part of the 96 th Civil Affairs Com pany . I was the NBC Non-Com missioner Officer in Charge. We were notified that they had an incident involving a downed craft and we needed to assist in recovery . The persons that showed up knew exactly where we were going and we went to our staging area. From there we went to another location in Indian Town Gap. We didn’ t have any problem s about civilians or curios ity seekers or any thing like this. The situation is, we did the recovery . I realized that what I was seeing was not of hum an origin. When we got there, there was already a team set up. Floodlights were alway s set up around the object. I was asked to get closer and closer to the object to take readings with the APD 27. As I did this, I realized what I was seeing was not of an Earthly origin. I’ m hesitant to go into it too m uch, because I don’ t want to get em otional about it... Bentwaters is another very interesting case. W ith Bentwaters, we went there to digest som e of the inform ation. As far as the phy sical ev idence, there were photographs. There was film footage. There was evidence of a higher than nor mal background radiation. Not all that high, but above norm al. We found that there were som e abnorm alities in the area we referred to as the im pact point. We also noticed that the trees had b een leveled off at the top. When we got there, it was late Decem ber, I want to say Decem ber 28 th was the day that we arrived there. [See the testimony regarding this event from Larry Warren, Nick Pope, et al. SG] We gathered up the m aterials. We took these m aterials back to Lindsey Air Force Base, all the hard evidence that we could get, all the docum entation that was there. There were sightings that were picked up on radar. Both the British Governm ent and the U.S. Governm ent were aware of these sightings. The hard evidence that we ha d was taken back to Lindsey Air Force Base. There it was digested to where there was som e ty pe of inform ation that could be put out to brief Shape Headquarters [ NATO] . And I don’t know who in Shape Headquarters was briefed. But I do know that we did have to do that. The inform ation was then put with the special courier. I believe it was com ing back to an air base clo se to the Washington, D.C. area and that the materials transferred on to Fort Belvoir, Virginia , headquarters at the tim e of the U.S. Air Forces Special Field Activities Group, Air Forces Field Activ ities Center. They then took this m aterial, did whatever they did with it, and cam e up with the finalized intelligence product. 246"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":" The reason it went to Lindsey was because the U.S. Air Forces Field Activities Center had detachm ents in the field. The closest detachm ent in the field to Bentwaters would have been Lindsey Air Force Base. They were the ones that got the m aterial. They were the ones that were charged with safeguarding it until it got back to the U.S. They were asking questions, hard questions, critical questions. They were asking t echnical questions of technical people that were involved. I know for a fact that som e of the radar operators, both British and U.S. were questioned. I know som e of the people were out there on two different nights and they were questioned. I was also involved with the Belgian UFO even ts in June, July of 1989. We were assessing inform ation, gathering data on the UFO over flight s of Belgium . The UFOs also went all over Germ any . We had one incident there on the border near the Soviet territory . We saw that the Soviets were pretty upset because this was a huge object. It was triangular shape about three football fields on either side of th e triangle. It flew over what we call No-Man’ s Zone. As it flew over there we all were getting jittery . It was, I’d say sum mer, about August. You coul d feel y our hair standing up on end. It was more than just, y ou know, getting shivers because of fright or som ething like this. There was som e ty pe of phy siological effect taking place. Once this incident subsided, we put fighters on alert. We notified them that we m ay have a Soviet craft com ing across the gap and we were going to intercept it. The Soviets did the sam e thi ng. It went back over the Soviet airspace and they scram bled fighters to try to intercept it. It w asn’t traveling fast at all. But on this particular night no one fired at it. There were pictures taken. There was consulta tion with the Soviet Union. With this going on, every one was taken in and briefed. People were inform ed that what they saw was nothing more than a Russian MIG 27 that had stray ed acr oss into the area far enough into the No-Man’s Zone to create a problem and cause som e alarm . But it was no MIG 27. We knew exactly what we were looking at. You have flashcards which ar e silhouettes of the various craft of the Soviet Union and even our own. So we knew precisely what we were looking at. What we saw was a craft that was of an unusual origin. It was not aerody nam ically sound. And when I state it was not aerody nam ically sound, I mean it had no m eans of stay ing aloft like that without som e visible m eans of aerial support like a helicopter. That wasn’t there. It was perfectly silent not m aking any noise roughly three stories high. This was one of the incidents that got me a little concerned, made me think about wanting to get out and com e back to the family , to have som e fam ily life. We had the incident escalate. We had it escalate to where the Soviet Union filed an official protest through the Belgium Governm ent to the U.S. Governm ent st ating that they were very concerned about the Belgium authorities along with several other countries letting us fly stealth aircraft on reconnaissance m issions into the Soviet Union. We notified and discussed it with the Soviet Union. We briefed at least the Soviet Military Liaison Mission Groups that this had nothing to do with our involvem ent of sending stealth aircraft into their territory . The Soviet Union was alarm ed about what was going on. They even alluded to it being our craft. They were reassured that it wasn’ t. We reassured the Belgium authorities that it wasn’ t. The Belgium authorities had their own UFO sightings. We have seen this on TV. What you don’t know about those sightings is that there w as a trem endous - I don’t want to call it a cover- up - there was a m ovem ent to keep specific inform ation about those sightings under wraps. There were som e efforts to go ahead and alter the film footage of the radar screens to the point where it 247"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"showed the UFO going underground, which it did not . I think it was supposed to have gone 600 feet into the Earth. That did not happen. It was visible. People saw it. The pilots saw it. The pilot’ s aircraft locked on to it. But these were things that would create m ore questions that we were willing to answer. So we decided to keep this out of the press. And we were successful at it. [See the government documents related to this event and the following. SG] Another case we were involved with was the Iranian incident of Septem ber 19 th , 1976. Both fighters were taken apart to try to find out if there was any way we could explain what really happened to those fighters which were having m alfunctions at the sam e tim e. There was a situation where we had som e anom alies picked up out where the sighting was- where one of the Air Force pilots saw the UFO go down to the ground. We recorded those anom alies with audio devices. We took film footage of the area and th ere were som e strange things that showed up on that film footage. Every thing that took place there at the landing area, I am not privy to. I don’ t have all the inform ation. It wasn’t som ething I had to be involved in. But I can tell y ou this much, whatever took place there had people out there for two to three weeks. In 1986, I believe it was, we fired at a UFO on two occasions. The UFO took off like nothing happened. In ‘86 y ou had the incident wher e y ou had 20 or m ore UFO’s fly ing around Brazilian aircraft, fly ing rings around them . These docum ents are im portant. Not m ore than two-dozen UFOs had been retr ieved by 1969 when I was briefed first. We were inform ed that there had only been a couple do zen tops- that there were several in the ‘40’s and the early 50’ s. And to make it perfectly clear about those events that took place then, it sounds crazy but our radar wreaked havoc on th e ET guidance sy stem s and they had to m ake adjustm ents to their guidance sy stem s for that. How m any bodies had been recovered? Don’ t know. How m any crashes have occurred in which we only got debris because the ET’ s cam e and did their recovery before we got there? Don’t know but it has happened. It has happened. When they had problem s, just like we send out a distress call, they send out a distress call, which is som ething that a lot of people don’ t think about; it’ s a question that’ s never asked. But here again we think of them as som ething intangible like that stuffed anim al there. But they are living, breathing creatures as m ortal as y ou and m e. They think, they have loves, they have likes, th ey have dislikes, they have social culture. This is so im portant to try to m ake people unders tand that that is the case. I want to put the hum an factor back into UFO’ s. And when I say the hum an factor, I m ean that these are real people. You can call them entities. You can call them creatures. But y ou som etim es find yourself wondering: who are the m ore real people, them or us? And these are things that really need to be brought out- the fact that they are just like y ou and m e. We need to seek out the sim ilarities, not the differences and com e to a greater understanding. Because eventually , in the not too distant future, we are going to have that final contact that is going to open new doors... A lot of people sit back and say , well, they don’ t have bases here. Ah, y eah, they do. We were involved in a m ajor engagem ent in 1970 in one of their bases in Vietnam approxim ately seven m iles from the Cam bodian border. If y ou want to know m ore about that, I did an audiotape on that. And I’ll m ake y ou a copy of the audiotape. I will apologize for actually try ing to hold back from som e of the stories sim ply because if I start talking about som e of the stories y ou start reliving them . And y ou don’t unde rstand, I m ean, y ou really don’t understand... 248"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"249"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"250"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"251"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"252"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"253"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"254"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"Testimony of Major-General Vasily Alexeyev March 1997 (Our deepest gratitude to Valery Uvarov for interviewing Major General Alexey ev and to Michael Hesem ann for sharing this interview.) Major-General Alexy ev, of the Space Com munica tions Center in Russia, is considered one of the m ost knowledgeable Russian Generals . He states that if extraterrestrials are capable of traversing vast distances, then they are probably from a higher level of civilization. And if this is true then they m ust be concerned with norm al developm ent of relations between people – c onstructive progress, not destructive. He say s that if we look at our Earth history , we will see a tale of self-destruction, m urder and death of entire peoples. He believes that advanced civ ilizations would not tolerate such behavior because their life would have a different m ean ing and be understood in a larger context. Major-General Alexy ev knows of m any eyew itness reports of unusual craft docum ented in specific Soviet papers. Various departm ents within the Governm ent began investigating this phenom ena including the Defense Ministry and the Academ y of Sciences. They have m any reports of UFO’ s seen over locations containing high concentrations of advanced science like nuc lear facilities. In som e cases they have learned how to create situations where they could deliberately provoke the appearance of UFO’ s, and in these ‘contacts’ for exam ple, they would point their arm s in various directions and the UFO’s would respond by flattening their spheres in the sam e direction. There was a case just outside Moscow where a warrant officer found him self at the site of a UFO landing and the extraterrestrials m ade contact with him telepathically and asked him if he would like to visit inside the craft. VA: Vasily Alexey ev VU: Valery Uvarov VA: ...The inform ation com ing in from the bases was of interest if only because it was not merely talk and rum ors; there were ey e-witnesses to phenom ena and that was reflected in specific docum ents and the reports of officials. At tim es this inform ation was of such a fascinating nature that it was im possible not to believe it. Late r the question no longer seem ed so fantastic and began to be exam ined at the level not only of the Defense Ministry , but of other governm ent departm ents as well. This interest specifically expressed itself in certain experts being sent to investigate, especially to those places where UFOs, let’ s call them that, appeared quite frequently . I know a whole num ber of m ilitary bases in that category . As a rule they are objects of strategic significance, rocket com plexes, scientific test establishm ents, in other words, there is a high concentration of advanced science and, to som e degree, danger. Because every nuclear rocket, every new air force installation represents a breakthrough both in science and m ilitary term s; it is first and forem ost a peak, the sum mit of hum an ach ievem ent. And that is where UFOs appeared fairly often. Moreover, individual officers and com manders on the spot who knew about the phenom enon and had no official instruction on the m atter, acted on their own initiative to investigate UFOs, recording data, and so on. I know that in som e places they even learned to create a situation which would deliberately provoke the appearance of a UFO. A UFO would appear where there was increased m ilitary activity connected, say , with the transportation of “special” loads. It was enough to artificially stim ulate or schedule such a m ove for a UFO to appear. In other words, som e kind of conditional relationship em erged. And they detected it. We’ re an intelligent nation; nothing escapes us. I know that at certain testing ranges – I won’ t nam e them , although it’ s no longer a secret – they even learnt to make contact of a kind. What 255"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"did that consist of? First the UFO appeared; in m ost instances it was a sphere, but there were other kinds. Contact was achieved with the help of phy sical indications of behavior – pointing your arm s in various directions, say , and the s phere becam e flattened in the sam e direction. If you raised y our arm s three tim es, the UFO flattened out in a vertical direction three tim es as well. In the early 1980s, on the instructions of the then Soviet leadership, experim ents using technical devices (theodolites, radar stations, and ot hers) were carried out as a result of which the unidentified objects were firm ly recorded as instrum ental data... Reports of UFO sightings cam e in regularly . And evidently som ewhere nearer the core of our leadership in the sphere of the Defense Mini stry , the Academ y of Sciences and so on, a lot of this kind of inform ation began to build up. And not only from ordinary lay men, but from scientists and professionals as well. Military m en in general are not inclined to fantasize. They only report what they see, what actually occurs. They are people y ou can believe. You should not forget that the arm s race was still going on at this tim e, a struggle for m ilitary and other priorities. New discoveries in science and technology were being m ade all the tim e. The UFOs were som ething new and not understood. And there really was an idea that they m ight be som e means of gathering intelligence... But it is interes ting that one of the official versions from the com mission, including am ong the final points, was the possibility that UFOs belonged to an extraterrestrial civilization! That was interesting! ... By the nature of m y work I received inform ation from various m ilitary units across Russia, the Soviet Union, as it then was. I know that that m aterial was sent on without any explanations or annotations to the relevant bodies higher up. I was aware that there were groups engaged in investigating UFOs, and perhaps som ething m ore, but at that tim e the level of secrecy over this question was such that all that took place was receiving inform ation and subsequently sending it on higher up: People cam e to see m e, but, as we we re m ilitary m en, there were no explanations of any kind. They sim ply said they were interest ed in this or that. Then they cam e up with a table with pictures of all the shapes of UFOs that had ever been recorded – about fifty – ranging from ellipses and spheres through to som ething resem bling spaceships. Witnesses were asked what it looked like, then they pinned down the loca lity and so on. After which all the m aterial was passed on. As a result, it is hard to say how the work was continued, to what extent it was scientific. I knew that som e kind of work was going on in the Defense Ministry , the Academ y of Sciences and the intelligence services. But things were such that those who weren’ t directly connected with the investigations didn’t know what was going on. We only provided the inform ation. I must adm it that there was an aw ful lot of inform ation. And here, around Moscow, above m any air-defense sites, testing-ranges and other installations – those are the places where UFOs appear m ost often... It is a global issue, a geopolitical one. I am sure that the Am ericans and other countries have built up a large quantity of this kind of inform ation. I am certain today that there is a great deal of this inform ation. And any way, this issue, like therm onuclear weapons, is a global one. It is a question of the survival of hum anity , cons idering how poor our conceptions about the environm ent and energy resources are, the ecological problem s that are em erging. We burn up the oxy gen and do a lot of other things, and in the last resort it is hard to say where we will end up and to what extent these processes are irreversible . A way out has to be found; there must be som e kind of breakthrough. With those problem s in m ind, the study of UFOs m ay reveal som e new form s of energy to us, or at least bring us closer to a solution. Therefore, questions bound up with the UFOs and all the accom pany ing phenom ena are, I believe on the whole, the concern of all mankind. And here our leaders at the relevant level should take m atters seriously and find an acceptable solution. Many prom inent scientists of world rank have spoke of the need for such an 256"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"approach. Why it hasn’ t com e about y et is ha rd to say ... Many countries today have reached a certain level in science and in the study of this question. We have obtained certain results and at present the issue is the creation of som e single body that would bring together all our knowledge on this m atter. I believe things would be easi er then. The Am ericans have got som ething interesting, so have we. Conclusions have b een m ade and data assem bled, for y ears gone by as well, and now they have been “shelved” som ewhere. Perhaps it would be enough to put one thing together with another for the whole questi on to appear in a com pletely different light... There was a case with us outside Moscow when tw o warrant officers felt an inner urge to go outside. And one of them found him self directly at the landing site of a fly ing device. He m ade mental contact – not at the level of speech, but te lepathically , in thought form s. He was given an invitation to visit the space-ship, but due to f ear or som e purely personal reasons he couldn’ t accept. Later he m ade som e interesting drawings of the ship. I saw their explanatory notes and drawings depicting what they had seen. Thei r account was supplem ented by the reports and drawings of the duty officers and their deputies and a whole num ber of conscripts who were on guard duty . In all the accounts, the place and tim e were com patible and the drawings of the ship fly ing away had m uch in com mon... When you have the m ass of docum entary m ateri al which I have worked with, from specific people, eye-witnesses, and that over a period of several y ears, in different regions, then y our attitude to the UFO phenom enon naturally chang es. You know, I have kept som e photographs for m yself... There are a large num ber of facts like that, in explicable for contem porary science. As if som e kind of intelligence was reacting. VU: What do y ou think – are UFOs representatives of other civilizations? VA: I think that if their level of civilizati on allows them to m ove in space across great distances, possibly in other form s of m aterial – and that is indeed the case – then at their level of developm ent, when it com es down to it, they are also concerned about norm al relations between people, som e sort of progress, ultim ately the surv ival of intelligent life, if it does exist in the world. And if we look at the Earth from that point of view, then our whole history is a tale of self-destruction, and not creation. It’s the history of m urders and the death of whole peoples. Not a singe truly civilized society could tolerate that. Life has a different m eaning. No norm al person can walk past if a child is drowning! They w ill save it, if only because th e child represents their future. And the higher the level of civilization, th e greater the awareness of that. If that works at the level of the single individual, then it will also work at the level of civilizations. But they do not interfere nevertheless, because each civiliza tion should develop independently , according to certain laws. Outside interference in natural processes is alway s a risky business. But som e sort of correction, not allowing processes of disintegration to being when they will bring the history of civilization to an end, is evidently incl uded in the plans of the Higher Intelligence. 257"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"258"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"259"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"260"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"261"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"262"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"263"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"264"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"265"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":" Testimony of Master Sergeant Dan Morri s, USAF (Retired)/ NRO Operative Septem ber 2000 Dan Morris is a retired Air Force career Master Sergeant who was involved in the extraterrestrial projects for m any years. Af ter leaving the Air Force, he was recruited into the super-secret National Reconnaissance Organization, or NRO, during which tim e he worked specifically on extraterrestrial-connected operations. He had a cosm ic top secret clearance (38 levels above top secret) which, he states, no U.S. president, to his knowledge, has ever held. In his testim ony , he talks of assassinations com mitted by the NSA; he tells how our m ilitary deliberately caused the 1947 ET craft crashes near Roswell, and captured one of the ETs, which they kept at Los Alam os for 3 y ears, until he died. He talks about the intelligence team s that were charged with intim idating, discred iting, and even elim inating witnesses to ET/UFO events. He talks about Germ any ’s re-engineering of UFOs, even prior to WWII. He talks about our current energy crisis — and the fact that we haven’t needed fossil fuels since the 1940s, when free energy technologies were developed — but have been kept from hum anity . This is the real reason for the secrecy of the ET/UFO subject. “What the people in power right now don’t want us to know is that this free energy is available to every body .” In conclusion, he warns against the weaponization of space and the shooting down of ET craft — this could force them to retaliate, and that would be our destruction. I had a clearance 38 levels above top secret, which is cosm ic top secret -it is the top of all of those clearances. It is for UFOs, and aliens, etc. No president has had that level, has ever been cleared for that level. Eisenhower was the clo sest. Well, there are sever al intelligence agencies- the Arm y had it, the Air Force had it, the Navy had it. And then there were several secret intelligence agencies. One that did not exist, it was so secret, was the NRO. You couldn’ t mention NRO. It is the National Reconnaissance Or ganization. If y ou’ re on that level, then there’s an organization worldwide called ACIO, that’s Alien Contact Intelligence Organization. If y ou pay your dues and y ou follow the rules, y our governm ent is allowed to benefit from that organization’s inform ation. Now som e people call it the high frontier. The Navy Intelligence refer to them selves that way som etim es. And th ey all work together. Air Force intelligence, Naval intelligence, and the NRO were at one tim e a ll in a certain part of Langley Air Force Base in Virginia. And m ost of the satellite interpreters were there, most of the intelligence interpreters from the Air Force, the Arm y, the Navy were there, that’ s where they worked and interpreted. Now, Eisenhower wanted som ebody to be in charge, he tried the CIA Director, and it didn’t work. The CIA was working prim arily for itself. Most of the intelligence directors of the services were working for them selves. So he said, “I want it to be independent, I want it to be civilian. I want it to be som e of our top scientists.” So it was organized but the nam e of the NRO was kept secret for y ears. About 1968 was when it cam e into being independen tly . Now before that, during the war, we had the OSS, the Office of Strategic Services, and that was m ostly spy soldiers, y ou know, m en from certain parts of the arm ed forces form ed under the OSS. I never spied for the OSS. I was in Air Force intelligence. And another thing that gave m e a high security clearance was I was a CONRAD courier... 266"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"And so when I retired from the Air Force, they knew that I knew som e of this stuff, and so that’s why they gave m e the chance to go work for som ebody else who knew that too -- the NRO.

They ’re the guy s that, when it becom es necessary for a ‘problem ’ to be rem ove d, they ’re...if y ou watch Jam es Bond, they ’re double-O agents, if y ou get m y m eaning. And Secretary of Defense Forestall was the first real powerful known person that was elim inated becau se he was going to release the inform ation. And nobody has ever paid for that crim e, that cr im e has never really been thoroughly investigated by forces to see what happened to him . But m ost people know that he was thrown out the window of a hospital - but he wasn’t killed by being thrown out the window, but he never got up alive... There are other people who have been elim inat ed for what they know. One was a friend of mine, Phil Sny der, who worked out here in New Me xico building the tunnels- the biggest one that he was involved with was the Dulce underground facility . ... And I know that Phil loved this country and he thought these program s were by passing our form of governm ent. The way it was set up, there were too many black projects going on, and none were approved by our Congress. [See the testimony of Clifford Stone. SG] No Congress ever voted on any of these black projects, and he believed the Am erican people had a right to know what they were spending their money for and what we were capable of doing. And he started talking, so they got rid of him ... But m yself, I’m 73 y ears old and I’ve had a good life and no regrets, and I’ve loved this country and I’ve been a Christian all my life, since I was about 11 y ears old, so I believe God wants this known, and I believe the cosm os want s this known. And I believe that if we don’t break the secrecy ... we’ re doing our people a great harm keeping it so secret. And if we don’ t break it, I believe som ebody else will. Som ebody out side of this planet. I believe som e of the people who have been with us the last fifty years will break the secret... Now the two guy s who were down there, I told them , “You got y our cam eras - Official Air Force cam eras? Go outside and take pictures, go out and tell m e what y ou see.” And they cam e back and said, “There are UFOs sitting out there in form ation!” I said, “Well, take pictures, get the cam eras and take pictures.” And I told the other two, turn the radar cam eras on, because we had radar cam eras that took pictures, too. So that was all there, and this building we we re in had one whole side that was glass French doors, so if y ou set the radarscope, y ou’ d look out side and see there were UFOs. And so I called headquarters. I said, “Okay , we have a contact .” He say s, “You m ean SAC is running a m ission against y ou? ” I said, “Not SAC, not SAC.” He say s, “What, then? ” I said, “Cosm os.” He said, “Wait a m inute.

He heads back to Air Proving Ground Com mand, and we were never, officially notified that they ever received those pictures- it went secret, it went black, like it never happened.

Keep them for y our grandkids...” Do y ou know why we stopped exploding nuclear weapons? We were ordered to do it by those ETs from Orion. Orion - they cam e down and they told us, “Look, y ou can destroy yourselves, so we won’t put up with that. And if you do that, if y ou explode that planet, and you’ve got the capability now...” That’s when we really got their attention and they cam e down and they said, “Look, we won’t let y ou destroy your planet.” So we want y ou to stop all nuclear testing. They had already stopped us from usi ng weapons. And then they told us, “No more nuclear testing.” Now Russia and the United States, we were firm believers by then that those people could do what they said. And y ou saw the tim e they all showed up over Washington, D.C., and we went our jets up after them , and every tim e the jets would go up, the UFOs would zap out, or they ’d go to another dim ension. The jets would com e back to base and the UFOs would be back over Washington. Scared the hell out of every body in Washington, what are they going to do? What happened was that we found out that high-powered radar would interfere with their stability , because we could watch the am plifiers and stabilizers com e down when they were low and slow. Radar affected the UFOs when they were low and slow. We already knew that, we knew it before ‘47, before they cam e down. A nd where was most of our radar? White Sands, and down at Roswell. Who was stationed at Ro swell? The only nuclear bom b squadron in the world. So they were interested and we had a lo t of radar there, because we were going to protect as m uch as we could. Well, we focused several , big, powerful radars on them , and it caused two of them to run together. One of them was th e one that went down and landed on the ranch, the other was the one that went down into the bank and it had two aliens on it ly ing outside when we got there. One of them was wounded or hurt, a nd the other was alive then, but before we could get him any where, he had already passed on. But the other we kept at Los Alam os over here for about three y ears. He got sick. We sent out on every frequency range we could and every thing that he was sick, that we didn’ t do it, that they could com e and get him if they wanted to. But he died before they got here. But they cam e and got his body , and that’s when they went to Washington and had that form ation over Wash ington. So they retrieved his body . One tim e we shot down one and we were catchi ng hell for that. But what do y ou think we did with all these nuclear weapons that we and Ru ssia had? We put nuclear weapons out in space as a line of defense. And we were ready to blow them up if they started in. ... I becam e part of a group that would investigate, gather the inform ation, and in the beginning it was still under the Blue Book, Snowbird and diffe rent covert program s. I would go interview people who claim ed they had seen som ething and try to convince them they hadn’ t seen som ething or that they were hallucinating. Well, if that didn’t work, another team would com e in and give all the threats. And threaten them and their fam ily and so on and so forth. And they would be in charge of discrediting them , m aking th em look foolish and so on and so forth. Now if that didn’ t work, then there was another team that put an end to that problem , one way or another. ... So, there would be cover stories deliberately put out and then de-bunked.

It was 1931, ‘32, and they took them to Germ any and started, like we do now, re-engineering. They got ah ead, and even before the war started, they had a workable UFO... We’ve got plenty of film , docum entary film to show that in the archives. And then we got a whole bunch m ore from the Germ ans after the war, because we brought, not only Von Braun, but we brought Scharberger over here and som e of thei r electrom agnetic people who were working on the UFOs. And he gave us a jum p on every body else. Now the Russians took som e people, too, but we had the m ain ones. Scharberger was out here in New Mexico, and he helped us in White Sands and other places around New Mexico. And then he felt we’d done him wrong and he we nt hom e and two weeks after he went hom e he was killed. UFOs are both extraterrestrial and m an m ade. Well, the guy s that were doing the UFOs, they weren’t sleeping, and Townsend Brown was one of our guy s who was alm ost up with the Germ ans. So we had a problem . We had to keep Townsend Brown- what he was doing on anti- gravity electrom agnetic propulsion secret. Even back in Tesla’ s tim e, we had free energy that we could transfer. All you had to do was just put up an antennae and put a stake in the ground and you could light this house and have all the energy you needed. But what do we run on? For the last century , we’ve run on petroleum . Who’s in c ontrol of the petroleum in the world? A lot of people think that Iraq, Iran, and so on, are. They aren’t. We control it, us and the British interests. Well, som e people refer to this as th e secret governm ent. A group of the richest men in the world control petroleum .

Now som e would like for us to believe and would like to develop the idea that the aliens are our enem y now. There’ s no proof that I have ever read in any official docum ent where, unless they were attacked, that they ever shot. And one instance I’ ll tell you about involved Russia. Now this involved an adm iral who had a son who was a MIG pilot in their air force. We had an F-18 up in Alaska. And the Russians would send their badgers and their beavers out, they ’d send their MIGs out, so the 21 st Fighter Squadron in Alaska, they ’d go up and intercept them . And they were all arm ed. Fortunately nobody fired. So our controller saw, when these MIGs were m ixing it up, that there was another ship that m oved in, and our controller was listening to the Russians say , “Intercep t that ship.” They referred to it as ship, it wasn’ t any thing we knew or the Russians knew. A nd so the two MIGs started intercepting. Our guy was told by our controller, “Get out of there, stay in view, but don’t y ou try to intercept that ship!” So as soon as the Russian fighters turned on their arm ament targeted the UFO, the m issiles were both destroy ed just like that, one after the other.

Mr. Phillips fu rther states that there are records and film ed docum entation of m eetings in Calif ornia in 1954 between ETs and leaders of the USA. He lists a few of the technologi es we were able to develop because of the ETs: com puter chips, lasers, night vision, bulletproof vests, and concludes, “Are these ET people hostile? Well, if they were hostile, with their weaponry they could have destroy ed us a long tim e ago — or could have done som e dam age.” Mr. Phillips now develops technologies that can help elim inate environm ental pollutants and reduce the need for fossil fuels: en ergy generation sy stem s that use natural energies from planet Earth. DP: Mr. Don Phillips SG: Dr. Steven Greer DP: So Angels Peak was a classified radar installa tion. And, it’ s, a lot of radar installations, as we know them , are up in the m iddle of no where. We would m onitor the aircraft com ing from Las Vegas into Area 51 or whatever passed by . A nd, it was whatever passed by that becam e m ost interesting one night, in 1966, to ‘67. That night, I heard a lot of com motion about 1:00 in the morning. We were at 8,000 feet; the radar dom es were at 10,500, approxim ately . So I decided to get up and walked up to the m ain road, and up near m y office. I got to the area where the fellows were standing- there was a group of about five people- and they were looking up in the air. And, I looked up in the air and saw these objects, lighted objects, m oving at trem endous speeds... Right at that instant I saw these things m aking acute angles and traveling, I would estim ate 3,000 to 4,000 m iles per hour. And, then im mediately m aking acute turns. I knew that they weren’t ours...And, then, all of a sudden, they seem ed to group, from what would be hundreds of m iles in the sky to the west. And they cam e into a circle, rotated into a circle, and then disappeared. And, I thought, wow, what a show. So, the security Sergeant happened to be on duty . And, we all looked at each other and said, gee, this is really som ething. And, he said, well, we shouldn’ t really say any thing about this. Well, I had a buddy that was chief radar operator nam ed Anthony Kasar...He was alm ost as white as a sheet. He took one step down the steps and he looked at m e and he said, did y ou see those? And, I said, y eah, we’ ve been watching them - som e of the fellows have been watching them for the last four to five m inutes. And, I’ve seen them for a little m ore than 90 seconds. He say s, we saw them on the radar screen and we docum ented them . He say s, they are not bogey s. They are not apparitions. They are real solid object s. And, of course, they would have to be in order to get a fix with radar, the kind of radar we used there, it would have to be a solid object. And, it’s not that we tr acked them with the radar- they would go in and out of the signal and register that way. He finally docum ented that there were six to seven.

SG: Had you heard of anti-gravity propulsion sy stem s being worked on while y ou were at Lockheed Skunkworks? DP : The propulsion sy stem that y ou are asking about, I heard that it existed. But, the left hand never knew what the right hand was doing, and, for good reason. ... We have records from 1954 that were meetings between our own leaders of this country and ET s here in California. And, as I understand it from the written docum entation, we were asked if we would allow them to be here and do research. I have read that our reply was, well, how can we stop y ou, y ou are so advanced? And, I will say by this cam era and this sound, that it was President Eisenhower that had this m eeting. And, it was on film , sort of like what we are doing now. Bringing it up to date, the NATO report gave that there were 12 races. To m ake a final sum mary, they had to have contacts to go to these races in order to understand who they are, what they are doing, and what they could do. ... Are these ET people hostile? Well, if they were hostile, with their weaponry they could have destroy ed us a long tim e ago, or could have done som e dam age. ... The reason they crashed is that their guidance mechanism was interrupted by our radar and by som e equipm ent that we have. Even more validating for m e was that one of our contract scientists for our private concern, Light City Technologies, Incorporated, worked with these technologies. He worked with a couple of those technologies while he was with a very prom inent intelligence agency of the United States Governm ent. The one person that I’ve talked to outside of the m ilitary or th e governm ent level is SG. And, the reason for that is because he m akes it the pr ofessional approach, which is m ore in line with the way we were in the m ilitary . About the ET lenses: there were som e eyeball coverings that allowed the people inside the craft that m ade the journey across space to see in the m inim al light that we know is now present during space travel. These lenses m agnified light, but also brought in a certain ty pe of clarity . And, m y reason for m entioning this was that it w as Earth doctors and specialists that got them into the rem oval and study of these lenses. I think a lot of this has been well docum ente d by Colonel Corso. You know, who was there with him ? Well, there were a lot of people there w ith him . But a lot of the things that are said in the book by Colonel Corso, I can verify , corroborat ed by people that I have worked with and do work with now. So, I can say what I know about it is very true. The pathway that it took, that’s another story . We talk about hidden technologies and why don’t they let people know about it?

Well, SG, one of the purposes for founding this technology corporation that I did in 1998 was to bring forth these technologies that can help get ri d of the toxins -- that can clean the air, that help get rid of the need for so m uch fossil fuel or help it becom e m ore efficient. Yes, it is tim e. I can tell y ou, personally , that it has already started. And I can prove what we have com e up with. We can prove it... Testimony of Captain Bill Uhouse, USMC (ret.) October 2000 Bill Uhouse served 10 y ears in the Marine Corps as a fighter pilot, and four years with the Air Force at Wright-Patterson AFB as a civilian doing flight-testing of exotic experim ental aircraft. Later, for the next 30 y ears, he worked for defense contractors as an engineer of antigravity propulsion sy stem s: on flight sim ulators for exotic aircraft — and on actual fly ing discs. He testifies that that the first disc they tested was the re- engineered ET craft that crashed in Kingm an, Arizona in 1958. He further testifies that the ET’ s presented a craft to the US governm ent; this craft was taken to Area 51, which was just being constructed at the tim e, and the four ET’ s that accom panied the craft were taken to Los Alam os. Mr. Uhouse’ s specialty was the flight deck and the instrum ents on the flight deck — he understood the gravitational field and what it took to get people trained to experience antigrav ity . He actually m et several tim es with an ET that helped the phy sicists and engineers with the engineering of the craft. I spent 10 y ears in the Marine Corps, and four years working with the Air Force as a civilian doing experim ental testing on aircraft since m y Marine Corps day s. I was a pilot in the service, and a fighter pilot; [ I] fought in ... after the latte r part of WWII and the Korean War Conflict, I was discharged as a Captain in the Marine Corps. I didn’t start working on flight sim ulators until about - well the y ear was 1954, in Septem ber. After I got out of the Marine Corps, I took a job with the Air Force at Wright Patterson doing experim ental flight-testing on various di fferent m odifications of aircraft. While I was at Wright Patterson, I was appr oached by an individual who — and I’m not going to mention his nam e — [wanted] to determ ine if I wanted to work in an area on new creative devices. Okay ? And, that was a fly ing disc sim ulator. What they had done: they had selected several of us, and they reassigned m e to A-Link Aviation, which was a sim ulator manufacturer. At that tim e they were building what they called the C-11B, and F-102 sim ulator, 281"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"B-47 sim ulator, and so forth. They wanted us to get experienced before we actually started work on the fly ing disc sim ulator, which I spent 30-som e years working on. I don’t think any fly ing disc sim ulators went into operation until the early 1960s — around 1962 or 1963. The reason why I am say ing this is because the sim ulator wasn’ t actually functional until around 1958. The sim ulator that they used was for the extraterrestrial craft they had, which is a 30-m eter one that crashed in Ki ngm an, Arizona, back in 1953 or 1952. That’s the first one that they took out to the test flight. This ET craft was a controlled craft that the aliens wanted to present to our governm ent — the U.S.A. It landed about 15 m iles from what used to be an arm y airbase, which is now a defunct arm y base. But that particular craft, there were som e problem s with: num ber one - getting it on the flatbed to take it up to Area 51. They couldn’ t get it across the dam because of the road. It had to be barged across the Colo rado River at the tim e, and then taken up Route 93 out to Area 51, which was just being constructed at the tim e. There were four aliens aboard that thing, and those aliens went to Los Alam os for testing. They set up Los Alam os with a particular area for those guy s, and they put certain peopl e in there with them — people that were astrophy sicists and general scientists — to ask them questions. The way the story was told to m e was: there was only one alien that would talk to any of these scientists that they put in the lab with them . The rest wouldn’t talk to any body , or even have a conversation with them . You know, first they thought it was all ESP or telepathy , but y ou know, m ost of that is kind of a joke to m e, because they actually speak — m aybe not like we do — but they actually speak and converse. But there was only one who would [ at Los Alam os] . The difference between this disc, and other discs that they had looked at was that this one was a much sim pler design. The disc sim ulator didn’ t have a reactor, [but] we had a space in it that looked like the reactor that wasn’ t the device we operated the sim ulator with. We operated it with six large capacitors that were charged with a m illion volts each, so there were six m illion volts in those capacitors. They were the largest capacitors ever built. Th ese particular capacitors, they ’d last for 30 m inutes, so y ou could get in there and actually work the controls and do what y ou had to — to get the sim ulator, the disc to operate. So, it wasn’ t that sim ple, because we only had 30 minutes. Okay ? But, in the sim ulator you’ ll notice that there are no seat belts. Right? It was the sam e thing with the actual craft — no seat belts. You don’ t need seat belts, because when y ou fly one of these things upside down, there is no upside down like in a regular aircraft — y ou just don’t feel it. There’s a sim ple explanation for that: y ou have y our own gravitational field right inside the craft, so if y ou are fly ing upside down — to y ou — y ou are right side up. I m ean, it’s just really sim ple, if people would look at it. I was inside the actual alien craft for a start-up... There weren’t any windows. The only way we had any visibility at all was done with cam eras or video-ty pe devices. [See the testimony of M ark M cClandlish. SG] My specialty was the flight deck and the instrum ents on the flight deck. I knew about the gravitational field and what it took to get people trained. Because the disc has its own gravitational field, y ou would be sick or disoriented for about two minutes after getting in, after it was cranked up. It takes a lot of tim e to becom e used to it. Because of the area and the sm allness of it, just to raise your hand becom es com plicated. You have to be trained — trained with y our m ind, to accept what y ou are going to actually feel and experience. 282"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"Just moving about is difficult, but after a while you get used to it and y ou do it — it’s sim ple. You just have to know where every thing is, and you [ have] to understand what’s going to happen to your body . It’s no different than accepting the g-forces when y ou are fly ing an aircraft or com ing out of a dive. It’s a whole new ball gam e. Each engineer that had any thing to do with the design was part of the start-up crew. We would have to verify all the equipm ent that we put in — be sure it [ worked] like it [ was] supposed to, etc. I’m sure our crews have taken these craft out into space. I’ m say ing it probably took a while to train enough of the people, over a sufficient tim e period. The whole problem with the disc is that it is so exacting in its design and so forth. It can’ t be used like we use aircraft today , with dropping bom bs and having m achine guns in the wings. The design is so exacting, that y ou can’ t add any thing — it’ s got to be just right. There’ s a big problem in the design of where things are put. Say , where the center of the aircraft is, and that ty pe of thing. Even the fact that we rai sed it three feet so the taller guy s could get in — the actual ship was extended back to its original configuration, but it has to be raised. We had m eetings, and I ended up in a m eeting with an alien. I called him J-ROD — of course, that’s what they called him . I don’t know if that was his real nam e or not, but that’s the nam e the linguist gave him . I did draw a sketch, before I left, of him in a m eeting. I provided it to som e people and that was m y im pression of what I saw. The alien used to com e in with [Dr. Edward] Teller and som e of the other guy s, o ccasionally , to handle questions that m aybe we’ d have. You know? But y ou have to understand that every thing was specific to the group. If it wasn’t specific to the group, y ou couldn’t talk about it. It was on a need-to-know basis. And [ the ET] he’d talk. He would talk, but he’d sound ju st like as if y ou spoke — he’d sound like you. You know, he’s like a parrot, but he’d try and answ er y our question. A lot of tim es he’d have a hard tim e understanding, because if y ou didn’ t put it on paper and explain y ourself, half the tim e he couldn’t give y ou a good answer. The preparation we had before m eeting this alien was, basically , going through all of the different nationalities in the world. Then they got into going into other form s of life, even down to anim als and that ty pe of thing. And...this J-ROD — his skin was pinkish, but a little bit rough — that kind of stuff; not horrible-looking, y ou know — or to m e, he wasn’t horrible-looking. Som e of the guy s who were in the particular group that I was in — they never even m ade it. You know, when they gave y ou the psy chological questions, I just answered them the way I felt and I had no problem . That’s what they wanted to know — if y ou’d becom e upset — but it never bothered m e. It didn’t am ount to m uch. So basically , the alien was only giving engineering advice and science advice. For exam ple, I perform ed the calculations but needed m ore he lp...I spoke of a book that — well it’s not a book; it’s a big assem bly with various divisions dea ling with gravitational technology , and the key elem ents are in there, but all the inform ation wasn ’t there. Even our top m athem aticians couldn’t figure som e of this stuff out, so the alien would assist. Som etim es y ou’ d get into a spot where you [ would] try and try and try , and it wouldn’t work. And that’s when he’d [ the alien] com e in. They would tell him to look at this and see what we did wrong. Over the last 40 years or so, not counting the sim ulators — I’m talking about actual craft — there are probably two or three-dozen, and various sizes that we built. 283"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"I don’t know m uch about the [ ET] ones that they brought here. I know about that one [ craft] out of Kingm an but that’s about it. And, I know the com pany that hauled it out of there — who is out here now — but... But, there’ s one that operates with certain chem icals. I think these triangles that people are seeing are two or three 30-m eter craft, that are in the center of it [ the triangle] . And, the outside pe rim eter — well you could put any thing y ou want, as long as these particular ones m eet the design criteria, and they ’ll operate. You know, there were certain reasons for th e secrecy . I could understand that; it was no different than the first atom ic bom b that they bu ilt.

He has an electrical engin eering degree and was in charge of all the construction projects for the Military Air Com mand.

Colonel William s also relates another story that his father told him : One tim e attending a dinner party he had a conversation with a high-level RAND official who told him that the governm ent was spending more m oney on antigravity devices than any other project in the history of this country . JW: Lt. Col. John William s SG: Dr. Steven Greer JW: There was one facility at Norton Air Force Base that was close hold- not even the wing com mander there could know what was going on. During that tim e period it was alway s rum ored by the pilots that that was a cover for in fact the location of one UFO craft. The reason for that location was that folks could com e out, land at Nort on, play golf, be part of a golf tournam ent and so forth and during that process could go by the facility and actually see the UFO. But I was never allowed in that area when I w as there at Norton Air Force Base. ...

It’s also possible that back in the early ‘50s that Eisenhower actually visited that facility ... During a dinner party with a very , very close friend, a RAND em ploy ee was invited. This is located in the Ventura area, which was near th eir RAND operation. This story im pacted m y father and he relay ed it m any tim es to m e. He said that during that party after several drinks this RAND official said that the governm ent was spe nding more money on antigravity than any other project in the history of this country . Therefore he believed at that tim e that we had actually developed operational antigravity sy stem s. Th at spending would probably have been started shortly after World War II, I would think. That th is would be an ongoing effort for m any years. I basically understand that the person who relay ed this inform ation was at a high level there at RAND Corporation.... Testim ony of Mr. Don Johnson Decem ber 2000 Mr. Johnson was putting him self through colle ge working at Century Graphics in 1971/72. Part of his job was to run blueprints through a large printing m achine. Century Graphics used to get jobs from various m ilitary electronics firm s such as Lockheed, Litton, Hughes and RCA. While he had a low clearance, there were tim es when his assistance was needed on top secret docum ents. In one case he was working on a lithograph negative of the routes for all the Am erican and Russian subs. In his testim ony he states that he also worked on a huge electronic diagram from Hughes- Sum a Corporation. In the center of the di agram in a large rectangle it said “antigravity cham ber.” When he com pleted his work he turned to the m an training him showing him the verbiage.

He has friends at the NSA, CIA, NASA, JPL, ONI , NRO, Area 51, the Air Force, Northrup, Boeing, and others. He used to work at Boeing as a surface technician. He was introduced to four-star General Curtis Lem ay and one day went to his house in Newport Beach, CA and spoke with him about this s ubject. Lem ay confirm ed the ETC crash at Roswell. AH’ s NSA contact told him that Henry Kissinger, George Bush as well as Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev were all aware of the ET subject. His CIA contact told him that the USAF had shot down som e of these spacecraft. A friend of AH’ s who worked at Boeing was part of crash recovery and personally saw and carried ET bodies. AH say s that a group in the FBI discovered that radar testing was causing interference with som e of the ETV’s and that this was what was causing so m any 285"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"crashes.

AH: A. H. SG: Dr. Steven Greer AH: ...And I asked Curtis LaMay and I said Curt, when y ou were in the Air Force out of the 100 percent of the sightings [ of UFOs] that cam e in to the Air Force how m any of them rem ained not identified? And he said out of the 100 percen t that cam e in only 35 percent of them could not be identified. And I asked well, why couldn’ t they have been identified. And he said because the craft were too dam n fast. We can’t catch them . In fact, he used som e foul language in there too in his explanation. And then I asked him about the Roswell crash, if that really occurred. And he looked over at me and he shook his head, y es, that it did occur. And I said that I was particularly interested in the strange writings that were found inside. I asked if they were ever deciphered. And he said as far as he understood they were not deciphered when he was in office...Then Curtis LaMay started to open up and talk about Roswell and the crash that occurred. And he told m e that he was aware that it wasn’t ours, it wasn’t the m ilitary ’s, the Air Force or the Arm y or the Navy , and that it was a highly strange vehicle that crashed. ... And by the way , Majestic 12 is real. MJ12 did exist. But it does not exist today . The nam e was changed. The positions are still the sam e. Henry Kissinger is very knowledgeable about what’s going on. Henry Kissinger was in the loop, I was told. SG: Who told y ou this? AH: A friend of m ine who worked at the NSA [National Security Agency ] told m e this. He saw Henry Kissinger’s nam e on docum ents. He saw George Bush’s nam e on som e of the docum ents. He was m ade aware of what’s goi ng on. About 1978 Reagan was fully briefed on the alien presence. Reagan told Mikhail Gorbach ev of Russia about 75 percent of what’ s going on. And then Gorbachev becam e very , very close to us. ... A CNN reporter in Washington, D.C., the second tim e that Gorbachev cam e to Am erica, was able to interview Gorbachev and hi s wife. When they got out on the street they drove the security detail up the wall. And a CNN reporter asked Gorb achev ‘do y ou think we should get rid of all our nuclear weapons?’ And his wife stepped in and she said, no, I don’t think we should get rid of all our nuclear weapons because of alien spacecraft. Now CNN put this story on for the half hour, on CNN headline news; I heard this and I jum ped up and put a blank tape in to record the next half-hour. Well, that story disappeared and you know who intercepted that. It was the CIA that got involved with that, because I know that they were m onitoring CNN and all international head lines at that tim e. They squashed that, but I heard it. And this tells m e that m y inform ation is correct about Ronald Reagan, from m y NSA source. The secrecy is just total overkill as far as I’ m concerned. And the Congress needs to know about this inform ation. ... The CIA agent, Brett Merrill, told m e that he had dealt with the United States Air Force regarding m issiles to try to shoot these down, when th ey com e into our airspace.

In 1947 wh en he was inducted in the United States Arm y several of his friends were in the CIC, counter intelligence, and they becam e very close to one another. And he handpicked a friend of m ine th at worked at Boeing Aircraft Com pany in Long Beach to becom e a part of ET crash recovery / retrieval in northern New Mexico. He saw som e of the aliens and witnessed the cr aft guarded this crashed disc that had crashed and they gave him an M1 carving rifle to guard against any body who tried to get close to it. And they were given orders to shoot any body wit hout authorization. They recalled him on several other crashes. They had to fly him with blackened out windows to several of the crash sites. ... My friend had seen personally the dead aliens. They had dark alm ond-shaped ey es, a rather large head- a little bit larger than a hum an head. Their bodies were about the size of about a nine- year-old child. They had four fingers, no thum b. He told m e that they all looked like they cam e out of a m old, because they all looked the sam e. And their m ouths were just a sm all slit. They had real sm all ears, no hair on the head, just really strange looking to him . He thought they were probably part of genetic research. But the technology that he saw in the craft could not be of hum an origin because of the fiber optics that were found inside. And som e of the slide switches that they had inside the craft we di dn’t have and nobody else on Earth would have that type of technology . ...The 1949 crash was a rather large craft and the people inside were a little bit taller. They were about 5’ 8” tall. They kind of looked like the ancient race around Palestine, probably about 3,000 BC. He told m e that he picked up one of these alie ns and put it onboard one of the jeeps. And he said that it felt like it weighed only about 45 pounds at m ost, m aybe 40. And they put them in body bags and took them to Wright Patterson Air Fo rce base at the tim e. Later they started taking som e of them to Colorado and northern New Mexi co and then later on to Area 51 in the late 1960s. All crash debris and technology and any thing that had to do with the alien connected phenom enon, all went to Area 51 after that date. ... They found out that the radar testing in New Mexi co was the cause of a lot of them that were crashing. When they would get too close to hi gh powered transm itters they would interfere with their guidance control and they would just crash. The other craft that crashed we had shot them down with our m ilitary weapons. One of the things that I do rem ember him telling me is that there is another alien group that looks a lot like the hum an race, and they are called the Orange. ... But he did tell m e that he worked on the craft to back engineer them . He’ s aware of their existence. He knows that I m et the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General Lem ay. He told m e several tim es of the testing that took place at Area 51, that som e of them com e up behind the mountain.

I found that out from a friend at Boeing that told me that they were hiring up there for trucking for som e of the m ilitary sites. And I found out from him that he had personally gone onto Area 51, escorted to Area 51, from the main highway . This witness is still alive. In fact, he knows wh ere the aliens are originating from . As far as he understands there is an underground area there and there are a lot of extraterrestrial debris down below Area 51 and stored in som e sort of a containm ent area. But he has never seen any extraterrestrials at Area 51 walking around and conversing with any body . He just saw the craft and the technology that they ’re try ing to ex tract from these vehicles to incorporate that technology into our fighters and possibly som e of our space program s. They have developed laser technology and sound wave defense m echanism s from study ing these ET craft. They can use sound waves to blow up tanks and buildings.

They have no Congressional oversight whatsoever. They answ er to nobody , except for the President of the United States. But they are try ing to push even that aside, away from the President, from what I understand. The Presidents no longer have that m uch control over these groups any more.

They have agents out in the field, just like the CIA, collecting inform ation. It’ s all very , very top secret... Most of the craft operate on antigravity and elect ro-gravitic propulsion. We are just about at the conclusion state right now regarding antigrav ity . I would give it m aybe about 15 y ears and we will have cars that will levitate using this ty pe of technology . We’re doing it up at Area 51 right now. That’s som e of the stuff that m y buddy worked on up at Area 51 with Northrup, who lives now in Pahrum p, Nevada. We’re fly ing anti-grav ity vehicles up there and in Utah right now... For exam ple, the inform ation that we have managed to collect regarding the face on Mars, which I know for a fact is real, would have a great im pact. I have another contact at NASA, JPL that I haven’ t mentioned. I can’ t m ention too m uch about it because he is still working there. This person that I know is very high up in NASA. He said they know it’ s a face. They know that it was carved by som ebody other than us. In an im aging area, they know for a fact that the face on Mars is real and that it was not m ade by winds torm s or trick of lighting or any thing like that. They know for a fact that the face on Mars was m ade from an extraterrestrial race that cam e here to Earth about 45,000 y ears BC. ... Testimony of British Police Officer Alan Godfrey (retired) Septem ber 2000 Officer Alan Godfrey is a retired police officer who served in the West Yorkshire Metropolitan Police in England from 1975 to 1984. On Novem ber 28 th 1980, he and five other officers witnessed a UFO. He saw a diam ond shaped object about 75 feet away hovering just five feet above the gr ound and he estim ates it to be about 20 feet wide and about 14 feet tall. The bottom half appeared to be rotating and the top was stationary and it did not m ake any noise. Mont hs after reporting this incident, he started being harassed. He was transferred 50 m iles away and was eventually barred from entering his own police station. Contraband drugs were placed in his locker. I ... was in a police patrol car heading toward Burnleigh, on the A646. I looked up the main road which I was traveling on, and I saw approxim ately 150 y ards up in front of me an object. My first reaction was that it was a double-decker bus . Nevertheless, I headed toward this object. As I got close to it- within about 25 y ards of the object - and what I saw quite baffled m e. I thought one of these hot air balloons had com e down. Then I thought, it’ s five in the morning. Then I realized that this object was actually hovering off the ground; as I sat in the police car I could actually see under the object. It was hovering about five feet off the ground. 290"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"The span of it was taking m uch of the road up, so it was about 20 feet wide, because the road’ s pretty narrow just there.

I put on the patrol car’ s blue lights, headlights, hazard lights, any thing y ou can think of. This was totally blocking the road. It was diam ond in shape. It appeared to be in two halves joined together. The bottom half appeared to be rotating, the top half looked like it was stationary , and it also I t hought it had dark windows or panels that went all the way around. I was absolutely gobsm acked. The bushes and the trees that lined the road were shaking very , very violently , as though there was a strong wind blowing but m y car was apparently stationary . I didn’t feel any vibrations in the car, I didn’t h ear any noise, it wasn’ t m aking any noise, not that I could hear...It’ s totally nothing like an aircraft. You see, aircraft fly , don’ t they , unless y ou’ re a jum p jet. This thing was actually hovering and it was m oving and I suppose it com es in the classic UFO, unidentified fly ing object, status.

I was absolutely am azed at what happened after that. My life just turned upside down in an instant.

Testimony of Mr. Gordon Creighton, Former British Foreign Service Official Septem ber 2000 Mr. Creighton spent many years in the British Foreign Service. He spent 10 y ears in China and in 1941 he saw a UFO while at the Em bassy . In broad day light he saw a disc-shaped, silent UFO with a blue white light on top fly ing very fast. In 1953 he spent som e tim e with the Military Defen se in Whitehall and worked on the floor underneath a departm ent, Air Technical, dea ling with UFO’s.

Stalin becam e aware, at a very early date, in ‘47, after the UFO crashed in New Mexico. Stalin was collecting reports from all over the place. And, one day he called in their top astronom er and showed him all these reports. And, Stalin said to him , sit down there, look at that, and what do you think about it? And, apparently he said, well, can I take it hom e and look at it? Stalin said, no, y ou are going to sit here, in the Krem lin, until I get y our answer. So, apparently he gave him the answer.

Testimony of Sergeant Karl Wolfe, US Air Force Septem ber 2000 Karl Wolfe was in the Air Force for 41/2 y ears beginning in January 1964. He had a top secret cry pto clearance and worked with the tactical air com mand at Langley AFB in Virginia. While working at a NS A facility he was shown photographs taken by the Lunar Orbiter of the m oon that showed detailed artificial structures. These photos were taken prior to the Apollo landing in 1969. So I was asked to go over to this facility on Langley Air Force Base, where the NSA was bringing in the inform ation from the lunar orbiter ... As I walked in, there were people from other countries, a lot of foreign people from other countri es in civilian clothes, with interpreters with them , with security badges hanging around their neck. ... And they were very quiet, very reserved, and there was a very peculiar pall hanging over them . They had a very concerned dem eanor... We walked over to one side of the lab and he said, by the way , we’ ve discovered a base on the backside of the m oon. I said, whose? Wh at do you mean, whose? He said, y es, we’ve discovered a base on the backside of the moon. And at that point I becam e frightened and I was a little terrified, thinking to myself that if any body walks in the room now, I know we’re in jeopardy , we’ re in trouble, because he shoul dn’ t be giving m e this inform ation. I was fascinated by it, but I also knew that he was overstepping a boundary that he shouldn’ t. Then he pulled out one of these m osaics and show ed this base on the m oon, which had geom etric shapes- there were towers, there were spherical bu ildings, there were very tall towers and things that looked som ewhat like radar dishes but they were large structures... This fellow and I were the sam e rank; I think he was very distressed. He had the sam e pallor and dem eanor as the scientists outside the room ; th ey were just as concerned as he was. And he needed to discuss it with som ebody ... Som e of the structures are half a m ile in size. So they ’re huge structures. And they ’re all different sized structures in different photographs.

I knew the y oung fellow who was shar ing this was really , really overstepping his bounds at that point. I felt that he just needed som ebody to talk to . He hadn’ t discussed it, couldn’ t discuss it, and he wasn’t doing it for any ulterior motive other than the fact that I think he had the weight of this thing on him and it was distressing to him ... I knew that I couldn’ t go any place for at least five y ears without telling the State Departm ent where I was, after I left the m ilitary . [See the testimony of Merle Shane McDow and others who had similar restrictions. SG] Any tim e I traveled I had to notify and get perm ission, even in the United States. They had to know where I was all the tim e. As an exam ple, if we went to Vietnam there was alway s som eone there with us, with a gun, ready to annihilate us basically if we should fall into the hands of the enem y. They didn’t want the enem y to get us; we would be killed instead. So we knew we were operating under these sort of conditions. Your life was in jeopardy all the tim e, should y ou fall into the wrong hands. So we were aware of that. I was told when I left that I would be investigated on a regular basis to make sure that I wasn’t involved in any peculiar activities that didn’t suit the governm ent’s needs. ... Testim ony of Donna Hare Novem ber 2000 Donna Hare had a secret clearance while working for NASA contractor, Philco Ford. She testifies that she was shown a photo of a picture with a distinct UFO. Her colleague explained that it was his job to airbrush such evidence of UFOs out of photographs before they were released to the public. She also heard inform ation from other Johnson Space Center em ploy ees that som e astronauts had seen extraterrestrial craft and that when som e of them wanted to speak out about this they were threatened.

During the ‘70’s, I don’t know the exact date, I walked into the photo lab, into one of the restricted areas- I did have a secret clearance. I walked into a restricted area which was not m y com pany - it was the NASA photo lab.

And I said, this is really interesting. He explained every thing. And then, with a sm ile on his face he said, look over there. And I looked. And in one of the photo panels I saw a round white dot. And at the tim e it was very crisp, very sharp lines on it. And I said to him what is that? Is that a dot on the em ulsion? And then he’s grinning and he say s dots on the em ulsion don’t leave round shadows on the ground. And there was a round shadow at the correct angle with the sun shining on the trees.

They ’d signed papers not to talk. They would have their retir em ents taken away . I was just overwhelm ed with that piece of inform ation so I started asking questions. Certain people that I knew were key people in the organization so I’d take them away from the site. We’d go to lunch and I’d talk to them . And alone they would tell me things and then swear if I ever said they said it, they would say I was ly ing. One gentlem an that I knew very well was in quarantine with the astronauts. He said, just about every one of them has seen things when they went to the m oon. In fact, one said that craft were on the m oon at the tim e of the la nding.

He said, I used to work out there. And one da y som e soldiers cam e in fatigues and had m e burn pictures. He said that he was burning them and he was forced not to look at them . But he was tem pted. He looked at one of them and it was a UFO on the ground. Shortly thereafter he was hit in the head with a gun butt and he still had a scar on his forehead. Now, this gentlem an was terrified. He was scared out of his m ind. And he also said that in the picture was a UFO with little bum ps on it. It looked like it had just landed... There was a point in tim e when I had som e people com e out and tell m e I shouldn’t talk about this. They didn’ t threaten to kill m e but I got the message I shouldn’ t talk about it. But I’d already talked about it so much it didn’t really m atter any more. And like I said at the [ 1997] congressional briefings, I really started feeling lik e this topic was like sex.

He saw spy plane photos with clear UFOs in them JM: John May nard  SG: Dr. Steven Greer JM: My nam e’s John May nard. I’m a retired m ilitary intelligence analy st and retired in 1980. I was in the m ilitary for 21 y ears and st arted off with the Arm y Intelligence Security Agency as an analy st. I went on from there to wo rk for several different organizations with the military , and ended up with the DIA at the end of m y career, as an adm inistrator in charge of most of the docum ents for the Requirem ents and Evaluation division. As far as being aware of what was in the intelligence world regarding UFOs and Extraterrestrials, this cam e early on in m y career in the early 1960s. Som e of the radio com munications that I was analy zing for the Arm y Security Agency were a little bit m ore than just the norm al ty pe of traffic. I think at th at point when I becam e too curious is when they decided to let m e go from that position. I went on from there to investigate different aspects of what was going on with UFOs. When I got to Europe I was approached by a few of the counterintelligence people there that had inform ation on m y background as far as analy sis goes. I becam e involved in looking at where people were m oving drugs back and forth, as far as the m ilitary was concerned, and at the sam e tim e, I ran across the UFO problem s that people were having — particularly sightings in Europe. I did prelim inary investigations for these peopl e and turned reports in on what people were say ing; what was going on. But getting back to m y initial exposure to UF Os — — that was connected to work in Okinawa, where we were analy zing traffic patte rns [electronic com munications] of the Chinese at that particular tim e. Every once in a while, I would run across an anom aly that wasn’ t really within the pattern of the ty pe of traffic that would be known within our m ilitary network. When I questioned this, I would alway s be pushe d off to the side, and they would say , “Well, you don’t have to worry about things like that.” But I just couldn’t let it go — I still don’t. I pursue it to the ninth degree, without getting myself in trouble. But I did get in trouble that tim e. I found out that there was m ore to these com munications than was norm al, and that they were not basically Earthbound [ were not com ing from Earth] . And the further we dug into it, the m ore y ou noticed that it didn’t belong with the norm al traffic that was being broadcast. I couldn’ t trace any particular origin, and that’ s what got me really interested in where this was com ing from . Knowing a few friends that worked in the com munications departm ent, I sought their guidance on which way it was going. I guess that was my downfall, because they weren’ t quite as good friends as I thought they were.

And I said, ‘Is that a good sign or not?’ And he said, “No.” And in priv ate, very private talks, he adm itted that they were not Earthbound signals. We didn’ t really have a space program that woul d be m oving that kind of traffic, nor did we have the com munications sy stem s and satellites at that particular tim e that would ... I’m talking about the late 1950s, early 1960s. So as far as tim efram e goes, it had to be som ething else besides just us. Sputnik hadn’t been up that l ong and neither had the Am erican satellites. I think that that was really m y downfall — I rea lized it had to be extraterrestrial — so they found a way to get rid of m e and they did it very well. So any way, while in Europe I researched th ese UFO reports, and we got quite a bit of inform ation about the sightings. We would ge t drawings of what the vehicles looked like, whether they landed or not, whether they saw any people with them — extraterrestrials, things like that. And, it just m ade an exciting career fo r the next two y ears while I was over there. SG : And for whom were y ou m aking these reports during this tim e? JM : Basically they were going to the CIA, som e to the DIA, and som e to the Air Force, OSI — Office of Special Intelligence. What they were using the inform ation for, I never learned. There are several different projects that I ran acro ss later in m y years when I was in Turkey in the mid-1970s — 76, 77, [and] early 78, when I left. I was an adm inistrator and worked for NATO, Land Southeast Headquarters. I inquired with a couple of m y Turkish m ilitary friends, and finally got one general to actually adm it that there was UFO activity in this certain area of Turkey . He said, “Oh y eah, it’ s a great area if y ou want to see UFOs, I’ ll take y ou out there som e tim e.” Once, while in the Pentagon, I was sent to try and get som e files from Colonel Corso, and he made a com ment that was really funny at that particular point. I didn’t really connect it with any thing until later. He say s, “You have no idea at all what we’re about, do y ou?” And I told him , ‘No, sir, I don’t.’ He said, “Well, som e day the technology will be out there that has been totally back engineered.” It went right over m y head at that particular point, but I just told him yes, sir, and off I went like a good little privat e, where I was supposed to go. I didn’t tell any body what he had told m e. I just kept it in my mind. I reported back to m y superiors who had sent m e, that Colonel Corso prom ptly just dism issed m e from his office and I just left it at that. That happens all the tim e in the Pentagon. Mate rials are kept very tightly by the owners. Years later, while at the DIA, I saw som e docum ents that pertained to extraterrestrials. They were code-worded. A norm al person reading it may not catch it — it would go right on bey ond them . These were top secret docum ents. I im agin e m ost of them are still classified. A lot of them pertained to Salt 1 and Salt 2 — the strategic arm s lim itation treaties with Russia. I also saw pictures of UFOs from — I believe it was called — the National Intelligence Photographic Center [ NIPC] . Once in a while an anom aly would show up on the pictures that didn’t belong there — a round object, a triangular object. They were not m arkings put on the photograph that indicated som e place or any thing like that. These were above ground. These 296"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"anom alies cam e up in certain photographs and things that we received at our office at DIA and, we alway s thought they were interesting. They cam e from the NIPC, which I believe was the National Intelligence Photographic Center over on Hay es Street right there in Arlington. You knew that they were not part of som ething that was placed on the photograph, like a marker. It was not a norm al ty pe of object, particularly the oblong ones or the circles or the triangular ones — the triangles were kind of funny , with a rounded corner on the tail end of it. These were taken m ost generally with the Talent Key hole Satellites, and they would show these objects — these UFOs in them . They would be objects from the TK11, TK12 shots that were taken, that showed the anom alies. Som etim es y ou could actually track it photograph by photograph as it m oved across the [ sky ] — y ou knew that it m oved. I had a rather interesting incident, not in an or ganization that I belong to as far as the DIA, but it was an office put within m y area at DIA. Since it was in m y area of security , I received the code nam e to go in there and to look at the office. It was called Om ni Project...It dealt with radar satellites. I was talking with one of the sergeants over there in a little show room they had, and I noticed the satellite’s positioning. I said, “Now this is supposed to be a sy stem that tracks radar anom alies on Earth, right? ” He say s, “Yep, that’ s what it does.” So I ask, “Then why are half of them pointed towards outer space, towards the moon, towards areas that are just blank space?” I said, “At least half of those satellites that y ou got up there aren’ t looking at Earth — well what are they looking for?” He say s, “Well y ou got to have a need to know to know about that.” I said, “I see, in other words, who’ s com ing?” And he say s, “We don’ t know.” I just thought it rather odd that they were tracking stuff from outer space. I also did work with the Cam p David accord s and assigning the SR-71s, the Blackbird, to map the Sinai, and there were several reports at that particular tim e that the Blackbird had been accom panied by som ething that wasn’ t from this Earth. The photos of the Sinai would show anom alies that weren’t part of the terrain, were n’t part of the people, weren’t part of the atm osphere. In Intelligence, com partm entalization is probabl y the whole thing. There is a real big misnom er out here in the civilian world about classification. There are basically three classifications: confidential, secret, and top secret. And that’ s it. It doesn’ t go any higher than top secret. They com e up and they call about um bra and they call about this one, Om ni. They called about TK, Talent Key hole and other projects like that. Well, people have to realize that I had Eum bra docum ents that were only secret, not just top secret. It was not the sam e. I’ll get into the background of what Intelligence [does] , how they break things down: they keep pretty much each organization an island unto itself. You don’ t have cross- departm entalization a lot within the program s. Let’ s say I have an um bra clearance. Well, people say that’ s so high above top secret. No, it’ s not. It’ s a com partm ent — it is strictly a com partm ent — it’s not more. Top secret is as high as y ou go. Ultra is another com partm ent. That’ s som ething entirely different and has to do basically with the President. So you can’ t fool around with it. So that’s it. You have islands unto y ourself. Each one does [ its] own particular type of analy sis. The one that I worked for was called Requirem ents and Evaluations, at the DIA. We were the ones that m ade the determ ination to fly the birds out of Wallops Island or som ewhere else — to go up and put a satellite up. 297"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"We were DC3. There was a DC4, and there was a DC5. I would have to really dig back into my background papers to give y ou exact nam es for each one — that’ s how com partm entalized they becom e. One of them did strictly analy sis — that’s all they did, and they would feed it to us in Requirem ents. But, we didn’ t really see all of what they did, and didn’ t see all the m aterial they did. They gave us the finished product, and we would look at the finished product and make our determ inations of what we were going to do from there. That’ s basically the way it is. Om ni Project, which was the radar satellite — it was an island unto itself. If y ou didn’t have an Om ni stam p on y our badge, y ou didn’t get into their offi ce — period, end of subject. Sam e thing with people with TK or m any other things — Um bra, Ultra — sam e right on down the line. The NRO, National Reconnaissance Office, is basically run by the Air Force. The Reconnaissance Office, from m y understanding from pe ople that I’ ve had contacts with since I retired, has taken on a lot m ore responsibility — par ticularly towards the UFO and extraterrestrial activities. You could say that they picked up where Blue Book dropped off. Blue Book was basically an Air Force project for them selves, but tho se activities finally fell under the purview of the National Reconnaissance Office. Now it is basically a joint service, but it is run by the Air Force and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They have a very om inous job. Not too m uch is ever really known about exactly what they do, but they ’re running the successor to the SR-71, wh ich is supposed to be a Delta-ty pe aircraft capable of [ flying from ] Los Angeles to London in about 18 m inutes — so it goes near space. It’ s pretty quick. Satellite im agery has pretty m uch gone to the background. You’ve still got Talent Key hole. You’ve still got Om ni. They ’ve got a couple of others up there now that I don’t even know the code nam es for any more, but m ost of the Reconnaissance is done by aircraft. As far as anti gravity , they ’ve been working on it for a long, long tim e — I know that — but basically what I’ ve seen is the m agnetic pulse engine. It has a very unique signature when it flies. It has norm al ty pe fuel, but it also has a m agnetic pulse set up to it. The signature is like a soap- on-a-rope-ty pe of contrail behind it. A governm ent is widespread, as every body know s. It’s into every body ’s pockets and every body ’s life all over the place. The sam e thing holds true for the UFO/extraterrestrial subject, but very , very few people really [have] the full knowledge of what’s going on. It’s held very tightly within black covert operations. If y ou want to take a good close look at som e of the background on it, y ou can go to civilian organiza tions outside of NSA, which are direct contractors for NSA — like Dry don Industries. Why are they fly ing the SR-71 on Reconnaissance using Navy pilots? What are they looking at? What is NSA looking at, when you think about that? Why are they doing these particular things? They are not using it for training, that’s for one thing. Within the organization at the executive level, I would dare say that the National Security Advisor, when he com es on board, is fairly well treated as in-the-know from the top at NSA. His knowledge is still lim ited, because he’ s only an appointee, and at that particular point, a new appointee at the CIA is the sam e way . They will have knowledge, but very lim ited knowledge. Only som e people within the black c overt areas will have very specific inform ation about what’s going on. 298"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":" But, not very m uch is known about the NRO — it’s one of those organizations that’s so low profile...Any tim e the question com es up, it’ s stric tly an entity that does reconnaissance in the Air Force, period. It leaves a lot of questions. Bu t as far as UFO and intelligence and extraterrestrial matters go, it’s right at the top — and I would say that the President has lim ited knowledge of it. I know Carter did not have any knowledge whatsoever. And I worked right there with the organization, President Carter’ s organization. They kept it pretty secret. SG: Why do y ou think it’ s being kept so secret? JM: I think that they m ade a m istake at Roswe ll. Rather than adm itting it, they covered it, and they covered it because UFO and extraterrestri al activity has been going on a lot longer than this governm ent will adm it. I thought it was co mical the way Bush — George W. — threw the ball into Cheney ’s court say ing that, of any body who would probably know m ore about this than any body else, it would be Cheney . He has som e very interesting knowledge... Of corporations involved in this m atter, Atlantic Research Corporation is one of the big ones. It’s not very often heard about. It’s an insider beltway bandit, if you want to call it that — very low profile — m ostly has all of its work done within Intelligence. TRW, Johnson Controls, Honey well: all of them at som e point or another becam e involved with the Intelligence field. Certain works, activities were contracted out to them . Atlantic Research was one of them — way back. These are entities that were created out of people in the Pentagon to becom e a “beltway bandit”: [they ] received projects, grants, and m onies to do certain projects that were so highly classified and com partm entalized that y ou know only about four people would know what was going on. So it was that tightly controlled. You would have to look at corpor ations that were started by people who were retired from the military . Bobby Inm an and his little oversight group out there in California [ SAIC] , for exam ple. Som e other things like that. So we would ask th e question, who really is controlling JPL? Why was JPL started? Others: Am es Laboratories, Fort Detrick. Som e very interesting things com e out of Fort Detrick. And Harry Diam ond Laboratories...been around for a long, long tim e. Don’ t hear m uch about them , because they ’re all b asically m ilitary contracted, and they are in a particular specialty . I don’ t know if you’ ve ever seen any back engineering notes — how they do it and stuff like that. Very unique. You can get an engineer to tell y ou how they do it, and the specific notes that you do. You take it forward from som ebody ’s notes, and y ou can build the item — just from the back engineering notes. Got to take it apart to find out how it works. I can think of som e stuff that we’ve gotten out of Roswell. There was also a crash up in Canada in the m id-50s that was kept very , ve ry hush, hush. There were definitely som e engineering projects dealing with those things. About weapons and space: I think that we can go back to a com ment that was made by one of the astronauts when he stepped on the m oon. It was the day after they got there, and it was the original flight, and he say s, ‘”You’re right, they ’re already here.” It got out on the airwaves. I know several people who recorded it. But the rem ark was very unique, because it was quickly taken out of all other tapes that were public br oadcast. Weapons in space is still a big enigm a. Black covert operations have alway s been try ing to do som ething like that, basically . Star Wars was a big boondoggle. Most of it didn’ t exist. It was just all on paper. Laser weapons...well, 299"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"that’s a whole different story . There are brand new leaps and bounds that have been m ade in the laser field. Not only cutting, but pulsed lasers that basically destroy s any thing it hits. SG: Do y ou think then that we have weapons in space? JM: I’ m sure we have weapons in space. Ther e is probably no doubt in m y mind about it. They were try ing to develop them long before St ar Wars becam e an entity , back in the late 60s, early 70s. Nixon wanted som ething along that line to produce weapons for space. The project started then. (Not Nixon per se, the individual him self, but in his adm inistration.) People wanted it done. There was a fear then of som ething out th ere. That was when the first stories cam e out about the asteroids im pacting the Earth, and it really didn’t becom e a heavy project until very recently , but apparently we had som e rather close calls back then — a — lot closer than what they call a close call today . So it becam e a very big concern — asteroids, UFOs, people com ing from other places. [See the testimony of Dr. Carol Rosin.] Concepts were there. Ideas were there. Para noia was also there within the governm ent. At certain levels y ou could feel it. You knew it was happening. Would they tell the truth about it? I doubt it. May be som e year. May be your project will tell them . Britain and the United States and Canada were the biggest party to these secrets. They got the Australians involved with it later on. The m edia is very one-sided when it com es to reporting. They don’t step on the other person’ s toes when it com es to things that would be controversial — like UFOs and extraterrestrials. There have been too m any si ghtings that have hit the m ainstream m edia, but they die very quickly . Why do they die? There was m ore interest going on for the m edia to follow up on, but they just flat refuse to do it. Why did they ? Were they pulled by strings from behind? I don’t know. I can’t say . And they ’re not say ing either... It goes right back to the sam e thing with these beltway bandits. Can y ou get them to say som ething? No. That’ s where their bread and butter is. They ’re not going to step on their own toes, punch them selves in the face. The truth is they have hidden things like UFOs and extraterrestrial inform ation from us for years — not just the current era, but back before the 1900s. So it’s there. It’s about tim e for them to just com e forward and say , hey , this is it. Testim ony of Mr. Harland Bentley August 2000 Mr. Bentley has been involved in working on classified projects with several Governm ent agencies including NASA and the DOE.

Mr. Bentley recounts a story of personally witnessing a UFO crash at a Nike Ajax Missile Facility in Mary land and viewing a group of UFO’s on radar take off at a cal culated 17,000 m iles an hour after having hovered on the ground. He also speaks of a 1967/68 incident where he overheard a conversation between Houston Control and ast ronauts in flight talk about avoiding a collision with a UFO spacecraft and our astronauts actually seeing living beings m oving about through portals on the UFO. 300"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":" In 1957 to 1959, I was outside of Olney , Mary land, just north of Washington, D.C. at a Nike Ajax Missile Facility . I was a radar operator. In May of 1958, at about 6:00 a.m . I first heard a sound that sounded like a pulsating transform er. I looked out the window and looked across the field and saw this [ disc shaped] object heading to ward the ground and saw it crash. It broke apart and then it took off again in flight... The largest piece that I saw was actually glowing white hot and was probably the size of a washing m achine... When the craft took off again after it crashed, it went through a grove of trees and actually sheered three, four or five inch lim bs, in just one fell swoop, like a knife or a m achete... [Note the resemblance to the crash of an extrat errestrial vehicle in Peru in 1997 as recounted by Lance Cpl. John W eygandt. SG] The real exciting part happened the next eveni ng while I was on duty . It was approxim ately 10:00 or 11:00 at night and I got a call from the Ga ithersburg facility say ing that they had twelve to fifteen UFOs, 50-100 feet off the ground. So I asked the guy who was on the radio with m e, “What do they sound like?” He took his head m ike off, put it out the van window and again the pulsating sound except there were m ore of them . He was describing them in different shapes and so forth. I had the radar on, the M-33 sweep radar, and right next to the ground clutter where Gaithersburg sits, we found the blip where these vehi cles were. Then all of a sudden they all took off at the sam e tim e. From m y radarscope, it went in one sweep. It is a thirty -three and a third RPM. To go that distance from the center out to wh ere I got the next blip in the first sweep, at a constant velocity would have to be 17,000 m iles an hour which we calculated from our analog com puter... I had another one, which I can’t say too m uch about. I can’t say where I was. I was at a facility in California, that is all I can say , and I was doing particular classified work. The only thing that I can say is that it was occurring at the sam e tim e that our astronauts were doing a loop around the m oon and back again. On their trip to the m oon itself I heard them say they had a bogey (term used for unknown target, and often specifically used to denote a UFO) com ing in at 11:00. Well, fam iliar with that particular term , I perked m y ears up and started listening and discovered that Houston and the astronauts were talking back and forth about a collision. The astronauts asked for perm ission to do avoidance fo r a collision and Houston finally granted that perm ission to do that. Later the astronauts said, “It is not necessary . They are now paralleling our course” and there was a discussion as to what was paralleling that course. It was another ty pe of ship. There were portals there that they could see in. They could see beings of som e sort. They did not describe th ese beings. They just took photographs. And after a while, a few thousand m iles, they [the bogey ] took off from the capsule that they were fly ing in and went away . They just said it was a saucer shaped craft. It was actually paralleling their craft. They saw m ovem ent. They saw som ething or so mebody m oving inside that ship. This happened before the lunar landing. ... Then they said, “The re they go.” And they [the bogey ] went out of sight alm ost im mediately , from what I could gather from their conversation. This event was unedited because of where I was [a secret listening post] . It was an extrem ely restricted channel... Ther e was only one gentlem an there with m e when this happened. He said som ething like, “You didn’t hear any thing.” And I said, “hear what?” 301"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"And that was the end of that.

He was a Senior Policy Analy st at the Center for the Study of Social Policy at Stanford Research Institute. In 1977 he worked on the Carter White House Extraterrestrial Com munication Project through SRI. Its purpose was to gain knowledge on the subject then m ake policy recom mendations. NASA director Jam es Fletcher and the National Science Foundation were involved.

I worked on the 1977 Carter White House Extraterrestrial Com munication Project... When [ Carter] entered the White House in Janua ry of 1977, I was also entering the Center for the Study of Social Policy at SRI. In the inte rview process I declared explicitly that I would like to do an extra-terrestrial com munication project at the Center. I was brought on with that explicit agreem ent and I went about making inquiries as to who on the White House staff was interested in the subject m atter. I contacted that person and set up appointm ents with a basic outline of an extra-terrestrial project. So, this project was undertaken openly and was of a civilian nature with transparency - there were no classified aspects. It started at Stanfo rd Research Institute in m y offices...Once a final report was issued under the proposal it would be a White House docum ent and would com e out under their agency and their policy recom mendations. NASA was one of the agencies with which we would work on a contract level. I have direct inform ation from then NASA personnel that the pr oposal was at the Office of the Director, Jam es Fletcher, who had it in his possession at the tim e. The National Science Foundation was also to be part of that proposal in term s of being able to work with a National Science Board and a Board of Advisors who would vet the research. 302"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"The full m anagem ent staff and the research institute had signed off knowingly on the proposal at the Center for the Study of Social Policy at SRI.

This project lasted from May 1977 when the initia l contacts were m ade with the White House until 1977 when it was term inated by intervention from the Pentagon. The goal of the study was to fill the knowledge gap on this subject and make policy recom mendations for the future... The proposal was known and approved within the Dom estic Policy Staff of the White House and was in circulation with the White House Scie nce Advisors Office. Those were the agencies nam ed in the proposal. It was through the White House Dom estic Policy Staff, under Stewart Eisenstatt, that we had the initial contact. I visited the Carter White House every 20 day s and met with White House staff every 2-3 weeks developing the proposal to the sole- source contract stage during the period of May to Septem ber of 1977. My meetings were at the White House in the Execu tive Office Building with White House Staff from the Dom estic Policy Staff... I flew back from m y m eeting with the White House at which this final approval had been given and when I arrived back at m y offices at SR I I was called back into the office of the Senior SRI Official. He was an African-Am erican and I referred to him in m y sworn affidavit as John Doe. The other person in this prelim inary m eeting was Peter Schwartz who was based in the sam e office as m yself and was an advisor to the project . The Senior SRI Official stated to m e that in a few m inutes a second person, who was the SR I Pentagon Liaison would be com ing in. The project was to be term inated. They had received direct com munications from the Pentagon that if the study went forward, SRI’s c ontracts with the Pentagon would be term inated. These contracts were a substantial part of SRI’ s business at the tim e in term s of studies, monies, missile research contracts, and other contracts. The Senior Official advised m e, and I am quoting him , “To dissim ulate” and to just pretend I was going along with it- im ply ing that I would keep my job if I did so. What happened then was that the SRI Pentagon Liaison whom I call in m y sworn affidavit John Doe II cam e in and he stated that unless this project were term inated, SRI’ s contract research with the Pentagon would be term inated. He stated then that the project was term inated, the project that had just been approved by the White House, was term inated because, and I am quoting him , “There are no UFO’s.” At that point, I vociferously objected. I recited baseline data that UFO’s did exist. It was to no avail. The Senior Official sided with the Pentagon person and the project was term inated. To my knowledge, SRI does not have a practice - and there is no case - of their canceling a project after explicit approval by the White House. Quite the contrary , they are extrem ely hungry for research dollars and when the White House approves a project, m eaning that it is m ost certainly going to be funded by the line agencies, they would lunge after it...I felt that the whole term ination of the project was, in itself, a covert operation...

She elucidates how “black” budget m onies are hidden in seem ingly legitim ate projects. A pattern of sexual harassm ent began after she brought this issue before a supervisor. ...Well, I opened up the files and there were onl y form letters, m aybe two or three, and y et these contracts were several y ears old. And eve the letters that were in there were back dated several y ears, say ing the sam e exact form letter: “It’s being worked on, blah, blah, blah.” And it was talking about som etim es m illions of dollars in contracts... It seem ed like there were all those different cont racts that needed to be updated, but there was nothing to back it up. There was no activity on it, and that struck m e as very odd... I thought, “This is just the weirdest run place I have ever seen. How do they do business? How do they get these m illion dollar contracts when things are so disorganized and nobody seem s to be doing any thing” – and I thought, “Nothing seem s real around here.” It’ s just like there’ s four walls. We’re sitting in a very plush, very expensive building. I don’t have any thing to do. I don’t even sharpen pencils. This is crazy .

SAIC has a very perfect situation to do any ty pe of research they want to under the guise of any thing — and call it what they want. And they definitely aren’t working alone in any thing. They are what’s called a conglom erate. There is SAIC, but it’s m ade up of num erous individual corporations... And since it’s privately owned corporations, the only people they would have to report to is the ones who they ’re doing business with and are contracting with. And so if the people they are contracting with wish to do som ething that m aybe isn’t in the best interests of every one, nobody is getting to know about it. It’s all kept in-house: the funding, the financing, the contracts. There should be files. There should be docum entation a nd a regular tim eline of events on every project, which did not exist whatsoever. And if I’ m working in a m ilitary division and I have access to all of the files, where was this docum entation? So it m ade m e very suspicious of where al this money was going...

He said he was sure money was going into UFO – related projects but they could not penetrate them. I remember he said, “SG, you are dealing with the Varsity Team of all black projects – good luck...” I should also comment on the weird atmos phere and sexual abuse Ms. McKenzie describes: This is common, not rare, in such operations. As she said, it takes on an unreal feeling. Even the story of her recruiter/supervisor having a diff erent first name and being allegedly dead years before is a common pattern. People disappear from one project, allegedly are dead, and reappear in another super-secret operation with a different name or at least a different first name, as Dr. B points out in this testimony. Essen tially SAIC is one of the crown jewels of the super-secret, black project world and is connected to UFO technologies and covert funding. Former NSA head Adm. Bobby Inman is heavily involved with SAIC, it should be noted. Here again, we see the revolving door between military and corporate projects described by Dr. Rosin . After meeting with Senator Barry Goldwater in 1994, I asked the Senator to get Adm. Inman’s cooperation with disclosure. He rebuffed Senator Goldwater at that time.

[Our deepest gratitude to Jam es Fox for sharing this interview] Colonel Phillip Corso, Sr. was an Arm y intelligence officer who served on Eisenhower’s National Security Council. After his 21 year military career he served as a m ilitary analy st. Colonel Corso persona lly saw deceased extraterrestrials from the Roswell crash in 1947 and a UFO craft at an ai rbase. He had also seen UFOs travel at 4,000 miles an hour on radar. When he wo rked in R&D he was given fragm ents of extraterrestrial technologies from various crashes and his job was to seed industry with these technologies telling them they were from Earthly foreign sources. These ET’ s are another intelligence, they are ahead of us and they ’ve proven it- for one sim ple reason – they can travel through space and we can’ t. It boils down to that sim ple. How are y ou going to overcom e that? We don’t know any thing about that so we have to start with what we know. The little we know is the greatest gift they gave us – the extraterrestrial not the hardware. The one craft I saw was at one of the airbases. I’ m not going to say where it was but it was there and that was it. I didn’ t go in it. I had a lot of inform ation on what was inside. There was nothing I could gain by going inside and looking at it. I had the dr awings of how it looked inside. I had what was in there. Really to go in it woul d have been curiosity and those day s I didn’t have the tim e for curiosity . The extraterrestrial, he’s a little different. He’s com posed in a way of cells also like hum ans are. And the craft is really alm ost a biological type of structure because the extraterrestrial fits in it. Rem ember these cloners that m ade these beings made them in a way where they would fit in what they wanted to fit in.

Since he doesn’t speak, he has no vocal chords, he will have som ething that intensifies a transm ission so he can com municate. ... I’ll go through that story now. I wasn’t at Roswe ll in ‘47. In ‘47 I had just com e back from Italy where I had been Chief of Security in Intelligence in Rom e and in the Intelligence business I was trained really by the British. I was an MI- 19. When I cam e back, I went to Fort Riley , Kansas. I was stationed there. I was an inst ructor at the Intelligence school and we had an aggressor force. One night I was first duty officer. First duty officer m eans that I was in control for that night and I checked all the guards, a ll security areas - I checked the whole post. So I went to the veterinarian section and a ser geant I knew very well was the sergeant of the guards that night. I told him , “Sarge, how is every thing around here?” He said, “fine Sir.” I told him , “they told m e to be careful, to watch this area because y ou have som ething sensitive here.” He said, “y ou want to see it Sir?” I told him , “y eah.” He said, “just go look.” I knew the Master Sergeant. I went back and there were 5 crates there, 5 or 6, but I think it was 5. I lifted one up and here’ s this body floating in fluid. I looked at it for about 10-15 seconds, not m uch m ore than that, so I put it back down and said, “Sarge, get out of here now, I don’t want to get y ou in trouble. I’m the duty officer I can walk around here but y ou m ight get in trouble for com ing back here. Com e out with m e.” We went out and I told him, “where’ d they com e from Sarge? ” He said, “well 5 trucks have been com ing through here fro m New Mexico and they ’re heading for Wright Patterson Air Force base.” Now in those day s Route 40 was about the only cross-country route and the route that they took was Route 40 going through Fort Riley , Kansas a nd then to Wright Patterson Air Force. So I say , “stay away from it Sarge I don’t want y ou to get in any trouble.” I told him , “I can walk around.” So then I started to figure what was that? First, I thought it was a child because it was sm all, then I looked at its head and all, and th is only happened in a m atter of seconds, then I put the end back down. The head was different, the arm s were thin, the body was gray , so right at that m oment I figured I don’ t know what this thi ng is. So in the Intelligence business I better just put it in the back of m y head and wait in the futu re to see if I get corroboration so I can evaluate what it is. I prom ptly forgot about it. Ten years later, I was down near Com mando Range [sp] in New Mexico, in White Sands at the Arm y & Missile firing range, right near Trinity site, m y headquarters. On m y own radar, I started picking up item s going 3,000-4,000 m iles an hour in this area. I had pencil-beam radar which locked on the target and the boy s told m e these objects were going about 3,000 to 4,000 miles an hour. Once I notified headquarters. They said, “forget it - we’re not interested.” So I figured I won’t tell them any thing any more. Every tim e that would happen I would tell the boy s, “bring me the tapes.” All m y com puters had a tape, wh ich gave the whole firing sequence and we could check it if any thing went wrong. So I told th em , “deliver the tapes to m e, personally .” 310"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"Then I left and went to Germ any and I started picking up the sam e things in Germ any - 3,000-4,000 m iles per hour fly ing over Germ any . Again, the pencil-beam radar would lock on and all the ones [ UFOs] that we would lock on would break loose. Then, I was four y ears at the White House and I kept getting reports there but they were just reports. I had all the clearances so I’ d get them , even code reports I’ d get. I did get one tim e a report that NSA was getting signals from space, wh ich were not just space noise, or unscram bled, or som ething y ou couldn’t read- they were rea lly very perfect and looked like som ething was guiding a real m essage. But we were never able to decode it. This was a very coordinated message. It wasn’ t space noise or jum bo m umbo or any thing like that or just noise com ing. [See the testimony of John M aynard and A.H. SG] It was a pattern. The evaluation was that it m ight be com ing from outer space beings and I got that report at the White House because I had the NSA clearances and all. Then I cam e back and General Trudeau pulled m e in. He had or ganized a Research & Developm ent project from a secondary ... At first, when I reported in I was a special assistant. Then he created the Foreign Technology Division about a week later and put m e in charge of it. There I started getting the autopsy reports of ET’s, and I started getting other crash reports and the artifacts from the crashes. And I visited the site here [ near Roswell New Mexico] a couple of tim es. ... When I cam e into Research & Developm ent, I inherited all these artifacts and I inherited autopsy reports from Walter Reed Hospital. Now at Walter Reed there is a laboratory there, which was our laboratory that we financed. That is who did the autopsies for us. But we didn’t leave any copies there. All copies had to com e back to us because it was our lab - we financed it all. So there we started getting proof that a crash really happened here. Of course, I kept it quiet for 35 y ears I had an oath with the General and I didn’t reveal nam es of peoples. My son said, “35 y ears y ou kept a secr et and didn’ t even tell y our fam ily .” I thought, “why should I tell any body ?” Now the General told m e and said, “so let’ s keep a secret, but when I die I relieve y ou of m y oath.” Three y ears ago the General died and I started putting all this on paper. My grandchildren said, “what did y ou do during the war?” I thought I better leave them a legacy . I had no intention of writing a book, being in the m ilitary . But fina lly , it evolved and I gradually started to write and it evolved into this. So that is m y backgr ound and as I said I had the evidence that a crash did happen here. Wilbert Sm ith was a genius and the governm ent really treated him badly .

If a Prisoner of War is m issing from fam ilies, they don’t care. And the cover up happens like that som etim es with nobody doing any thing- it will cover itself up and fall through the cracks as I put it.

That order went out and we knew that in Special Intelligence (that I was in the Pentagon) th e KGB tried to penetrate that but they never did. We knew that Stalin sent agents out all over this area here to try to get inform ation on Roswell and yet we stood back like fools and said it didn’t exist - we said it was a weather balloon. They didn’ t think it was a weather balloon because they had indications that this event was happening. [See also the testimony of Gordon Creighton.

Later I got m y hands on the autopsy report in 1961, when I took charge of the Foreign Technology Division, from Walter Reed Hospital. From there, I started putting it all together. The nature of the body inside was described in the autopsy report. They did an autopsy and they cut open the brain and all. The brain was differe nt, and m ost of the body was different – no nose, no m outh, no ears, no vocal cords, no digestive system , no sex organs. So, then we cam e to the conclusion that it was a hum anoid clone. As I say , when I saw the body , there was nothing to go on. Later on, I got the autopsy reports th at experts had done, our own experts. But we kept it to ourselves- only certain people kne w about it, head to head, brain to brain, no paper trail.

Testim ony of Dr. Roberto Pinotti Septem ber 2000 In his testim ony , Mr. Pinotti speaks about the 215 inexplicable UFO events in the Italian Air Force files. He obtained official Italian docum ents that date back to the 30’s, specifically 1936 where the then Fascist Governm ent was handling and docum enting UFO sightings. Mussolini was very concerned about these unexplained craft because of the effect they might have on the Italian Ai r Force. The docum ents talk about elongated craft expelling sm aller fly ing-saucer ty pe UFO’s. One sighting happened over the skies of Venice. The Air Force attem pted to intercept these craft but could not as they were too fast. Recently the Chief of the Intelligen ce Office of the Italian Air Force, General Olivero, spoke about this subject say ing that the problem of UFO’s exists and that the Air Force has been dealing with it since 1978. There were even two landing traces in Cam pagna near Naples where the soil was bom barded with high intensity , high frequency microwaves. There was another im portant event docum ented by Air Force General Salvatore Marcholetti in 1976 where, in Lechi, he was fly ing and cam e across a huge green object that appeared over his plane. Soon the UFO took off at trem endous speed. ...From the standpoint of the nature of the sigh tings, the Air Force docum ents show that we are facing definite real objects and that these objects are detected by radar.

For instance, there are cases of m ilitary planes attem pting to intercept these objects in the skies of Italy . But these objects go away without the possibility of being intercepted... Recently , we had an Italian Air Force officer sp eak officially and in uniform about the UFO issue. The speaker was General Olivero. He’s the chief of the intelligence office of the Italian Air Force, which is in charge of following the UF O cases. He said that the problem exists and the Italian force is handling this difficult issue since 1978. He said that they have on file at least 215 UFO cases, and that really there are inexplicable cases. He was also asked officially by the press what he thought on a personal basis. He said that , since he’s a pilot, he knows serious colleagues and serious pilots who have re lated encounters with UFOs, and he said, I trust them . In the ‘90s we had two landing cases in Italy and both occurred in Cam pagna -- Cam pagna is the region near Naples. The landing traces left by these two different objects were analy zed in a laboratory by our experts. We got specific resu lts. We discovered that the objects, after their landing, had really bom barded the surface of the soil with high intensity , high frequency microwaves. We could check and define this e ffect. We then com pared these results with the world fam ous case of Trans en Provence in Fran ce, which occurred in 1981 and which is a classic from this point of view. It was very im portant because when we went to Toulouse we found that the data we saw from these cases were really sim ilar in effect. This was very , very im portant. We have a good relationship with the French governm ental body which researches UFO m atters in France. Monsieur Valesco is the head of the governm ental body who studies the UFO problem in France. The French, they think that the problem is real , that we are confronting a real phenom enon, a technological phenom enon of unknown nature. The pos ition of the French is extrem ely open and extrem ely realistic... Another im portant case was the case of an Air Fo rce general - he is retired now - General Salvatore Marcholetti, in 1976. When he was the chief of the flight school of the Italian Air Force in Lechi, he happened to meet a trem endous object during a flight. He was fly ing and he suddenly saw this green object over him - over the cockpit. He understood that som ething enorm ous, huge, was over the plane. He didn’t know what to do. Seconds later, m inutes later - he still doesn ’t know how long this experience lasted - he suddenly saw this m ass take off with trem endous speed. Only after he left the Italian Air Force did he m entioned this event... From a logical point of view, I don’ t think that we have any thing to fear because if we were facing hostile beings, surely they would have conquered us or m ade incredible things happen in the past -- they could really . If this hasn’ t happen, surely it is because we haven’ t nothing to fear. Probably there are, in every part of the world, invisible links with a definite invisible college that is keeping this secret. They are dealing with this subject from the standpoint of research secretly in order to have gains and technologi es to be applied in a various way s. The UFO problem is not only a scientific problem , it is also an intelligence problem . This is the second im portant face of the UFO reality .

I work principally as a conceptual artist. Most of my clients are in the defense industry . I occasionally work directly for the m ilitary , but m ost the tim e I work for civilian corporations that are defense contractors and build weapons sy stem s and things for the m ilitary . I’ve worked for all the m ajor defense contractors: General Dy nam ics, Lockheed, Northrop, McDonald-Douglas, Boeing, Rockwell International, Honey well, and Allied Signet Corporation. In 1967 when I was at Westover Air Force Base, one night before going to bed I saw this light moving across the sky ; then it just kind of stopped, and there wasn’t any noise. I took the dog back in the house, and I brought out m y te lescope and watched this thing through the telescope for about ten m inutes. In fact, it was hovering directly over the facility where they kept the nuclear weapons — at the storage facility near the alert hangers at Westover Air Force Base. It started to m ove off, and it m oved off slowly and kind of wandered around the sky . Then, all of a sudden it was gone, like it had been fired out of a gun. It was out of sight in just a second or two. Well, it all started com ing together when I w as working at IntroVision, and John Eppolito talked about this interview that he had done with a person who had, for som e reason, wound up walking up to, or near a hangar at a section of a m ilitary Air Force base. [He] had seen a fly ing saucer in a hangar, and then he was arrested — haul ed off, blindfolded, and debriefed — this sort of thing. Then I learned that this fellow, Mark Stam bough, had developed an experim ent that created a kind of levitation. In som e circl es it’s been called electrogravitic levitation, or antigravity . What he did, apparently , was acquire a high voltage power source — a DC (direct current) power source, and he took a couple of quarter-inc h-thick copper plates about a foot in diam eter, with a lead com ing out of the m iddle of each one at the top and the bottom . [Then] , he basically em bedded them in a ty pe of plastic resin like pol ycarbonate or Plexiglas, or som e other kind of clear resin where you could see the plates, and y ou could see the m aterial. Apparently , he did every thing he could to get all the little air bubbles a nd stuff out of there, so there wouldn’t be any pathway s for the electricity to break down the m aterial and arc through them . The experim ent was to see how m uch voltage y ou could put on this capacitor — the sub-plate capacitor — in this arrangem ent; how m uch voltage could y ou put on this thing before the insulating m aterial begins to just break down? 323"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"Well, he got up to about a m illion volts, and the thing would begin to float, and it floated in accordance with principles that had been described in a patent that was filed back in the late 1950s/early 1960s by a gentlem an called Thom as Townsend Brown. Brown and another individual by the nam e of Dr. Biefield had done this, so this effect becam e known as the Biefield- Brown effect. Well, [ Stam bough] apparently dup licated the experim ents done by Biefield and Brown, [ and] the one aspect they found about this arrangem ent was that the levitation or movem ent would occur in the direction of the positiv ely -charged plate. So, if y ou had two plates, one is negative, and one is positive because of the direct current sy stem . If y ou have the positive plate on top, it would m ove in that direction. If y ou had it on a pendulum , it would alway s swing in whatever direction the positive plate was facing. Later, I got a call from a kid that I had known in school, a fellow by the nam e of Brad Sorensen. He apparently had recognized m y nam e [from som e work I had done in a m agazine] , and had contacted the art director who gave hi m my phone num ber, and he called m e up. It turned out that he had gone to work for a desi gn firm in the Glendale/Pasadena area of California and ultim ately wound up acquiring m ost of the clientele for this particular agency . In the process, he developed a business practi ce where he would create conceptual designs and products for different clients. The way he st ructured his business [ was to] set it up so that if he cam e up with som e new and novel design, som ething that was patentable, the client would pay to have the patent secured. Then he would agr ee, if the patent was in his nam e, to license it exclusively to them and no one else, and they woul d pay him roy alties. So, he got his clients to pay for all these patents, and he had all these royalties com ing in, and he was a m illionaire before 30. So, this is Brad Sorensen com ing back to me eight y ears after school, and we’re talking, and he’ s telling me all these interesting stories. There was an air show that was com ing up at Norton Air Force Base, which used to be an active Air Force base right on the eastern fringe of San Bernardino in Southern California. I suggested that we get together and go to this air show. I had heard that they were going to have a fly -by (a fly ing dem onstration) by the SR-71 Blackbird, and he seem ed to know a lot about it, so I said, well, let’s do that. It turned out [ that] at the last m inute, the m agazine Popular Science cam e back again and [told m e] they had som e really , really crazy deadline for another illustration, and they wanted to know if I could do it over the weekend, so I had to beg off on this air show. Brad had already m ade arrangem ents to go, and he was going to bring one of his clients with him . It turned out that this client was a tall, thin, white-haired m an with glasses [and] an Italian- sounding last nam e. He was already a m illionaire in his own right and was in civilian life again after having been either a Secretary of Defense or an Under-Secretary of Defense. Brad wanted me to m eet this gentlem an, and if I had known this at the tim e, I probably would have told the magazine to wait, because I had no idea at that point what I was going to be m issing out on. Believe m e, I’ ve kicked m yself ever since, because the following week, after Brad got back hom e, he called m e up and told m e about the air show . He told m e about what he had seen there: apparently , right about the tim e the Air Force fl ying dem onstration team , the Thunderbirds, were planning to begin their show, this gentlem an that Brad was with said, “Follow m e,” and they [went] walking down to the other end of the airfi eld, away from where the crowds were, to this huge hangar that’ s at Norton Air Force Base.

It looks like four giant Quonset hut sty le hangars that are all connected in the m iddle, w ith shops and work areas out around the edges, and there is sort of a divider in the m iddle. [See the testimony of Lieutenant Colonel John Williams. SG] This gentlem an took Brad down there. He said, “I’m here to talk to the guy who is running the show,” so the guard goes in and out com es the sam e guard with a gentlem an in a three-piece suit, who im mediately recognizes this fellow that Br ad is with: this fellow whom I speculate was probably Frank Carlucci. They go inside, and im mediately after getting inside the door, this fellow apparently passes Brad off as his aide to this fellow who is m anaging the exhibit that’ s going on inside this hangar. This exhibit is for som e of the local politicians who are cleared for high security inform ation, [plus] som e of the local m ilitary officials. Well, as soon as they walk in, Brad is told by th is fellow that he is with, “There are a lot of things in here that I didn’t expect they we re going to have on display — stuff y ou probably shouldn’ t be seeing. So, don’ t talk to any body , don’ t ask any questions, just keep your mouth shut, sm ile and nod, but don’t say any thing — just enjoy the show. We’re going to get out of here as soon as we can.” In the process, the host or the person running th e show was very engaging with the gentlem an that Brad was with, so they bring them in, and they are showing them every thing. There was the losing prototy pe from the B-2 Stealth Bom ber com petition. They also had what was called the Lockheed Pulsar, nicknam ed the Aurora. These things had the ability to be just about any where in the world 30 minutes after launch, with the capability of 121 nuclear warheads — you know, probably 10-15 m egaton weapons — a tactical ty pe nuclear reentry vehicle. So, getting back to Brad’ s story at Norton Air Force Base: one of the other things he said was that after they showed them all of these aircra ft, they had a big black curtain that divided the hangar into two different areas. Behind these curtai ns was another big area, and inside this area they had all the lights turned off; so, they go in and they turn the lights on, and here are three fly ing saucers floating off the floor — no cables suspended from the ceiling holding them up, no landing gear underneath — just floating, hovering above the floor. They had little exhibits with a videotape running, showing the sm allest of the three vehicles sitting out in the desert, presum ably over a dry lakebed — som eplace like Area 51. It showed this vehicle m aking three little quick, hopping m otions; then [ it] accelerated straight up and out of sight, com pletely disappearing from view in just a couple of seconds — no sound, no sonic boom — nothing. They had a cut-away illustration, pretty m uch like the one I’ll show y ou in a little bit, that showed what the internal com ponents of this vehi cle were, and they had som e of the panels taken off so y ou could actually look in and see oxy gen tanks and a little robotic arm that could extend out from the side of the vehicle for collecting sam ples and things. So, obviously , this is a vehicle that not only is capable of fly ing around through the atm osphere, but it’s also capable of going out to space and collecting sam ples, and it’ s using a type of propulsion system that doesn’ t make any noise. As far as he could see, it had no moving parts and didn’ t have any exhaust gases or fuel to be expended — it was just there hovering. So, he listened intently and collected as m uch inform ation as he could, and when he cam e back, he told m e how he had seen these three fl ying saucers in this hangar at Norton Air Force 325"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"Base on Novem ber 12, 1988 — it was a Saturday . He said that the sm allest was som ewhat bell- shaped. They were all identical in shape and proportion, except that there were three different sizes. The sm allest, at its widest part, was fl at on the bottom , som ewhat bell-shaped, and had a dom e or a half of a sphere on top. The sides were sloping at about a 35-degree angle from pure vertical. The panels that were around the skirt had been rem oved, so he could see one of these big oxy gen tanks inside. He was very specific in describing the oxy gen tanks as being about 16 to 18 inches in diam eter, about 6 feet long, and they were all radially -oriented, like the spokes of a wheel. This dom e that was visible on the top w as actually the upper half of a big sphere-shaped crew com partm ent that was in the m iddle of the vehicle, and around the m iddle of this vehicle was actually a large plastic casting that had this big set of copper coils in it. He said it was about 18 inches wide at the top, and about 8 to 9 inches thick. It had maybe 15 to 20 stacked lay ers of copper coils inside of it. The bottom of the vehicle was about 11 or 12 in ches thick. In both cases, the coil and this large disc at the bottom were like a big plastic casting — sort of a greenish-blue, clear plastic, or it m ight have been glass. I determ ined, using my conceptual artist skills, that there were exactly 48 sections like thin slices of pizza pie, and each section within this casting probably weighed four or five tons, judging by the thickness and th e diam eter. It must have been m onstrous in weight. It was full of half-inch-thick copper plates, and each of the 48 sections had 8 copper plates. So, here we are back to the plate capacitors again, and the prospect of som eone finding a way to use the Biefield-Brown effect — this levita tion effect where y ou charge a capacitor to lift towards a positive plate. Now, when y ou’ve got eight plates stacked up in there, they alternate. It goes: negative positive, negative, positive, nega tive, positive — four tim es, so you ultim ately wind up with the positive plates alway s being above a set of negative plates as y ou go up. On the inside of the crew com partm ent was a big colum n that ran down through the m iddle, and there were four ejection seats m ounted back-to- back on the upper half of this colum n. Then, right in the m iddle of the colum n, was a large fly wheel of som e kind. Well, this craft was what they called the A lien Reproduction Vehicle; it was also nicknam ed the Flux Liner. This antigravity propulsion system — this fly ing saucer — was one of three that were in this hangar at Norton Air Force Base. [Its] sy nthetic vision sy stem [used] the sam e kind of technology as the gun slaving sy stem they have in the Apache helicopter: if [ the pilot] wants to look behind him , he can pick a view in that direction, and the cam eras slew in pairs. [The pilot] has a little screen in front of his helm et, and it gives him an alternating view. He [also] has a little set of glasses that he wears — in fact, y ou can actually buy a 3-D viewing sy stem for y our video cam era now that does this sam e thing — so when he looks around, he has a perfect 3-D view of the outside, but no windows. So, why do they have no windows? Well, it’ s probably because the voltages that we’re talking about [ being] used in this sy stem were probably som ething between, say , half a m illion and a m illion volts of electricity . Now, he said there were three vehicles. Th e first one — the sm allest, the one that was partially taken apart, the one that was shown in the video that was running in this hangar Novem ber 12, 1988 at Norton Air Force Base — was about 24 feet in diam eter at its widest part, right at the base. The next biggest one was 60 feet in diam eter at the base. 326"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"Now, I started looking at the design of this thing, and it occurred to me that what I was looking at was a huge Tesla coil, which is kind of like an open-air transform er. What happens is that when y ou pass electricity through this large diam eter coil, it creates a field. That’ s what this sy stem does: it takes electricity , using two large 24-volt marine-sty le batteries. You basically use that to som ehow put an alternating current through these windings. [Then] , you step up that electricity through the secondary coil, which is on the colum n in the middle, and y ou get this extrem ely high voltage. You can selectively put the voltage on any of these 48 capacitor sections. Well, why would you want to do that? If y ou’re using just a norm al Tesla coil, y ou usually have m aybe one or two capacitors in the whole system . But, y ou’re talking about a different ty pe of capacitor here — y ou’re talking about capacitors that are m ade up of plates — plates that are shaped like long, thin triangles, and they are all radially -oriented just like the spokes of a wheel, just like the oxy gen tanks, just like the field lines from that large diam eter coil. As y ou look at this sy stem , if y ou’re an electrician or just som ebody who knows a little bit about Tesla coils and the way they are set up, y ou begin to realize that the orientation of com ponents is really the key to making the sy stem work. Why so many different capacitor sections? If y ou just have one big disc like Mark Stam bough did with his experim ent at the University of [ Arizona] — which, by the way , was confiscated by m en claim ing to be from the governm ent and claim ing privilege under the National Security Act. They took all this st uff, interviewed all the people that saw the experim ents, and told every body to keep their m ouths shut and not talk about it. But, I heard about it from his room mate who knew what had happened. [ Any way ], in that case, y ou have levitation, but y ou don’t get any control. You have this thing floating around, and it’s just sort of floating on whatever this field is that it’s producing, but y ou don’t have any control. So, what happens? You break that disc up into 48 different sections, and then y ou can decide how m uch electricity you want to put on this side or over there on that side, so you can control the am ount of electricity and the am ount of thrust and vectoring that y ou get. You can m ake it go straight up, y ou can m ake it bank and turn and p itch — whatever y ou want to, by virtue of the fact that y ou can control where the electricity go es in those 48 different sections. If you ever take a circle and divide it up into 48 equal sections, you’ ll find that those are really thin little slices. So, y ou have these 48 individual capacitors, and y ou ha ve one big Tesla coil. You’ ve got to have som e kind of a rotating spark gap, just like the distributor in y our car, that sends the electricity out to each of those sections. Then, you have to have som e way of controlling how m uch electricity goes to each one. [A disc-shaped craft like this has omnidirecti onal movement — it isn’t limited to moving in one direction like a jet with a nose and a tail. LW , after talking to M cCandlish.] Now, when Brad described the c ontrol sy stem , he said that on the one side there was this big high-voltage potentiom eter — it’s like a rheostat , a big controller. It allows y ou to put progressively more electricity through the system as y ou push the lever. On the other side of the control sy stem , there was a sort of a metallic bar that cam e up like a stork’s neck, and right at the very tip of it was a sort of m etallic-looking ball. Attached to that ball was a kind of a bowl that seem ed to just hang off the bottom of the ball, al most like it was m agnetically attached to it. He said the whole thing would just sit there, and it would kind of rock and list, alm ost like a large ship at anchor in a harbor on the ocean, floating on the water. It was literally on a sea of energy . 327"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"Dr. John Moray did experim ents with different kinds of energy — som ething that m ay have been scalar energy — back in the early 1920s or the 1930s, I believe it was. He wrote a book called The Sea of Energy , and he describes this ty pe of energy . Brad said that when this thing was m oving around, the sy stem wasn’t energized to its full strength, so com ponents inside the ship were still subject to som e influence by gravity . He [ said] as it would start to list in one direction, the bowl, because of the influence of gr avity , would swing in the sam e direction. As it started to tilt, it would slide over and it would power up the sy stem on that side, and it would bring it back to a righted position all by itself. Com pletely unm anned, it would sit there, and it would correct itself just while it was sitting there. It was all linked fiber-optically . Well, why would that m ake any difference? Why would you want to have a sy stem that’s all linked fiber-op tically ? The reason is that if y ou find a way to control gravity , you reduce the m ass of it. If y ou are able to do that, what are the other side benefits? What if y ou som ehow found a way of tapping into this scalar field, this zero-point energy ? If what the scientists believe is true, th en the zero-point energy is actually what keeps the electrons around the atom ic structure of every thing in our universe. It keeps them energized — it keeps those little electrons spinning in their different clouds around the nucleus of every atom in our world. It keeps them going, keeps them from crashing into the nucleus like a satellite orbiting the Earth gets pulled into the atm osphere by gravitational drag. Well, if y ou have a way of interfering with that interaction, that absorption of zero-point energy by those electrons, they begin to slow down. Every atom in the universe is just like a little gy roscope: it’ s got all these electrons spinning around the nucleus, and they have a gy roscopic eff ect, which is the effect we call inertia and mass. We have one nucleus with a proton and a neutron and one electron — hy drogen — spinning around like that: not very much mass, not too m uch inertia. If y ou take uranium 235, [with] 235 electrons all spinning around in their different clouds, there is a lot of m ass; there is a lot of inertia, because it’ s like a bigger gy roscope, in a way . At least, that’ s the analogy that I’ ve kind of picked up here. But, if y ou have a way of interfering with that absorption of zero-point energy so those electrons becom e de-energized, th ey begin to slow down. The effect of that inertia, that gy roscopic effect, begins to drop off, and the m ass drops off too, even though the atom ic structure is intact; and it’s still there — it’s still uranium , but it’s not as heavy . One of the things Einstein said was that y ou could never accelerate any thing up to and past the speed of light. If y ou did, y ou would have to have all the energy in the universe, because as you accelerate through space, m ass increases. One of the old film s showing this concept shows a train going faster and faster towards the speed of light, but the train keeps getting bigger and bigger until the engine just can’ t pull it, so it can never pass the speed of light. But, what if y ou have a sy stem , a device, that absorbs that zero-point energy and prevents it from interacting with the atom ic structure of the vehicle? And at the sam e tim e, it’ s providing additional power to the capacitor section — this whole electrical sy stem that is going on in the vehicle, that’ s running. In effect, the faster you go, the easier it becom es to go up to and exceed the speed of light. Brad said that in this exhibit at Norton Air Force Base, a three star general said that these vehicles were capable of doing light speed or better. Oh, by the way , the largest of these vehicles was about 120 to 130 feet in diam eter. I m ean, that’ s m assive when y ou think about it — it’ s just huge. 328"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"There is a scientist in Utah by the nam e of Moray B. King — he wrote a book called Tapping the Zero Point Energy . What he m aintains is that this energy is em bedded in space-tim e all around us; it’s in every thing we see. I think it was Jam es Clerk Maxwell who speculated that there’ s enough of this flux, this electrical charge, in the nothingness of space, that if y ou could capture all the energy that was em bedded in just a cubic y ard of space, y ou’ d have enough energy to boil the oceans of the entire world. That’ s how m uch energy is sitting there waiting to be tapped. Now, one of the things that Moray B. Ki ng said was that the best way to tap that energy is by driving it out of equilibrium . It’s just like a bunch of cigarette sm oke in a box, but if y ou som ehow send a shockwave through it, y ou can get force — you can get ripples through it. Then, if y ou have a way of collecting that energy at the other end, y ou have a way of tapping into it and using it. This Alien Reproduction Vehicle, this Flux Liner, has a way of doing that som ehow, electronically . Now, Brad had described the fact that this central colum n has a kind of vacuum cham ber in it. The vacuum cham ber is one of th e things that all of these scientists describe in these over-unity or free energy devices they build. They all have som e kind of vacuum tubes, vacuum technology . Brad m aintained that inside this big vacuum cham ber in the central colum n that’ s inside every thing else — inside the fly wheel, inside the sec ondary coils of the Tesla coil, inside the crew com partm ent — there is m ercury vapor. Merc ury vapor will conduct electricity , but it produces all kinds of ionic effects. These little m olecules of m ercury becom e charged in unusual way s, and if y ou fire a trem endous am ount of electricity through m ercury vapor that’s in a partial vacuum , there is som ething special, som ething unusual that happens in that process. I believe it’s the process that Moray [King] cam e to describe when he [ proposed] driving the energy in the vacuum out of equilibrium , putting som e kind of a shockwave through it. Now, the other thing that I believe happens here, is that as this sy stem begins to tap into this zero-point energy and is drawing it away from the local environm ent, the whole craft becom es lighter in weight — it becom es partially mass-canceled, if y ou will, which is one of the reasons why just a little bit of energy in the capacitors could shoot it all over the place. One of the things that I believe happens, is wh en y ou take a sy stem like this and y ou fire it up, every thing in the sy stem starts to becom e m ass-canceled. The next thing that happens is that the electrons that are flowing through the sy stem also becom e m ass-cancel ed. What does that mean? It m eans as that sy stem and all the elect rons flowing through that big Tesla coil becom e mass-canceled, it also becom es the perfect super-c onductor, which m eans the efficiency of the system s goes right through the ceiling. You get dram atic efficiency , just like the whole thing was dunked into liquid nitrogen or m ade out of pure silv er or pure gold, which at certain tem peratures are perfect conductors — it becom es lighter and can accelerate at incredible speeds. [The faster it goes, the lighter it gets, and the faster it’s able to go. LW , after talking to McCandlish] In 1992, I m et a m an nam ed Kent Sellen and, as it turned out, Kent Sellen and I had a m utual friend: a fellow by the nam e of Bill Scott, or William Scott, who was a local editor for a trade publication called Aviation Week and Space Technology . Bill Scott used to be a test pilot at Edwards Air Force Base back in the early 1970s, and Kent Sellen had been a crew chief working on the plane that Bill Scott flew. So I was talking to Kent Sellen about this and he nodded his head and sm iled a big wide grin, and he winked and he kind 329"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"of said, “Yes, I know what y ou’re talking about.” I [ asked] , how do y ou know what I’m talking about? And he [ said] “Because I’ ve seen one.” At that point, I key ed in on som ething that John Eppolito of IntroVision had told m e about som ething in a hangar — som ething that som eone had seen in a hangar. So, I [ asked] Kent, when I’m m eeting him at th is air show at Edwards in 1992, was it flat on the bottom and had sloping sides and a dom e on th e top and little cam era things? And he said, “Oh, y ou’ ve seen one?” I said, let m e borrow y our pen. I took out a little piece of paper, drew a sketch, and I [asked] does it look like that? He said, “Yes, that’s it — that’s what it looks like.” I [asked] when did you see this? He [ replied] , “I saw it in 1973.” I [ asked] where, when did y ou see it? He [ responded] , “I was a crew chief, [and] I worked on Bill Scott’ s plane when he was a test pilot.” He [told m e] one night [his] shift supervisor [h ad told him ], “Go out to North Base — they ’ve got a ground power unit for an aircraft that’s leaki ng or failed or som ething, so we need y ou to take a tow vehicle out there. Go out, pick it up, bring it back, drop it off at the repair depot; then you can go for the night, because we’ ve finished all our other work.” Well, instead of going around the big perim eter road that goes up to the main entrance of North Base, Kent Sellen drove straight across the dry lake bed at Edwards to the North Base facility . He [cam e] up off the dry lake bed, [rolled] right up on the tarm ac, a nd [was] going down these rows of hangars — they [were] all Quonset-sty le hangars back then. He [stopped] in front of the first one with the doors cracked, expecting to find this defective ground power unit, and what [ did] he see? He [ saw] this fly ing saucer sitting in the hangar, hovering off the ground. This brings m e back to John Eppolito’s st ory about a guy who saw a UFO in a hangar som etim e prior to 1982, when I m et him . I [ asked ], what happened? He [ said] , “This thing was flat on the bottom , [with] sloping sides, little cam eras in these little plastic dom es all over, [and] there was a door on the side. I wasn’ t there for 15 seconds, [ when] I heard footsteps running up to m e, and before I could even turn around and look, there was a machine gun barrel at my throat.” A gruff voice [ said] , “Close y our ey es and get on the ground, or we’re going to blow your head off.” They put a hood over his head, blindfolded him , hauled him off, and they spent 18 hours debriefing him . While they did, they told him things about this vehicle that m y buddy Brad didn’t even know. Brad had said that all of the com ponents in the sy stem were off-the-shelf com ponents — things that y ou could find right in the inventor y. They [had] their own oxy gen supply , and he [said] they [ejected] once they [got] below 15,000 feet. The individual seats [ cam e] down off this central colum n on a set of rails, just like little ra ilroad cars. They [cam e] off one-by -one, and the parachutes [cam e] out, and away they [went] . I looked at all this inform ation that I got from Brad, [ and] I realized there [ was] a m echanical arm that [could] extend out from these little trap doors that [ opened] up on the side of the vehicle. It [was] obvious that these things [ were] capable of space travel. 10 [ or] 15 y ears ago, I was talking to Tom Bearden about scalar effects. One of the things that he said, just off the top of his head, was, “Have y ou ever wondered why the NASA budget has been cut back so severely ? It’s because they ’ve got all this other technology that is so m uch better, so m uch faster. They are so much better than rocket-propelle d spaceships that take m onths, som etim es y ears, to get to the outer reaches of the solar sy stem .

In fact, I am positive that it’s true. I have m et another m an who knows about these thi ngs. He said, “I work at the B-2 bom ber facility out at Plant 42 in Palm dale and Lan caster. Catty -corner across from the big production facility for the B-2 bom ber, down at the southw est corner of the field is the Lockheed Skunkworks — it’s that huge com plex down there.” I said, yes, I know exactly where that is. He [said] “In the sum mer of 1992, I was outside about 10:30 at night, because I work a late shift and was sm oking a cigarette, and I noticed that the sh eriff’s deputies were blocking off all of the streets surrounding Plant 42. They do that any tim e th ere is a classified aircraft that is com ing in to land or is departing from Plant 42.” He [ continued] , “I noticed all the streets being blocked off, and sitting out in front of this hangar [was] this circular form ation of vehicles — but they [were] really weird vehicles. They [were] like a little tractor with a turret on it, a nd the turret [ had] a big m echanical arm with a basket on the end of it. It’s the kind of thing that electrical linem en use to work on high-tension power lines, but the baskets [ were] all up in the air, and strung from each one of the baskets in this big circle is this big black curtain that [ cam e] down, and there [was] a rope that [tied] them all together.” He said, “I looked up above the circular vehicl e, and at about 500 feet was this big, black lens-shaped fly ing saucer, just sitting there above th e vehicles. Out of the m idst of this group of vehicles [ cam e] a m an with a big blue-green handheld flashlight. [ He shined] it up at the vehicle and [flashed] it three tim es. There were three bl ue-green lights underneath the vehicle, and they [flashed back] at him three tim es.” “Then this thing [ lowered] down into [ the] cluste r of vehicles. The arm s all [extended] out over the center and [covered] this craft all up with the curtain — then they all [ trundled] into the hangar. The doors [closed] , lights [cam e] on, [and] the sheriffs [ left] .” He said he sm oked a lot of cigarettes for the next week after that, wa iting to see som ething else, and a week later his patience was rewarded when the whole process rever sed itself. He said that the lights [went] out, the doors [ opened] , [and] this cluster of vehicles [ cam e] out. The arm s all [stood] up, and after a while, this thing silently [rose] up to about 500 feet above the vehicles. The guy [cam e] out with the flashlight, [flashed] three tim es, [and] it [flashed] its lights at him three tim es. Then he said this thing took off, [ covering] the entire length of the runway , which is right next to the B-2 facility . It went past him and disappeared into the dark in under two seconds — and this vehicle did it without any noise, w ithout any supersonic shockwave, no sonic boom , nothing — just like it had been fired from a canon. He said it changed [ his] life. It changed [ his] whole perspective, because then he [ knew they had] anti-gravity — m assless propulsion. He [said they had] technology that they m ight have even recovered from som e kind of a spacecraft that cam e from God-knows-where — som e other star sy stem — but, he [ said] the fact [ was they had] it. 331"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"We have found a patent filed by a Jam es King Jr., and this patent looks just like this sy stem except that instead of having a dom e for a crew co mpartm ent, it has a cy linder in the center. [ It has] the sam e shape, the flat bottom , [and] the sloping sides. It has the coils around the circum ference, [and] it has the capacitor plates that ar e all radially -oriented. This patent was filed initially in 1960 [ and] was secured in 1967 — the sam e y ear that a photo was taken near Provo, Utah that looks just like [ this craft] . The clincher is the guy who filed the pate nt worked with Townsend Brown. Townsend Brown had worked at a laboratory near Princeton, New Jersey with a scientist by the nam e of Agnew Bahnson in the Bahnson Laboratories. They did all these experim ents that they were calling electrogravitic propulsion. There is [ a] video that was converted from the 16-m illim eter film that was shot by Agnew Bahnson’s da ughter. Originally it was called “Daddy ’s Laboratory ”, and it shows all these experim ents that Bahnson and Thom as Townsend Brown did, along with their assistant Jam es King [ J. Frank King] , who filed the patent. That film shows little discs levitating and shooting off sparks and st uff. So, it all kind of com es full circle. You see that now, they not only have the technology , they ’ve got the technology in deploy ment. Not only does it fly but it looks just like the patents that were filed back in the 1960s — the sam e y ear the photos were taken near Area 51 — between Area 51 and Provo, Utah, by a m ilitary pilot. It shows all the sam e feat ures; it shows all the sam e shapes. So, the bottom line for me is that regardless of whether y ou unde rstand all the fine points of the technology , the technology exists and there are people that have seen it. I have seen these things m yself, so to m e it’s just really a m atter of tim e before they bring this technology out of the black and begin to let us use it for other things like pollution-free production of energy . You could probably take a couple of little things that look like those fly ing saucers and put them around a crank shaft and use them to drive an engine, pollution-free — no use of fuel. Any way, the only other thing that I could say , is that when I was talking about the fiber optic control sy stem , that’s also one of the things th at goes back to the original Roswell account that there were all these little fibers with light going th rough them , and they couldn’ t explain what this stuff was. Well, why would you need a fibe r optic sy stem in a spaceship? If, suddenly , every thing in the vehicle becom es m ass-canceled, and even the electrons becom e mass-canceled, it m eans that all of the telem etry that’s going th rough your system is going to go hay wire. It’s going to be like, suddenly , the system goes through a phase change, and every thing is super- conducting. So, y ou have to have som e way of maintaining the sam e level of control for y our spark gaps — the control of the am ount of electri city that goes out of the capacitors — so that when you change the control stick, y ou still ge t the sam e am ount of m ovem ent and deflection in the sy stem , even when y ou go into a state of mass-cancellation or partial m ass-cancellation, because the electrons are also mass-canceled, so they becom e super-conducting circuits. Why use fiber optics? Because photons have no mass, so they are unaffected. That m eans any inform ation, any telem etry that y ou send back and forth to y our com puter gets there. It doesn’ t m atter if the com puter functions at the super-conducting level, because it just m akes it faster, m ore efficient, sm arter. You want to be able to control the aircraft so it doesn’ t crash, and what’s the best way to do it? With fiber optics. 332"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"333"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":" Testimony of Professor Paul Cz ysz Novem ber 2000 Dr. Paul Czy sz is a Professor of Aeronautical Engineering at Parks College in St. Louis. He spent 8 y ears in the Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, and another 30 years working for McDonnell-Douglas in the field of exotic technologies. While at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, he was involved in tracking UFOs over Missouri, Ohio, and Michigan. These UFOs were seen my many people: m ilitary , local police, and civilians, and were clocked at speeds around 20,000 MPH as they perform ed unusual, silent m aneuvers. Dr. Czy sz spen t m ore than half his career at McDonnell- Douglas working on classified and com partm entalized projects, and testifies to the processes involved in m aintaining secrecy on these projects. He warns against the hum an tendency to m ake every new technology into a weapon, pointing out that our weaponization of space does not address the threat of Earth terrorists, and the idea of using these weapons against extraterrestrial targets would be suicidal. PC: Prof. Paul Czy sz  I: Interviewer PC: I’m a graduate of Parks College. I started in the Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and was in the Air Force for two y ears, [plus] stay ed an additional six years working in research. Then I returned to McDonnell-Douglas and stay ed there for thirty years. I finally ended up at Parks College again as an endowed Chair. At McDonnell-Douglas, we did lot of high-speed work — hy personics. We worked on things that flew from Mach 4 to Mach 12, and had som e airplanes that flew Mach 12 all the way around the world. We alm ost built it. One of the m ore interesting nights I had at Wr ight-Patterson was when I was the assistant to the head officer-of-the-day over at Patterson Fiel d. We had 151 phone calls com e in regarding unidentified objects fly ing down U.S. 40 — then tu rning at Colum bus and going up to Detroit. These [calls] were [from ] state policem en, som e doc tors that worked late at night, all kinds of people that reported seeing this. We had radar track s on them and had airliners call in that they had seen them . It was very , very interesting. These guy s gave very clear descriptions of what they saw. You know, probably m ore than half of m y career was in projects that were classified or com partm entalized. I: Can y ou describe how that process works? PC: Generally , depending on the level of the com partm entalization and the secrecy level, you have to go through a fairly significant background check. It takes between six m onths to a year to get the background checks. Then, when y ou do that, if y ou’re in a very tight com partm ent, you sign a statem ent that y ou will not divulge the existence of the project or even answer a question that could acknowledge the existe nce of the project. It’s not even on a need-to- know basis; it’s on the basis of people being iden tified specifically to know what y ou’re working on and [who are] directly associated with the project, so it’ s very closely -contained m aterial. 334"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"If y ou have a covert project, the funding would com e through a num ber of governm ent sources, none of which would be identified to th e workers. Whatever high-level people were involved in it — even they m ight not know where the funding cam e from . It’s just that y ou sign a contract with the U.S. governm ent, and the funding would show up at the right place at the right tim e. If there were non-Earthbound sources of the info rm ation, the people who were doing the design work or doing the analy sis work would never have any idea of where it [ the m ateriel] cam e from . All y ou would have to do is visit Russia to see how they did it. They would com partm entalize every project into what I used to call silos, and they would have a colonel or a general sitting on top of that, and literally , they coul d not talk to any one outside of that silo. If som eone else needed help, one person would be sent over to another place, sit down at a desk, look at a piece of paper, say , “Yes, I know what that problem is; here’ s the answer to it,” and walk away . He would not even know what it was that he was working on. The giant triangles that appear over Palm dale move very slowly — they ’re very large and very slow-m oving. That’s different, I think, [ fro m] the ones that appear all over Belgium and that are very fast-m oving. You can’t explain that in conventional phy sics. By conventional phy sics, I m ean engines and jet engines and rocket m otors and propulsion sy stem s as we know them today . You put fuel in, you burn som ething, and it produces thrust and accelerates an object. In conventional phy sics, you cannot explain how hum an beings could live long enough to go m uch bey ond the edge of our little solar sy stem . So, in conventional term s, no, y ou can’t explain it. It has to be related to quantum phy sics, in which things can appear to be alm ost two places at the sam e tim e, and appear and reappear just like positrons and electrons do in som e of the high-en ergy particle colliders. It’s a coupling of the device with the energy that perm eates space. Proba bly Tesla was close to it when he said that if given the right energy sy stem , the right electrom agnetic spectrum , he could power a hum an base on Mars from Earth, without any loss of energy . In quantum phy sics and zero-point energy , that’s a possibility . Sakharov and others were working on this a nd m ade very convincing argum ents that the fabric of space is like an ocean, an energy ocean , in which solid energy is floating, and solid energy is the m ass. If that’ s true, then gravity waves exist, and in fact, every thing goes back to Heavy side’ s [ phonetic spelling] equations. Here , the quantum is now not m ass, but tim e. If that’s true, then y ou look at the whole universe in a different light. A lot of things becom e possible, that we think im possible within our current understanding of what tim e and space and thrust and force are. If these UFOs com e from another part of the universe, it m ust involve som ething like this. Even our galaxy is about 100,000 light y ears acro ss. All of the conventional thrust and force mechanism s that we conceive of just won’ t wo rk in term s of hum an tim efram es. If people are here from another civilization, then they ’ve unde rstood the finer points of quantum phy sics. When I was at Wright-Patterson, we had th e fly ing saucers that covered the distance from Colum bus to Detroit in som ething like the equiva lent of about 20,000 m iles an hour. Back then, I don’ t think any one in the ordinary aerospace bus iness would have had any knowledge of quantum phy sics or worm holes or the ty pes of things we know now. But, if y ou went to CERN now and talked to the particle phy sicists, they would te ll y ou certainly , som e of this was possible, because they see it all the tim e. Where they think they see m ass, they really see energy frozen in a tim e 335"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"quantum . What they ’re seeing is really a frozen bundle of energy . It m oves back and forth alm ost without any restrictions. The UFOs weren’t phenom ena that were [ just] pe ople’ s im agination. Whatever they saw was real; I couldn’ t explain how it was real, what m ade it real, but I think they saw what they saw. Near St. Louis, there was a fairly large tr iangular object seen, and it traveled the distance down to south St. Louis. In som e of its sigh tings, it was m oving relatively benignly , but then it literally jum ped about 20 m iles in a couple of seconds. I received a lot of phone calls from the local newspapers and TV stations, asking how that could be done. I said, I don’t know how it can, unless you explain it through som ething like a quantum phy sics explanation of tim e and space and relationships that gave you tim e and space travel. Other than that, there’ s no way to do that. And, this object m ade no sound at all. It starts out at hover, and it literally alm ost disappears and pops over here — so it’s not like a cartoon where it goes “whoosh.” It’s alm ost like it disappears and com es up over here, according to the descriptions that som e of the police officers gave. The hard part is to find a way to phy sically do that. There are people who have been experim enting with zero-point energy , or who trie d to tap zero-point energy for years. Every once-in-a-while, som eone will do it accidentally . They ’ll call it cold fusion, but I don’ t think it’s cold fusion; I just think it’s a zero-point energy tap. Except for three people that I know, no one has been able to control it. When it happens, it happens for a short period of tim e and it’s alm ost alway s destructive. It’s like drilling a hole into the base of Grand Coulee Dam , and all of a sudden a jet of water com es out that literally has enough pressure to cut y ou in half. Without a valve on it, y ou can’t shut it off. There’s one guy that a friend of m ine actua lly visited in Ann Arbor, Michigan, who I consider a m athem atical genius, and who actually figured out a way to control it. He was terrified that som eone would kill him for the know ledge that he had and the ability to tap this whenever he chose to, and control it. We have n’t seen him in five y ears; we don’ t know where he is. Today you’ve got an energy problem with the price of oil. What do y ou think would happen if y ou introduced the ability to tap this zero-point energy ? Zero-point energy represents about 40- 50 m egawatts of power per cubic inch of space. Th at’ s a lot of power. If y ou could tap it at will, then no one would have to sell gasoline or oil any more. You would just tap into it. It would be like going out to the Great Lakes and taking out one drop and using it — y ou’d hardly m iss it. And, since it perm eates the whole universe and it continually fluctuates as m atter-antim atter interaction, it’s not like it’s a steady lake. It’s a pool the size of the universe. So, for what we would use it for, y ou’d never even m iss it. This one researcher claim ed if y ou bottle it and m ove it to another location and release it, you’ d create a tear in the tim e dom ain of local space and actually cause a problem , which he claim s he did, and he will never do it again. Also, it doesn’t work in conventional jet engi nes. One has to create an actual zero-point energy engine to do that. This researcher in Ann Arbor, Michigan had one running in his basem ent. It was not connected to any power s ource whatsoever, sitting in the m iddle of a table, and it had been running for a y ear. 336"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"But, none of these researchers would have an inkling of how y ou would build a ship the size of a football field and make it m ove at the speeds that apparently it [ the one near St. Louis] moved. Speed’ s actually the wrong word, because conventionally , we think of this as speeding through space, but what if it really acts like som e of the high-energy particles at CERN? They really transfer into energy and reappear over here, and there was no m ass that went any where — because all m ass is solid energy . The conventiona l wisdom is that a com plex organic structure like [ a hum an] cannot transfer back and forth from energy to solid, but that’ s just because we’ ve never seen it done. What y ou represent is solid energy . You think y ou’ re solid, right? In fact, the distance between the atom s in y our body [is] alm ost ex actly relatively proportional to the sam e distance as the planets around the sun. So, if y ou could look at y our individual atom s, y ou would be 98 percent space. If y ou were the equivalent of a neutron star, which is only the nucleus and the electrons com pressed, y ou would fit on the point of a pin. When y ou really get down to what you’re m ade out of, the total state of y ou is on the point of a pin. Jam es S. McDonnell [ who founded McDonnell-Douglas Aircraft] actually had an institute to study paranorm al psy chology . That’s why his airp lanes were nam ed Banshee and Phantom . He was an Irishm an who was very m uch interested in the spiritual world and the paranorm al, and he had part of his research departm ent working with [ his] foundation to study the paranorm al. [See the testimony of Dr. Robert W ood confirming this. SG] The “Great Randi”, the m agician, infiltrated his organization and actually , for about six months, did sleight-of-hand experim ents to [deceive] him . There would be som ething really there, and then he’ d discredit it — the head of th e research departm ent eventually would not even talk about any thing related to this. The guy in Ann Arbor that had the zero-point energy m achine actually cam e to McDonnell- Douglas. He and his partners cam e in, and they we re going to talk about this hy drogen m otor that they had. I got invited to the m eeting, and about halfway through it, I just said, guy s, you have a zero-point energy m achine — why don’ t you adm it it? The head of the research departm ent who was discredited [by Randi] was put off when the inventors discussed this. [He] had the guards com e in and escort them off the pl ant, because the head of research was just so terrified of this happening again — he thought it was pseudoscience. I said, it’s not pseudoscience; it’s just bey ond what we know right now. [There are many accounts of people infiltrating operations to discredit or spin an area of research so it is ridiculed, thus keeping it out of mainstream development and acceptance. SG] Parapsy chology — how do you measure it? The only people I know that have com e close are the Russians in their parapsy chology institutes, m ost of which are all now defunct. They had som e very interesting twins that they were doing experim ents with: they were measuring som ething that was occurring between the two of them , in their brains, so they could actually know what the other one was thinking. It’s utterly am azing — the spectrum of electrom agnetics that are going on inside the brain. The Russians have done a lot with what’ s called scalar waves and different spectrum electrom agnetics within the brain. They ’re convinced that y ou can explain parapsy chology , if you could ever find out what it is that y ou’ d have to m easure to prove that it’s occurring. But, they just got to the edge of perhaps m easuring som ething. 337"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"It’s all based on phy sics. If it’ s scalar waves, then y ou’ re in a whole other avenue of phy sics that [is] very controversial. Tesla was very , very m uch into those. The difficulty with Tesla, is that when he passed away , J. Edgar Hoover cam e in and confiscated alm ost every thing. When his m aid discovered him dead, she didn’t discove r him dead alone — she discovered five FBI agents in his room pilfering every thing, and he was [ lying] on the bed dead. His nephew sued the U.S. governm ent and won back, theoretically , all of his equipm ent, experim ents, and records. [See government documents at the end of this interview! SG] There were, theoretically , fifty boxes [of records, et c.] , but they only got forty -five of those in Belgrade. The other five are m issing, and a whole bunch of stuff is m issing. We also found a record of a subm arine that was in the Mediterranean in 1917 [ or] 1918. Tesla, in New Jersey , put one of these antennas in the ocean, right off the coast, and [one] on the shore. He’s holding a conversation with the capta in of the subm arine — one of the guy s actually dug out of the Navy records the log of the subm arine, and it essentially say s: som e idiot who’ s claim ing he is in New Jersey is talking to m e; he m ust be absolutely crazy because I know I am 100 feet underwater, and no one can be talki ng to m e from New Jersey — and he had the matching language in Tesla’ s logbook. So, what was that? People say no — it was an accident, it was a coincidence, etc., but there are a lot of things we can’t explain that people have actually done. Back when I was a y oung engineer at McDonne ll in the 1960s, we routinely designed for the Air Force and the Navy airplanes that flew at Mach 4 and 6. The Vietnam War interfered with most of that, but we had running engines that would fly Mach 6, easily . We actually had tested engines that would fly the Mach 12 airplanes. In fact, in 1966 a fellow by the nam e of Bill Esher — he’s still alive, working for SAIC in Huntsville — had on the test stand an engine that was within 5 percent of predicted perform ance of M ach 8 conditions at about 120,000 feet, and it ran for about 20 m inutes. We were convinced we could build them then. What’ s fascinating is I got to see the X-33 a couple weeks ago. They had this new breakthrough — a new shingle technology that allowed the inside of the airpla ne to be room tem perature, while the shingles reflect the heat. We built alm ost exactly the sam e structure in 1965 and tested it to Mach 12 conditions. It is a little bit more elegant than what we had, because they have m ore elegant materials these day s, but we were convinced we could do it then. People laugh at y ou and say , no you couldn’ t, or no, it’ s im possible, we’ re not going to do that because it’ s risky . But no, it wasn’t risky , and y es, it could be done. All it takes is a dream er. Can y ou im agine the Wright brothers if one was a lawy er, and one was an accountant? They would say : “Why do y ou have to build a stupi d airplane? It only carries one person. Who’s going to buy it; what kind of profit m argin are we going to get? We’ve got 40 percent on bicy cles; what are we doing this for? Think of the liability — every body can sue us. It’s a bad idea; let’s not do it.” As long as we have that mind-set, we’re stuck. What y ou have to say is: “By gosh, it’s som ething that no one’s ever done before; let’s try it.” If I were to look at [the period of tim e] since m y first introduction to UFOs as a y oung lieutenant, to today , I would say there’ s a large num ber of covert projects that go on in the United States that none of us are ever aware of. If y ou saw som e of those things, they would probably bend your mind, and they would not fit y our conception of what an airplane is — so it seem s to you to be a UFO. So, m aybe a large fraction of those [suspected UFOs] are covert projects that we’re doing, or som eone’s doing, that are Ea rthbound [ technologies] . If y ou really knew what was behind them , y ou would say , y es, I can see how that works. 338"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"[See the testimony of M ark M cCandlish regardi ng functioning antigravity vehicles made by humans, and which could easily be misidentified as extraterrestrial vehicles. It is clear from many insiders with whom I have spoken that we have both man-made exotic craft as well as ET craft — and they are all called UFOs. SG] I think it’s like Project Bluebook: there’s this hardcore 10-15 percent, or 20 percent, that don’t fit any explanation other than the fact that the beings that are in the UFOs cam e here by way of a process that we’ re not fam iliar with — and that is tim e-space travel. I firm ly believe that som e of those are like that. Alm ost any thing y ou can think of can be turned around and used as a weapon. When you get into this kind of energy , and energy -tim e transiti ons, they can be used to just wipe out whole segm ents of the population on the Earth — and they can be m ade to liberate us from all dependence on fossil fuels. [It is obvious that in order for hum anity to c ontinue with adequate technologies for long-term sustainability , peace is the first requirem ent. We are clearly at the point in our evolution where the option to use such technologies for war m eans the end of our civilization. SG] First of all, the ballistic m issile defense sy stem is probably a pipe dream , in the sense that what it’s designed for is assum ing that y ou know wh ere [ the threat] is com ing from . When we had Russia, there was a 50-50 chance that y ou knew about where it would be com ing from . With the rogue nations that we have today , it’s absolu tely ludicrous. The threat is the guy who walks in with the briefcase — rem ember that in the 1950s, they built a nuclear warhead that has an eight-inch-diam eter body . That was a quarter kiloton weapon. That will fit inside any briefcase you can think of. The guy m ay die carry ing it, but he’s going to die any way, so what difference does it m ake? I’ m far m ore afraid of that. If be ings can travel in tim e-space, then any thing we would put in orbit as a weapon would be like going against Genghis Khan with a firecracker. It doesn’ t m ake sense. [Here he makes a very salient point regarding the weaponization of space: the real threats from Earth terrorists would not be addressed by such weapon systems, and the notion of using them against any extraterrestrial target borders on the suicidal, if not insane. These comments also support the idea that IF the extraterrestrials were hostile (thus requiring space weapons), Earth civilization could have easily been term inated around the time we detonated the first nuclear weapon. That we are still here is st rong support for the assessment that the ET presence is not a threat and cannot be used as an excuse for space-based weapons. SG] When we talk about zero-point energy , what that m eans is when every thing com es down to rest, there’ s still energy left. It’ s like sea level in the ocean. There is a constant flow of energy between m atter and antim atter, as it annihilates itself and recreates itself. It occurs in stars — it’s a continual exchange of energy . Although the average is zero, that zero m ay be a pretty high level above nothing at all. What Sakharov and som e of the phy sicists said, is that it’s this level that creates the background energy for the universe to exist. When I got involved in space again with Sandy McDonald, and we started what eventually becam e the National Aerospace Plane, I m et a group of Russians over in England at a conference. One of them had been involved in transm itting energy from an antenna on the ground to a satellite in orbit, and back down to Moscow, with only about 10-15 percent losses. He said the reason we can do this, is this is a scalar wave pr ojector, and here’ s what it uses — he opens up his 339"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"loose-leaf binder and say s, “You can’t take any pictures of this or m ake any sketches; just look at it.” And, lo and behold, there’s the tube I saw in Yugoslavia, which Tesla had built! This was the antenna that Caspar Weinberger was say ing was the antiballistic m issile weapon [ the Russians allegedly had] . He say s if y ou ever go in the bu ilding [where this scalar device is located] , all you’ re going to see is an em pty concrete building with a couple of cables — because it’ s not an anti-ballistic missile radar — it’ s a scalar wave tr ansm itter. Finally , when the U.S. DoD got in there, they found an em pty concrete building with a couple of wires in it, and they said, “Ah, they pulled every thing out.” But, he say s it never was in there. He claim s he transm itted up to 10 megawatts of power from this station, to a sate llite, to Moscow, and got about 8.5 to 9 m egawatts of power back in Moscow. [Note that Dr. Carol Rosin also confirms that the U.S. exaggerated the anti-missile threat of the Soviets — we were claiming that they had ‘killer satellites’ when they did not. SG] They were on the verge of understanding how you do som e of these unconventional things, but all of that is now gone. I don’t know where he is. He lost his job, [ and] his institute disappeared, so a lot of that work just collapsed in the Soviet Union. [See also the testimony of Lt. Col. Bearden and David Hamilton.] That’ s the sam e tube that Tesla said he could [use to] transm it energy to Mars — the surface of Mars — and support a hum an colony , or [ the sam e] to the surface of the Moon. Once y ou actually do that, fuel doesn’ t becom e a problem an ymore in orbit: y ou just use one of these tubes to generate the power directly to the right ante nna, and y ou can fly to the m oon, y ou can fly into orbit, y ou can do any thing y ou want. The people that have access to [ these advanced energy technologies] don’ t know how to let go of it, because they ’re afraid of who’ s going to get their hands on it. Even though there would be a trem endous benefit to m ankind, they ’re also worried that som ebody could take that sam e energy source and do the equivalent of what they did with the USS Cole — instead of blowing a hole in the side, they could just obliterate the whole ship. The black budget world is like try ing to describe Casper, the friendly ghost. You m ight see a cartoon of him , but y ou don’t know how big he is, y ou don’t know where his funding com es from , you don’ t know how m any there are, because of the com partm entalization and the oath that people have to take.

You have no idea, but it’s probably larger than y ou think. And again — there’s a reason for it: y ou don’t want people who would be hostile to y ou to know what y ou could do to them if they really caused a major catastrophe.

And m y Russian friends say that part of the governm ent that does that sort of thing is no different from th e Mafia. So that com plicates the problem .... I am concerned that if we don’t do som ething very soon, any society that begins to be resource lim ited begins to elim inate the problem causing that resource lim itation.

And it is not one cartel. It is many , many groups in energy . And each of those has becom e very powerful in its own area. And each one does not wish to see sim ple little electrical taps pulling out enorm ous energy from the vacuum . They would m uch rather see y ou burning a lot m ore oil and so forth...

The marginalization by the scientific establishm ent of the cold fusion topic bears strong resem blance to the sim ilar m arginalization of the ET/UFO topic: both have been ridiculed and defam ed because they break established paradigm s. As Dr. Mallove states in this interview, “There is nothing worse...than suggesting to academ ic phy sicists in particular, and academ ics in general, that they are not only wrong; they are disastrously wrong, catastrophically wrong.” In his m agazine, Dr. Mallove has advised us to rem ember the sentim ents of Michael Faraday : “Nothing is too wonderful to be true.” ... We know for a fact, today , that the cold fusion low energy nuclear reactions are real.

There has been an extraordinary abrogation of basic legal responsibility at the Patent Office and at the Departm ent of Energy on the m atter of cold fusion. Cold fusion patents have not been approved. The only way of approving any patent that resem bles cold fusion is to elim inate the words cold fusion or any thing like it. Cert ain people have done that and succeeded. The Patterson power cell is one such exam ple. It was an age acceleration cl ause (because of the age of Dr. Patterson) that helped him , and he went th rough a different art group at the Patent Office. But predom inantly , if the patent goes through a certain gentlem an at the Patent Office today whose nam e is Harvey , he will reject all such patents. They will not get through. Am erican citizens are being denied their constitutional rights in this particular case. There is no question about it. We have a com plete audit trail on that .

In effect, new energy technologies are the underdog: They don’t fit the paradigm so they are left out of the needed funding, or their patents are denied — even to the point that the Patent Office is breaking the law.

It usually becom es obvious to any one study ing this field that the Am erican press has play ed an im portant role over the last ha lf century in helping spread disinform ation and shaping the public’ s views on UFO/ET issues 30 . The press has often been an unknowing partner in the distribution of misinform ation/disinform ation or a knowing partner in the refusal to report real events. It is exceedingly rare that m ajor si ghtings are reported at the national level. When reports are m ade, they often done in a condescendi ng, slanted, “add the giggle factor” m anner that leaves the audience confused and turned off. Two recent exceptions were the report of the Phoenix Lights story in USA Today 31 by Richard Price and the Boston Globe report on the French COMETA report 32 by Leslie Kean. Both articles were well researched and presented in a balanced, non-judgm ental m anner. We recommend the press take the following actions: 1. We recom mend that reporters writing on this topic fam iliarize them selves with the evidence and the im plications of this topic. It is felt by m any who have studied the UFO/ET issue that it is the m ost im portant i ssue facing the world today . This im portance should be convey ed to the readers in a responsible serious m anner; 2. We recom mend that m edia organizations assign these issues to sen ior, well-respected, nationally -recognized journalists and repor ters. These issues should no longer be confined to filler articles assigned to juni or staff or relegated to entertainm ent program ming; 3. We recom mend that the present clichés of reporting on these issues, which m aybe intended to “dum b down” the topic by conve ying a non-serious and silly tone to the reporting, be elim inated. These include th e use of opening statem ents such as “little green m en” and the film ing of interviewees with weird cam era angles, colored lights, fog generators and the like. All of these techni ques, which have been successfully used for decades to “spin” the topic, m ust be elim inated if the public is to believe the seriousness of y our reporting. 4.2 Recommended Public Actions We recommend the public take the following actions: 1. We recom mend that the public open their m inds to UFO/ET issues by thoughtfully investigating the issues them selves; 2. We recom mend that the public, once recognizing the im plications of a disclosure, encourage the press and public officials to research and report responsibly on them and   30 See Hanson, T., The M issi ng Ti mes: News M edia C omplicity in the UFO C over-up. 2001 31 See copy in Appendi x I (Docum ent A1.18). 32 See copy in Appendi x I (Docum ent A1.19). 350"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"further to take part in a dialogue addressing a dram atically transform ed view of hum ans on this planet and their future place as part of a larger group of intelligent beings; 3.

We recom mend that form er governm ent, m ilitary or corporate persons with knowledge about this subject and willingness to be witnesses, contact the Disclosure Project to help make their knowledge public in an honorable a nd patriotic m anner. We have protective measures in place, and the m ore witnesses we have, the stronger the case – and the greater the m argin of safety for all concerned; 5.

If our leaders currently lack this cour age and vision, then we m ust manifest it for them since ultim ately the public will help drive the disclosure effort. 4.3 Recommended Congressional Actions Considering the incredible im portance and im plications of this subject, Congress has play ed an alm ost negligible role over the past four to five decades. In fact only two form al hearings have been held during that tim e period. The first was held by the House Arm ed Services Com mittee on April 5, 1966 because of strong editorial and public criticism of the Air Force Project Blue Book UFO program . Then Representative Gerald Fo rd of Michigan was a strong supporter of the hearings, in part as a result of m ajor sightings that had occurred during March of that year in his state and seen by hundreds of people and reported widely in the press. The result of the hearings was the recom mendation for an independent scientif ic investigation of UFOs, which becam e the University of Colorado “Scientific Study of UFOs” directed by Dr. Edward Condon. Then in 1968, the House Science and As tronautics Com mittee held a “Sy mposium on Unidentified Fly ing Objects” to review the scientif ic evidence for UFOs. Of the six scientists who testified, five opinioned that there was a valid scientific anom aly that should be studied further. In fact, one of the scientists 33 , Dr. Jam es McDonald, a senior phy sicist and professor at the University of Arizona, concluded that, ”My own study of the UFO problem has convinced m e that we m ust rapidly escalate serious scientific attention to this extra-ordinarily intriguing puzzle.” A y ear later the Condon Com mittee concluded that there was no convincing scientific evidence for UFOs and recom mended that Project Blue Book be term inated, which happened later that y ear on Decem ber 17. This surprising c onclusion was reached in spite of the fact that about 30% of the cases investigated by the com mittee had rem ained unexplained. In the 1990s, the refusal of the Air Force to even com ment on the growing evidence of a crash near Roswell, NM lead then Representative Steven Schiff (R-N M) to request that the General Accounting Office conduct a search for related docum ents. In 1995 the GAO released a report stating that they could not find docum ents related to the crash as docum ents from Roswell Arm y Base from that tim e period had been im properly destroy ed. Then in early April, 1997 the CSETI organization held a closed briefing for m embers of congress and civilian witnesses in the hopes that so meone in Congress would have the courage to   33 See sect ions 32.1 and 6.3 (under Dr. R obert W ood for ot her com ments by and about Dr. M cDonal d. 351"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"hold hearings on this topic. No one then nor un til today has had the courage to call for hearings on this topic, even though the statem ent m ade by Rep Gerald Ford in 1966 that “We owe it to the people to establish credibility regarding UFOs,” is as true today as it was then. It is interesting to note that the m embers of the Senate have ne ver held any hearings on this subject although privately individuals have expressed significant interest in the subject. We recommend that Congress take the followi ng actions to pursue this matter: 1. Make directed inquiries to contacts and chairm en of the House and Senate Intelligence Com mittees; 2. Inquire directly to the various faciliti es, agencies and entities listed (section 5.1.3); 3. Pursue other contacts known to the Congress, which may be able to assist in identify ing points of control for these operations. 4. Purse this m atter further by convening Congressional Hearings whereby direct witnesses to these projects m ay testify . We believe more than one member of Congress should be located to co-sponsor such an inquiry . 5. Pass a Congressional ban on weapons in space and encourage our allies and the UN to do the sam e. Note that once issues concerning the validity of National Security oaths (Section 4.7.2) and am nesty (Section 4.7) are resolved by congress and/or presidential order, there are hundreds of potential witnesses who are willing to testify on the reality of the UFO/ET issues and their im plications for our country ’s future. It is only through the m edium of open a nd public congressional hearings that an understanding of the com plexity of these issues may be achieved and our country can m ove forward. Because of the interconnections between the UF O issue and the world’ s energy status and technology , it will also be necessary to also hold Congressional Hearings on these energy issues as well, as a pursuant, but som ewhat parallel process. Once the reality of the UFO issues are accep ted by Congress, then we recom mend that Congress: 1. Thoroughly investigate these new technologies both from current civilian sources as well as com partm ented projects within m ilitary , intelligence and corporate contracting areas. 2. Authorize the declassification and release of inform ation held within com partm ented projects related to this subject. 3. Specifically prohibit the seizing or suppression of such technologies. 4. Authorize substantial funding for basic research and developm ent by civilian scientists and technologists m aking this research available to the public and mainstream scientists. 5. Develop plans for dealing with disclosing such technologies and for the transition to a non-fossil fuel econom y . These plans should include am ong others: m ilitary and national security planning; strategic econom ic planning and preparation; private 352"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"sector support and cooperation; geopolitical planning, especially as it pertains to OPEC countries and regions whose econom ies are very dependent on oil exports and the price of oil; international cooperation and security . The Disclosure Project stands ready to assist the Congress in any way possible to facilitate use of these new energy sources. We can recom mend a num ber of individuals who can be subpoenaed to provide testim ony on such tec hnologies, as well as people who have inform ation on unacknowledged special access projects within cove rt governm ent operations that are already working with these issues. 4.4 Recommended Military Actions Since the early 1990s, the Director and m embers of the Disclosure Project have briefed various high level m ilitary officials including th e Head of Intelligence Joint Staff (J-2), the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA ), Director of Central Intelligence, Wright Patterson Director of National Air Intelligence Cent er and others. It has becom e obvious to us during these briefings that senior officers have not been inform ed on this subject. This constitutes a serious threat to the national security and to m ilitary readiness. To quote Adm iral Roscoe Hillenkoetter, “I urge im mediate congressional action to reduce the dangers from secrecy about Unidentified Fly ing Objects.” Note that here he is em phasizing the dangers from secrecy , not danger arising from UFOs. 34 We recommend senior military and national securi ty leaders take the following actions: 1. Receive a thorough briefing on the subject by the Disclosure Project leadership and military /civilian witnesses; 2. Fully brief CINCS (Com mander in Chiefs ), and develop special ROEs (Rules of Engagem ent) for ETI/UFO encounters; 3. Independently investigate the subject and penetrate USAP (Unacknowledged Special Access Projects, see section 3.4) operations related to the subject; 4. Becom e fully involved in covert projects related to the subject to ensure that such projects are adequately supervised and are under the direct and continuous control of the constitutional chain of com mand; 5. Correct and/or restrain any USAP’s covert m isuse of advanced technologies or weapon sy stem s related to UFOs; 6. Attem pt peaceful, cooperative engagem ent of these life form s and assiduously avoid violent m ilitary engagem ent; 7. Carefully reconsider the deploy ment of space-based m ilitary assets in light of the above inform ation and avoid actions that might be viewed as bellicose or hostile by extraterrestrial life form s.

Twentieth century scientific theories have barely touched the surface in explaining what num erous scientific, military and civilian witnesses have observed and reported. However, in som e cases, covert military research program s appear to have adva nced m uch further in understanding the observed phenom ena and technologies (based on witness testim onies, section 3.8) than have our academ ic and public scientists. Recent findings, such as the de monstration of possible faster than speed of light phenom enon 35 , suggest that indeed there will be a whole new class of scientific phenom ena that 21 st century scientists will investigate to explai n what has been declared as “im possible” by scientists of the last century . There is still a m ajor acceptance problem about UFO/ET issues with m ost scientists. Dr. Peter Sturrock, a highly respected solar phy sici st and now an em eritus professor at Stanford University , sum marized the problem as follows: “The definite resolution of the UFO enigm a will not com e about unless and until the problem is subjected to open and extensive scientific study by the norm al procedures of established science. This requires a change in attitude prim arily on the part of scientists and adm inistrators in universities.” 36 A further view by Dr. Sturrock on the role of scientists and scientific journals is quoted in section 3.2.1. Surprising though it m ay seem to the lay person, scientists often have trouble changing their understanding of processes and natura l phenom ena when faced with evidence that their theories may not be correct. The history of science is replete with exam ples of scientists proclaim ing such and such is im possible, only to be shown later that their assum ptions were incorrect. This norm al hum an tendency is certainly not lim ited to scientists. (For exam ple, for a num ber of y ears after the Wright brother’s pl anes had been observed fly ing by thousands of people, there were still popular articles proclaim ing that fly ing is im possible.) Furtherm ore, m ost scientific research in the United States, especially in colleges and universities, is colleague-driven through the peer review process for prom otion and tenure as well as for grants and journal publications. Stepping outside the bounds of peer accepted research often spells difficulty for the scientist, even if they are well established in m ore conventionally accepted scientific areas. Consequently , the vast m ajority of academ ics are not willing to take such a risk, since it is safer to rem ain with the accepted views of the day .   35 W ang, L. J., A. Kuzm ich, and A.

Since the 1950s, scientists have been used to persuade the public that there is “no scien tific evidence” of UFO phenom ena. High profile scientists are still play ing that role today , as did one of the leaders in the SETI program who stated in a recent public guest lecture at Harvard Un iversity that “there is no scientific evidence of the existence of UFOs.” There are several possibl e explanations for this statem ent. Either she was unaware of the depth of evidence on the s ubject, in which case she could have qualified her authoritative pronouncem ent, or she knew that the subject was real but there were motivations which inadvertently m islead the public in order to gain m ore support to expand SETI research.

Scientists who know the UFO/ET issues are r eal (such as those who participate in covert research projects) should share the reality and their understanding with scientific colleagues to start to bring them up to speed. There will be a lot of catching up to do and it will be difficult because of reputations and funding issues; 3. Academ ic scientists should share this know ledge with their students and the public, for it is the next generation of students and gr aduate students that will help make the breakthroughs in research to explain what has been observed for several generations; 4. It is critical that scientists help m ake the study of UFO/ET issues a supported and encouraged area of scientific investigation for these future graduate students and young professional scientists; 5. Scientist/m anagers who run our federally funded academ ic research program s should set aside a sm all percentage of their budgets for ‘outside-the-box’ research into the UFO/ET arena, helping to m ake it a legitim ate area of research. 6. Finally , scientists should realize that adva nces in science and technology that could com e from an understanding of the UFO/ET phenom enon will have far ranging effects on the future of the people and the environm ent of our planet. The opportunities for new ‘breakthrough’ research have never been better (as well as the opportunity to rewrite m any textbooks). 355"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":" 4.6 Recommended Actions for the President of the United States Although Presidents since World War II have known about the reality of the UFO/ET issues, in recent decades their knowledge and ability to affect the issues have becom e lim ited. It is tim e for the president to take a proactive role in the disclosure process, because should significant disclosures occur without any presidential role, the president would be viewed by the Am erican public and the world in one of tw o perhaps equally dam aging way s. 1. If the President and the executive branch of the U.S. governm ent m aintain that they did not know any thing about a subject this im por tant, presidential stature and credibility would be significantly dam aged. 2. If the President and the executive branch maintain after “unsanctioned” disclosures that they knew of the subject and its incredible na tional significance, but were not connected to the disclosure, the President m ight be accused of supporting the cover-up, even though this may be unfair in light of the actual facts of how this subject has been covertly handled. Either way it behooves the President to begin the disclosure process with the following steps or one of the above dam aging options m ay becom e the prevailing view. 1. We recom mend that the President set fo rth an Executive Order releasing witnesses from national security oaths on this subject since a critical issue for witnesses willing to testify is their security oaths, even though they m ay have been illegally obtained (see section 4.7 on security oaths); 2. We recom mend that the President convene an independent, fair and open com mission to investigate the subject, USAPs connected to the subject, and technologies that are currently clarified and could benefit hum anity if released; 3. We recom mend at the sam e tim e that the Executive Order support the declassification of governm ent docum ents related to the UFO/ET subject, a process that has already begun through the Freedom of Inform ation Act (FOIA); 4. We also recom mend, as the disclosure pro cess proceeds, that the President issue an Executive Order providing am nesty for m embers of the suspected group and its personnel that control the UFO/ET issues, provided th at there is cooperation and non-interference by that group; 5. We recom mend that the President present a nationally televised talk on the issues and the process to start to restore public faith in the governm ent and dem ocratic principles; 6. Finally , we recom mend that the President create by Executive Order, a new scientific research organization to develop covert t echnologies that can be used to address our energy problem s and start to integrate these technologies into our m ainstream academ ic institutions. These Executive Orders would fully utilize the pow ers of the presidency to help term inate certain “black projects” activities that appear to be operating outside the constitutional chain of com mand. While certain aspects of extraterrestrial technology (and other matters) may not be fully accessed through this EO process, it woul d enable definite witness testim ony to be disclosed. This would start the process of neutralizing the present efforts by the covert groups to keep the President and the Executive branch, Congress, the press, and the taxpay ers out of the loop. 356"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"4.7 Amnesty Issues and Security Oaths 4.7.1 Why Amnesty? One of the m ajor stum bling blocks to disclosure is that those involved with the cover up are afraid of retribution once the governm ent and th e people realize the depth and extent of deceit that has occurred over the last half century . We citizens should not condone what those have done, but nor should we punish them . We citizens m ust be prepared to forgive. There is nothing to be gained by calling for severe retribution fo r those involved with either current or past secrecy . Although som e individuals have acted to end this secrecy , such as the witnesses who have contributed testim ony in sections 3.6 and 3. 8, many others may have felt they were doing the right thing at the tim e, which often continu es until today . Our world does not need a cosm ic Watergate, and we m ust collectively renounce it. We m ust be willing to look to the m oment and to the future, and forgive the past. Even t hough our culture wants to blam e and hold som eone accountable, we need to offer com plete am nesty to all those involved in suppressing the truth. There is international precedent for this approach, such as shown by South Africa in recent y ears. There is precedent in the US as well. For ex am ple, in the early day s of the Clinton Adm inistration, there were sweeping disclosures about past excesses and crazy experim ents within the Departm ent of Energy , and the form er Atom ic Energy Com mission. We learned of plutonium being put on the oatm eal of kids in orphanages, of deliberate radiation releases in populated areas to see ‘what would happen’ , and so forth.

Let us m ove forward, with som e real com passion and forgiveness, and begin this century anew. Our president must take the lead on this am nesty issue as was noted in the section on Recom mended Presidential Actions. It is our unde rstanding that the people of the United States are ready to m ove forward and as the say ing goes, if the people will lead, the leaders will follow. The stakes are too high to look the other way while our future is stolen from us. Courage, vision and perseverance are needed to transform this s ituation, and create a tim e of openness, trust and to lay the foundation for both global and inter-planeta ry peace.

Greer M.D., 21 October 1996 A num ber of first hand m ilitary , intelligence and governm ent-associated witnesses to covert projects dealing with UFOs and Extraterrestrial Intelligence (ETI) have been identified by the Disclosure Project’ s effort. Over the past thr ee y ears, we have locat ed several dozen such potential witnesses as part of a com prehensive strate gy to collect adequate evidence for a global, definitive disclosure on this subject. The story which these im portant governm ent witnesses can tell will m ake a credible, undeniable case for the reality of UFOs and the existence of extraterrestrial life form s in proxim ity to the Earth. One of the persistent obstacles to this testim ony com ing out into the public arena has been the issue of so-called national security oaths and r estrictions placed on these witnesses. Som e feel that they are not free to speak unless ‘released’ fro m these national security oaths and restrictions, and so we have been working to encourage Congress and the White House to take actions that would rem ove these restrictions. 357"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"In the sum mer of 1995, a num ber of these w itnesses gathered at a witnesses’ sum mit and signed a letter to President Clinton asking him to take actions leading to the release of these restrictions. While receipt of this letter was acknowledged by a special assistant to the President, we still await specific action from the executive bran ch of the US governm ent (Note that we still are waiting in 2001). With this said, it is im portant to visit the question of whether or not such national security oaths and restrictions are them selves legally valid. We have com pelling witness testim ony that the ope rations dealing with this subject currently exist, and have existed for several decades, outside of norm al governm ental projects. Mem bers of the Disclosure Project team have m et with very senior m embers of the Adm inistration, Congress, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the CIA a nd other relevant governm ent agency operatives. The picture which em erges from these discussions is that of an operation dealing with UFOs which is functioning outside of the norm al channe ls of governm ent, as it is usually considered. Indeed, we have found that the m ost senior leve ls of the executive branch, Congress, the m ilitary , etc. are totally out of the loop on this extraordinary m atter. This then brings up the sobering question of w ho is in the loop, and under what authorization are such projects operating? It is our assessm ent that for the large part, these operations do not fall under any constitutionally sanctioned avenues of authorization, and as such are, perforce, illegal. Aside from the lack of oversight and author ization from the executive branch and Congress, these operations have, from tim e to tim e, engaged in deceptive practices, which have frustrated the organs of constitutionally legal inquiries and dem ocratic processes. Any such operation which behaves in this fashion unilaterally rem oves itself from the inherent legality and protection which exists for projects which are c onsonant with constitutional law. This being the case (we are eager — nay , desperat e — for som eone to prove otherwise) all of the so-called “national security oaths” and othe r “restrictions” placed on m ilitary , intelligence and governm ent contract workers are null and void. Th at is, they appear to have no legal validity since the operations for which they were obtai ned are them selves illegal. In a constitutional dem ocracy , it is a basic requirem ent of law that such operations be constitu tionally legal, and if they are not, then all that flows from them — including such “oaths” — are illegal and therefore non-binding. IF these operations are legal, nobody in the Congress, executive branch or senior military with whom we have spoken knows of it. The production of a single current executive order or congressional directive authorizing these projects, which can be independently verified, would convince us otherwise. More than one covert contact has told us that, indeed, any such witnesses can and should speak out at the right tim e and place since no legal entity would — or legally could — do any thing about it. We agree. Bey ond this, it is the legal, m oral and patriotic duty of such witnesses to com e together, and at the highest, best and most credible venue possible, speak out in unison regarding the truth on this m atter. Granted, if only one or two such persons com e forward, the case will be weak, and the risk will be unacceptable. But if ten, twenty or m ore such witnesses com e together, and united, resolve to share their inform ation and experiences on this subject, then a definitive case will be m ade , and a great service to the world and their country will be fulfilled. The return of this m atter to the legal channe ls of governm ent and the deliberation of the people is one of the great unfulfilled tasks of the post cold war era. Over half a decade has elapsed since the end of the cold war, and there can no longer be a justification (if there ever was) 358"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"for this ty pe of extraordinary secrecy and cove rt agenda.

Far from being a legal viola tion of ‘security oaths’ , the public testim ony by such witnesses is a highly m oral and legal act. Furthe r, is it not true that the continuation of this secrecy itself is illegal and im moral, given the inherent unconstitutionality of such program s?

They are divided into three m ain topical sections consisting of: 1. Background and history ; 2. The need for disclosure; 3. The im plications of disclosure. Although they can be read in any sequence, in orde r to really grasp the depth and com plexity of the whole UFO/ET issue, we recom mend that y ou r ead them in the sequence they are listed. The sharp reader will find som e repetition in som e of th e articles a result of the fact they were written as standalone docum ents for different audiences over a several y ear period. In a num ber of the papers, our disclosure effort is m entioned. This refers to the m id-1990s efforts of the Disclosure Project to bring the whole UFO/ET issue to the attention of world leaders. The project held a m ajor closed congressional briefing in April, 1997 to urge congress to hold congressional hearings with witnesses in order to bring the reality of the subject to the attention of the m edia, governm ent, academ ics, and the public. No one in congress was brave enough to urge that hearings be held at that tim e.

Greer M.D., 22 August 1998 Abstract: Key m ilitary and national security leaders have been inadequately inform ed on the UFO/ETI subject due to its m anagem ent under Unacknow ledged Special Access Projects (USAPS). This lack of inform ation has resulted in substantial national security risks. The risk of inadequate and/or dangerous actions by uninf orm ed or m isinform ed leaders is greatly increased by the lack of in-depth briefings and discussions on this subject. Key areas of operational readiness are thus placed “at risk” by these leaders being dangerously uninform ed or m isinform ed on such m atters as the following: ¾ Use of Alien Reproduction Vehicles (ARVs) in false indications and warnings (I &W) scenarios; ¾ The unexpected appearance and disappearance of extraterrestrial vehicles with super- lum inal speed (faster than light) capabilities; ¾ Unanticipated extraterrestrial concern over deploy ment of space-based military and other assets. Senior m ilitary leaders and senior national secur ity leaders, including the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the National Security Council, Senior Watch Officers in the National Military Com mand Center, key Congressional leaders, the President, the Secretary of Defense, the Director of Central Intelligence, am ong others, clearly have a need-to-know regarding the issues above. Background and Introduction: Since 1990, the Disclosure Project, a non-profit research organization based in the United States, has been conducting original research into the subject of UFOs and Extraterrestrial Intelligence (ETI). In 1991, an initial Com prehe nsive Assessm ent was com pleted and since that tim e the Disclosure Project has been investigati ng the subject through real-tim e field expeditions throughout the world and through the identification of scientific evidence and inform ation sources with direct knowledge of the subject. Sources for our inform ation and subsequent assessm ents include: ¾ Direct, real-tim e observation of UFOs/Extraterrestrial Objects via field research team s deploy ed throughout the world; ¾ Collection of retrospective evidence with thousands of case reports, including military and civilian pilot encounters, m ilita ry and civilian radar contact with these objects, landing trace cases, photographic and videotape evidence and thousands of pages of declassified governm ent docum ents; ¾ Extensive interviews with several dozen scientists, military and civilian witnesses in intelligence and other program s and civilian research witnesses who have been 360"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"involved in covert program s. These w itnesses have had direct, personal knowledge of UFO/ETI events and covert program s, including the retrieval and reverse engineering of extraterrestrial spacecraft and the covert applications of technological breakthroughs resulting from possession of these spacecraft. The above sources and research have resulted in a num ber of assessm ents regarding the subject in general and national security im plica tions in particular. These are provided as separate attachm ents to this docum ent. Overview of UFO-Related USAPs: While tight com partm entation of intelligence a nd program s is often needed to m aintain security of sensitive operations, excessive classifi cation and com partm entation poses a threat to national security and m ilitary readiness and is contra ry to Presidential directives. In the case of the UFO/ETI subject, extrem e secrecy and m ultiple levels of special com partm entation has existed since the 1940s. This extrem e secrecy , together with the special nature of the technologies involved, has resulted in a potentially dangerous situation with respect to lack of oversight of actions not in the national interest , significant degradation in m ilitary readiness to deal with events related to ETI/UFO a nd total lack of Congressional oversight. The nature of the covert entity /USAP which cu rrently m anages the UFO m atter is described in the above paper “ Unacknowledged” in section 3.4. Briefly , this unusual USAP has the following characteristics: ¾ Global in scope; ¾ Multiple levels of sub-com partm entalization; ¾ Prim arily based in the civilian, priva tized contracting/work-for-others sectors; ¾ Runs parallel to and generally separate from conventional governm ent, m ilitary and intelligence program s, including other sensitive USAPs/black projects; ¾ Exists as a hy brid entity which draws from high technology corporations and com partm ented, governm ent, intelligence and military operations, but which in effect functions as an independent, separate entity ; ¾ Apparently is controlled by no single br anch of conventional governm ent, m ilitary service or agency ; ¾ In general, access to this project is by project-controlled inclusion and access has little to do with the individual’s position in governm ent, m ilitary rank or position in the traditional (constitutional) chain of com mand; ¾ After nearly 60 years of study ing advanced extraterrestrial technologies from retrieved ET devices, the group that controls this USAP possesses substantial technologies that m ay present a threat to conventional military assets and to world security in general; ¾ Funding for these operations is derived bot h from the so-called “black budget” and from “creative,” non-governm ental sources; ¾ Maintenance of secrecy /control over this pr oject has been at all costs and has consistently violated legal, constitutiona l oversight and checks and balances and the rights of U.S. citizens. Discussions with a sitting Director of Central Intelligence, senior White House staff, senior members of Congress serving on key , relevant com mittees, senior m ilitary staff in the US and 361"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"UK, am ong others, has shown that access to projects related to UFOs / ETI is not related to position or constitutional law. Five star Adm iral and form er UK Minister of Defense, Lord Hill- Norton has confirm ed that a sim ilar arrangem ent exists in the United Kingdom . Directed inquiry by such officials has not resulted in disclosure, even when the request or iginated from the office of the President of the United States. Why Key Military and National Security Leadership Need to Know: There are several inter-related aspects of the UFO/ETI issue, which necessitate key m ilitary , intelligence and national security leaders knowing about this m atter. Failure by such leaders to be adequately inform ed has resulted in a situation wherein im portant decisions and actions m ay be made which could result in extrem ely undesira ble outcom es. The capabilities of the UFO/ETI USAP allow for widespread deception of ch ain-of-com mand leadership and for surprise scenarios, which could be catastrophically m isinterpreted. Moreover, while there is no objective eviden ce that the non-hum an life form s behind the genuine extraterrestrial events are at all hostile towards the Earth or hum anity in general, events could be - and m ore im portantly we understand have been - negatively m isinterpreted, leading to unwarranted hum an m ilitary actions against such ET assets. Such actions constitute a genuine world security threat about which conventional military and civilian leadership is unaware. In order to avoid the potential for future hum an m ilitary actions, which could lead, to a dangerous escalation of events, it is im perative that m ilitary and national security leadership be adequately inform ed on this subject. Below is a brief sum mary of scenarios and activ ities, which illustrate why such leaders have an im mediate need to know on this m atter: ¾ Misidentification of UFO/Extraterrestrial assets . Since there are both genuine extraterrestrial and look-alike hum an engineered ARV (Alien Reproduction Vehicle) assets, the risk for confusion and m isidentifica tion is real. Such confusion could result in actions that could then lead to unintende d results (See also False Indications and Warnings below). ¾ Surprise by extraterrestrial object . In the past, senior military com manders have been surprised by the sudden appearance of extr aterrestrial objects and have taken hostile actions towards them . For exam ple, in Octobe r of 1981, such an object appeared off of the eastern seaboard, triggering pandem onium in the U.S. Atlantic Fleet (CINCLANTFLT) Com mand Center. This object, estim ated 300 feet in diam eter and disc shaped, was able to rapidly m ove, in one radar sweep from an area off the coast of Newfoundland to off the coast of Norfolk, Virgin ia. During this day light event, the U.S. Atlantic Fleet Com mand Center went to Condition Zebra alert (“Stripes”) and orders were given by NORAD to the CINC, ADM Harry Train, to identify this object and even force it down if necessary . Fighters were scram bled from land and sea-based forces and, while one fighter got close enough to clearly photograph the object, it m oved in the span of one radar sweep from off the coast of Norfo lk, Virginia to an area in the Atlantic Ocean near the Canary Islands, turned upward at a 60 degree angle, and left the Earth’ s atm osphere. This situation, which resu lted in surprise to the CINC, chaos on the Com mand Center Floor, and orders to for ce down the object (which could have had catastrophic consequences) could have been avoided with concept and scenario briefings to top m ilitary leaders and the developm ent of clear “Special Rules of Engagem ent” (ROEs) for these unique situations. 362"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":" ¾ Misinterpretation of Extraterrestrial Actions . It is our assessm ent that more that one extraterrestrial civilization is involved in reconnaissance of the Earth and in surveillance of global military developm ents. In the past , extraterrestrial concern over weapons of mass destruction has led to technological dem onstr ations at certain strategic sites, such as SAC ICBM facilities at Minot ND in Novem ber of 1975, which had its strategic launch capabilities inerted. Sim ilar neutralization, we understand, occurred in the USSR. While such an event would understandably generate hum an m ilitary concern, it is im portant for such events to be interpreted in a broade r context, which is non-anthropocentric. While one view m ay hold that this action dem onstrat ed extraterrestrial hostility , it is m ore likely that, given the event’ s non-violent nature, that it was intended to be a message of great concern over such globally destructive weapon system s. Unless leadership is adequately briefed on this subject, the potential for a catastrophic m isinterpretation of extraterrestrial actions and intentions exists. ¾ Extraterrestrial concern over space-based m ilitary assets . It is our understanding that the extraterrestrial view of hum an military assets being placed in space is very unfavorable and that in the recent past certain events have taken place which underscore this ET viewpoint. U.S. Space Com mand and other m ilitary entities dealing with space or which interface with and depend upon space-based assets need to be aware of this concern. It appears that ET concern is based on the incr easing m ilitarization of space, com bined with a continued high level of hum an warfare and violence and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. There is also reason to believe that covert USAP program s are targeting ET assets with increasing frequency and efficacy (see below). ¾ Multiple credible first-hand military and intelligence program witnesses have described covert USAP utilization of advanced weapons sy stem s to track, target and destroy extraterrestrial spacecraft. Such events have apparently increased in frequency and accuracy since the 1980s. If true, this constitutes a grave national and world security crisis about which key leaders have an urgent need to know. In light of the testim ony that we have heard, sim ple denials that such events are not occurring or are som ehow justified are not sufficient grounds to dism iss these reports or take a hands-off approach. Key military and national security leaders need to fully investigate this m atter and produce a full assessm ent of the situation for the National Com mand Authorities (NCA), the Chairm an, Joints Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), and key congressional leadership. ¾ Multiple, military and civilian witnesses involved in covert program s dealing with this subject and having first-hand personal knowledge have corrobor ated reports of UFO/ETI related USAPS’ intent to utilize reverse- engineered ET based technologies to stage (hoax) ET events of a violent nature. The existence of a very powerful covert USAP which possesses extraordinarily adva nced technologies capable of materialization/dem aterialization, faster-t han-light travel, antigravity propulsion and related sy stem s is in itself a direct threat to conventional and constitutional m ilitary and national security leadership and control. Su ch an entity , unless fully under direct, legal and constitutional chain of com mand oversight, a nd control, has great potential for abuse, deception and manipulation of traditional governm ental leadership. For exam ple, an im portant intelligence witness has described the planned use of ARVs in a false indications and warnings scenario in which the ARVs would attack conventional m ilitary assets to m ake it appear that we were being attacked by hostile extraterrestrial life form s. If m ilitary and national security leaders do not know of such covert hum an capabilities, 363"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"they could be deceived by such a scenario a nd could then issue orders for unwarranted and potentially catastrophic counter-m easures against genuine ET assets. ¾ Sub-electrom agnetic, non-linear com munications sy stem s of extraterrestrial origin which interface directly with consciousness and thought have been reverse-engineered by covert USAPs and can be used against civilian and m ilitary leadership in False I and W scenarios. Inform ation directly from a foreign head of state suggests that this has already occurred. Such non-linear telem etry system s, which by pass linear tim e/space and interface directly with m ind and thought can be m odified to induce hoaxed but very real experiences in target subjects. Senior m ilitary and civilian national security leaders need to know about the potential of these sy stem s, thus m inim izing the deceptive value of such system s should they be directed against them . (Alleged “Alien Abduction” experiences are largely the result of the m isuse of these sy stem s by covert USAPs.) ¾ NASA, civilian astronom ers and other scientists are increasingly concerned about the possibility of an Earth orbit-crossing asteroid or com et im pacting the Earth. Team s at JPL and elsewhere have already detected thou sands of such Earth orbit-crossing objects within our solar system . Large im pacts in the past have created what is now the Gulf of Mexico, Hudson Bay and other geological features on the surface of the Earth. Most scientists agree that it is not a question of ‘if, but ‘when’ , such an im pact will take place. Conventional scientists have discussed usi ng nuclear weapons a nd other conventional means to avert such an im pact. However, it is clear that UFO related USAPS possess technologies which are far m ore advanced a nd which could be brought to bear on this problem . This is especially true of gravity -altering technologies that could be used to change the mass effect of such an object and m ove it off of an Earth-intersecting course. Since such an im pact could potentially term inate hum an civilization as we know it, senior military and civilian national security leaders should have knowledge of and access to such UFO USAP related technologies. More over, use of such technologies in space for such a critical and beneficial purpose m ay be dependent on the perception by ET s that such space deploy ment would be only for peaceful purposes. We understand that this is not the current perception. Conclusions: ¾ Disclosure of the reality of the UFO/ETI subject and associated technologies would certainly alter m any aspects of life on Earth, including geopolitical relations, technology , econom ics and the general social order. Military and national security leaders unaware of the subject cannot adequately anticipate the far-reaching im plications of such a disclosure and would therefore be unprepared. Since the Disclosure Project and others are actively pursuing such a disclosure in the relatively near future, it is im portant that leaders understand these im plications fully and are able to respond to the challenges of such a disclosure in an orderly m anner. Should a sudden, undeniable extraterrestrial event occur, it is even m ore im portant that military and national security leaders be inform ed and are prepared to respond properly to the situation. ¾ The energy and propulsion technologies associated with extraterrestrial spacecraft utilize the zero-point field of energy , do not rely on nuclear or internal com bustion engines and are therefore non-polluting. One of the great ‘wild cards’ facing the military and national and world security lead ers is the eventual exhaustion of fossil fuels and the concom itant decay in the Earth’ s ecosy stem . With the rapid industrialization of China, India and m uch of the third world, the dam age to the 364"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"Earth’ s ecosy stem will only accelerate exponentially , even as the fuel sources are more rapidly dim inished. Currently , we exist as a term inal technological civilization - a serious long-term security issue indeed. However, the covert USAP responsible for UFO/ETI m atters has already reversed-engineered energy and propulsion system s which render the internal com bustion engi ne obsolete. We estim ate that this breakthrough occurred between 1954 and 1957. Ben Rich of Lockheed Skunkworks, prior to his death, confirm ed to a Disclosure Project consultant that “we already have the m eans to travel am ong the stars, but these technologies are locked up in black projects and it would take an act of God to ever get them out to benefit hum anity ...” Long term national security planning necessitates the eventual (and preferably near- term ) release of these technologies for the benefit of m ankind and the preservation of the planet. Certainly national security and m ilitary leaders should understand these technologies, which will replace the entire global energy and internal com bustion infrastructure. Moreover, they should anticip ate the im plications related to the release of such technologies so that the transition to sustainable energy sy stem s can be as sm ooth and peaceful as possible. These are a few of the national security and m ilitary im plications of the UFO/ETI subject — any one of which justifies a full briefing to leadership on the subject. Recommendations: We recom mend senior m ilitary and national security leaders take the following actions: ¾ Receive a thorough briefing on the subject by Disclosure Project leadership and military /civilian witnesses ¾ Fully brief CINCS, and develop speci al ROEs for ETI/UFO encounters. ¾ Independently investigate the subject and penetrate USAP operations related to the subject ¾ Becom e fully involved in covert projects rela ted to the subject to ensure that such projects are adequately supervised and are under the direct and continuous control of the constitutional chain of com mand ¾ Correct and/or restrain any USAPS’s covert m isuse of advanced technologies or weapon sy stem s related to UFOs. ¾ Attem pt peaceful, cooperative engagem ent of these life form s and assiduously avoid violent military engagem ent. The Disclosure Project has a prototy pe project which was been peacefully engaging ETI for over 7 y ears and suggests that national and international leaders adopt a sim ilar approach ¾ Carefully consider the deploy ment of space-based m ilitary assets in light of the above inform ation and avoid actions, which m ay be viewed as bellicose or hostile by extraterrestrial life form s. 5.2 National Security Implications of the UFO/ETI Subject: A Brief Summar y copy right Steven M. Greer, MD 30 August 1995 National Security Im plications of the UFO/ETI subject are profound and far-reaching, albeit currently largely unrecognized. 365"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"These im plications m ay be considered in separ ate but related aspects: those intrinsic to ET activity and those arising from current covert m anagem ent of the issue. Historical Background: Early National Security considerations dealt with concern over public panic arising from the detection of near Earth and Earth-landed ex traterrestrial spacecraft (ETS) and from the technological im plications of advanced Extraterr estrial m aterial as it m ay im pact the arm s race and cold war. Additional concerns were relate d to the im pact on religious belief sy stem s, the political order and econom ic sy stem s. Im portantly , once actual ETS were retrieved in 1947, thereby allowing Extraterrestrial hardware to be studied and back- engineered fo r possible hum an m ilitary applications, the need for com plete secrecy regarding the m atter was deem ed param ount by authorities at that tim e. Given the tensions of the early atom ic era a nd the m ounting “cold war” with the USSR, it is understandable that the introduction of Extraterrest rial technology was thought to be destabilizing to an already dangerous situation. Moreover, gi ven the history of technological secrets related to atom ic and hy drogen weapons be ing stolen by agents of the USSR, there was understandable concern that any technological breakthrough related to Extraterrestrial technology m ight find its way into Soviet hands. If such an event enable d the USSR to produce actual m ilitary applications before the US, obviously this would have placed the US m ilitary capability in a potentially catastrophic disadvantage. Since the 1970’ s, we have reason to believe th at a degree of cooperation on this m atter has evolved with the USSR and the US and perhaps other nations. Certainly the end of the cold war has largely rem oved earlier concerns vis a vis technological breakthroughs and the fear of Soviet aggression. Moreover, the psy chological reasons for secrecy related to public panic are not valid today . At least 57% of the population accept that UFOs are real and are of Extraterrestrial origin. And 30-40 y ears of space exploration by hum an society has prepared the population for the possible existence of other Extraterrestrial civilizations capable of space travel. In short, the previous concerns m otivating secrecy are not relevant today . Intrinsically , there is no reason to believe that the Extraterrestrial presence poses a threat to the national or world security . If hostility and aggr ession were related to their purpose here, it is likely that events congruent with hostility would have transpired long before now. It is our assessm ent that the Extraterrestrials are not hostile , but are very concerned with hum an capability related to warfare and the m ilitarization of space. Activity by Extraterrestrial assets related to the neutralization of ICBM facilities and to containi ng m ilitary oriented space exploration should be understood in light of their concern over a known history of hum an aggression that has been coupled with the advent of weapons of mass dest ruction and space exploration. Indeed, given the past history of hum an m ilitary assets focusing on and pursuing Extraterrestrial Spacecraft, we believe the Extraterrestrials have r esponded with rem arkable restraint. Ironically , the threat to national security exists not with the Extraterrestrial presence, but the current covert m anagem ent of the subject . In the absence of Extraterrestrial hostility over 50 years , current secrecy cannot be justified on the basis of fear of Extraterrestrial aggression. A disclosure related to the Extraterrestrial presence, if calm ly and rationally presented, will not cause public panic in the US or elsewhere. 1995 is not 1945, and world society has evolved to the point where this inform ation can be assim ilated in a positive fashion. 366"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"In contrast, the covert and apparently extra-c onstitutional m anagem ent of this m atter is a real threat to national and world security , and unde rm ines constitutional freedom and dem ocracy .

It is our assessm ent that the current covert m anagem ent of this issue involves the following elem ents which are a direct, im mediate and ongoing threat to the national security : 1. The continued denial of the Extraterrest rial presence creates a situation where a sudden, undeniable, public Extraterrestrial event coul d induce panic, since proactive disclosure efforts, which could am eliorate public fears, are non-existent. It is likely that such a public Extraterrestrial event will transpire within the next 2-10 y ears or sooner. Therefore secrecy and denial are a real threat to national and world security . 2. The current covert m anagem ent of this issue appears to be operating independently and outside of the constitutional chain of co mmand. The group controlling these operations, which involve reconnaissance, Extraterrestri al technology reverse-engineering, and space-based targeting of ETS (am ong others ) is non-responsive to congressional or Executive branch oversight and control. This constitutes a real threat to the national security and to constitutional dem ocracy and freedom . 3. We have credible, first hand sources who insi st that extraterrestrial spacecraft have been targeted by hum an covert space weapons and on at least two occasions have been destroy ed. If true, the risks to world peace and security are real and im minent, and the continuation of these covert activities constitu tes the gravest dangers to national and world security . Hostile actions taken by hum an covert assets against Extraterrestrial assets constitute a grave and im mediate threat to the national security . A relatively sm all, covert entity , acting without consultation with the United Nations, the Congress, the President of the United States or the public is engaging in actions on behalf of all hum ans which endanger the Earth and world peace. Unless controlled, these actions could precipitate interplanetary conflict and a di saster for the world generally and the United States specifically . This covert managem ent must be term inated and control of this issue returned to constitutional authority and to the public dom ain. 4. The concentration of the technological adva nces related to the reverse-engineering of Extraterrestrial technology into the hands of a sm all covert operation constitutes a threat to the national security , to world security and to the future of the Earth. These Extraterrestrial technologies, which have been the object of covert research and developm ent for over 45 y ears, are potentially of great benefit to hum anity if used wisely for peaceful purposes, but are of im mense dange r when concentrated into a sm all covert operation that is unresponsive to the pubic or the legal and constitutional chain of com mand. The threat this poses to the US a nd world security is great, and the longer this situation continues, the greater the concentr ation of advanced technological power in the hands of a relative few.

Its utilization for covert agendas outside constitutional control represents a grave danger to our country and m ust be restrained and reversed. 5.

To do so is to underm ine th e US Constitution, dem ocracy and freedom , and this constitutes a serious threat to the national security . 6. Finally , exclusive covert control of this m atter has resulted and continues to result in the loss of opportunity for the world to com e to term s with the Extraterrestrial presence in a peaceful and m utually beneficial fashion. Th is m eans that the people of the world, the United Nations and other inte rnational and national institutions are deprived of the opportunity to deal rationally with this issue. National and world security are therefore negatively im pacted by the loss of opportunities in the following areas: ¾ The Environm ent, which is seriously at risk for large-scale collapse over the next 100 y ears, would be profoundly im proved if extraterrestrial technologies could be peacefully deploy ed. So-called zero point or free energy sy stem s, which are non-polluting, would perm it a sustainable technological civilization to exist on Earth and would transform the Earth environm entally and econom ically . Establishing peaceful and m utually benefi cial relations with extraterrestrial civilizations would eventually perm it us to understand and apply such technologies. ¾ World unity and peace will be enhanced by the global realization that we are not alone in the universe. The acknowledgem ent of this fact will enhance the awareness that we are really one people living on the shared hom eland of Earth, and many of the conflicts currently afflicting the Earth will be seen in a new perspective. This can be achieved wit hout either deify ing or dem onizing the extraterrestrial presence, but rather placing it in a fair, scientific and neutral light. Eventually , world peace and a significant enhancem ent in the current geopolitical situation may result from the disclosure that we are not alone. An international infrastructure, and institutions capable of dealing peacefully with relations with extraterrestrial civilizations would, of necessity , evolve, and this in turn would strengthen world unity and cooperation. ¾ World culture, ideas, science and m any other diverse areas may benefit through the developm ent of peaceful relations with other worlds. While this process may take decades, if not centuries, its delay only puts off the tim e when the people of the Earth will be united not only globally , but with other planetary civilizations as well.

Greer M.D., October 2000 The ultim ate national security issue is intim ately linked to the pressing environm ental crisis facing the world today : The question of whether hum anity can continue as a technologically advanced civilization. Fossil fuels and the internal com bustion engine are non-sustainable both environm entally and econom ically - and a replacem ent for both already exists. The question is not whether we will transition to a new post-fossil fuel econom y, but when and how. The environm ental, econom ic, geopolitical, national security and m ilitary issu es related to this m atter are profound and inextricably linked to one another. The disclosure of such new energy technologies will have far-reaching im plications for every aspect of hum an society and the tim e has com e to prepare for such an event. For if such technologies were announced today , it would take at least 10-20 y ears for their widespread application to be effected. This is approxi mately how much tim e we have before global econom ic chaos begins due to dem and far exceedi ng the supply of oil and environm ental decay becom es exponential and catastrophic. We have found that the technologies to replace foss il fuel usage already exist and need to be exploited and applied im mediately to aver t a serious global econom ic, geopolitical and environm ental crisis in the not-so-distant future. In sum mary, these technologies fall into the following broad categories: ¾ Quantum vacuum /zero point field energy access sy stem s and related advances in electrom agnetic theory and applications; ¾ Electrogravitic and m agnetogravitic energy and propulsion; ¾ Room tem perature nuclear effects; ¾ Electrochem ical and related advances to in ternal com bustion sy stem s, which achieve near zero em issions and very high efficiency . A num ber of practical applications using su ch technologies have been developed over the past several decades, but such breakthroughs have been either ignored due to their unconventional nature — or have been classified and suppressed due to national security , m ilitary interests and “special” interests. Let us be clear: the question is not whether such sy stem s exist and can be viable replacem ents for fossil fuels. The question is whether we have the courage to allow such a transform ation in world society to occur. Such technologies — especially those that by pass the need to use an exte rnal fuel source such as oil or coal — would have obvious and beneficial effects for hum anity . Since these technologies do not require an expensive source of fuel but instead use existing quantum space 369"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":" energy , a revolution in the world’ s econom ic and social order would result. These im plications include: ¾ The rem oval of all sources of air pollution related to energy generation, including electric power plants, cars, trucks, aircraft and m anufacturing; ¾ The ability to “scrub” to near zero effluent all m anufacturing processes since the energy per se required for sam e would have no cost related to fuel consum ption. This would allow the full application of technol ogies, which would rem ove effluent from sm okestacks, solid waste from waterway s, b ecause current applications are generally restricted by their energy costs and the fact that such energy consum ption — being fossil fuel based — soon reaches the point of dim inishing returns environm entally ; ¾ The practical achievem ent of an environm entally near-zero im pact y et high tech civilization on Earth, thus assuring the long-term sustainability of hum an civilization; ¾ Trillions of dollars now spent on electric power generation, gas, oil, coal and nuclear power would be freed to be spent on more productive and environm entally neutral endeavors by both individuals and society as a whole; ¾ Underdeveloped regions of the Earth would be lifted out of poverty and into a high technology world in about a generation — but without the associated infrastructure costs and environm ental im pact relate d to traditional energy generation and propulsion. Since these new sy stem s generate energy from the am bient quantum energy state, trillion dollar infrastructure investm ents in centralized power generation and distribution would be elim inated. Re mote villages and towns would have the ability to generate energy for m anufacturing, electrification, water purification etc without purchasing fuels or building m assive transm ission lines and central power grids; ¾ Near total recy cling of resources and m aterials would be possible since the energy costs for doing so — now the m ain obstacle — would be brought down to a trivial level; ¾ The vast disparity between rich and poor na tions would quickly disappear — and with it m uch of the zero-sum -gam e m entality which is at the root of so m uch social, political and international unrest. In a world of abundant and inexpensive energy , m any of the pressures that have led to a cy cle of poverty , exploitation, resentm ent and violence would be rem oved from the social dy nam ic. While ideological, cultural and religious differences would persist, the raw econom ic disparity and struggle would be rem oved from the equation fairly quickly ; ¾ Surface roads — and therefore m ost road building — will be unnecessary as electrogravitic / antigravity energy and propulsion sy stem s replace current surface transportation sy stem s; ¾ The world econom y would expand dram atically and those advanced econom ies such as in the US and Europe would benefit trem endously as global trade, developm ent and high technology energy and propulsion devices are dem anded around the world.

Lest all of this sound like a pipe dream , keep in m ind that such technological advances are not only possible, but they already exist . What is lacking are the collective will, creativity and courage to see that they are applied wisely . And therein lies the problem . As an em ergency and traum a doctor, I know that every thing can be used for good or for ill. A knife can butter y our bread — or cut y our throat. Every technology can have beneficial as well as harm ful applications. The latter partially explains the serious nati onal security and m ilitary concerns with such technologies. For many decades, these advances in energy and propulsion technologies have been acquired, suppressed and classified by certain interests who have viewed them as a threat to our security from both an econom ic and m ilitary perspec tive. In the short term , these concerns have been well-founded: Why rock the global econom ic boat by allowing technologies out which would, effectively , term inate the m ulti-trillion dolla r oil, gas, coal, internal com bustion engine and related transportation sectors of the ec onom y? And which could also unleash such technologies on an unstable and dangerous world where the weapons applications for such technological breakthroughs would be a certainty ? In the light of this, the status quo looks good. But only for the short term . In fact, such national security and m ilitary policies -fed by huge special interests in obvious industries and nations — have exacerbated global geopolitical tensions by im poverishing much of the world, worsening the zero-sum -gam e m ind set of the rich vs. poor nations and brought us to a world energy em ergency and a pending environm ental crisis. And now we have very little tim e to fix the situation. Such thinking m ust be relegated to the past. For what can be a greater threat to the nationa l security than the specter of a collapse of our entire civilization from a lack of energy and globa l chaos as every nation fights for its share of a lim ited resource? Due to the long lead-tim e needed to transform the current industrial infrastructure away from fossil fuels, we are f acing a national security em ergency , which alm ost nobody is talking about. This is dangerous. It has also created a serious constitutional crisis in the US and other countries where non- representative entities and super- secret projects within com partm ented m ilitary and corporate areas have begun to set national and international policy on this and relate d m atters — all outside the arena of public debate, and m ostly without inform ed consent from Congress or the President. Indeed this crisis is underm ining dem ocracy in the US and elsewhere. I have had the unenviable task of personally briefing senior po litical, m ilitary , and intelligence officials in the US and Europe on this and related m atters . These officials have been denied access to inform ation com partm ented within certain proj ects that are, frankly , unacknowledged areas (so- called “black” projects). Such officials include m embers of the House and Senate, President Clinton’s first Director of Central Intelligence, the head of the DIA, senio r Joint Staff officials and others. Usually , the officials have little to no inform ation on such projects and technologies - and are told either nothing or that they do not have a “need to know” if they specifically inquire. This presents then another problem : these technologies will not be suppressed forever. For exam ple, our group is planning a near term discl osure of such technologies and we will not be silenced. At the tim e of such a disclosure, will the US governm ent be prepared? It would 371"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":" behoove the US governm ent and others to be in form ed and have a plan for transitioning our society from fossil fuels to these new energy and propulsion sy stem s.

Econom ic and i ndustrial interests should be prepared so that those aspects of our econom y that will be adversely affected (com modities, oil, gas, coal, public utilities, engine manufacturing, etc.) can be cushione d from sudden reversals and be econom ically “hedged” by investing in and supporti ng the new energy infrastructure. A creative view of the future — not fear and suppression of such technologies — is required. And it is needed im mediately . If we wait 10 – 20 m ore y ears, it will be too late to m ake the needed changes before world oil shortages, exorbitant costs and geopolitical com petition for resources causes a m elt-down in the world’ s econom y and political structures. All system s tend towards hom eostasis. The status quo is com fortable and secure. Change is frightening. But in this case, the m ost dangerous course for the national security is inaction. We must be prepared for the com ing convulsions rela ted to energy shortages, spiraling costs and econom ic disruption. The best preparation would be a replacem ent for oil and related fossil fuels. And we have it. But disclosing these new energy system s carries its own set of benefits, risks and challenges. The US governm ent and the Congress m ust be prepared to wisely m anage this great challenge. Recommendations for Congress: ¾ Thoroughly investigate these new technologies both from current civilian sources as well as com partm ented projects within m ilitary , intelligence and corporate contracting areas; ¾ Authorize the declassification and release of inform ation held within com partm ented projects related to this subject; ¾ Specifically prohibit the seizing or suppression of such technologies; ¾ Authorize substantial funding for basic research and developm ent by civilian scientists and technologists into these areas; ¾ Develop plans for dealing with disclosing such technologies and for the transition to a non-fossil fuel econom y. These plans should include: m ilitary and national security planning; strategic econom ic planning and preparation; private sector support and cooperation; geopolitical planning, especially as it pertains to OPEC countries and regions whose econom ies are very dependent on oil exports and the price of oil; international cooperation and security ; am ong others. I personally stand ready to assist the Congress in any way possible to facilitate our use of these new energy sources. Having dealt with this and related sensitive m atters for over 10 y ears, I can recom mend a num ber of individuals who can be subpoenaed to provide testim ony on such technologies, as well as people who have inform ation on unacknowledged special access projects within covert governm ent operations that are already dealing with these issues. If we face these challenges with courage and with wisdom together, we can secure for our children a new and sustainable world, free of poverty and environm ental destruction.

In a recent book on UFO issues, reporter and writer Jim Marrs 38 states the following at the start of his Introduction (p. x): “The controversy over the existence of UFOs is over. UFOs are real. Only those persons whose outlook prevents them from dealing honestly with the m assive am ounts of docum entation and reports collected over the p ast five decades still cling to the idea that nothing soars in the skies of Earth exception m an’s im agination.” Well, where is this “m assive am ounts of docum entation” and why is it not m ore widely known? It is all around us, y ou just have to look. At present there is a boom in inform ation about UFOs available to the public. For exam ple, as of February 2001, Am azon Booksellers listed 581 books under the search criteria of UFO on their web site. For the more research oriented, there are several large com pilations of sightings available. One of the largest com puter databases of UFO sightings in the public dom ain is UFOCAT2000, which has over 109,000 UFO reports a nd related inform ation. As described on their web site ( http://www.cufos.org/UFOCAT.htm l ), the UFOCAT is the result of a 30-y ear effort that began during the Air Force sponsored Colorado UFO Project, also known as the “Condon Com mittee.” UFOCAT was begun by Dr. David R. Saunders, who at the tim e was a co- Principal Investigator on the Colorado UFO study and professor of Psy chology at the University of Colorado. Another major com puterized source of sighting inform ation is the com pilation entitled “* U* Database,” which as of February , 2001 contains over 17,750 carefully filtered UFO events com piled from over 365 book, newspapers, periodical s and private sources. Inform ation about this database can be found on the web at Larry Hatch’ s web site: http:// www.jps.net/larryhat . For the last few y ears, retired Air Force Captain George Filer 39 com piled and published (through em ail) UFO sighting reports, m any with editorial com ment, from around the US and the world. These are sent out on nearly a weekly basis. His reports for the last four y ears 1997 through 2000 are available on a CD from : Majorstar@aol.com . For contem porary sighting’ s inform ation nearly as they happen, the National UFO Research Center (NUFORC) run by Peter Davenport (web site: http://www.m satech.com /nuforc ) provides good inform ation on what people are reporting to them and a searchable database covering reports over the past several y ears. What do th ese reports represent in term s of what people are actually seeing? Peter Davenport reported to us in a recent em ail that NUFORC receives on average 10-20 reports a day with a range of half a dozen to m any dozens a day . He states: “Given that probably only one in 100 reports is recorded any where, that statistic provides som e insight into how m any UFO sightings occur per day .

For m ost of these incidences there are governm ent docum ents and they are referenced and included in Appendix I at the e nd of this briefing docum ent. 6.2 UFO Sightings Prior to the 1940s Although the m odern age of UFO sightings is c onsidered by m any to have begun with the publicity surrounding pilot Kenneth Arnold’s June 25, 1947 sighting of nine saucer-like objects in Washington State, objects we now would call UFOs have been described throughout recorded history . Several events described in the bi ble and in ancient Vedic literature have been considered by scholars to be UFO descriptions. A recent Reader’ s Digest book on “My steries of the Unexplained” reports descriptions of sigh tings from ancient Egy pt, Rom an writings, as well as writings from the Middle Ages both from Europe a nd Japan. Jim Marrs also describes som e of these early sightings in his book. 40 Many of these reports have been reviewed num erous tim es by UFO writers and will not be dealt with here. For an excellent historical review of the UFO issues since WWII up to the mid 1980s, see Above Top Secret by Tim othy Good. Since our governm ent’ s interest in UFOs and m aintaining secrecy about them began in earnest in the 1940s, the best available evid ence cases start there. 6.3 1942 - 1945: The Present Era of UFO Sightings Begins Som e of the earliest case histories com e from military officers in the early 1940s. In 1942, a photographer had set up on a busy street in China. With his large cam era, he hoped to take photographs of visitors, which they would purch ase as a souvenir. Suddenly , his attention was drawn to the sky , along with m any others on the st reet. There, hovering silently was a large, dark disc-shaped object. The quick-thinking photographer focused his cam era on the disc and obtained an excellent, clear photo of it. A m ilitary officer serving in the Chinese cam paign prior to World War II was present on the street as well. He bought the photograph and apparently tucked it into a scrapbook of photographs he coll ected while stationed in China. It went unnoticed for years until a Japanese gentlem an discovered the old album containing the 1942 photograph. 41 In August of 1942, U.S. Marine Sergeant Ste phen Brickner was stationed in the Solom on Islands. He witnessed the appearance of m ultiple unconventional, although loud, fly ing objects.   40 Marrs, Jim. 1997.

Beginning in 1943, pilots fly ing over the Indian Ocean, Germ any and elsewhere reported sim ilar events, stating that the \"balls of fire\" raced across the sky at fantastic speeds. While it was suspected th at the Nazis were fly ing som e sort of m issiles, rockets or electro-gravitic devices, intelligence efforts eventually surm ised th at the Nazis were also being tagged by these odd balls of light. Reportedly , an Am erican pilot paraphrased a com ic strip title from the day and stated “Where there’ s foo, there’ s fire.” 44 The term “foo fighters” was coined and stuck. Am erican Air Force pilots and intelligence offi cers fly ing over Germ any , and particularly the Rhine Valley , radioed to the Am erican radar cen ter instances of seeing dozens of red or orange lights, flares or possible Nazi night fighters, “kraut fighters” or “kraut balls.” The radar center, however, reported to the pilots that the radar screen showed the m ilitary plane to be alone in its airspace. Rather than being an isolated incide nt, the balls of light reappeared with increasing frequency throughout 1943 and 1944. 45 Indeed, in 1944, two P-47 pilots each observed a “foo fighter” in broad day light. Fly ing near Neusta dt, Germ any , one pilot reported observing “a gold- colored ball with a m etallic finish.” The second pilot, also fly ing near Neustadt, described “a phosphorescent golden sphere” with a diam eter of three to five feet. In May of 1945, Am erican soldier Ly nn R. Mom o described “a fireball of rather startling nature” over Ohrdorf, Germ any : It was brighter than any star, or even the planet Venus. It passed com pletely from horizon to horizon in about two seconds. The path was thr ough the zenith, so that whatever its altitude, its speed m ust have been enorm ous. Mom o went on to state that the object was soundless and had a “rising and sinking” or bobbing motion as it traversed from horizon to horizon. Mom o said it rem inded him of the reflection from a m irror that, when held in the hand, causes the reflected light to bounce erratically with the slightest movem ent. “A sim ilar device was em ploy ed in World War II to project im ages of religious scenes on the clouds to frighten superstitious enem y soldiers. It was quite successful until they caught on,” Mom o reported. 46 The late Am erican journalist Frank Edwards cited a report by Major E.R.T. Holm es from England which sum marized sightings by B- 17 bom ber pilots of the 384th Group during a bom bing run on the Schweinfurt, Germ any indus trial com plex on October 14, 1943.

As with the nature and origin of these enigm atic fly ing objects, the report and its nam esake rem ain a m ystery to the present day . 48 6.4 New Mexico Crash Retrieval and Landing Cases According to an article in the April 1, 1966 issue of Life m agazine, between June 1947 and early 1966, 10,147 UFO sightings had been reported. 49 The term \"fly ing saucers\" itself sprang from private pilot Kenneth Arnold’s experi ence on June 24, 1947 near Mount Rainier, Washington. He saw a form ation of nine rapidly m oving disc-shaped objects while fly ing in a sm all plane. In the wild publicity and wave of sightings that followed during the sum mer of 1947, the term \"fly ing saucers\" was coined by the popular press. The Roswell Incident: On July 2, 1947, an object crashed into a rem ote field on rancher William \"Mac\" Brazel’ s land. Mr. Brazel reported hearing a loud explosion during a severe thunderstorm . The next m orning, he discovere d debris scattered over an area which m ay have spanned fifty acres. Mr. Brazel notified the local sheriff’ s office who in turn called the Arm y. The case created a stir when the 509th Bom b Group at the Arm y Air Force Base at Roswell Field, New Mexico, officially released to the press th e astounding story that a fly ing saucer had crashed near Roswell. The Public Inform ation Officer at the base who released the story to the press was First Lieutenant Walter Haut, who still lives in Rosw ell. The Roswell Daily Record ran the story on the front page in bold headlines: \"RAAF Captures Fly ing Saucer on Ranch in Roswell Region.\" Two day s later, the Arm y recanted, issuing a second press release claim ing that only a weather balloon had crashed. Major Jesse Marcel, a staff intelligence officer at Roswell Field, was assigned to the recovery operation. To bolster the “validity ” of the second press release, a press conference was held in Fort Worth, Texas, where the debris was first taken, and a photograph of Major Marcel kneeling to exam ine rem nants of a torn, silvery weather balloon was released. This balloon was eventually declared by the Air Force to be a \"Mogul balloon\" — balloons which carried top secret acoustical apparatus designed to “listen” for evidence of Soviet nuclear bom b testing. The Mogul was actually designed so that a string of m uch larger balloons kept it airborne. It bore little resem blance to a sole weather balloon. However, a major military retrieval effort resulted from this alleged “crash” of a balloon.

The recovered debris was flow n under deep cover first to Carswell Air Force Base in Fort Worth, Texas and ultim ately to Wright Field (now Wright-Patterson Air Force Base) in Ohio. It is difficult to im agine any sort of balloon configuration spreading debris over a fifty - acre area, or requiring a top-secret operation to retrieve the pieces. During the early phase of the retrieval operati on, Major Marcel showed som e pieces of the debris to his fam ily , adm onishing them never to discuss it. The late Major Marcel’ s son, Col. Jesse Marcel, Jr., M.D., is a witness who is part of Disclosure Project. Dr. Marcel clearly rem embers his father calling the fam ily around the kitchen table that night. Dr. Marcel, then twelve years old, was shown item s from the crash site, particularly sm all beam s of lightweight material, lavender to purple in color, with hierogly phic-like m arkings along its length. Dr. Marcel had a model m ade to his specifications from his vivid recollections as a 12-y ear old boy when he held and exam ined the m aterial. Another witness who was on President Eisenhower ’s staff recounts being shown two sections of the sm all I-beam s and a piece of foil-like m aterial when he was in cry ptography training in a basem ent office in the Pentagon in 1960-61. He w as told that the m ateri al “cam e from the crash of a UFO;” he was not told from where and was not allowed to handle the material. He recalls being told that the m etal foil could not be pierced, cut or burned. Our witness also clearly recalls hierogly phic m arkings along the length of one of the sm all beam s. 50 Roswell dwelled in the realm of rum or until 1978 when the late Major Jesse Marcel appeared on an NBC radio program and talked about the offi cial debris retrieval at the crash site near Roswell. Major Marcel stated the following in an interview by nuclear phy sicist and UFO researcher Stanton Friedm an: “... that afternoon, we loaded every thing into a B-29 on orders from Colonel Blanchard and flew it all to Ft. Worth. I was scheduled to fly it all the way to Wright Field in Ohio, but when we got to Carswell at Ft. Worth, the general nixed it. He took control at this point, and ordered me not to talk to the press under any circum stances. I was pulled off the flight and someone else was assigned to fly the stuff up to Wright Field ...” 51 Why Roswell? Quite sim ply, because the 509th was the only m ilitary facility in the country , and m ost likely in the world, holding nuclear warheads. Other Crash Sites: Whether the Roswell crash actually occurred near Roswell, or at another location in New Mexico, particularly Magdalena or Socorro (the Plains of San Agustin), Corona, or Aztec, rem ains in dispute, and whether there was only one or m ore than one crash of a possible extraterrestrial spacecraft in New Mexico has y et to be proven. In 1997, som e of the best-known investigators of the Roswell crash reversed thei r opinions and claim ed they no longer believed an extraterrestrial spacecraft crashed in Roswell but rather it was either a balloon-tethered device or a highly classified atom ic-powered military prototy pe craft. However, witness testim ony as outlined above, as well as statem ents given to the Disclosure Project by other form er m ilitary witnesses, confirm that there were several crashes in the southwestern United States in the late 1940s and 1950s. These witnesses and evidence uncovered over the y ears by several UFO researchers point to crashes of extraterrestrial space craft at these sites, along with Roswell: in or   50 Disclosure Project transcripts of cl osed witness meetings; June 1995 and April 1997. 51 Berlitz and Moore, The Roswell Incident , Granada, London 1980. 377"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":" near Aztec, New Mexico; Kingm an, Arizona; th e Great Sand Dunes of Colorado, inside the Mexican border near Laredo, Texas; and Paradise Valley (near what is now Carefree), Arizona. There is also a report by researchers Tom my Blann and Leonard Stringfield of a crash in Northern New Mexico in 1962. This pair of researchers also reported on a UFO on the ground at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base the sam e y ear, 1962, under heavy guard in a hangar. 52 Regardless of the precise location of any of po ssible crashes, there is a significant body of evidence, including docum ents obtained from the U.S. governm ent through the Freedom of Inform ation Act (\"FOIA\") which clearly indicate that secret retrieval operations occurred. It stretches the credulity to im agine that such closely -guarded operations would be necessary for a weather balloon, if we are to believe the second press release out of Roswell in July of 1947. But an effort to obtain those docum ents sp earheaded by Rep. Steven Schiff (R-NM) culm inated in a disappointing dead end. Re p. Schiff sent requests through the GAO (Governm ent Accounting Office) for any and all docum entation regarding the crash of an airborne object in New Mexico in 1947. The GAO representatives perfo rm ed a search and were unable to provide Rep. Schiff with any docum entation. However, other requests through the CIA a nd FOIA produced a m emorandum dated March 22, 1950 from the Director of the FBI stating that three fly ing saucers had been recovered in New Mexico (REF TO LETTER). Also two m emoranda from October and Novem ber of 1947 state that a study was underway at Wright Field of fly ing saucers recently sighted over the United States, and that models were being constructed to be tested in a wind tunnel . The New Mexico crash investigations have y ielded persistent stories of extraterrestrial biological entities (\"EBEs\") who perished in or shortly after the crashes and whose bodies have been shuttled from one secret m ilitary base to anothe r since the late 1940s. When we add into the equation the testim ony of m ultiple living witnesses, or whose close fam ily members confessed on their death beds, that sm all nonhum an life form s were found at the crash sites, one or m ore of which m ay have been still alive at the tim e they were found, we have at m inim um cases which cry for thorough scientific investigation with all of the docum ents released for review. The Socorro Landing Case - 1964: Lonnie Zam ora, a police sergeant in Socorro, New Mexico, reported the sighting of a UFO on the ground — com plete with landing traces and sm all hum anoid life form s. The incident occurred on April 24, 1964 and was the subject of official investigations by the Air Force, the FBI, and private investigations by other researchers, am ong them Dr. J. Allen Hy nek. This incident is the first reported in the official Air Force UFO records involving landing traces and the sighting of hum anoid life form s. 53 During day light hours while on duty that day , Sgt. Zam ora was in hot pursuit of a black Chevrolet which he first saw speeding past the So corro courthouse. He pursued the vehicle north along US Highway 85 outside of town. He was suddenly distracted by what he thought was the roar of an explosion. Seeing blue-orange flam es, he gave up the car chase for this greater em ergency and headed towards a dy nam ite shack he knew to be in the area. Driving was difficult on the steep gravel and dirt road. He approached the area where he’ d seen the flam es, reached the crest and slowly drove westward. A shiny object cam e into sight about 150-200 y ards off the   52 Stringfield, Leonard H., UFO Status Reports II and III, 1982. 53 Emenegger, Robert, UFO' s Past, Present & Future , Bal lentine, N ew York, 1974. 378"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":" road Zam ora initially thought he was looking at a car overturned into a gully . He saw two sm all hum anoid occupants, reportedl y dressed in white overalls. At about 4:45 pm , Sgt. Zam ora radioed to h eadquarters and reported a possible autom obile crash, stating his intent to be outside of his patrol car investigating. Zam ora stated that he drove up the road to a vantage point where he could see into the gully . Zam ora reported: As I approached the scene, I thought it was an overturned car--on end, sort of. As I finally got a look at it, it was a shiny -type object. The object was like alum inum --it was whitish against a m oss background, but no chrom e. Seem ed like a football shape like this. I saw two pair of overalls. 54 Zam ora went on to relate that one of the peopl e turned and noticed his car, seem ingly startled. Zam ora was approaching closer with the intent of offering help when quickly a loud roaring began. It started at a low frequency , rising to a high and very loud frequency , accom panied by a flam e. Sgt. Zam ora hurried back to his patrol car, hitting his leg on the fender and knocking off his glasses. The roaring object rose into the air and m oved away from him . Zam ora was quite frightened. He flung his arm across his face but turn ed to look at the object. \"I heard a whine, then total silence,\" Zam ora reported. He quick ly radioed back to police headquarters, alm ost hy sterical. A fellow officer, Sgt. Chavez, soon arrived at the scene. He stated: When I arrived, Zam ora was sweating and white...very pale. I went down to where the object had been. I noticed the brush was burning in several places. I could see the tracks on the ground. The object had left four perpendicular im pressions in the ground. I noticed sm oldering bushes, but they felt cold to the touch. I knew Lonnie had seen som ething--the proof was right there. Before I arrived, he had m ade a sketch of an insignia he saw on the side of the object. I secured the area and called the local m ilitary authorities. 55 Soon the area was swarm ing with spectators, reporters, an FBI agent and several others. Astrophy sicist Dr. J. Allen Hy nek flew in to inves tigate im mediately . He in fact returned for two more visits to the site and interviews with local residents and Zam ora, in whom he expressed belief. The FBI chief investigator on the case, Ca ptain Hector Quintanilla, stated that soil and vegetation sam ples were obtained and tested at Wr ight-Patterson, m easurem ents were taken and a thorough investigation was conducted. Yet th e case was lost in red tape and no official determ ination was ever m ade. Several secret m ilitary test vehicles were m entioned by the press as possible explanations, all of which rem ained inconclusive. Sgt. Zam ora was subjected to ridicule and finger-pointing which led him to leave the law enforcem ent profession and avoid discussion of the incident. The sheer num ber of reports from credible ci vilian, law enforcem ent and m ilitary witnesses from New Mexico cry for a serious scientific i nvestigation and a release of all evidence and material collected therein. 6.5 Military Aircraft Encounter - 1951 On February 9, 1951, United States Navy Flight 125 departed from Keflavik, Iceland en route to the Naval Air Station in Argentia, Newfoundl and. The co-pilot was U.S. Naval Reserve Lieutenant Graham E. Bethune, a Disclosure Project witness who served 26 years on active duty .   54 Ibid , p. 64. 55 Ibid , p. 65. 379"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":" Lt. Bethune, who was stationed in Mary land at the tim e, was one of three officers suggested to fly to Keflavik for a classified m eeting between Lockheed and the Icelandic governm ent. The Icelanders had asked for Am erican troops to protect them , stating they had been seeing unidentified craft off the coasts of Iceland. Lt. Bethune assum ed they were observing classified, experim ental craft. However, his opinion changed while on board Navy Flight 125. Just after m idnight, at 0055 on February 10, 1951, Lt. Bethune and his crew had an encounter with an unknown object. The following report is in Lt. Bethune’s own words: I was the pilot from Iceland to Newfoundland. 240 m iles out I saw som ething on the water 40 miles away . Moonset had occurred an hour previous. Nothing was scheduled to be in that area. I called it to attention of m y naviga tor and co-pilot. It looked like a city in the distance. There was a pattern to the lights on the water — an odd pattern. I thought it was a classified rescue m ission. 20 m iles out, the lights went out. A yellow halo appeared on the water. It flew towards us, som e 20 m iles, at approxim ately 1,000 miles per hour. It stopped 200 ft below us. I observed a faint dom e shape to it. I had a knowing that it was intelligently controlled — it cam e over to look at us. The object stay ed about five m iles away , at about a 45 Ν an angle. It flew with us, looking at us. I estim ated its size at 300 feet in diam eter. My plane had no guns. The on-board m agnetic co mpass did spin. We had 31 passengers on board, including a Navy com mander [and] a psy chiatrist. I went back and spoke to the psy chiatrist and asked him if he had observe d any thing unusual. The com mander said he saw what we saw. The psy chiatrist said, “Yes, it was a fly ing saucer and I didn’t look at it because such things don’ t exist.” I told m y crew not to report it. But it was picked up on Gander radar. We were interrogated in Iceland. It was obvious from the questions and dem eanor of the US Navy men who debriefed us that they ’d seen things out there before. A report on this event was kept at Wright-Patterson AFB. I found it in 1991, in the archives. I have the report, along with letters from NICAP, Key hoe’ s report to c ongress, and photos of the plane I was in. All five pilots described it the UFO the sam e — its size; the aura around it. A lieutenant who was on duty the night we were interrogated was told they tracked it by radar in excess of 1,800 m ph. No radar report was included in the 17-page report — it was m issing from the report when I finally found the report in 1991. Radar was confirm ed at the tim e. I estim ated the speed of the object at 1,000 m ph. The other pilots estim ated 1,000 - 1,500 mph. The fastest fighter we had at tim e could go 500 m ph. There were no jets at the tim e — in February 1951. This object was not a shooting star. It was alway s between the plane and the water. We had extensive recognition training then. We di dn’ t have the instrum entation assists that we have today . We navigated by stars. We had about a 54th of a second to identify som ething while we were fly ing in a m oving plane. We are the ones who gave the inform ation to the astrophy sicists since we were the ones up there. We had m any sightings but this is the one that we have docum entation for. 56 Upon landing in Argentia, Newfoundland, Lt. Be thune and his crew were interrogated by Naval officers about the incident. In Lt. Bethune’s official, confidential report filed at the Fleet Logistic Air Wing, Atlantic/Continental, Air Transport Squadron One, U.S. Naval Air Station, Patuxent River, Mary land, date d February 10, 1951, he gave a dditional details: The object was   56 Taped transcript from closed Disclosure Project witnesses' meeting, April 9, 1997, Washington, D.C. 380"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":" first seen when the aircraft was at least 250 m iles off the coast of Iceland. Bethune and the co- pilot kept the object under observance for four to five m inutes before calling it to the attention of the rest of the crew. When the object lifted and rushed towards them at an estim ated 1,000 m iles per hour, Lt. Bethune’s first feeling was that th e Navy plane would collide with the UFO in m id- air. When it approached the plan e, its shape was clearly discernable to be that of a disc, at least 300 feet in diam eter. Its color changed from yellow to reddish-orange. When it reversed course and flew away from the aircraft to va nish over the horizon, its speed tripled. 57 The other members of the Flight 125 crew subm itted written reports as well. Lt. Fred W. Kingdon, serving as second Plane Com mander, stated, \"I was an eye witness to an unusual sighting of an unidentified object.\" Lt. Kingdon was in the right-hand seat (co-pilot) while Lt. Bethune was in the left-hand seat. When the UFO rose from the surface of the water and sped towards the plane, Lt. Kingdon described it as \"v ery large and was circular with a glowing yellow-orange ring around its outer edge.\" Although the object was very close, it was difficult to determ ine its exact speed and configuration sin ce it was observed over water at night. \"However, the speed was trem endous and the size was at least 200 to 300 feet in diam eter. The object was close enough to m e to see and observe it clearly ,\" Kingdon reported 58 . Plane Com mander LTJG A. L. Jones was in the cabin of the plane when one of the navigators cam e aft and pointed to the object. He stated: I watched it for a m inute and went forward to th e cockpit to get a better view. Upon reaching the cockpit, I took the plane off of the aut opilot and turned to a true heading of 290 Ν in pursuit of the object. The object left on a heading of about 290 Ν true and went over the horizon in a very short tim e. I would guess the speed to be well over 1500 m iles per hour, and the diam eter to be at least 300 feet. My first view of it resem bled a huge fiery orange disc on its edge...When it went over the horizon, it seem ed to go from a vertical position to a horizontal position, with only the traili ng edge showing in a half-m oon effect. 59 The plane’ s navigator, Lt. Noel J. P. Koger, rem arked in his report: Lieutenant Kingdon pointed out an orange co lored object about 060° relative, or 290° true, say ing it appeared like a sm all village or a ship. Due to our position, I was certain it wasn’ t a village. I had been looking at the object about thirty seconds, which it appeared to me was another dem onstration of the ‘ northern lights’ phenom enon...when the object suddenly started getting m uch brighter, taking on shape and com ing in our direction at a great rate of speed... The best view I had of the object showed it to be a circular, bright orange-red disc, which was approaching us at a very great, undeterm inable speed. 60 The Air Intelligence Inform ation Report 61 prepared for this encounter sum marizes the observances of the crew m embers, stating that Lt. Bethune was the first to see the object. The report states that all five crew m embers were expe rienced North Atlantic fliers and that all five observers agreed on the facts as stated.   57 Commander Bet hune’s ori ginal Memorandum Report U.

One of the m ost frequent rhetorical questions posed about UFOs is: if they are real, why don’t they just land on the White House lawn? Actu ally , they cam e pretty close to doing just that on two consecutive weekends in July of 1952. The sum mer of 1952 was one of the m ost prolific for reported sightings of UFOs. There had been a significant num ber of reports flowing in all along the Eastern seaboard and from the Midwestern states for weeks. Intelligence officer s grew increasingly m ore uneasy over the sharp rise in sightings. Of special concern was th at m any of these statem ents were com ing from civilians. Prior to that fateful sum mer, m ost sightings had com e from m ilitary personnel and had been kept from the public. But now the citizen s them selves, including com mercial airline pilots had becom e sources of inform ation: July 10, 1962: A National Airlines plane over Quantico, Virginia observed a light at 2,000 feet which the crew stated was too slow to be a big m eteor and too fast to be a lighted balloon. July 12, 1952: Form er Air Force jet pilot Jack Green in Delphi, Indiana was one of m any who witnessed a blue-white saucer-shaped object high in the sky . July 13, 1952: Thousands of people in Indiana polis witness a huge oval speed over the city at 5,000 feet, frightening m any . An Eastern Air Lines captain, an Air Force pilot, and a private pilot all saw a controlled craft initially fly ing m uch higher which descended to about 5,000 feet and flew over the city of Indianapolis. This was the first low-range sighting witnessed by thousands of people, at least in the era of UFO sightings th at began in the 40s. Just prior to its appearance over Indiana, possibly the sam e object - certainly one bearing the sam e description - was seen on Air Force radar at Kirksville, Missouri. It was estim ated to be fly ing at 1,700 m ph and to be the size of a B-36 bom ber. July 13, 1962: A com mercial pilot and crew, fly ing at 11,000 feet sixty miles southwest of Washington, spotted a light below them . The li ght rose to the sam e altitude as the plane, hovered to the left of the plane for several m inutes, then rose rapidly when the p ilot turned on the plane’ s landing lights. July 14, 1952: A PanAm flight headed south to Miam i from New York reported observing glowing orange UFOs near Newport News, Virginia. ( Note: The first form ation consisted of six discs were seen; two m ore were seen soon after the first form ation flew off.) As the form ation approached the plane, the lead disc turned on its edge. The others instantly did the sam e. All the discs flipped to horizontal, changed direction and sped off. July 17, 1952: An Am erican Airlines flight near Denver received a radio transm ission warning of a craft ahead. Captain Paul Carpenter and crew observed four saucers in form ation fly ing at an estim ated 3,000 m ph. From the ground: July 16, 1952: Langley Air Force Base was the scene for a sighting of two large am ber lights. One of the two observers was a well-r espected civilian scientist from Langley . The lights 382"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":" made a 180 Ν degree turn, returned to where they were first spotted, jockey ed with each other, were joined by a third light, started clim bing a nd when doing so, were joined by several other lights - all fly ing in form ation. It is estim ated that the entire even t lasted three m inutes. UFOs Buz z the White House: At 11:40 pm on July 19, 1952, dual radar stations at Washington National Airport picked up seven objects east and south of Andrews Air Force Base. Andrews also picked up the targets on their radar. Conventional aircraft were quickly ruled out as the cause; these targets would fly at 100-130 mph, suddenly accelerate to extrem ely high speeds and leave the area. One object was clocked at 7,200 m iles per hour. Reportedly , the objects appeared in every sector of the radarsc opes, including fly ing through restricted air space over the White House and Capitol building. The objects returned several tim es throughout the night and were also seen by airline pilots (at midnight and 2:00 a.m .), air traffic control tower operators, and jet fighter pilots w ho were dispatched from Andrews. Edward Ruppelt wrote: But the clincher cam e in the wee hours of the morning, when an ARTC traffic controller called the control tower at Andrews AFB and told the tower operators that ARTC had a target just south of their tower, directly over the A ndrews Radio range station. The tower operators looked and there was a ‘huge fiery -orange sphere’ hovering in the sky directly over their range station. 62 Apparently , Air Force Intelligence was not info rm ed about the events until they , along with every one else in the area, read the newspape r headlines the next m orning: INTERCEPTORS CHASE FLYING SAUCERS OVER WASHINGTON, D.C. Even a m ajor at the Pentagon stated to Project Blue Book investigator Edward Ruppe lt that all he knew about the events was what he’d read in the newspaper. A full investiga tion ensued im mediately under the supervision of said major — Dewey Fournet. The air traffic c ontrollers at Washington National told intelligence officers that the targets they observed were caused by radar waves bouncing off a hard, solid object — these were not tem perature inversions. The radar operator Air Forcem an at Andrews and the two veteran airline pilots concurred. Second Washington Flap: Serendipitously , the second wave of sightings over Washington occurred seven day s later, nearly to the hour. Those seven intervening day s had been far from quiet; UFO reports were flowing into Wright Field in Day ton, Ohio at the rate of thirty to forty per day — triple the previous num bers. Edward Ruppelt claim s that \"m any were as good, if not better, than the Washington incident.\" The most outstandingly unexplained of those reports included am ber-red lights observed over the Gu ided Missile Long-Range Proving Ground at Patrick Air Force Base, Florida; a rapidly m oving large, round, silver spinning object in Uvalde, Texas; and m ilitary jets unsuccessfully chasing UFOs over Los Alam os, New Mexico; Massachusetts (two events), and New Jersey . A stunning prelude was the forerunner to the second wave over Washington. In the early evening of July 26, a saucer-shaped vehicle flashing red light winked in over the Naval Air Station in Key West, Florida, reportedly seen by hundreds. The events then speed up the Eastern Seaboard, focusing again on the nation’s capitol. There, beginning around 9:00 p.m ., Washington area radar operators were once more picking up ‘bogies’ sim ilar to the previous weekend’s mayhem . Within an hour, four or five UFOs at once were a continuous presence on the radar   62 The Report on Unidentified Flying Saucers, Ruppelt, Ed ward J., Doubleday & Company, New York, 1956. 383"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":" screens. Military jets were dispatched and co mmercial airlines were rerouted. According to Ruppelt, the press who had gathered at the contro l tower at Washington National were asked to leave. He wrote: When I later found out that the press had been dism issed on the grounds that the procedures used in an intercept were classified , I knew that this was absurd because any ham radio operator worth his salt could build equipm ent and listen in on any intercept. The real reason for the press dism issal, I learned, was not that a few people in the radar room were positive that this night would be the big night in UFO history --the night when a pilot would close in on and get a good look at a UFO--and they didn’ t want the press to be in on it. 63 However, the extraterrestrial UFO pilots ha d other ideas. As soon as the F-94 jets were airborne, around m idnight, the UFOs all vanished fro m the radar scopes. The pilots could m ake no visual contact despite good visibility and weather. However, it was later learned that Langley AFB and civilians in the area had visuals on colore d, rotating lights in the sky . But — surprise! — as soon as the military jets left the area, the UFOs popped back up on the Washington radar screens once m ore. One F-94 pilot who did see a light and was vectored to it by air traffic control reported that it went out as soon as he got near, \"like som ebody turning off a lightbulb.\" Brief radar lock-ons were obtained by the pilot. 64 The UFOs continued to play gam es with the F-94s, stay ing put while they approached, then speeding away or vanishing. The UFOs play ed \"catch m e if y ou can\" until the jets had nearly depleted their fuel, which coincided with the a pproaching sunrise. Once it got light, the UFOs had gone for good. Once m ore, the radar operators confirm ed that they believed the targets were caused by solid, m etallic, m oving objects and were not due to any weather aberrations. And, once more, newspaper headlines were devoted to the UF Os. In the Pentagon, it was m ass confusion, bolstered by the fact that new UFO reports were fl owing in which verified visual sightings in the sam e areas where the radar targets had been locat ed. This did little to support the Pentagon’ s working hy pothesis that freakish weather conditions had caused the radar bogies. And, prior to the Washington flap, very few reports indicated both radar and visual lock-on. By now, there was trem endous pressure to tell the public something . Rather lam e excuses by the military did nothing to stem the tide of outcry flowing into the Pentagon, additionally fueled by m ore significant sighting reports com ing in fro m coast to coast and by the creeping suspicion that the Russians were perhaps i nvolved. According to researcher Donald Key hoe, Director of Air Force Intelligence, Major General John A. Sam ford grappled with several false explanations which the Pentagon hoped would dowse the escalati ng agitation of John and Jane Q. Public. Calm ly and glibly explaining the saucers away as various quirky natural phenom ena, while adm itting that \"twenty percent\" of the cases rem ained unsolved, the General went on to state that no pattern had rem otely been revealed that indicat ed any threat or m enace to the United States. The spin to debunk the existence of extraterr estrial spacecraft and visitors was printed by newspapers all over the country . According to Donald Key hoe, just as the presses were rolling out this y arn, the Air Force had jets chasing sau cers over the Midwestern states. Key hoe stated, \"[O] ne case, if it had been m ade public that night , would have ruined the inversion answer and wrecked the debunking plan.

A Disclosure Project witness supplied the following report: I am 49 years old, a college graduate, a disabled vet, and served in the United States Air Force from 1964 to 1974. In 1967, I had two dir ect observations of foreign technology and heard of at least two related incidents. The first direct observation of ETV (\"extraterrestrial vehicle\") occurred Novem ber 1967 en route to a Minutem an I site for repairs at 2200 hours in North Dakota (Minot AFB). There were three staff in our vehicle, two Ballistic Missile Analy sts, m yself and m y assistant, an arm ed security policem an. The guard m ade a com ment to the effect that it was \"awfully quiet out here.\" I decided to check the four channe ls on our radio when we heard, \"I am going to shoot at it, sir. It’s about 300 feet above the site!\" We im mediately went into a duress condition, which calls for all personnel to respond to the assistance of the crew under duress. The entire episode took maybe 2-3 minutes. We were able to hear the Launch Control Com bat Crew Com mander ordering the two security guards at a nearby site to NOT shoot at the ETV. We headed in the direction of the site and observed a large, bright object with blinking red/green/blue lights at about 10-12 m iles. The object began to rise as radio transm issions were fly ing back and forth. It rose and accelerated straight up at extrem ely high speed and disappeared as F-102’s and/or F-106 interceptors flew overhead. The two security guards were guarding the s ite (sites are unm anned) due to security system s failure and were awaiting a m aintenance team to repair. This could take up to 3-4 day s depending if it was a weekend. At the height of the incident, up to six other security police were at or near the site in three vehicl es (strike team s) in response to the duress codes. One of the guards (the one that was going to shoot at the ETV) went on a m aintenance trip later that week with m y crew and after prodding from m e for 30-40 m inutes gave m e details of their ordeal and their debriefing. The two guards were debriefed by Dr. J. Allen Hy nek and other staff not from Minot AFB. Dr. Hy nek m ade the com ment \"this craft has been observed before.\" According to the guard , he and his team m ember were ordered by a USAF colonel to not discuss what had happened or they would be sent to Viet Nam im mediately . They were both scared to death. The second incident occurred several weeks la ter when, while light snow was falling and a low ceiling was observed by m e shortly before nightfall, a guard m ade a com ment about the \"strange m oon\" in the sky . Directly overhead of where we were repair ing a Minutem an site was a m oon-sized object, sam e color as the m oon BELOW the cloud cover.

Extracts from a NORAD Com mand Director’ s Log 69 from the fall of 1975 (see attached) chronicles a long list of sightings at a num ber of other SAC and Air Force bases: 29 Oct 75 - An “unknown helicopter” landed in the m unitions storage area at Loring Air Force Base in Maine two nights in a row. There is mention of an unconfirm ed report of Canadian air bases being overflown by a “helicopter.” Loring AFB turned in another report of a ‘probable helicopter overflight’ on Novem ber 1 as well. 31 Oct 75 - Wurtsm ith Air Force Base (Michiga n) reported a “helicopter” hovering over a SAC weapons storage area. A tanker plane had visual lock-on and radar “skin paint” and was able to track the object over Lake Huron. 8 Nov 75 - This entry details the first of the “unknowns” fly ing above Malstrom AFB and vicinity in Montana, stating that pilots had visual a nd radar lock-ons. The UFOs eluded the fighter jets by turning off their lights when the jets were bearing towards them , then turning them back on when the F-106’s left. 10 Nov 75 - A bright, silent object the size of an autom obile buzzed Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota. 12 - 25 Nov 75 - Civilians call in reports fro m Minnesota, Virginia, Ontario and Mendicino County , California of m any diverse ty pes of UFOs, including cigar-shaped craft, diam ond- shaped objects, cup in a bowl-shaped, rotating light s, balls of light, ovals with blinking lights, and fireballs. By the mid 1980’s (date estim ated) the Directory of Databases described the NORAD Unknown Tracking Sy stem 70 , classified Secret, as containing 7,000 incidents of unknown traffic over or near North Am erica since the database was started in 1971.

Maryland The National Military Com mand Center issued another report 72 , dated 30 July 1976, detailing several reports of UFOs around Fort Ritchie, Mary land in the wee hours of July 30th. After civilians called in sightings reports, two separat e m ilitary police patrols described observing three reddish, oblong cy linders hovering very low (100-200 feet) over an am munitions storage site. Independently , an Arm y police sergeant reported seeing a UFO over the sam e site while he was driving to work approxim ately 50 m inutes after the report by the two patrols. Interestingly , the final paragraph of this report attem pted to explain away the sightings as m oisture-saturated tem perature inversions. Taken as a whole, the m yriad of reports deta iled here m ake an irrefutable case for United States m ilitary involvem ent in reporting UFOs. It is apparent from these reports, which are certainly not all-inclusive, that the U.S. m ilitary di d indeed have an interest in UFOs and certainly investigated sightings well after the conclusion of Project Blue Book in 1969, which supposedly closed the door on the m ilitary ’s interest in the s ubject of extraterrestrials and their space craft. 6.8 Military Chase Over Iran - 1976 The distinction for the best governm ent doc um entation of a UFO event falls to the rem arkable events that occurred in and above Te hran, Iran in Septem ber of 1976. The official U.S. governm ent docum ents 73 following this narrative were distributed at the tim e of its writing by the Defense Attaché at the United States Em bassy in Tehran to the Defense Intelligence Agency , the White House, the CIA, the National Security Agency , the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Secretary of the Air Force, the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of State. 74 At half-past m idnight on Septem ber 19, 1976, the Im perial Iranian Air Force received telephone calls from residents in the Shem iran ar ea of Tehran. The citizens reported \"strange objects in the sky ,\" som e calling them bird-like and others referring to them as lighted helicopters. The com mand post knew there were no airborne helicopters at the tim e and told the citizens they were seeing stars in the sky . Th e com mand post checked with Mem rabad Tower. Then, looking for him self, observed a large, bright star-like object. At 1:30 a.m ., an F-4 jet was scram bled from Shahrokhi Air Force Base and sent up to investigate. F-4s are Scrambled: The pilot reported that the object was so bright, it was easily visible from 70 m iles away , which would place it approxim ately 40 m iles north of Tehran. The IIAF pilot pursued the unusual craft. At 25 nautical m iles from the unknown object, the pilot suddenly lost all UHF and intercom com munications and in strum entation. When the pilot turned back towards Shahrokhi AFB, away from the UFO, he just as suddenly regained com munication   72 See ori ginal report in Appendi x I.

Due to the strangeness of the unfol ding events, a second F-4 was dispatched. The backseat pilot obtained radar lock-on with the UFO at 27 nautical m iles distance. When the F-4 got within 25 m iles of the object, the UFO incr eased its speed and m oved away , pacing itself to maintain a sustained 25-m ile distance from the jet. Colored Lights Observed on the UFO: The official governm ent reports follow this narrative. Written by Col. Frank B. McKenzie, United States Air Force, it states that the F-4 pilots com pared the size of the object on radar to a 707 tanker, stating that a visual size estim ate was difficult to the extrem e brilliance of the UFO. However, the pilots were able to describe flashing, rectangular strobe lights in blue, green , red and orange. The sequence of the strobing lights was so rapid that all four colors could be seen at once, according to the report. Objects Within Objects: The incident grew even m ore strange as it continued. As the F-4 pursued the UFO south of Tehran, a second object ejected from the prim ary target. It was brilliantly lit and was estim ated to be one-half to one-third the size of the m oon. The second object zoom ed towards the F-4. At this point, the F-4 pilot attem pted to fire an AIM-9 m issile at the UFO. Instantly , his weapons control panel lost all power, and com munication capabilities were down once m ore. The pilot made an extrem e evasive negative G dive to escape the UFO. As he did so, the UFO trailed the F-4 at an estim ated distance of three to four nautical m iles. As the pilot turned the jet, the secondary object appeared on the inside of his turn. It then returned to the prim ary UFO, rejoining perfectly with it. Alm ost im mediately thereafter, another object ejected out the opposite side of the prim ary UFO. It fell towards the ground at a trem endous rate of speed. By now, the F-4’s com munications a nd weapons sy stem s were once again functioning norm ally . The UFO Lands: The F-4 crew watched the nose-diving UFO in anticipation of seeing a huge crash and explosion. Much to their astonishm ent, the UFO appeared to com e to rest gently on the ground with no im pact whatsoever. Moreover, it cast an extrem ely bright light extending over a two to three kilom eter range (well over one m ile). More Radio Interference: The Iranian F-4 began to descend, while the crew continued to observe the landed UFO and m ark its location. It took several atte mpts before they could land the fighter jet. Each tim e they passed through a certain m agnetic bearing, the aircraft lost com munications and the on-board instrum entation fl uctuated dram atically . Moreover, a civilian aircraft in the vicinity also reported com municati on failure but reported no visual contact with the UFO. During the F-4’s final approach into Sh ahrokhi, the IIAF crew observed another object - this one cylindrical with bright steady lights on either end and a flashing light in the center. The control tower reported no other known air traffic in the area. The tower was able to get a visual lock-on when the pilots told them in which area to look as the cy linder-like UFO passed over the F-4. Follow-up Investigation: The following day , the F-4 crew was taken by helicopter to the area where they had tracked the landed UFO. The spot turned out to be a dry lakebed. Instrum entation aboard the helicopter regist ered a strong beeping signal over and around the lakebed. The strongest signal cam e from the area of a sm all house. The helicopter landed and the residents were questioned by m ilita ry personnel about events of the previous night. The fam ily members said they heard a loud noise and saw a very bright light, sim ilar to lightning. Further investigation was apparently done to determ ine possible radiation residue. We have found no docum entation of the results of the radiation tes ting and other post-event investigation, although it should be noted that this event was confirm ed by satellite. The satellite tracking num bers can be obtained from Mr. Tony Craddock of the Disclosure Project. 390"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":" 6.9 RAF/USAF Bentw aters - Woodbridge - December 1980 One of the m ost im portant close encounters ev er reported by the m ilitary , with docum entation obtained through the Freedom of Inform ation Act, is the m ultiple-witness events which occurred at a joint British/Am erican NATO air base in Engl and. The release to Am erican researchers of the memorandum detailing the eye witness account of Lt. Col. Charles E. Halt (later prom oted to Colonel), deputy com mander of the base, gave trem endous credence to the investigative reports done at the tim e of the incident. It is im portant to note this Halt m emorandum states that the initial event occurred “Early on the m orning of 27 Dec 80 (approxim ately 0300L).” 75 In Septem ber, 1994, one of the security m en present at the encounter, Staff Sargent Jam es Penniston underwent voluntary hy pnosis about the event. He stated that though during hy pnosis by governm ent agents a few day s after the event he was told that the stories from the witnesses would be the sam e, but would have different dates. 76 This m ay explain why the dates in different reports are confusing. It is generally accepted that the initial event occurred early in the m orning hours of Decem ber 26, 1980. RAF/USAF Woodbridge is located eight miles east of Ipswich, Suffolk in England, and is one-half of the twin bases whose other half is the RAF Bentwaters NATO Air Base. All of the main buildings and quarters were at Bentwa ters, although Woodbridge had its own runway . During World War II, the twin bases served as a m aintenance unit for front line forces in Germ any . Hercules transports and huge helicopters were based here. It was entirely a US base, manned alm ost exclusively with US personnel, with only a token Brit in residence who was given the rank of squadron leader. 77 The large and dense Rendlesham Forest surrounds the bases. The Close Encounters Over two nights on the Christm as holiday weekend in 1980, astonishing close encounters occurred on the twin air bases of Bentwaters a nd Woodbridge. Preceded by a visit outside the forest to a nearby residence, a UFO landed in the forest on the Bentwaters Air Force Base around 2:30 am on Decem ber 26, 1980. It was witnessed firs t by two soldiers on patrol. The m en first thought they were seeing a beam from a lighthouse and then guessed it could be \"light-alls\" — large, portable bright lights which effectively turned night to day to provide visibility for nighttim e m aneuvers. As they watched, the hovering light descended below treetop level. The soldiers thought perhaps a plane had just crashed on the Bentwaters runway . The m en radioed to headquarters. Three relief guards were sent out, and this first pair m issed the rest of the encounter. Two of the relief guards went by jeep a nd then by foot through the forest in pursuit of the UFO. The m en described it as som ewhat tr iangular in shape and possessed blue, white and red lights around the perim eter of the bright white body of the craft. When the soldiers cam e within sight of the UFO, it was hovering just above the ground, or resting on landing gear on the ground. It lifted up and drifted slowly when one of the soldiers got very near, then shot straight up at a dizzy ing speed while casting a bright light onto the forest, causing cattle to panic. The two soldiers were dazed by the event. A sear ch party found them alm ost an hour later, still disoriented. British police were called in; airpor t radar controllers were contacted. Heathrow reported a target on radar that disappeared in the Bentwaters vicinity , and reports of bright lights in the sky had com e in at various tim es from all around southern England. It was confirm ed that   75 Official Department of the Air Force memorandum by Lt. Col. Charles I. Halt, 13 January 1981. Appendix I.

Additional encounters ensued the following ni ght. Several m ilitary personnel saw UFOs perform m aneuvers that no known hum an-engineer ed devices could carry out, including changing shape and size. Near midnight on the 26th, a four-m an team set out to investigate the area in Rendlesham Forest where the UFO had com e to rest the night before. Soon they observed a highly unusual curtain of light with m ist or fog below it. As the soldiers got closer, they could see a structured object, described to be of indeterm inate shape but with yellow, red and blue lights on it. The multi-colored object backed away while a high level of static electricity saturated the atm osphere, causing hair to stand on end. The soldiers ra dioed to Lt. Col. Halt, the deputy com mander at Bentwaters, who told them to stay put, that he would bring reinforcem ents and join them . Lt. Col. Halt and approxim ately thirty soldiers arrived who began to erect light-alls, which initially failed to function. Halt dictated notes into a portable tape recorder, registering radiation readings that increased in the area where the UFO had landed the previous night and left three im prints in a triangular shape in the soil, and detectable heat signatures on the surrounding trees, which were visible through a starlight scope. Shortly before 2:00 a.m ., Col. Halt and the soldiers saw a single y ellow-red light on the ground, which caused the anim als on the adjacent fa rm to becom e agitated. Suddenly , the lighted object rose and glided in the air towa rds them , issuing from itself a stream of m ulti- colored lights. Other military men saw the light m erge into the foggy essence on the ground and im plode within it. There was a trem endous flash of light and the fog transform ed into a solid, dom ed disc with a fluorescent glow to it, rim med with blue light. The area of blue light on the craft showered out sparkling colored bits that fell onto the ground. Allegedly , two separate military m en took photographs of this object. The craft lifted and began to produce m ore spectacular light display s around its rim . It hovered and bobbled in the air in front of the soldiers. As the UFO m oved away , up to five separate lighted objects were observed. The m en watched the objects m ove out over Woodbridge and towards the sea where they put on a lengthy display , som etim es appearing as half-m oons and som etim es as full circles, alway s sparkling with colored light. However, the enc ounter was to becom e close once m ore. One of the UFOs raced above the forest toward them , sending down beam s of light. Two soldiers on a separate detail reported an am orphous structure of light weaving through the trees that sent light beam s straight through tree trunks then seem ed to explode above them like a dy ing star. The night’s incredible events had spanned m ore than four hours. 78 Civilian Witnesses The first ey ewitness was a resident on the other side of Rendlesham Forest in Sudbourne nam ed Gordon Levett. Levett was outside prepar ing to put his dog away for the night. A huge mushroom -shaped bright object drifted in from the sea and hovered silently in the sky above Levett and his large guard dog, who began trem bling and rem ained shaken by the event throughout the following day . During an interv iew with British UFO researcher Jenny Randles, Levett recalled:   78 Deta ils in this n arra tive ta ken fro m Ou t of the Blu e by Jenny Randl es, and N BC-TV t elevi sion program Unsolved Mysteries , first air dat e, Sept ember 18, 1991. 392"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":" My attention was drawn to the sky by som e unknown m eans.

Art hur Sm ekle saw a m ass of lights in the sky above Rendlesham Forest about 11:00 pm while driving hom e through the forest. He m entioned it when he got hom e but was rem inded that it since he was adjacent to the air base, it was probably just an aircraft. The Webb fam ily all saw a huge white m ass of lights in the sky at 2:30 am (now 27 Decem ber) while driving hom e to Martlesham . They stopped the car by the side of the road and watched it hover silently , then shoot off through the sky at extrem e speed. Several farm ers in the area also were interviewed or subm itted reports to the British investigators. One of the farm ers had even called into the base and reported bright lights in the sky just before the UFO cam e into the Bentwaters com pound. Forest Ranger Jam es Brownlea found phy sical traces of the landing in the forest the following m onth. While the official governm ent m emo by Col. Halt was not released for another two and one-half y ears, Brownlea’ s January 1981 report describing finding a hole in the tree canopy , scorched trees and unusual m arks on the ground coincide with what Lt. Halt officially reported to the British Ministry of Defense and the United States Air Force. 80 Col. Halt’s report details the events of the second night’s encounters as follows: Later in the night a red sun-like light was seen through the trees. It m oved about and pulsed. At one point it appeared to throw off glowing particles and then break into five separate white objects and then disappeared. Im mediately thereafter, three star-like objects were noticed in the sky , two objects to the north and one to the south, all of which were about 10º off the horizon. The objects m oved rapidly in sharp angular m ovem ents and display ed red, green and blue lights. The objects to the north appeared to be elliptical through an 8-12 power lens. They then turned to full circles. The objects in the north rem ained in the sky for an hour or m ore.

The two-person crew consisted of a flight officer and a flight engineer. Captain Terauchi was a 29- year veteran pilot in 1986. Flight 1628 was en route to Toky o via Reky javik, Iceland and Anchorage, Alaska. At approxim ately 6:00 pm in the evening, the aircraft was passing over the Canadian/Alaskan border and the crew was making preparations to land at Anchorage. At 6:19 pm Alaska Standard Tim e, Capt. Terauchi radioed a traffic inform ation request to the Anchorage Air Route Traffic Control Center. Air Traffic Control Specialist Carl Henley checked his radar and told the captain there was no traffic in his vicinity . Capt. Terauchi responded that lighted traffic was in close proxim ity at 12 o’clock at the sam e altitude as Flight 1628, following or shadowing his aircraft. Terauchi declined a re quest by Specialist Henley to check higher and lower altitude traffic, stating later that the object was level with the plane. Henley checked with Elm endorf Air Force Base radar and learned they had a prim ary target in the sam e position Terauchi reported. During som e of the frequent radio exchanges between Henley and Flight 1628, Henley did find prim ary returns in the sam e areas JL1628 reported traffic. Terauchi requested and obtained perm ission to m ake turns a nd deviations. The captain reported to Henley that the object stay ed right with the 747. At one point, Terauchi asked for and obtaine d perm ission to m ake a 360° turn to the right to fly parallel to the object, at which tim e it was not visi ble. When Terauchi returned to his original course, the object was there, as if it had been waiting for them , the Captain later said in his statem ent for the FAA. Specialist Henley also vectored a United Airlines aircraft and a m ilitary C-130 within range to have a look. Each pilo t reported no contact, alt hough Terauchi had also lost visual sight of the UFO by then. During the course of the event, Henley obser ved three types of tentative radar targets. When Henley asked Terauchi to describe the object, he stated that he could not identify any m arkings nor state what kind of aircraft it m ight be. Under clear, cloudless conditions, Terauchi stated that he saw white and y ellow strobing lights on the unide ntified craft. The 747’s on-board color radar was em ploy ed throughout the course of the sighti ng to determ ine the distance from the plane to the object as five to seven nautical m iles. Capt. Terauchi and his crew we re interviewed and debriefed by Jack Wright 83 of the FAA upon landing at Anchorage. During the debriefing, Ca pt. Terauchi stated that this was the first tim e any thing like this had happened to him . Explai ning the incident, Terauchi said that just after passing the Canadian/Alaskan border, fly ing at 35, 000 feet, an object, at tim es larger than the B- 747, with four or five lights in a line, appeared approxim ately five to seven nautical m iles in front of the aircraft. At tim es, m ore than one UFO w as visible. The sighting lasted nearly an hour--55 minutes per the FAA report. Although the Captain and his crew were a bit shaken, the FAA determ ined them to be professional and rational. According to Tim othy Good’ s account in his book Above Top Secret , Captain Terauchi reported that he was unable to explain the even t in conventional term s and said that the objects may have been extraterrestrial in origin since they m oved and stopped so quickly . The Captain rem arked that they were carry ing French wine to Japan, stating \"m aybe they wanted to drink it.\" 84   83 Incident and interview report by Jack Wright (FAA) in Appendix I.

We began to learn of these objects during the m assive Belgium wave beginning in 1990. The Disclosure Project activated its first investigative team to do real-tim e research in March of 1992. 87 Over 2,000 sightings were registered in Belgium , m any of them by law enforcem ent and m ilitary personnel 88 . Indeed, the triangle had been tracked on both civilian and m ilitary radar through m aneuve rs and exhibiting speeds far in excess of that which any conventional or experim ental aircraft could be capable 89 . In 1992, UFO activity increased dram atically in Scotland. Settled in the towns and valley s between Edinburgh and Glasgow, reports started com ing in with regularity . One particular town, Bonny bridge, seem ed to be the focal point of the flap. A close-knit com munity of about 5,500 people, y oung and old alike have reported num erous sightings of various craft, including the triangles. Bonny bridge Councilor Bill Buchanan stated in August of 1996, \"To my knowledge, 3,000 people have seen som ething unusual in our skies during the past few years...And there may be m any m ore who have been afraid to com e forward. 90 In the early years of the wave, m ost si ghtings involved balls of light, often spinning and maneuvering am ong them selves, or black discs. In the m id-1990’ s, sightings of triangular craft were often reported. Sky search Scotland, an investigative group led by the Malcolm fam ily in Falkirk, began am assing not only reports but videotape footage of what appeared to be lights in triangular form ation, balls of light, and black triangular-shaped hovering craft. Witnesses reported seeing these objects dive into the sea or em erge from it. Several Bonny bridge area residents recounted Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind, or hum an-interactive experiences. A young gentlem an from Arm adale told of a 35-40 foot bar-shaped object that cam e rapidly down from the sky during a lightning storm . It flew low over the hedgerows and passed directly over the m an’s car, then cam e to a halt in a field. The witness reported, \"it just sat there, hovering silently , about 15 feet off the ground. I got out of the car and pointed m y halogen lam p at it to get a better look. Im mediately , the bulb blew. Then m y headlights went out. I tried the car ignition, but it wouldn’t start. Suddenly , the thing leapt up and reversed at incredible speed over the top of the car.\" 91 The witness called the police on his cell phone , but it was an hour later than when the sighting occurred. The gentlem an cannot account for the m issing hour. After his vehicle was towed back to town, the electrical sy stem functioned perfectly once m ore.   85 Personnel Statement s - Federal Avi ation Admi nistrat ion by C . Henl ey i n Appendi x I.

Most reports cam e from the Midlands and to the north. However, several reports were received from the southwest of England. Each incident had rem arkable sim ilarities. Ey e witnesses reported the triangular craft to be dark or black, blending in with the night sky . The craft often had a light at each apex of the triangle, and a different ty pe of light in the center. The huge objects flew at a low altitude and a low speed. They were either totally silent or em itted a slight hum ming noise. In the sum mer of 1996, a fam ily was com ing hom e to Glastonbury in southwestern England about dusk on a Sunday evening. Suddenly , the driv er - the father - noticed a dark, silent shape pacing the car. The entire fam ily observed a huge triangular craft at low altitude above them . After observing it for a bit, the object was seen to sim ply vanish. 92 In October and Novem ber of 1996, significant waves of sightings of black triangles occurred in the United Kingdom , including a hot spot in the Cardigan Bay area of West Wales where num erous sightings were reported within these two m onths. Two articles in The Sunday Times (London) in August of 1996 report that the triangular craft has been identified as an experim ental craft unve iled by the U.S. Air Force and NASA in August 1996. The articles speculate that because of a near collision with a 747 com mercial jet in 1995, the governm ent had com e clean. Rum ors have surfaced since 1995 of an experim ental triangular craft sighted in California and Nevada which was called \"The Fly ing Dorito\", no doubt not its official nam e. According to The Sunday Times , the \"wave-rider\" craft was proposed in the 1950s by British scientist Terrence Nonweiler. Th e account goes on to give specifications of the craft -- capable of speeds in excess of 3,000 mph; ‘surfs’ on the air; low speed flight and ability to float or hover near ground level (term ed \"LoFly te\") . The article further cites avionics experts who claim the triangle cannot be traced by radar and that a com puter ‘flies’ the craft because hum an pilots are unable to perform all of its com plex m aneuvers. 93 The mystery of the gigantic triangular craft is fa r from solved. Sightings continue to be reported around the world to the present day . Many hundreds of these recent triangular craft sightings can be found on the Web site for the Na tional UFO Reporting Center found at www.m satech.com /nuforc/index.htm l. 6.12 The Mexico Wave - From 1991 The solar eclipse in 1991 was total in Mexico City . Many people were outdoors observing and videotaping. Much to their surprise, what they captured on tape in addition to the eclipse began an unprecedented wave of UFO sightings that has continued unabated from 1991 to the tim e of this writing in 1997. On the day of the eclipse, seventeen people in four cities videoed what appears to be the sam e object: a silver disk whose chunky shape earned it the m oniker of the \"hockey puck.\" One tape was shot by a television network executive, anothe r by a priest; indeed, by people from all walks of life in cities spread out across the vast Mexi can landscape. The tapes began arriving in the mail of Jaim e Maussan, the host of \"60 Minutos\", the Mexican version of our \"60 Minutes\" in the USA. Sr. Maussan launched a thorough, in-depth investigation of the phenom enon. He had as guests on his show m any of the people who had ta ken the videotapes.

Th e results revealed that the sam e ty pe of UFO, or “ovni” as it is called in Mexico, was captured by all the tapes, a nd each one appeared to disturb the air behind it. These features were noted in each one of the vi deotapes taken on that July day . Further investigation ruled out stars, planets or balloons as possible explanations. As tim e went on, tapes continued to be taken and sent to investigators, including Sr. Maussan. Many ovnis were film ed near jets taking off or landing at the Mexico City airport. There was often a visual lock-on with the ovni by pilots or air traffic controllers; how ever, the objects did not appear on radar. There were several reports from pilots of instrum ents suddenly m alfunctioning m omentarily when the ovni was nearby . There was concern about safety for the aircraft. Thankfully , none experienced any danger at all. An interesting correlation to the Mexico wave of 1991 cam e from 4,000 miles away on the sam e date. What appears to be the identical object was videotaped from Mt. Unsen, Japan. Indeed, when the videos from the four cities in Mexico are split-screened with the object shot in Japan, it is im possible to discern any differences. Those who would claim the entire Mexican wave on the solar eclipse is an elaborate hoax w ould be hard pressed to explain an identical, sim ultaneous sighting on the other side of the gl obe. Moreover, Sr. Maussan has received over 3,000 videos since 1991 of the ‘hockey puc k’ UFO as well as huge triangular craft. 6.13 The Incident in Varginha – Extraterrestrial Life Forms captured in Braz il? Facts supplied by Vitorio Pacaccini, Belo Horizonte, Brazil On January 20, 1996, m ilitary forces captured two apparent extraterrestrial creatures - still alive - in Brazil. The captures occurred in neighboring ar eas of the city of Varginha, located in the state of Minas Gerais in central Brazil. The event is to be considered one of the m ost significant ever registered in Brazil, and perhaps in the entire world. Military authorities are keeping secret the details of the operation, but inform ation has leaked to the UFO com munity due to the investigative work of Professor Vitorio Pacaccini and Ubirajar a Rodrigues. Both m en live nearby and are considered serious and dedicated researchers. Th ey have devoted over 3,000 hours of investigation to this case. On the afternoon of January 20, about 3:30 pm local tim e, three y oung girls nam ed Liliana, Falquira and Katia were walking outside of town . They cam e upon a strange, sm all creature in an area of sm all bushes at the edge of a field only a few blocks from where they live. It was a Saturday and the girls were returning hom e from thei r jobs. Crossing an em pty area, their attention was attracted by a very weird creature just a few m eters away . The ET was kneeling and looked as if it were hurt and suffering pain. No UFO was seen at that tim e. The girls observed the creature for a few m inutes then ran away , afraid that what they had just encountered m ight be the devil. The three girls were extensively interr ogated by the above-m entioned researchers, leaving no doubt whatsoever about what had happened. Very sim ple kids, they described the creature as being of a dark color with a sm all body of four to five f eet in height. It had no hair at all, had a large brown head and sm all neck. The face was descr ibed as possessing two eyes - large and red - with no pupils visible. There was a slit in place of a m outh, a very sm all nose and, interestingly , three protuberances right on the top of its forehead. Th e girls described the protuberances as horns, thus causing them to fear they had just encountered a devil. Following the leads, researchers Pacaccini and Rodrigues started m aking inquiries every where around the town of Varginha to see if any body else had seen the sam e creature. They found several people who observed the m ilitary operations as well as the creature in the sam e location and, 397"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":" perhaps, other creatures in different locations . While conducting the investigation, both m en discovered that different witnesses had seen arm y trucks and other m ilitary vehicles and personnel that very m orning, just a few blocks from where the girls had their encounter. While try ing to find out what the m ilitary were doing, Pacaccini and Rodrigues cam e to m eet a few soldiers and sergeants. One of the soldiers decided to talk secretly about the m ilitary m ission and gave a confidential taped interview. The military m an confirm ed that at about 9:00 am on January 20, the Fire Departm ent of Varginha was called by the m ilitary to capture a strange ‘anim al’ in the Jardim Andere district. Am ong the firem en who responded were Sergeant Palhares, Soldier Nivaldo, Corporal Rubens and Soldie r Santos, under the com mand of Major Maciel who was reportedly present as well. Arriving at the scene, the firem en saw that this was no strange anim al at all and realized the finding should be reported to the Arm y Sergeant School Com mand - Escola de Sargentos das Arm as (ESA) in ne ighboring Tres Coracoes, about ten m iles from Varginha. Before there could possibly be tim e fo r the Sergeant School to respond, an arm y truck appeared on the scene. The firem en understood that the high staff of ESA also had been inform ed about the incident. The creature was captured using nets and other equipm ent norm ally used to capture wild anim als. The still-living creature was placed in a one m eter square wooden box, which was covered with a resistant fabric and the whole affair was placed atop the arm y truck. The creature was curled up in the box and wrapped in net. The witnesses stated that it was em itting a buzzing sound sim ilar to a bee. The vehicle headed to the ESA. All personnel i nvolved were ordered by Lieutenant Colonel Wanderley to refrain from talk ing about the incident with any one else, telling the men it was a secret operation. Interestingly , Lt. Col. Wanderley ’s expertise was in atom ic- biological-chem ical warfare. Perhaps this is why he was put in charge of the operation even though there was a general in com mand of the ESA at the tim e. Policem an Marco Chereze was involved with the capture of one of the creatures. He touched the life form without protection. He died two w eeks later with a general infection. The fam ily showed Sr. Pacaccini the last blood exam , which showed that his blood contained 8% of an unknown toxic substance. According to Sr. Pacacci ni, the Varginha police departm ent has gone to great lengths to attem pt to prove that Sr. Chereze was not even working on January 20, 1996. However, the Chereze fam ily confirm s that he was indeed on duty that night, that he cam e hom e briefly to change clothes and inform them that he could not com e back for dinner because he would be working late on a m ission. After the first soldier gave the taped interview to Pacaccini and Rodrigues, a few other military people cam e forward to speak about the incident, under the condition that their identities would be kept secret. All those who cam e forw ard gave confidential ta ped interviews. All confirm ed that a second creature, probably the one seen by the three girls in the afternoon was captured the sam e night by personnel from the arm y, fire departm ent and police secret service. Through the investigative efforts of Pacaccini and R odrigues, m any of the details of the recovery operation are now known. The second creature, identical to the first, was taken alive to the regional hospital in Varginha. After spending a few hours at the regional hospita l, the creature was transferred to the better equipped Hum anitas Hospital. Two day s later, on the afternoon of January 22, the creature — now dead — was the subject of a huge and well-di sguised operation to rem ove it to the AS. A few nurses and other personnel from the regional hospital confirm ed som e facts, although they were suppressed for som e tim e after the incide nt. All individuals at Hum anitas Hospital who 398"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":" had contact with the creature were adm onished to not discuss it with any one, not even their relatives, and to specifically avoid the press and UFO researchers. Interviews with som e of the m ilitary m en involved in the rem ova l operation who gave confidential interviews reported that three arm y trucks were used, each with a two-m an team . They speculated that three trucks were used to rem ove one possibly extraterrestrial body so that none of the trucks would know who was indeed transporting the body of the creature. The Brazilian investigators have since determ ined these facts. The driving team s, although kept outside the hospital itself, observed details of the operation. Military personnel from Brazil’s S-2 — the Arm y internal intelligence section — was in charge of getting the corpse from the interior of the hospital, placing it ly ing down in a wooden box and then loading it into one of the trucks. All three trucks went back to ESA. The next m orning at 4:00 am , the trucks headed to another military facility located in Cam pinas in the state of Sao Paulo, a 200-m ile drive. There, the corpse was transferred to the University of Cam pinas, one of Brazil’s best institutions. The body was autopsied by Dr. Fortunato Badan Palhares, who gained worldwide acclaim as one of the best forensic doctors alive when he conducted the aut opsy of the fam ous Germ an Nazi Mengle, whose body was found in Brazil. However, Dr. Palhares has publicly denied having taken part in the autopsy of the creature found in January of 1996.   One year after the Varginha incident, another witness cam e forward — Joao Bosco Manoel. He called Sr. Pacaccini. He and Sr. Rodrigues m et with him and heard his story . He was an independent witness to the capture of the first creature. At approxim ately 10:45 am on January 20, Sr. Bosco was in the area selling fish door-to-door when his attention was diverted by a fire truck and firem en, but no evidence of a fire. He hid and watched the goings on. He observed six firem en hurriedly em erging from the bushes, followed by four firem en wearing big gloves and between them were carry ing the creature wrapped in a net. The life form was put into the truck and the men drove away . Sr. Bosco noticed an extrem ely acrid, am monia-like sm ell perm eating the open air. Sr. Bosco spoke at a press conference and m ade his story public, stating that he could identify at least two of the firem en. This caused som ething of an uproar due to the official denial surrounding the story . Sr. Bosco was intim idated and threatened following his press conference, and Sr. Pacaccini spent a great deal of tim e m eeting with him following threatening incidents. Sr. Bosco eventually m oved out of the state of Minas Gerais. The Brazilian media has widely reported on the incident and the m ajority of the population understands that the case is real and that the m ilitary and civil authorities are keeping the facts absolutely quiet. Researchers Pacaccini and Rodr igues have determ ined that the policem en involved in the captures have since been transfe rred and prom oted. For a period of tim e after the incident, the region where Varginha is located, in the southern part of the state of Minas Gerais, was experiencing one of the largest waves of UFO sightings ever registered, including reports of huge UFOs observed at close range and reported contacts with inhabitants. This event was covered on the front page of The Wall Street Journal Europe 94 although the article’s tone was very m uch tongue in cheek and is a good exam ple of m ainstream m edia reporting techniques discussed in section 4.1. 6.14 The Ariz ona Sightings - March 1997 94 Mof fett, Mat t, The Wal l Street Journal Europe, Jul y 1, 1996 399"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":" On March 13, 1997, fly ing objects traveled across a large portion of southern Arizona. Seen by thousands, videotaped by m any , evoking com ment from the m ilitary and governm ent, the most significant UFO event in a decade occupied a pr om inent place in the press and gained worldwide attention. The National UFO Reporting Center 95 in Seattle, Washington, received its first call at 8:16 pm on March 13. A retired police officer from Paulden, Arizona, sixty m iles north of Phoenix, called in to report observing five red lights in a cluster headed south. In less than two m inutes, another report cam e in from Prescott, fifteen m iles south of Paulden. It all broke loose after that, with multiple calls com ing in from Wickenburg to Tem pe. The Center’s director, Peter Davenport, who describes him self as usually skeptical about the reports received at the Center, stated: “The incident over Arizona was the m ost dram atic I’ ve seen...what we have here is the real thing. They are here.” 96 As the airborne objects cam e over the flight paths leading to the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport, more than one com mercial pilot radioed to the c ontrol tower asking for an identification of the lights. The air traffic controllers had no answers. They could visually see the objects, yet nothing unaccounted for appeared on their radar screens. Investigation subsequent to March 13 revealed that callers jam med police departm ent phone lines, as well as television and radio station phones. Luke Air Force Base near Phoenix was also besieged with calls of sighting reports as the objects traveled south over the greater Phoenix metropolitan area. The objects’ speed over greater Phoenix was estim ated by many observers as a leisurely 30 m iles per hour. This certainly sugg ests that the objects indeed wanted to be seen and videotaped. A variety of UFOs were reported: triangles, lights in a straight line, orbs in a V-shaped or delta form ation, an actual solid triangular-shape d object. Many witnesses stated that the lights seem ed to glow from within — they were very bright but did not shine or cast light. Most observers who saw them at closer range stated th e lights were white with orange to red edges and centers. Som e witnesses could discern a dim , dark shape behind the light form ation that distorted or blotted out the stars as it slowly passed. The Disclosure Project’ s director and research director spoke with a retired Air Force pilot on the evening of March 14 who saw the lights clearly from his hom e. He resides in Carefree, which is north of Phoenix and has m uch less light pollution than within the city . He described th e lights as silent, slow m oving and m aintaining a form ation. He stated that this was unlike any thing he had witnessed in the skies during his entire career as a m ilitary pilot. Regardless of the type of form ation seen, all observers agreed that the lights or objects were slow m oving, very large and totally silent. The size of the object was estim ated as being from 900 feet to m ore than a m ile in length. Com puter analy sis of witness’ s videotapes done by Village Labs in Tem pe m arked the length as 6,000 feet — well over a m ile long. Richard Price of USA Today, in an article appearing in the June 18, 1997 issue, interviewed witness Bill Greiner, who stated he would never be the sam e after the sighting. Mr. Greiner turned from a skeptic to som eone who saw what he describes as \"astonishing and a little frightening.\" Mr. Greiner, a cem ent truck driver, was hauling a load of cem ent down a mountain north of Phoenix when he saw two white, orange and red UFOs. He described them as having spinning tops. Greiner observed one of the orbs break away and fly over Luke Air Force Base. He stated that three F-16 fighter jets went in pursuit of the UFO. As the jets approached, the UFO shot straight up and quickly vanished. In Mr . Greiner’s words: \"It was crazy .

It’s like having 50,000 people in a stadium watch a football gam e and then ha ving som eone tell us we weren’t there.\" The analy ses of the am ateur video tapes unde rtaken at Village Labs by Jim Dilettoso and his partner Michael Tanner reveal that four different form ations or objects traveled from north to south on the evening of March 13, 1997. The transit across the region lasted 106 m inutes. The lights were uniform , did not vary in brightness or intensity across the span of each light, and did not glow. They were determ ined not to be aircraft lights, hologram s, lasers or m ilitary flares. Com parison with the lights on the Phoenix sky lin e seen in the videos shows the UFOs to be markedly unique. The residents of southern Arizona were in trigued, curious and expected an explanation from the civilian and m ilitary authorities. While sever al reports from various m ilitary personnel stated that the lights were flares being used during Na tional Guard war gam e m aneuvers, Mr. Dilettoso stated that investigation revealed the National Guard could not, would not and did not cause the lights that were seen by thousands of Arizonans on March 13, 1997. While jets from Luke Air Force Base were in the Phoenix skies on that night, a spokesm an from the base assured the press that the jets’ lights could not account for the sightings. Reacting to the groundswell com ing from the local citizenry , Phoenix Councilwom an Frances Barrows raised a question at a city council m eeting as to whether any one was conducting an official investigation. Instantly , the public sei zed upon her com ment and m ade her their \"official\" contact to the governm ent. Although Councilwom an Barrows said she did not see the objects herself, m any of her constituents did. When th e public and the m edia learned of her raising the question of an investigation, hundreds of calls were received from the curious citizens who now had a public servant upon whom to focus. But the city council, the m ayor’s office, the governor’s office and US Senator John McCain were unable to effect any official action. Sena tor McCain referred it to the US Air Force, who announced in June 1997 that it would do nothing to i nvestigate the incidents, referring it back to the local jurisdictions. And, of course, this would be the Air Force’s position since they have officially been out of the UFO investigation bus iness since the closure of Project Blue Book in 1969. Two years later, the above m entioned National UFO Reporting Center released a special update report on their web site 97 based on a significant am ount of evidence collected since the original sightings. The update substantiate d the earlier reports of both the objects size, appearance, and m ovem ents.

This sighting was researched by several organizations including NUFORC 98 , MUFON 99 , and NIDS 100 and later a TV docum entary 101 was aired which included excellent com puter sim ulations on what was seen based on all the various witness reports. The following sum mary description is quoted from the NUFORC report of the event. 102 “On Wednesday , January 05, 2000, the National UFO Reporting Center received two telephone messages (at 0316 and 0351 hrs. Pacific Standard Tim e) from Officer Thom as ‘Ed’ Barton, em ploy ed by the Lebanon, IL, Police Departm ent. The m essages apprised our Center that a UFO sighting had occurred in St. Clair County , Illinois, and in surrounding areas, at approxim ately 0410 hrs. (Central) earlier that m orning. “Later the sam e m orning, we were able to talk to Officer Barton, who reported to us the following: At approxim ately 0410 hrs. (Central) on that m orning, he overheard an announcem ent by the St. Clair (IL) Em ergency Dispatch operator that a citizen had entered the Highland, IL, police station, and requested that an officer go outside and view a very peculiar object that was hovering nearby in the sky . The citizen had witnessed the bizarre looking object on his way to work, and he apparently refused to leave the station until a police officer had viewed the object with him . “Having heard the announcem ent about the incident over his radio, Officer Barton looked to the southeast from his location in Lebanon, and noticed two extrem ely bright white lights suspended in the sky , close to the horizon. The tw o lights were radiating so m uch light that the spectacle rem inded Officer Barton of the Japan ese ‘Rising Sun’ sy mbol, used on the Japanese battle flag. A very short period of tim e later, th e two large lights appeared to merge into one, and the illum ination the object was radiating appeared to increase dram atically . “Officer Barton began driving south and east in attem pt to approach the object. He turned his overhead flashers on, and at tim es was driving at 75-80 M.P.H. toward the object, which was still generally to the southeast of his position. Afte r a short period of tim e, Officer Barton realized that the object appeared to be traveling toward him . “ He stopped his vehicle, extinguished his overhead flashers, and rolled down the window on the passenger side of his vehicle. The object a pproached his location, and passed overhead at an estim ated altitude of 1,000 to 1,500 feet, and within an estim ated 100 feet lateral distance of his position on the ground. It was headed generally to the west, or northwest, at this tim e. The object was distinctly triangular in shape, with th ree white lights on the apices of the triangle, and   98 National UFO Report ing C enter 99 Mu tual UFO Netwo rk 100 The National Institute for Discovery Science 101 “UFO Over Il linoi s: Anat omy of a Si ght ing”, Di scovery C hannel , 2000 102 Report prepared by: Peter B.

(Note: Officer Barton, in m ultiple telephone conve rsations with our organization, and during at least one radio broadcast, has em phasized how alm ost unbelievably quickly the object accelerated and m oved a considerable distance to the southwest in just a few seconds.

He recom mended that dispatch contact units to the south and west of his position, e.g. Shiloh, Millstadt and Dupo, to have the officers there atte mpt to spot the object from their vantage points. “Apparently at least one officer from Shiloh, IL, witnessed the object next, and two other officers, who have not com e forward and who appa rently do not wish to be identified, witnessed the object while they were standing in the cem etery of their town, as well. “An officer from the Millstadt Police Departm ent, Officer Craig Stevens, with whom NUFORC also spoke, overheard the broadcast, and m ove d his cruiser to a dark part of that town to see if he could spot the object in the night sky . He quickly spotted the object to the west of his location, at approxim ately 45 degrees above the hor izontal plane, and gauged its size as ‘huge.’ He estim ated that it was ‘one or two stories tall, and perhaps three stories long.’ It had several very bright lights on it. “St. Clair Dispatch requested that som eone, if possible, attem pt to get a photograph of the object. In response to that request, Officer Stev ens rem oved Polaroid-ty pe cam era stored in the trunk of his cruiser and quickly photographed the object. Because the outside tem perature was low, approxim ately 18-20°F, neither the cam era, nor the film functioned well, so the resolution of the photograph is not good. “After Officer Stevens had taken the photogr aph, the object appeared to m ove further to the west, m oving toward Dupo, IL, Cahokia, IL, and St . Louis, MO. A Dupo police officer may have witnessed the object at that tim e. “In the final analy sis, the police departm ents and com munities involved in the incident include the following: Highland, Sum merfield, Leba non, Shiloh, Mascoutah, Millstadt, Dupo, and Cahokia, Illinois.

Craddock with assistance from Dr. Paul LaViolette and other researchers Since the tim e of the great Nikola Tesla (and before), a sm all sector of the scientific com munity has known that so-called “free energy ” can be extracted from our surroundings, and that many other exotic forces and effects, such as “anti-gravity ”, are also waiting to be liberated at our beck and call. In his 1899 Colorado Springs experim ents, T esla discovered the electro-gravitational (or scalar) wave, which oscillate the energy density of the vacuum and hence oscillate the curvature of space-tim e. So, over a century ago, it appears that Tesla had already produced a unified field theory of gravitation and electrom agnetics. His discoveries were so fundam ental, and his intent to provide free energy for all hum ankind was so clear, that it was probably responsible for the withdrawal of his financial backing, his deliberat e isolation, and the gradual rem oval of his nam e from the history books. The zero-point energy of a vacuum is the lowest energy vacuum state, with fluctuations taken into account. Even at low energies, quantum fluc tuations continually arise, and result in an incessant, extrem ely rapid and violent \"jittering\" of the energy momentarily present. The minim um energy due to these quantum fluctuations is called the zero-point energy . The am ount of this energy is HUGE . Som e scientists have hy pothesized that one cubic centim eter of pure vacuum contains enough energy to condense into 10 80 – 10 120 gram s of m atter! Quantum mechanically , no sy stem of interest (including even space-tim e itself) can have zero energy . The so-called “free energy ” is actually obtained by tapping into the above-described zero-point energy . The bedrock of m uch of modern science is Classical Electrom agnetic Theory (CEM). Jam es Clark Maxwell developed this 136 y ears ago in an exotic algebra known as quaternions. In order to render it more assim ilable for use by working electrody nam icists, it was deliberately re-written in m uch sim pler language by Oliver Heavisid e (and Gibbs) in 1903. This sim plification (and truncation) elim inated a whole subset of the equations including the scalar electrom agnetics and the gravitational aspects that were contained in the original theory . At last count, there are at least thirty -four known flaws in Clark Maxwell’ s hoa ry old theory , which is what is still taught in today ’s classroom s. Som e of the world’ s leading scientists, such as Wheeler, Fey nman, Bunge, Margenau, Barrett, Cornille, Evans, Vigier, and Lehnert have all written about CEM’s deficiencies. When this m issing “Heaviside subset” of Classi cal Electrom agnetic Theory is restored, and the brilliant 1903 and 1904 work of a Cam bridge Un iversity m athem atician, E.T. Whittaker, factored in, all of a sudden one has the supposedly elusive Holy Grail of Science – a true Unified 404"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":" Field Theory that unites General Relativity , Quantum Mechanics, Mind and Subtle Energy Phenom ena and Classical EM Theory . But in fact, for the advancem ent of hum anity , the real Holy Grail could be argued to actually be contained in this m issing subset, not in th e m ore grandiose sounding Unified Field Theory . For it is this “scalar potential” that stresses local space-tim e, i.e. the 3 spatial dim ensions AND tim e, which allows the “bleed-through” of additi onal electrom agnetic energy to create overunity electrom agnetic sy stem s. Indeed, the restoration of this m issing subset also shows that Einstein’ s Theory of General Relativity was also only a subset of the real theory that he was try ing to write. Even though Einstein has been lionized for his theory of General Relativity (Tim e Magazine “Man of the Century ”), he him self is on record as say ing that the so-called foundations of phy sics need constant review, and that his Relativity Theory was not necessarily cast in concrete. A further im pedim ent to the theoretical extrac tion of “free” energy was also im posed on what was left of Maxwell’s already diluted EM Theory by H.A. Lorentz around 1902. He sim ply arbitrarily threw away the m onstrous am ount of current outside the circuit that was not intercepted by the circuit, and that he could not theoretically account for. This he term ed “of no phy sical significance!” – even though it is approxim ately 10 13 tim es greater than the intercepted current in our every day electrical circuits! He thus perpetually locked EM sy stem s in a theoretical and figurative iron box that would neve r allow them to go overunity and bleed in and capture additional energy . Energy cannot be created or destroy ed, and exam ples abound of where sy stem s (such as heat- pum ps or windm ills) put out m ore energy than they take in, sim ply by transducing other energy sources. This is called overunity , when the out putted energy added to additional transduced energy from another source puts out m ore energy than is provided by the original prim ary source. Conventional science “allows” this in every aspect of “conventional science” WITH THE SOLE (ARBITRARY) EXCEPTION OF ELECTROMAGNETISM. But, by not “allowing” the curvature of space-tim e locally , which is a way to open the gate to the “free” vacuum energy , one can well see why som e entrenched econom ic interests have discouraged investigation of this phy sicist into this awesom e source of energy . Indeed, we have been told that the US Patent Offi ce has strict instructions not to allow any Patent for a m eaningful overunity electrom agnetic sy stem or one that would appear to threaten the status quo of our present power suppliers. Occasionally , however, the veil does inadvertently get lifted on som e of the wondrous suppressed overunity sy stem s, only to quickly be dropped again. Here are a few exam ples: Tesla’s Self-Powered Automobile In 1931, in a very secret program , Tesla built an overunity , self-powered electrical power system , placed it in a Pierce Arrow autom obile, and ran the car around successfully . A relative who rode with him in the car confir med it m any years later. Som e details are described in Marc Seifer’ s biography of Tesla as follows: \"The car [was] a standard Pierce Arrow, with the engine removed and other components installed instead. The standard clutch, gear box, and drive train remained... Under the hood, 405"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":" there was a brushless electric motor, connected to [or in place of] the engine... Tesla would not divulge who made the motor.\" \"Set into the dash was a \"power receiver\" consisting of a box... containing 12 radio tubes... A vertical antenna, consisting of a 6 ft. rod, was installed and connected to the power receiver [ which was] in turn, connected to the motor by two heavy, conspicuous cables... Tesla pushed these in before starting and said: ‘We now have power.\" This Tesla device seem s to have been rem arkably sim ilar to the radiant energy am plifier of T. Henry Moray described below. Also, Tesla coined the term “radiant energy ” with respect to natural m edia in two of his patents. Further, we have Barrett’s m athem atical dem ons tration that Tesla’ s actual patented circuits, when viewed in a higher topology , did indeed freely shuttle energy in the circuit as desired. In short, it appears that Tesla knew how to m ake circuits that asy mmetrically self-regauged them selves creating overunity sy stem s and therefore self-powering sy stem s. This is an entirely different operation than just the present entropic transfer of voltage used by electrical engineers today . It is more akin to deliberately regauging desired sections of the circuit, so that excess energy appears there from an external source. In short, it is akin to asy mmetrical self-regauging, and also to the ty pe of operati on of circuits that Kron (discussed below) discovered so laboriously but never entirely revealed. No technical details were ever released on how Tesla’ s self-powered autom obile sy stem worked. The Tesla papers eventually turned ove r to his native country did not contain the actual \"critical\" papers present in his room at the tim e of his death. Those \"critical\" papers were illegally rem oved from his room as if Tesla were an illegal alien (he was a naturalized U.S. citizen, so the entire action was blatantly illegal). If those \"critical\" papers are still in existence, then they are still highly classified and hidden from conventional scientists. Cheney in her biography on Tesla reports finding the location of those papers. The free energy electrical autom otive power system part of Tesla’ s work was financed by the sam e world financier who financed Adolph Hitler’ s rise to power as well as m uch of the early Com munist takeover of Russia. It is speculated that because of this financial control, Tesla would not have been allowed to put that car into production by one of the U.S. autom otive com panies Som e recent references and patents based in part on Tesla’ s work are as follows: Barrett, T.W ., \"Tesla’s Nonlinear Os cillator-Shuttle-Circuit (OSC) Theory ,\" Annales de la Fondation Louis de Broglie , 16(1), 1991, p. 23-41.

Henry Moray of Salt Lake City produced his first device to tap energy from the m etafrequency oscillations of em pty space itself. Eventually he produced a free energy device weighing sixty pounds and producing 50, 000 watts of electricity for several hours. Ironically , although he dem onstrated his device rep eatedly to scientists and engineers, he was unable to obtain funding to develop the device into a useable power station that would furnish electrical power on a m ass scale. In the 1920’ s and 1930’ s Moray steadily im proved his devices, particularly his detector tube, the only real secret of the device according to Moray him self. In his book 103 , The Sea of Energy in Which the Earth Floats, Moray presents docum ented evidence that he invented the first transistor-ty pe valve in 1925, far ahead of the offici ally recognized discovery of the transistor. In his free energy detector tube Moray apparently used, inside the tube itself, a variation of this transistor idea — a sm all rounded pellet of a mixture of tribolum inescent zinc, a sem iconductor material, and a radioactive or fissile m aterial. His patent application (for which a patent has never been granted) was filed on July 13, 1931, long before the advent of the Bell Laboratories’ transistor. In test after test Moray dem onstrated his radiant energy device to electrical engineering professors, congressm en, dignitaries, and a host of othe r visitors to his laboratory . Once he even took the device several miles out in the country , away from all power lines, to prove that he was not sim ply tuning in to energy being clandestinely radiated from som e other part of his laboratory . Several tim es he allowed independe nt investigators to com pletely disassem ble his device and reassem ble it, then reactivate it them sel ves. In all tests, he was successful in dem onstrating that the device could produce energy output without any appreciable energy input. According to exhaustive docum entation, no one w as ever able to prove that the device was fraudulent or that Moray had not accom plished exactly what he claim ed. The records are full of signed statem ents from skeptical phy sicists, electrical engineers, and scientists who cam e to the Moray laboratory and le ft with the com plete conviction that Moray had indeed succeeded in tapping a universal source of energy that could produce free electrical power. But in the face of all of this, the U.S. Patent Office refused to grant Moray a patent, first, because his device used a cold cathode in the t ubes (the patent exam iner asserted it was com mon knowledge that a heated cathode was necessary to obtain electrons) and, second, because he failed to identify the source of the energy . All sorts of irrelevant patents and devices were also presented as being infringed upon or duplicated by Moray ’s work. Each of these objections was patiently answered and nullified by Moray ; nonetheless, the patent has still not been issued to this day , although the Moray s still keep the patent application current. John Moray , who operates the Research Institute in Salt Lake City , has been try ing to continue his father’s work since the basic un it was destroy ed by a Russian double agent.

A negative resistor is defined as any com ponent or function or process that receives energy in unusable or disordered form and outputs that ener gy in usable, ordered form , where that is the net function perform ed. We specifically do not include \"differential\" negative resistors such as the tunnel diode, thy ristor, and m agnetr on which dissipate and disorder m ore energy overall than they order in their \"negative resistance\" regim es. It appears that the availability of the Heav iside energy com ponent surrounding any portion of the circuit m ay be the long sought secret to Gabriel Kron’ s \"open path\" that enabled him to produce a true negative resistor in the 1930s, as th e chief scientist for General Electric on the U.S. Navy contract for the Network Analy zer at St anford University . Kron was never perm itted to release how he m ade his negative resistor, but did state that, when placed in the Network Analy zer, the generator could be disconnected because the negative resistor would power the circuit. This negative resistor, one m ight a dd, was developed at the expense of the U.S. Taxpay er. Since a negative resistor converges surrounding en ergy and diverges it into the circuit, it appears that Kron’s negative resistor gathered energy from the Heaviside com ponent of energy flow as an \"open path\" flow of energy — connecting together the local vicinities of any two separated circuit com ponents — that had been discarded by previous electrody nam icists following Lorentz. Hence Kron referred to it as the \"open path.\" Kron describes this as follows 104 : \"...the missing concept of \"open-paths\" (the dual of \"closed-paths\") was discovered, in which currents could be made to flow in branc hes that lie between any set of two nodes. (Previously — following Maxwell — engineers tied all of their open-paths to a single datum point, the ‘ground’). That discovery of open-paths established a second rectangular transformation matrix... which created ‘lamellar’ cu rrents...\" \"A network with the simultaneous presence of both closed and open paths was the answer to the author’s years-long search.\" A true negative resistor appears to have been developed by Kron. He described his apparent success in 1945 stating 105 : \" When only positive and negative real numbers exist, it is customary to replace a positive resistance by an inductance and a negative resistance by a capacitor (since none or only a few negative resistances exist on practical network analyzers).\" Apparently Kron was required to insert the words \"none or\" in that statem ent. He also wrote that 106 : \" Although negative resistances are available for use with a network analyzer,...\" suggesting in rather certain term s that negative resistors were available for use on the network analy zer.   104 Kron, Gabri el, \"The f rust rating search f or a geom etrical model of elect rodynami c net works,\" ci rca 1962. 105 Kron, Gabriel, \"Numerical soluti on of ordinary and partial differential e quations by means of equivalent circui ts,\" Journal of Appl ied Physi cs, Vol . 16, Mar. 1945, p. 173. 106 Kron, Gabri el, “El ect ric ci rcui t model s of the Schr ödi nger equat ion,” Phys.

The Astronauts’ Magnetic Boots In the original m agnetic boots for astronauts developed by Radus et al . at Westinghouse, the magnetic fields them selves — from permanent magnets — were sim ply switched! The astronaut could pick up his foot by sim ply switching off the perm anent m agnetic fields easily . They switched on again when he placed the foot down. He did not have to carry a huge battery around with him , to furnish enorm ous current to do that . And the m agnets had a m emory. (So far as is known, even today no one tells you that in many virgin m agnets fresh from the factory , their very first use conditions them with a m emory! That fact can be used, for example, to create magnets whose fields appear normal, but which deviate from the normal behavior of ordinary magnets, including produce anomalies in their magnetic fields. It can easily be seen that, when one can switc h a perm anent m agnet’ s fields easily , and the magnet also has a built-in memory as did the Radus m agnets, then with a little ingenuity in switching one could use such switchable m agne ts to produce a self-switching, self-powered perm anent magnet motor. The magnet, being a perm anent dipole, is already a particular kind of \"free energy generator\", since it continuously ga tes magnetic energy directly from the vacuum due to its asy mmetry in the energetic vacuum flux.

On July 9, 1998 in a key note address at the Fifth International Conference on Com posites Engineering in Las Vegas, she reported having observed appare nt negative resistance in interfaces between lay ers of carbon fibers in a com posite m aterial. The negative resistance was observed in a direction perpendicular to the fiber lay ers. Her team tested the negative resistance effect t horoughly , for a y ear in the laboratory . There is no question at all about it being a true negative resistor. Dr. Chung subm itted a paper describing the research to a peer-reviewed journal, and the University filed a patent application. Several negative articles appeared quickly in th e popular scientific press. Conventional scientists were quickly quoted as proclaim ing that negative resistance was against the laws of phy sics and therm ody nam ics.

Dr. Randell Mills and Blacklight Power In early 1989, Dr. Randell Mills discovered that the hy drogen atom could be collapsed below its ground state and give up significant am ounts of energy . At first, it was thought that he had discovered a new form of cold fusion. However, he showed that his discovery was indeed a new form of energy from the collapse of the hy drogen at om (which he calls hy drinos). An early report showed as m uch as 1,000 tim es as m uch energy out as input energy . This excellent am ount of therm al energy was attributed to the cataly tic reactions that provide a receptor for the energy em itted when the hy drogen collapses.

M ead Jr. and Jack Nacham kin for a sy stem for converting electrom agnetic radiation energy to el ectrical energy . This is actually a proof of principle (using the Casim ir effect) in that it defin itely proves that there are way s to extract usable EM energy from the vacuum . It only takes one white crow to prove that not all crows are black! And that is definitely a fine little white crow. But the most ubiquitous gate of all for “free energy ” is the sim ple little source dipole. The dipole becom es a universal kind of negative resistor extracting EM energy from the vacuum . Specifically it absorbs energy from the tim e-dom ain (c om plex plane) and em its the energy in real 3-space. Unfortunately , lack of space precludes further discussion of this. Anti-Gravity and Electro-gravitics There are two m agic rules in the scalar electrogravitational business: (1) When ordinary EM force fields are interfere d or sum med so that they produce vector zero, they produce stress of vacuum (5-potential). On e com ponent of this 5-potential is the 4-space G- potential. Since bleed-off as a gradient of this 4- space G-potential is all that is allowed, then the EM destructive interference/zero sum mation bl eeds-off to produce gravitational force field. In short, destructive interference of EM wa ves or force fields produces gravitational force field on detecting/coupled particles. (2) When electrogravitational fields are inte rfered/sum med to produce vector zero, this destructive interference/zero sum mation bleeds-o ff to produce ordinary electrom agnetic force field. In short, destructive interference of scalar EM waves or fields (electrogravitational waves or fields) produces electrom agnetic force fields on detecting/coupled particles. Thus the age-old scientific dream of direct engineering of gravitational field - and of space- tim e itself - has now becom e reality . To start, one sim ply m akes an EM vector zero and varies its stress intensity and internal pattern of sum med com ponents. One also varies the reference potential at which the patterned EM stress zer o is created, and the frequency of internal com ponent variation. 415"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":" Here is the secret of antigravity : The \"electrical charge\" of a charged particle - such as one of the orbital electrons of an atom or one of the protons of its nucleus - represents a difference in flux intensity (potential) between the local particle and its am bient vacuum . It’s the continual bleed-off of gravitational charge as electrical charge. If that bleed-off is reversed or stopped, a dr astic effect on the gravitational potential and charge ensues. The 5-potential and 5-charge have becom e 4-G-potential and 4-d-charge respectively . Thus \"charging\" an object with its scalar EM pattern charges it gravitationally . Now the only \"bleed-off channel\" is through the 4-G force field. Further, in a nucleus, the nucleons continually change back and forth between proton and neutron, so the electrical charge is \"spread \" throughout the nucleus and shared by all the nucleons. Further, each elem ent (actually each isotope) has its own unique \"ensem ble pattern\" of Fourier expansion scalar frequencies, am plitudes, et c. This pattern, of course, can be reproduced artificially and transm itted by m odified EM transm itters (i.e., by scalar EM transm itters). There is, however, a sort of \"m aster key \" scalar EM (E G) pattern for nucleons (protons and neutrons which are changing back and forth into each othe r by exchange of virtual charge currents). If one \"reverses the charge\" by inverting this pattern, and then \"charges up a m ass with the inverted charge,\" to the external observer the charging m ass just gets lighter and lighter, and its inertia gets less and less. Eventually it seem s (to him ) to acquire negative mass and negative inertia, and just accelerate away from the Earth. The object \"falls upward\" instead of \"falling downwards.\" There are also som e weird tim e effects; that object can be m oving slower through tim e than the laboratory observer, or even be m oving backwards through tim e with respect to the laboratory observer. (Don’t believe every thing they taught you in relativity ; few of those involved had ever engineered a single general relativistic situation. Nothing they teach in GR is based on direct experim ent. Most of what they teach is al ready experim entally proven to be in error. ) Inside the pattern itself, it’ s just a quite norm al pattern. No change in or on the object seem s to have occurred, to it, if the charge is even ly accom plished throughout the object. Indeed, to an internal observer it’ s the external environm ent that seem s to have suddenly gotten very strange! For exam ple it appears that this is what occasiona lly happens to a hapless aircraft or ship that experiences anom alous spatiotem poral difficulty in an occasionally scalar- active area such as the infam ous Berm uda triangle. Under the right c onditions, the vehicle’s gravitational charge is affected by anom alous changes in the scalar ra diation from the Earth in that area. To the passengers and crew, it is the external environm ent that suddenly seem s weird. In addition, on- board EM and inertial instrum ents m ay be aff ected, and other electrogravitational effects m ay also occur, due to differing rates of charge in different parts of the vehicle.). \"Reversing or lowering the EG-charge\" is c ontrolled by m eans of biasing the ground potential on the ensem ble pattern transm itters.

By fiddling with this, you can float m etal. Or a hum an body . Or a battleship. Or a high- speed vehicle containing a crew. You can even \"dem aterialize it\" or \"teleport it.\" In the “Philadelphia Experim ent” in the 1940s, the test ship, the m inesweeper IX97 (originally the y acht “Martha’s Viney ard”) and its personnel were \"blasted\" into this strange realm , instead of m aking a gentle, controlled entry . Nicola Tesla, virtually on his deathbed, had instructed the scientific team involved how to do this. (See Bob Beckwith’ s book “Hy potheses” – Beckwith was a GE scientist on the team ). Th e results of this experim ent, which produced inadvertent tim e travel from the experim ental sh ip’s location to another location and back and produced horrendous results (crew m embers were fused through the deck etc.), are slated for de- classification in 2002, according to private sources. Suppose one m aterially lowers or reverses (adj usts) the gravitational charge (gravitation 5- potential with zero-sum med EM to throttle EM bl eed-off). At zero gravitational charge, to the external observer, the vehicle seem s to have no m ass and no inertia . It is capable of extrem e accelerations, right angle turns at full speed, etc. It is also right on the point of dem aterialization, and appears to be a vehicle of light. If the pilot wishes to \"land,\" of course he must adjust the charge on the vehicle. If the pilot wishes to \"dem aterialize\" or \"tele port,\" again he m ust adjust the charge on the vehicle. If he wishes to go \"hy perspatial,\" again he m ust adjust the charge on the vehicle and allow the proper bleed-off to produce a hy perspatial force. That is done with nested zero sum mations and nested patterns of scalar EM transm ission. That is, he can charge and bias the ve hicle in m ultiple, nested zero-sum mations sim ultaneously . That is necessary for hy perspatial control and travel. Note that in lower hy perspace the vehicle can do som e very strange things.

Townsend Brown’s Technology of Electrogravitics In the mid 1920’ s Townsend Brown discovered that electric charge and gravitational m ass are coupled.

His im portant findings were opposed by conventional m inded phy sicists of his tim e. The Pearl Harbor Dem onstration. Around 1953, Brown conducted a dem onstration for top brass from the military . He flew a pair of 3-foot diam eter discs around a 50-foot course tethered to a central pole.

LaViolette later obtained it from Wright Patterson through interlibrary lo an. It is now published in the book Electrogravitics Systems , T. Valone (editor).\" Northrop’s Wind Tunnel Tests. In 1968, engi neers at the Northrop Corp. perform ed wind tunnel tests in which they charged the leading edge of a wing to a high voltage. They were investigating how this technique could be used beneficially to soften the sonic boom of aircraft. Hence they were perform ing large-scale tests on Brown’ s electrogravitic concept. Brown’ s R&D com pany had previously m ade known that sonic boom softening would be a beneficial side effect of this electrogravitic propulsion technique. Interestingly , Northrop later becam e the prim e contractor for the B-2 bom ber. The B-2 Bom ber. In 1992, black project scientists disclosed to Aviation Week and Space Technology m agazine that the B-2 electrostatically ch arges its exhaust to a high voltage and also charges the leading edge of its wing-like body to the opposite polarity . This inform ation led Dr. LaViolette in 1993 to reverse engineer the B-2’s propulsion sy stem . He proposed that the B-2 is essentially a realization of Townsend Brown’ s patented electrogravitic aircraft. The B-2 is capable of taking off under norm al jet propulsion. But when airborne, its electrogravitic drive may be switched on for added thrust. This sy stem can only be turned on under dry conditions. If the B-2’ s dielectric wing were to becom e wet, the applied high voltage charge would short out, which explains why the B-2 is unable to fly in the rain. Brown’s electrogravitic experim ents and a field theory that LaViolette had develope d (1985, 1994a) both suggest that the B-2’s high voltage space charge differential sets up a gravity gradient from fore to aft that assists the craft’ s forward m ovem ent. LaViolette’s theory suggest s that the aftward m ovem ent of charges around the B-2 may contribute an even larger gravitational thrust effect, an effect also seen in Brown’ s electrokinetic experim ents. With electrogravitic drive, the B-2 is able to drastically cut its fuel consum ption, possibly even to zero under high-speed flight conditions. The com mercial airline industry could dram atically benefit with this technology , whic h would not only substantially increase the miles per gallon fuel efficiency of jet airliners, but would also perm it high-speed flight that would dram atically cut flight tim e. The m ovem ent of the charges m ay contribute an even larger thrust effect. The sam e would apply to the B-2 bom ber. 419"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":" Sid Hurwich In 1969, Toronto inventor Sid Hurwich dem ons trated his gravitational field m anipulation device to the Toronto police. Inspector Bill Dolt on, the Chief of the Holdup Squad, contributed his service revolver for the dem onstration. The revolver was then frozen onto the table, and he was unable to lift the pistol or pull the trigger. After a half hour or so in the room for the experim ent, clocks and watches had not change d their tim e from the tim e of entry , showing a strong space-tim e curvature. The device was subsequently used in the Is raeli’s raid on Entebbe, Uganda on July 3 rd , 1976 and later described in the Vancouver Sun Tim es’ Weekend Magazine Decem ber 17 th , 1977, p.17. “Israel’s Secret Weapon.” In several fascinating papers 112 published in the y ear 2000, Brazilian Phy sics Professor Fran De Aquino shows that by m anipulation of the gravitational field he was able to: extract energy directly from the gravitational field, and levitate a 77 lb. toroidal object two feet in diam eter using extra-low frequency radiation. Professor De Aquino is a Professor in the Phy sics Departm ent at Maranhao State University , S. Luis/MA, Brazil. Professor De Aquino advises that the papers were peer reviewed by 36 scientists, up to and including a Nobel laureate. The Searl Electrogravity Disc and Russian Experim ents. This device, developed over 40 years ago by the British engineer John Searl, consisted of a segm ented rotating disc each of whose segm ents was supported by a set of cylindrical perm anent magnets rolling within a circum ferential track. It is alleged to have achie ved com plete lift off. In the past few y ears two Russian scientists associated with the Russian National Academ y of Sciences, Roschin and Godin , have built a sim plified version of the Searl Disc that confirm s its anom alous weight loss effects. They spun a 1 m diam eter disc at 600 rpm and obtained a 35% reduction in its weight while at the sam e tim e generating a 7 kilowatt excess electric power output. The Podkletnov Gravity Shield and Project Greenglow. A research team in Finland led by Dr. Podkletnov was experim enting with a rota ting superconducting disc that was floated on a repelling m agnetic field generated by a series of electrom agnets. In 1996, they reported that the disc was able to partially screen the Earth’ s gravitational field, reducing the weight of objects positioned above the disc by two percent. Greater weight reductions are envisioned by stacking several discs over one another. Besides propulsion, there are obvious applications to tapping the resulting gravity differential for m echanical power generation. In the last few y ears, BAE Sy stem s a com pany form ed by the merger of Br itish Aerospace with Marconi Electronic Sy stem s, has been researching the Podkletnov gravity shie ld. They are doing this work under Project Greenglow, a project they have set up to investigate the feasibility of nonconventional technologies. Gravito Inertial Lift Sy stem . Aerospace engineer Jim Cox has recently im proved on the Dean Drive, an inertial propulsion engine that was patented in May 1959. He reports tests dem onstrating an upward thrust equal to 90% of the engine’ s weight. It uses a 1/4 horsepower motor to revolve two counter-rotating rotors, each a bout 1 cm in diam eter, spinning them at about 600 rpm for a power consum ption of about 200 watts. The lift is gotten by sinusoidally oscillating the rotors up and down and coupling them to the lift platform on their upward stroke.   112 “How to Extract Energy Directly from a Gravitational Field”, “Possibility of C ontrol of the Gravitational Mass by Means of Ext ra-Low Frequenci es Radi ation”, and ”Gravi tation and El ect romagnet ism: C orrel ation and Grand Unification” 420"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":" He obtains about 45 pounds of lift force per hor sepower (~55 pounds/kW).

He estim ates that usi ng this technology a 200 horsepower autom obile engine would be capable of gene rating a lift force of about 9000 pounds. Kineto-baric Field Propulsion. Germ an scientist Rudolph Z insser discovered that sawtooth electrom agnetic waves could be m ade to push dist ant objects. He produced a radio tube circuit that transm itted 45 megahertz radio waves having a sharp rise and gradual fall. His experim ents dem onstrated that these waves could exert im pulses of up to 10 4 to 10 5 dy ne seconds, which is equivalent to the application of about 1 to 3 ounces of force for a period of one second. He found that this force could be generated with an am azingly low input power, the output-force-to-input- power ratio surpassing that of conventional propulsion m ethods by several powers of ten. His projections im ply a thrust of 1350 pounds force per kilowatt. Field Thrust Experim ents on Piezoelectrics. Jam es Woodward , a phy sics professor at Cal State Fullerton, is conducting research that i ndicates that electrom agnetic waves can induce lifting forces in piezoelectric ceram ic m edia. His ideas are described in a 1994 U.S. patent and in a 1990 phy sics journal article. Woodward has conduc ted experim ents that confirm this thrust effect in the audio frequency range (~10,000 Hertz) , and his calculations suggest that it m ay be substantially increased at higher frequencies, w ith optim al perform ance being obtained in the microwave range (0.1 to 10 gigahertz).

Rockef eller to review phy sical evidence purported to be associated with UFO events. This was the fi rst m ajor review of these issues by the scientific com munity in nearly 3 decades and the results were reported in the national m edia. The abstract of the workshop proceedings (which was publishe d in the Journal of Scientific Exploration 113 ) is reprinted below.

Seven UFO investigators presented a variety of phy sical evidence that they claim ed was associated with UFO reports: photographic evid ence; lum inosity estim ates; radar evidence; interference with autom obile functioning; inte rference with aircraft equipm ent; apparent gravitational or inertial effects; ground traces; injuries to vegetation; phy siological effects on witnesses; and analy sis of debris. There was in addition a presentation of investigations into recurrent phenom ena that occur in the Hessdalen Valley in Norway . A review panel was com posed of nine scientists of diverse expertise and interests. The panel offered com ments and criticism s concerning the investigations that were presented, and also prepared a sum mary of their overall res ponse, with the following key elem ents:   113 Sturrock, P.

However, to be credible, such evaluations m ust take place with a spirit of objectivity and a willingness to evaluate rival hy potheses. ¾ The best prospect for achieving a m eaningful evaluation of relevant hy potheses is likely to com e from the exam ination of phy sical evidence. ¾ The chances of a significant advance are cons idered to be greater now than at the tim e of the Colorado Project that led to the Condon Report thirty years ago, because of advances in scientific knowledge and technical capabilities, and in view of the exam ple of a modest but effective UFO research project provided by the French space agency CNES. Stanford University News Service News Release, 6/22/98 Scientific panel concludes some UFO evidence worthy of study In the first independent review of UFO phe nom ena since 1970, a panel of scientists has concluded that som e sightings are accom panied by phy sical evidence that deserves scientific study . But the panel was not convinced that any of this evidence points to a violation of known natural laws or the involvem ent of an extraterrestrial intelligence. The review was organized and directed by Peter Sturrock, professor of applied phy sics at Stanford University , and supported adm inistrativel y by the Society for Scientific Exploration, which provides a forum for research into unexplai ned phenom ena. The international review panel of nine phy sical scientists responded to presentati ons by eight investigators of UFO reports, who were asked to present their strongest data. V on R. Eshlem an, professor em eritus of electrical engineering at Stanford, co-chaired the panel. Although UFO reports date back 50 years, the info rm ation gathered does not prove that either unknown phy sical processes or alien technologies are im plicated. But it does include a sufficient num ber of intriguing and inexplicable observations, the panel concluded. “It m ay be valuable to carefully evaluate UFO reports to extract inform ation about unusual phenom ena currently unknown to science.” To be credible to the scien tific com munity “such evaluations m ust take place with a spirit of objectivity and a willingness to evaluate rival hy potheses” that has so far been lacking, it added. This conclusion differs from that reached by Dr . Edward U. Condon, director of the Colorado Project, in his 1968 UFO report. He concluded that “further extensive study of UFOs probably cannot be justified in the expectation that science will be advanced thereby .” It is very sim ilar, however, to the conclusion reached by the Am eri can Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics’ Kuettner Report issued two y ears later, which advocated “a continuing, moderate-level [research] 423"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":" effort with em phasis on im proved data coll ection by objective m eans and on high-quality scientific analy sis.” In the current study , the scientific panel focused on incidents involving som e form of phy sical evidence, including photographic evidence, radar evid ence, vehicle interference, interference with aircraft equipm ent, apparent gravitational or in ertial effects, ground traces, injuries to vegetation, phy siological effects on witnesses, and debris. Of particular concern are reports that UFO encounters m ay be hazardous to people’ s hea lth. Som e witnesses have reportedly suffered radiation-ty pe injuries. These reports led the panel to draw the attention of the medical com munity to the possible health risks involved. The scientists found that som e of the reported in cidents m ay have been caused by rare natural phenom ena, such as electrical activity high above thunderstorm s or radar ducting (the trapping and conducting of radar waves by atm ospheric cha nnels). However, the panel found that som e of the phenom ena related to UFOs are not easy to explain in this fashion. Further analy sis of the evidence presented to th e panel is unlikely to shed added light on the causes underly ing the reports, the scientists said. Most current UFO investigations lack the level of rigor required by the scientific com munity , despite the initiative and dedication of the investigators involved. But new data, scientifi cally acquired and analy zed, could y ield useful inform ation and advance our understanding of the UFO problem , the panel said. The reviewers also m ade the following observations: ¾ The UFO problem is not a sim ple one, and it is unlikely that there is any sim ple, universal answer. ¾ Whenever there are unexplained observations, there is the possibility that scientists will learn som ething new by study ing them . ¾ Studies should concentrate on cases that include as m uch independent phy sical evidence as possible. ¾ Continuing contact between the UFO com munity and phy sical scientists could be productive. ¾ Institutional support for research in this area is desirable.

The full text of the report in English is included in th e Appendix in Volum e II. The coverage of this major study on UFO issues was very poorly covered in the US press with a notable exception of Leslie Kean’ s article which appeared in the Boston Globe 115 , a copy of which is included in Appendix I. A short presentation by Gildas Bourdais It m ust be stressed here that this is an i ndependent report, by a private association called COMETA. It is sum marized with the approval of the authors. To translate and publish the report itself, in part or in its integrality , perm ission should be asked by writing to the adm inistrator of the association COMETA, Mr. Michel Algrin, 25, boulevard Saint-Germ ain, 75005 Paris, France. On Friday 16 of July 1999 was published in France an outstanding docum ent, called “UFOs and Defense. What m ust we be prepared for?” (“Les OVNI et la Défense. A quoi doit-on se preparer ? ”) This ninety pages report is the result of an in depth study of UFOs, covering many aspects of the subject, especially questions of defense. The study was carried out during several y ears by an independent group of form er “auditors” at the very serious Institute of Higher Studies for National Defense, or IHEDN (“Institut des hautes Ètudes de défense nationale”), and of qualified experts from various fields. Before its public rel ease, it has been sent to French President of the Republic Jacques Chirac, and to Prim e Minister Lionel Jospin. This Report is prefaced by General Bernard Norlain, of the Air Force, form er Director of IHEDN, and it begins with a pream ble by André Le beau, form er President of the National Center for Space Studies (“Centre national d’ Ètudes spatial es”, CNES), the French equivalent of NASA. The group itself, collective author of the report, is an association of experts, m any of whom are or have been auditors of IHEDN, and it is preside d over by General Denis Letty , of the Air Force, form er auditor (FA) of IHEDN.

The com mittee also expresses its gratitude to outside contributors, am ong whom : Jean- Jacques Velasco, head of SEPRA at CNES, Franaois Louange, President of Flexim age, specialist of photo analy sis, General Joseph Dom ange, of the Ai r Force, general delegate of the Association of auditors at IHEDN. General Norlain tells in a short preface how this com mittee was created. General Letty cam e to see him in March 1995, when he was Director of IHEDN, to discuss his project of com mittee on UFOs. Norlain assured him of his interest and addressed him to the Association of Auditors (AA) of IHEDN, which in turn gave him its support. It is interesting to recall here that, twenty years ago, it was a report of that sam e Association which led to the creation of GEPAN, the first unit for UFO study , at CNES. As a result, several m embers of the com mittee com e from the Association of Auditors of IHEDN, joined by other experts. Most of th em hold, or have held, im portant functions in defense, industry , teaching, research, or various central adm inistrations. General Norlain expresses hope that this report will help develop new efforts nationally , and an indispensable international cooperation. General Letty , as president of COMETA, points to the m ain them e of the report, which is that the accum ulation of well docum ented observations com pels us now to consider all hy potheses as to the origin of UFOs, especially extraterrestrial hy potheses. The com mittee then presents the contents of the study : In a first part, presentation of som e rem arkable cases, both French and foreign. In a second part, they describe the present organization of r esearch in France and abroad, and studies m ade by scientists worldwide which m ay bring partial e xplanations, in accordance with known laws of phy sics. The main global explanations are then re viewed, from secret crafts to extraterrestrial manifestations. In a third part, will be exam ined m easures to be taken regarding defense, from inform ation of pilots, both civilian and m ilitary , to strategic, political and religious consequences, should the extraterrestrial hy pothesis be confirm ed. Part I: “Facts and Testimonies” Many of the cases selected are well known by m ost researchers, and need only to be mentioned here. They are: ¾ Testim onies of French pilots. M. Giraud, pilot of MirageIV (1977); Colonel Bosc, fighter pilot (1976); Air France flight AF 3532 (Jan 1994). ¾ Aeronautical cases worldwide. Lakenh eath (1956); RB-47 (1957); Teheran (1976); Russia (1990); San Carlos de Bariloche (Argentina, 1995). ¾ Observations from the ground. Tananarive (1954); observation of a saucer near the ground by a French pilot, J. -P. Fartek (1979); observation at close range over a Russian missile site, by several witnesses (1989). ¾ Close encounters in France. Valensole (Maurice Masse, 1965); Cussac, Cantal (1967); Trans-en-Provence (1981); Nancy (so-called case of the “Am aranth” 1982). ¾ Counter-exam ples of elucidated phenom ena (two cases). 426"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":" Although the selection is lim ited, it seem s to be sufficient to convince an uninform ed but open- minded reader of the reality of UFOs. Part II : “The Present State of Knowledge” The second part, entitled “the present state of knowledge” (“Le point des connaissances”), begins with a survey of the organization of th e official UFO research in France, from the first instructions given to the “gendarm erie” in 1974 fo r the redaction of reports, to the creation of GEPAN in 1977, its organization and its results: collection of m ore than 3,000 reports from the gendarm erie, cases studies, statistical analy ses. It then survey s agreem ents passed by GEPAN and, later, SEPRA, with the air force and the ar my, the civilian aviation and other organs, such as civilian and m ilitary laboratories for the analy sis of sam ples, and photographs. Regarding the methods and results, we ar e rem inded of som e fam ous cases (Trans-en- Provence, l’ Am arante), and em phasis is m ade on the catalogues of cases, notably of pilots (Weinstein catalogue), and “radar/visual”, world wide. A historical note appears here with a quotation of the fam ous letter of General Twin ing, of Septem ber 1947, asserting already to the reality of UFOs. The following chapter, called “hy potheses and attem pts at m odeling” (“OVNI : hy potheses, essais de m odélisation”) discusses som e m odels and hy potheses which are under study in several countries. Partial sim ulations have already been m ade for UFO propulsion, based on observations of aspects such as: speed, m ovem ents and accelerations, engine failure of nearby vehicles, paraly sis of witnesses. One m odel is MHD propulsion, already tested successfully in water, and which m ight be achieved in the atm osphere with superconducti ng circuits, in a few decades. Other studies are briefly m entioned, regarding both atm ospheric and space propulsion, such as particle beam s, antigravity , reliance on planetary and stellar im pulsion. The failure of land vehicle engines m ay be explained by microwave radiations. In fact, high power hy perfrequency generators are under study in France and other countries. One application is microwave weapons. Particle beam s, for instance proton beam s, which ionize the air and becom e therefore visible, might explain the observation of truncated lum inous beam s. Microwaves m ight explain body paraly sis. In the sam e chapter are next studied “gl obal hy potheses”. Hoaxes are rare and easily detected. Som e non-scientific are put aside, such as conspiracies and manipulation by very secret, powerful groups, parapsy chic phenom ena, collectiv e hallucinations. The hy pothesis of secret weapons is also regarded as very im probable, the sam e as “intoxication” at the tim e of the cold war, or just natural phenom ena. We are then le ft with various extraterrestrial hy potheses. One version has been developed in France by astr onom ers Jean-Claude Ribes and Guy Monnet, based on the concept of “space islands” of Am erican phy sicist O’ Neill, and it is com patible with present day phy sics. The organization of UFO research in the United States, Great Britain and Russia is survey ed rapidly . In the United States, the m edia and the polls show a m arked interest and concern of the public, but the official position, especially of the Air Force, is still one of denial, more precisely that there is no threat to national security . Ac tually , declassified docum ents, released under FOIA, show another story , one of surveillance of nuclear installations by UFOs, and the continued study of UFOs by the m ilitary and intelligence agencies. 427"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":" The report stresses the im portance, in the United States, of private, independent associations. It m entions the “Briefing Docum ent. Best available evidence” sent in 1995 to a thousand personalities worldwide, and the Sturrock wo rkshop in 1997, both sponsored by Laurance Rockefeller. The “Briefing Docum ent” has obvious ly been welcom ed by the authors of the COMETA report. The com mittee also notes the pub lic em ergence of alleged insiders such as Colonel Philip Corso, and considers that his testim ony m ay be partly significant as to the real situation in that country , in spite of m any critics. The report describes briefly the situation in Gr eat Britain, with a special m ention for Nick Pope, and poses the question of the possible exis tence of secret studies pursued jointly with Am erican services. It m entions as well research in Russia, and the release of som e inform ation, notably by the KGB in 1991. Part III: UFOs and Defense The third part, “UFOs and Defense” (“Les OVNI et la defense”), states that, if it is true that no hostile action has been proved y et, at least som e actions of “intim idation” have been recorded in France (case of the Mirage IV for instance). Si nce the extraterrestrial origin of UFOs cannot be ruled out, it is therefore necessary to study the consequences of that hy pothesis at the strategic level, but also political, religious and m edia/public inform ation levels. The first chapter of Part III is devoted to pr ospective strategies (“Prospectives strategiques”) and it begins with fundam ental questions: “What if extraterrestrials? What intentions and what strategy can we deduce from their behavior?” Such questions open a m ore controversial pa rt of the report. Possible m otivations of extraterrestrial visitors are explored here, such as protection of planet Earth against the dangers of nuclear war, suggested for instance by repeated fly ing over nuclear m issile sites. The com mittee then ponders the possible repercussion on the behavior, official or not, of different states, and focuses on the possibility of secret, privileged contacts which might be “attributed to the United States”. The attitude of the U.S. is seen as “m ost strange” since the 1947 wave and the Roswell event. Since that tim e, a policy of increasing secrecy seem s to have been applied, which m ight be explained by the protection at all cost of m ilitary technological superiority to be acquired from the study of UFOs. Next, the report tackles the question: “What m easures m ust we take now? ” At the least, whatever the nature of UFOs, they im pose “critical vigilance”, in particular regarding the risk of “destabilizing manipulations”. A kind of “cosm ic vigilance” should be applied by the elites, nationally and internationally , in order to preven t any shocking surprise, erroneous interpretation and hostile m anipulation. Nationally , COMETA urges the strengthening of SEPRA, and recom mends the creation of a cell at the highest level of governm ent, entruste d with the developm ent of hy potheses, strategy , and preparation of cooperation agreem ents with European and other foreign countries. A further step would be that European states and the Eu ropean Union undertake diplom atic action toward the Unites States within the fram ework of political and strategic alliances. A key question of the report is “What situations must we be prepared for? ” It m entions such situations as: extraterrestrial move for official contact; discovery of a UFO/alien base on the 428"},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":" territory or in Europe; invasion (deem ed im probable) and localized or m assive attack; manipulation or deliberate disinform ation aim ing at destabilizing other states. COMETA devotes special attention to “aerona utical im plications,” with detailed recom mendations aim ed at various personnel, such as air staffs, controllers, weatherm en and engineers. It also makes recom mendations at the scientific and technical levels, aim ed at developing research, with potential be nefits for defense and industry . The report further explores the political and relig ious im plications of UFOs, using as a m odel the perspective of our own exploration of sp ace: how would we do it, how would we handle contacts with less advanced civilizations? Such an approach is not new to the well- inform ed readers of the abundant ufological literature, but it has a special value here, bei ng treated seriously at such a level. The media/publicity im plications are not forgotten, with the problem s of disinform ation, fear of ridicule, and m anipulation by certain groups. In its conclusion, COMETA claim s that the phy sical reality of UFOs, under control of intelligent beings, is “quasi certain”. Only one hy pothesis takes into account the available data: the hy pothesis of extraterrestrial visitors. This hy pothesis is of course unproved, but has far- reaching consequences. The goals of these alle ged visitors rem ain unknown but m ust be the subject of speculations and prospective scenarios. In its final recom mendations, it stresses again the need to: 1. Inform all decision-m akers and persons in position of responsibility ; 2. Reinforce m eans of investigation and study at SEPRA; 3. Have UFO detection taken into account by agencies engaged in of space surveillance; 4. Create a strategic cell at the highest state level; 5. Undertake diplom atic action toward th e Unites States for cooperation on this “capital question”; 6. Study m easures which m ight be necessary in case of em ergencies. Finally , this docum ent is accom panied by seven interesting annexes which are worth reading even by seasoned ufologists: 1. Radar detection in France 2. Observations by astronom ers 3. Life in the Universe 4. Colonization of space 5. The Roswell case - The disinform ation (an interesting text which will be criticized by som e readers, and welcom ed by others, including m yself) 6. Antiquity of the UFO phenom enon. Elem ents for a chronology 7. Reflection on various psy chological, sociological and political aspects of the UFO phenom enon. The im portance of this report should not be m issed by all inform ed ufologists around the world, considering not only its contents but the personality of its authors, and in spite of critics which may be addressed to it. In fact, som e shar p critics have been m ade soon after the release of the report, on the Internet, and in the French press with an article by sociologist Pierre Lagrange curiously denouncing an operation of disinform ation by way of ridiculing the subject (“Libération 429"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":" of July 21, 1999). Let’ s hope that the present sum mary will help clarify the debate. Gildas Bourdais 9.0 APPENDIX AI. UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS RELATED TO UFOs 9.1 Summary Review of Government Documents The docum ents included here in Appendix I are only those referenced in the text of this docum ent and were selected to: 1) specifically support sightings reports or 2) support specific points in the discussion. Many im portant US Governm ent UFO docum ents that we have collected (well over 1000 pages) are not in this briefing sum mary since including all such docum ents would have been im practical. Web sites such as that run by the Black Vault 116 have available m any thousands of pages of governm ent docum ents relating to UFO issues (m ostly obtained from the governm ent through FOIA , the Freedom of Inform ation Act 117 ). Although many of the docum ents m ay be difficult to read, the sharp-ey ed reader will quickly realize the extent of the governm ent’s and the m ilitary ’s deep interest and involvem ent in UFO issues. Not only is their continued interest obvious, but also their continued desire to keep the inform ation from the public through a com bination of secrecy , and deliberate m isinform ation and disinform ation (this process was discussed in the position paper entitled: “Unacknowledged”). It should be noted that for nearly every reported observation, there are a slew of pronouncem ents by “experts” and officials dism issing the observation. However, all these statem ents are basically invalidated by a single phenom enon: the continued action of our governm ent to classify docum ents such as those in the appendices, as secret, and to m aintain that secrecy up to and in som e cases in the face of the unprecedented power of the Freedom of Inform ation Act. If there were nothing to th ese sightings, there would be no need for secrecy ! An excellent exam ple of governm ent agency duplicity about their interest in UFOs is described by John Greenewald on the BlackVault web site 118 in which he quotes the following Air Force standard position statem ent, quoted from a letter he received from the Air Force: Regarding UFO/UAO phenom enon, we have no doc um entation, archived or otherwise, regarding this ty pe phenom enon and have not docum ented this ty pe of inform ation or maintained a database on sam e since the o fficial closing of “Project Blue Book 119 ” in 1969. From the evidence gathered here we know that th e Air Force did have interest in UFOs prior to the closing of “Project Blue Book” since Air Force Regulation AFR 200-2 120 (1954) describes   116 Web site at: http://www.blackvault.com 117 FOIA-Freedom of Information Act.

Note that the position statem ent above im plies there is no present interest in UFOs. However, the present Air Force Manual on Operational Reporting (AFM AN 10-206), dated March 7, 2000, describes CIRVIS (Com munications Instructions for Reporting Vital Intelligence Sightings) reporting procedures which in section 5.7.3.3 specify “Unidentified Fly ing Objects,” which are listed separately from unidentified aircraft (section 5.7. 3.1). These reports are to be subm itted to the Com mander in Chief at NORAD Headquarters. Docum ents from the m id-1970s discussed in the section (6.7) on Air Com mand Base overflights show the intense interest at NORAD in the UFO phenom enon at that tim e, which appears to continue to this day . 9.2 Appendix I.1: List of Descriptions of Government Documents Related to UFOs AI.1.

I would lik e to thank the thousands of CSETI supporters around the world for their help, networking and de dication, without which this project could never have been created and fulfilled. I especially wish to thank m y wife Em ily and our four daughters for their love, dedication and support for these many years. Em ily has worked tirelessly behind the scenes for y ears and alway s in the most self-effacing and pure-hearted way . There is just no one like her on this planet. Thank y ou, thank y ou. My fam ily has also sacrificed in m any other way s – They have foregone several m illion dollars in incom e while I have been doing this work and th ey have, in m any way s, sacrificed the m ost. I started this project, not them . How m any doctor’ s wives would patiently support such an effort? But knowing what the stakes are for hum anity , how could we do otherwise? Without the unconditional love and support of m y fam ily this undertaking could not have even been contem plated. The list that follows can only be a partial one. It reflects the hard work and dedication of so m any and we are indebted to them all. Special thanks go to all of the m ilitary and governm ent witnesses and to m y chief assistants, Linda Willitts on the west coast and Debbie Foch in the DC area. 490"},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":" Shari Adam iak ARS NOVA Major-General Vasily Alexeyev Eric Anderson Lt.
