The underlying implication is that since UFOs presumably don't crash, they must not be real. The study of thousands of reports from ex cellent observers (airline pilots, military pilots) of close-range, da ylight observa- tions of apparently manufactu red craft whose shapes and performance defy even the latest of scientific theories cer- tainly supports the contention th at some of the things re- ported as UFOs are almost ce rtainly real—and completely unexplained. The lack of solid evidence th at even one had crashed had bothered serious students of the subject for decades. It was hard to imagine that any constructed devices could be so flawless that they never failed. And w ithout something more than an untraceable rumor of a crash, it wa s difficult to make much of a case for UFO reality, let alone alien origin. The need for an improved, updated, more understandable and more readable b ook to follow the 1980 Roswell Incident by Bill Moore and Charles Berlitz had been on the mind of lecturer/researcher Stanton Fr iedman for many years. Having done much of the investigating for that book, he continued to dig into the crash near Corona , New Mexico. (Nothing crashed at Roswell, despite the titles of books; it was just the largest city within seventy-five miles of the crash site.)

A plan to co-write a follow- up book with Bill Moore came to naught, but the idea and the pressing need remained. Steadily, the information and the confirma tions of earlier information were piling up, and so any subsequent book would undoubt- edly be stronger and more c onvincing. Through the 1980s, however, Friedman's on ly outlet for the stor y he was gathering through hundreds of phone calls monthly and thousands of miles of travel were formal papers (some written with Moore) published privately or presen ted at MUFON (Mutual UFO Network) annual conferences. In the summer of 198 9, he persuaded th e producers of the NBC-TV series Unsolved Mysteries to do a major investigative segment on the Corona crash and served as a technical adviser to the show, which led off th e 1989 fall season. The intense audience reaction to the original airing in September 1989 and to the rerun in January 1990 su rprised everyone but Friedman. Scores of viewers called a special telephone numb er to record their involvement (direct, indir ect, through hearsay, or imagin- ary) in some aspect of the my sterious events in New Mexico. This produced quite a few intere sting leads, wh ich in turn revealed a few previ ously unsuspected sour ces of valuable in- formation. This was especially true of the le sser-known crash at the Plains of San Agustin, where a firstha nd witness came forward. In 1989, Friedman proposed a book about the ne w evidence for the Corona and San Agustin crashes to literary agent John White. At about the same time , aviation/science writer Don Berliner offered a similar idea to White, who had previously found him a publisher for an aviation book. White brought them together and suggested they collaborate, with Friedman concentrating on the investigat ion and Berliner on the writing. The two had already worked together when Friedman's pro- posed investigation of the hi ghly controversial Majestic-12 documents was financed in 1988 by the Fund for UFO Re- search, on whose execu tive committee Berliner sat. They had"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"P REFACE xi long been acquainted and each considered the other to be among the small group in the private UFO community whose work could be counted upon. In mid-1990, following a private conference of crash witnesses spon sored by the fund, a contract was signed and research and writing accelerated. The search for proof of the cras h of even one UFO has been a long string of frustrat ions punctuated by the occasional joyful discovery of a witness whose story checked out and whose background was solid. But most l eads turned out to be nothing or simply couldn't be checked out at all. One woman who claimed her father had been a military doctor who performed an autopsy on an alien body was re vealed to have a disturbingly active imagination, according to members of her family. Friedman was determined to follow a strict scientific method, so he began the pain staking search through volumi- nous records, and files, and ol d newspapers. Other UFO investi- gators had grabbed vague ru mors and built them into wonderfully detailed stories that had no basis in fact. Still others had apparently invented tales to satisfy the insatiable hunger of the press and the public for answers to questions that remain unanswered. Each such episode, whether exposed by members of the private UFO community or by extremists in the anti-UFO clique, hurt those who were pa tiently sifting a mountain of sand in hope of finding a flake of gold. But enough shiny specks were found to keep th e serious searchers sifting ever more sand in the hope of finding the mother lode . And even though some carefully planted \"fool's gold\" turned up, the real stuff was there, too. Not th e absolute pr oof that everyone wanted— demanded—but an encouraging co llection of intriguing bits. One of the major ha ndicaps Friedman faced was the antiq- uity of the event. Those who had held important positions when the crashes occurred—gen erals, legislators, cabinet members, scientists—w ere, with rare ex ceptions, long dead. All the people who had known more than a small portion of the huge story were gone, and their me moirs were either classified or had been carefully cleansed of anything that might hint at"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"xii P REFACE involvement. Those who remained were the bit players, people who had seen or heard just a little. Another major ha ndicap was the brilliant covering-up by the entire American government, qu ite possibly with the coopera- tion of other governments, incl uding the disgracefully clever trick of creating an atmosphere in which anyone showing more than a casual interest in UFOs was made to lo ok like a fool. And while this made investigatio n far more difficult than it should have been, it had the unintended positive effect of revealing the crashes to have be en real events. Otherwise, why would the government have gone to such lengths to make them appear imaginary? The proof is out there, somewh ere. If at least two men in- volved in the packing and tran sporting of wreckage are known to have taken souvenirs, one ca n assume that others helped themselves to small pieces of unknown material that might someday acquire great value. Some of the material has proba- bly been thrown away by relative s unaware of its true nature. Some of it, though, probably re mains hidden away in attic trunks and little boxes and mayb e even between the pages of unread books on a shelf. There are rumors that one or more of the archeology stu- dents who stumbled upon the Pl ains of San Agustin crash pocketed bits of mate rial and later buried them in a cave. Or that a young man who lived near the Corona site picked up pieces over a period of months or years and hid them in a coffee can he kept in his private little cave. And then there is all the ma terial, including bodies, recov- ered by the government. One shudders to think that any of it has been disposed of, and so it must be hidden somewhere. More than one person must know the details: where, by whom, and especially why.... This book is certain ly not the end. It is merely the most recent step in the complex, frust rating, fascinating search for witnesses and evidence of one of the most amazing events in world history. The search will continue until the facts have been made public."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" OR A FEW HOURS on July 8, 1947, the lid was off and it was possible to take a peek inside the mystery. The lid was then slammed back down so firmly and so authoritatively that nearly everyone soon forgot it had ever been off. The completely un expected development came from the Public Information Office at th e Roswell Army Air Field in southeastern New Mexico. The pr ess release, distributed by public information offi cer 1st Lt. Walter Haut on the direct orders of base commander Co l. William Blanchard, was a shocker: The many rumors regarding the fl ying disc became a reality yesterday when the Intelligence office of the 509t h Bomb Group of the Eighth Air Force, Roswell Army Air Field, was fortunate enough to gain posse ssion of a disc thro ugh the cooperation of one of the local ranchers and the sheriff's office of Chaves County. The flying object landed on a ranch near Rosw ell sometime last week. Not having phone facilities, the rancher stored the disc until such time as he was able to contact the sheriff's office, who in turn notified Maj. Jesse A. Marcel of the 509th Bomb Group Intelligence Office. Action was immediately taken and the disc was picked up at the rancher's home. It was insp ected at the Roswell Army Air Field and subsequently loaned by Major Marcel to higher head- quarters. The news shot out over the te letype wires to every news- paper and radio station in the country. After two weeks of xiii F"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"xiv I NTRODUCTION vague reports of unbelievable sights in the sky, here at last was something tangible. No t that any hard-nos ed reporter took the preposterous story at face value, but at least it was more than the usual claim by some housewife that she had seen an alumi- num disc fly over her backyard. Questions poured into Army Air Forces information offices from Roswell to Washington, and a lot of men in unifo rm ran around in circles. About three hours after the stor y went out, it was canceled and replaced by another, quite different one: The wonderful \"flying disc\" was nothing more than the radar reflector from a wandering weather ball oon that had somehow been misiden- tified by the first people to see it . There were sigh s of relief in offices in the Pentagon as well as in newsrooms where veteran journalists had been trying to deal with some news that didn't fit the established pattern. U.S. Eighth Air Force headquart ers at Fort Worth, Texas, then became the center of activi ty. Pieces of the remains of whatever-it-was were flown th ere from Roswell in a B-29 Superfortress, one of the airpla nes operated by the 5O9th Bomb Group, which was the sole unit in the world equipped to deliver atomic weapons. It had been th e B-29s of the 509th that had dropped A-bombs on Hi roshima and Nagasaki. Major Marcel flew to Fort Worth with the wreckage he had helped recover from the ranch cr ash site, and it was shown to Eighth Air Force commander Brig. Gen. Roger Ramey. He had a small quantity of it placed in an office and permitted press photographers to take pictures from a dist ance, while forbid- ding them to get close enough to touch it. The office was closed briefly, then reopened so that the press could see wreckage close-up and even handle it. Warrant Officer Irving Newton wa s called in from his post as base weather officer and promptly identified the wreckage as a radar reflector from a weather balloon known as a rawinsonde. It was used to determine the speed and direction of high- altitude winds and was a standard piece of equipment in those days.

The press reported all of this and unanimously concluded th at it had all be en a mistake, that a balloon had been misi dentified as a flying disc. According to the July 9 Washington Post \"[Rancher William] Brazel found the broken remains of the weather device scat- tered over a square mile of hi s land.... He bundled the tinfoil and broken wooden beams on the k ite and the torn synthetic rubber remains of the balloon together and rolled it under some brush....\" As far as the press and the public were c oncerned, that was the end of the tale of the cr ashed \"flying saucer.\" No one thought to questi on why something so commonplace as a weather balloon had caused so much commotion. Or how two officers of an elite AAF unit co uld possibly have failed to recognize it. Or how this smal l, flimsy contraption, which could hardly have come to earth violently, could have strewn its pieces over \"a squa re mile\" of sheep ranch. Had these questions b een asked, the act of slamming the lid closed might not have been so effective. Bu t they weren't, and the flying saucer wave of 1947 wa s allowed to die out. For more than two weeks, the papers and news broa dcasts had been full of fascinating, fancif ul-sounding stories of peculiar flying ob- jects, and nothing had come of it.

At the end of the nineteenth century, with ballooning a popular sport and powered ballo ons—airships—being tested in hopes of providing elementary air transportation, a wave of sightings of \"mystery airships\" broke out. While many of the reports were eventually blam ed on publicity-seekers and un- ethical journalists, some reports suggested real machines with performance capabilities greater than anything known to have been flying at the time. But not until man entered the age of mechanical flight with the first voyages by th e Wright Brothers in 1903 could reports of odd aerial sights be judged in the light of rapidly advancing technology. It wasn't until 1911-19 12 that airplanes began to be seen in any numbers, and th en mainly at air shows where there were people ready to pay for the privilege. This was soon followed by the first of the twentieth-century waves of UFOlike sights. Called \"mystery airplanes,\" they are only now beginning to attract serious attention. Similar waves of mystery airplanes that failed to conform to known activity were reported from both the United States and Europe in the 1930s, but not until the latter stages of World War II did the press and governments began to pay attention to a cohesive phenomenon: the \"foo fighters.\" These mysterious, often \"playful \" balls of light and shining spheres were reported by the e xperienced crews of American warplanes in both the European and Pacific theaters of war in late 1944 and early 1945 . They were said to fly along with our planes and even to play tag with them, singly and in small formations. Not once was ther e any suggestion that a foo fighter had proved aggressive or even mildly unfriendly. That, in the midst of history's most te rrible war, suggested two possi- ble explanations: they were so mething natural (such as St. Elmo's Fire, the eerie atmospheri c discharge of built-up static electricity) or they were insidious enemy machines not quite ready for combat. After all, th e sky was full of V-l buzz bombs and V-2 rockets; who could say what other devilish contrap- tions the Nazis mi ght be readying?"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"A H ISTORY OF M ODERN S IGHTINGS 3 So many reports of foo-fighter si ghtings were filed with Army Air Forces Intelligence that higher headquarters had little choice but to take them seriously . The Eighth Air Force, based in England and commanded by fame d test and racing pilot Jimmy Doolittle, had a study made of the foo fighters. While no copy has yet come to light, it allegedly concluded that some of them might be experimental German or Japanese w eapons that had not reached operational status, wh ile others must be misin- terpretations of ordinary sights. (After the war, it was reported that captured enemy documents showed that the Germans and Japanese had been aware of the foo fighters but had concluded the mysterious things we re probably Allied weapons!) Based on what little is known about the episode, about all that can be said with any conf idence is that the foo fighters were a wartime idiosyncrasy. Once reports of their sighting ceased to be made, it was easy for everyone to forget about them. The war was over and ther e were more important mat- ters occupying people's minds. Then, in the summer of 1946, odd sky sigh ts resumed, this time over the Scandinavian countries. They were soon nicknamed \"Swedish ghost rocket s\" since many of them were said to be long and thin, like ro ckets. Scores of reports were published in newspapers throughout the region, and soon the Swedish Defense Staff establis hed a secret commission to gather and study the reports. Most people in and out of govern- ment suspected they were Soviet devices built with the help of captured Nazi scientists a nd launched from Peenemunde, the legendary German test base located less than a hundred miles across the Baltic from Sweden. Detailed information was hard to find, and when the Swed- ish government clampe d down on all publicity (one day after former USAAF general Jimmy Doolittle and former Eisenhower aide Gen. David Sarnoff had me t with high Swed- ish officials), it became almost im possible to find out what was happening. Only in the late 1980s, when secrecy was finally relaxed, did it become apparent that the ghost rockets could not possibly have been Soviet mi ssiles and therefore have to be considered proto-UFOs."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"4 C RASH AT C ORONA In 1946, however, little was known about the nature and origins of the ghost ro ckets, and so the few who thought seri- ously about them assumed ther e was some connection with presumed Soviet rocket or missi le experiments, even though the rocket-shaped UFOs usually flew level like airplanes and made little or no noise. Historians agree that no such tests ever took place at Peenemunde, and to have made an y would have recklessly endangered secrecy as we ll as relations with a tradi- tionally neutral neighbor. But lo gic does not appear to have played a major role in the pub lic's perception of the story. The ghost rockets, which eventual ly were seen as far south as Greece, faded away at the end of 1946, just another peculiar interlude. But strange sky sighti ngs did not. They were re- ported into the spring of 1947, but very quietly, as the fear of ridicule carried more weight than did the need to make news or record potentially important information. The slowly simmering pot suddenly boiled over on June 24, 1947, with the historic experien ce of a veteran mountain pilot in Washington State. Pilot a nd businessman Kenneth Arnold was helping in the hunt for a lo st military transport plane in the vicinity of 14,410-foot Mount Rainier when his attention was captured by the brilliant g lint from something in the dis- tance. He forgot the search and concentrated on what now appeared as a formation of nine roundish craft, fl ying in a line and snaking around a series of mountain peak s Arnold knew well from previous flights. Their speed amazed him, so he used the sweep second hand of the clock on his instrument panel to determ ine that they had covered the 48 miles betw een Mount Rainier and Mount Adams in 1 minute, 42 second s, which works out to 1,700 mph! At the time, the world speed record for airplanes was only 624 mph; it wouldn't approach 1700 mph for another fifteen years. There were a few experi mental and research airplanes capable of flying fast er than the official record, but they never flew in formation. Arnold described the flying moti on of the objects as resem- bling that of saucers skipping acr oss the water; this was picked"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"A H ISTORY OF M ODERN S IGHTINGS 5 up by the press and quickly distorted into \"flying saucers.\" The experienced pilot's report of a group of objects having uncon- ventional shape, unconventiona l flying characteristics, and startling speed attracted the immediate attention of the country—including, one can reasonably assume, the U.S. Army Air Forces. This report was soon joined by hundreds of others of \"flying saucers\" or \"flying discs,\" trav eling singly or in formations, from every state. Many came from highly qua lified observers, such as the pilot and co-pilot of a United Airlines DC-4 and several officers at the secret Ar my Air Forces test base of Muroc Field, California (later renamed Edwards Air Force Base). The high-water mark of th is first American wave of UFO sightings came on the July Four th weekend, when several hun- dred sightings were recorded in a few days, continuing at a high rate even after the holiday, al though most Americans had re- turned to work. The saucers were said to have flown at high speeds and at low speeds, at high and at low a ltitudes. They flew silently and sometimes with soft whirring or buzzing sounds. But one thing no one reported seeing them do was come into contact with the land, either intentionally as if landing, or unintentionally as when crashing. Newspapers and radio broadcasts were full of stories about the mysterious flying discs, along with a long list of explana- tions from scientists who should have know n better and ordi- nary people who couldn't be expe cted to know wh at they were talking about. They must be airp lanes, or balloons, or ice crys- tals, or hailstones that had somehow become flattened (no one ever explained how) so they woul d skim across the sky and give the impression of flying. They might be the gl owing tailpipes of jets. They were spots before the eyes. They were optical illu- sions. Or they were simply the figments of wild imagination. One thing was obvious: They couldn't possibly be what people were describi ng! There were no r ound flying machines, or disc-shaped ones. There wasn 't anything that could streak along at 1,700 mph within th e atmosphere wi thout making"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"6 C RASH AT C ORONA noise. All of this added up to either something outlandish or something imaginary. For several weeks the saucers and the stories about them flew around the country and al most everyone laughed. Espe- cially news commentators and car toonists, who had a field day with flying saucers and flying soupbowls and other forms of aerial crockery. Then it ended. The saucers stopped flying. Whatever they were, they hadn' t really done anything. They hadn't hurt anyone or dented any fenders or squashed anyone's geraniums. It was almost as if they hadn't been here in the first place. And if they hadn't made any detectable impact on Amer- ican life, perhaps they were no more than a new form of mass hysteria, similar to that wh ich resulted from Orson Welles' 1938 War of the Worlds radio program. Real things make their presence known in more than fanci- ful tales. They are recognized by expe rts. They produce changes. But the \"flying saucer s\" hadn't resulted in a single show of concern from any scientist. The government—mainly the U.S. Army Air Forces—said they were not American exper- imental airplanes or rockets. The press was nearly unani- mously flippant in its treatme nt of the phenomenon. Who can pay attention to a fe w casual bystanders when the people who should know and who should be concerned haven't shown a hint of interest? By all indications, the great \"f lying saucer\" s care of 1947 came and went in a few weeks, leaving behind nothing more tangible than memories. Funny memories and puzzling memo- ries, to be sure. But just memories. The argument against their exis tence as anything real and solid seemed pretty obvious: If flying saucers were real and were flying over the United States with regularity, then there should be the occasional cras h. All known manmade vehicles crash, and in 1947 the flying sa ucers were assumed to be man- made, if indeed they were anythi ng at all.

This wasn't the first crashed-sa ucer tale Friedman had heard in his eleven years of lecturing and listening. As a matter of fact, there had been several of them, but none had turned out to lead to any valuable evidence. In 1978 claims of the recovery of crashed saucers bordered on th e disreputable, so Friedman parked this one in his memory and went on to the university to deliver his lecture, one of hundr eds he gave to college groups in the 1970s. \"The very next day,\" Friedman recalled, \"while at an airport on [the way] to my ne xt lecture, I called Information, got a number for a Jesse Marc el in Houma, Louisi ana, and gave him a call.\" The lead obviously hadn't slipped very far back in his mind, and came back to the su rface because there was some- thing special about it. \"[Marcel] sounded st raightforward.

Marcel described the material to Friedman ov er the phone, giving the veteran UFO investigat or the first indication of the nature of what could possibly tu rn out to be the most impor- tant discovery of the mille nnium. The area covered with wreckage was roughly three quarters of a mile long and several hundred yards wide. The material Marcel and Cavitt saw was nothing but unusual and thoroughl y unrecognizable. Much of it was foil-like: as thin as the foil in a pack of cigarettes, just as light, and yet extremely strong. There were short lengths of I beam with odd symbols along th e web. There was other ma- terial that somewh at resembled parchm ent—heavy paper— and, like the foil an d the beams, was extremely light and strong. Neither experienced airm an had ever seen anything remotely like any of this. \"[Marcel]\" Friedman conti nued, \"was checking around for an indication of a crater or [oth er disturbance in the terrain], \"There wasn't one. It seemed to him that it must have exploded in the air. They gathered up a bun ch of this stuff in an army Jeep Carry-All and an old Buick staff car and brought it back to town. The next day Marcel was in structed by Col. Blanchard, commanding officer of the air ba se, to put the stuff in a B-29 and fly it to Wright Field, Ohio (site of the Army Air Forces scientific and technical laborat ories, where unfamiliar mate- rials could be studied by experts) . A stop was scheduled in Fort Worth, Texas, at the headquarter s of the Eighth Air Force, of which they were a part. \"When they got to Texas, Brig . Gen. Roger Ramey, who was head of the Eighth Air Force, told him not to say anything."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"T HE S EARCH FOR E VIDENCE B EGINS 11 Marcel wouldn't, being under orders. And General Ramey told the press it was just a radar re flector from a weather balloon. Just junk. Marcel said, 'I couldn 't say anything. It sure wasn't part of a weather balloon; I knew that. But I didn't know what it was. We came back to Roswell. My picture was in the papers all over the place,' he added, 'and I still don't know what it was!' \" Friedman asked Jesse Marcel a few questions and then tucked it all away in that special place re served for fascinating leads that lack any hope for veri fication. He had tracked stories of crashed saucers before, like the one about a dozen alien bodies hidden away in the pr obably-mythical Hangar 18 at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base—t he same Wright Field, since renamed, to which the Roswell material reporte dly had been flown. All the stories seemed to end the same way, with the main source saying something on the order of \"Somebody told me the story, but you can't use his name. No, you can't talk to him. There's no way to verify it, and so you'll just have to take it at face value.\" That sort of information is worthless until there is something or someone to back it up. One person's testimony simply isn't sufficient to make such a report worth more than scribbled notes. And so Friedman found it hard to get very excited when he heard Marcel's story, even though it and Marcel sounded straight. There was no date, not even an approximate one, attached to the report. And Friedman was busy tracking down a lot of other seemingly more promising leads. But this tale, weak as it seemed , kept gnawing away at Fried- man. There was something about crash and New Mexico that added up to more than just three words. Maybe it was because New Mexico, after World War II, was the scene of so much secret work that might be of interest to those of unknown origin and purpose. There was the vast White Sands proving ground, where the U.S. Army wa s launching captured German V-2 rockets in the first phase of what would become the great American space program. And th ere was Trinity Site, where the world's first nuclear device was set off, and Los Alamos, where the A-bomb was created in amazing secrecy during the"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"12 C RASH AT C ORONA war and where far more powerfu l weapons were being devel- oped. Friedman had vi sited Los Alamos while working on the nuclear rocket program a decade earlier and had noted the huge selection of UFO-related material s in the lab's library. Or per- haps it was other places in th e state where so much work was being done on advanced types of radar and who-knows-what- else. Altogether, it added up to the relatively centralized location of the nation's, indeed the worl d's most advanced technology, all of which was aime d at creating weapons of enormous de- structive power and th e capacity for interpla netary flight. Cer- tainly all of this would be of great interest to whoever was flying around in disc-sha ped craft, be they Russians or aliens. Way back in Stanton Friedman's mind there were a few little clicks, including another lead he had picked up a few years before that might be connected with Marcel's story. It had come about when he was work ing on a series of magazine articles with West Coast write r Bobbi Slate Gironda. She had heard an interesting UFO anecdote from a Southern California forest ranger named Sleppy. \"The person you really ought to talk to is my mother, Ly dia Sleppy,\" he told her. Together they located Lydia, who told them a story of having been in New Mexico, working at an Albuquerque radio station. One of the people at their Rosw ell affiliate called up and told her to put a story on the teletype wire about the recovery of a crashed flying saucer that was be ing sent to Wrig ht Field. He dictated the story and she st arted to send it out when her transmission was interrupted. Apparently the FBI was moni- toring those lines, which was no su rprise in view of all the classified work then going on in New Mexico. They told her: \"Do not complete this transmission.\" And she did as she was told, for people in that part of the country were very security- conscious even if they didn 't work for the government. Sometime later, when Mrs. Slep py talked to the man who had dictated the story to her, he clammed up completely and refused to say anything more about it. This was a puzzling story, to be sure, though not much more so than a lot of other"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"T HE S EARCH FOR E VIDENCE B EGINS 13 rumors in the flying saucer m ill that usually dissolved upon close inspection. Still, this on e included the names of some of the people she had work ed with, the sort of specific informa- tion consistently and conspicuou sly absent from most other stories. Friedman tracked down some of the names, which required considerable effort because of the years that had passed since the event, but he soon found hi mself stonewalled. There was no place to go. One person wouldn 't talk at all (intriguingly suspicious, but hardly proof of anything), while another had no additional leads and only vaguely remembered the incident. Was this just another of the ma ny stories that start out sound- ing so good and end up hanging in midair? Still, the Jesse Marcel anecdote could turn out to be both true and important. If the major was who he clai med to be, he could have been in a position to know what happened (assum- ing, of course, that something actually happened). But was he who he claimed to be, or did he have an unfortunately active imagination? And even if he wa s legitimate, did his story have any connection with that of Lydi a Sleppy? Did they even hap- pen in the same year? Could it all be a mistake or garbled information? Those and many more doubts cl ouded the issue and kept Friedman from assuming he was finally onto the trail. Until some of the doubts were cleared up, it wouldn't be anything to write home about. Marcel's st ory certainly sounded exciting and important, but Friedman ha d no reason to connect it with anything else, because it lacked so much as an approximate date. It was filed aw ay, but with a gold st ar so it could be retrieved on short notice, should the need arise. Later that year, on October 24, 1978, Friedman gave a lecture at Bemidji (Minnesota) State Un iversity and was approached cautiously by a couple who had left the hall at the end of his talk and then decided to return. They asked, after most of the crowd had departed, if he had ever heard of a saucer that crashed in New Mexi co ... with alien bodies. \"I've heard rumors about such stories.\" he responded. \"Tell me more.\" It"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"14 C RASH AT C ORONA was one of several stock replies pr epared for hints of odd events that frequently came to light in the open atmosphere of a well- attended UFO lecture. Vern and Jean Maltais told hi m briefly that a very good friend of theirs, \"Barney\" Barnett, had related a story of seeing a crashed saucer with alien bodies down in New Mexico in the late forties. They too were una ble to pin down a specific year, let alone a month or day. But th ey stressed that Barnett, an engineer working for the govern ment, was a well-respected individual. They had no reason to think he was telling them anything other than the truth, despite the bizarre content of the story. Crashed saucers are one thing, and c ould well turn out to be futuristic American or even foreign ai rcraft or mis- siles. But alien bodies are anothe r matter entirely, and hardly subject to misinterpret ation. Bodies are ei ther people or they are not. The Maltais had kept in touch wi th Barnett for several years, though he was dead now. They thought Friedman might be interested in the story, and they were right. Pieces, as yet completely unconnected , were starting to pile up. He took their names and the next day, wh en he ran into William Moore, a local high school teacher whos e interest in UFOs he had known about for years, he sugg ested that Moor e start looking into the Maltais/Barnett story.

Here was another piece of some puzzle (or possibly of several di fferent puzzles), but so far the pieces were small, vague, and wi dely scattered. They formed nothing approaching a coherent sh ape. But even these few bits of data were an improvement on all previous stories of crashed saucers. Then, on February 10, 1979 , while Moore was rooting through the newspaper files in th e main library of the Univer- sity of Minnesota, he came acr oss several clip pings describing much the same thing Jesse Marcel had outlined to Stan Fried- man a year earlier. It was th e breakthrough they had been looking for. Jesse Marcel apparently was exactly who he claimed to be, and as such was an important cog in a machine whose bare outline was just starting to take form. He had indeed been in the right place at the right time to become aware of the crash and the wreckage and the return of the mysterious material to Roswell Army Air Field. The one -time intelligence officer of an elite Army Air For ces unit was exactly th e sort of firsthand witness who could propel the stor y of the crash into the history books. After more than thirty y ears the fortress of official secrecy had developed its first crack. The clippings opened up all so rts of opportunities for addi- tional investigation. The name of the rancher on whose prop- erty the thing had crashed was there: William \"Mac\" Brazel. There were several important military people, including Eighth Air Force commander Brig. Gen. Roger Ramey; his chief of staff, Col. Thomas Jeffers on DuBose; Roswell base com- mander Col. William Blanchard, an d public information officer 1st Lt. Walter Haut —who had issued th e puzzling announce- ment about the recovery of the remains of a \"flying disc.\" If any of these men could be located an d persuaded to talk, the case could gain a great deal of substance.

Of those w ho were still living, how many could be found? And if any could be locat ed, would they be willing to talk about a matter almost cert ainly wrapped tightly in \"national security\" consid erations? As members of the 5O9th Bomb Group, th ey had been more security-conscious than almost any others, having been entrusted with many of the secrets of atomic bombs, dropped history's only two nu- clear weapons in wartime, and pa rticipated in postwar A-bomb tests in the Pacific. They lived with high security twenty-four hours a day. The obvious first step was to get back to retired Lt. Col. Jesse Marcel, for they knew where he liv ed and that he was willing to discuss the details he knew of the crash ... unless parties unknown had gotten to him in th e interim and convinced him he would be better off keeping quiet. He had details that were assuming great significance as th e reality of th e event became established. Moore talked with him in the middle of February 1979 and soon got in contact with his so n, Jesse, Jr., a medical doctor, pilot, and airc raft-accident investigat or. Only eleven at the time of the crash, he nevert heless had knowledge of part of the story, and now, as a leading member of his community, he was highly regarded by all who knew him. In April 1979 Dr. Marcel wrote to Moore with additional information: In reference to our recent phone conversation regarding the UFO incident of 1947 I omitted one startling description of the wreckage for fear that it might have been [interpreted as] the fanciful imagination of an 11-y ear-old.

According to my father, some of it was left behind when he and his crew visited the crash site. I suspect, however, that afte r the true nature of the craft became known to Air Force Intellig ence, the whole site was gone over with a vacuum cleaner. As early as 1979 it was becomi ng evident not only that something very mysterious had been retrieved from the New Mexico desert in 1947, but al so that additional information about it was only compounding th e mystery instead of elu- cidating it. The \"true nature of th e craft\" was only being hinted at, with talk of \"alien bodies \" and now strange symbols on pieces of th e wreckage. But hints were all that were k nown. Two men had testified to their personal contact with the peculiar wreckage; two men with good reputations and good reas ons to have been in posi- tion to have seen pi eces of the wreckage. But just two men. Hardly enough to constitute an airtight case that could be taken into court. S till, people were begi nning to talk after thirty years, and the prospect s for further disclosures were looking up. The key, of course, was the seni or Marcel, the value of whose revelations rested upon his person al stature and reliability. Far from being the sort to blurt out classified information, he had been a trusted career military man who had be en promoted from major to lieutenant colonel shortly after the crash epi- sode. He was then assigned to a vital, high-level program that collected data in a search for evidence that the Soviet Union had exploded its firs t nuclear weapon. \"W hen we finally de- tected [that] there had been a nuclear explosion, \" he told re- porter Bob Pratt in 1979, \"I had to write a re port on it. In fact, I wrote the very report that Pr esident Truman read on the air declaring Russia had exploded an atomic device.\" This report shattered the complacency of the nation, as most scientists and government officials assumed th e United States would have several more years of its mo nopoly on weapon s of mass de- struction."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"18 C RASH AT C ORONA Once Jesse Marcel Sr. had spok en out on the crash and his involvement in it, hi s son was under no pressure to keep this novel family secret, even though he was now part of the mili- tary as a National Gu ard helicopter pilot and Vietnam veteran. Neither man has indicated that any pressure was applied to keep them from talking further, no r that Jesse Sr. ever felt that national security was being en dangered by his speaking out. The first stage of the investiga tion of the crash at Corona had ended. Not that a great number of details had been disclosed, but the reality of the crash of something very strange had been established with sufficient author ity to elevate th is case to a height never approached by any other story of the crash of a flying saucer. It could yet turn ou t to be a mistake, the crash of a test rocket carryi ng a monkey, which had been exaggerated through sloppy retelling—but th e chances of that being the case were diminishing. In the past, careful investigation had always revealed major flaws in a crash report. This time, each new piece of information tended to support the premise that this might well be the big one. So far, however, there wasn't enough information considered sufficiently reliable to justify going public. All that was known with any degree of certaint y was that so mething odd had crashed in New Mexico in early July 1947; that according to an official press release, it had been recovered by the Army Air Forces; and that it had been fl own away, probably to Wright Field near Dayton, Ohio.

Exactly what was found at the Brazel ranch? 6. Where was the material ta ken, and what was done with it (and to it) prior to its being shipped from the Southwest? 7.

None of these reports, from the very first by Kenneth Arnold on June 24 through the end of the 1947 sighting wave a few weeks later, made a bit of sense to th e great majority of Americans. They lacked the technical sophi stication of their children and grandchildren, and also their de scendants' broad suspicion of the government. As a result, they were unable to see the reports as more than harm less foolishness. High-performance airplanes—jets , in particular—were just beginning to proliferate, and as ye t were seen mainly near mili- tary airfields and at air shows.

Something that doesn't exist can't very well crash, can it? It would be almost half an averag e lifetime before more than a few people began to think much about UFOs being fallible. Publicly, it looked li ke the flying saucers had flown back to nowhere at the end of the 1947 wave of sigh tings. No one in a position of authority—government officials, scientists, re- spected newsmen—had suggested that there might be any- thing more to them than a brie f, particularly frivolous fad.

As to shape, all observations state that the object is circular or at l east elliptical, flat on the bottom and slightly domed on the top.

The gap between what was happening and what was known on the outside grew wider and wider. Two weeks after Ken- tucky National Guard pilot Capt. Thomas Mantell died in the crash of his P-51 Mustang whil e trying to check out a UFO reported by hundreds of people, the first known long-term investigation of UFOs was esta blished on Janu ary 22, 1948 at Wright Field. Because it was cl assified, Project Sign was known publicly as Project Saucer, the pu rpose of which was said to be to collect reports fro m persons inside a nd outside the govern- ment and attempt to tie them to conventional sigh ts: airplanes, balloons, clouds, planets, meteor s, optical illusions, hoaxes, and so on. Sometime around August 1948 st aff members of Project Sign produced their eventually legendary Top S ecret Estimate of the Situation, which allege dly concluded th at the saucers were probably extraterrestrial. It went all the way up to the Chief of Staff, Gen. Hoyt Vand enberg, who rejected its conclu- sion as lacking evidence. All co pies were orde red destroyed, though rumors persist that at least one may have survived. On October 7, 1948, after Proj ect Sign had been in operation for almost nine months, a letter was sent by Col. H. H.

Similarly, the origin of the so-called 'flying disc s' remains obscure.\" (Emphasis added)"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"T HE G OVERNMENT AND UFO S 27 Two months later, on December 10, 1948, the USAF's Direc- torate of Intelligence issued a lengthy Analysis of Flying Object Incidents in the U.S. that remained Top Secret until 1985. It made no attempt to explain indivi dual reports but strongly sug- gested that hypothetica l Soviet developments based on captured Nazi German technology were responsible for flying saucer sightings. Singled out for particul ar attention were the experi- mental craft (mainly gliders) de veloped by the Horten brothers, despite the fact that they were characterized by very long, thin wooden wings and re sembled almost no reported saucers. The view in some circles is th at the report may be similar to the earlier Top Secret Estimate of the Situation that had been rejected, with the material about the extraterrestrial nature of the saucers replaced by that about Soviet/Nazi craft which would have been more palata ble to the Air Force brass. All was assumed to be proper in the operation of Project Sign and its successor, Project Grudge, until late December 1949, when noted aviation writer and retired Marine Corps pilot Donald Keyhoe made a series of startling accusations in True magazine. He cited inside sour ces who led him to the conclu- sion that the flying saucers were alien spacecraft bent on ex- ploring Earth. A similar claim ha d been made earlier in an obscure occult magazine, but the Hue piece was read by hun- dreds of thousands and was then picked up by the wire services and made into front-page news. Neither before nor since has th e U.S. government reacted so swiftly and definitively to a popu lar-magazine article challeng- ing its handling of the UFO problem. To counter Keyhoe's claims, the Department of Defense quickly announced: The Air Force has discontinued it s special project investigating and evaluating reported \"flying saucers\" on the basis that there is no evidence the reports are not th e result of natural phenomena. Discontinuance of the project, which was carried out by the Air Force, was concurred in the Depa rtments of the Army and Navy.

(2) A mild form of mass hysteria. (3) Or hoaxes. The Air Force said that contin uance of the project is unwar- ranted since additional incide nts now are simply confirming findings already reached. Available with the press rel ease was the 600-page Project Grudge report, which included information on 237 UFO cases—55 of which remained unexplained. Moreover, many of the explanations for reports were scientif ically weak, if not faulty. The first doubts about the sin cerity of the government's efforts to understand flying saucers had ar isen. But since al- most none of the origin al case files were available for indepen- dent evaluation, little could be done to support the slowly growing suspicions. Any developm ents within th e official in- vestigation were effectively con cealed as the reports continued to stream into the office at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. They were categorized as \"expl ained\", \"insufficient informa- tion,\" or \"unknown\", then quietly filed away for purposes yet to be understood. The evidence strongly sugge sts that Projects Sign, Grudge, and Blue Book al most certainly constituted a public relations front intended to pacify a concerned public rather than a scientific study to determine if UFOs were a threat to the national security, as its proponents insisted in countless news releases and press conferences. In 1952 the name of the inve stigation was changed from Grudge to Blue Book, and as such it woul d achieve fame and infamy far beyond what the gove rnment could have intended or expected.

With fifteen hundred reports to Project Blue B ook for all of 1952 and as many as forty per day at the height of the wave, the limited facilities of th e little office were sw amped. Cases were stacked up after having been sc anned and \"explained\" with little regard for the facts. Huge , violently mane uvering spheres were called \"balloons ,\" while discs that hovered silently and then streaked away were called \"possible aircraft.\" The situa- tion was out of control even before UFOs appeared over Wash- ington, D.C., in mid-July, tr acked on radar simultaneously from three separate locations as they flitted at will over the White House, the Capitol, and even the Pentagon. Under heavy pressure to explai n what was going on, the U.S. Air Force on July 29 held its largest press conference since World War II. Maj. Gen. John Samford of USAF Intelligence admitted that the UFO sightings were not all imagination: \"There have remained a percentage of [the] total, in the order of twenty percent of the reports, that have come from credible observers of relatively incredible things.\" And who were these \"credible observers\"? S AMFORD : \"I think there might be some- thing like eight percent that co me from civil airlines pilots. You might find another percentage, in the order of twenty-five, might come from military pilots.\" In other words, one of every three persons reporting \"relativ ely incredible things\" was a professional pilot, whose eyesight and judgment were regularly checked to make certain he c ould safely carry out his vital duties. Here was the first truly public admission from the Air Force that UFO sightings s hould be taken seriou sly. But it was over- shadowed by th e more immediate concer n of the gathering of reporters, which was the sighti ngs over Washington. These, Samford implied, were caused by temperature inversions (the source of mirages) that supposedly made lights on the ground appear to be high in the sky. This explanation was widely accepted and served its purpos e—to calm the fears of the American people, who were understandably worried about"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"30 C RASH AT C ORONA mysterious things flying over so me of the most sensitive build- ings in the country. There was absolutely no scienc e to back up General Sam- ford's theory, but th is was known only to a few scientists who had looked into the matter... a nd they kept quiet. Many years later, an official Ai r Force scientific re port demolished the \"temperature inversion\" explan ation for UFOs, but it was not publicized and thus had no impact. On the same day the Air Force held its big press conference the Central Intelligence Agency began a series of hush-hush meetings to deal wi th its concern that a flood of UFO reports could clog the nation's communica tions channels and be used by some enemy as a smoke screen to conceal an attack. This led to the January 1953 meeting of a select group of scientists under chairman H. P. Robertson that spent several hours study- ing UFO case files provided by the Air Force. It then announced (in great secrecy, of course) that they showed no evidence of being a threat to national security or of being extraterrestrial spacecraft. The CIA re commended the situation be defused by removing much of the mystery. Instead, Project Blue Book adopt ed an even more restrictive policy on public information and soon reduced its contact with the press and the American peopl e to an annual report listing the percentages of sightings e xplained as ball oons, satellites, and the like while stressing the lack of evidence that UFOs were anything more than mist akes. But while the statistics supported the Air Force's claims of increasing ef fectiveness, more and more case files were becoming public knowledge and illustrating the serious inepti tude of Project Blue Book. On July 31, 1952, just two da ys after the Ai r Force press conference that paraded the supposed efficiency of Project Blue Book in explaining UFOs, a me morandum was prepared on the subject by Brig. Gen. Alfred R. Maxwell of the Research and Development Board. Until recently it was classi fied Security Information Confidential. While it generally supported the official position that UFO repor ts contain no information of value, one statement st ands out in stark cont rast to the rest of"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"T HE G OVERNMENT AND UFO S 31 the memo and to all contempor ary and subsequent official statements: \"... the Ai r Force has made very little progress in learning what the phenomena or objects are and what causes them.\" After five years of trying ! Had this not re mained secret for almost a third of a century after it was written, the stature of the government's overt UFO investigation might not have seemed quite so impressive. In 1955 the Air Force issued a thick document called Blue Book Special Report 14 , a statistical analysis of all the reports received for its first six year s. Prepared by the private and respected Battelle Memorial In stitute in Columbus, Ohio, and reportedly funded by the Central Intellige nce Agency, it was a civilian study of the official data. Of 2,199 cases considered th rough the end of 1952, the Air Force's own people had determined that 290 of them (13 per- cent) could not be e xplained. The independe nt Battelle scien- tists, however, classified 434 (20 percent) as unexplained, and that was boosted to 22 percent when the cases lacking suf- ficient detail for analysis were eliminated. Either way, a lot of UFO reports remained without satisfactory explanation, de- spite implications to the contra ry in the press release that accompanied the report when it wa s revealed to the public in October 1955. \"No evidence of the existence of the popularly-termed 'fly- ing saucers' was found.\" The pr ess release stressed the al- legedly improved methods and pro cedures of early 1955 (a time period having absolutely no c onnection with Special Report 14). Air Force Secretary Donald Quarles was quoted: \"I feel certain that even the unknow n three percent [for 1955, not 1947-1952]) could have been explained as conventional phe- nomena or illusions if more co mplete observational data had been available.\" This was in di rect contradic tion of the way sightings had always been classified, \"ins ufficient data\" cases being in their own category and completely separate from the \"unknowns.\" Perhaps the most telling revela tion of the Battelle indepen- dent analysis can be found in a set of pie charts illust rating the"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"32 C RASH AT C ORONA relationship between the technica l qualifications and reliabil- ity of the witnesses, and the pe rcentage of une xplained cases. For witnesses rated Poor-to-D oubtful, only 14 percent of the reports couldn't be explained by the Battelle scientists. But for witnesses rated Good-to-E xcellent, twice as many—27 percent—couldn't be explained. Cl early, the better the witness, the harder it was to explain a UFO report. Had th is instead of irrelevant material been emphasi zed in the press release, the public might have rea lized that many UFO re ports were still a major mystery to th e U.S. Air Force. Now, if there was a report numbe red 14, shouldn't there, by all the laws of logic, be thir teen previous reports? Hints of earlier Project Blue B ook reports had been floating around for several years, but so little was known about them that it had to be assumed that if they existed at all, they must still be classi- fied. As there was no way to obt ain material cl assified Con- fidential, Secret, Top Secret, and so on, a lot of possibly important information was being held back. Unbeknown to anyone, Project Grudge and Blue Book Re- ports 1 through 12, dated 1951-19 53, had been declassified from Confidential and Secret as early as 1960. But the facts of their writing, classification, a nd eventual declas sification had not been announced. Once the situation became known to National Investigations Comm ittee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), an effort wa s begun through the Government Opera- tions Committee of the House of Representatives to override the refusal of the Air Force to re lease this unclassified material. Thanks to the assistance of C ongress, they we re pried loose from the Air Force and publishe d by NICAP in 1968. Report 13 is still the subject of rumors and denials. Now, for the very fi rst time, there was proof that the U.S. government had withheld unclassified UFO information from the public. These periodic status reports of Projects Grudge and Blue Book revealed a great de al about the inner workings of the only known official investig ation. Moreover , they added considerable weight to a 1958 commercially published book about Project Blue Book by Edwa rd Ruppelt, project director"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"T HE G OVERNMENT AND UFO S 33 when most of the reports were written. Conflicts within the government on UFO polic y were aired, as were some of the failures of the system. Dozens of previously unheard-of UFO reports were open ed to debate. The efficiency and effectivene ss of Project Blue Book were brought into question by the project's own words. Those who had long been challenging the Air Force's handling of its UFO investigation suddenly had a st orehouse of ammunition pro- vided by the Air Force itself. P ublic and press confidence in the ability of the government to cope with UFOs dr opped to a new low. In the spring of 1964 another startling ne ws report came out of New Mexico that must have raised considerable consterna- tion at the Pentagon. Patrolman Lonnie Zamora, of the Socorro Police Department, radioed his hea dquarters that he had seen a landed UFO accompanied by two sm all, white-suited individ- uals, parked in a barren area outs ide town. He said he got close enough to see an \"insignia\" on the side of the metallic, egg- shaped object before it began to roar and spout flame. Fearing it was about to explode, he ducked down behind his cruiser, then looked up when the noise cease d and saw the craft hovering a few feet in the air and making absolutely no sound. After it flew away, he walked do wn to the landing site with a police sergeant who had responded to his radioed call for assis- tance, and they found burned shrubs, scorched ground, and indentations in the soil corre sponding to the location of the object's landing gear. Within two hours an Army Intelligence agen t from the White Sands Proving Ground was th ere, as was an FBI agent, and their intensive investiga tion resulted in a lengthy report detailing the event. They were clearly impressed by Officer Zamora, as was Project Blue Book scientific consultant Dr. J. Allen Hynek, who ar rived a day later. Half-hearted official efforts to explain the UFO as a rancher's helicopter or a NASA moon-landi ng test vehicle were quickly dropped, as neither could possibl y account for th e main charac- teristics of the sighting, especi ally the silent hovering. When"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"34 C RASH AT C ORONA Project Blue Book clos ed its doors in 1969 , this case was still listed as unknown, and the fina l chief of the project, Maj. Hector Quintanilla, ca lled it the most puz zling report of more than twelve thousand in the files. The Socorro landi ng is widely regarded as one of the most impressive and baffling cases of all. As such, it placed such previously \"far-out\" aspects of the subject as nuts-and-bolts high-performance craft and sm all humanoid crew members somewhere near the center. This UFO gave every indication of being a solid object... something manufactured... a machine. There was no need to invoke such esoteric explanations as parallel universes or psychic projections to account for some- thing that looked and acted like a very advanced form of trans- portation. So advanced that it cannot be understood. But not necessarily so advanced th at it might never crash. In 1965 an effort was begun to rebuild public confidence in the official investigation, which had been badly damaged by repeated disclosures of the failure of Project Blue Book explanations to match the fact s on which they were supposed to be based. The upshot wa s a $500,000-plus government contract to the University of Colorado to study the Air Force investigation—in public. The in itially enthusiastic support from the major private UFO gr oups soon turned sour, as it became apparent that outspoke n study director Dr. Edward Condon had concluded well in ad vance that th ere was nothing to be learned from investigating UFOs. When his unscientific attitude could no longer be ignored, two scientist members of the Co lorado group went public with a damaging document and were promptly fired. Despite the open controversy, the final report of the Condon Committee was completed in 1968, blessed by the National Academy of Sciences, and then published commercially. Dr. Condon's thor- oughly negative summation was in stark contrast to the fas- cinating data buried in the lengthy report, where 30 percent of the cases were left without conv entional explanation. Of more than 550 unexplained reports th en in the Project Blue Book files, only three were considered by the University of Colorado, while current sightings having little chance of being signifi-"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"T HE G OVERNMENT AND UFO S 35 cant were given expensive on-the- spot investigations. It was a highly unsatisfy ing exercise. While the Condon report was wi dely accepted as the final word on UFOs, not everyone ag reed. The prestigious American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, professional society of the aerospace industry, stated: \"The opposite conclusion could have been drawn from its content, namely that a phe- nomenon with such a high rate of unexplained cases (about 30%) should arouse sufficient scient ific curiosity to continue its study.\" But the Condon report di d its job, which wa s to give the Air Force an excuse to retire from the increasingly embarrassing UFO-investigating business. On December 17, 1969, Project Blue Book was shut down after almost twenty-t wo years of collecting reports an d combating charges. The final tally showed 12,783 reports receive d and 585 declared \"Unknown.\" At least several hundred of the so-called explained reports were anything but explained in scientific terms. But once Proj- ect Blue Book was disbanded, its files were removed from Wright-Patterson, firs t to the Air Force Archives at Maxwell AFB, Alabama, and then to the National Archives in Washing- ton, D.C., where all names of witnesses were removed. The open, public involvemen t of the U.S. Air Force, and indeed the U.S. government, with UFOs was at an end. The incessant claims by the Ai r Force that it was no longer concerned with UFOs after 1969 are hollow. A careful reading of the memo that re commended the closing of the project, as well as a staff summary which acc ompanied it, reveals the true state of affairs. Brig. Gen. Carroll H. Bolender, Air Fo rce Deputy Chief of Staff for Research and Devel opment, stated on October 20, 1969, that the Air Forc e investigation (not specifically limited to Project Blue Book) had tw o objectives: \"to determine whether UFOs pose any threat to the security of the United States; and to determine whet her UFOs exhibit any unique scientific information or a dvanced technology which could contribute to scientific or technical research.\" He then said that \"the continuation of Project Blue Book"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"36 C RASH AT C ORONA cannot be justified, either on the grounds of national security or in the interest of science.\" He does not say that there is no justification for the continuatio n of other Air Force UFO activ- ity. In fact, he leaves that door wide open: \"However, as already stated, reports of UFOs which could affect na tional security would continue to be handled through the standard Air Force procedures designed for this purpose.\" Bolender adds: \"The Air Force experience therefore confirms the impression of the University of Colorado re searchers that the defense function could be pe rformed within the framework established for intelligence and surveillance operations with- out the continuation of a special unit such as Project Blue Book.\" Clearly, all that happened in December 1969 was that Proj- ect Blue Book was ended, while th e remainder of Air Force (and other governmental) UFO-relate d activities no doubt contin- ued unabated, since \"reports of unidentified flying objects which could affect national secu rity are made in accordance with JANAP 146 or Air Force Manual 55-11, and are not part of the Blue Book system\" (emphasis added). If the national secur ity-related UFO report s never were seen by the people in Project Blue Bo ok, then their contention that UFOs showed no evidence of a th reat to nationa l security is empty. And since there was a special procedure for handling UFO reports having natio nal security aspects, then is it possi- ble that UFOs involve some kind of threat to the nation? At the very least, someone must have thought so. When Project Blue Book shut its doors, it signaled the end of an era. The press and the pub lic, aware only of the totally negative conclusions of the Condon Report and the apparent end of all official interest in UFOs, assumed the subject was dead. There were scattered li ngering doubts, especially among those who remained convinced they had seen unexplained things flying through the sky. But for most people, UFOs were about to fade into history. The major private organization—NICAP—rapidly lost its mass appeal, its funding which came almost entirely from"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"T HE G OVERNMENT AND UFO S 37 membership fees, and its abilit y to pressure the government. Its once busy downtown Washington office was closed to per- mit construction of a station of the new Metro subway system, and its shrinking operatio ns were relo cated in a suburb, out of sight. For several years so little was heard about UFOs that it was as if they had never existed in the first place. Many once- confident UFO activists could ha rdly be blamed for wondering if they really had be en as gullible as the Air Force had so often implied. All but the largest of the civilian groups vanished, and the others shrank into impotence . Sources of information rap- idly dried up. If UFOs were s till being seen, it was all but impossible to find out anything about them. Maybe they had finally lost interest in human affairs and gone home. When the Air Force closed Proj ect Blue Book, its position on the controversial matter was th e same as it ha d been for many years, and would remain for many more: (1) no unidentified flying object re ported, investigated and eval- uated by the Air Force has ever given any indication of threat to our nation al security; (2) there has been no evidence s ubmitted to or discovered by the Air Force that sigh tings categorized as UNIDENTIFIED rep- resent technological developmen ts or principles beyond the range of pres ent-day scientific knowledge; and (3) there has been no evidence indi cating that si ghtings catego- rized as UNIDENTIFIED are extraterrestrial vehicles. The final word? Not quite! Th e loopholes are enormous: 1. No threat to national secu rity? Certainly not from cases in the Project Blue Book files. Bu t as for other cases, they would be buried deep in s ecure filing cabinets and computer data- bases and could not be referred to in uncl assified documents. The mere existence of procedures to deal with reports having national security implications raises a lot of questions the government refuse s to address."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"38 C RASH AT C ORONA 2. So what if none of Blue Book's UNIDENTIFIED cases is said to represent ev idence of advanced technology? It all de- pends on its never-specified de finition of \"technological de- velopments or principles be yond the range of present-day scientific knowledge.\" No claim is made that sightings catego- rized as other than UNIDENTIFI ED represent ad vanced tech- nology, and it is ce rtainly possible that one or more classified investigations use other term s to describe such reports. One is left wondering exactly what it would take to convince the Air Force that within th e 585 UNIDENTIFIED reports there is evidence beyond pres ent-day knowledge? Do they think disc-shaped, cyli ndrical and spherical aircraft are within present-day knowledge? That silent supersonic flight can be achieved using what is known ab out aerodynamics? That long- term hovering followed by astounding acceleration is fully understood by aeronauti cal engineers? On the contrary, these achievements are far beyond the st ate of the art, and the big aerospace firms wo uld kill to know how to build aircraft capa- ble of such flight! 3. As for no sightings represen ting extraterrestrial vehicles .. . perhaps this can be supported. But how about crashes?. Maybe you can't see into a UFO as it flies by to check out the physical characteristics of it s crew. But when you find one on the ground, it's anothe r matter. Such cute fiddling with the language may conceal matter s of cosmic importance. There is no evidence that anyone connected with Project Blue Book or its predecessors bothered to study the \"uniden- tified\" cases as a group, to see if they amounted to more than a hodgepodge of unrelated anecdo tes. Had anyone bothered to make such a study, he certainly would have found distinct patterns of both appearance and behavior displayed by the almost-600 UNIDENTIFIED cases, as well as hundreds more that should have been called \"unidentified.\" This, in turn, would have led straight to the conclusion that the men who looked at the very first \"flying disc\" reports in the summer of 1947 were correct when they c oncluded that \"something is really flying around.\""},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"T HE G OVERNMENT AND UFO S 39 This, of course would have produced a major embarrass- ment, for it would have negated decades of pronouncements by official spokesperson s who obviously were under strict orders to play down UFOs by any mean s available. The men at Project Blue Book, and their superiors, were not stupid; they were simply following their orders and being careful not to rock the boat. It is entirely possible that th ey were being taken advantage of just as much as the Amer ican people who swallowed their lies. After all, it doesn't take a ge nius to see that the material in the Project Blue Book files can more easily be used to demon- strate that UFOs are highly pu zzling than that they have all been explained. It just takes a visit to the microfilm reading room of the National Archives on the Mall in Washington, D.C. The information is there to se e and to copy and to analyze. Clearly, someone in a position of power saw Project Blue Book as a tool for influencing publ ic opinion, rath er than as a device for learning about UFOs. When it comes to hiding the truth from the public over a long period of time, it may have no rivals in recorded history. As long as the existence of UFOs can be held up to serious doubt, ther e is little danger that anyone will take reports of th eir crashing seriously. It wasn't just the U.S. governme nt that recognized the crash(es) in New Mexico as an important event. In August 1991 it was revealed in Rabochaya Tribuna [The Workers' Tribune) pub- lished in Moscow, that no less a figure than Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin took the news to heart back in 1947. The nearly full-page intervie w with Professor Valery Bur- dakov, of the Scientific Geoinformation Center of the USSR Academy of Sciences, revealed th at Stalin had called in several of his top scientists after the \"sensationa l news generated by the capture of a 'sau cer' that purportedl y had crashed near Roswell.\" These scientists included Serg ey Korolyev, designer of the first Soviet military rocket in 1947 and of the launchers that"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"40 C RASH AT C ORONA put Sputnik I into space in 1957 a nd Yuri Gagarin up in 1962. It was he who told Profes sor Burdakov about St alin's great inter- est. Other involved sc ientists reportedly included M. Tikhon- ravov, who had been experimenting with liquid-fuel rockets since the early 1930s; Mstislav Keldysh, who wo rked fo r Ko- rolyev in 1947 and later became president of th e USSR Acad- emy of Sciences; and nuclear physicist Alexandr Topchiyev, who became vice president of the academy. According to Burdakov, Stalin had several women assigned to Korolyev as transl ators to help him with \"a pile of foreign materials and books\" related to the UFO phenomenon, and Burdakov was told that the res earch had to be done in secrecy. \"Several days later, he was i nvited to come and see Stalin himself,\" Burdakov said. \"Stalin asked him for his opinion and Sergey [Korolyev] replied that, in his view, the UFO is not a weapon of a potential enemy a nd does not represent any se- rious danger for the country, but evidently the phenomenon is real.\" Korolyev advised Stalin that , when the opportunity arose, the phenomenon should be studied further, and Stalin replied that Korolyev's opinion was simila r to those of other specialists who had been presented with this problem. The others are thought to have included Keldys h and Topchiyev. It appears that Stal in may have created his own MJ-12-like group (see Chapter 6) to learn what it could from the crash activity in New Mexico. And it can be surmised (in the under- standable absence of detailed info rmation) that the initial lead could have come from Soviet spies, some of whom are known to have been in New Mexico in the early pos t-World War II period."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" RIOR TO 1978 reports of cras hed alien craft being spirited away by government agents were the substance of science fiction and a few extreme flyi ng saucer magazines. Each report of a crash had died of st arvation: Without any form of verification, there was nothing to keep it alive but a few indi- viduals' need to believe. For the vast majority of even those who were convinced that UFOs were real and quite possibly unearthly, the idea that some of them had crashed and been captured was going too far. The s ubject simply wa s not worthy of serious discussion. Then Leonard Stringfield came winging out of Cincinnati to drop his bomb at the July 1978 annu al convention of the Mu- tual UFO Network (MUFON), a na tionwide assembly of pri- vate UFO investigators, enthus iasts, and hangers-on. This particular meeting was held in Dayton, Ohio, not far from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base , the home of the old Project Blue Book and the scene of so ma ny rumors of alien bodies held in cold storage in the probably mythical Hangar 18. String- field's disclosures were made in an unusually tense atmo- sphere, following a telephoned th reat on his life which the local police took seriously enough to warrant a shift in his hotel room and a lot of myst erious scurrying around.

He was regarded as a methodical, reliable investigator who measured his words and protected his sources. He was about to feel the glare of a not- entirely-welcome spotlight. What distinguished Stringfield from the others who had en- countered stories of UFO crashe s was his eventu al willingness to gather up these orphans who ha d been rejected by the family of otherwise courageo us UFO investigators. Convinced that something of value lay within the hard-to-believe and harder- to-verify crash reports, he we nt at it with a vengeance. While writing his second book, Situation Red, the UFO Siege, he had begun to focus on rumo rs of crashe s, which he first referred to as Retrievals of the Third Kind and later as simply Crash/Retrievals or just C/R. Publication of the book in 1977 brought additional leads to C/R events, and by 1978 he was ready to go pub lic in a big way. Stringfield spoke at the Da yton MUFON meeting for two hours, detailing one C/R after an other, to the amazement of the hundreds of veteran UFO invest igators who had shunned this subcategory of repor ts prior to the une xpected outpouring of information. Much of the between-lectur es chatter centered around Stringfield's revelations , and whether he was unusually perceptive or unusually gullible.

On the face of it, the gr eat revelation was pretty weak: few names, few exact locations or dates. No clear patterns. Only the true believer could hear or read Stringfield's accounts and make more of them than a bunch of disconnected scraps that added up to very little.

It seemed that almost ev eryone had hear d at least one report of a cras h but had been unabl e or unwilling to investigate it for fear of being laughed at and losing hard-won community stature. Now, however, with the cat out of the bag, it was suddenly accept able to speak openl y of crashed flying saucers. First, however, all this had to be digested, for it carried UFOs into a much more personal and potentially threatening realm. Every private researcher and in vestigator had to weigh the risks inherent in the dangerou s journey into a subject that could easily make him the object of ridicu le. But the possible payoff was just too great. If just one crash-and-retrieval could be proved, or even supported by good testimony by individuals willing to be identified publicly, then all the grea t sightings in anyone's file would be rendered unimportant. Stringfield had the ju mp on his fellow inve stigators, but he was spreading his time and effort over dozens of cases, while others could concentrate on one or two cases a nd thus stand a chance of getting ahead. Besides, Stringfield was known to be so methodical and cautious th at others might well turn his leads into useful informati on while Len was plodding along. Among those galvanized into action by the shocking revela- tions at Dayton was Stanton Frie dman. It had been but a few months since his revealing talk with Jesse Marcel, who de- scribed recovering st range debris from a sheep ranch. A few months after the Dayton meeting, Friedman talked with Vern Maltais and got the story of Barney Barnett at the Plains of San Augustin. Soon he adde d confirmation of Ma rcel's claims in 1947 newspaper stories. While Stringfield and others were working on their choices of promising leads, Friedman and Bill Moore zeroed in on the Corona, New Mexico, crash, for it was then thought the downed craft seen by Barnett must have been the one that left some of its pieces on the Foster ranch before cr ashing 150 miles to the west. They had a growing collection of names to check, and many of those na med contributed even more names of people to track."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"T HE S EARCH I NTENSIFIES 45 In January 1980 Stringfiel d privately published his Status Report II: New Sources, New Data, which corrected errors in his first report, elaborated on se veral of his original cases, and added some new ones. Of particular interest was his inclusion of illustrations: of an alien body based on a description from a doctor who claimed to have perf ormed an autopsy; of an alien head from reports given by severa l alleged witnesses; and of an alien hand which a fo rmer CIA employee said was accurately drawn. Like most of his other information, however, there was no way to cross-ch eck any of this. But others were taking over th e vanguard of the search for proof that a UFO had crashed years before, especially the rumors of such activ ity in New Mexico. In the summer of 1980 The Roswell Incident was published. Researched by Bill Moore and Stanton Friedman (who r eceived limited credit in the book and some royalties), and writt en by Moore and famed travel writer Charles Berlitz, it mixe d together what was then known about the crashes at Corona and San Agustin with a lot of extraneous material about UF O sightings by astronauts. The book was generally accurate, but confusingly organized and hard to follow. Despite its shortcomings, it spre ad the news of the probable crash to more and more peopl e, and firmly (though mislead- ingly) established Roswell as the center of crash activity. Friedman and Moore continue d to track down and inter- view witnesses and periodically wrote papers recounting their progress.

Stringfield, on the other hand, continued to make the point that there could be a dozen or more crashes, yet did little in-depth investi- gation, and so his cases remain ed vague and in conclusive. He continued to report that his flow of information from infor- mants was subject to abrupt changes: After a period of intense activity it all stopped, as if so meone were orchestrating the flow. But nothing was offered as solid evidence of this presum- ably governmental interference. In July 1989, during the MUFON symposiu m in Las Vegas, Nevada, Bill Moore startled th e large crowd by admitting to having cooperated with a gove rnment disinformation cam- paign by observing its damaging impact on a witness. His reputation as a source of reliable informat ion suffered, as did his ability to contribute to UF O research. Whose side was he on? Was some of the informat ion Moore published actually disinformation? His direct involvement with the widely panned UFO Cover-Up, Live! TV special detracted further from his reputation. Stanton Friedman had no choice but to face this unfortunate situation and disengage hi mself from the once-productive relationship wi th Moore and his partner, Jaime Shandera. In September 1989, the NBC-TV series Unsolved Mysteries led off its new season with a half-hour reenactment of the Corona crash, hiring Friedman as a technical adviser and on- camera expert. The show, which was more accurate than the genre referred to as tabloid TV depicted the crash scenes and alien bodies in a nonsensational fashion and drew one of the highest ratings of the week. When repeated the following Janu- ary, it was again one of the week 's top twenty shows. Tens of millions saw the two pr ograms, and scores of them called a special telephone number to offer assistance.

In fact, the process has been a lot like trying to assemble a blank jigsaw puzzle of unknown size and shape in a room illuminated by a single forty-watt bulb. One especially important pi ece of the crash puzzle sat around for years before anyone was able to figure out where it fit. The piece came from the Canadian government, an un- likely source of UFO information. In 1979, Stanton Frie dman was shown a formerly top-secret memorandum by Canadian investig ator Scott Foster.

The entire matter is considered by the United States authori- ties to be of tremendous significance. What, if anything, did this m ean? Smith was known to have had a strong interest in UF Os and had corresponded exten- sively on the subject with Donald Keyhoe and NICAP. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Smith exhibited growing signs of mental disturbance blamed on the brain tumor that was to take his life in 1962. But through most of the 1950s he was consid- ered a highly qualified engin eer who explored a number of unconventional concepts involv ing gravity and electromag- netism. Smith was awarded the Canadian Engineering Award posthumously for \"Dedicated service in the advancement of the technical standards in Canadian broadcasting.\" If what Smith wrote was true, then it was the most impor- tant UFO-related gov ernment information yet seen. Arthur Bray received the memo from the Canadian government in 1978 (again, possibly by accident) and was eventually able to track down the son of Wilbert Smith and read Smith's hand- written notes on the Sept ember 12, 1950, meeting.

But is it genuine? Fortunately, there are names within the notes that can be checked, and since the notes were found in a large coll ection of Smith's materials and were in his handwriting, it can reasonably be assumed that they were indeed made by Smith. It wasn't hard to check out \"L t/C. Bremner,\" who turned out to have been the defense attach e at the Canadian embassy in Washington, just the sort of pers on to be involved in a meeting of this magnitude. One down, one to go. And that one—Dr. Robert Sarbacher—would turn out to be the most important individual yet c onnected with the UFO story. Stanton Friedman, with the coop eration of Arthur Bray, took up the challenge and in 1982 fo und Dr. Sarbacher in a directory of leading scientists: A consulta nt to the U.S. Research and Development Board, he had been the dean of the graduate school at Georgia Tech and wa s operating his own scientific laboratory, which did some government work. In the fall of 1983, UFO enthus iast William Steinman had a brief exchange of correspondence with Dr. Sarbacher that pro- duced these answers to his questions: STEINMAN : Relate your own expe rience as pertaining to your involvem ent with these recovered flying saucers—description of saucers, occupants, names of others involved, places of re coveries, dates of recov- eries, etc. SARBACHER : Relating to my own expe rience regarding fly- ing saucers, I had no associa tion with any of the people involved in the recovery and have no knowledge re- garding the dates of the recoveries. If I had I would send it to you. STEINMAN : Verification that the pe rsons listed were in- volved: (a) Thomas Townsend Brown; (b) Dr. Weisberg; (c) Dr. Robert H.

SARBACHER : Regarding verification that persons you list were involved, I can only say this: John von Neuman was definitely involved. Dr . Vannevar Bush was defi- nitely involved, and I thi nk Dr. Robert Oppenheimer also. My association with the Research and De- velopment Board under D r. Compton during the Eisenhower administration wa s rather limited so that although I had been invited to participate in several discussions associated with the reported recoveries, I could not personally attend the meetings. I am sure that they would have as ked Dr. von Braun, and the others that you listed were probably asked and may or may not have attended. That is all I know for sure. STEINMAN : A copy of the official Govt. report pertaining to the Aztec, New Mexico re covery [a pa rticular in- terest of Steinman, though not highly regarded by others], or any other that you might have access to. SARBACHER : I did receive some offici al reports when I was in my office at the Pentagon , but all of these were left there as at the ti me we were never supposed to take them out of the office. STEINMAN : Copies of the photographs of the recovered fly- ing saucers both at the \"Crash-Site\" and at the labora- tory, and photographs of th e occupants of these flying saucers. SARBACHER : I do not recall receiving any photographs such as you request, so I am not in a position to answer. STEINMAN : Copies of the official analysis reports both on the saucers and the occupants. SARBACHER : I have to make the same reply as on [the pre- vious request]. I recall the interview with Dr. Brenner [sic] of the Canadian Embassy. I think the answers I gave him were the ones you listed. Naturally, I was more familiar with the s ubject matter under discus- sion at that time. Actually, I would have been able to"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"52 C RASH AT C ORONA give more specific answer s had I attended the meet- ings concerning the subject. You must understand that I took this assignment as a private contribution. We were called \"dollar-a-year men.\" My first respon- sibility was the maintenance of my own business ac- tivity so that my participation was limited. About the only thing I rememb er at this time is that certain materials reported to have come from flying saucer crashes were extremel y light and very tough. I am sure our laboratories anal yzed them very carefully. There were reports that in struments or people oper- ating these machines were al so of very light weight, sufficient to withstand the tremendous deceleration and acceleration associated with their machinery. I remember in talking with some of the people at the office that I got the impres sion these \"aliens\" were constructed like certain inse cts we have observed on earth, wherein because of the low mass the inertial forces involved in opera tion of these instruments would be quite low. I still do not know why the hi gh order of classifica- tion has been given and why the denial of the exis- tence of these devices. In early December 1983, Stan ton Friedman called Dr. Sar- bacher and was assured that mu ch of the information reported by Steinman was accurate. He al so learned that Sarbacher had moved at a very high level in the government and knew many important people. It was therefor e logical that he would have been exposed to such sensitive information. A further contact with him was made in 1985 by Dr. Bruce Maccabee, a U.S. Navy physicist who heads the Fund for UFO Research. Dr. Sarbacher told him \"There is something I should have done but didn't do. I had a re quest to visit a site [Maccabee notes: He thinks the request cam e from Wright Field or that the site was Wright Fi eld] regarding a fallen UFO and at that time could not go, [being] tied up with personal business. But"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"T HE C ANADIAN C ONNECTION 53 some of the men did go. I went to the office [of the Research and Development Board] some time af ter they got back and talked to some of the guys who saw it. I wish I could have gone.\" Maccabee asked him to relate his impression of what the men told him they saw. \"My im pression of what the men said who took the trip to Wright Fi eld: the 'people' who operated those things were built different than we. They s eemed to have no inertia, seemed to be like insects, ma ybe they were robots [Maccabee's note: This seemed to stick particularly in his mind]. While no \"smoking gun\" resulte d from the exch anges with Dr. Sarbacher (who died in 1986), his credentials were verified, and thus the amazing memo by Wilbert Smith was given great credibility. Clearly, wreckage and probably bodies were at Wright Field in the early 1950s. Sarbacher told Friedman in a face-to-face meeting in 1983 that there could have been several crashes and that he did not kno w which crash had produced the materials seen by his associates. The value of the test imony by Sarbacher an d Smith is in the substantiating of rumors of the involvement of Wright Field as a place where material s and/or bodies were located, at least temporarily. Even though Dr. Sarb acher was not ab le to add a great deal of detail , his stature makes the confirmation of government knowledge of crashe d UFOs more impressive than any previous testimony. A key bit of information was the first mention of Dr. Van- nevar Bush in connection with UFOs. While investigating him, Friedman discovered that Bu sh was the common link among the groups named in th e secret (not top secret) September 23, 1947, memo from Gen. Nathan Tw ining that listed those to which copies of the best sauc er information should be sent. These included the Joint Res earch and Development Board and its predecessor, the Office of Scientific Research and De- velopment (Bush headed both and was thus close to the devel- opment of the atomic bomb, pr oximity fuse, a nd other major projects); the National Adviso ry Committee on Aeronautics (Bush had been chairman of th is NASA predecessor); and the"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"54 C RASH AT C ORONA Atomic Energy Commission, postw ar successor to the Man- hattan Project. Vannevar Bush had easy acce ss to the White House during the war, serving as he did on many vital committees. Thus he would have been in the right pla ce to take a major part in the analysis of saucer wreckage a nd bodies. These and other groups (such as the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board and the Rand Corporation) were not concerned with day-to-day defense ac- tivities, but rather with long-term scientific work. They were just the groups to which one would turn upon finding the remains of a crashed saucer."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" AJESTIC -12 is quite possibly th e single most important key to the entire UF O mystery. Except th at it has yet to be positively determined that there is a door into which the key fits. Or if this is the correct key to open a very important door.

The chances of this being the case have de- creased almost to zero, and so the possibility that the docu- ments were created out of whole cloth seems minimal. The story of Majestic-12 emer ged from the catacombs of the U.S. Intelligence community (including the CIA, NSA, FBI, Defense Intelligence Agency, Na tional Reconnaissance Office, and a few other intensely inc onspicuous operat ions), in De- cember 1984, in a manner guaranteed to create suspicion. It arrived in a plain envelope havi ng no return address but an Albuquerque, New Mexico, postmark in the form of a can of exposed-but-unproc essed black-and- white 35mm film. The innocuous-looki ng package arrived at the home of Los Angeles movie producer Jaime Sh andera, who was known to be working with UFO investigator Bill Moore in intelligence- related activities. When developed and printed, the film revealed eight pages of a purport ed briefing paper for president- elect Dwight Eisenhower, dated November 18, 1952. It de- scribed the discovery, recovery, an d preliminary analysis of the remains of what crashed seventy-five miles northwest of Roswell, New Mexico. Moore and Shandera, together with Stanton Friedman, spent the next two years trying to determine if the document was genuine or phony. Subtle clues and myster ious messages from a growing collection of intelligence (or disinformation) contacts led to furtive phone calls and meetings, but not to much of substance that would enable them to st ate with confidence that the Eisenhower briefing pa per was real. By the spring of 1987, the matter remained as puzzling and inconclusive as ever. Under circumstances not yet clear, another copy of the docu- ment was sent to English UFO writer Timothy Good, engaged in preparing a book about g overnmental involvement with UFOs. He receive d his copy in March 1987 and included it in his Above Top Secret, published in England in May. By then, Moore and Shandera had released a preliminary version of their document, in an unfortunately abbreviated and censored form,"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"M AJESTIC -12 57 with the original security clas sification words crossed out in quasi-official style (by M oore, as it turned out). At the MUFON symposium at American University in Washington, D.C., in June 1987, the full document was released by Moore and company. But as ve rification was still lacking, this kicked off a flurry of ru mors, denials, and accusations. Before the meaning and the importance of the Eisenhower briefing paper can be j udged, it first must be shown that it is genuine, and that has so far pr oved extremely difficult. Simply asking the appropriate people in the government if it is real would seem to be th e logical way to find out. Failing this, a request under the useful provisions of the Freedom of Informa- tion Act would be in order. But an y document as highly classi- fied as this one app ears to be on its face would be k nown to but a few especially trustworthy individuals who could be counted on to keep their mouths shut about it. The Freedom of Infor- mation Act, as effective as it can be, does not prov ide entree to highly classified info rmation whose very ex istence is easy to deny and all but impossible to prove. If the Eisenhower briefing paper is an officially approved hoax, finding the person or offi ce responsible for its creation and then extracting a confession would be ne xt to impossible. It would therefore appear that keeping the document from being proved either genuine or fa ke is all but guaranteed. It is certain to remain controvers ial until someone comes forth with proof, one way or the other. The immediate reaction to the emergence of the document, from several factions —both pro- and anti- UFO reality—was to declare it a hoax , even a \"proven hoax.\" Alleged discrepancies in the form, or the typeface, or the official ja rgon claimed to have been standard in 1952 were trumpeted as proo f that it had been concocted by unknown partie s for purposes never made quite clear. Proponents of the paper's validity, along with others not ready to condemn it as a fake on the basis of some- what flimsy evidence, set to wo rk to find out all they could about the document, without any great expectati ons of arriv- ing at a final answer."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"58 C RASH AT C ORONA What is very clear is that whoever composed the Eisenhower briefing paper, be he a legitimate part of an MJ-12, a vintage hoaxer or a recent one, knew a gr eat deal about UFO history, about the crash near Corona, a nd about the inner workings of the U.S. government, including the backgrounds and activities of the twelve men alleged to have been the original members of Majestic-12. It could hardly be just another cr ude hoax perpe- trated by some wag with an old typewriter, like several that had bedeviled the private UFO comm unity over the years. It had taken a lot of research and ch ecking and probably prior hoaxing experience, and thus must be ve ry important to its originator, rather than a mere prank. But why go to all this troubl e to create a phony document? Was it to embarrass and discredit UFO i nvestigators (thereby reducing their effectiveness) by getting them to accept the document as real and then reveal ing it as a fake and those who believed it as pathetically gullibl e? If so, the hoaxer has let a lot of years and a lot of opportunities go by wi thout speaking out. And with each passing year there is the growing likelihood that a claim or admission of hoaxing ma y not be believed. After all, for someone simply to stand up and announce \"Ho ho! I did it and you dummies fell for it!\" won' t be enough. Proof that it was a hoax will be demanded, and th at could prove as elusive as establishing absolute auth enticity has so far been. Was it meant to occupy the time and energy of the best people in the UFO community and thus draw their attention away from some other govern ment UFO event or non-UFO project that was considered more sensitive, or on the verge of being revealed? One has to wonder just what could be more volatile than th e discovery of proof that UFOs are alien spacecraft. More and more, it appears that even if the Eisenhower brief- ing paper is a hoax, there must be something very similar in existence, since the reality of the Corona crash increases in probability with each passing day. W hy fake a document when a real one with substantially similar content may be in the very next filing cabinet?"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"M AJESTIC -12 59 It is also a possibi lity that the original purpose of a phony briefing paper has been made obso lete by events subsequent to its creation. It could be hangin g in midair without any purpose or any way to get rid of it without causing major embarrass- ment to possibly innocent parties. Given the powerful cont ent of the briefing paper, it became imperative to establish its genuine ness or falsity as firmly as possible. It was to th is purpose that in th e summer of 1988 the Fund for UFO Research, Inc., em barked upon a su ccessful cam- paign to raise $16,000 to suppor t the proposal from Stanton Friedman to investigate the Ma jestic-12 documents (by then there were more than one), with the goal of establishing their basic nature. Analyzing the primary documen t presented Friedman with several major problems, some of which were the result of his inability to work with the orig inal document. Only a photo- graphic copy was available, and so there was no way to test the paper, the ink or any other physical characteristic. To com- pound the problem, Moore and Sh andera were unwilling to make the photographic negatives of the document available for study, though it is doubtf ul that much could have been learned from them. The starting point had to be the best possible copy of the prints made from the negatives—a third-generation version of the original, unfortunately. But the content of the paper could be read with ease, and so this was the closest approximation of original evidence that could be acquired. The format of the briefing pape r got considerable attention. Was it reasonable for the time (1 952) and for such a high-level document allegedly prepared for the White House? Were there any serious discrepancies fro m known practices? Was it the sort of thing that might be exp ected to have been created under the circumstances? In a letter to private UFO en thusiast Lee Graham, former CIA official Richard Bissell, w ho headed up the U-2 and Bay of Pigs operations, said: \"The doc ument certainly looks authen- tic. On the basis of the material you have sent me, I personally"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"60 C RASH AT C ORONA have little doubt that it is auth entic.\" Similar testimonials to the apparent authenticity of the Eisenhower briefing paper have been received by Friedman from Truman administrative assistant David Stowe and fro m one-time National Security Council planning board member Ro bert R. Bowie. (The docu- ment appears in the Appendices.) (In this book that page is pulled out) The date format in the midd le of the cover sheet also got great attention: 18 November, 1952. Is it correct to have a comma between the mont h and the year, or is this evidence of fraud? Present government pract ice dictates no comma, but in the early 1950s there were many di fferent date formats in use within the White Hous e. Several like the one in question have been found on official presidenti al documents and related pa- pers whose authenticity has never been questioned. Only when computers and word pro cessors came into common use did date format became consis tent. Moreover, a sophisticated hoaxer would probably have used a more common style in order not to draw attention to the date format. The security classification: TOP SECRET/MAJIC National Security Information Eyes Only . Does it make sense? The only unfamiliar word is MAJIC, which can be assumed to be a code word that limits access to persons cleared sp ecifically for infor- mation on this subject. This means that only those few individ- uals having a specif ic \"need to know\" a bout MJ-12 would be allowed to read it, rather than anyone cl eared for top secret, which runs to many hundreds of thousands of employees of the military, other government agen cies, and private contractors engaged in sensitive work. Regarding the writing style of the entire document: Does it fit other material know n to have been writte n by Adm. Roscoe Hillenkoetter, who is identified on page two as the briefing officer? Actually, th ere is no reason it should, as there is no evidence that it was written personally by Hillenkoetter, who could easily have roughed it out and then given it to someone else for final writing. In that case, it would not have repre- sented the writing style of Hillenkoetter; yet it would be an accurate statement of his position."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"M AJESTIC -12 61 However, in order to determin e if the briefing paper fit Hillenkoetter's style, it was pr esented to world-famous lin- guistics expert Dr. Roger W Wesc ott, of Drew University in New Jersey, along with more than twenty examples of notes and memos known to have be en written by Hillenkoetter. After studying them, Wescott wrot e: \"In my opinion, there is no compelling reason to regard any of these communications as fraudulent or to believe that any of them were written by anyone other than Hillenkoetter himself. This statement holds for the controversial pres idential briefing memorandum of November 18, 1952, as well as for the letters, both official and personal.\" This, of course, does not prov e that the Eise nhower briefing paper was written by Admiral Hillenkoetter. It only means that an expert found no evidence of fraud. Even if there were evidence that it was not written by Hillenkoetter, this would not necessarily mean it was a fake, only that the text was not prepared directly by him. It is certainly possible that an inspec- tion of the original document would produce evid ence of the use of modern paper or ink ... or that it would pr oduce evi- dence of the use of paper and ink appropriate to 1952. These matters remain unsettled. It has been suggested that listing Admiral Hillenkoetter as Roscoe rather than by his initia ls, R. H., is strong evidence (some actually insist it is proof) the paper is a fake because he is said to have hated that name and always used his initials. Testimony by his widow and by close friends agrees that he frequently used \"Rosco e\" and in fact wa s generally known by that name. The content of the briefing pa per offers th e greatest oppor- tunity for checking, and that is where most of the effort has gone, starting with the members of the Majestic -12 group.

These men represented the very cream of the American military, intelligence, and scientific communities in the sum- mer of 1947. All were perfectly logical and obvi ous choices for such an unusual and important project. All, that is, except for Donald Menzel, best known for three books in which he ridi- culed UFOs and those who took them seriously. He was recog- nized as the leading anti-UFO sp okesman of American science and as such influenced a generation of opinion-makers. Menzel's involvement with su ch a government operation had never been hinted at duri ng his many years of anti-UFO tirades. Was his inclusion in th e MJ-12 group a slip-up on the part of some unknown and possi bly playful hoaxer? Or were there things about Donald Menzel not generally known? Extensive research by Stanton Friedman in previously un- touched and hard-to-get-to Menzel papers at Harvard revealed an entire \"second life\" for the nationally known scientist. He had been deeply involved in hi gh-level covert CIA and National Security Agency operations fo r many years, including work in the code-breaking field and many other highly classified as- signments never suspected even by his widow and his closest associates at Harvard. But t hose who knew him best agreed that he was fully capable of keeping secrets—he would actu- ally have enjoyed lead ing a double li fe—and so could well have been involved in all sorts of \"black\" activities. He kept all"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"64 C RASH AT C ORONA knowledge of this to himself even during the McCarthy-style loyalty/security hearin gs in 1950 which threatened to remove his Air Force Secret clearance fo r having led a scie ntific expedi- tion to the U.S.S.R. in 1936—ev en though he had a rare Top Secret-Ultra clearance th at far superseded it. Of particular interest is the ef fort demanded of Friedman to acquire this previously unknown information. It required per- mission from two Harvard department heads and Mrs. Menzel. If the hoax had been perpetrate d by someone within the gov- ernment, it would have to have been by someone with access to the most sensitive information. Not impossible, but highly unlikely, and thus evidence of the great and unexplained im- portance of such a hoax. While the members of the MJ-12 group were the sort deserv- ing of being on such a panel, did they behave as if they really were involved in this? Stanton Friedman tracked them down (the last of the twelve to di e was Jerome Hu nsaker—in 1984, shortly before the Eisenhower br iefing paper surfaced) through telephone and appointment logs, an d personal and official cor- respondence found in their papers in presidential libraries and the documents division of the Li brary of Congress. Their com- ings and goings, their meetings and conferences could be traced on certain significant dates. One of the attachme nts to the Eisenhower briefing paper— the only one that accompani ed the document—is a memo from President Truman to Secretary of Defense Forrestal dated September 24, 1947, telli ng Forrestal of the establish- ment of MJ-12 and referring to a recent conversation between the two of them on this matter. September 24 was the only day between May and December 1947 on which Truman and Vannevar Bush met, and thus was the likely time for the decision to create MJ-12. Bush and Forrestal, the two men credited in the briefing pape r as having recommended the establishment of MJ-12, met on that day as well and saw Truman together. No prankste r could possibly have known this: it took Friedman many, many hours and thousands of miles of travel to discover these facts."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"M AJESTIC -12 65 In addition, September 2 was the day after Gen. Nathan Twining wrote his report on wh at was known about the flight characteristics of \"flying saucer s.\" What better time to take action by establishing a formal group to investigate sighting reports as well as crashes? Twining, acc ording to his and his pilot's flight logs had flown to Alamagor do Army Air Field, New Mexico, on July 7, 1947, re maining in the state (with a side trip to Kirtland Air For ce Base, Albuquerque) until July 11 before returning to Wright Field. In a July 17 letter to an execu- tive of the Boeing Ai rplane Co. Twining wr ote: \"With deepest regrets we had to cancel our trip to the Boeing factory due to a very important and sudden matter th t developed here.\" Could he have been in New Mexico in connection with the crash? C ONTENT OF THE E ISENHOWER B RIEFING P APER Since there is obviously reason to believe (t hough perhaps not to accept completely) that the document is real, its content assumes considerable potential im portance. If it fits what is known and what is reasonable, th e chances of it s legitimacy improve, as does its significance. The first paragraph of the text of the briefing paper describes the UFO situation prior to the Ne w Mexico crash and fits what has long been known abou t the first rash of American \"flying saucer\" sightings in late June and early July 1947. But one has to wonder about the basis for the statement \"Public reaction bordered on near hysteria at tim es.\" Most people reacted to the reports of sauc er-shaped things scooti ng across the sky with laughter, not with hysteria or even near-hysteria. Perhaps someone was trying to take credit for preventing a panic within the government, if not out in public. Other statements in the firs t paragraph refer to alleged events that are even less well known. If there were \"indepen- dent efforts by several different elements of th e military to ascertain the nature and purpose of these obj ects in the inter- ests of national defense,\" only that by the Air Materiel Com- mand has ever been mentioned before. Who else was so"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"66 C RASH AT C ORONA concerned about the reports? The navy? The marines? The cavalry? Or maybe other groups within the USAAF? Also, what is behind the words \"the re were severa l unsuccessful attempts to utilize aircraft in ef forts to pursue reported discs in flight\"? Attempts to intercept UFOs in the early days have never been made public, though they make sense, and the classic bureaucratese in which this was written suggests its author had spent considerab le time in the government. The second paragraph refers to the discovery of a crashed saucer on a remote ranch in New Mexico and fits very neatly with what has been l earned from other sources. The third paragraph continues to fit the increasingly com- plete knowledge of the aftermat h of the discovery of the wreckage. That a secret operatio n to recover the wreckage was begun on July 7 or 8 is well esta blished. And the finding of the bodies of several \"small human -like beings\" some distance from the Brazel ranch fits with what is now known of the claims of several witnesses. The length of time the bodies were said to have lain out in the open conforms to the latest chronology of the crash: \"ap- proximately one week\" is the tim e between the crash on July 2 and the most likely day of the discovery of the bodies by the main military search team involve d in the recovery. It is rea- sonable that the bodi es had by then undergone considerable decomposition by the elements, and perhaps further damage by predators. Removal of the bodies and wrec kage can be traced to some extent, though evidence that wr eckage was \"removed to sev- eral different locations\" has onl y recently come to light. The \"debriefing\" of civilian and mil itary witnesses is hardly sur- prising, especially in light of the testimony that rancher Brazel was held incommunica do by the army for a week, during and after which he \"agreed\" with them that the wreckage was mundane. The \"weather balloon\" cover story has been testified to by several ex-military people who have since admitted to being aware that it was phony. Page four concerns highly clas sified efforts to learn the na-"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"M AJESTIC -12 67 ture of the wreckage and bodies, all of which is perfectly logi- cal, but never detailed until the briefing pape r was leaked. It is interesting that Dr. Menzel is mentioned as having been in- volved in the question of the orig in of the craft (as an astro- physicist, he would be the first choice) but not in the attempt to decipher the symbols found on parts of the wreckage. His knowledge of cryptanaly sis and of Japanese, a symbolic lan- guage, should have made him an obvious choice for this diffi- cult task. The confusion at finding no evidence of metal wiring, which was the only known form of elec trical connection and trans- mission in 1947, is understand able. Solid-state electronics arose after the crashes, with the la te-1947 invention of the transistor. That this now-common device might have resulted from study of the wreckage has been suggested by scientists with knowledge of these events, and the plausibility of this connection is supported by histories of science that point to the relatively sudden invention of the transistor shortly after the date of the crashes. On page five, the briefing goe s into the formation of an official government UFO inve stigation—ini tially Project Sign—though its suggested purpose was to pass along informa- tion about UFOs, their performan ce, and their functions to MJ-12, rather than to determine if they were a threat to the national security, as the public wa s repeatedly told. To do this, a secret liaison system was se t up between the project and MJ-12, using a \"mole\" in the i nvestigation who often, if not always, was the project directo r. While no mention of this is made in any of form er project director Ed Ruppelt's writings, his orders could easily have been too hi ghly classified to per- mit that, and he may not have known exactly where his infor- mation was going, or why. The discovery of a second cr ashed object on December 6, 1950, fits what is known abou t some very mysterious activ- ities around that time. A high stat e of alert was noted in several books about the Truman admini stration, Truman's memoirs and papers in his library, and even an FBI teletype message"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"68 C RASH AT C ORONA about an Army Intelligence al ert for \"any data whatsoever concerning flying saucer s.\" This reported cr ash has yet to be properly investigated by private UFO groups. The final paragraph on page five mentions the increased level of UFO activity in th e spring and summer of 1952—the huge sighting wave cen tered on Washington, D.C. However, the activity had returned to normal levels (four to five per week) well before the briefing paper wa s delivered, and so the obvious concern is a sign that the Penta gon was highly disturbed by the flap. Hence it is pointed to as th e basis for increa sed security in order to prevent panic, as well as for unspecified \"international and technological considerations .\" A contingency plan dated January 31, 1949 (a year and a ha lf after the crash), was put in place \"should the need to make a public announ cement present itself.\" Just what would constitu te justification for a public release of information is not even hinted at , though one can guess that a landing or a cr ash observed by many people (or even TV cameras) migh t be the sort of event that would over- ride all plans for keep ing the news under wraps. The seven attachments not incl uded with the leaked docu- ment (or made available later by the high-level informants of Moore and Shandera) must contai n a world of vital informa- tion. They cover such matters as the analyses of the wreckage, bodies and symbols. R ELATED D OCUMENTS Easily the most controversial of all the MJ-12-related mate- rials is usually referred to as the Cutler-Twining memo. It allegedly was sent fr om Robert Cutler, a special assistant to President Eisenhower, to Lt. Gen. Nathan Twining. It appears to concern the resche duling of a Majestic -12 Special Studies Project (MJ-12 SSP) meeting on July 16, 1954. The controversy re volves around the mann er in which the document was discovered. Willia m Moore and Jaime Shandera found it in 1985 while searchin g through more than a hundred boxes of recently declassified documents in Records Group 341 (RG 341) at the National Arch ives in Washington. The memo"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"M AJESTIC -12 69 was found between two folders a nd is a White House document completely unrelated to RG 341, which is composed of Air Force material. It was found in box number 189, which had been hinted at in a myster ious postcard received by Moore from New Zealand with a return address of Box 189, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, though the signi ficance of the box number did not register until after the fact. It would appear that the Cutler-Twining memo was planted in RG 341, Box 189. by someone w ho wanted it to be found. But who planted it is unknown, sinc e the only people with access to the material were National Archives employees and the Air Force people who declassified th e thousands of pages in RG 341. It is highl y unlikely that anyone else could have done it, as the means of access to such material is ca refully controlled by the security-conscious Na tional Archives staff. The memo is obviously a carbon co py, on a type of onionskin paper manufactured in limited and controlled quantities be- tween 1953 and the early 1970s, a nd is discolored around the edges as would be expect ed of an old piece of paper. The lack of Cutler's signature has been the ta rget of attacks on the validity of the memo. There isn't even a typed \"/s/,\" which would indicate that the original was signed. Investig ation by Fried- man revealed that Robe rt Cutler was out of the country on the day the memo was written, so an aide must have prepared it— as aides prepared many other memos and letters in those days. The lack of a signatur e therefore is not evid ence of its fabrica- tion; indeed, had it carried a si gnature when Cutler was away, there would be solid re ason to be suspicious. A July 3, 1954, memo was found by Friedm an at the Eisen- hower Library in which Cutler in structed James Lay, executive secretary of the National Securi ty Council, to \"Keep things moving out of my basket.\" Anot her memo, written on July 16, reveals Lay telling Cutler: \"Hope you will recuperate, rest and enjoy yourself for the da ys before returning. Will try to have everything tidy and not too much pressure on you when you arrive.\" Clearly, Lay was taking care of routine matters during Cutler's absence.

One possible explanatio n for this is that the briefing paper could be a copy of most of the original, with the copier omit- ting any reference to the second cr ash because, at the time, this had been given only limited cred ence.

He wanted to show it to us and wanted us to go down and see the rest of the debris or whatever, [ but] we didn't on account of the transporta- tion and everything wasn't too go od. He didn't get anybody to come out who was interested in it. The piece he brought looked like a kind of tan, light-brown plas tic . . . it was very lightweight, like balsa wood. It wasn't a large piece, maybe about four inches long, maybe just a little larger than a pencil. We cut on it with a knife and wo uld hold a match on it, and it wouldn't burn. We knew it wasn't wood. It was smooth like plastic, it didn't have real sharp corners, kind of like a dowel stick. Kind of dark tan. It didn't have any gr ain ... just smooth. I hadn't seen anything like it.

Th e sheriff quickly realized it was something unusual and calle d Roswell Army Air Field and talked with Major Je sse Marcel, the intellig ence officer.

Frank Joyce of radio stati on KGFL got a phone call while on duty at the station one afternoon from a man who reported wreckage on his ranch—presum ably Mac Brazel. He asked me what to do about it. I recommended he go to Roswell Army Air Base [sic]. The next thing I heard was that the PIO, [Lt.] Walter Haut, came into the station some time after I got this call. He handed me a news release printed on onionskin stationary and left im- mediately.

Then the phone calls started coming on, a nd I referred them to [the air- field]. Then the wire stopped and ju st hummed.

Typing came across: \"This is the FBI, you will cease transmitting.\" I had my shorthand pa d, and I turn ed around and told [Karl] that I had been cut off, but that I could take it in shorthand and then we could call it in to the network. I took it in shorthand, as John went on to give the story. He had seen them take the thing away ... he'd been out there [p resumably at the Foster ranch] when they took it away.

But once the news got out, the reaction of the nation's and even the world's press was rapid. For two weeks, it had been full of tales of \"routine\" flyovers of vaguely described shiny discs and sil- very balls. And so this offbeat st ory of the recovery of actual pieces of one of the things was played for all it was worth. Suddenly, Roswell, New Mexico, was on the map. The sleepy little Western town, whose main cl aim to fame as the home of the A-bomb-carrying 509 th Bomb Group had long been stifled by military security, was instan tly transformed into the world center of ... something. Phone calls from reporters as far away as London poured into the sheriff' s office, the radio stations, newspapers, and of course Roswell Army Air Field. The city fathers reveled in all the atten tion, while the military shud- dered. Everyone wanted to know mo re about this earthshaking event: Exactly what was found at the ranch? What was it like? What had been done with it? Co uld we see it? And especially, was it really the remains of one of those mysterious flying discs? The afternoon edition of the July 9 Roswell Daily Record, which was written well after the mystery had supposedly been solved by the Eighth Air Force, expressed a popular feeling about the episode w ith this editorial: AND NOW WHAT IS IT? With telephones ringing, excite d voices shouti ng into news- room personnel ears, pouring out eager questions which were unanswerable, it was discovered shortly after publication time of the Record yesterday afternoon that curiosity over the reports from 44 states of the un ion that silver discs had crystallized into belief. The Record had no more than \"hit the streets\" until the tele- phone barrage began, with questi oners checking up on what they had just read, doubtful of their own eyes. But the story stood, just as all amazing things stand in these days of wonderful feats and curious performances."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"C IVILIANS F IND THE W RECKAGE 79 What the disk is is another ma tter. The Army isn't telling its secrets yet, from all appearance s when this was written. Maybe it's a fluke and maybe it isn't. An yone's guess is pretty good at the moment. Maybe the thing is still a hoax, as has been the be lief of most folks from the start. But something has been found. The announcement from Eighth Air Force Headquarters by General Ramey that the flying disc was just the radar reflector from a weather ballo on effectively killed the story. Most people—especially those in military-dominat ed areas like New Mexico—were in awe of the government and eager to accept its words. If the USAAF said it was a radar reflector, then who was to disagree? After all, hadn't some of those men carried us to glorious victory in World War II just two years earlier? But a lot of people knew the wr eckage was not part of any weather balloon, or anything else familiar. Some were civil- ians, not under military contro l, who could legally spill the beans and leave the government in a very awkward position. Of the newsmen who had seen and probably handled pieces of wreckage obviously unrelated to balloons, all were employees of radio stations. Thinly veiled telephone threats from Wash- ington, aimed at convincing them their station's FCC licenses were in jeopardy if they ever spoke out, worked as planned. Other threats came from what wi tnesses recall as the office of New Mexico Senator Dennis Chavez, and former Senator and current Secretary of Agricultu re Clinton A. Anderson. While similar extralegal behavior on the part of government officials in the 1990s could well produ ce the opposite result, in 1947 Washington was able to exercise frightening power over a sup- posedly free, independent press. Rancher Mac Brazel a nd his family were neither in the em- ploy of the government nor in need of government approval to work.

It can be assumed that some combinati on of threats, bribes, and ap-"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"80 C RASH AT C ORONA peals to his patriotism did the trick. He was seen on the streets of Roswell several times during his period of military deten- tion and shocked old friends by completely ignoring them when he passed by. On July 10 Mac was escorted to the office of the Roswell Daily Record by KGFL owner Walt Wh itmore and gave the newspaper for publication an in terview that bore little sim- ilarity to his original story: Brazel stated that on June 14 he and an 8-year old son, Vernon, were about 7 or 8 miles from the ranch house of the J. B. Foster ranch, which he operates, when th ey came upon a large area of bright wreckage made up of rubber strips, tinfoil, a rather tough paper and sticks. At the time Brazel was in a hurry to get his round made and he did not pay much attention to it. But he did remark about what he had seen and on July 4 he, his wife, Vernon and a daughter Betty, age 14, went back to the spot and gathered up quite a bit of the debris. The next day he first heard ab out the flying disks, and he wondered if what he had found might be the remnants of one of these. Monday he came to town to sell some wool and while here he went to see sheriff George Wilc ox and \"whispered kinda confi- dential like\" that he might have found a flying disc. Wilcox got in touch with the Ro swell Army Air Field and Maj. Jesse A. Marcel and a man in plain clothes accompanied him home, where they picked up the rest of the pieces of the \"disc\" and went to his home to try to reconstruct it. According to Brazel they simply could not reconstruct it at all. They tried to make a kite out if it, but could not do that and could not find any way to put it b ack together so that it would fit. Then Major Marcel brought it to Roswell and that was the last he heard of it until the story broke that he had found a flying disk. Brazel said that he did not see it fall from the sky and did not see it before it was torn up, so he did not know the size or shape it might have been, but he thought it might have been about as large as a table top. The balloon which held it up, if that was how"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"C IVILIANS F IND THE W RECKAGE 81 it worked, must have been about 12 feet long, he felt, measuring the distance by the size of the room in which he sat. The rubber was smoky gray in color and scat tered over an area about 200 yards in diameter. When the debris was gathered up the tinfoil, pa per, tape, and sticks made a bundle about thre e feet long and 7 or 8 inches thick, while the rubber made a bundle about 18 or 20 inches long and about 8 inches thick. In all, he estimated, the entire lot would have weighed maybe five pounds. There was no sign of any metal in the area wh ich might have been used for an engine and no sign of any propellers of any kind, although at least one paper fin ha d been glued onto some of the tinfoil. There were no words to be found anywhere on the instrument, although there were letters on so me of the parts. Considerable Scotch tape and some tape with flowers printed upon it had been used in the construction. No strings or wires were to be found but there were some eyelets in the paper to indicate that some sort of attachment may have been used. Brazel said that he had previ ously found two weather observa- tion balloons on the ranch, but that what he found this time did not in any way resemble any of these [emphasis added]. \"I am sure what I found wa s not any weather observation balloon,\" he said. \"But if I find anything else beside a bomb they are going to have a hard ti me getting me to say anything about it.\" Firsthand witnesses ag ree that Brazel seem ed \"not himself\" at the newspaper and when being escorted around town by military people. But even if he had been, his wo rds should have raised a lot of eyebrows ar ound Roswell, though they were given no exposure elsewhere. Mac makes clear that he was fa miliar with weather balloons and that what he found was not a weather balloon! He saw the wreckage on the ranch, while General Ramey and company did not. Who was better qualified to de scribe and identify it? Brazel also said there were no words on it, even though weather bal- loons are well marked with th e owner's name and address so"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"82 C RASH AT C ORONA they can be returned for a smal l reward. But he did say there were letters on some of the part s, which obviously could not be fitted together to form any words. Weighing heavily against the scattered wreckage being any sort of balloon was its condition: Pieces we re spread out over an area of more than 250,000 squa re feet (\"200 yards in diame- ter\"). A helium-filled ba lloon cannot explode , nor can it hit the ground in such a way that it will be shattered into a lot of pieces. And even if it had, there would hardly have been enough of it to attract atte ntion when spread out over an area the size of several football fields. And if that isn't enough to make it obvious that what Brazel found was not related to the balloon he described, recall that he said there was \"a large area of bright wrecka ge made up of rubber strips, tinfoil, a rather tough paper and sticks.\" Tinfoil certainly can be bright and ey e-catching, but the same cannot be said for smokey gray rubber, tough paper, and sticks. And if he could bundle all of it up in a couple of sma ll packages, why did the two vehicles of Marcel and Cavitt hold but a small portion of the total they found? Mu ch of the rest of the story told by Mac Brazel on July 10 was totally at odds with what he said before and what has subsequently been well checked out: dates, places, and of course the description of the various types of debris. While no proof has been found that the govern ment bribed Brazel to change his story and th en keep quiet, there is evi- dence pointing in that direction. In the words of Loretta Proc- tor, nearest nei ghbor to the ranch: \"I think that within that year, he had moved off the ranch and moved to Alamagordo or to Tu larosa and he put in a locker there. That was before people had home freezers, and it was a large refrigerated building... you would buy beef and cut it up and put it in those lockers and you had a key to it and you could get your beef out when you wanted it. I think it would have been pretty expensive, and we kind of wondered how he could put it in with rancher's wages.\" Did Mac Brazel see alien bodies in the aftermath of the crash"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"C IVILIANS F IND THE W RECKAGE 83 near Corona? He cert ainly never claimed to have seen bodies, but circumstantial ev idence suggests he pr obably saw at least one, as well as a lot of wreckage. Had Mac seen nothing more than the sort of scrap material recovered from the sheep ranch by Major Marcel and CICman Cavitt (when accompanied by Brazel ), there would hardly have been any need for the army to take such extreme action against him. Why take him into custody for a week and then possibly bribe him to keep quiet about matters which do not seem that serious? He was already on record as having seen a large quan- tity of scrap material and, wh ile escorted by soldiers, gave a newspaper interview in which he stated clearly that the wreckage was not that of a weather balloon. Why did the army give him such special treatment if all he knew was common know ledge already? That little cat was out of the bag, leaving no obvious reason for the army to exert unusual pressure on Mac to change his behavior. It seems entirely possible that he could have be en flown over the ranch, which stretched for miles, on a reconnaissance mis- sion, as he knew the land far bette r than the army did. He could thus have been involved in the di scovery of the main part of the craft, which is rumored to ha ve landed some two and a half miles from the field of debris. Had he been in a small plane, such as one of the army's fo ur-passenger Stinson L-5 liaison planes capable of operating off rough gr ound, he could have seen the disc on the ground. If the information given civilia n mortician Glenn Dennis by the Roswell AAF mortuary offi cer (see Chapter 9)—that the bodies were found a mile or two from the crashed craft—is correct, their discover y from the air makes sense. Moreover, if what the nurse told Dennis is accurate (that the bodies were found in small \"escape capsules\" su ch as he saw in the rear of some GI ambulances) they probabl y could not have been recog- nized for what they were fr om the air.

Ac cording to his son, Bill Jr., Mac never felt like he had done anythi ng special. He rode out, found a lot of odd-looking stuff and ev entually to ld the government. In the words of the son: My Dad found this thing and he told me a little bit about it ... not much .. . because the Air Force asked him to take an oath that he wouldn't tell anybody in de tail about it. He went to his grave and he never told anybody. He was an oldtime Western cowboy, and they didn't do a lot of talkin'. My brother and I had just went through World War II (him in the Army and me in the Navy) and needless to say, my Dad was proud. Like he told me, \"When you guys went in the service, you took an oath, and I took an oath not to tell.\" The only thing he said was, 'Well, there's a big bunc h of stuff, there's some tinfoil, some wood, and on some of that wood there was Japanese or Chinese figures.\" Had that been all Mac saw, th ere would certainly have been no need for the army to make hi m take an oath not to talk. Not to talk about things that were already public! Clearly, more was involved, and that could have been bodies. Bill Jr. was living and worki ng in Albuquerque, more than seventy-five miles to the northwe st of the ranch, but returned when he realized his father had been taken into custody by the army and thus there was no one to run the ranch: I rode out there [the field wh ere the debris was found] on the average of once a week, and I was riding through that area, I was lookin'. That's why I found those little pieces. Not over a dozen pieces—I'd say maybe eight different pieces—but there was only thr ee [different] items involved: somethin' on the order of balsa wood, something on the order of heavy-gauge monofilament fishing line, and a little piece of—it wasn't tinfoil, it wasn't lead fo il—a piece about the size of my finger.

I couldn't whittle it with my pocket knife. The \"string,\" I couldn't break it. The only reason I noticed the tinfoil (I'm gonna call it tinfoil), I picked this stuff up and put it in my chaps pocket. Might be two or three days or a week before I took it out and put it in a ciga r box. I happened to notice when I put that piece of foil in that box , and the damn th ing just started unfolding and just flattened out! Then I got to playin' with it. I'd fold it, crease it, lay it down a nd it'd unfold. It's kinda weird. I couldn't tear it. The color was in between tinfoil and lead foil, about the [thickness ] of lead foil. I was in Corona, in the bar, th e pool hall—sort of the meeting place—domino parlor. . .. That's where everybody got together. Everybody was askin'... they'd seen the papers (t his was about a month after the crash) and I said, \"Oh, I picked up a few little bits and pieces and fragments.\" S o, what are they? \"I dunno.\" Then, lo and behold, here comes the military (out to the ranch, a day or two later). I'm almost positive that the officer in charge, his name was Armstrong, a real nice guy. He had a [black] ser- geant with him that was real ni ce. I think there was two other enlisted men. They sa id, \"We understand your father found this weather balloon.\" I said, \"Well, yeah!\" 'And we understand you found some bits and pieces.\" I sa id, \"Yeah, I've got a cigar box that's got a few of 'em in ther e, down at the saddle shed.\" And this (I think he was a captain), and he said, \"Well, we would like to take it with us.\" I said, \"Well.. ..\" And he smiled and he said, \"Your father turned the rest of it over to us, and you know he's under an oa th not to tell. Well, \" he said, \"we came after those bits and pieces.\" And I kind of smiled and said, \"OK, you can have the stuff, I ha ve no use for it at all.\" He said, \"Well, have you exam ined it?\" And I said, \"Well, enough to know that I don't know what the hell it is!\" And he said, \"We would rather you didn 't talk very much about it.\" Once again, the military's behavior contradicted its claims that nothing of consequence ha ppened at the sheep ranch. Once again, the military's preo ccupation with security suc- ceeded in attracting attention to something that might other- wise have gone unnoticed."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"86 C RASH AT C ORONA Bill Brazel Jr.'s memory of hi s limited personal involvement in the Corona crash is clear and sharp. Though he appears, sitting quietly in his simple home, to be a man uninterested in the world beyond the s cenic, sparsely populated land of his origins, his duties in the na vy and later with a geophysical exploration firm took him around the world twice. His days of travel and adventure may be behi nd him, but his awareness of the world remains. As does hi s puzzlement at the behavior of the army so many years ago. He saw only a few sm all pieces of the debr is that fell on the Foster ranch, yet the attitude of the military wh en it came to retrieve it convinced him that what fell there was no weather balloon.

He was a man who had integrity. He definitely felt insulted and mis-used, and disrespected. He was worse than annoyed! He was definitely under some stre ss, and felt that he had been kicked around. \"He was threatened that if he opened his mouth, he might get thrown in the back side of th e jail. He gave that impression, definitely.\" All this because a ranch foreman saw some shapeless pieces of scrap material? In all probab ility, there was more to it. While no direct testimony exists that M ac saw bodies, the behavior of the military points in that direction. * * *"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"C IVILIANS F IND THE W RECKAGE 87 At about the same time something eerie happened on the ranch southeast of Corona, somethi ng even stranger happened 150 miles to the west. Of the ten or twelve civilians who reportedly saw the second crashed UFO before the military arrived, only two have been willing to talk (o ne of them has since died) and the others are still being sought. Supporti ng evidence consists of memories that something very unusual ha ppened there: numerous recollections, but few containing specifics. The first clue that anything at all had occurred in western New Mexico came from Vern Maltais, whose close friend, Grady \"Barney\" Barnett, descri bed the amazing scene to him. It was Maltais and his wife Jean who first told Stanton Fried- man about this after a lecture in Bemidji, Minnesota, in 1978. According to Maltais, Barnet t was working in western New Mexico as a field engineer for the U.S. Soil Conservation Ser- vice when he came upon a \"large metallic object \" stuck in the ground and a group of archaeo logists looking at it. As Vern Maltais recalls, Barnett \"noticed they were standing around looking at some dead bodi es that had fallen to the ground, I think there we re others in the machine, which was a kind of metallic inst rument of some sort—a kind of disc. It seemed to be made of stainle ss steel. The m achine had been split open by explosion or impact. \"They were like humans, but they were not humans. The heads were round, the eyes were small, a nd they had no hair. The eyes were oddly spaced. Th ey were quite small by our standards and their heads were larger in proportion to their bodies than ours. Their clothing seemed to be one piece, and gray in color. You couldn't se e any zippers, belts or buttons. They seemed to be all males a nd there were a number of them.\" This, of course, is no more than Vern Maltais' recollection of what Barney Barnett had told him several years before. These are not Barnett's actual words, as he died in 19 69 before anyone in the private UFO community had become aware of his in- volvement in the New Mexico crashes, before anyone had heard of a crash in western New Mexico, and before anyone was taking stories of crashes seriously."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"88 C RASH AT C ORONA It has been sugges ted, in the book The Roswell Incident and subsequently in UFO Crash at Roswell that Barnett stumbled upon the main part of the craft that had left its pieces on the Foster ranch near Corona, rather than another craft that had crashed well to the west. In th e absence of direct testimony from Barnett, all one has is se condhand informat ion, but it all points away from Corona. James Fleck Danley, Barney's bo ss, has made it clear that Barney's territory exte nded to the west of his office in Socorro, not to the north or east. A di ary kept by Barney's wife and provided by her niece, Alice Knig ht, shows that his field trips were to the west, the \"high co untry,\" to towns like Datil and Magdalena and to ranc hes in the area of the Plains of San Augustin. All of this is to the west, away from Corona. A former neighbor, Harold Baca, responding to a letter in the Socorro newspaper from Stanton Friedman seeking people who had known Barney, said Barney told him about the flying sau- cer that had crashed \"out in the Plains.\" An oldtime rancher on the Plains, the late Ma rvin Ake, told Stanto n Friedman that he had heard of a crashed saucer story \"out on the Plains.\" A retired postmistress from Datil told Friedman of a crashed saucer \"out on the Plains\" that had been brought out through Magdalena at night. As additional support for the contention that Barnett had indeed encountered a crashed sa ucer and alien bodies is the testimony of William Leed, a career military officer. In a recent conversation, Leed told Friedm an that in the early 1960s he was advised by a colonel familiar with his interest in UFOs to talk to a man who had touched one: \"Barney Barnett.\" Leed, when in the Southwest, made a sp ecial side trip to see Barnett. Although Leed was there as a pr ivate citizen, Barnett asked for his military credentials . Leed was then told of Barney's walk- ing up to the crashed craft and seeing alien bodies, and of his interrogation by military people on at least three occasions, and the strong suggesti on that he not talk about his experience. Leed said he had no reason to think Barnett was telling him anything but the truth."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"C IVILIANS F IND THE W RECKAGE 89 Despite heroic efforts to find additional witnesses, little more was learned about the San Agustin crash for a decade. Then, in response to the imme nsely popular January 1990 Unsolved Mysteries telecast about the Co rona crash, a man named Gerald Anderson called the producer to announce he had more information that might be of interest. The message was passed along to both Kevin Randle and Stanton Friedman, who had worked on the show a nd who were busily trying to chase down other leads to the crash stories. A personality conflict between Anderson and Randle cut that relationship short, but the new witness hit it off much bette r with Fried- man, who taped a long telephone interview and began a long and complicated series of maneuve rs aimed at getting a copy of a personal journal allegedly kept by Anderson's late Uncle Ted. In late 1990, Anderson and the auth ors traveled to the Plains of San Agustin to see if Jerry could relive his experiences of forty- three years earlier. Brought to the area by helicopter, Jerry jumped out as soon as it touched down and raced to wh at he thought was the very place he had seen the wrecked craft and its crew of small humanoids. His undis guised excitement created an atmo- sphere of authenticity, as he la ter led the others to significant locations, pointing, gesturing, and exclaiming as he went. Ev- erything suggested that he had finally returned to the place where something traumatic had happened to a six-year-old who now, standing six- four and carrying a muscular 250-plus pounds, resembled an offensive guard. The Plains of San Agustin is a vast level area in western New Mexico that was once a great lake providi ng water for prehis- toric tribes, and more recently their ancient artifact s for arche- ologists. On the southeast side is Bat Cave, famous as the site of the discovery of kernels of corn said to be at least forty-five hundred years old and the remn ants of the earliest known agriculture in North America. The Plains are about seven thousand feet above sea level and are surr ounded by peaks of the Tularosa, Black, and Da til Mountains reaching up to ninety-five hundred feet.

Bu t in 1947, there were no radio telescopes. Just m ountains, crude roads, the occa- sional rustic ranchhouse, the flatness of the plains, and the rocky peaks. The Continental Divide, spine of the Rocky Mountains, runs just to the west. And less than a hundred miles to the east sits Trinity Site, where the world's first atomic bomb was tested in 19 45. The Plains are sixty miles long and ten to fifteen miles wi de, steeped in traditions both old and new. It was to this area, with the intention of hunting a type of rock called moss agate, that you ng Gerald Anderson came with his older brother Glenn, his unc le Ted, his father, and his cousin Victor on a very hot, hum id morning in ear ly July 1947. Jerry and his immediate family had just moved to Albuquerque a few days before, a nd several of them ha d driven south with other relatives who had lived there much longer. At midmorn- ing, the group of men and boys parked their car after driving as far off the two-lane road as the terrain would permit.

I don't know why, I think it was on e airship I was familiar with, because back in that era they were quite large and quite awe- some. I kinda had a \"thing\" about blimps. We headed straight toward it, and there was one point when we got up close to it, my Dad told me to stay back. Fifty to sixty feet: we were practically on top of it. There was a big gouge mark where it had cut a big furrow acro ss the arroyo from another hill on the other side. It tore up a lo t of the sagebrush and there was small fires smolderi ng here and there. That's when my brother said, \"That's a goddamn spaceship! Them's Martians!\" Then everyone was runnin' around in circles. I didn't stay put—I think I was scared—I went over there with 'em. And there were three of these crewmember s laid out on the ground, under the edge of this thing, in a shad ed area, and ther e was one sitting upright. The ones that were la ying on the ground, two of 'em weren't moving at all, they were just laying there. They looked like they had some sort of bandages on 'em. One of them had it over his arm. The one that I touched had it around his midsection and partiall y over his shoulder. It ap- peared to be, as I think back on it now, the one that was still alive and moving had gi ven first aid to the others. And the one next to him was breathing very erratically and its chest was heaving in an unnatural way. He was obviously in distress . . . very badly so. The other two didn't move at all. The only one that really moved was the one that was sitting up, and it obviously was scared to death of us. It was sc ooting backward against the under- side of the saucer. It was obviously terrified of us. At first [the adults] just ki nd of oohed and ahhed around. My cousin Victor, as usual, was in to everything, in everybody's way. My brother, Glenn, was looking ov er the saucer-shaped object. He pulled Victor off it; Victor was up on the rim where the gash was, and he grabbed him by his le gs and pulled him off and told him to stay out of there because he could cause it to explode.

The odd part about it is, I've often wondered why the other one didn' t cover him up. We cover up dead humans because I think we're afraid to look at dead things. I think it's funny it didn't cover up its dead crew members like that. Unless that doesn't mean anything to 'em. See, I thought they were dolls. I didn't think they were real, even though I'd seen this one moving and reacting. I remember puttin g my hand against the side of the saucer, and it was cold, almost like it was refrigerated. Being out there in the sun and being real shiny, I pr obably expected it to be hot, but it wasn't. It was very cold! Like it was wintertime and you were touching something metal. And the area right next to it was very cool, compared to the other areas around [there]. The area around the spaceship was blazing hot. I re member the desert sun: It was unbelievably hot.

I didn't get as close as my Dad and my"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"C IVILIANS F IND THE W RECKAGE 93 uncle, 'cause they were kneeling, squatting down right next to it. At one point, my uncle Ted had reached out and touched it on the shoulder like he was trying to cons ole it. At that point it wasn't recoiling in fear anymore. I was very close to him when he did this ... about three feet away. Was it aware of your presence? It looked around at all of us. It was like it was trying to watch everybody at once. I think that might be one of the reasons that I picked up on it being afraid. It acted like a cat that was around kids. It just constantly watched everybody. It looked at me sev- eral times. It seemed very uneasy, even when it had calmed down to a certain degree. Why did you go around behind the craft? Because Glenn was around there . . . I went around to see where my brother was. My brother was up on the edge of this thing and he was looking inside that rip in the side. He cut himself on the side of his face, or nicked himsel f. And I went around to that side when he came out and I could see in there where he was at, because the saucer was tilted, the edge was tilted down and jammed in at that point. I coul d see directly into it, and was looking through the outer hull and into another bulkhead, and that bulkhead was shaped exactly like the outer hull. You could see through the rip, a nd you could see what looked like components (I don't know if they were electrica l, electronic, propulsion, or what). They were all seemingly hooked together by these cables—clusters of threadlike material in the form of a cable—and one of these was hanging out of th at rip. There were several hundred strands per one of these clusters, they were wrapped. They blew in the wind li ke a horse's tail, except there was lights all over th e ends of them. These lights were undulat- ing, they were flashing. Some of th em were bright, some of them were very dim, some of them we re flashing. They looked like fire on the ends of these threadlike things that were waving in the breeze. And you could see others of those went from one kind of"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"94 C RASH AT C ORONA package of components to another kind of package, kind of like they were cables of some kind . And down the center between these things—they were all in very neat litt le rows—there was, like, scribbling. [On] each one of these component boxes there would be scribbling, it was almo st a pink color on sort of a brown, woodlike background. Like it was writing or symbols that explained what this thing was. You could see some other lights in there. These lights were usually associated with component s. Some of them were going on and off. The light would go o ff over here, and the light over here would come on. It was like circuitry was still functioning, or attempting to function. There was some [that were] amber, and some green. Were they the same color as the lights on the threads that were hanging down? Some of that was really brillia nt red, and some of it was like brilliant white. Strobe-light bri ght. The others were red, they were incredibly brilliant colors and they were fading. Some of them would fade, they were very faint, and others were brilliant and real obvious. Some of them appeared to be fluctuating in intensity. . . getting real bright, and then dim, and then partially bright, and then real br ight, and then dim again. I never got up in that crack. Glenn [said] that it was very cold. I knew that, as I'd already touched that portion of the outer hull. How big was the gash? Eight to ten feet from bottom to top. It went almost from the edge of the saucer to the top of the dome. And probably in width: three feet. It was an elliptically shaped vertical gash, like a parenthesis. The widest part of it seemed to be toward the center. It looked like it had been pulled open and all the metal turned in, and it was very ripped and jagged. There was a real strong smell, too. Like, maybe, rubbing alco- hol or acetone or something like that. And this is what I think was prompting my Dad to jump on my brother's back constantly about his cigarettes, because he was afraid he was gonna blow the place up!"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"C IVILIANS F IND THE W RECKAGE 95 Right after that, these people ca me up the arro yo toward us from the opposite direction from where we had come. There was a man and five of hi s students—three gu ys and two girls— college-age students. They were in their late teens and twenties. The newcomers included five college students and their pro- fessor, Dr. Buskirk. They had been working on an archaeologi- cal dig near cliff dwellings a fe w miles away and had decided to hike over after seeing what they thought was a fiery meteor crashing the night before. When they arrived their reactions closely paralleled those of Jerry and his relatives: First with: \"I don't believe what I'm seeing!,\" and then with shock when they realized these weren't dolls, that these were live, but nobody knew what they were. And here's this funny craft, and Glenn and them was st ill talking about men from Mars and stuff like this. Dr. Buskirk apparently is capable of speaking several lan- guages, because he had tried to communicate with this creature. He knelt down there with Ted an d my Dad and tried to talk to this thing. I recognized one of the languages as German because I had German relatives that spoke German fluently. Ted was mar- ried to a Mexican woman and he spoke Spanish, so I understood that one. Of course, they got no response. I recall this Dr. Buskirk tried sign language, a nd there was ap parently no re sponse from that. And then another guy just show ed up suddenly. I had went up the bank and was standing there by the trees, right by the saucer on top of the rocks. And there was a guy with a pick-up [truck], and it was one of those old-model pick-ups and it had a whip antenna on it, like a police car has. He walk ed over there and he looked like Harry Truman: he had a real ruddy complex- ion, he wore glasses and he had sort of khaki work clothes on and he had a straw hat. Back in those days, even the little kids knew who Harry Truman was: He beat the Germans and the Japs! This guy looked like him, and he walked over there and he got to talkin' to Dr. Buskirk and Ted and my brother and my Dad, and he said that he had seen it from out on the Playa. He had"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"96 C RASH AT C ORONA apparently worked out there, a nd he acknowledged that he made maps or something like that. [It is assumed that this man was Barney Barnett.] At this point, with almost a dozen people swarming around the wrecked craft and the four strange little beings, the U.S. Army arrived and everything changed. The bulk of the de tail on the San Agus tin crash comes from one man who had been just a youngster at the time of the incident. Charges have been ma de that Gerald Anderson in- vented the story of seeing wreckage a nd bodies. In 1991 the Fund for UFO Research paid for a polygr aph examination of Anderson. The American Polygr aph Association was contacted and recommended a member in the area, a man named Robert Riggs—a professional polygrap h examiner for over ten years and himself a former policeman. Riggs first met alone with Fr iedman for over an hour to review the story and a whole host of possible ho ax scenarios. He then met with Anderson for more than two hours checking on all aspects of the story. Finally, he hook ed Gerald up to the machine and asked his key questio ns. At the end of this session Riggs informed Friedm an that he found no evidence of decep- tion or of pathology, and that Anderson had an outstanding memory. While no other firsth and witnesses have been found to cor- roborate Anderson's testimony, Fr iedman did find a member of his father's church w ho recalled overheari ng the father talking to two men about a flying disc and government people restrict- ing his access to it. (This conversation took place after Gerald's father had retired from his job at Sandia Corporation, where he had required a high-level securi ty clearance because of the company's nuclear weapons-re lated manufacturing activ- ities.) Psychiatric social worker John Carpenter, who trained at the Menninger Clinic, has worked wi th Gerald for more than a year. They have gone over and over the complicated story, at times using regressive hypnosis in an effort to bring out greater"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"C IVILIANS F IND THE W RECKAGE 97 detail and to search for any si gnificant inconsistencies. Car- penter is highly impressed by A nderson and is convinced he is telling the truth as he knows it. Carpenter sees no basis for challenging Anderson's honesty or motives. And Jerry's story is backed up by a journal said to have been written by his Uncle Ted. A copy of this journal was sent directly to Stanton Fried- man by Jerry's cousin, now a Ca tholic nun, accompanied by the following note: With this mailing I want no more involvement in this sorry scenario, nor does my mother. Both Maria and I have been trans- ferred to another convent and our Mother has been moved. This family has been plagued by this incident for years and it is far beyond time that such should st op. Why Gerald would wish to reopen this is comple tely beyond me, I suppose he has his rea- sons. My father was obsessed with this unearthly horror and kept several journals to prevent others from getting to them. Wreckage and debris from the cras h, along with a larger journal are buried out there. ... I pray each and every day that God will grant protection not only to Gerald, but all of you who are in volved in th is. If these can help you in your quest, then so be it, but you must at this point honor [my] desire to no longer be involved. Forensic examination of the journal revealed that it was written no earlier than about 1970, but Gerald Anderson had already explained that Glenn had made several copies. So far, attempts to locate the bits of wreckage and the larger journal have proved unsuccessful.

Had they not seen eno ugh to convince themselves that something extremely unusua l had happened, it is doubt- ful that anyone would ever have heard this story. Luck, in the form of those who were on th e spot for othe r reasons, thus played a vital role in one of history's great stories. A large quantity of debris from a \"flying saucer\" lay in a field outside Corona, New Mexico, for several days before anyone connected with the U.S. govern ment had a clue that it was there. Apparently it was depos ited on the sheep ranch on the night of Wednesday, July 2, a nd was found the next morning by Foster Ranch foreman William \"M ac\" Brazel when he rode out to check on possible damage to fences or wind mills from the previous evening's seve re electrical storm. The government's first indica tion of a strange occurrence came a little after noon on Sunday, July 6, when Brazel paid a visit to Chaves Coun ty Sheriff George Wi lcox to show him a few samples of the odd material he had found.

Marcel drove 98 A"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"T HE M ILITARY T AKES O VER 99 the short distance to the sheriff's office, inspected the scraps, and was thoroughly puzzled by th eir unique appearance. He reported this to his commandi ng officer, Col. William \"Butch\" Blanchard, telling him of the fiel d full of debris and of the odd characteristics of the pieces he had just seen. Blanchard reacted quickly, or dering Major Marcel to get someone from the Counter-intel ligence Corps office and pro- ceed to the ranch with Brazel. They were ordered to collect as much of the material as they c ould load into their two vehicles and bring it back to the airbase. Soon after this, military police converged on the sheriff's office, took possession of the scra ps Brazel had left there, and delivered them to Blanchard's office. Testimony from several enlisted men points to the material then being flown to Eighth Air Force headquarters in Fort Worth, Tex., and from there to Washington, per specific instructions. Someone had obviously informed Washington that something important was going on in New Mexico. Meanwhile, Marcel and CIC captain Cavitt arrived at the Foster ranch late Sunday night , having struggled over terrible roads and some stretches wher e they had to drive cross- country. They spent the night in sleeping bags in a small build- ing and in the morning were taken by Mac Brazel to the place he had found the material. In 1979, Jesse Marcel described his experience: When we arrived at the crash site , it was amazing to see the vast amount of area it covered. It was nothing that h it the ground or exploded [on] the ground. It's something that must have exploded above ground, traveling perhaps at a high rate of speed ... we don't know. But it scattered over an area of about three quarters of a mile long, I would say, and fa irly wide, several hundred feet wide. So we proceeded to pick up all the fragments we could find and load up our Jeep Carry-All. It was quite obvious to me, [from my] familiarity] with air activities, that it was not a weather balloon, nor was it an airplane or a missile. What was it, we didn't know. We just picked up th e fragments. It was something I had never seen before , and I was pretty fa miliar with all air"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"100 C RASH AT C ORONA activities. We loaded up the Carry-All but I wasn't satisfied. I told Cavitt, \"You drive this vehicle back to the base and I'll go back out there and pick up as much as I can put in the car,\" which I did. But we picked up only a ve ry small portion of the material that was there. One thing that impressed me ab out the debris that we were referring to is the fact that a lo t of it looked like parchment. A lot of it had a lot of little mernbers [I beams] with symbols that we had to call them hieroglyphics because I could not interpret them, they could not be read; they were just symbols, something that meant something and they we re not all the same. The mem- bers that this was painted on—by th e way, those symbols were pink and purple ... uh ... lavender was actually what it was. And ... uh ... so these little members could not be broken, could not be burned ... I even tried to burn that. It would not burn. The same with the parchment we had. But something that is more astounding is that the piece of metal that we brought back was so thin, just like the tinfoil in a pack of cigarette paper. I didn't pay too much attention to that at first, until one of the GIs came to me and sa id, \"You know the metal that was in there? I trie d to bend that stuff and it won't bend. I even tried it with a sledge hammer. You can't make a dent on it.\" I didn't go back to look at it, myself, again, because we were busy in the office and I had quite a bit of wo rk to do. I am quite sure that this young fellow would not have lied to me about that, because he was a very truthful, very honest guy, so I accepted his word for that. So, beyond that, I didn't actually see him hit the matter with a sledge hammer, but he said, \"It's definite that it cannot be bent and it's so light that it doesn't weigh anything.\" And that was true of all the mate rial that was br ought up. It was so light that it weighed practically nothing. This particular piece of metal wa s, I would say, about two feet long and perhaps a foot wide. See, that stuff weighs nothing, it's so thin, it isn't any thicker than the tinfoil in a pack of ciga- rettes. So, I tried to bend the st uff [but] it wouldn't bend. We even tried making a dent in it with a sixteen-pound sledge hammer. And there was still no dent in it. I didn't have the time to go out there and find out more about it, because I had so much other work to do that I just let it go. It's still a mystery to"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"T HE M ILITARY T AKES O VER 101 me as to what the whole thing was. Like I said before, I knew quite a bit about the material used in the air, but it was nothing I had seen before. And as of now, I still don't know what it was. So that's how it stands. Once high-ranking (and t hus influential) pe ople in the mili- tary realized they were deali ng with very unusual materials beyond their experience, they qui ckly organized a mission to recover all of it, in order to lear n as much about it as they could and to make certain it did not fall into the wrong (meaning public) hands. Whatever it was, it ha d to be kept secret at least until the top brass in Fort Wo rth or Washington could decide what to do with it. A large group of soldiers was sent to the \"debris field\" on the sheep ranch near Coro na, including a lot of MPs whose job it was to limit acce ss to those the army wa nted on the scene. It was apparent that th e scraps in the fiel d were not all of whatever-it-had-been, and so a wide search wa s launched to find the rest. This was undoubte dly done on the ground (using Jeeps and trucks) and from the air, probably usin g small liaison planes suitable for rough-field landin gs if necessary. It couldn't have been more than a day or two before the expanded search paid off. A few miles from the debris field the main body of the craft was located , and a mile or two from that several bodies of small humanoi ds were found. The startling news (possibly including the word that one of the humanoids was still alive) was shot back to headquarters, and the entire nature of the operation change d. Any lingering thoughts that the debris could have come from some advanced Soviet missile or aircraft vanished with the realization that the crew, and therefore the craft, we re not from the Earth! An important operation instantly became an absolutely vi- tal mission. Never before in history had anything like this happened: Man had just come face to face with beings from another world. Decade s of Buck Rogers a nd Flash Gordon and B movies paled by comparison with this startling reality. We were being visited by an advanced civilization whose motives"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"102 C RASH AT C ORONA were totally unknown. Were they friendly scientific explorers, or were they an advance party paving the way for an invasion? If their motives were warlike, di d we stand any chance against those who could build craft ca pable of carrying them untold millions of miles? What would happen, say, if their friends came looking for them? While Major (later Lieutenant Colonel) Marcel talked about his experiences in the late 1970s , Sheridan Cavitt has refused even to acknowledge that he wa s there at the ranch with Mar- cel. However, another Counterintelligence Corps man from Roswell, Bill Rickett, has rece ntly spoken out on his experi- ences a few days after the st art of official involvement: \"[The material] was very str ong and very light. You could bend it but couldn't crease it. As far as I know, no one ever figured out what it was made of.\" Rickett escorted Dr. Lincoln LaPaz, famed meteor expert from the New Mexico In stitute of Meteoritic s, on a tour of the crash site and surrounding area. It was LaPaz's job to try to find out what the speed and trajectory of the thing was. LaPaz was a wo rld-renowned expert on trajec- tories of objects in the sky, especially meteors, and I was told to give him all the help I could. At one point LaPaz in terviewed the farmer [Mac Brazel]. I remember something coming up du ring their conversation about this fellow thinking th at some of his animal s had acted strangely after this thing happened. Dr. LaPaz seemed very interested in this for some reason. LaPaz wanted to fly over the ar ea, and this was arranged. He found one other spot where he fe lt this thing had touched down and then taken off again. The sand at this spot had been turned into a glasslike substance. We co llected a boxful of samples of this material—as I recall, there were some metal samples here, too, of that same sort of thin foil stuff. La Paz sent this box off somewhere for study; I don't know or recall where, but I never saw it again. This place was so me miles from the other one. LaPaz was very good at talking to people, especially some of the local ranch hands who didn't speak a lot of English. LaPaz spoke Spanish. I remember he fo und a couple of people who had"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"T HE M ILITARY T AKES O VER 103 seen two—I don't know what to call them ,- UFOs, I suppose— anyway, had seen two of these things fly over very slowly at a very low altitude on a date, in the evening that he determined had been a day or two after th e other one had blown up. These people said something about an imals being affected, too. . .. Before he went back to Albuquerq ue, he told me that he was certain that this th ing had gotten into tr ouble, that it had touched down for repairs, taken off again, and then exploded. He also felt certain there were more than one of th ese devices, and that the others had been looking for it—at least that's what he said. He was positive th e thing had malfunctioned. The Air Force's explanation that it was a balloon was totally untrue. It was not a balloon. I neve r did know for sure what its purpose was, but it wasn't ours. I remember speculating with LaPaz that it might have been some higher civilization checking on us. LaPaz wasn't against the idea, but said he was going to leave speculations out of his report. Dr. LaPaz, who had been deeply involved in a 1950s study of \"green fireballs\" that had some UFO characteristics, unfor- tunately died before anyone b ecame aware of his involvement in the New Mexico crash episode. His report is one of the many documents the government has been able to conceal from the public for more than forty years. In general, the government has done a wonderful job of keep- ing all details of the crashes secret. Few names of military people and others who visited the sites are known, and those who are known have, in most cas es, been unwilling to talk. With one fascinating exception. In November 1990 Stanton Friedman was able to cap months of negotiations by interview- ing, in person, a man who says in a most believable fashion that he was there and he saw. F. B. was an Army Air Forces photographer stationed at An- acostia Naval Air Station, Washin gton, D.C., when he and fel- low photographer A. K. were hu stled aboard an army B-25 bomber and flown to Roswell Army Air Field sometime during the second week of July 1947.

We got out there [one of the three crash sites in the Corona area] and there was a helluva lot of people out there, in a closed tent. You couldn't hardly see anything inside the tent. They said, \"Set your camera up to take a picture fifteen feet away.\" A. K. got in a truck and headed out to wh ere they was pickin' up pieces. All kinds of brass runnin' around.

I guess there was ten to twelve officers, and when I got ready to go in, they'd all come out. The tent was about twenty by thirty foot. The bodies looked like they was lyin' on a tarp. One guy did all the instructions. He'd take a flashlight and he'd come down there: \"See this flashlight?\" Yes, sir! \"You're in focus with it?\" Yes, sir! \"Take a picture of this.\" He'd take the flashlight away. We just moved around in a circle, taki n' pictures. Seemed to me [the bodies] were all just about iden tical. Dark-complected.

In the case of the crash by th e Plains of San Agustin, 150 miles to the west, the arrival of the military was observed by about a dozen civilians: Gera ld Anderson and his family, a group of student archaeologists or geologists, and government engineer Barney Barnett. Of thes e, Barnett told several friends a little about his experience, and Anderson has gone into great detail about wh at happened when the army showed up while he and the others were trying to make some sense out of a shocking experience. According to Barnett's good friend Vern Maltais, he said, \"While we were looking at [the bodies], a milita ry officer drove up on a truck with a driver and to ok control. He told everybody that the Army was taking over and to get out of the way. Other military personnel cam e up and cordoned off the area. We were told to leave the area-and not to talk to anyone about what we had seen ... that it was our patriotic duty to remain silent.\" Gerald Anderson, in a Septembe r 1990, interview, went into considerably more detail: The first thing that showed up, if I remember correctly, was a car that looked like ours. And it came up from behind, and it had driven right out to this thing, acr oss the prairie there, the desert part.

There was some other ma- chinery and stuff that had come down off the side and was pulling up there, stopping. It was one of those trucks that had pulled right up there to the crash site. Soldiers were moving around. There were a lot of things hap- pening back there. They were st retching out cables of some kind. Looked like they were stretching stuff out on the ground, drag- ging stuff out of these trucks. There was a lot of 'em just standing around. But there was a frenzy of activity back there. Just as soon as they got us out of there, ev erything just started getting fren- zied back there. When we got up [to the main road ], they already had the fence down and they were bringing stuff through, and I remember there was a Jeep that was pulling a trailer with a motor on it, like a generator. When we got on the ro ad, it was Ted that said, \"Can we go back over to the store an d get somethin' to drink?\" \"No!"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"108 C RASH AT C ORONA You go that way (the soldier pointed east) and you go that way now!\" It was very hostile, and ve ry direct, and to the point. Once the Andersons had been chased away from the crash site and were on their way home , the military co uld proceed as it wished with no one to obser ve. Material was removed to parts unknown, though White Sands/Alamagordo has been suggested, as have Los Alamos and Sandia Base. These areas had the scientific fac ilities to make possibl e some analysis of the wreckage and even bodies, a nd both were highly secure. But the clues are not what one would hope ... yet. Somewhere, there is a very la rge quantity of material, and probably some quite large pieces of two or more UFOs that came to rest within the borders of the Un ited States and maybe in one or more friendly nations . Exactly where they are is a mystery. Even the pieces that went to Wright Field from Roswell AAF and Fort Worth AAF may not be there today. They could well have been moved many times for reasons of security and scientific research. _ Rumors abound that the U.S.A. has been i nvolved in at- tempting to fly a captured UFO from one of its very secret bases in Nevada. Some individuals have even claimed that we have worked closely with actual aliens to adapt their technol- ogy to our uses. And that so me of our early \"stealth\" airplanes—the Lockheed F-117 st ealth fighter and the North- rop B-2 stealth bomber, in part icular—have benefited from \"outside\" assistance. Absolutely nothing has been offered to support these extreme cl aims, and so they mu st be considered no more than rumors. The authors feel they may even be disin- formation planted by unnamed government representatives to further confuse the UFO scene. On a much more reas onable level, it has been suggested that the first UFO material to be re trieved was so technically ad- vanced that it could not be unde rstood even by our top scien- tists.

As this was all done by the military in remote areas where the few residents were cons ciously patriotic, it was a lot easier to keep secret the details than elements of the crashes that had been observed by civilia ns. Just who was involved, and where the remains were taken, is still a subject for investiga- tion. What is known is that Mac Brazel started it all by bringing a few samples of debris from the Foster ranch to the office of Sheriff George Wilcox in Roswell on July 6. After Major Marcel and CICman Cavitt left Roswel l for the ranch, the samples apparently were left behind at the sheriff' s office, as there was no point in taking them back to the ranch. According to the daughters of Sheri ff Wilcox, interviewe d in 1990, the army arrived, created quit e a stir, and took the strange pieces away. They almost certainly went stra ight to the office of Roswell Army Air Field commander Col. William Blanchard. Just what Blanchard did with the samples can only be sur- mised, but it seems increasingly likely that he had them flown to Eighth Air Force he adquarters in Fort Worth, Texas, where 110 D"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"R ETRIEVAL AND S HIPMENT 111 Eighth Air Force commander Gen. Roger Ramey took control of them. According to retired Br ig. Gen. Thomas Jefferson Du- Bose, interviewed in 1990 by Stanton Friedman, material from the Corona crash site was at Fort Worth two or three days before the July 8 pr ess conference at which General Ramey promoted the phony \"weat her balloon\" story. Those samples could have arrived at Fort Worth while Mar- cel and Cavitt were still on thei r way to the Foster ranch, and while hardly anyone el se in the world was aware that anything unusual had happened near Co rona. This was probably the small amount of material that then-colonel DuBose saw wrapped in plastic and attached to the wrist of Co l. Al Clarke, base commander at Fort Worth. With his precious cargo treated like secret diplomatic corres pondence, Clarke was flown to Washington, D.C., on the dire ct orders of Gen. Clemence McMullen, acting commander of the Strategic Air Command at Andrews AAF. It was McMu llen who gave the telephone order to DuBose to rush the sc raps there by \"colonel courier\" and to concoct a cove r story to mislead th e press. What hap- pened to the material when it got to Washington is unknown, but it well could have played a major role in convincing those two thousand miles from the Ne w Mexico desert that some- thing of cosmic signi ficance had happened. When Marcel and Cavitt return ed to Roswell Army Air Field early on the morning of July 8, they brought with them two carloads of debris. It was this, or at least most of it, that Marcel accompanied on a flight to Fort Worth AAF; he described it as \"half a B-29 full.\" While a B- 29 is a large airplane, it was designed to carry a load of h eavy items—bombs—rather than a lot of lighter objects that mi ght be carried by a cargoplane. Thus it would have been feasible to half-fill a B-29's storage area—its bomb bays—with no mo re debris than could have been stuffed into a stati on wagon and a Jeep Carry-All. It isn't known how many airpla nes left Roswell AAF car- rying materials from the Corona crash site, or where all of them went. Wright Field (lat er Wright-Patterson Air Force Base) in Dayton, Ohio, is most often mentioned as the destina-"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"112 C RASH AT C ORONA tion of one or more of these flight s. Wright is a logical destina- tion, as it housed much of th e Army Air Forces' scientific laboratories and was staffed by some of th e top technical peo- ple in the USAAF. But the detail s simply have not been un- earthed. There is reason to believe, howeve r, that at least one airplane was sent down from Wright Field to either Roswell AAF or Fort Worth AAF to collect materials fo r return to Wright Field. The son of a man who was reportedly on such a flight told Stanton Friedman that it is his understa nding that the crew actually played with some of the de bris during the flight home. It is known that not long af ter Marcel and Cavitt returned from the Foster ranch with their supply of fascinating debris, a much larger military force was sent to th e ranch to collect every scrap. Resi dents have testified th at Military Police set up roadblocks around the ranch and kept them away from the scene. They also kept the press out, as st ated by Jud Roberts, then manager of ra dio station KGFL, in a 1990 interview: \"I wanted to go out to the crash site. [Station owner W C] Whitmore had been out there, bu t he couldn't get any closer than I did. I thought we could do it with back roads (of which the area is well supplied) but we didn't get close.\" They en- countered Military Police who told them, \"Sorry, but the road's closed. This is a restri cted area.\" \"It wasn't such a big deal, as we'd had these experiences befo re, when [airplane] accidents had happened. They just kind of blocked off the whole area. It was perfectly reasonable, as far as I was concerned. I'll bet I wasn't within fifteen miles [of the Foster ranch crash site].\" Even the limited evidence from the Corona area strongly suggests there were three separa te crash sites: the so-called debris field on the Foster ra nch, where so much scrap was found by Brazel and th en collected by Mar cel and Cavitt; a site several miles away, where the main body of the craft lay; and a site within a mile or two of that, where th e bodies were found in or near what Glenn Dennis has described as \"escape cap- sules.\" Apparently the Roswell AAF mortuary officer had been"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"R ETRIEVAL AND S HIPMENT 113 there, as had photographer F. B v who described the scene where he was taken to shoot pictures of bodies under the total control of an officer. F. B. described another photogr apher being driven away to a different location where wreckag e was being collected. This may have been the original \"debri s field,\" or it could have been the spot where what was left of the saucer ended up. Clearly, more information is needed fr om men who were there and who so far have refused to describe their experiences. Next to nothing is known about the recovery of material and bodies from the San A gustin site, as the army did such an efficient job of sealing off the area. While it is not far from a paved road, it is in Catron County, the least heavily populated county in New Mexico, which in those days was one of the least populated of states. The closest thing to a description of post-crash activity comes from a diary kept by Jerry Ander- son's uncle, Ted. While the copy of the diary acquired by Stan- ton Friedman through a complex series of negotiations is not an original (the ink did not exist in 1947), it may be one of several copies made by Ted or Vict or in an effort to assure the information's survival. In it, he states: John T. and I talked on the phone and he said the Army is still out on the Plata [one of several local terms for the area] and they are combing the sand and putting stuff in bags and boxes and hauling it all away on big flat trailers. He said they have lights out there and all kinds of things. All the roads are blocked down there by the Army. John said they have machine guns and tanks and all that kind of stuff. John.. . said the Milita ry is asking all kinds of questions up at Horse Springs store and Magdalena . Making a lot of noise about what could happen to traitors and that you could get shot for talking about military secrets.

All of these places were far better equipped to handle highly sensitive scientific materi als than was Ro swell. Wit- nesses claimed that some of the military people who arrived first at San Agusti n were from Alamogordo. The number of people involved in the r ecovery of wreckage and bodies, and the subsequent obliteration of clues to the crashes, was growing ra pidly. Scores if not hundreds of men had been sent out from as many as four locations to the two crash sites to collect material, tran sport it, and guard against un- authorized intrusion and releas e of information. Once the ma- terial and bodies got back to the military facilities that had been hurriedly prepared to deal with this unprecedented chal- lenge, more people jo ined the inner circle, and the job of secu- rity became even more complex. The presence in New Mexico of very strange substances from the wreckage of the two crashe s has been testified to by so many people that it is virtuall y proved. That th e wreckage was \"accompanied by the bodies of as many as eight small human- oid aliens is anothe r matter. A few people have described, in limited but highly consistent deta il, their awareness or even direct observation of miniature, out-of-proportion bodies at the crash sites and elsewhere. The evidence for them is increas- ingly impressive, but perhaps not yet co mpletely convincing. However, like the acquisition of totally unfamiliar manufac- tured materials of striking physi cal characterist ics, the con- firmed existence of obviously nonhuman bodies will, by itself, establish not only the reality of UFOs but also their extrater- restrial origin. It is for this r eason that so much effort has gone into trying to pin down the spec ifics of the reported observa- tions, by Stanton Friedman and others. One of the most in- triguing examples of secondha nd testimony abou t alien bodies comes from a man who did not personally see them, but be- cause of his unusual position wa s able to get close enough to realize that what wa s happening was very di fferent from any- thing that had happened before. Glenn Dennis was a young pr ofessional mortician in Roswell in the summer of 1947 whose employer, the Ballard"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"R ETRIEVAL AND S HIPMENT 115 Funeral Home, had the contract with the Roswell Army Air Field to provide mortuary serv ices. He drove a combination hearse and ambulance fo r both the civilian pa rt of the business and the airbase assignments. On numerous occasions he had been called upon to he lp collect mangled bod ies from military plane crashes and then prepare the remains for shipment back to the survivors. Dennis was fu lly familiar with the air base and \"could go wherever I wanted to.\" It was this unusual ease of access to an otherwise secure military installation that en- abled him to see and hear a lot more than he was supposed to. In August 1989 Denn is was interviewed by Stanton Fried- man in Lincoln, New Mexico, where he managed a historic tourist hotel. Even though the interview had to be squeezed into the turmoil of th e annual celebration of Billy the Kid Day, Dennis was fully able to communicate the sense of excitement that surrounded his blundering into a particul arly sensitive part of the Corona cr ash. Later he added information in other interviews. The date was July 9 or 10, 1947. Glenn Dennis was as yet unaware of the discovery of the strange wreckage at the Foster ranch, and had heard nothing ab out alien bodies. He had gotten several puzzling phone calls from the Roswell AAF mortuary officer, who was more of an ad ministrator than a technical specialist familiar with the intr icacies of handling corpses, human or otherwise. The officer wanted to know about \"her- metically sealed caskets: What was the smallest one they could get,\" Dennis recalled. Th en he wanted to know \"what the chemical solutions were that we were using for the vats and all that. He asked me about the chemical composition of blood, about the breakdown of tissue, what happened to tissue when it has laid out [in the sun] for several days.\" This is what was so interesting. See, this is why I feel like there was really something involved in this, because they didn't want to do anything that was going to ... make an imbalance. They kept saying, \"OK, what's this go ing to do to th e blood system, what's this going to do to the tissue?\" Then when they informed"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"116 C RASH AT C ORONA me that these bodies [had] laid ou t in the middle of July, in the middle of the prairie, I mean that body's going to be as dark as your [blue] blazer, there, and it's going to be in bad shape. I was the one who suggested [using] dry ice ... I'd done that a time or two. I talked to them four or five times in the afternoon. They would keep calling back and asking me diffe rent questions in- volving the body. What they were really after was how to move those bodies. They didn't give me any indication they even had the bodies, or where they were. But they kept talking about these bodies, and I said, \"What do the bodies look like?\" And they said, \"I don't know, but I'll tell you one thing: This happened some time ago.\" The only thing that was mentioned was that they were exposed to the elemen ts for several days. I understand these bodies weren't in the same location as where they found some of the others. They said the bodies weren't in the vehicle itself; th e bodies were separated by two or three miles from it. They talked about three different bodies: two of them mangled, one that was in pretty good shape. Later that day—around 6:00 or 7:00 P . M .—Dennis took a slightly injured GI accident vi ctim to the base infirmary, which was in the same building as the hospital and the mortu- ary. He walked the airman inside and then drove around to the back of the building to see a pretty young Army Air Forces nurse he had recently gotten to kno w. He parked by the ramp as usual, next to several old-styl e, square military ambulances of World War II vintage. That was when things began to get sticky. There were two MPs standing ri ght there, and I got out and started to go in. I wouldn't have go tten as far as I did, if I hadn't parked in the Emergency area . They probably thought I was coming after somebody. The door s were open to the military ambulances and that's where some wreckage was, and there was an MP on each side. I saw all this wreckage. I don't know what it was, but I knew there was something going on, and that's when I first got an inclination that some- thing was happening. What was so curious about it , was that in two of those ambulances was a d eal that looked like [the bottom]"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"R ETRIEVAL AND S HIPMENT 117 half of a canoe.

[G lenn later said that he saw a row of unrecognizable sym bols—several inches high—on the metal devices.] I just glanced in and kept going. When I got inside, I noticed ther e was quite a bit of activity. When I went back into the lounge, there were \"big birds\" [high- ranking officers he didn't recognize, though he was familiar with all the local medical people] ever ywhere. They were really shook up. So I went down the hall wher e I usually go, and I got down the hall just a little way and an MP me t me right there. He wanted to know who the hell I wa s and where I was fr om, and what busi- ness did I have there? I explai ned who I was. Evidently he was under the impression that th ey called me to come out. Anyway, I got past that and I went on in and then this is where I met the nurse—she was involved in this thing, she was on duty. She told me, \"How in the hell did you get in here?\" I said, \"I just walked in.\" She sai d, \"My God, you ar e going to get killed!\" And I said, \"They didn't stop me!\" I was going to the Coke machine to get us a Coke, and this big red-he aded colonel said, \"What's that son of a bitch doin' here?\" He hollered at the MPs and that 's when it hit the fan! These two MPs grabbed me by the arms and carried me clear outside. .. they carried me to the ambulance . . . I didn't walk, they carried me! And they told me to get my ass out of there! [Not only that, but according to Dennis, they fo llowed him all the way back to the funeral home.] About two or three hours later, th ey [called] and told me, \"You open your mouth [about th is] and you'll be so far back in the jug they'll have to shoot pinto beans [into you] with a bean shooter!\" I just laughed and said, \"Go to hell!\" That was the last Glenn Denn is heard from anyone in an official position. He didn't see the nurse until the next day, and by then she was really upset. \"She called me and said, 'If you've got time, come out. I need to talk to you.' \" They agreed to meet at the officers' club for lunch, a nd when Dennis saw her, he was afraid she was about to go into shock, she looked so different. \"My God, I don't know how you go t in there,\" the nurse told"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"118 C RASH AT C ORONA him. \"It's amazing what's goi ng on. You wouldn't believe it! That's when she told me they did have some bodies.

Really, what they looked like was ancient Chinese: small, fragile, no hair.\" She said their noses didn't pro- trude, the eyes were set pretty de ep and the ears were just little indentations. She said the anatomy of the arms was different (the upper arm was longer th an the lower). They didn't have thumbs, they had four different . .. she called them \"tentacles,\" I think. Didn't have any fingernails. Sh e then described how they had little things like suction cups on their fingertips. I asked her were these men or wo men? [Were their] sex organs the same as ours? She said, \"No, some were missing.\" [Dennis interjected, \"The first thing that decomposes on a body would be the brain, next the sex organs , especially in women. But she thought there had probably been something .. . some animals. Some of these bodies were badly mutilated. She said they got the bodies out of those co ntainers [the ones he had seen in the backs of the ambulances, on the way into the hospital]. See, they weren't at the crash site, they were about a mile or two from the crash site. She said they looked like they had their own little cabins. She said the lower portion—the abdomen and legs—was crushed, but the upper portion wasn't that bad. She told me the head... was larger and it was kind of. . . like . . . the eyes were different. The nurse then pulled out a pr escription pad and drew some sketches of what she had descri bed to Glenn Dennis. She gave him the drawings, warning him to keep them secret, and so he guarded them carefully. In 199 0, he and Stanton Friedman went through his old files at th e funeral home and discovered all his material had been thrown out several years before. Glenn then made some sketches of what he could remember. \"Until they got those bodies fr ozen, the smell was so bad you couldn't get within a hundred feet of them without gagging.\" It"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"R ETRIEVAL AND S HIPMENT 119 was when the nurse stepped out of the room where she had been assisting two doctors on the bodies, to get some air, that she had run into Dennis. She explained that even the doctors were getting sick, and that the smell was so bad they had to turn off the air cond itioning to keep it fr om spreading through- out the hospital. Soon, they gave up tryi ng to work under such conditions and completed the pr eparation of the bodies in a hangar. After describing the strange events to Dennis, the nurse appeared to be on th e verge of collapse from the emotional trauma, so he drove her back to her barracks. He never saw her again. Attempts to get in touc h with her were met with ob- struction. He was told she was away at a se minar, then that she had been transferred to England without even getting in touch with him. His first letter was an swered with a cryptic promise from her to explain everything at a later date. His second letter was returned, stamped Deceased. Efforts to trace the nurse have been unsuccessful. There is no file on her in the permanent military record s office where all persons who have died while in service are supposed to be recorded. There is no evidence that anyone by her name served as an army nurse. Fo llowing a suggestion th at she might have been killed in a mili tary plane crash in England or Europe, a search was made of the newspaper Stars and Stripes as well as official records. If such a crash ever occurred, it has been wiped from the records. A few weeks after the incident at the hospital, Glenn Dennis heard from his father: \"What the hell'd you get into? What kind of trouble are you in?\" I said, \"I 'm not in any trouble.\" And he said, \"The hell you're not! The sher iff [an old friend of the elder Dennis] said that base personnel have been in and they want to know all about your background!\" But there has never been any indication that the military did anything mo re about the uninvited mortician who got so close to the bodies. Dennis was a civilian who worked for a firm having a government contract, and was subject to military re gulations only when he was on the airbase or on a military as signment such as an airplane"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"120 C RASH AT C ORONA crash recovery. Besides, he never saw a sing le alien body, though he must have been within a few feet of several of them. One of the few people Glenn recognized in the hospital building during the brief, hectic period before he was forceably removed was a pediatrician who was then in the army. They talked several years later, when the man had returned to pri- vate practice. According to Dennis, \"He didn't have a lot to say. We were pretty good friends. 'H ell,' he said, 'I don't know what it was. Whatever happened was co mpletely out of my field of medicine.' \" \" 'That's what he to ld me,' \" Dennis added. \"But he was involved, and he and I discussed it.\" Roswell was just a c onvenience. It was th e military base down the street from the sheriff's office to which Mac Brazel brought his samples of material, and so it became a center of activity. But it was a flying field, not a scientific installation. If the materials and bodies recovered fro m the wilds were to be dealt with properly, they would have to be removed from Roswell AAF as quickly and as quietly, as possible. Officers streamed into Rosw ell AAF from military bases around the country, s hoved the local people out of the way and proceeded to turn the already se cure airfield into an armed camp. People and buildings were commandeered as if nothing else in the world matte red, which just may have been the case. With an urgency borne of myst ery and of pressure from the very top, Roswell AAF became the starting point for some unusual journeys. It was necessary to sh ip every scrap of wr eckage and at least three bodies and possibly one live alien to various installations where they could be handled a nd studied under conditions of greater security, and in more appropriate facilities. Roswell AAF would then have to be re turned to its normal, precrash status as rapidly as possible, to reduce the chances of informa- tion leaking out and posing a se rious threat to security. The first flight out of Roswell with wreckage fr om the Foster ranch was probably on July 6 a nd consisted of the few pieces"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"R ETRIEVAL AND S HIPMENT 121 Mac Brazel brought into town to show to Sheriff George Wilcox. It appears to have been flown to Fort Worth AAF and from there to Washington, but in formation on this is sketchy. The next flight must have b een on July 8, and carried the material brought back by Marcel and Cavitt. Retired M/Sgt. Robert Porter, a B-29 flight engineer with the 830th Bomb Squadron, related his pa rt in this flight when interviewed dur- ing a conference of crash witne sses near Washington, D.C., in July 1990. He had talked to Friedman more than ten years before and is Lorett a Proctor's brother. We flew these pieces—[some offi cers in the crew] told us it was parts of a flying saucer. The pack ages were in wrapping paper, one triangle-shaped about two and a half feet across the bottom, the rest in smaller, shoebox-sized packages. [They were in] brown paper with tape. It was just like I picked up an empty package .. . very light. The loaded triang le-shaped package and three shoebox-sized packages would have fit into the trunk of a car. On board were Lt. Col. Payne Jennings [deputy commander of Roswell] and Major Marcel. Captain Anderson said it was from a flying saucer. We got to Fort Wo rth, they transferred [the pack- ages] to a B-25 and took them to Wright [Field]. When we landed at [Fort Worth], Colonel Jennings to ld us to take care of mainte- nance, and after a guard was poste d, we could eat lunch. We came back, they told us they had tran sferred the material to a B-25. They told us it was a weather balloon. It wasn't a weather bal- loon! There remains the discrepancy between Porter's description of just a few small packages of material on the flight carrying Major Marcel and the latter's statement to Stanton Friedman in 1979 that the load was \"half a B-29 full.\" What is clear is that the material could hardly have been from something as ordi- nary, recognizable, and unmyste rious as a weather balloon. Pieces of balloons are not transported with such urgency and security. Another view of what was almost certainly the same flight comes from former 1st Lt. Robert Shirkey, then assistant opera-"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"122 C RASH AT C ORONA tions officer of the 5O9th Bomb Group, who was also inter- viewed in July 1990. In July 1947 he was on duty in the Opera- tions Office when thin gs began to happen. \"A call came in to have a B-29 re ady to go as so on as possible. Where to? Fort Worth, on Colonel Blanchard's directive. [I was] in the Operations Office when Colonel Blanchard arrived and asked if the airplane was ready. When told it was, Blanchard waved to somebody, and approxim ately five people came in the front door, down the hallway and onto the ramp to climb into the airplane, carrying parts of th e crashed flying saucer. I got a very short glimpse ... asked Blan chard to turn sideways so [I] could see, too. Saw them carryi ng pieces of metal: they had one piece that was eighteen by twenty -four inches, brushed stain- less steel in color.\" The plane went to Fort Wo rth and Marcel went with it, Shirkey added. There are certainly discrepancies, but after forty-three years, memories begin to fa de and to swirl toge ther. While specific details may vary, the general stor y is the same: A very special flight was loaded with a small amount of material and sent to Fort Worth under unusual and qu ite memorable conditions. It was generally accepted that th e material was from a crashed flying saucer, though th is was never put in writing or even announced formally. Me n who work close to gether, especially in airplane crews, learn to communicate easily and to read between the lines. They had been alerted to some very different events by the Army's own security procedures. One of the next flights to l eave Roswell AAF was apparently on or about July 9, according to fo rmer S/Sgt.

In midafternoon of that special day, he was aboard a B-29 that taxied to the bomb-loading area, located far from the main part of the base for safety reasons. There they loaded a single crate he estimated was twel ve feet long, fi ve feet wide, and four feet high. There were MPs on board, Slusher said, and they were armed, suggesting the crate cont ained something more excit- ing than canned hams or office supplies.

But the bomb bay, where the mysterious crat e was carried, cannot be pres- surized, as it is designed to be opened in flight at high altitude so bombs can be dropped. Whatev er was in the crate, which was too large to be carried in an y other part of the airplane, had to be protected from a major drop in air pressure. Adding to the surreal atmosphere wa s the presence of th e four MPs in the bomb bay. When they arrived at Fort Wort h AAF, 1st Lt. Felix Martucci of the 393rd Bomb Squadron told Slusher, \"We made history.\" He did not elaborate, leaving the puzzled serg eant to make of it what he could. The crate was then loaded onto a flatbed weapons carrier and hauled off, accompanied by the MPs, whose need to guard a sealed wooden box was not explained. On the flight back to Roswe ll, \"Capt. Frederick Ewing was the pilot, the co-pilot was 1st Lt. Edgar Izard, Sgt. David Tyner was the engineer, th e navigator was Jame s Eubanks. Others involved were S/Sgt. Arthur Osepchook a nd Cpl. Thaddeus Love. The four MPs also came back with us. \"The return flight was above twenty thousand feet, and the cabin was pressurized. The r ound trip took approximately three hours, fifteen minutes. The flight was unusual in that we flew there, dropped th e cargo, and returned immediately. It was a hurried flight; normally we kne w the day before [that] there would be a flight. \"There was a rumor that the crat e had debris from the crash. Whether there were any bodies , I don't know. The crate had been specially made ; it had no markings.\" By flying at low altitude with the special crate, the army planted the idea that whatever wa s in it, was sensitive to air pressure. That suggests it was not merely scrap pieces of metal brought back by Marcel and Cavitt but rath er something bio- logical, such as a body or even a living being. But this is only a supposition, based solely on circumstantial evidence."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"124 C RASH AT C ORONA Once the material returned to Roswell AAF by Marcel and Cavitt had been sent elsewhere, the army set out to collect what remained at th e sheep ranch. A majo r recovery operation was put into motion, and a large quantity of foil, I beams, heavy paper, black plastic, and other materials were trucked the seventy-five difficult miles to Roswell. Robert E. Smith was then a member of th e 1st Air Transport Unit, which operated Douglas C-54 Skymaster four-eng ined cargo plan es out of the Roswell AAF. In a 1991 interview, he de scribed his involve- ment: A lot of people began coining in all of a sudden because of the official investigation. Somebody sa id it was a plane crash, but we heard from a man in Roswell that it was not a plane crash: it was something else, a strange object. There was another indication that something serious was goi ng on. One night, when we were coming back to Roswell, a convoy of trucks covered with canvas passed us. When they go t to the [airfield] gate, they headed over to this hangar on the east end, which was rather unusual. The truck convoy had red lights and sirens. My involvement in the ... incident was to help load crates of debris into the aircraft. We all became aware of the event when we went to the hangar on the east side of the ramp. There were a lot of people in plain clothes a ll over the place. They were \"in- spectors,\" but they were stranger s on the base. When challenged, they replied they were here on Project So-and-So, and flashed a card, which was different from a military ID card. We were taken to the hangar to load crates. There was a lot of farm dirt on the hangar floor. We loaded [the crates] on flatbeds and dollies; each crate had to be checked as to width and height. We had to know which crates we nt on which plane. We loaded crates on three [or] four C-54s. We weren't supposed to know their destination, but we were told they were headed north. All I saw was a little piece of material. You could crumple it up, let it come out; you couldn't crease it. One of our people put it in his pocket. The piece of debris I saw was two to three inches square. It was jagged. When you crumpled it up, it then laid back out. And when it did, it kind of crackled, making a sound like celophane . . . it crackled when it was let out. There were no creases."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"R ETRIEVAL AND S HIPMENT 125 There were armed guards around during loading of our planes, which was unusual at Roswell. Th ere was no way to get to the ramp except through armed guar ds. There were MPs on the outskirts, and our pers onnel were between them and the planes. The largest [crate] was roughly twenty feet long, four to five feet high, and four to five feet wi de. It took up an en tire plane; it wasn't that heavy, but it was a large volume. The rest of the crates were two or thre e feet long and two feet square or smaller. The sergeant who had the piece of material said [it was like] the material in the crates. The entire loading took at least six, per- haps eight hours. Lunch was br ought to us, wh ich was unusual. The crates were brought to us on flatbed dollies, which was also unusual. Officially, we were told it wa s a crashed plane, but crashed planes usually were taken to th e salvage yard, not flown out. I don't think it was an experiment al plane, because not too many people in that area were experi menting with planes. I'm con- vinced that what we loaded was a UFO that got into mechanical problems .. . even with the mo st intelligent pe ople, things go wrong.

Wil- liam Fortner. Capt. Oliver Wendell \"Pappy\" Henderson may have been the most highly regarded pilot at Ro swell AAF. A veteran of thirty missions in B-24 Libera tor bombers in Europe , he participated in the postwar A-bomb tests in the Pacific and earned major commendations for his flying. He nderson kept qu iet about the unsettling events of July 1947 fo r three decades. Finally, he mentioned them to a fellow retired officer, dentist John Kromschroeder, with whom he was then involved in a joint business venture. The dentist said nothing a bout this until July 1990, more than four year s after Henderson's death from cancer. In 1977, Pappy had to ld Kromschroe der about the incident. He said he transported wrecka ge and alien bodies, describing the latter as \"spacecraft garbag e,\" and adding \"t he passengers suffered their death.\" Henderso n, in the recollection of"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"126 C RASH AT C ORONA Kromschroeder, descri bed the bodies simply as being \"small.\" About a year later, around 1978, Henderson produced a piece of metal he had taken from the collec tion of wreckage. \"I gave it a good, thorough looking-at,\" Krom schroeder said in 1990, \"and decided it was an alloy we are not familiar with (he and Hen- derson shared an interest in me tallurgy). Gray, lustrous metal resembling aluminum, lighter in weight and much stiffer. [We couldn't] bend it. . . e dges sharp and jagged.\" The priceless scrap of material may be tucked away in Pap- py's records and papers , just waiting to be freed. But there is currently no way to search the two thousand-plus cubic feet of materials that jam two small stor age buildings and a garage to the ceilings. His widow, Sappho, ha s rejected suggestions that investigators be allowed to search through a lifetime of her late husband's memorabilia. The pros pect is daunting, for a slim piece of metal could be hidden between any two pieces of paper in any of many scores of bulging cardboar d boxes. Even if she were willing to have strangers paw through such personal mat- ters, it could take hundreds of hour s, and there is no assurance that the scrap of cras hed UFO is there. It could have been lost, thrown out, or ev en confiscated. In 1982, Henderson met with se veral members of his old bomber crew during an Air Di vision reunion in Nashville. According to one of the men in the group, \"It was in his hotel room that he told us the story of the UF O and about his part. All we were told by Pappy is th at he flew the plane to Wright Field. He definitely mentioned th e bodies, but I don't recall any details except that they were small and different . I was skepti- cal at first, but soon saw th at Pappy was quite serious.\" Pappy died before Stanton Frie dman got a chance to inter- view him. But his widow, Sappho, agreed to be interviewed, as did his daughter, Mary. Sappho de scribed what her husband had told her: We met during World War II when he flew with the 446th Bomb Squadron,- he flew B-24s [on] thir ty missions over Germany. After the war, he returned home . . . and was then sent to Roswell."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"R ETRIEVAL AND S HIPMENT 127 While stationed there, he ran th e \"Green Hornet Airline,\" which involved flying C-54s and C-47s carrying VIPs, scientists, and materials from Roswell to the Pacific during the atom bomb tests. He had to have a Top S ecret clearance fo r this respon- sibility. In 1980 or 1981, he picked up a newspaper at a grocery store where we were living in San Di ego. One article described the crash of a UFO outside Roswell, w ith the bodies of aliens discov- ered beside the craft. He pointed out the article to me and said, \"I want you to read this article, because it's a true story. I'm the pilot who flew the wreckage of the UFO to Dayton, Ohio [home of Wright Field]. I guess now that they're putting it in the paper, I can tell you about this. I wanted to tell you for years.\" Pappy never discussed his work because of his security clearance. He described the beings as sm all with large heads for their size. He said the material that their suits were made of was different than anything he had ev er seen. He said they looked strange. I believe he mentioned that the bodies had been packed in dry ice to preserve them. Mrs. Mary Kathryn Groode, Pappy's daughter, added her remembrances to those of her mother. When I was growing up, he and I would often spend evenings looking at the stars. On one o ccasion, I asked him what he was looking for. He said, \"I'm looking for flying saucers. They're real, you know.\" In 1981, during a visit to my parents' home, my father showed me a newspaper article which de scribed the crash of a UFO and the recovery of alie n bodies outside Roswell, New Mexico. He told me that he saw the crashed craft and the alien bodies de- scribed in the article, and that he had flown the wreckage to Ohio. He described the alien beings as small and pale, with slanted eyes and large heads. He said they were humanoid- looking, but different from us. I think he said there were three bodies. He said the matter had been To p Secret and that he was not supposed to discuss it with anyone, but that he felt it was alright to tell me because it was in the newspaper."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"128 C RASH AT C ORONA Friedman also spoke with Pa ppy's son and cousin, both of whom told of having heard Pappy quietly tell his story after the newspaper article appeared. On the basis of all that is known of Pappy's brief mentions of his involvement with the events at Roswell, it appears that while he probably saw bodies at the airbase, he may have transported only materi als to Wright Field. Another man who saw bodies was Sgt. Melv in Brown, a cook at Roswell AAF who was called ou t to help guard the material retrieved from the Fo ster ranch. In 1989, his daughter Beverly gave the following story to St anton Friedman from her home in England, about her la te father, \"Brownie\": When we were young, he used to tell us stories about things that had happened to him when he was young. We got to know those stories by heart and would all say together, \"Here we go again!\" Sometimes, but not too often, he used to say that he saw a man from outer space. That used to make us all gigg le like mad. He said he had to stand guard duty outside a hangar where a crashed flying saucer was stor ed, and that his comm anding officer said, \"Come on, Brownie, let's have a l ook inside.\" But they didn't see anything because it had all been packed up and [was] ready to be flown out to Texas. He also said that one day all available men were grabbed and that they had to stand guard where a crashed disc had come down. Everything was being loaded onto trucks, and he couldn't understand why some of the truc ks had ice or something in them. He did not understand what they wanted to keep cold. Him and another guy had to ride in the back of one of the trucks, and although they were told that they could get into a lot of trouble if they took in too much of what was happening, they had a quick look under the covering and saw two dead bodies ... alien bodies. We really had to giggle at that bit. He said they were smaller than a normal man—about four feet—and had much Jarger heads than us, with slanted ey es, and that the bodies looked yellowish, a bit Asian-looking.

More- over, the same general descriptions of aliens can be found in most reports from people claiming to have seen them near their landed UFOs, in what has come to be known as \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind.\" The total of aliens recovered fr om the two crashes may be as high as eight: three dead and perhaps one live one from the Foster Ranch crash, and three de ad and one live from the Plains of San Agustin crash. Regardless of the tota l, there had to be sufficient body parts to keep a crew of top medical people busy for a very long time dissecting, analyzing, theorizing, and then writing about the most momentous event in the history of the biological sciences. Keeping such information secr et from the scientific commu- nity might be considered an act of unconscionable malfea- sance, as it is quite possible that the widespread dissemination of this information could have led to major advances in medi- cal and other sciences.

His notifica tion of higher headquarters, if it indeed ever happened, must not have produced the degree of concern that would have led to an order to \"cease transmis- sion\" received by Mrs. Sleppy on the afternoon of July 7.

Given that members of some special security team might well have been sitting on the edge s of their chairs in Washing- ton at the time the first word was receive d of the New Mexico crashes, how was it that news of the recovery of wreckage from the sheep ranch was allowed to ge t out via an official Army Air Forces news release? Was it a slip-up? Or might it have been the inevitable consequence of an unusually secretive process? The news that a system existe d for detecting alien crashes and then controlling all inform ation about them would, of necessity, have to be kept secr et from almost everyone in the government as well as outside it. Otherwise, the importance of the subject of alie n spacecraft could be come common knowl- edge, and the chances of mainta ining control would be seri- ously diminished. That the very idea was given credence had to be kept secret. Such a system involves and illu strates the nature of the intelligence practice of compar tmentalization.

Someone clearly had gotten wind of the discovery of crash wreckage at the sheep ranch se veral hours before Marcel and Cavitt had finished collecting de bris, or at least while they were on their way back to Roswel l with it. Could it have been that CICman Cavitt called his immediate superiors (not at Roswell, but at Albuquerque or even Washington) just as soon as Major Marcel described th e strange material to him by phone while telling him they we re going out to the ranch to collect more? Cavitt could easily ha ve been part of a system set up to alert some special, secret o ffice to flying saucer crashes, even if he didn't know why it was so important. Cavitt is one of the few people still living who were involved in the retrieval of crash materi als and who would have known a lot of details, rather than just a small part of the story. He is also one of two key witnesses wh o refuses to say anything; the other is the air base provost marshal—who, when called, said he could not talk because he si gned a security oath back in 1947.

To do this in a convincing manner, he had some one find just such a device, made certain it looked badly dama ged and presented it to the press. He then called in Wa rrant Officer Irving Newton from the base weather office, who promptly and correctly identified it as a weather balloon and its radar reflector. The press obligingly took notes and photographs of General Ramey and Major Marcel, and qu ickly put the story out on the wires: The \"crashed flying sau cer\" was no more than a weather balloon that had been misidentified by the rancher and the first military people to see it. Majo r Marcel had been ordered to keep quiet, and Captain Cavitt was nowhere to be seen. The military people who could easil y have spilled the beans had thus been taken care of.

This might account for the finding of a lot of unfamiliar parts. And while it could have initially fool ed sheep rancher Mac Brazel, it could hardly have posed much of a mystery for Maj. Jesse Marcel, whose years in Army Air Forces Intelligence had brought him into contact with, or at least awareness of, a wide variety of common and uncom mon air and space devices. Moreover, the presence of part numbers and writing on pieces of wreckage, even if in German, would quickly have revealed the smashed bits as something known. The presence of unknown and unreadable symb ols, on the other hand, would have pointed away from the wreck age being that of a V-2. The latter was the case. Chinese or Japanese sym bols would have been recognized as such, as wo uld Cyrillic, even if they could not be read. Major Ma rcel commented that the symbols looked something like Egyptian hieroglyph ics, but one is hard pressed to imagine an an cient Egyptian rocket or airplane being flown over New Mexico in 1947. As for the bodies that were found some distance from the debris field, some proponents of the rocket explanation suggest they were nothing more exotic than rhesus monkeys that had been lofted into near-space as part of a biological test program that would eventually lead to manned space flight. But rhesus monkeys, no matter how badly batt ered by the force of a crash, would still have looked enough like monkeys to have been recognized as such by the first experts to see them. And since the first V-2 carrying a live monke y (in Project Blossom) did not lift off until June 11, 1948, a nd then carried only one (named Albert), a crash eleven months ea rlier could hardly have been such a test. The big question of course re mains: Why would the crash of"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"A LTERNATIVE E XPLANATIONS FOR THE W RECKAGE 143 a test V-2, with or without m onkeys, have been treated as a military secret of ep ic proportions? Other ro cket test mishaps, with and without passengers, we re publicized with no great harm resulting. If the wreckage had been nothing more ex- treme than this, it would certai nly have been announced as such, and the entire matter comp letely defused for all time. The crash of an errant V-2 near the town of Jaurez, Mexico, a few weeks earlier (May 29, 1947) wasn 't kept secret. By handling the story as it did, the U.S. government provided the best possible reason for co ncluding that wh at crashed was truly mysterious. J APANESE B OMB - CARRYING B ALLOON This is the most recently concoc ted explanation for the Corona crash, and makes no more sens e than does the V-2 rocket explanation, and for some of the same reasons. From November 1944, through April 1945, the Japanese launched more than nine thous and crude, gas-filled balloons, each carrying fifty to seventy- five pounds of incendiary or high-explosive bombs. As many as a thousand of them may have ridden the prevailing winds all the way to North America. Damage from the bombs was limi ted to a few small fires and the deaths of six overly inqui sitive people on an outing who came across one in the woods. The balloons were thirty-three feet in diameter, made of laminated paper or rubberized silk, and carried a payload of more than three hundr ed pounds, most of which was the mech- anism which controlled the ba lloon's altitude as it drifted along. In order to frus trate the Japanese in their efforts to learn how effective the novel weapon was, the U.S. clamped down on news coverage and th us kept locations of the landings secret until the tragedy of May 1945. By then, launches had ceased due to the impact of American bombing ra ids on the manufac- turing and launching fa cilities in Japan. That the materials found on Foster Ranc h could have been from such a balloon and its payloa d is very hard to swallow."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"144 C RASH AT C ORONA The last launch from Japan was in early April 19 45, more than two years before the discovery of the wreckage. Where had the balloon been in the meantime? Not on the ranch, or Mac Brazel would surely have seen it many times. Could it somehow have been in flight all that time? At the average speed these balloons traveled, it would have made thirty-three trips around the world! With an altitude-contro lling mechanism designed for, at most, one week of descendi ng, dropping one or two sandbags, and then climbing back up to its cruising altitude, the balloon would have needed divine inte rvention to remain in flight until July 1947. Moreover, the wreckage, according to those who saw it, did not include a sing le scrap of anything similar to the remains of a Japanese balloon, many of wh ich had been r ecovered by the military and civilians in the fi nal months of World War II and thereafter. The payload section, for instance, was quite ordi- nary in appearance, being composed of conventionally shaped bits of inexpensive metal. Wh ile its purpose might not have been immediately obvious, its Japa nese origin would have been revealed quickly. Hundreds of ot hers had been rapidly identi- fied ... why not this one? The balloon bombs had not been a matter of military secu- rity since the May 22, 1945, joint announcement by the War and Navy departments that let the American people in on the scheme.

It was just superlight, superstrong pi eces of thin skin, of slender I beams, of parchmentlike substance, and of black plastic. To make this explanation wo rth considering seriously, one would have to accept that M ac Brazel was unable to recognize ordinary weather-balloon materials. Yet he stated that he knew what such balloons looked like, had recovered more than one, and was certain this was not such a device. He was not a stupid man, nor was Ma j. Jesse Marcel or others who saw the wreckage at the crash site, or soon afterward when the first loads were brought to Roswell Ar my Air Field. If Major Marcel had been so naive that he failed to identify pieces of a simple, common weather balloon 's reflector that was hardly worth a hurried trip to a remote sheep ranch on a Sunday afternoon, would he have been promoted shortly thereafter and given a much more important and sensitive job? A MERICAN S ECRET W EAPON There is always the possibility th at what crashed on the Foster ranch and even at the Plains of San Agustin was connected to the test flight of a secret Amer ican airplane or missile. This would account for its not being recognized by Mac Brazel, and for the way the entire episode was hu shed up. At any one time, secret vehicles are being tested in the wide open spaces of the West where the chances of their being seen accidentally are at a minimum. This was true in 1947 a nd it is certainl y true today. But what was being tested in 1947 is not secret today. Either it met its requirements and was placed in production, or it failed in one or more ways a nd was sent to the scrap heap. Regardless, it would have been declassified and long since would have become common knowl edge. By now, even if it had been totally successful, it woul d have been rendered obsolete by subsequent developments. Any remaining examples would probably be in museums. In 1947, the USAAF was very quietly testing the Bell XS-1 rocketpl ane (which would gain fame as"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"146 C RASH AT C ORONA the X-l in which Chuck Yeager became the first man to fly faster than the sp eed of sound on October 14, 1947). In July 1947 it was very secret. Today it hangs in the Milestones of Flight hall of the National Air and Space Museum in Washing- ton, D.C. Nothing about it remain s secret: not its shape, nor its power, nor its construction, nor its performance. In 1947, airplanes being tested at Muroc Army Air Field in southern California included the Northrop XB -35 flying wing heavy bomber, Convair XB-36 super-heavy bomber, North American XF-86 Sabre jet figh ter, and Douglas D-558-I Sky- streak research jet. None of th ese was ever invo lved in a mys- terious crash, nor was one flown as far afield as New Mexico. If what crashed in New Mexico in 1947 had been some secret American craft being tested, it would have been revealed as such many years ago and the mystery would have been solved to everyone's satisfac tion. But what was so strange about the finding at the sheep ranch was no t its radical configuration (it was just: scrap which suggested no particular shape) but its composition. The materials were limited to those having very unusual weight, strength, and markings. Had such materials been available to American airc raft and missile manufacturers in the late 1940s and afterward, they would have replaced the relatively inferior aluminum a lloys, titanium, special steels, and finally the advanced comp osites such as carbon fiber. Using materials of lesser quality when superior materials are available makes abso lutely no sense. Not even under condi- tions of excessive security.

In a ddition to all the reasons listed immediately above ca n be added the now- obvious inability of 1947 Soviet technology to have produced anyt hing half so ad- vanced as what cras hed in New Mexico.

Moreover, it makes absolutely no sense for the Soviets (or anyone else) to fly se cret experimental (a nd therefore highly sensitive) aircraft over the Unit ed States, where the slightest malfunction would lead to a forced landing or a crash. Priceless secrets and a clear pi cture of the state of the art would have been revealed, and nothing would have been gained. We test our secret aircraft over the em pty areas of Nevada and Califor- nia, where they will attract mi nimum attention. The Soviets tested theirs over equally vacan t parts of their huge country.

How does a li ttle weather balloon and its flimsy, box kitelike radar reflector become spread out over more than six hundred acres? When a weather balloon comes to earth, it is either because it has developed a slow leak and cannot maintain its altitude or because it has gone too high, split, and let its helium gas escape more rapi dly. Either way, the balloon descends in a pretty leis urely fashion. Disabled bal- loons do not come hurtling to earth like diving airplanes or reentering spacecraft. They floa t or flutter down, doing pre- cious little damage to themselves or to anything on the ground when they hit. If the balloon, or what was left of it, had no choice but to alight gently, what could have caused its payload to smash into so many pieces that they could cover a square mile of sheep ranch? Obviously, nothing! The metal foil and sticks that made up the radar reflector would have been bent or even broken, while the balloon itself would almo st certainly ha ve still been in one piece.

The scientific community, like the press, played a much bigger role in this than anyone could have realized at the time.

A day or two after the start of the major recovery effort, and almost a week after the crash at the ranch, the rest of the craft was located several miles from where the original debris had been found. At about the same time, three (or possi- bly four) bodies were found in what was assumed to be escape capsules, within a mile or two of the main body of the craft. This discovery was probably made from the air, by airplanes or helicopters from Ro swell AAF or some n earby base such as Alamogordo. Once trucks had brought back as much of the wreckage as they could carry to Ro swell AAF, it had to be stored in a large, secure building, where it was gua rded carefully while trusted men inside packed it for shipment to locations where it could be calmly studied, tested, and analyz ed. The bodies had to be pre- served against further deterioration, using whatever techniques could be adapted from contemporary embalming practice.

Or even, by our standards, if they communicate at all? Those who had gotten closest to living aliens in the early part of the 1947 wave of flying saucer sigh tings were pilots whose airplanes had been buzzed or paced in flight . For a pilot, the simplest form of communication—and the most fa- miliar—is rocking his wings. It says \"Hello, do you see me?\" The nighttime counterpart of th is is flashing one's landing lights and looking for a similar signal in return. Neither of these techniques involves the tr ansfer of much information but is merely a fr iendly acknowledgement. There have been many reports of pilots, motorists, and even campers with flashlights who have gotten a response from UFOs, but never of an organized scientific effort to say \"Hi, there! We know you're there a nd want to get to know you!\" Still, the need to co mmunicate must have b een so great that the silliest of schemes would be preferable to none at all. Probably the first attempts at communication were spon- taneous, by pilots rocking their wi ngs, flashing their lights, and even trying to call the UFO cr ew by radio.

It had to be faced that we were—and may still be—operating from a position of gross ignora nce. We didn't know how to communicate or if the aliens had any interest in hearing from us. They might have seen us as no more than the equivalent of white rats in a laboratory: Wh at medical researcher spends much time wondering if the rats are trying to communicate with him? Or it could have been that the vast differences in culture and biology could make communication all but impos- sible even if the atte mpt were being made, as it has long been with dolphins.

Mankind's position at the very top of the evol utionary lad- der, considered a source of im mense pride for eons, was sud- denly placed in serious jeopardy. The absolute ru ler of all the Earth (and presumably everywhere else, too) was on the verge of being revealed as inferior in some re spects to those about whom he knew nothing and of whose very existence he was uncertain. Someone had been flying thr ough Man's private skies in vehicles vastly superior to a nything developed here on Earth. And even though at least one of them had crashed, they were clearly the product of a civilization having far greater knowl- edge of science and technology. Man might still claim to be the master of the Earth, but suddenl y there was proof that someone else was smarter, ha d started sooner, or had progr essed faster. Man might still be able to divert great rivers, clear vast forests, tame wild horses, and teach puppydogs to sit up. But the de- signers, builders, and pilots of the UFOs had awe-inspiring knowledge (if not nece ssarily wisdom) and could well be in position to submit Man to their own will. Within two weeks of the start of the first great American wave of UFO sightings in 1947, it had become obvious that the strange craft were far faster a nd more maneuverable than any known flying machines. Moreover, they could fly almost si- lently and seemed capable of co ntrolling their radar profile. Any realistic chance that they mi ght be the tools of some other country was wiped out by the discovery of the remains of two crashed examples in the wilds of New Mexico.

By restricting knowledge of the aliens' activities to the government's chosen advisers and thus losing potentially priceless advice from knowledgeab le outsiders, it slowed the process of learning about the al iens and working out ways to deal with their presence. It also put off the day of reckoning, when our government would finall y be called to task for its peculiar behavior. Of course, the government ma y have had good reasons for keeping the initial news of the di scovery of aliens secret. . . or at least it may have thought it had good reasons. At first, it feared the \"flying discs\" might be some terribly advanced form of Soviet aircraft or missiles de veloped by captured Nazi scien- tists. In the early postwar peri od, nothing would have been more frightening than the prosp ect of the overflight of ad- vanced Soviet weapon s, and so the eagerne ss to keep the facts quiet was understandable. At l east until it became obvious that the mysterious flying th ings were just too far advanced to be the result of any Soviet-Nazi coll aboration. Since we knew they weren't ours, and no other nation on Earth could have made the required technical prog ress, the possibility of their being alien had to be faced. But until we knew for certain who was responsible for the flying discs and that they were no t a threat to national security, it must have seemed prudent to remain silent. The discovery of proof of the discs' alien na ture answered one of the big questions, but there still remain ed the possibility that they were unfriendly. Their failure to zap anyone with Buck Rogers- style ray guns might be evidence of subtlety, rather than friendliness. Despite the brilliantly effectiv e security system imposed by the U.S. government, the facts of the flying discs appearance and behavior could not be hidden forever, as they were being seen and reported publicly by thousands of people, among whom were scores of professional pilots, scientists, engineers, and others whose knowledge and skill made their reports be- lievable despite the bizarre conten t.

L acking any other explanation for the most baffling UFO repor ts, more and more people as- sumed they were alien in orig in, even though they knew of no direct evidence of this. As for the aliens' motives, they were a lot harder to under- stand. Most people figured they were explori ng Earth and its people for reasons of sc ientific curiosity, b ecause that is what we plan to do when we get to other planets. Their continued presence in large numbers for at least several decades suggests, however, that if they are explorer s, they may be slow learners, or we may be particularly hard to figure out (which would give Man at least a temporary boost in self-esteem). But for most of the modern era of UFOs, no other motivation on the part of the UFO operators was given serious consideration. Until 1981, when New York author Budd Hopkins began to take a close look at the strangest of all the parts of the UFO mystery: so-called al ien abductions. These short-term kidnap- pings of people by apparent alie ns, most of which involve puz- zling procedures resembling medical examinations, first became public in the mid-1960s with the publication of The Interrupted Journey by John Fuller. He de scribed the extraordi- nary experiences of Barney an d Betty Hill, whose return from an otherwise normal va cation included a side trip into history. In the following decade, a few similar stories came to light, but generally remained with in the UFO community.

It is the contention of Hopkins and other serious investiga- tors that the \"aliens\" are c onducting genetic experiments on thousands of innocent people —often over several genera- tions—and even using them to produce hybrid o ffspring. The researchers freely admit this s ounds outlandish but insist the evidence supports it. If this is the case, and there is some reason to believe the U.S. government is aware of it, then its re luctance to open its most secret UFO files becomes mo re understandabl e. The govern- ment is charged with the res ponsibility of protecting the pub- lic from foreign threats, and any admission that aliens are having their way with hundreds of Americans coul d well lead to political disruption.

But once the idea of genuine UFOs in the sky had been recognized, then it would be a short step to the acceptance of more direct approaches. After all, the government had admitted lying about the very existence of UFOs ! Why assume any of its other denials were based on reality? Of course, you, the president, could stick to the old party line and continue to insist there are no UFOs at all. Each time there has been a major flurry of sightings in the past, the press showed signs of losing confidence in official explanations. But then, after the furor died down , everything went back to the way it had been before. UFOs were forgotten by almost every- one, since nothing had resulted fr om their presence, just the way it would have been if they had never been here in the first place. But there is a serious risk in making repeated denials in the face of a growing mass of eviden ce from more and more expert witnesses. If the public and/or the press ever decide the govern- ment has been dishonest in it s handling of the UFO question, then all is lost. Nothing the pres ident says will be believed, and even the most outlandish rumo rs may be accepted, in the absence of a dependable , official source of information that is responsive to the public need.

Or do you release it in carefully measured doses, observing the response of the \"pa tient\" to the \"medicine\" in order to determine what to do next? You are taking a very large risk that the release of the first bits of news will unleash a tidal wave of press curiosity that you will not be ab le to control. If you tell the people that UFOs are (or even were) flying overhead, they may accept that and think no more of it. Or they may decide that if you are willing to admit that much, there must be more to it, and so th ey may be receptive to reports (authoritative or sensa tional) of landings, cr ashes, confronta- tions, and abductions. If you have the time, you may be able to conduct some tests of public reaction, releasing a small amount of relatively mild inform ation to a limited audience and carefully monitoring the re actions. But if you are under pressure as a result of waiting until the last moment in hopes they will go away, this may not be possible and you'll just have to take your chances. The real danger lies in the nature of the information you have been withholding. If it is fairly beni gn, then the risks are minimal. But if it is truly sh ocking, it may be worth almost any risk to keep it from becoming public knowledge. The least upsetting possibility is that while UFOs may have been cruising through our skie s for uncounted decades, they have never given any in dication of being unfri endly, or of inter- acting with us. If that is the case, then the main risk is to Man's pride. Long accustomed to seei ng himself as the ultimate ex- ample of power and knowledge, capable of overcoming any challenge to his stature, Man's realization that there are those flying right over our heads who have superior technology and are able to proceed with impuni ty could be a severe blow.

Still others, however, may find the news highl y upsetting, especially if they have accepted the years of official denials as \"proof\" that UFOs cannot exist as a nything different and important. Then the past will co me back to haunt those who, for one reason or another, made author itative-sounding statements discrediting UFOs, their observe rs and all those who found them interesting. The most flamboyant proponents of UFO reality (saucer fans, New-Age believer s, tabloid editors) will no doubt make certain that the world knows how far-sighted they were. This will add to the difficulty of keep ing the public calm. But as long as UFOs are seen as having come no closer than a few thousand feet overhead, it s hould be possible to convince most people that nothing traumatic is about to happen.

Visions of hideous, sl obbering monsters from science fiction movies will trigger far too many imaginations, in the absence of calming facts. While the information will spre ad more slowly by word of mouth, it will have a secondary effect of damaging the govern- ment's credibility as th e public realizes that it is not being told the full story and that its leader s cannot be trus ted. The public, for the most part, might still a ccept the staggering news and learn how to go about its business . Even if the weird idea of \"alien abductions\" becomes an accept ed part of life, such expe- riences are brief and rarely produce long- term physical harm, and open discussion might redu ce the psychological damage.

Why worry about threats from other countries when a much more ominous th reat cruises right above us? With the drop in the value of defense stocks would come similar drops in the value of st ocks of hundreds of firms doing defense-related work, especially in research and development. A stock market crash of epic pr oportions is easy to envision, and would be followed by the la yoff of hundreds of thousands of blue-collar and white-collar employees and the rapid failure of all sorts of service and support businesses. A deep depression could well follow in a very short time. This alone could be keeping th e U.S. government (in concert with others) from releasing the news of the ex istence and na- ture of UFOs. What president would want to go down in his- tory as the space-ag e Herbert Hoover, with the blame for a financial catastrophe on his reco rd? Of course, if the news could be let out slowly, so that the economy could adjust to the new demands a little at a time, th en a deep crisis might be averted. But, as we have sugges ted, the chances of pacing the release of informati on may not be very good. Even if the financial situation could be controlled, there are other elements in our culture that might not react as well. Religion, for example. How would the major organized reli- gions react to the presence of aliens in our midst? No doubt many of them would immediatel y claim the aliens as their own, convinced that living, in telligent beings from anywhere must have come to the same conclusions on matters of philoso- phy and dogma as they had.

If these obviously a dvanced beings function well without a recognizable deity, the need for religion as we know it would be diluted if not elimin ated. The response of the major churches will tell the story, and experience does not suggest basis for optimism. In the broad and increasingly im portant areas of science and technology, the realizat ion that others are decades, centuries, or perhaps millennia ahead of us could be a blow to the collec- tive ego from which we would never recover. So many of the world's best thinkers are involved in the systematic search for new and better ways of doing thin gs that to destroy their mo- tivation to do original wo rk could be devastating.

The number of scenarios is limited only by the imagination. If we are faci ng a catastrophe, are they prepar- ing to save some or all of us? Are they preparing to review our response? Will this be an incenti ve for us to be subservient to them? We just don't know. What if it turns out that the al iens are really the gods of the Bible? That is, the all-powerfu l beings who have been here before, done their thing, left, a nd now come back to throw their technological hat into the ring? Suppose they had been here two thousand years ago and had s ubsequently traveled at al- most the speed of light so th at time slowed down for them while it went on for the people th ey left behind? They might be the same beings who were here in Jesus' time, and had left Jesus or other religious leaders behind and are now back to check on how things had gone. That so unds like science fiction, but when you recognize the Einstein ian relativity indicates that for people traveling at extremel y high speed time slows down, then we have the startling possib ility that we are an old experi- ment being evaluated.

It may also be that the reason for aliens coming here is purely economic. What do we have that might interest aliens? One thing might be biological ma terial. It coul d be the DNA that belongs to people and of which we have many variations on the human theme—incredible variations of defects, strengths, weaknesses. And ther e is also plant and animal DNA, genetic structural material . We have an undifferentiated biological population with, for ex ample, ten thousand varieties of sorghum. Whatever characteris tics you want, there are prob- ably a few seeds with those characteristics. The same holds for fish and mammals, many species and varieties of which have been around for a very long time. If , in the alien society, they have learned to control repr oduction under laboratory condi- tions for people, animals, and plants, it may be that a new disease has arisen. It may be th at they need certain charac- teristics because they want to explore places where their own biological make-up is inappropr iate. One can imagine innu- merable combinations of their genes and ours that might fit their specialized ne eds. We don't know.

We (the aliens) got here in the 1940s be cause we detected growing technology. They (humans) had managed to kill forty million of their own in a great war, and destroyed mu ch of their, own planet. The next thing they did, rather than figure out how to live at peace with each othe r, was to develop competing groups with new wea pons of great destru ctive capabilities and then let \"great leaders\" kill mill ions more of their own in their \"enlightened self-interest.\" This (Earth) is a society in serious trouble, as it seems to have developed mostly along the line of devising ever more efficient ways of killing its own. Do we want them to move out into space, or should they be kept on Earth? In view of their own attitude to ward life, they surely can't object to our doing a few biological experiments on them. We may have borrowed a few thousa nd of them, wh ile they allow tens of thousands of children to die every day from preventable disease and starvation. How can they complain about what we do?

In view of our own difficulty in understanding ourselves, imagine how much more fascinating we may appear to aliens. Some of the most pecu liar behavior of UFOs (a disc flying with its broad side forward, for example, or flipping end- over-end) could be analogous to a professor shocking his psy- chology class with so me seemingly irrational act just to see how they will react.

From one brave man flying for thirty-four hours in a poorly equipped and hard-to-fly single-seater, we now have ten million people flying every year across the A tlantic in just six or seven hours. Many go for reasons which once would have been considered trivial but are perfectly acceptable because the trip is now so easy. If it took six months to get there, you wouldn't go to London for a weekend. If aliens have been flying betw een stars for scores of genera- tions or for millions of years, they could have as many reasons for coming to Earth as we have for going to New York City: good ones, bad ones, indifferent ones; personal ones, very pub- lic ones; immediate ones and long-term ones; happy ones and sad ones. Instead of trying to figure out what single purpose motivates aliens to visit here, perhaps we should be consider- ing a wide range of co ncurrent possibilities."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"I MPLICATIONS 191 As for the reason or reasons our own governmen ts continue to insist they are not here at all, maybe they know something so upsetting that our knowing it won't help. Maybe something awfu l is happening, or is soon to happen, or could happen someday, and th e prospect could disturb our way of life without helping to improve the situation. Even a hint of impending tragedy c ould be enough to cause a major uproar. It is also possible that, just as Moses was kept out of the Promised Land because he was of the older generation that, knew slavery, our governments coul d be waiting until all the, old, narrow-minded military leader s have died, or at least re- tired. Max Planck, the great German physicist, said, \"New ideas come to be acce pted not because thei r opponents come to believe in them, bu t because their oppone nts die and a new generation grows up that is accustomed to them.\" For the first time in history, we have a new generation that has never known a time when th ere wasn't a manned space program. Saturday-morning cartoons, television series like Star Trek, movies, and the evening ne ws have combined to \"brainwash\" young people into space-consciousness. Why are the aliens here? Wher e are they from? What, if anything, are their plans for us ? Why haven't they presented themselves formally, rather th an remaining as inconspicuous as possible? Why are governments determined to keep their presence secret? Lacking any know ledge of the aliens' psyches, we have no way to delve into their behavior. And lacking any entree to the most secret room s in the Pentagon, we have no way to delve into the behavior of our own people vis-a-vis the aliens. For almost a half-century of intense UFO activity in our atmosphere and on ou r ground, the data have piled up, as have the theories. But despite the effo rts put into trying to solve the great mystery of the twentieth century, we ma y be no closer today then we were when UFOs crashed in the open spaces of New Mexico and the government easily fooled us all into thinking it was part of a weather balloon."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":" wo VERY STRANGE devices crashed in central New Mexico in July 1947. They were not weather balloons, or test rockets, or secret military airplanes. By every indication, what crashed were tw o alien spacecraft, along with their crews of small humanoids. Dozens of firsthand and secondh and witnesses have attested to the details of the crashes, to the retrievals of wreckage and bodies by the military, to their shipment out of New Mexico aboard military aircraft, and to the thorough and continuing cover-up by the U.S. government of perhaps the most impor- tant event in the pa st thousand years. Except for a few hours on July 8, the story remained com- pletely hidden for more than thirty years, thanks to an unusu- ally effective job of government disinformation. It began to emerge only in 1978 when one of the firs t two military men to reach the scene of the Corona crash told his story to one of the authors. Slowly, more witne sses were found and added their testimony, enabling a more comple te picture to be assembled. Hundreds and possibl y thousands of men and women have been involved in the hu ge, costly official effo rt to cope with the crashes, to transpor t, examine, and stor e wreckage and bodies and house at least one live alie n, to learn who and what was involved and to keep it all se cret. Those who initiated this process are long gone, and most of the others have successfully maintained their anonymity. But more and more public- spirited citizens are co ming forth with new bits of information to help clarify this very complex matter. 192 T"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"C ONCLUSION 193 Had it been generally realized b ack in 1947 that two vehicles from another advanced civiliza tion had smashed into the New Mexico desert, mankind's mode rn history would certainly have been changed. As it is, that history has been walled up within the Pentagon and in various intelli gence agencies where a select few know of it. The peop le of the world have been kept ignorant of a pair of events of incalculable proportions. The U.S. government continue s to insist that nothing of importance happened at Corona or San Agustin; that, in fact, nothing at all happened there! Its ab ility to maintain this position in the face of a growing collection of testimony from those who were there cannot survive forever. A great deal has been accomp lished by the au thors and by others who have dedicated much of their lives to the search for the truth about the New Mexico events. But much remains to be done before those in high po sitions realize they have a moral duty to the American people to tell them what really happened almost two generations ago. Th e cold war is over.
