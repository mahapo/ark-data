In a single two-week period in the summer of 1947, the UFO problem was laid in confusing disorder before the American public by means of banner headlines and wire-stories in profusion. In retrospect, it seems clear that the visible record of 1947 emergen ce of the UFO problem is primarily a journalistic record. Although scientists, the military, and a few governmental spokesmen took minor parts in the dramatic entry of UFOs onto the modern scene, newspapermen wrote and delivered the key lines that made the journalists role in the drama preeminent. Hence, to reconstruct that eventful public emergence of the UFO problem, one must turn to the nation's newspapers a nd review the day-by-day (sometimes hour-by- hour) unfolding of the eviden ce -- evidence that somethi ng of truly unusual nature was occurring. A few writers have already nibbl ed at the edge of a journalistic review of that curtain-raising two-week ep isode in late June and ear ly July, 1947. In the present book, Bloecher gives us what will probably come to be regarded as the definitive analysis of that important episod e in UFO and journalistic history. His approach was straightfo rward: Because his professional work takes him to many parts of the country, he began severa l years ago to devote maximum possible time to digging into local library files of newspapers, in order to extract original 1947 press material reporting the UFO problem in all its dimensions. As his files grew he turned to other sources, including Air For ce Project Blue Book files and files of independent investigatory groups. From all this, he has assembled and put into far clearer order than could have been appare nt to 1947 readers a systematic recounting of the 1947 birth of the UFO problem. This book is the result of his studies. I commend it to the attention of all se rious students of the UFO problem. ( iii ) Doubtless, most other read ers will be as stunned as I was to realize that already in the first two week s after Kenneth Arnold's Mt. Rainier report of June 24, 1947, press reports of other American si ghtings of highly unconventional aerial objects numbered not the dozen or so that most of us might recall, but many hundreds. Since Bloecher is careful to con cede that his own sear ching cannot possibly have gleaned every last report from the 1947 press files, we can safely round upwards his collection of about 800 reports to an esti mate that at least some thousand sightings of unidentified objects probably occurred within the United States in midsummer 1947, the bulk of these coming within a rath er sharply defined wavecrest centered on about July 7. As Bloecher properly emphasizes, this clearly marks the episode as one of the outstanding sighting-waves on record."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" (It would be most unwise to draw the conclusion that a thousand reports in about two weeks earns this episode the dist inction of being the outstanding wave on record; unfortunately no other UFO resear cher has done for other American waves the same kind of diligent searching that Bloecher has accomplished for the 1947 episode. Thus, the November 1957, episode might well outstrip the 1947 summer episode, if only there were reasonably full documentation at hand. And then, there are foreign waves in the running, too; Sept ember-October, 1954, as Michel's work has shown, constituted a most remarkable UFO sighting-wave in France and nearby parts of Europe.) In the two decades that have passed since 1947, there has been distressingly little progress made towards elucidating th e true nature of the unidentified flying objects. But, elucidated or not, they have refused to go away. Press fun-poking and curiously fallacious official \"explanations\" ha ve most assuredly held up real scientific progress by conveying the dist inct impression that the UF O problem has been only a nonsense problem. But ridicule and snide comments notwithstanding, citizens in all walks of life have continued to report, often in the deepest puzzlement and often in a state of suddenly-enhanced concern, that they have witne ssed objects fitting no conventional natural or technological categor ies -- unidentifiable aerial objects of craft-like nature. This being so, it seems long overdue for the scie ntific community to put aside arrogance and prejudgment, to overlook preconceptions and past glib comments about all the unbalanced persons wh o just don't know what they are seeing, and to dig into the facts. That those \"facts\" are, toda y, not objective instrumental meter-readings but anecdotal accounts of things seen by persons other than Nobelists, is unfortunate. If only science had not b een so casual back in 1947, so ready to believe what so many feature-writers and il l-informed official spokesmen had to say about UFOs, we might today have an abundance of meter-readings with which to work. But 1947 began a two-decade period of misinformation, so we are still hardly at the start of an adequate scientific examination of UFOs. ( iv ) To understand how that lamentable situation came about, one must begin by reviewing the manner in which various pa tterns of reaction to the UFO problem became established almost within days of the Arnold report. Bloecher’s work lays before us a fascinating summary of those crucial days of initial journalistic confrontation of the UFO puzzle. To keep the record entirely clear, it is necessary that I draw special attention to the adjective \"journalistic\" in that last sentence. Bloecher does not here purport to present results of his own investigative reporting of UFO sightings in mid-1947. Nor is he able to vouch, on the basis of independent checking, for the reportorial accuracy of the hundreds of press accounts whose rise and fall he explores. Since we all know that standard press reporting falls well sh ort of 100 per cent accuracy, we must not here equate press reports to scientific accounts. To form my own estimates of the probable order of reliability of these 1947 reports, I undertook a search for witnesses in several dozen of the more intriguing 1947 cases discussed in the text. The results of this sampling were interesting; they"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"were also encouraging in the sense that they pointed to the generally correct impression one draws from reading all thes e press accounts: Even after reportorial errors and the like are allowed for, the mid-1947 episode seems to constitute a period of remarkable sightings by many level-headed persons. In the course of my cross- checks, I found that the UFO problem has been with us so long that some key witnesses of the 1947 period are already dead. Others have moved away from the locales of their 1947 sightings and are not any longer to be found by the type of telephone-searching to which my own check had to be limited. A few, but only very few, have forgotten key details of what they saw and reported; but most emphasized the vividness with which they can still recall the unusual objects they saw, or the unprecedented performance characteristics that stunned them, back there twenty years ago. In my search, I found one out right hoax that was exposed within a day of the initial press report. The victim gave full deta ils to the same reporte rs that put the hoax on the wires; they weren't interested in clearing up the hoax, and it stood uncorrected in the files for Bloecher to add to his initial collection. ( v ) And in the search I found ma ny cases in which details of the sightings were erroneously reported, both in local and in wire stories. Newspaper reporting, to repeat, leaves a great deal to be desired in the way of accuracy -- whether journalists care to admit it or not. But what I found to be true from the checks I was able to make on about twenty-five more or less randomly selected 1947 cases for which I was able to locate one or more key witnesses was th is: Even after one corrected the reporters' errors (wrong times, wrong directions, wrong shapes, wrong names, etc.), one still had left a high percentage of exceedingly interesting and basically unexplainable accounts of unconventional aeri al objects. And frequently I found by telephone- interviewing of the witnesses that there was much more significance to the full sighting account than th e original reporter had been ab le to put into his own press story. Hence, I feel justified in asserting that Bloecher's account is much more than a journalistic review per se; I believe the picture that ta kes shape as one reads his account is a generally quite correct picture, the random defects of which are admittedly unfortunate but do not spoil the over-all image of an episode of great scientific significance. I believe that it is important that many more such st udies now be undertaken -- with resources that permit a full recheck of th e type that I was able to conduct merely on a small-sample basis. Many physical scientis ts (unlike their conf reres in the social sciences) scorn interview methods of acqui ring data. I share their strong preference for meter-readings; but I depl ore their unwillingness to l ook at anecdotal data when that's all there is immediately at hand. To escalate concern for the UFO problem to the level where funds and energies will he poured into the design of objective techniques of data-gathering (electromagne tic sensors, improved radar reporting, etc.) will require that science begin by carefully sifting anecdotal data. A first step therein"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"is that of assembling reports; and for th e mid-1947 episode Bloecher has done just that for us. The point I stress is that my own sample-check convinces me that the bulk of these 1947 reports must be viewed as reasona bly well reported. This, in itself, carries very important implications. For it implies that within about two weeks hundreds and hundreds of American citizens saw phenomena for which science has no ready explanations. Venus, fireballs, sundogs, and the rest of the \"m isidentified natural phenomena\" of which we have subsequently heard so much in official disclaimers, must be suspected in many more than a fe w of those reports. But then, as now, one has a large residue of quite inexplicable phenomena reported by persons who appear to be entirely sane, reliable, and often very articulate. And here and there, one finds true gems of the world of reports, cases where highly experienced persons saw objects which they could describe in no othe r terms than \"machines\" or \"craft\" or \"vehicles\" -- UFOs, briefly. ( vi ) What I see in all this as primarily important is the abundance of good case- material scattered through a dross of less reliable reports -- an a bundance that official agencies should have recognized by late 1947 as constituting a problem of the utmost scientific importance. No such recognition appears to have occurred. The U. S. Army Air Force (which became the U. S. Air Force in January, 1948) quite naturally acquired official responsibility for the UF O problem before 1947 was over; there was understandable concern that these supersoni c discs might be weapons of some hostile foreign power. They were maneuvering in our airspace, so our air force received and retained (or, as some subsequent deve lopments suggest, couldn't get rid of) the responsibility for clarifying the mystery of the UFOs. Project Sign was created formally within the new U. S. Air Force on January 22, 1948, seven short days after USAF acquired its separate status within our Department of Defense. Project Sign, followed by Project Grudge and Project Blue Book, became the administrative vehicles in which headway was supposed to be made towards the goal of explaining the UFOs. In fact, those vehicles made almo st no net progress; so one now looks back on twenty years of confusion and ineptitude, and one asks how it was ever possible that this bulk of evidence that burst out in mid-1947 became, itself, the greatest body of officially \"misinterpreted phenomena\" in scientific history. One must, I believe, read Bloecher's work with that question clearly in mind. How could so much evidence be brushed aside, ignored, and made fun of? How was the significance of the UFO reports widely ignored already in 1947 ? Historians of science are, I believe, doomed to incredulity that so much evidence got lost in an admi nistrative shuffle and became only a first stratum underlying twenty-years-later deposits of more such startling evidence for the existence of a new scientific problem of extraordinary interest. I write these introductory comments at a moment when I have behind me about eighteen months of intensive examination of the UFO problem. That examination has convinced me that, far from being a nonsense problem, the UFO problem is perhaps the outstanding scientific problem confronting mankind. Those are strong words, and I intend them to be; they are not lightly written. I believe we"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"must radically reorient scientific attitude s towards this steadil y-growing body of UFO reports and that we must enlist the aid of really top-notch scientific talent in the difficult task of bringing ultimate order out of the chaos into which twenty years of ridicule have brought the subject. ( vii ) Bloecher's study has, for me , brought out at least one very significant insight into the \"ridicule-lid\" that has so long ke pt the bulk of the UFO evidence from open scrutiny. The populace itself has well-imprinted patterns of rejection of observations that do not seem to fit within the established world scientific picture. I shall enlarg e a bit on this. I have s een so much press and official ridicule of UFO witnesses in the course of my r ecent study that I have evidently overlooked somewhat the ingrained tendency for even unt rained laymen to be reluctant to report openly something they have seen with thei r own eyes when it flies in the face of familiar experience. Bloecher's material s hows, on close inspection, that even before any Air Force pronouncements, before any pres s-reported scientific scoffing in early July, 1947, witnesses were exhibiting quite definite reluctance to report the unprecedented aerial phenomena they had seen. This, for social scientists, deserves bold underscoring as an index of the scientific attitudes of our times. I smiled to hear an eminent American physicist deplore, on a recent television program, the public's credulity as evidenced by its willingness to take seriously the \"f lying saucer\" reports. He shook his head in dismay that years of scientific educati on of the public had produced so little effect. In fact, he need have little wo rry on that score. Anyone who has done a substantial amount of direct w itness-interviewing in UFO cases knows all too well how unwilling most persons (even those with no formal scientific training) have become with respect to open reporti ng of UFO sightings. But what I see in Bloecher's early press material is surprising evidence that this reluctance predates official and journalistic fun-poking concerni ng \"flying saucers.\" Science has built into our population a very definite resistance towards acceptance of the odd and unusual, the bewildering and inexplicable. Exceptions there are, needless to say, but the bulk of the populace tends to be qu ite close-mouthed about observations of unexplainable phenomena. This disposition was quickly and powerfully enhanced by official scoffing, by scientific pronouncements made ex cathedra by the end of the first week of July, 1947, and since repeated over and over. But that disposition, Bloecher's studies reveal, was not created by thos e pronouncements. This I find exceedingly interesting, exceedingly significan t, and rather surprising. It might be pertinent, if space permitted, for me to give a summary of the roughly two dozen 1947 cases which I succe eded in checking in my sampling. I found it especially inte resting to speak with a number of police and sheriff's deputies in the Portland, Oregon, area concerning th e unusual July 4, 1947, sightings. ( viii ) This episode is officially e xplained in Air Force files as \"radar chaff\"(aluminum strips dropped to confuse enemy radar) , yet it involved repeated sightings of numerous disc- shaped objects moving rapidly across the daytime sky over Portland. To listen to"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"those officers retell what they saw, how th ey reacted, and how th eir colleagues ribbed them was more than amusing. But to try to square all those sightings with \"radar chaff\" is simply annoying; the evidence bears absolutely no resemblance to observations of falling radar chaff. And so it has gone, over the ensuing years. One 1947 case that does warrant more than passing mention here is a report that is not in Bloecher's ma terial because it was never re ported to press or official agencies. (One comes to realize that there must be a very large volume of other such reports that still lie fully covered by the ridi cule lid.) The report came directly to me from a Tucson woman who happened to re ad a Time article on UFOs (Aug. 4, 1967) that made passing mention of Arnold’s re port of \"seeing nine disc-like objects erratically moving through the air near Mount Rainier in 1947 .\" Thinking that here, at last, must be a confirmatory report of what she and a friend had seen in early 1947 in Tucson, and noting my name in the same article, she telephoned me, thinking that I might be interested to know that she ha d seen \"the same nine objects.\" But by the time we had gone over details, it was not obvious that she had seen the same objects as Arnold; but it was clear that her report must be entered into the UFO record. Here is a brief summary: Mrs. H. G. Olavick and Mrs. William Down were the witnesses, and the date was Tuesday, April 29, 1947, according to Mrs. Olavick's reconstruction of related events and dates. (the re is a possibility th at this date is one week off, she pointed out; but that it was a Tuesday in late April or early May she regards as quite definite.) Mrs. Olavick was in her kitchen at 2101 East Hawthorne Street, Tucson, while Mrs. Down was out in the backyard patio. Suddenly Mrs. Down called her out excitedly, and both proceeded to observe what had caught Mrs. Down's eye. The time was just after the noon hour; Tucson's skies were completely cloudless. Somewhat north of their zenith lay an unus ual, isolated, \"steamy-fleecy\" cloud at an altitude which Mrs. Olavick found difficult to estimate, though she recalled that it seemed lower than average for that time of year (thus, perhaps at or below 10,000 feet, say). No other cloud was to be seen in the sky. In and out of the cloud moved a number of dull-white disc-like objects th at rose and fell in an erratic manner, occasionally disappearing into or above the unnatural cloud. She said that these objects were round in planform but were not spherical, for they frequently tipped a bit, exposing a flattened-sphere form. She estimates that they watched these objects cavorting near the cloud for perhaps five or six minutes before the entire group suddenly disappeared within the cloud or perhaps above it. ( ix ) After a minute or so, as she now recalls it, a new object, perhaps three or four times as large as the littl e objects, came out of the cloud on its east side. After it emerged, the small objects began to emer ge also, taking up a V-formation pattern behind it. The V comprised a line of four-abr east just to the rear of the large object, then a line of three-abreast behind that, a nd finally two-abreast in the rear. Thus, the point of the V was to the r ear (in the sense of the emer gent and subsequent motion). This formation permitted the first accurate count of the small objects, nine in all. No sooner had the last pair emerged than a ll ten objects shot off to the northeast, climbing out of sight in a time that she thought was probably two to three seconds. She does not recall what happened to the cloud after the ten ob jects departed."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" I have spoken with Mrs. Olavick several additional times, following her first call. Her account was presented in an une mbellished manner, and her descriptions were carefully framed, specifying just whic h parts had become less distinct in her memory. But the basic vividness of her memory of this observation she stressed repeatedly. I had to explain that it was by no means clear that the objects she saw were identical with those reported by Ke nneth Arnold two months later. When I queried her as to why she had not reported them, she pointed out that she and Mrs. Down were entirely convinced that they had been fortunate enough to witness some new American military vehicles about wh ich the general public had not yet been informed. Later she heard of the \"flying sa ucers,\" and she and Mrs. Down, when they rejoined their husbands in mid-summer in Iowa, told them about their own observation. The husbands, she recalled, made such a joke of it that they ceased mentioning it. Here was a pre-Arnold sightin g never reported officially. It was quite clearly not an observation of \"new American military vehicles,\" nor can one readily square this with any phenomenon of atmospheri c physics or astronomy. It is a UFO observation, and a rather inte resting one. Bloecher's search has led to several other pre-Arnold 1947 sightings. Just a matter of days before this writing, I spoke on the telephone with Walter A. Minczewski, the U. S. Weather Bureau observer whose April, 1947, theodolite-tracking ca se is cited in the text. Minczewski emphasized that he had never reported it to other than his Weather Bur eau superiors and hence was surprised to be called about it twenty years later. Yet his recollection of the details of the whitish disc-like object he had tracked one clear morning in Richmond, Virginia, was still distinct in his mind. ( x ) But time is slipping on, a nd those 1947 witnesses ought to be interviewed in far more depth than anyone has ever done -- lest we lose their reports forever. The same is true of the innumerable observers of subsequent UFO incidents. Detailed case-studies and thorough episode-studies are sorely needed. Bloecher has given here the raw material for an episode-study of the initial 1947 wave of sightings; he has woven it into an orderly account of what was happening when UFOs first became public knowledge. I find this account absorbing reading and regard it as a substantial contribution to the study of the baffling problem of the unidentified flying objects. James F. McDonald Institute of Atmospheric Phys ics University of Arizona Tucson, Arizona October 23, 1967 ( xi ) "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" Preface During the past five years, while on several extended tours of the country, I had the opportunity to examine the back ne wspaper files of many local libraries in search of news reports of unidentified flyi ng objects. I was particularly interested in obtaining information on the wave of si ghtings that had taken place during the summer of 1947, since few records of newspape r reports for that period are available. My search began in Portland, Oregon, where I knew that many sightings had been made. Not until I had consulted the local pape rs for the period, however, did I realize just how numerous those sightings had b een. Intrigued by these preliminary data, I continued to examine old newspaper reports in the libraries of other cities I visited. In city after city I discovered the same extrao rdinary fact: that UFOs had been seen and reported in incredible numbers in June a nd July of 1947. I was completely unprepared for the vast amount of descri ptive detail that lay buried in local papers. That this material had gone unnoticed for so many y ears was not really surprising, however, since in 1947 the subject was a novel one a nd few had any reason to believe it would persist, as it has. Therefore, no records were kept, other th an the Air Force's file of investigated reports. The public -- and many of ficials -- assumed that flying saucers were merely some sort of transitory phenomenon and would soon go away. While interest was high at the time of the sightings , it died out not long after the wave had subsided and was not revita lized until the following year , when a new flurry of reports was made. By that time, the 1947 repor ts were old hat and lay buried in the newspaper morgues of libra ries around the country. On subsequent trips and, particularly, during the period from July 1966 to June 1967, I searched for material from areas I had not visited before; I discovered that my earlier efforts had been just a beginning. I began sending copies of my notes to the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, in Washington, D.C., having been a member of that organizati on from its beginning early in 1957. These notes subsequently came to the attenti on of several people who felt, as I was beginning to, that the data were important enough to be made available to others involved in research on the subject. The mate rial presented a vivid picture, and a far more complete one than had previously b een available, of an important period of UFO activity -- a period that had hitherto been given little more than passing attention in the extensive lite rature on the subject. A special report was suggested as an appropriate means of making the data availa ble. Fortunately, it was possible to write the report at an appropriate time -- the tw entieth anniversary of the earlier events. To supplement the information I collected as I traveled, the newspaper files at the Library of Congress were consulted to fill in areas I had not visited on tour. In all, more than 140 newspapers were examined, representing over 90 cities and towns in 49 states, the District of Co lumbia, and Canada. Newspapers in Montana could not be consulted as I neither traveled there nor could find papers fo r that state at the Library of Congress. There are, however, references to several sightings in Montana that were carried by the wire services in other papers. Two other sources for refere nces were also consulted. The Air Force's Project Blue Book, at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, has in its files"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"approximately 60 official reports of sigh tings through the end of July 1947, and notes were made on about two-thirds of these; l ack of time prevented a complete coverage of this material. NICAP files also include a number of first-hand reports of sightings from the 1947 period; some of these came fr om the files of the now defunct Civilian Saucer Investigations of Los Angeles, which were turned over to NICAP after that organization discontinued its operations. A number of these reports are included. A few references have come from UFO publications and magazine articles as well. The completed report prov ides a chronological lis ting of more than 850 sightings made during June and July 1947. Th e sightings were made in 48 states, the District of Columbia, and Canada. This is basically a reference work and does not attempt to make a critical evaluation of every individual report, although certain cases have been selected as representing special aspects of UFO phenomena; these cases are given in more detail in Sections II , III, and IV. Newspapers have provided the basic source of information, Anyone who r eads the papers regularly has few illusions about the reliability of news reports; if an account is not distorted it is as often pitiably short of hard-core facts. But thes e news accounts serve to demonstrate, if only as quantitative evidence, the extraordinarily widesp read character of the 1947 UFO sightings. In a number of cases, Dr. James McDonald, senior physicist at the Institute of Atmospheric Physics, University of Arizona, has been able to contact the original witnesses and has thereby provided some indication of the general reliability of these news accounts. Most important, it is evident in these newspaper references that among the early sightings certain patterns of UFO appearance and behavior, usually thought of as a later development, we re in fact first observed and reported in the summer of 1947. Although a great amount of ma terial was found by this research, there remains even more; without having access to lo cal newspapers where many sightings occurred, it was impossible to obtain essential facts a bout these incidents. If a thorough search could be made of all ne wspapers throughout the country for this period, the total number of published sighting reports would, at a conservative estimate, be more than doubled. It would be enormously helpful if future readers of this report would consult their local libra ries to supplement the material already collected, and send additional information to NICAP. ( xiii ) One other significant fact points to the magnitude of the 1947 wave: again and again in news accounts reference is made to the hundreds of calls newspapers received, whereas only a fraction of thes e reports later appeared in the news accounts. In order to avoid confusi on over certain terms, the following definitions may be helpful to the reader. As used in this report, the term \"wave\" is any sudden and pronounced increase of UFO sightings on a nati onal scale, above what is ordinarily considered an average daily rate. According to an interview in the Christian Science Monitor for September 3, 1965, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, chief scientific consultant to the Air Force's Project Blue Book, said that in th e official files the average daily rate of sightings for the first 18 years of reports wa s one to two sightings per day. (Both the Air Force files and NICAP's indicate that this rate has risen in the past two years). If"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"an increase in sightings has apparently resulted from an undue amount of publicity over one or two reports, and on careful ex amination shows a large proportion of misidentifications of natural phenomena, it cannot be termed a genuine wave. The 1947 wave, which was unque stionably genuine, was not the first or last wave in this country, nor have UFO wave s been confined to the United States. A major wave occurred here in 1897, when la rge numbers of citi zens reported seeing what were then called \"airships;\" and just one year before the 1947 wave another had taken place in northern Europe, when hundreds of observations of \"ghost rockets\" were made. In this country other major waves occurred in March and April, 1950; July and August, 1952; November, 1957; A ugust, 1965; March and April, 1966; and possibly in February, 1967 -- but without the amount of news coverage usually associated with waves. All of these major increases in sightings should be examined in depth for similarities and differences as part of the over-all study of the UFO phenomenon. There have been increases of sightings in geographi cally isolated areas on numerous occasions, many times as part off a major wave but at other times independent of it. These are called \"concentrations.\" Notable domestic concentrations were reported in the Carolinas in Februa ry, 1953; the Ohio area, August, 1955; the Dakotas and Minnesota, November, 1956; northern California, August, 1960; New Mexico, April, 1964; Maryland and Virgin ia, January, 1965; New Hampshire, in September and October, 1965; and in Michig an and eastern Long Island, as part of the major national wave of spring, 1966. When a wave of UFO sighti ngs takes place, there is simultaneously a marked increase in news coverage of the subject. The degree of news space allotted to \"flying saucers\" appears to be commensurate with the intensity of the wave. The resulting condition, called a \"flap,\" was defined succinctly by the late Edward J. Ruppelt, former head of Project Blue Book, in The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects (Doubleday and Company, 1956, p. l89): \"In Air Force terminology a 'flap' is a condition, or a situation, or a state of being of a group of people characterized by an advanced state of confusion that has not quite yet reached panic proportions.\" The marked confusion, experienced by a very gr eat number of people in the summer of 1947, unquestionably puts the UFO wave of that period into the category of a flap. A \"sighting\" is any obser vation of some unexpl ained aerial phenomenon. A \"report\" is the oral or writ ten record of a sighting. A \"cas e\" refers to a report, plus other elements that are associated with it, such as information about the observer, an account of the investigation, references to the report, or conclusions drawn from the information gathered. For the purposes of br ief reference in this report, each sighting is assigned a Case Number in the Chronology (Section V). In reports of sightings that may be independent observations of the same phenomenon, each independent report has been assigned a separate case number; a nd in reports in which several different sightings are made at different time interv als, or in different locations, but by the same witnesses, each independent sighti ng has a case number. Though this system tends somewhat to increase the statistical records, it does simplif y the procedure of referring to specific sightings.

October 1967 ( xiv )   "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" Section I - Summary of the Period During the summer of 1947 a bizarre and inexplicable situation developed in North America for which, up to the time of the writing of this report, twenty years later, no satisfactory explanat ion has been forthcoming. Begi nning in the latter part of June, people in widely separated places a nd from all walks of life began to report having seen shining, high-speed, strangely ma neuvering objects in the sky. In most of these reports the objects were described as round or disc-shaped. For more than a week sightings were made in continuously increasing numbers. On July 4th the reports rose sharply and spont aneously, and for five days there was scarcely any part of the United States that had not been visited by these strang ely elusive aerial objects. Reports came from many points in Canada as well. The number of sightings crested on July 7th, and during the next fe w days reports began to diminish until, about a week later, only a handful were be ing made from scattered sections of the country. Although the objects themselves had all but vanish ed, interest and speculation about them continued for some time after. A wave of sightings of unidentified flying objects had occurred. Fl ying saucers had become part of the language and the subject of fickle inte rest and ever-incre asing confusion. As most people familiar with the history of the UFO phenomenon are aware, the events of 1947 seemed to begin on June 24th, the date of the sighting made by Kenneth Arnold, while flying a plane over the Cascade Mountains of Washington. The date is partly justified, for it was the report made by this Boise, Idaho pilot and businessman, who sold fire-fighting equi pment throughout the northwest, that opened the first chapter in the modern record of UFO activity. But Arnold's was not the first sighting of the period. For weeks before th at people had been seeing unidentified objects in the sky and keeping the matter to themselves. An important result of Arnold's report was to elicit from thes e earlier witnesses th eir accounts of those previously unreported observations. Reports Before June 1947 As early as the middle of April 1947, at the Weather Bureau in Richmond, Virginia, a U. S. Government meteorol ogist named Walter A. Minczewski and his staff had released a pibal balloon and were tracking its east-to -west course at 15,000 feet when they noticed silver, ellipsoidal object just below it. La rger than the balloon, this object appeared to be flat on botto m, and when observed through the theodolite used to track the balloon, was seen to ha ve a dome on its upper side. Minczewski and his assistants watched the object for fifteen seconds as it travel ed rapidly in level flight on a westerly course, before disapp earing from view. In the official report on file at the Air Force's Project Blue Book, at Wright-Patterson Field, in Dayton, Ohio, this sighting is listed as Unidentified. Another early sighting in th e official files is the report by Byron Savage of Oklahoma City -- like Arnold, a businessman and private pilot. He had seen an object about six weeks before Arnold, on May 17th or 18th, and his report was one of the first to receive widespr ead attention in the newspa pers immediately after Arnold's report had appeared. The Oklahoma City Times gave it prominent space on June"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"26th. At the time of his sighting, Savage had been out in his yard it was dusk, and the sky was still light, when he saw an object “come across the city from just a little east of south ... its altitude was very high somewhere around 10,000 feet, I couldn’t be sure. Funny thing about it, it made no noise . I don't think it had kind of internal combustion engine. But I did notice that right after it went out of sight, I heard the sound of rushing wind and air. I told my wi fe right away, but she thought I must have seen lightning.“ He further described the obj ect as being of “a shiny, silvery color,” and very large -- “bigger than any aircraft we have.” He said it was “perfectly round and flat.” In the Blue Book file he descri bed the object as app earing ellipsoidal in shape as it approached, and completely ci rcular while passing directly overhead, on a course toward the northwest . In this account he said that it appeared “frosty white,” and that its speed was about three times as fast as a jet. It disappeared from view in about fifteen to twenty seconds . Although the sighting details provided by Savage are far more complete than those gi ven for many of the official cases listed by Blue Book as “explained,” this report falls in the category of Insufficient Information. Another case in the Air Force Blue Book files occurred on May 19th, sometime between twelve thirty and one p.m., at Manitou Springs, Colorado. Seven employees of the Pikes Peak Railway, in cluding Navy veteran Dean A. Hauser, mechanics Ted Weigand and Marion Hisshouse, and T. J. Smith and L. D. Jamison, were having lunch when Weigand noticed a bright, silver-colored object approaching rapidly from the northeast. It stopped almo st directly overhead and the group of men watched it perform wild gyrations for a number of minutes. Hauser said that the object, after having approached in a straight line, “began to move erratically in wide circles. All this time it reflected light, like metal, but intermittently, as though the angle of reflection might be cha nging from time to time.” It was difficult to get a clear idea of its shape, and even viewing it through binoculars did not appear to “bring it any closer.” They estimated it s height at one thousand feet. For twenty minutes they watched it climb, dive, reverse its flight course, a nd finally move off into the wind in a westerly direction. “It disappeared in a straight line in the west- northwest in a clear blue sky,” Hauser reported. At no time did anyone hear any noise. An account of the sigh ting appeared in the Denver Post of June 28. The next day the Post reported that the witnesses had been interviewed by representatives of the 15th Air Force headquarters and the resu lts of the investigation would be sent on to Washington. The results, perhaps unknown to the witnesses even to this day, were “possible birds.” ( I – 1 ) Unlisted in the official AF files, but no less interesting than the preceding case, is Dr. Colden R. Battey’s sighting in the last week of May. Dr. Battey, a physician in Augusta, Georgia, had been fi shing ten miles off St. Helena Sound, near Beaufort, South Carolina. At about elev en o’clock that morning he noticed a formation of four disc-like objects flying overhead in a southeasterly direction at a terrific rate of speed. The discs appeared to be spinning on their ax es and were at an estimated altitude of about 20,000 feet. Th ey were silvery and appeared “highly polished,” and on their undersides, Dr. Battey could see a “circular rim, or projection, about one-quarter of the way from the edges.” No sound was heard as they flew overhead. The formation sped out of view in less than twenty seconds. Dr."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Battey’s report of the sighting did not appear in print until July 6th, when the Augusta Chronicle gave it prominent front-page coverage. INS sent it out on the wires, where it was picked up by numerous newspapers around the country. Other May sightings reporte d nearly two months after they had been made include several reports by housewives. Mrs. W. C. Clark, of Memphis, Tennessee, reported in the Commercial-Appeal of July 7th, that she had seen two objects “like tennis balls” fly over her yard around th e first of May; a nd in Newark, New Jersey, Mrs. Rose Slawuta described in the Newark Star-Ledger of the same date how she had seen a “shining elliptical object” with a gold band around it, approaching from the west, on May 10th. The Air For ce files contain a sighting from Milford, Iowa, on May 29th, which is list ed as a “possible meteor.” The Importance of Arnold’s Sighting If Kenneth Arnold, while fl ying on business from Chehalis to Yakima on June 24th, had decided not to assist in the search for a C-46 Marine transport that had crashed on the slopes of Mount Rainier, th e introduction to th e modern period of UFO activity would have been quite differe nt. He chose to make this side-trip, however, and as a consequence he became one of those persons who are in the right place at the right time. Shortly before th ree p.m. he was approaching the mountain from the west side, and as he began a turn of a hundred and eighty degrees toward the south, his eye was caught by a flash, as if “a mirror were reflecting sunlight at me.” Alert for other aircraft, he looked ar ound and saw, to his left and north of Mount Rainier, a chain-like formation of nine brightly scintillating objects rapidly approaching the mountain on a roughly s outhern heading. As they came closer, passing between him and the summit of the mountain, he could see they were nine flat, discoid objects arranged in a diagonally stepped-down, echelon formation, stretched out over a di stance that he later calculated to be five miles. They were evenly spaced but for a wider gap between the fourth and fifth objects. As they crossed the snow-covered summit of Rainier and approached a peak to the south of it, he decided to clock their speed; since they were headed toward Mount Adams, the two mountains would make ex cellent reference points. He began to time them as the first object reappeared from behind the outlier peak on the southwest flank of Mount Rainier. (He later identified this peak as Goat Rocks, but he may be in error as Goat Rocks is approximately halfway between Mount Rainier and Mount Adams.)The objects followed the hogback that stretches to the south, flying erratically and swerving in and out of the lesser peaks \"like the tail of a kite.” He noticed that the objects would flip from si de to side, in unison, flashing brightly as they did so. He also noticed so mething else -- a detail he did not mention in his official report: as the objects flippe d from side to side, they presented their lateral surfaces and Arnold saw that one of the objects appeared to be different from the rest, in the shape of a crescent. He ha dn’t attached much importance to it at first for, as he wrote of it later in The Coming of the Saucers (pp. 22-23), “I thought it was the angle from which I observed this partic ular one which made it look different and I wasn’t completely positive about it.” The objects covered the fifty- mile distance between the two mountains in just one minute and forty-two seconds. Am azed, Arnold began making some rapid"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"calculations as he flew over the area to measure the distance. The results were astonishing: the discs had been flying at a speed of 1,700 miles an hour! To allow for miscalculation he reduced this figure by fi ve hundred but even twelve hundred miles an hour was an amazing speed! When he landed at Yakima an hour later he went straight to Al Baxter, general manager of Central Aircraft, to tell of his experience. The story quickly spread around the airport, and his descripti ons and calculations were disc ussed with great interest by the pilots and mechanics there. And when Arnold later flew on to Pendleton, word of his strange experiences had preceded him, for on his arrival he found a platoon of incredulous newsmen, looking for a good silly -season story. They had only to meet the originator of this preposterous tale, however -- a pilot with more than four thousand hours of flying experience over some of the most mountainous territory in the United States; a reputable salesman of fire-control equipment over a wide area, who did much of his business by air; a deputy sheriff with the Ada County, Idaho, Sheriffs Aerial Posse department and h ear his careful recounting of what had happened, to change their initial skepticism to keen interest. They went over and over his calculations of speed and the figure kept coming out the same. Nothing but rockets went that fast in 1947, and no one knew of any rockets being sent up over Mount Rainier. ( I – 2 ) As a result of his meeti ng with newsmen in Pendleton, Kenneth Arnold's story was filed in a reasonably serious, straightforward manner, and appeared in newspapers all over the country the next da y. In the more than one hundred and fifty newspapers examined for this report, a wire service account appeared in nearly every one, most often as a front-page feature. In the Air Force files the sighting is explained as a \"mirage,\" al though it has often been referred to as an \"unknown.\" Ev en the intelligence officers assigned to investigate the case, Lt. Frank Brown and Captain William Davidson, of Hamilton Field, California, were impressed with Arnold's sighting, for their report, in part, says: \"It is the personal opinion of th e interviewer that Mr. Arnold actually saw what he stated he saw. It is difficult to believe that a man of [his] character and apparent integrity would stat e that he saw objects and write up a report to the extent that he did if he did not see them.\" Dr. J. Allen Hynek, scientific consultant of the Air Forces investigation of UFOs, was said to have found \"inconsisten cies\" in Arnold's report when reviewing the case for Project Sign in late 1948 or early 1949. According to the Project \"Saucer\" Press Summary, released in Apr il 1949, the problem la y in reconciling Arnold's estimate of speed and distance with his estimate of the objects size. Edward J. Ruppelt, in his book, The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects , describes this question of estimates in more detail (p. 33). Arnold reporte d that the objects had been seen at an estimated distance of twenty to twenty-five miles, and estimated their size to be about \"two-thirds the size of a DC-4,\" or from forty-five to fifty feet in length. The objection raised was that an obj ect that size cannot be resolved by the human eye at that distance; therefore, Arnol d's estimate of distance was said to be in"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"error, the objects having been m uch c loser and traveling at subsonic speeds well within the range of nor mal aircraft. This argum ent ignored the fact that Arnold had estab lished the distance with fixed reference points, and th at it was his estim ate of size that m ust have been in e rror, the discs probably being a great d eal larger th an he guessed. In view of Dr. Hynek’s opinion that the objects were probably som e kind of conventional aircraft, it is curious that the ca se is listed as a “m irage” rather than as “possible aircraft.” W ithin just days of the pub lication of Arnold' s report, other accounts began to appear. At least twenty people from mo re than a dozen widely separated places reported that they, too, had seen sim ilar obj ects. Som e of these si ghtings had occurred before June 24th, som e had been m ade on th e sam e day as Arnold' s, and a few were made on the days following. Most of the reports cam e from the northwest. The floodgates were now open for the rush of repor ts that were soon to follow. But it had taken a m an of Kenneth Arnold’s character a nd f orthright conviction to open them by making public his own report. If it had not been for Arnold, which witness, and which report, m ight have been the first? It is not possible to single out any of the early witnesses, or cases, for not enough infor mation about them is available. O ne point is certain, how ever: it is dif ficult to im agine th at the sightings of st range aerial objects would have rem ained \"hidden\" m uch after June 25th. ( I – 3 ) Other Reports, June 1 - 24 At least two-dozen sightings were reported to have been m ade before June 24th. As far as can be determ ined, none of th em appeared in newspapers before that date. There are six reports in the Air Force files f or th e period June 1-23. One of these, a foreign report describing objects seen over Budapest on June 10, is not included in this report. T he first official case for June describes an air-to-air like observation by pilot Forrest W enyon on June 2nd, near Lewes, Delaware (AF files have his nam e as Horace P. W enyon). W enyon reported seeing an object shaped a m ayonnaise jar as it flew across the nose of his plane (see S ection III, p. 9, for"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"details). Another pilot's report was made by stunt pilot Richard Rankin, who saw two flights of a group of objects at Bakersfield, California, on June 23r Air Force lists the date of this si ghting as June 14t h, although the press accounts, published on July 1st, give it as June 23rd.) None of th e official sightings for this period are classified as “unknowns.” Of twenty-nine sightings occurring between June 1st and June 23rd two-thirds were made in the west, and nine in the northeast; about half the sightings were of a single object, while the rest describe two or more objects. Thirte reports involved a single witness. d (see II-3). (The , nearly en of these On June 24th, the day that Ar nold saw his formation of nine discs, there was a f r the f d sharp increase in the number of UFO si ghtings, from six on the previous day, to twenty. Of these reports, all but two occurr ed in the Pacific Northwest. Over half these reports appeared in th e papers within several days of Arnold's account and one (Case 40) may be a ground confir mation of his sighting, although the reported directions are at odds with Arnold's. Most of the June 24th sightings are daylight reports; five occurred at night. About half of the reports are, like Arnold's, o multiple objects. The Air Force files list th ree sightings for that day: besides the Arnold report, one describes objects seen in the Oregon Cascades by a prospector, who noted electromagnetic effects on his compass while the objects were overhead (see IV-3); it is considered unide ntified by the Air Force. The other, by the Lt. Governor of Idaho, was made in Bo ise, Idaho, and is considered to be \"astronomical,\" although the si ghting was made at three th irty in the afternoon (see III-16). Published records have referr ed to a total of forty-nine UFO reports fo period June 1st through June 24th, by more than seventy-five witne sses, two thirds o whom have been fully identified. These figur es raise an interes ting question: why di none of these seventy-five witnesses re port their unusual observations until after Arnolds story had been published? In a numbe r of those reports, the witnesses tried to account for their initial silence. Richard L. Bitters, editor of the Wapakoneta (Ohio) Daily News , reportedly felt that his sighting of June 23rd was simply not a news story, and did not publish it until two weeks later when he changed his mind at the -6); on the same night , two other Ohio residents made a similar sighting but delayed reporting it \"until others had told of seeing them\" (Case 28); E. the ed is height of the wave (III B. Parks, of Hazel Green, Alabama, felt that the phenomenon he observed about same time was \"so unusual that it was not reported for fear others would disbelieve the account of it\" (Case 29). Richar d Rankin, who had not attached any \"otherworldly\" significance to his sighting of June 23rd (or 14th) at Bakersfield, California, assumed that he was obser ving the Navy’s experimental \"Flying Flapjack,\" the XF5U-1, even though \"I couldn’t make out the number or location of the propellers, and I couldn’t di stinguish any wings or tail\" (II-3) so he hesitated to describe what he had seen \"until others were reporting the same thing.\" And so it went: if the reason for not reporting these earl ier sightings at the time they occurr not exactly stated in every case, it is at least implicitly apparent the witnesses were afraid to report them because they were so unusual. The Element of Fear"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" The 1947 UFO wave is perhaps the most fascinating of any to examine because of its unique position at the very beginning of the contemporary period of UFO activity in this country. There were no \"attitudes\" about UFOs in June 1947. There were no preconceptions, no misconc eptions, no \"policies\" by either press or public, or by any official agencies, and certainly no pattern ex isted concer phenomenon by which comparisons might be made. Few people recalled t of \"ghost rockets\" over Sw eden during the summer of 1946, and it was only during the crest of the 1947 wave, on July 6th and 7th, that any connection was made w those earlier phenomena. A few World War II veterans, who had observed \"foo fighters\" over Germany and in the South Pacific during the war, w of those earlier incidents by the widespread reports of flying saucers. But for most witnesses, the experience of observing st range aerial manifestations was completely without precedent and profoundly baffling. We now know that after 194 7 it could be expected that a UFO witness might be afraid to report a sighti ng publicly for fea ning the he reports ith ere now reminded r of ensui ng ridicule and intimidation. This is a reaction we have come to expect, one of the many psychological complexities of the UFO phenomenon veloped out of prevailing public and official attitudes over a long period of time. But in 1947 there were no such precedents to create this type of f ear; these witnesses had seen something unaccountable and their fear was of the unknown, a reaction to something totally new and unexpected. There was no place, outside of science fiction, for this kind of inexplicable experience: the appearan ce of some new phenomenon was not just frightening, it was against all comm on sense, and if something in someone’s experience does not make any sense, it is not likely that this experience is going to be made public, at least not until it is discovered that others have shared the same baffling experience. And so to many, it must have come as something of a relief to read of Kenneth Arnold's sighting, and to discover that they had not taken leave of their senses and were not the only ones to have come face to face with something they were quite unable to explain or understand. ( I – 4 ) that ha s de"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" Sightings After June 24th Arnold's report appeared in the afternoon and evening papers in the northwest on June 25th. On the 26th, morning papers were already carrying new reports. The first two to appear were those of Byron Sava ge, in Oklahoma City (see I-1), and W. I Davenport, in Kansas City (see . II-1). Sava ge, a businessman and private pilot, like Arnold, must have felt a special bond with th e Boise observer, for he is quoted as ing they eed. So soon did Savage and Da venport file their reports that these two cases appeared simultaneously with Arnold's on the morning of June 26th as front-page, saying, \"I know that boy up th ere really saw them.\" The Davenport sighting had occurred on June 25th and he, like Arnold, reported having seen nine objects, but with some major dissimilarities: the objects traveled in a loose formation, made noise, and left vapor trails . The only th had in common with Arnold’s objects wa s their number, and their great sp banner-headline stories in the Portland Oregon Journal . Later that same day, other reports began to appear. There are thirteen reported sightings on record for June 25th, five of which were reported by the end of June. (Several of these cases are of uncertain dates, based on the newspaper data that were availabl e.) Most of the sightings took place in in ix hicago, the idly she was unable to make an accurate count of them (Case 64). The sightings of June 26th involved a tota l of thirteen witnesses, eleven of whom western states, but New York, Pennsylvani a, Illinois and Missouri also are also represented. Three of these sightings occu rred after dark. Six are multiple object reports, four of which described two UFOs. At least nineteen pe ople were involved the reports, most of whom were identified. On the following day, June 26th, the number of sighting dropped to eight, s of them, from the Utah-Arizona area, and one each in Oklahoma and Illinois. All were daylight observations except the one in Illinois, which is the only multiple- object report in the group. In th is report, the witne ss, Mrs. J. M. Harrison, of C described watching a large fireball pass ove r at two a.m.; as it moved toward northwest it diminished in size and broke up into two dozen small discs which whirled around so rap were identified by name. On June 27th, the number of sightings rose again to at least nineteen. (Several other sightings reported in the Montreal Star a few weeks later may have been confirmations of the fireball meteor reco rded by the American Meteor Society and described in Popular Astronomy , January, 1948, pp. 39-40; it was reported seen at 8:56 P.M. EST over upper New York state, moving roughly from the area near Albany toward Watertown, according to the astronomer, Dr. Charles P. Olivier.) Eight of the June 27th reports we re from New Mexico, and three came from Washington state; one of the latter, from a town near the Columbia River called Woodland, was a most unusual and well-re ported multiple-object sighting (see II- 2). Three reports were made in Texas, but two of these, in El Paso, lack even the barest of details, including definite dates. Two reports were made in Arizona and one"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"each came from Arkansas, British Columbia, and Vermont. (The Vermont report, Case 86, might also be a confirmation of the New York meteor reports.) Four of these nineteen sightings occurred at night , although the two El Paso reports are uncertain; the remainder of th e sightings were made by day. For June 28th through th e 30th, sightings averag ed about a dozen per day; thirteen for June 28th (including two of uncertain da te), twelve for June 29th and fourteen for June 30th. The low percenta ge of after-dark reports remained about the same as earlier during these three da ys: thirty daylight sightings, seven after dark, and two uncertain. Over half of thes e reports came from the west. Other came from Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa, Wi sconsin, Ohio, Michigan, Ontario, New , reports Hampshire, South Carolina, Alabama, and Tennessee. Fifteen were multiple object s, -air d Canyon by a Navy pi lot of two objects plummeting to earth on June 30th (II-12). Few of the thirty-nine reports for this period received headline quite reports, and of a total of nearly eighty witnesses involved duri ng these three day about sixty of them were identified in news accounts. The Air Force files include seven reports from the period of June 28th through the 30th, none of them being classified as unidentified. Among the more interesting of these cases is a sighting by Carl J. Zohn, a Naval Research Laboratory missile expert, made at White Sands, New Mexico on June 29th (see III-18) , and an air-to sighting made near Gran attention when they were printed, and by J une 30th newspaper coverage was not as widespread as it had been several da ys earlier. But UFO sightings would very shortly pick again as the Ju ly 4th holiday approached. Explaining the Inexplicable It can be expected th at when people are confronted with some novel will try to account for it in some rational way. The more bizarre the experience, however, the less rational the explanations become. Flying saucers were about a experience, they s bizarre an experience as one could imagine, so it is therefore not surprising to find that by the end of June, opinions a nd \"explanations,\" as well as flying saucer reports, were on the increase. The San Francisco Chronicle for June 27 printed a roundup of opinion regarding Arnold's sighting from assorted \"experts.\" Captain Al Smith, a United A Lines pilot, believed that what Arnold had s een were \"reflections of his instrument panel,\" presumably in the Pl exiglas canopy of his plane, although this is not stated. Elmer Fisher, Portland, Oregon meteorol ogist, suggested that Arnold had encountered \"a slight touch of snow blindness from the mountain peaks.\" ( I – 5 ) Dr. J. Hugh Pruett, Univer sity of Oregon astronomer and meteorologist, said that \"persistent vision,\" often experienced after looking at object s such as the sun, \"could h ir ave kept such reflec tions before him as they passed.\" Getting back on safer ground, Dr. Pruett added that th e objects \"were not of meteor ic origin, for meteors do not dip and sway.\""},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" In his syndicated column on the same day, AP Science Writer Howard Blakeslee also tackled the Arnold report, stati ng that \"in clear air th e flash of sunlig from a plane can easily be seen for fifty m iles. This flash is round, the shape of the sun. Any other reflection at a great distance is also likel y to be round, coming from a small area on the plane.\" He a W. ht lso grappled with the problem of the high speeds: if these objects had been jet planes, \"their speeds probably would be noticeable and could fit into the estimates, where sigh impression of something traveling at 1,000 miles an hour.\" He secured his grasp on this assessment by explaining that the eye rarely makes an accurate estimate of speed through the sky. To be fair to Blakeslee, perhaps he did not know th at Arnold had established the distance between him and the objects based on familiar landmarks; on the other hand, perhaps he chose to ignore it. Another \"explanation\" was of fered on the same day by Lt. Colonel Harold R Turner, at White Sands, New Mexico. In an AP account carried in many papers, Turner maintained, like Blakeslee, that Ar nold had seen jet planes. \"The White Sand Proving Ground commandant said th at jet planes have circul ar exhaust pipes and that these, when heated, might give an illusion of discs.\" He, too, may have been ignoran of the facts: for example, that Arnold saw the objects firs t as they were approaching, north of Mount Rainier, in which position th eir \"circular jet exhausts\" would not hav been visible. On the next day, following a series of reports from New Mexico, Colonel Turner rejected jet exhausts in fa vor of \"meteorites,\" explaining that \"they appear much larger and apparently are co ming closer to earth than usual\" (see III- 9). It is perfectly clear that Colonel Turn er did not know what a meteorite was, let alone flying saucers. But someone who did know the difference between meteors and meteorites made a statement that was printed in the Denver Post t gave the . s t e of June 28. Dr. H. H. Nining an expert in the field of meteoritics, d eclared that the object observed by Byron Savage may have been a meteor; and in commenting on another New Mexico sighting of the previous day, this one reporte d near Shiprock by an associate, Dr. R. L. Hopkins (Case 81), Nininger said he be lieved that what Dr. Hopkins saw \"could have been a meteorite falling somewhere in southeast Arizona.\" Dr. Hopkins, of Maitland, Florida, had been visiting Nininger at his laboratory in Winslow and had en near Shiprock, New Mexico, when th e sighting was made. Regarding the objects id that those could not have been meteors; the descriptions of them sounde d to him more like \"mechanical objects.\" Some explanations were as bizarre as the UFO reports themselves. One of the most original and imaginative explanations came the same day (June 28th) from the operator of a bottle-capping plant in Everett, Washington, and was carried widely by the wire services. Offere d with apparent seriousness, this solution proposed that the little aluminum discs in side the bottle caps were set free when the bottle caps were melted down, rose up the chim neys on columns of hot air, and were then carried aloft by the winds to be reported as flyi ng discs by numerous people throughout the country. On June 30th another Army official spoke out. AP reported that Colonel Alfred F. Kilberer, intelligence officer of the Eighth Air Force, in commenting upon recent reports made in Texas, said bluntly that \"the reports might be true, but I doubt er , be Arnold had seen, however, Dr. Nininger sa"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"it. \" Two days later he, like his colleagues in White Sands, had further thoughts on the subject: in the Houston Post , AP quoted him as saying fl ying saucer reports were y in human psychology.\" nothing more than \"an interesting stud June Roundup By June 30 th sightings for that month had been made in at least thirty states and in two Canadian provinces.

Daylight sightings predominated, totaling ninety; night sightings came to twenty- eight and ten were of undetermined time s. Most people had reported seeing “round objects” or “discs;” some described the obj ects as “oval.” Witnesses numbered more than 220 persons, representing a wide cross-section of professions, including pilots, scientists, police, public officials, physicians, teachers, students, forest rangers, newspaper men, railroad engineers, military men, housewives, a barber, a dentist, and a postmaster.

The vantage point of time allo ws us to view past events with an objec that was impossible as those events were taking place. Looking back today on the UFO sightings of June, 1947, it appears to be unmistakably evident that by the the month there was already enough evid ence to justify a thorough scientific investigation into th ese unexplained appearances. It is understandable that such an idea occurred to scarcely anyone in mid-1947.

There are no reports in the Air Force files for July 1st and 2nd. Almost two hundred witnesses, nearly as many as for the entire month of June, were involved in these sightings half of them in one sighting alone: over a hundred spectators at an amateur ball gam in Cincinnati saw two of the discs move sl owly over the field on the evening of 2nd (Case 161).

It is considered unidentified by the Air Force. Another interesting report describes the landing, seen by a family of ten in Northern Idaho, of eight huge objects (II-12). This report should have been among those in th e Air Force files because it had be reported to intelligence officers from the Spokane Army Air Base, and an intensive air search was carried out by two missions of the National Guards 116th Fighter Group. Local sheriffs deputies also made a ground search, but since no apparent t of the objects was found, a report was Of the July 3rd sightings, twenty were made by daylight, ten by night, and for three the time is uncertain. There were fourteen multiple object reports, six of which describe formations of three objects. At l east sixty-five witne sses were inv which fifty were identified by name. During the five weeks from June 1st through July 3rd, sightings had been made in at least thirty-six states and th ree Canadian provinces; yet a UP story from Chicago, date-lined July 3rd and found in many morning papers for July 4th, headlined a rundown of reports, “Flying Saucers Seen Over 8 States.” An AP account sightings had been made in ten states.

On the following day, July 4th, official statements were forthcoming fro Wright Field, where reports were bei ng received and examined, and from elsewhere.

Within twenty four hours afte r the release of these offi cial statements events would begin to take place that would leave everybody civilians and military personnel alike in a state closely approximating Ruppe lt’s description of a flap. Reports of sightings, coming almost simultaneously from hundreds of bewildered citizens, were made to newspapers and police stations all over the country, and adjacent areas as well, from Southern California to New Brunswick, and from Louisiana to North Dakota. People everywhere were experien cing the beginning of one of the most massive waves of UFO sightings on reco rd. Reports came from all kinds of observers: from picnickers and holiday crow ds, from policemen and public officials, and from pilots, farmers, professional men, housewives and bus drivers. ( I – 7 ) At Twin Falls, Idaho, sixty pi cnickers watched three formations of more than thirty-five objects flying ove rhead (II-5); and later in the evening, at Hauser Lake, near Spokane, more than two hundred persons saw a lone disc in the sky overhead (II- 6); the entire crew of a United Airline fli ght watched two groups of discs near the Idaho-Oregon border at dusk (III-10); dozens of police and scores of citizens reported"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"seeing numerous discs flying over Portland, Or egon, early in the af ternoon (III-15); air-to-air sightings were ma de by two private pilots, one in Idaho and the other in California (III-10); in Seattle, a Coast- guardsman took the first widely-publicized photograph of a flying disc overhead (IV-3); in Boise a UP newsman and friends watched a single disc fly directly overh ead at a tremendous speed and disappear over the horizon in a matter of seconds (III-6). But reports were not confined to the west: in New Orleans, a salesgirl saw a speeding disc fly over Lake Pontchartrain (Case 223); a group of people in Port Huron, Michigan, counted an assortment of almost twenty discs flying in various directions after dark (Cas e 276); a blazing ball of fire was seen hovering near the home of an Alexandria, Virginia woman early in the morning of the 4th (II-6); and a physician at the Pennsylvania Hospital for Mental Diseases saw an object with whirling jets, or wings, similar to an obj ect reported seen seve ral hours earlier by a Saint Louis mechanic and his family (II- 14); and in Fayetteville, Arkansas, a farmer's livestock bolted when objects swooped overhead (IV-1). Sightings continued into the evening hours with numerous after-dark reports of fast-moving lights and illuminated discs coming from many areas. The total number of reports through midnight on July 4th was more than double the number for the previous day. References to no less th an eighty-eight specif ic sightings were found, spread over an area comprising twenty-four states and one Canadian province. Well over four hundred people fr om all walks of life witnessed the phenomena. Approximately two- thirds of all these observa tions took place within the daylight hours or dusk, and almost all of the daylight reports described discs, or al objects; included with the night reports were several accounts of reballs. More than half of the sightings described a single obj ect; the rest involved ore, with some groups flying in V- formations.

A number of slow-moving and hovering objects were also described. The effect of all these celestial displa ys was extraordinary. The next day, Ju 5th, newspapers all over the country gave front-page, banner-headline coverage to th sightings. Local papers featured reports of sightings coming from nearby areas, but the wire services carried more than thirty specific sightings from various locations. The Portland, Oregon reports and the United Air Lines sighting was by far the most publicized, given in a detailed a nd straightforward manner. As the Portland (\"Er -- Quack, Quack\") Oregonian remarked of the UAL case: \"Their report, detailed enough to shake the most incredulous, left them (the observers) equally shaken.\" The photograph taken near Seattle by Coast-guard sman Frank Ryman was also given \"t billing\" in many newspapers as graphic eviden ce of the reality of the reported ob Sightings on July 5th c ontinued at a high rate, although the references examined turned up eleven fewer sightings than on the previous day for a total of seventy-seven specific observations.

Clark, commanding officer of the Ha nford Engineering Works of the Ato Energy Project in Richland, Washington, who said he knew of no connection betwee atomic energy experiments at Hanford and \"flying saucers.\" Another \"authority\" on secret government devices was national commander- in-chief of the Veterans of Foreign Wars , Louis E. Starr, of Portland, Oregon. AP reports that in Columbus on July 5th, in a speech to Ohio VFW members, Starr stated that he was \"momentarily expecting word fr om Washington\" concer ning the \"fleets of flying saucers,\" which would \"help explain the discs.\" A telegram containing the information, said Starr, \"was due here at thr ee p.m. (EST)\" and he promised to read it to his listeners.

His decision to remain anonymous was most judicious. The Portland Oregonian (\"Er -- Quack, Quack\") of July 6th quoted several professi onal men and their various professi onal theories. Dr. Frederick A.

Significantly, not one of their utterances indicated even the slightest degree of scientific curiosity about wh at this new phenomenon being seen in the sky might be. UFO reports were summarily dismi ssed by most of these scientists. At a convention for astronomers held at the Franklin In stitute in Philadelphia, diligent newsman polled the \"experts\" for their opinions. Dr. Harlow Shapley, director of Harvard College Observatory, said that unless he saw a disc himself, he had absolutely nothing to say. Dr. Charles P. Olivier, president of the American Meteor Society, (who later became a NICAP Board Member), told reporters that none of the astronomical observers with whom he was in touch around the country had seen anything resembling such objects, and a dded that while reports did not appear to resemble meteors, sightings might be expect ed to increase toward the end of Ju when the Delta Aquarids made their annual appearance. Dr. Roy Marshall, of the Fels Planetarium in Philadelphia, wrote off all re ports as \"plain hysteria;\" unless he saw one himself, he commented, he wouldn’t comment. In Chicago, two of the count ry’s leading astronomers ag reed that the reported discs \"couldn’t be meteors.\" Dr. Gerard Kuip er, head of the University of Chicago’s Yerkes Observatory at Williams Bay, Wisconsi n, agreed with Dr. Oliver Lee, head of Northwestern University’s Dearborn Observatory at Evanston, when the latter proposed that the objects were \"man-made\" and probably \"radio-controlled.\" Lee said that \"the Army, Navy and Air Force are work ing secretly on all sorts of things.\" He exhorted inquisitive newsmen to \"remembe r the A-bomb, and radar signals to the moon.\" ( I – 9 ) Judging from statements such as these, the \"spirit of sc ientific inquiry\" had no relevance when it came to UFOs, as far as the scientific fraternity itself was concerned.

The Triumph of Ridicule By the time the sightings for July 6th and 7th had been published, the newspapers were no longer presenting th the detail and responsibility that had been given to the reports of July 4t h and 5th. Skepticism, and in many cases utright ridicule, dominated news coverage of UFO sightings and those who reported them. A general attitude of \"everybo dy’s-doing-it-now\" gave many news accounts more than a faint air of suspicion. Some of the news repor ts were entirely misleading and details were manufactured for the sake of creating a more sensational story. For example, a perfectly \"ordinary\" UFO sighting made in Denver was sent out over the UP wires as follows: \"George Kuger of Denver said he sa w a flying disc with an American flag on it.\" There is nothing in the local account of Kuger’s report that mentions flags, American or otherwise, but in hundreds of newspapers across the country, Kuger was made out a fool by the flagrant irrespons ibility of the pres s (Case 427). Another example of its use of ridicule to not on ly debunk a report but make the reporter look foolish occurred in the wire accounts describing a Chica go woman who, on July 6th, reported that she had seen a \"flying saucer with legs.\" By playing up the woman’s unfortunate expression, \"I t hought for sure it was coming down and slap me in the face,\" when in fact she had probably been scared out of her wits, the papers succeeded in turning the report into some thing patently ridiculous. Had newsmen been more responsible, they would have known that just the day before, several Covington, Kentucky, women had also reporte d seeing an object with legs (II- 15); and we now know that since 1947 there have been numerous reports of objects the fact s wi o"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"with sim ilar appendages. In still another cas e, the wom an in Palm dale, California, who described the satellite object case as appearing like \"a mam a hen with her baby chicks,\" gave newsm en a real heyday of m erriment; and yet this is probably one of the m ost significant reports to com e out of the entire 1947 wave (Cases 528 & 530). These are only isolated exam ples of the way in which the press resorted to ridicule because it had prejudged the valu e of a news story and no longer felt it was necessary or sufficient merely to report the facts responsibly. News coverage during the crest of the wave descended to regr ettably low standard s and established a modus operandi regarding UFO coverage that has char acterized its handling of the subject ever since. It is one of the chief reasons w hy, twenty years later, it is a subject that rem ains damned to ridicule: the taint had been acquired at the very outset.

In Syracuse, New York, Dr. H. A.

But we don’t believe anyone in this country, or outside of this country, has developed a guided missile that will go 1,200 miles an hour, as some reports have indicated.\" Other governme nt spokesmen repeated this disclaimer: \"No such phenomenon can be explained by any experiments being conducted by the Army Air Forces,\" another Army spokesman reported on July 7th, and Rear Admiral Paul F. Lee, director of the Naval Research La boratory, concurred. In a statement from ashington carried by UP on July 8th, an uni dentified spokesman said the Army was certain of what the saucers were not ds e Vete W : they were not secret bacteriological devices of some foreign power; they were not (again) secret Army rockets; and they w ere not space ships.

One of these objects had spewed out tons of metallic fragments some of which had damaged his boat and injured his son.

They examined the object through binoculars and said that through the glasses the object appeared to be V-shaped. It was flying in a straight, level course, but seemed to be \"dipping a bit\" as it flew along, and flashing in the sun, according to the witnesses.

One of the discs, she said, was much larger than the rest and she estimated its size to be at least \"a mile in diameter.\" She did not mention the sighting until a week later because she said she felt \"a little silly about it. Now I think that if they are dangerous, everybody should know about them.\" Case 454 -- July 6, Tucson, Arizona: The first in a series of satellite object sightings that occurred in a little more than 24 hours, and moved progressively around the perimeter of the continental United States in a clockwise pattern, took place at Tucson at 5:00 p.m. MST. Three disc-shaped objects -- one larger than the other two -- were seen by a retired lawyer, Joseph Hendron, and his wife as they sat outside their home at 521 North Warren Avenue. \"At about five p.m., my wife and I were sitting on the patio watching the cloud formations. I suddenly saw what firs t appeared to be a kite,\" the lawyer reported. \"We then saw two more. They were coming from the east, in the direction of Davis Monthan Field, and went north. They appeared very high, and two appeared smaller than the other.

Walter Laos (Case 453) had b een sitting in his backyard at 723 East 1st Street at 4:30 p.m. when he saw a group of from four to six round objects to the northeast, over the Catalina Mountains. (The ne ws account in the Tucson Arizona Daily Citizen reports the number of objects as two.) Laos told McDonald that the objects seemed to be flying near what looked like an ordina ry cloud. They were moving northeast at a very high speed and at one point made a sudden descent toward the ground and swooped back up, disappearing aloft. ( II – 18 ) They were dark in color, he told McDonald, but must have been shiny because they occasionally glinted. He called his family out, but by the time they got there the objects had disappeared. They had been in view for no more than 15 seconds. The news account quoted Laos as having estimated the objects' height at 5,000 to 6,000 et, their speed at 200 miles an hour, and thei r size at about five to six feet. In that count he described their color as white aluminum. The account confirms their northeasterly heading, as described to Although the direction is the same as that described by the Hendrons, th objects and exact time differ, so it cannot be said with certai nty that the two reports we re of the same phenomenon. fe ac McD onald. e numbe r of Case 528 -- July 6, near Palmdale, California: Mrs. Amy Herdliska, housewife living Four Points in the Palmdale area, re ported that she had seen a group of objects twice during the late evening behaving in Sgt.

Case 556 -- July 7, Tacoma, Washington: A litt le more than three hours after Mrs. Herdliska had seen the second flight of ma ma and baby discs, a similar sighting was made by two Tacoma policemen.

Johnson said that although it was impossible to judge altitude, size, speed or distance accuratel y, the large disc appeared to move at tremendous speed and was the apparent \"size of a softball.\" One of the smaller discs was seen flying over South Tacoma; later, another was seen to the west, over Hood Canal; a third, which flew out of sight in less than a minute, appeared over Commencement Bay. At one point, the larg e object made a rapid ascent of an estimated 5,000 feet above its former altitude at extremely high speed, \"quicker than you could snap your fingers,\" according to Davies. He said that the parent disc \"seemed a shade of red part of the time, particularly when it zoomed upward, but and Stan Johnson were parked at North 33r d and Adams Streets with their hea and motor turned off. Davies' attention wa s caught by a \"streak\" in the sky; looking more closely, he saw a strange spectacle. \"I didn't say anything,\" he reported later. \"Then I noticed Stan was watching it too.\" \"Do you see anything?\" Johnson asked. \"Yeah, do you?\" Davies answered cautiously. \"I thought I was crazy,\" Johnson remarked with relief. \"I've been watching it for five minutes.\" \"So have I,\" his partner admitted. The cause for this guarded exchange was the sight of a group of six or seve disc-like objects seen just below a bri ght moon in the southern sky. One central object, larger than the others, seemed to act as a sort of \"flagship.\" The smaller objects would make repeated movements toward the large disc and then glide away to the south. The officers said the larger disc appeared to be \"s pinning like a top, and throwing off sparks like a bursting The officers estimated that th e objects were at an altitude of about 10,000 feet. The smaller \"and more distinct objects\" began to move westward in a loose group, and vanished from view, while the large disc remained for a brief time in one spot, and then it too began to move westward.

In all, they had observed the phenom enon for a half an hour. At the police station, officers said an unnamed caller from South Tacoma ha d phoned in exactly at the same time to report seeing the same spectacle, and M. C. Streans, of 913 South L, reported he had watched the same phenomenon sometime after 2:00 a.m. Dr. McDonald interviewed Ev an Davies, who is still with the Tacoma police force, on two consecutive days by phone. Davies recalled that the night of the sighting was very clear. He and Stan Johnson were parked in Car D-3 near the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, facing west, when they first saw the objects. Davies compared the motion of the smaller ones to \"s parks that shot out away from the main object but then would come back to it\" like a \"sparkler, except fo r their reentry.\" He put their altitude roughly at 10,000 feet. avies told McDonald that the most striking feature of the entire sighting was the way the objects would suddenly jump from one location to another spot \"miles nce.

In a small percentage of re ports, however, evidence exists or was reported of something more than just a sensory impression of an aerial phenomenon. Such evidence includes reactions by animals to the presence of a UFO; electrical a electromagnetic effects occurring when UFOs were seen; deposits and traces, including fragments left by low-hoveri ng or landing objec ts; and records on they do features and circumstances beyond me re visual observation, are fragment nevertheless, they provide clues to th e character of the phenomena and offer supporting evidence of their actual existen ce. A few such cases (except for rad reports) occurred during the 1947 UFO wave. Animal Reactions Case 231 -- July 4, Portland, Oregon: Patrolma n McDowell's report of the pigeons reacting to five discs overhead (see III-15). Cases 263 and 350 -- July 4 & 5, Fayetteville, Arkansas: Henry Seay, a farmer livi two miles north ng of Fayetteville, reported th at on two consecutive nights, just before dark, his livestock bolted when uniden tified flying objects swooped overhead. On July 4, iscs \"about the size of pancakes, and whirling around at the same time,\" flying from 500 to 1,000 ed st they Dr. McDonald was able to interview Seay by phone a nd clarified a number of points in the news accounts. He discussed the sighting on the evening of the 5th with Seay, since it seems to have involved a br ief touch-down landing; the events of the preceding night were not covered, as the witness, now quite elderly, was quite reluctant to discuss it at all. Seay told McDonald that he had been driving his ca ttle along his road near sunset on the 5th when he noticed a single object pass overhead. He became aware of its presence when something like dust fe ll on him. His arms were bare and although he felt the dust falling on his skin, it di d not burn. The object appeared to be ten or twelve feet across and \"the whole thing gl owed.\" The cattle bolted as Seay looked up and saw the object. The cows, in front of hi m, all ran off to the other side of the pasture and it took him more than ten mi nutes to get them all rounded up. He had been driving them up to the barn for evening milking. Seay said, as he was rounding up cat tle and horses, three yellow d feet overhead, frightened the animals. The objects were reported as flying in a southwesterly path. The following evening the same thing took place. The wire service accounts are not clear about details, but they report that a disc came down to about 300 feet and \"dropped sparks, which were like dust on me,\" according to Seay. He said he believ the object had come down near his home, but that it was \"nothing but ashes and du when it hit.\" He commented briefly that \"t he animals sure do get up and go when see those things.\""},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":" The object moved across th e pasture and came down in front of him, on the south side of his barn, as he recalled. It only touched down momentarily, perhaps for a few seconds, at a distance of about 200 yard s from him. He stated that he saw it on or close to the ground with the barn behind it. It had been moving to the northeast. The shape of the object was round and flattened. He heard no noise at any time. After several seconds, the object rose up vertically about 30 or 40 feet and then shot off horizontally at a speed estimated as 50 miles an hour. It left a shower of yellow sparks as it took off. It flew over a field of oats, but did not damage the oats, although the sparks were seen falling to the ground. The light emitted by the obj ect was not blinding, but he could not see the shape very well. Dr. McDonald asked him if there had been any other reports from the area at the same time and Seay said th ere were others two or three miles away who saw it and described it similarly. He ha d talked to some of them but did not know their names, except for one man who came over to cut his oats several days later, and who had seen it. The man is now dead, but Seay would not give his name. He added that he had found no marks in th e barnyard where the object had appeared to set down.

Fragments, Ashes, and Traces Case 19 -- June 21, near Titusville, Pennsylvani a: Mill-worker Donald Bunce, of Troy Center, was driving to work at his plan t in Titusville at an unspecified time day when, he later reported, he saw an object \"streaking through the sky,\" He said it of e s w hit the ground in a field near by and he hurried to the spot where it came to earth. Th object, glowing white and hot, was half-burie d in the ground. Using a shovel that wa in his car, Bunce scooped the object up, brought it to work and showed it to his fello workers at the mill. He took it home after wo rk and forgot about it, until reports of flying objects renewed his interest in having the object identified. ( IV – 1 ) The object was described as being about five inches long, was oval in shape, was lightweight, and resembled a piece of coral. On July 8 Bunce took it to Allegheny College, at Meadville. At Allegheny, Chemistry Professor H. R. Rhinesmith \"admitted he had never seen anything like it,\" although no tests of the fragment appear to have been made.

Another friend, Joe Gerrick, of Hillsboro, also examined it and said that one of the remaining pieces \"looked lik e tinfoil,\" but when they picked it up \"it appeared to be celluloid.\" Whatever it was, most of it seemed to \"have melted,\" subliming into a gelatinous residue. Th e men contacted Hillsboro newsman Dan Shults, who also viewed the remains. \"It was a dusty, silvery s ubstance,\" he reported \"I picked up some of the pieces and it wa sn't like anything I'd ever seen before.\" Unfortunately, it seems that none of the mate rial was given to a ppropriate authoriti for analysis. Case 685 -- July 7, Omaha, Nebraska: Fred R. Reibold, of 2315 Himebaugh Avenue, and his motherin-law, Mrs. Gertrude Sniffen, reported that at 10:30 p.m. CST they had seen \"a flaming object\" drop into the stre et in front of their home. The object round, disc-shaped, and about th e size of a silver dollar, and it lay in the stree was t \"burning with extreme heat.\" Newspapers were called and newsmen sent out to investigate. Before they arrived, however, an intrepid neighborhood boy kicked at the fragment, after the fire had subsided, a nd it \"fell to pieces.\" When the reporters arrived, they scooped up the remaining ashe s and took them away for analysis. The pavement was scorched where the object had lain. The Omaha World-Herald reported the next day th at chemical analysis, under n explained as \"tobacco ashes.\" Dr. C. L. Kenny, head of the Chemistry Department of the College of Dentistry, Creighton University, and carried out by two uni dentified students, re vealed traces of sodium, potassium, iron, aluminum, carbonate, sulphate, and unburnt carbon. According to Dr. Kenny, it was nothing more than \"ordinary pipe tobacco.\" The report is included among those in the Air Force files. Interestingly, it is probably the only UFO on record that has bee Case 768 -- July 8, Boise, Idaho: Oliver Gregorson, Box 212, Boise, and Vesta Mitchell, of Route 5, Boise, reported to the Idaho Daily Statesman that they were about a mile and a half out of the city, on Route 20, at about sunset when they saw a number of silvery discs \"twirl ing in the sky, large and very high.\" (The sun set at 8:28 p.m. MST on July 8.) They said that two of the objects appeared much larger than the others. They were shiny and reflected th e rays of the setting sun, and as the two witnesses watc hed them, the two larger objec ts appeared to descend closer to the earth. Then, they said, the objec ts \"turned red and vanished.\""},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":" A moment or so following the disappearance of the objects, Gregorson and Miss Mitchell both saw \"fragments of ash\" floating toward the ground from the direction in which they had last seen the objects. They caught several samples of the ash as it came down, before it touched the ground. It was pearl-grey in color, and one fragment was of \"a shell-like material with bits of ash plastered all over it.\" One of the fragments was about the size of \"a rose leaf.\" According to the news accoun t, the witnesses gave the ashes to the paper, which in turn gave them to \"the state ch emist\" for analysis. On the following day, the Statesman reported that results of the analysis indicated the fragments were nothing but ashes, probably from paper. Chemists said definitely that they were \"not of a metallic residue.\" Case 802 -- July 9, Midland, Michigan: Mr. a nd Mrs. Raymond Edward Lane were picking berries shortly after 5:00 p.m. EST when they heard a kind of \"puff\" noise nearby. Looking up, they saw a ball of white, sparkling fire, like a Fourth of July sparkler, about the size of a bushel basket, no more than a hundred feet away. It was hovering several feet above a stretch of sand. After about ten or fifteen seconds, the fiery object \"went out,\" and the object va nished. The only thing remaining was a peculiar dark substance on the sand, and some metallic fragments. The report, from the Air Force files, is explained as a \"Possible hoax.\" ( IV – 2 ) The results o provided by the Air Force. Analysis does not, as such, constitute any proof of a hoax. On the contrary, it seems to confirm that som unusual natu re did occur, although it does not seem on the face of it to be necessarily connected with UFOs. e odd, f According to a letter from Lt. Colonel Barnett B. Young, dated August 18, 67, the incident, while classified as a hoax, \"was not initiated by the observer.\" Electromagnetic Effects f the analysis of the fragments and sand samples were eth ing of an The analysts apparently were given one sample of the metal -- an \"irregular somewhat rounded pellet\" which they state is principally silver. Impurities of one- tenth percent silicon are be lieved to be from sand picked up from the ground \"befor the metal solidified.\" The presence of molte n silver in a berry patch is certainly and rules out any simple \"hoax.\" A sample of the dark residue in the sand was also analyzed and its chief constituents were iron, aluminum and titanium in amounts o one-tenth percent each. Some of the fine powder in the sand at the site proved to be chiefly thorite, a rare mineral. 19 Case 30 -- June 24, in Cascade Mts., Oregon: On the morning of the same day that Kenneth Arnold made his sighting, a Por tland prospector, Fred M.

Case 386 -- July 6, Acampo, California: Resi dents of Acampo, a residential community just north of Lodi, reported th at they had heard a loud roar and saw a strange glow in the sky just before dawn. At the same time, the entire town had a power outage. Mrs. W. C.
