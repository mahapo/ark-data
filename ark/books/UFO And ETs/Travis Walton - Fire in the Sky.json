Asthe jetliner descended toward the Valley of the Sun, my mind reeled back, tenyears to the day.I’d been sitting in the library at Beverly Hills High (in the days before itszip code became a household word), listening to the radio on headphones,pretending to study. A five-minute newsbreak interrupted the rock and roll, andthe last item caught my distracted attention. . . .An Arizona man named Travis Walton was missing—and his coworkers came up withthe craziest excuse for his disappearance: He had been blasted by a ray of lightand taken away by a flying saucer, they said. It was clear from the tone of thereport that no one believed them. Murder was already being mentioned. The localnewsmen threw in the standard line about “little green men” . . . then theStones returned with a song about tumbling dice. But I wasn’t listening. I wasthinking about Travis Walton.Now, ten years later, I was touching down in Phoenix, on my way to Snowflake,Arizona, and a face-to-face meeting with Travis. As I hurried to catch acommuter flight, I ran into the pilot, who informed me that his plane wasgrounded. There was a storm over the White Mountains, and I was out of luck. Ioffered to double the money. No go.Storm? What storm? I looked up at the cool blue sky in frustration. My time waslimited; I had to be back in L.A. in three days, and I was determined to reachSnowflake.So I rented a car—a very special car according to Hertz—a brand-newfour-wheel-drive Peugeot—and I was off to Snowflake. For two hours I headed eastacross the desert, enjoying the sunshine and scenery in a way only a city boycan.And then it started to snow—in a big way.As ice, sleet, and snow pelted my little French car I made an interestingdiscovery: The windshield wipers didn’t work. I drove on in exasperation,sticking my head out the window and trying my best to follow the highway, thenglancing back through the mist for the racing flatbed that was sure to run medown at any moment.Near the old mining town of Superior, I pulled off the road and waited for thestorm to abate. I thought of Travis and the first time we’d spoken, a few daysearlier. I’d gotten his number from Snowflake Information; I later discovered ithad been unlisted for ten years—he’d just put it back in the phone book a day ortwo before I called. I took that as a good omen. The call had been spurred by adiscussion I’d had with producer Robert Strauss a week previous. The Walton casewas so interesting, so spectacular, why hadn’t anyone made a movie about it? Inmy preliminary talks with Travis, the answer became clear.The Travis Walton I knew only by voice seemed extremely suspicious of anyonefrom Hollywood. In fact, he seemed suspicious of anyone, period. So I wasjourneying to Snowflake for two major reasons: to convince him that I wassincere in my pledge to make a him that told his story truthfully, and to seefor myself if the case was a hoax. In my mind, the latter wasn’t a deal breaker.If the Walton incident was an elaborate ruse, I still felt that made for a greatstory that could be translated to the screen.The storm never ended; I arrived in Snowflake three hours later, half amazedstill to be in one piece. Over the course of the next few days and several moretrips to the area, I interviewed Travis and Dana Walton, Mike Rogers, KennyPaterson, John Goulette, Allen Dalis, Glen Flake, Marlin Gillespie, etc. I spokewith believers and disbelievers, well-wishers and scornmongers. In the end therewas only one conclusion I could possibly reach.The woodsmen had been telling the truth.Something built by nonhuman hands really did appear on the mountain that night.A piece of unreality had become all too real and had changed seven young men’slives forever. I was amazed by the skeptics’ lack of a reasonable alternative,and I was impressed by the amount of suffering the incident had caused thewoodsmen.Six and a half long years later, Fire in the Sky went into production. Why didit take so long? In the film business, things that should take a week take amonth. And every time we said, “Could we please have twenty million dollars tomake this movie?” . . . someone with twenty million dollars said no.It was my sad duty to report to Travis all the roadblocks and false alarms weexperienced during those years. I encouraged him to maintain the hope andexpectation that our film would eventually be made. Travis hung in there with usuntil we finally hit pay dirt. As the film was produced, shot, and edited, Icould sense his growing excitement, as well as the satisfaction he felt atfinally having the opportunity to have a large, nationwide audience vicariouslyrelive his experience. I know this book will enlighten and amaze the reader,just as the story of the Walton Seven first captivated me, half my lifetime ago.Travis Walton has changed since the time I first met him. His qualities of quiettruthfulness and deep introspective thinking are still the same, but the chip onhis shoulder has evaporated. He holds his head high now, confronts his criticsdirectly and readily accepts the fact that there are some who will alwaysdisbelieve. He is a family man of quality, at peace with himself and hisexperience. I’m proud to call him my friend."},{"pageContent":"PREFACEContextTo perceive is to suffer.—AristotleIt was many years ago that I got out of a crew truck in the national forest andran toward a large glowing object hovering in the darkening Arizona sky. Butwhen I made that fateful choice to leave the truck, I was leaving behind morethan just my six fellow workmen. I was leaving behind forever all semblance of anormal life, running headlong toward an experience so overwhelminglymind-rending in its effects, so devastating in its aftermath, that my life wouldnever—could never—be the same again.Nothing in this naive country boy’s life up to that moment could have preparedme for what followed. But what I didn’t know then, I think I know now. It’s beena real education! And with this new book I try to share those insights. When Ifirst wrote The Walton Experience (Berkley Books, 1978), the book whichParamount Pictures’ movie, Fire in the Sky, is based on, I stated my desire thatthe book put the reader where we were when it happened. My hope was that ifpeople could vicariously live it—somehow actually experience it as if they werethere in my stead—perhaps they could take a more open-minded and objectiveapproach to their evaluation of it all.However, nothing approaches the goal of allowing people to live someone else’sexperience nearly so well as a movie. I think most people knew better than toexpect a documentary, and although some dramatic license was exercised, Ibelieve that the movie succeeded in conveying the emotional essence of what wewent through. Public response to the film fulfilled all reasonable expectationsof all reasonable expectations of its makers. And it satisfied my goal ofimparting my experience on the gut level, so I feel free now in this updating toemphasize other areas. I provide an accurate, undramatized chronicle of events,and I account for the main departures that the film took from what actuallyhappened. I try to satisfy the interest which so many people have expressedconcerning why, after all this time, I finally consented to a movie being made,and what the process of its creation was like.One of the most neglected areas in the earlier book was the controversysurrounding the whole episode, the attacks by people who for various reasonsfelt compelled to try to deny that it had ever really happened. Many of thoseattacks were so ridiculously baseless that I naively believed a cursory rebuttalwould be sufficient. I thought those inclined to doubt could easily be pointedin a direction that would lead them to discover there was no truth in thealleged scenarios which had me or my coworkers hallucinating on drugs, creatinga hoax, suddenly becoming psychotic, etc. I wrote as if all these claims couldbe as easily refuted as the charge that the report was a cover story for a gorychainsaw murder.I could not have been more mistaken. The onslaught not only did not go away, itgrew. Refuted claims were continuously resurrected and, like a child’s game ofgossip, became more embellished with each telling.Therefore I devote my greatest efforts here to critical analysis of the myriadattempts to explain away what was otherwise recognized as the most spectacular,best-documented UFO incident ever.Another emphasis in this book is the context in which this incredible eventoccurred. People need to know more about the prior lives of the people involvedand the community in which it happened in order to understand its impact andaftermath. And the years of the aftermath are a story unto themselves, a storyso excruciating that my memories of what I have lived through because of somepeople’s reaction to what happened are a hell which nearly overshadows theexperience itself.Take a sleepy little Western town steeped in conservative, traditional values.Drop into its midst an event so shocking, so anomalous, that by its very natureit challenged conventional beliefs and attitudes, at the same time beingimpossible to dismiss, demanding to be confronted. That, pardner, was themakings of some serious turmoil.The UFO incident caused me to come in contact, directly or indirectly, with manypeople from all over the world whom I otherwise would never have known anythingabout. It so happened that most of them came from the larger cities. In many ofthose people I detected the attitude that it was good that this event occurredin such a place. If anything could make a bunch of hicks wake up and smell thecoffee, make them realize “there are more things in heaven and earth” thanallowed for in their pantheon of dear illusions, it was this sort of event; itwas just what these close-minded rubes needed to shake up their smug orthodoxy,to pull their blinders off so they might also begin to see a little more of themodern world outside their little corn-row rut.Perhaps. But I believe their attitude is metrocentric, their own dear illusionthat small towns are backward and cities are populated solely with hip,sophisticated, open-minded people with a much more accurate picture of “the realworld.”I have news for them. I’ve seen both sides and I can tell you that ruralcommunities have no corner on tunnel vision. Admittedly, these mountaincommunities are somewhat more homogeneous in their views, but there is far morediversity here than metrophiles assume. They seem to forget we’re plugged intothe same national media they are, not sitting here watching reruns of local newsfrom the 1950s. Granted, people here can be very certain of their truths, but nomore so than elsewhere. Living among people with a greater variety of viewpointsdoesn’t necessarily impart an openness to consider those viewpoints. Tolerancedoesn’t translate into open-mindedness. A diversity of self-certitudes is stillself-certitude.The more I discover of the world, the more I see how fundamentally alike peopleeverywhere actually are. In a broad sense we all share the same basic strengthsand failings, although to varying degrees. And it is this array of traits whichsome realists regard as being the cause of what is referred to as “the humancondition.”I’ve come to realize that the biggest problem anywhere in the world is thatpeople’s perceptions of reality are compulsively filtered through the screeningmesh of what they want, and do not want, to be true. People see what they expectto see. Preconceptions seem to predetermine judgment of everything. It’s notsolely because this human failing played such a big part in the experiences Irecount here that I consider it so important in the overall scheme of things. Ifyou look, you’ll find this human proclivity at the root of every single personalproblem or social ill humanity has ever endured. These mountain communities aremore a microcosm of the world than some would expect.Snowflake, Arizona. To some people from out of state, these two words sound likean oxymoron, a contradiction in terms. Many times I’ve had to persuade those onthe other end of long-distance phone lines that I was not joking. They just“know” that it never snows here in the Desert State, and besides, who wouldreally name a town Snowflake? Well, it does snow, quite enough, thanks. Not asmuch as some places in Arizona, but then, that isn’t where the name comes fromanyway. When I tell them the town was named for two of the founding families—theSnows and the Flakes—and that the Snows have all drifted away but there arestill plenty of Flakes here, they become certain I’m kidding.But Snowflake, ever since its founding in 1878, has been a town that people havebeen forced to take seriously. Rugged Mormon pioneers came into this area whenit was virtually wilderness and founded a number of towns here on the mountain.They hunted game, fought off wolves, bears, and lions, dammed streams, cuttimber, quarried rock, and built homes for their families. They farmed the landand herded sheep, cattle, and horses over large tracts of the surrounding area.They tamed their piece of the American West at a cost of great hardship and lossof life.My wife Dana’s great-grandparents, Smith D. Rogers and Eliza Snow Smith, wereamong the earliest settlers. Her grandfather Wilford was born in a log cabinhere in 1888. Snow blew through cracks in the cabin onto the bed where he cameinto this world, as the seventh of fifteen children, four of whom died beforereaching adulthood. He led a robust life full of hard work in the outdoors, butmade time for music and theater. He survived being buffeted by the elements,sickened by diphtheria, rolled over by a horse, and run over by a bus. The grandold man passed away a while back at the age of ninety-eight, able to outworkmost younger men nearly until the end of his life. Only the strongest survived.Snowflake has always held a disproportionate influence over larger towns in theregion. A high percentage of Snowflake residents are descended from the originalsettlers. There have been times when Flakes and other Snowflake founding-familynames have filled nearly every position of power and status in the county. Therewas once talk of moving the county seat to Snowflake.For a very long time Snowflake Union High School was the only one, attended fromnearly a dozen of the surrounding towns, some more than thirty miles away. Oneby one the other towns are building their own high schools, but the SHS Loboscontinue to win a larger portion of sports competitions, including the wolf'sshare of state championships. SHS has also had great success in orchestra,choir, marching-band competitions, spelling bees, and debate competitions. Theschool places in the top three every time the academic decathlon team competes.When the UFO incident happened in 1975, the town’s population was around 2,500,less than half its present size. Main Street is still basically about twelveblocks long; one whole block for the LDS (Mormon) church, one bank, a postoffice, a few small businesses. Most of the buildings are single-story; a fewlots on Main Street still haven’t been built on. All but one of the four servicestations have been supplanted by quick-stop mini-marts. Snowflake has yet to getits first stoplight.The years have seen a slow waning of the old lines of power. Outside influencescontinue to come in and take hold, some for the better, others not. Thepercentage of non-Mormon residents has continued to grow. Many of thetraditional ways remain, however. When I first moved here, two lawmen—a residentcounty deputy and one town marshal—were all the law enforcement the whole areahad. Now there’s a police force of ten and a number of resident county sheriff'sofficers. Even in a town where the smallest incidents are reported (unlikecities where people are so jaded they often don’t even bother to report beingthe victims of major crimes), Snowflake still has an astonishingly low crimerate. A rash of broken windows can make the local newspaper. Although drug abuseused to be virtually nonexistent here, we still have the lowest incidence in thestate. Some of the kids may complain that “nothing ever happens here,” but theirparents say, “Thank heavens for that.”The train is gone now. The Santa Fe Railroad pulled up the tracks through town awhile ago. Ranching isn’t nearly what it once was. Now the total output raisingpigs is more than double that of cattle; the nation’s largest pig farm islocated here. But forest product—related jobs have dominated the area’s economyfor a long time. This way of life may be in for an abrupt change here, alongwhat’s been called “America’s last frontier,” because of timber cutbacks due toenvironmental concerns.The old joke about rolling up and putting away the sidewalks at nine o’clockstill applies, except on Saturday dance nights. Journalists and movie peopleoften call this a “Last Picture Show ” kind of town. Western-style dress, thoughstill popular and in current revival, no longer completely dominates the fashionscene. But the annual Sweet Corn Festival, Pioneer Days Celebration, and theFourth of July Rodeo are still the biggest events of the year. The HomecomingGame Parade gets almost as big a turnout, since high-school football is takenvery seriously here. The year of the UFO incident, Snowflake defeated nearbyRound Valley during future gridiron star Mark Gastineau’s last year ofhigh-school play there. A number of athletes have left here for the pros.I think it was Robert Service who said that big spaces seem to produce big men.Arizona has always been a place of big spaces and probably always will be, sinceonly a tiny percentage of the state is privately owned. The rest is Indianreservations, state and federal land, and national forest.Arizona has been called a land of contrasts, and many of the borders of thosecontrasts seem to fall in the area around Snowflake. The region, called theWhite Mountain/Mogollon (moe gee on) Rim area, extends from the center ofArizona where the Rim begins and runs eastward into the White Mountains near theNew Mexico border. It ranges south from the high desert near the lowerboundaries of the Petrified Forest, the Painted Desert, and the Navajo and HopiIndian Reservations, continuing south to the still higher elevations of thewetter, alpine-forested Sunrise Ski Area up near the timberline on the ApacheIndian Reservation.Snowflake lies midway, in the scrub cedar and rolling prairie at the northernedge of the largest ponderosa pine forest in the world. In ages past,Snowflake’s valley was a vast lake, drained by a huge crack that opened up fromSnowflake to the Little Colorado River back about the time a space visitor ofanother sort impacted, sixty-some miles to the northwest, forming theworld-famous Meteor Crater. (Some speculate that the crack, as well as the bigsinkholes just northwest of town, happened because of the meteor.)There aren’t many such places, where you can snow-ski in the morning andwater-ski in the heat of a desert lake the afternoon of the same day. TurkeySprings, where the incredible series of events begins, is so high up on theMogollon Rim that it’s often inaccessible to workers or film crews for three orfour months of the year. The 7,500-foot-high ridge of the forested Mogollon Rim,twenty miles southwest of Snowflake, forms a long natural barrier to theprevailing winds. This shields the town and the surrounding area from the bruntof storms, which makes for the milder, if dryer, high desert climate.These open vistas and windswept sagebrush grasslands have been called lonely.Remote, yes. But loneliness is a subjective experience. A man working by himselfin the forest, miles from anything human, can feel more at one with the worldand far less lonely than another man sitting in his house in the middle of acommunity from which he feels set apart. What is to one man a rich, expansiverefuge of peaceful, reflective solitude, is to another man a bleak empty prisonof drab isolated boredom. Some men live in both. Pity the man of eitherperspective who is blind to the other.It’s inevitable that we find ourselves on one side of the lock or the other.Whether you think of yourself, or those on the other side, as locked in orlocked out, may be only a matter of perspective, with the one who seems tocontrol the key being a minor irrelevance. The satisfied see themselves aseither sheltered or liberated. The dissatisfied see themselves as either inmatesor exiles. To each his own.Fall, 1975. Nixon was out, Ford was in, and Watergate wouldn’t go away. Thehistoric Apollo/Soyuz joint mission of ’74 was still being toasted. Sakharov hadjust won the Nobel Peace Prize. But the towering threat of instant nuclearannihilation by a monolithic Soviet Union was still a perpetual shadow over theworld. More than one million died in the Khmer Rouge takeover of Cambodia.Scientists at the University of California at Irvine had recently announcedtheir findings that chlorofluorocarbons are rapidly depleting the earth’sprotective ozone shield against ultraviolet radiation from space. SqueakyFromme, Patty Hearst, and the Symbionese Liberation Army were in the news.Congress passed the Freedom of Information Act. The movie Jaws broke allbox-office records, and Jack Nicholson came into his own with an Academy Awardfor One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, which also took Best Picture. Pete Rosehelped the Cincinnati Reds win the World Series, and the Pittsburgh Steelers wonthe Super Bowl. My best friend, Mike Rogers, and I were very \"into\" martial artsand still pondering the mysteries of the recent death of Bruce Lee and theseeming invincibility of Muhammad Ali. Olivia Newton-John’s “Have You Never BeenMellow” and John Denver’s “Thank God I’m a Country Boy” were at the top of thepop charts. They were okay, but we preferred what might seem an unlikely mix ofmusic which included the easy country of Don Williams, some classical, early CatStevens, and especially the Moody Blues.In Snowflake, social trends have a way of lagging behind the rest of the nation.Even here, however, by late 1975 the fashion of longer hair on men had lost muchof its sixties countercultural statement, having become so mainstream that manycountry-western music stars were letting their hair grow. As a result, many ofthe men on our woods crew, even Mike and me, had longer locks than some of themore traditional town fathers considered respectable for red-blooded Americanmales, although it barely overhung our collars. Only one of our crew, KenPeterson, maintained the neatly cropped conventional haircut. We werered-blooded American males, but after the UFO incident, all it took were littlesigns such as these to confirm the notion for many locals that we were someliving example of why the golden ways of the past seemed to them to be eroding.It may seem quaint to speak of how hard labor builds character, but I’ve seenthe process in action too much not to believe in it. It’s more than thebalancing effect on brain chemistry of vigorous exercise. Occasionally men newto such work came to us from the city or from less-demanding jobs. Then theoutcome of the struggle between the demands of the job and the character withwhich they arrived would play itself out before us. Living on the “mean streets”seems to harden only the exterior, the part that relates to other people, thecultivated look of “badness.”For a man out there on the mountain, his battle, in a way, really isn’t withbaking sun, chilling winds, steep terrain, thorn bushes, or dangerous equipment.His battle isn’t with the rough roads, mud holes, biting insects, or gnarlythickets. The real struggle is with his inner self. Call it fiber, backbone, orgrit: true toughness is internal.The ability to keep going when he’s hot, thirsty, out of breath, when his handshurt and his muscles ache, while bark, bugs, pine needles, and sawdust arefalling down his shirt to stick in his sweat. The ability to say yes to more ofthis and no to the beckoning shade tree, because he knows he ought to andbecause that’s what he said he’d do. This can help give a man the power to sayyes or no—in the right instances—to just about anything and to act consistentlywith what he says. And, to confront daily the inflexible realities of a “realworld” that has teeth and bites back with immediate logical consequences,regardless of sophistical argument or politically correct rationalization, canteach something else now in short supply—common sense.In my case, hair past my collar wasn’t the only excuse for the localestablishment to look a bit askance at me. I’m going to tell you some thingsabout myself I’m not particularly proud of, but I’ll mention them only becausethey shed light on why I reacted to the UFO the way I did, and because they helpexplain to a degree the community’s reaction to what happened.I was a little wild in my younger days. I pulled some risky stunts on mymotorcycle that I cringe to look back on. I drove a number of very fast andunique cars in those days: a 1960 Pontiac Ventura that had a 389 engine with afactory three 2-barrel carburetor setup; a 1957 Chevy Nomad station wagon innearly perfect original condition; a 1969 Mustang Mach I with a 428 Cobra Jetengine; and, briefly, a 1968 Corvette Stingray with the rare (500-plushorsepower) L-88 427 engine. These were cars I could have kept whose currentworth would make collectors drool. I was no stranger to the quarter-mile stripsearlier generations had marked off on the straight stretches of highway outsideof town.When my older brother was headed off to Oklahoma to attend world rodeo champ JimShoulders’ bull-riding school, I, having never ridden a bull in my life, jumpedin the pickup with him and off we went. I had no dreams of being a rodeo starmyself, but took a bovine beating every day for a week, just for the experience.When Barroom Brawlers promoters came to the mountain to stage their version ofan amateur boxing, “tough man” contest, Mike and I went in and signed up. We didpretty well, so I also went and competed the next two years.Karate schools came and went in the White Mountain area, and Mike and I signedup every chance we got, getting exposure to a variety of instructors, differentmartial-arts styles, and different classmates to spar with.I’d take off to Mexico or thumb my way to Florida without much forethought.I hiked, fished, and hunted some pretty remote Arizona back country and I scaledsome pretty dangerous rock walls in the canyons in the area. One night when ourgroup challenged us, a friend and I went over the fence and climbed the Tower,all the way to the top of a microwave antenna so high you can see it from thirtymiles away. (Please, don't anyone else ever try this stupid stunt.)I did some partying and acting out in ways I lived to regret. Yeah, there werefights. Did I always win? Is anyone a winner in these kinds of things?A good while before the UFO incident, on another contract. Mike and I andanother crew were on our way home from work one day. Suddenly a black bear ranacross the road in front of the crew truck. Mike had to slam on the brakes toavoid hitting it. The bear stopped on the other side and looked back. I tookadvantage of the truck stopping to jump out and run straight toward the critter,roaring like I was an enraged grizzly. The bear fled as if its tail were onfire. I got back in the truck, as if nothing had happened, ignoring the looks onthe guys’ faces. I said in a low-key deadpan: “Huh. That one must’ve heard ofme.”It might have seemed impressive at the moment, but it wasn’t really anything.The bear was already intimidated by its near miss with the truck, and by the wayit only half turned around, I could tell it was already all set to hightail it.Just in case it didn’t, I was carefully gauging the relative distances betweenthe bear, me, and the safety of my empty seat in the truck. Usually, if apredator isn’t cornered, its reflex is to flee when chased, just as it willrespond by giving chase if you run away from it.Most of the foregoing was years before the UFO incident. I survived,surprisingly enough, without a single broken bone. I had a few isolated brusheswith the law, mostly traffic offenses, but nothing that left me with any record.It was a small part of my life, a brief phase I went through, but I paid theprices and really learned my lesson, and had not received so much as a trafficticket for a number of years before the UFO incident. In fact, it’s been likethat for all of the many years since my wayward phase.I really don’t like having to go into events of my wilder days. But I came torealize that, without the perspective provided by knowing these things about me,people will never understand the answer to what was for so many one of the moremystifying questions raised by my story: Why? The other men were either frozenin terror or frantically trying to find a way to crawl under the seats. Why wasI the only one brazenly to get out of the crew truck and approach such afearsome unknown? I kept getting this question, over and over again, for years.Perhaps now it’s a bit clearer what kind of man it took to react in that way.However, youthful bravado is only half the explanation for that apparentmystery. The acute embarrassment I feel in reviewing that time period will alsobe better understood from knowing something else about me. Another side to mypersonality ran deeper, more true to my real nature. I was possessed by aseemingly unquenchable thirst for knowledge, especially of a type othersconsidered off limits—not bad things, just things hidden, regarded as best leftfor a few, or truths that many deny solely from bias or fear. My all-consumingcuriosity was more powerful than my own fear, and at its zenith in my life theevening of November 5, 1975.Many of those who disapproved of my ways were probably in the throes of backlashto the changes time had brought to their world, and needed a culprit, as if Iwere an agent of those changes. How little they really knew about me.Small towns are always described as places where everyone knows everyone else.Actually, a small town is a place where people only think they know everyone.They know everyone’s name—but not always who they really are. I’ve heard manyrumors make the rounds about folks here that proved to be ridiculously falsewhen I finally got verifiable word. The more hush-hush the “scoop,” the furtherit’s likely to be from the truth. I’ve learned to hold off on drawing anyconclusions about late-breaking local news. Getting the facts straight right offis so rare that it amazes me how many people are willing to jump prematurely toconclusions that so often prove false.However, it’s human nature for most people to view their own pasts through arosy haze, while their memories of the wrongs of others are indelible. I teachmy kids about the fragility of one’s reputation. Very old people might forgeteverything else about the early years, but few have any trouble recalling whichgirls were known as “easy” and the name and deeds of the school bully. When Iwas in high school I took part in a protest of the high-school dress code. Nowthat I have a son there with some of the same teachers, it’s kind of funny tonote the misgivings I felt when the school board recently voted to concede andrelax standards on some of those same old issues.There was a greatly underestimated intellectual side to me. I think I caused alittle dismay in some of those who rarely would see me take a textbook home,would see me cut class, then on Friday rumble up to the high school on mymotorcycle, walk in, and ace the test. It seemed a refutation of their ethic,especially for certain teachers who I’m sure felt they were seeing a living nonsequitur—“People like that can’t get high grades.”Still, there were a few times I just let things slide. I actually dropped out ofhigh school with only a year to go; but I came back, buckled down, graduated,and obtained grants to attend all three of the universities to which I applied.I chose to attend NAU, Northern Arizona University (the Lumberjacks, ofcourse!). I kept changing majors—electronic engineering, law, psychology,medicine, liberal studies—not because I lacked sufficient interest, but becauseI was so interested in everything.I really had no reason to expect to be seen as I truly was. I made sure no oneknew what I had been like before my family moved to Snowflake in 1968 fromPayson, Arizona, where I’d been known as a goody-goody, sensitive, an eggheadnerd! I was called “Einstein,” “mad scientist,” and nicknamed “the Professor.”So I came here determined to leave that pigeon-hole behind. But I only succeededin getting myself into another, equally ill-fitting pigeonhole as a rebel.Nevertheless I privately continued my intellectual inquiries into a wide varietyof subjects such as philosophy, religion, art, languages, music, science, andliterature (including the works of Ayn Rand, beginning with Atlas Shrugged, butespecially her nonfiction).I recall that for my twelfth Christmas I received a copy of Isaac Asimov’sIntelligent Man’s Guide to Science, the first brand-new book I’d ever owned;it’s still in my personal library, now grown to well over a thousand volumes.Though much of that edition is still relevant, it’s interesting to read howdated some of science has become, what hadn’t yet been discovered, and amusingto read how humanity was “aiming firmly for the moon.” I’ve never read any ofAsimov’s fiction, but I’ve accumulated quite a few of his hundreds of otherworks.It would be hard to characterize the particular subjects that intrigued me,because I don’t subscribe to the usual limits. There is nothing that shouldn’tbe examined. Many people avoid reading the works of those with whom theydisagree, but I find these to be some of the most stimulating.I have some Cherokee in my immediate ancestry on my mother’s side, so I delvedinto the language and history of the Cherokee nation. The Cherokee’s status asone of the so-called “Five Civilized Tribes” didn’t prevent President AndrewJackson from ordering in the 1830s the forced foot march of the tribe from theirhomelands on the East Coast to reservations half a continent away in Oklahoma.There was tremendous suffering and death among those herded along by soldiers,on what became known as the Trail of Tears. My great-grandfather was a chief whoescaped the procession and settled in Tennessee before later rejoining hispeople in Oklahoma.I became a state-certified EMT (Emergency Medical Technician). I worked at thenearby Show Low airport to pay for my private-pilot ground school and flyinglessons. I worked on a number of inventions I came up with for automotiveapplications. When midwives I knew told me they had been taking the collegelicensing preparation course and studying for the state midwife licensingexamination, I borrowed their textbooks a few days before the test and readthem. Since the statute permitted persons who had not taken the college classesto take the test, I took the exam with dozens of midwives from around Arizona,some of whom were registered nurses who had already been practicing midwiferyfor years under physicians’ supervision. I received the second-highest score outof the entire group, just behind a lady who had actually taken the collegecourse.I was a person who seemed to be from two worlds. People from both worlds didn’tknow quite how to take me, each probably believing I was of the other. Adding tosome of the friction between me and one or two guys on the crew was my attitudetoward smoking and drinking. They seemed to miss the distinction betweenrefusing to drink with them and simply refusing to drink.Snowflake residents, I think, viewed me as an outsider. My moving to town fromelsewhere and my church inactivity contributed greatly to that impression. Inever told anyone, but my Mormon roots were as deep as anyone’s. They didn’tknow it but, going way back, I’m actually related to some of them. Mygreat-great-grandfather, Joseph Walton, was among the pioneer families to settlethe Utah Valley with Brigham Young. Joseph Walton helped build, and lived in,Wordsworth Fort in Alpine, Utah. He served under Captain Carlisle and SergeantJohn Langston as a soldier in the Fifth Tenn, a Mormon militia company, andlater as a police officer. He saw a lot of trouble with Indian raids, includingthe Walker War and the Black Hawk War, and endured the same hardships as theother pioneers in taming the Utah Valley. His son, my great-grandfather, JohnJames Walton, worked in Brigham Young’s household to pay his way in becoming oneof a small number in the very first graduating class of the Brigham YoungAcademy, later known as Brigham Young University.I’ve gone through major changes. Now that I bring these things out, some ofwhich I’d like to deny, I’m put in the position of counseling my kids to do as Ido, not as I did. The UFO incident was a sharp turning point for me. There wereother reasons, too, though ... an accumulation of smaller lessons, generalmaturity, and the realization that such a background, smokescreen or not, can bethe kind of thing that can put the lady of your dreams beyond reach.I admit it wasn’t easy for people to understand the complexities and apparentcontradictions of my personality. How could the shy person they met one time bethe same grandstanding guy they would see at another time? Now that I no longerhave a reckless side, it’s a little easier for people to understand me, or tothink they do.I still love and enjoy the outdoors, although I haven’t been hunting in ages. Iused to kill rattlesnakes whenever I came across them, just like everyone else.Now I just let them go their way and I go mine. I still try to stay fit and livehealthy. I’m not so quick to anger or to try and resort to physical solutions toconfrontations. First I’ll exhaust every possible rational, logical solution,because the truth is, I’ve found that there usually is one. The thing toremember is that if you’re living as right as you know how, if someone has aproblem with you, chances are, the problem is their own, which should obviateemotional reactions born of defensiveness. In other words, you don’t have totake it personally.Don’t get the idea I’ve lost any spark, however. I’ve just redirected thoseenergies into more productive outlets. I’d prefer to be a thinker and a loverthan a fighter—if others will let me.I wouldn’t want this personal reordering to give the impression that I buy intothe anti-ego disease that is spreading through society. Vanity is a characterflaw (actually a cloak for low self-esteem), but ego is the wellspring of thepsyche. It’s an inescapable fact of life. The person who criticizes you fortaking pride in excelling is really implying this illogical nonsense: “You aresaying you are good relative to someone else [probably me], and that is bad. I,however, am not taking pride in my good qualities; but that is good. Therefore,because I’m egoless and I have shown you the error of your ways, I am goodrelative to someone else [namely, you].”Loggers are a competitive lot, and our crew was no exception, especially Mikeand me. We were always really competitive on the job—and about the job itself,too. Who could cut the most trees, who could go the longest without dulling hischain on a rock, etc. The contract specifications based tree sizes onDBH—diameter at breast height—because diameters near the ground don’t correlatewell to actual size. We’d have moneyless wagers to see who could most closelyguess what diameter the scale would read without touching the tree, and atvarious distances from the tree.We were very competitive concerning ideas, too. We would debate all kinds ofthings, not just philosophy. Current events, things going on in our lives and inthe lives of those around us—even job-related subjects. Logically proving ourown position was the game, and the struggle brought us naturally to the rules ofthat game. The drives to and from work were always long, but we would fill thetime with talk of many fascinating things.The guys on the crew who didn’t have a taste for all that found some of the talka little bewildering. “Would you guys quit arguing, for hell’s sake?” they’dsay; and, “Who in hell gives a damn about why humans enjoy hearing music?Embryological neuro-artifacts of mathematical harmonics bullshit! Ain’t itenough to know what sounds good to you? Why do you guys have to pry intoeverything? What’s it ever going to get you? All you guys ever do is argue.” Butthere were some who, although surprised, took a liking to it and jumped right inand held their own.We would have challenges to see who could predict where a tree would fallwithout a nudge. Games of reaction time, little unspoken duels, such as seeingwho could keep from being the first to say, “Let’s break,” or “Let’s call it aday.” Seeing who’d be first to get his saw started or race back to the truck.Who could most closely estimate the distance between two trees, or how manyman-hours it would take to complete a given acreage.As a ponderosa pine grows, its lower limbs die off and new ones are added to thetop. Normally they get drier and drier until wind or snow breaks them off. Askarate practice, we’d have matches to see who could snap-kick off the highestlimb above our heads without falling on his can. Being taller, I always won thisone. We would take one of the round files we sharpened our chains with and seewho could throw it and stick it closest to the center of the end of a log. Mikeusually won this one. We would compete to see who’d be fastest to get his sawthrough a log. Mike usually won this one, too.I guess Mike has more sawdust in his veins. Mike’s father, Lyle, became a loggerin 1947, at first using the manual crosscut saws they called “Swedish violins,”since engine-driven chainsaws hadn’t yet come into use. When Mike was growingup, he helped his dad in the woods. Lyle has done tree thinning intermittentlyfor the U.S. Forest Service since leaving the railroad, and is still doing it atthe age of seventy-plus. Mike’s grandpa, George Howard, planted trees in theforest in Nebraska before becoming a forest ranger in Colorado. After GrandpaGeorge left the Forest Service, he was in timber-related work the rest of hislife. And Mike’s mother, Joyce, was born two months premature when her parentswere snowed in at a ranger station near Yampa, Colorado, during the worst stormof the year. She spent her girlhood living in various lumber camps. Aside frombeing a born woodsman, all that competitiveness on the job probably helped Mikewhen he entered the big lumberjack contests, where he did well.Mike had been bidding U.S. Forest Service thinning contracts since he was onlynineteen years old. In the fall of 1975, I’d just helped him finish out hisCandy Mountain contract up near the Blue Wilderness Area. Now that was some job.We were above 10,000 feet. There were times there when we found ourselveslooking down at the clouds! It’s beautiful green country, thick with wildberries and abundant with wildlife—but, brother! can that altitude make youbreathe hard when you work. Heck, just carrying your saw back up the hill to thecrew truck can make you gasp. No wonder. That’s the altitude above which it isrecommended for pilots to have pressurized cabins or to use supplemental oxygen.Most of the Candy Mountain crew had left for one reason or another, and so forTurkey Springs Mike had been adding some men. Including Mike, there was a totalof seven of us working on that contract at the time of the incident.I first became friends with Mike while attending high school with Mike’s youngerbrother, whom I had joined working for Mike during our summer recesses.Ken Peterson I’d known for years. Mike had known him all his life, having grownup together. Everyone always thought of Ken as a really decent guy. A formerhigh-school athlete, he was a quiet, introspective sort, always polite, a realstraight arrow. Very conventional in his dress, manner, and behavior, but also adeep thinker, and religiously a bit restless, a searcher. He lived by hisbeliefs, but he wasn’t pushy about it. He’d speak up about men smoking orswearing on the job, but it was more in defense of his right to his personalenvironment than about converting or imposing his beliefs on others. He was asteady worker and got along well with everyone, though he tended to talk morewith Mike and me than the others.Except for me, Allen Dalis had been there longest, outlasting a number of othermen who came and went over the summer. He was more experienced, too, becausehe’d worked for Mike before. There had been a few rough moments between Allenand others on the crew, including a fistfight with Mike a month or so earlier.He’d led a troubled life growing up in Phoenix, but he could also be a realcharmer when he chose to. My own troubles with him were forgotten as far as Iwas concerned. His dark side notwithstanding, he was downright likable much ofthe time. Besides, he was a heck of a good sawyer.John Goulette was the closest thing to a sidekick for Allen in the crew. Johnhad worked for Mike before on a couple of occasions when Allen had also. Johnand Allen had completed service in the navy, and they were friends, but Johnreally wasn’t a lot like Allen. Although he knew how to have a good time, he wasquite a bit more easygoing. He got along well with the rest of the crew, buttended to pair off with Allen.John Goulette had been living in Phoenix and he’d been back there the previousweekend. He brought back with him a gangly, six-foot-seven guy named DwayneSmith, who was looking for a job. He was new to this sort of work and he’d onlybeen there three days, so I didn’t know much about him. Being new, he wasn’tvery outgoing, and tended to keep with Allen and John. There was a littleheckling going on between him and “the kid,” Steve Pierce, who returned fire bycalling Dwayne “Herman Munster” because of his height. Steve’s family weren’tarea natives, but his family owned land east of Snowflake. Steve had been withus for a few weeks. He was the youngest on the crew, but he was strong and bigfor his age. It looked as if he was going to work out okay.So there we were. A mixed group of personalities, with various friendships andantagonisms, all headed off toward work in the mountains of northern Arizona,and the experience of a lifetime."},{"pageContent":"PART 1The Incident"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1First, an Open MindBy reason only can we attain to a correct knowledge of the world and a solutionof its great problems.—Ernst Heinrich HaeckelBefore giving the eyewitness account of the sighting and subsequent events, Iwant to appeal to reason and briefly explain why I go into the matter once more,after so much time.For a while it seemed that everyone wanted to know more about the UFO incident.They wanted to know if anything so incredibly bizarre could actually happen. . .Could it? Well, it did, but unfortunately, often it was the tendency of a greatmany people to consider only those facts which supported their preconceivedbeliefs—not only the lay public, but also scientists, lawmen, and newsmen. Boththe skeptics and even those who accepted the truth of our experience were oftenguilty of making up their minds on the basis of only part of the evidence.Scientific testing took time, and many people did not want to wait until all thefacts were in before reaching a conclusion.There was “something for everyone” in the early news reports of the incident. Acontroversy raged that offered evidence to confirm any particular bias a personmight choose, and offering food for thought for the unprejudiced and morelogical individuals.Every time I read a newspaper or magazine article about my experience, it waswith outraged exasperation. Not one of the written accounts of my experience wasentirely correct. I’m not referring only to reports which took the disbelievingviewpoint. We’re all entitled to our opinions in matters of opinion. However, inmatters of fact we are not. I’m referring to those reports which garbled basicfacts of an indisputable nature—names, ages, places, even the sequence ofevents; reports in which quotations from nearly everyone involved were pureinvention. Reports that repeated the vaguest rumors and even things which asimple check could have disproved before they were put before millions ofpeople.A number of so-called experts appeared very foolish by coming out in the mediaand speaking too soon. They made public statements as if from established fact,which were proven totally false when the real evidence was publicized. Seeingthese things, I would tell the next interviewer how no one ever seemed to get itright. He would sympathize, assuring me that he would straighten things out.Sure enough, when his article came out, words I hardly recognized would beenclosed by quotes and labeled “Walton said.” I started really overemphasizingthe problem, even asking interviewers to repeat the basic facts back to me. Butthe errors continued.The difficulty was not lessened by the silence I maintained, at first, to themedia. They printed what they could get, which was not much. So the problem wasnot entirely their fault, as the profession of journalism has its own built-incomplications. An hour-long interview is condensed into a half page of shorthandnotes. When those are expanded and organized into a full-length article, how canit possibly be accurate? The contrast is like that between reconstituted orangejuice and the freshly squeezed stuff. The general flavor is there, but somethingis missing.The difficulties the interviewers had became even more understandable to meafter I began this book. I had my own share of troubles in trying to achieveabsolute accuracy—and I’m the one it happened to. In researching the facts, Ifound that people’s memories posed a problem. If it was only that their recallhad faded, it would not be so bad. But people tend to remember things a littledifferently as time goes by. Even if they remember something exactly as theyexperienced it, they might not have perceived it correctly. A dozen people canwitness the same automobile accident and all have a different recall of theevent. I dealt with this problem by eliminating versions that did not agree withthe majority, and by checking with written records.I racked my brain for even the most insignificant detail about the sometimesenigmatic thing that had happened to me. The description of the incident andevents immediately following it is as nearly accurate as I was able to make it,and it is repeated from an account that I wrote while the facts were fresh.There were reasons for my writing this book other than the need to set therecord straight. For one thing, my reserved nature made me want to avoid beingeternally interviewed. But at the same time, I had experienced something that Ifelt should be shared and recorded. In this book I satisfy both those goals.When some people expressed so much intense curiosity, and others, out of fear,tried to explain away what had happened, I kept thinking, If only they couldhave been there! Therefore, I have tried to relate these experiences in a waythat will allow you, the reader, to relive them and feel what we felt at thetime it was all happening. Even in parts where I was not on hand, I haveattempted, from careful interviews with those who were there, to reconstruct thescenes just as they occurred, to impart a sense of presence for the reader.My coworkers were faced with similar problems, continually asked what they’dseen, or when they were told that they did not even know what they’d seen. Tohelp explain it to others, and to demonstrate that they had no doubts about whatthey had witnessed, Michael Rogers brought the group’s collective descriptionsto life in the painting entitled The Walton Experience.Mike Rogers was mysteriously inspired to paint better than he ever had before.This, after not having painted in over ten years! Mike had at first intendedonly to portray the original incident, but when I saw the precision of detail heexpressed, I asked him to help me recreate my experience in art form. His mostrecent additions show how much his ability has grown. Mike knows me and he knowswhat I mean when I describe something. Still, in the drawings of the beings Iencountered, Mike drew over twenty representations, all of which fit the verbaldescription, before I picked out the one closest to what they had actuallylooked like.If only they could have been there! I thought. I hope that I have beensuccessful in creating something that puts you where we were that Novembernight.My six coworkers and I did not set out to “prove” the truth of our experience.Circumstances at the time of the incident made it necessary to report it to lawenforcement officials. The media picked it up and after that, it became simply amatter of defending ourselves against a wild variety of accusations. This is notto say that all the reports in the media were negative. Most of the news reportswere positive, or at least gave unbiased coverage of the overall account. Butfor the record, all the misinformation and mistaken conclusions need to be setstraight.It is easy to sympathize with those who find it all difficult to accept. If theythink they feel incredulous about it, then they should be able to appreciate howdifficult it was for seven tree-cutters to adjust to. We were the ones ithappened to. Yet we had our own share of difficulty accepting what our ownsenses adamantly told us we had experienced.There were inevitably demands for proof. With little or no remaining physicalevidence, absolute proof was impossible to produce. However, as we shall see,the additional testimony by law enforcement officials and scientific researchersoffered overwhelming evidence that it did indeed happen just as we reported it.Imagine our dilemma. If we could have produced hard physical proof such asbringing in a crashed saucer on the back of a truck, or dragging in an alienbeing in chains, we might possibly have found ourselves in a more believableposition. Even if I could have brought back some piece of physical “proof,”there were some hardcore disbelievers who still would not accept it. Forexample, there were many people who insisted that man would never make it to themoon. They swore that God would never allow it. Perhaps modern technology isfrightening to them. If man were meant to go to the moon, he would have been putthere, they said. When man did set foot on the moon in 1969, most of themconveniently forgot their previous predictions. But a few hardcore disbelieversinsisted that man never did go to the moon and that it was all a television hoaxon the part of the government!Religious convictions are a considerable source of bias in the matter ofextraterrestrial visitors. It is not necessarily a religious matter—no more thanthe question of simple life on Mars is a religious matter. Unless yourparticular religion denies that there are such things, it is an academic matterrather than a religious one. Nevertheless, people made unnecessary religiousinterpretations, pro and con, concerning the concept of visitation of earth bylife from other worlds.The average individual is going to believe what he wants to believe, regardlessof evidence or facts. Those who believe we had a UFO experience are going tobelieve exactly that and those who scoff will continue to scoff. However, thereis hope. There are alive today totally unbiased, rational individuals (you?) whomake judgments solely on the basis of logic. People who are actually capable ofwithholding judgment indefinitely if there is insufficient evidence for them tobase a conclusion on.My six coworkers and I know that the incident did, in all reality, happen. Wehave our memories to help us accept the truth of our incredible experience. Youare not so fortunate (or unfortunate, depending on where you’re sitting). Youhave only your powers of reason. Here’s the straight of it. The conclusion isyours.“Condemnation without investigation is the height of ignorance.\"—Emerson"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2An Ordinary DayOne impulse from a vernal woodMay teach you more of man,Of moral evil and of good,Than all the sages can.—WordsworthIt was the morning of Wednesday, November 5, 1975. To us, the seven men workingin Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, it was an ordinary workday. There wasnothing in that sunny fall morning to foreshadow the tremendous fear, shock, andconfusion we would be feeling as darkness fell.It often amazes people from out of state to discover these forests inArizona—the “arid zone.” Arizona conjures up to them a hostile image of barerock, cactus, and sandy deserts. Yet we also have hundreds of square miles ofgreen forests. A mixture of oak, fir, and pine covers over a quarter of thestate. Arizona Rocky Mountain High! Television westerns probably make for somepretty wild ideas about the southwestern U.S. I once heard of a lady touristinquiring as to whether we had much trouble with Indian attacks! Our manypicturesque blue mountain lakes, forest meadows, and the stark white andemerald-green quaking aspen trees are just not in keeping with the parchedmirage projected by the movies.We were working on the Turkey Springs tree-thinning contract. Basically,thinning involves spacing and improving the thick stands of smaller trees toallow for their faster growth. Even a virgin forest has dense thickets of smalltrees that require many years for natural dominance to select which of the treeswill survive. Thinning speeds up the natural selection by cutting the imperfect,diseased, and damaged trees, thereby spacing the remaining ones—all according toa set of well-researched specifications set down in the Forest Serviceguidelines.The sign at the entrance to Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest bears the words“Land of Many Uses.” Thinning assists nearly every one of the Forest Serviceprograms for multiuse of all the forest resources. The decreased tree densityallows for increased grazing. Watershed is increased by millions of gallonswithout increased erosion. Hunting, fishing, and even recreation are land-usesthat benefit from thinning.That day, November 5, we were cutting a fuel-reduction strip up the crest of aridge running south through the contract. Fuel reduction is the process ofcutting the thinning slash into lengths and piling it up to be burned in the wetseason. The loggers who had cut the area before us had used their bulldozers topush their logging slash into huge piles on the same strip. The Forest Serviceburns all the piles, carefully keeping them under control, at a time when firedanger is lowest in terms of moisture and wind. This eliminates almost all ofthe flammable fuel in 150-yard-wide strips that section off nearly the entireforest. If a fire starts, it will not burn far before running into one of thesefuel breaks and, hopefully, it will not be able to burn any farther.When we are piling, some of the men run saws while the others pile. I wasrunning a saw, as were Allen Dalis and John Goulette. Dwayne Smith, KennethPeterson, and Steve Pierce were piling behind the cutters as we worked our wayup the strip.Second break came (none too soon) after about three hours of work since firstbreak. Mike shouted loudly over the noise and gave the signal, thumbs up, thenpointed to his watch. We shut off our saws and the forest stillness returned.For half an hour, quiet would reign again. I stopped and wiped the sweat off myforehead before carefully setting my hot saw on a nearby stump. We charged downthe hill to the truck parked in the road below and grabbed our lunches. Some ofthe men sat in the truck and others sat outside on the carpet of pine needles.Everyone started eating. I was starved—but that was nothing unusual. Hard workin high, thin air can really burn up the calories. I was the object of a lot ofribbing from the crew about my appetite on account of my oversized “lunchbox.” Ibegan carrying my lunch in a small suitcase after finding that even two ordinarylunchboxes could not handle the amount of food I required to be able to cuttrees all day.Those guys didn’t have much room to talk. They ate a considerable amountthemselves; most of them carried their own lunches in large, brown paper grocerybags. Besides, I only weighed 165 pounds, which was light for my height andframe. We all found it necessary to take two lunch breaks during the day. It wasjust too much to go for two four-hour stretches without eating. I never noticedany of them dragging their heels when break time finally arrived.I sat and ate in the dusty old work-truck. It was a 1965 Internationaldouble-cab, painted a dirty brown with a mud-stained white roof and hood, withsome rough wooden sideboards on the back. This dented-up rattletrap was all thatstood between us and a long walk back to civilization.After the roads out there at Turkey Springs had finally finished off the ’72Chevrolet van we used to ride to work, we started using the International. Itsfirst days had established a poor precedent by which to judge its futureperformance. We had trouble with it every day for two weeks, including flattires, fuel-line problems, leaking radiator hoses, thrown fan belts, gettingstuck, and running out of gas. Some of these problems resulted in getting homequite late, but worse yet were the long walks it forced us to make. More thanonce we began the trek up and down the hills back to Heber. Each time we werelucky enough to be picked up, tired and footsore, by a passing vacationer or oneof the local ranchers. After those first incommodious weeks, we had no moremalfunctions. Strangely, the truck settled down to function smoothly, mile afterrugged mile. I began to place a tentative trust in the well-seasoned machine.The pickup was parked on what might very loosely be called a primitive road.This dirt track was in terrible shape, as the battered gas tank on the undersideof the truck could attest. The underchassis would scrape over water-bars in theroad, which are called “thank-you-ma’ams” for some forgotten reason. (Maybe it’sbecause of the wham, bam you get from crossing them too fast. Gratitude was theleast of our feelings for them.) These humps of dirt prevented the road fromwashing out in the rainy seasons. But they also prevented practical travel ofthe road in anything less tenacious than a Sherman tank.That “road” might have been more accurately termed “obstacle course.” Inaddition to the water-bars, there were fallen logs and large, round boulders inthe path—so many, it was more sensible to weave the truck around them than toclear the way. All this zigzagging made the half mile from the Rim Road to thework site half again as long. Maneuvering that long double-cab pickup over thattortuous trail was slow progress.The short piece out to the Rim Road was the worst of the trip. From there it wasa somewhat better dirt road winding the thousand feet back down to Heber,Arizona, fifteen miles to the north, and from there on, it was anotherthirty-three paved miles east to Snowflake.The contract was bordered on the south by the Rim Road, which clings to the topedge of the 7,500-foot-high Mogollon Rim, a ridge extending nearly three hundredmiles east-west through northern Arizona. The Mogollon Rim actually forms a highcliff in many places, and, in the area south of Turkey Springs, drops steeplyinto the Apache Indian Reservation. Land north of the Rim very graduallydescends into a rolling plain known as the Mogollon Plateau.These cool autumn days are some of the best of the year for working. The lack ofheat and wind allows us to maintain a reasonably comfortable workingtemperature. Although it can get bitterly cold at night, it usually gets up to apleasant forty or fifty degrees in the middle of the day—still cool enough to bebracing. During the summer rainy season, we have to worry about getting stuckand digging the pickup out of mudholes. Those unpredictable downpours willsometimes completely interrupt our workday, wasting our forty-eight-mile drive.Allen Dalis and John Goulette were leaning against an old gray log in the sun,eating their sandwiches. Both were twenty-one, had recently served out theirobligations in the navy. They tended to keep to themselves and did not join intalk much of the time. They preferred to swap stories about the partying theyhad done and the women they had met in various ports overseas.Ken Peterson was a blond, blue-eyed six-footer—a typical clean-cut, all-Americanboy. He had been good in sports in high school. At twenty-six he still lookedlike an overgrown kid. Ken had gotten more serious about life lately. He had anew son by the pretty little senorita he had married from south of the border. Iwas engrossed in my apple and did not join in the religious discussion Mike andKen had struck up.We talked about everything under the sun during our breaks and on the long drivehome. We had conversations about religion, politics, and, of course, women. Wetalked about karate a lot. We touched on just about every subject of interest tous. Lusty outdoor activity really brings the mind alive and stimulates interestin life.Dwayne Smith was a quiet sort; I did not know too much about him. He looked tobe about twenty-one. John had brought him up from Phoenix only two days before.He sat on a stump nearby and ate without talking much. He was more than six feetseven inches tall and his height did not lend easily to the repeated bendingover involved in piling. But, for a green man, he was doing surprisingly well.He had been piling behind me and was good at keeping up, so far. I was going towait to see how Dwayne panned out. A lot of new men jump out there and make likea ball of fire to impress the boss and the rest of the crew with what hardworkers they are. Then they quit in a few days when the accumulating fatiguewears them down. Or some hit it hard, but cannot get themselves to work everyday. They make some excuse to take off during the week to recuperate. I figureit’s best to hit a pace that is fast but still easy enough to keep up day afterday.Steve Pierce was laughing at something John had said to Allen. Steve was a big,husky, dark-haired kid who looked older than he was. Mike did not know it, butSteve was only seventeen. Steve came from a family with a strong work ethic, sowhen he quit school he had to find a job.The autumn sun slanting weakly through the tall stands of pine was failing totake the fall chill from the air. A large crow swooped close for a curious lookat us, the sunlight flashing on its shiny black feathers. Its hoarse cawingannounced our resting presence to the whole forest (as if our saws had notalready done so) and it flapped higher on the crisp air. Not a solitary cloudcluttered the azure hemisphere arching overhead. For as far as I could see,there was nothing but clear blue sky. Sky that borders infinite space—as we soeasily forget by day.The conversation usually begins to pick up after we’ve eaten. During the firstpart of our lunch breaks, we concentrate on knocking the sharp edge off ourappetite. The birds slowly regain their confidence and begin chirping andflitting through the trees. Only after things really quiet down do we becomeconscious of the ever-present whispering of the wind through the treetops. Justabout the time the woods return to normal, when we get cooled down, startrelaxing, and talk gets interesting, our break ends.Abruptly the crew boss, Mike Rogers, let go an intermittent blast on the horn ofthe International. Our half-hour break was over: time to put our coats on andour noses back to the grindstone. We topped off our gas tanks and cranked up.This one-pint fueling would run the machine for almost an hour, cutting downhundreds of trees on less than twenty cents’ worth of fuel. With all due respectfor our sturdy lumberjack predecessors, this is not bad efficiency—when youconsider trying to use an axe to do the same thing.The chains on our saws are always filed razor-sharp for maximum cutting speed.With five horsepower behind them, those chains can rip a six-inch-diameter treeoff its stump in less than one second. Building so much power into such a lighttool makes it easy for the chain to grab the wood and kick back at the operator.It seems that everyone who works very long with a chainsaw gets cut—and a sawblade cuts flesh like a hot knife through butter.A newly hired man usually cuts himself within the first few days. The ease withwhich those whirling, knifelike teeth can mangle flesh is always a stunningrevelation to the uninitiated. Some of the most horrible wounds you can imaginehave resulted from chainsaw cuts. The chain can shred the muscles in a man’s leginto hundreds of bloody strips in a split second. It is a surgeon’s nightmare totry to stitch these wounds back together, and they are slow in healing. Newrecruits are required to wear a tough guard on their left leg for the first fewdays on the job. The deep slashes that accumulate in the guard often fail toinstill caution in the wearer. When the guard is removed, the man promptly cutshimself. Then ... he learns. Often the man never cuts himself again after thatfirst lesson. Some men get away with only minor nicks, but all the saw operatorshave scars—gruesome diplomas of lessons in practical experience.The boss, Mike Rogers, was twenty-eight, the oldest of the seven men. He hadbeen bidding these thinning contracts from the Forest Service for nine years.That had been long enough to learn (the hard way) all the tricky pitfalls of thebusiness. He was getting to where he could fairly consistently gauge the priceper acre that would underbid the other contractors and still allow a profitmargin. Turkey Springs was the best contract, profitwise, Mike had ever beenawarded. In fact, it paid the highest acre-price he had ever received.It is production in terms of acres that determines how much profit you can makein thinning. Two factors affect this: the tree density relative toprice-per-acre, and the amount of ground the crew can cover in a given span oftime. Mike hired the fastest cutters he could get and paid the sawyers an hourlyamount based on their cutting efficiency and speed.I had worked with Mike off and on during the seven years I had known him. Mikenever tried to dominate his men, unlike some of the other men I had worked for.Rather than ordering his men around, Mike gets cooperation by simply tellingthem what needs to be done. A man only gets paid if he does his job, so lordingit over employees is an unnecessary ego trip for a practical man like Mike. Thejob was just the thing for my independent nature.I had lived the first half of my life in the desert city of Phoenix, beforemoving with my family into the forested mountain area of the state. Before I gotinto thinning, I cut and loaded pulpwood logs for a year or two. However,pulpwood, thinning, and the other jobs I had held, had been only part-time workafter school and for summer vacations. Up until I left school I held a widevariety of jobs, never getting in a rut. The changes of pace were good, butthinning was always the most likable work. It was then paying better than itever had, so there I was at twenty-two, thinning trees for a living.I enjoy seeing the deer and other animals in the woods, but I would see no deerthat day, nor any other animal with any sense. It was deer-hunting season andthe fools from the city would shoot at anything that moved. I had been hearingthe crack of high-powered rifles from all directions that morning. The sound ofour saws carries great distances, but the noise doesn’t seem to bother thehunters. At such times one might wonder about the safety of being in the woods.Actually, it’s not that bad. Hunting accidents are rare in Arizona. There arethree times as many accidents between vehicles and elk along the Rim as thereare firearm-related hunting accidents in the entire state. These are mostlyself-inflicted, by shotgunners after game birds, and all but one in the lastfive years was nonfatal. In the entire U.S. there are almost no recordedaccidental shootings of people not accompanying the hunter. And in Arizona therehas never been a nonhunter even injured by firearms in the wild.I’m sure that responsible woodsmen exist. . . somewhere. Stories about hunterswho kill livestock and mistake other hunters for game are for the most part justthat, stories. But every season brings back those lunatics who shoot holes insigns and leave piles of broken glass bottles from their target-practicesessions. Every year there are those who leave their trash behind, even some whodrive home blissfully unconcerned about the campfires left blazing away back inthe woods.Anyone who thinks I am overstating the natural beauty of the forest obviouslyhas not been there. Even flowery words cannot recreate the clean, robust feelinga man can experience when he is surrounded by nature. You do not have to be adainty, daisy-sniffing poet to appreciate the green planet God gave us. As withany manual labor, at times, thinning can be a dreary, ass-busting, backbreaking,bone-weary grind. But my deep love for the fresh wildness of the forest is why Ichose to work there.One minor hazard we had to put up with is those damned buckthorn bushes, orbuckbrush. The tough, flexible stalks will not cut when a chainsaw hits them.Instead, they get caught on the chain and flip back at the worker with enoughforce to drive their long thorns through a heavy glove all the way to the bone.The scratches and punctures we received from those poisonous spines nearlyalways ached and drew blood, even when quite minor. Whenever we had to cut treesin a patch of that cursed brush, our legs and arms would start to feel likepincushions.Dwayne Smith wasn’t aware of it, but I had to be constantly careful to fell mytrees so as to miss him. His inexperience, or maybe overeagerness, was causinghim to work too close to me, instead of allowing a little accumulation of slashto put some distance between us. A couple of falling saplings bouncing off hisskull would knock a little vigilance into him if he wasn’t careful. But at leasthe was trying.I could not say the same for Steve. I could see Mike far back down the strip,restacking some sloppy piles to bring them up to specification. Steve tookadvantage of the boss’s absence to rest his can momentarily on a handy log. Hewas ordinarily a good worker, but was a little disgruntled today because Mikehad blamed him for some bad piles Dwayne had made.I was trying to keep my distance from the other men, but we were coming togetheron a thick place to one side of the piling strip. The noise of my own saw isloud enough, even with earplugs, without revving all three of them in one spot.Just then I saw a shadow and jumped barely in time to escape a falling tree.Damn! I looked to see who had cut it. Allen. His mocking grin let me know it wasno accident. I didn’t let on that he had needled me. I moved farther up thestrip to work. Even when accidental, falling trees were another good reason notto work too close to another man.Once, while thinning in a high wind, I heard a loud crack and looked up in timeto see a giant dead tree blotting out the sun as it fell toward me. Dead trees,or “snags,” as woodsmen call them, do not have a parachute of green limbs toslow their fall. The ancient bug-ridden tower fell so quickly I didn’t have timeto move. The brittle old tree landed in the midst of the crew with a cracklingroar, shattering into dozens of jagged sections. The thunderous force with whichit snapped off the smaller trees it fell on was enough to make a man need tochange his pants. After the dust cleared and we recovered from the shock, wemade a head count. We found everybody standing and in one piece.Allen always cuts like a crazy man. He would put his head down and slasheverything in his path, not looking where the trees fell. He was a faster sawyerthan anyone out there, even me. His speed helped acre-production, but it kepthim from being up to working every day. His uncontrollable temper was probablywhat made him saw like that, taking his anger out on the trees. Allen had nearlycome to blows with almost everyone on the crew, including me. He had a way ofpicking fights he never finished. Although our differences were forgotten as faras I was concerned, and we were friendly on the job, I suspected that Allenmight have one or two lingering bad feelings toward me.The afternoon sun was starting to cool as it began angling steeper down in thewest. In the mountains, sundown comes early. It gets dark very quickly when oldSol slips behind the trees and out of sight behind the high ridges. That lastpart of the day always seems to crawl by. The gathering chill was beginning tonumb my nose. We moved quickly in the late-afternoon nippiness. With summerending, it was starting to get down to five or ten degrees at night. Activityhelped me build up body heat inside my lightweight, blue denim jacket. I workeda little faster to ward off the chill, eagerly anticipating the reprieve of theday’s conclusion. Not long to go before we could head for home and a nice hotshower.Sunset had been fifteen minutes earlier, but we kept cutting in the waninglight. I checked my watch again. It was six o’clock at last! Mike was still downthe hill a little way, picking up and repiling. I yelled and took the liberty ofgiving the stop-work signal. The sound of the saws died; the final echoesabsorbed into the deepening dusk.“Time to go!” I announced loudly. The tired men were revitalized by the prospectof quitting for the day, and by their feelings of accomplishment. We had moved apretty good distance up the strip in those eight hours of labor.“Let’s go home!” John said enthusiastically.Allen grumbled, “It’s ’bout time.”“We really hurt ’em today, boys,” Ken exclaimed, rubbing his palms together withthe characteristic ambitious mannerism he used when he talked about work.“Hurt me, you mean!” Dwayne said, rubbing his lower back.“One of you guys wanna help me carry this stuff?” Steve asked, gathering up thenearly empty gas and oil cans. John grabbed the water jug and an oil can. Icarried the orange five-gallon plastic gas can in one hand and my saw in theother as we descended the hill.We loaded the chainsaws and gas and oil cans into the back of the truck. Afterarranging the gas cans so they would not tip over and leak on the bumps, Mikeslammed the tailgate tightly.“You guys have got to start doing a better job on those piles,” Mike said. “Thatmess I fixed up back there never would have passed inspection. I know who’smaking those mistakes by their position on the strip. So, not mentioning anynames, let’s tighten up on the specifications—all right?”Nobody said anything. He was right. If our cutting failed to pass inspection, itwould delay our payday until it did pass. It was in our interest to get it rightthe first time.“Listen to that,” Steve said. We could still hear the faint sound of shootingreverberating down the gullies somewhere in the distance. It is illegal to huntafter sundown, but there just aren’t enough game wardens to go around. Maybesomeone was doing a little target practice.“Let’s load up, men,” Mike said.The decrepit pickup groaned on its tired old suspension as everyone piled in.There was Dwayne by the left rear door, John and Steve in the middle, and Allenby the right rear door. In the front, I sat by the door, riding shotgun. Ken satin the middle, and of course Mike was driving. The seven of us usually sat inthe same place every day. Nonsmokers in front, smokers in back.“Home, James,” someone said, with mock elegance.Mike started the old pickup and we climbed north up the ridge toward the RimRoad. It was 6:10. Barring any breakdowns, we should be home before 7:30. Weleft the windows down so we could cool off some. We were still warm fromlaboring, in spite of the evening air. Mike, Ken, and I do not smoke and weprefer to inhale genuine, unadulterated air. The four in the backseat lit up assoon as we were in the truck, eager after hours without a cigarette. The freshair coming in my window was bracing. We usually nap on the way to work everymorning, but none of us ever feels drowsy on the way back to town. The rousingactivity on the job hones a keenness that stays with us all the way home.“Why don’t we all go swimming after dinner tonight?” I suggested.Dwayne, new to Snowflake, looked doubtful. “You guys are crazy, it’s too damncold for that.”“There’s a heated pool in town,” I told him. Snowflake was a small town of only2,500 then, but it actually had an indoor swimming pool.“That would be a good way to soak out some of the crud and tiredness I’mfeeling,” Mike agreed.“I’ll bring a basketball,” Ken volunteered.Bouncing over the thank-you-ma’ams, the truck kept bottoming out on its springswith a dull clunking sound. The fellows started cracking jokes about the pickup.“Peddle harder, everyone, we’ll make it up this hill yet,” Ken quipped.“Hey Mike, do you like this thing better than a pickup truck?” one of the mencalled from the backseat.The continual jouncing and bobbing of the vehicle, unencumbered with shockabsorbers, caused me to add: “What he’s got here is a rare specimen ofAustralian pogo truck!”Everybody laughed.Just then my eye was caught by a light coming through the trees on the right, ahundred yards ahead. I idly assumed that the glow was the sun going down in thewest. Then it occurred to me that the sun had set half an hour ago. Curious, Ithought it might be the light of some hunters camped there—headlights or maybe afire. Some of the guys must have caught sight of it too, because the men on theright side of the truck had fallen silent.As we continued driving up the road toward the brightness, we passed in sight ofit for an instant. We barely got a glimpse through gnarled branches before werolled past the opening in the trees.“Son of a . . Allen started.“What the hell was that?” I asked.My eyes strained to make sense of the glimmering through the dense stand oftrees blocking our vision. From my open window, I could see the yellowishbrilliance washing across our path onto the road another forty yards ahead.Intrigued, I was impatient to get past the intervening pines.“Hurry up! Drive on up there where we can see!” somebody urged.From the driver’s seat, Mike could not look up with the proper angle withoutleaning way over. “What do you guys see?” he demanded curiously.Dwayne answered, “I don’t know—but it looked like a crashed plane hanging in atree!”Finally, our growing excitement spurred Mike into wringing out what little speedthe pickup could still achieve on the incline. We rolled past the interveningevergreen thicket to where we could have an unobstructed view of the source ofthe strange radiance. Suddenly we were electrified by the most awesome,incredible sight we had seen in our entire lives.“Stop!” John cried out. “Stop the truck!”As the truck skidded to a dusty halt in the rocky road, I threw open the doorfor a clearer view of the dazzling sight.“My God!” Allen yelled. “It’s a flying saucer!”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3Abduction!Just as yellow gold is tested by the fire, so is friendship to be tested byadversity.—OvidMike shut off the engine. We watched, spellbound. The men on the left side ofthe truck leaned over so that they could see. There, a mere ninety feet abovethe ground, a strange, golden disc hovered silently. Our attention was rivetedon that object poised in the air. Impaled by the sight, we were held transfixedfor one long, silent moment that felt like an eternity.The cold, jarring reality of what we were witnessing struck fear and awe to thecore of every one of us. Suddenly beholding its vivid, magnificent structuresummoned all emotions at once. You could almost hear our hearts pounding abovethat suspended instant of silence. Less than thirty yards away, the metalliccraft hung motionless, fifteen feet above a tangled pile of logging slash.The craft was stationary, hovering well below the treetops near the crest of theridge. The hard, mechanical precision of the luminous vehicle was in sharpcontrast to the primitive ruggedness of the dark surroundings. Its edges wereclearly defined. The golden machine was starkly outlined against the deepeningblue of the clear evening sky.The soft yellow haze from the craft dimly illuminated the immediate area with aneerie glow. Under the weird light, the encircling forest took on bizarre huesthat were very different from its natural colors. The trees, the brush, and thegrass all reflected subtle, peculiar new shades.I estimated the object to have an overall diameter of fifteen or twenty feet; itwas eight or ten feet thick. The flattened disc had a shape like that of twogigantic pie-pans placed lip to lip, with a small round bowl turned upside downon top. Barely visible at our angle of sight, the white dome peaked over theupper outline of the ship. We could see darker stripes of a dull silver sheenthat divided the glowing areas into panel-like sections. The dim yellowish lightgiven off by the surface had the luster of hot metal, fresh from a blastfurnace.There were no visible antennae or protrusions of any kind. Nothing thatresembled a hatch, ports, or windowlike structures could be seen. There was nomotion and no sound from the craft. It almost appeared to be dead in the air.There was no life visible anywhere. Nothing stirred. It seemed that even thewind held its breath. The entire scene—we the work crew, the pickup, and thespectacular intruder—seemed frozen for a single instant.Ken shattered the silence. “Damnation! This is . . . really . . . happening!” hebreathed hoarsely, in a voice fraught with awestruck fear.Those words abruptly shook us from our reverie. No more than a second had passedsince I had thrown open the door as the truck stopped. I glanced from one toanother stricken face. Allen was hiding down low behind the doorsill. As Dwaynelater expressed it: “He kissed his knees.” Turning back to that impellingspectacle in the air, I was suddenly seized with the urgency to see the craft atclose range. I was afraid it would fly away and I would miss the chance of alifetime to satisfy my curiosity about it. I hurriedly got out of the truck andstarted toward the hovering ship.The men were alarmed by my sudden action.“Travis!” Allen called, low.“What do you think you’re doing?” Mike demanded in a loud, harsh whisper.Placing my feet quietly, I quickly stalked closer to the mysterious vehicle.Stepping over a low-leaning fir sapling, I carefully picked my way through theopening in the trees. I put my hands in my pockets in response to the coolertwilight air outside the truck.After I had traversed about fifteen or twenty yards, the men began urgentlycalling to me, in strained, hushed shouts, to return to the truck.“Travis!”“Hey, Travis!” the men warned insistently.“Get back here, man!” one of the men called in a louder voice.I stopped walking for a long, hesitant moment. I paused and turned to look backat the six men staring questioningly at me from the truck. The sober realizationof what I was doing abruptly heightened the doubt I was already wrestling with.What should I do? I asked myself. Maybe I’m being foolhardy, I told myself. Iwon’t get too close . . . but what if there’s somebody inside that thing? Ifaltered. Finally I reassured myself with: I can always run away.I was committed. Without replying to the guys, I resolutely turned and continuedmy brazen approach.“That crazy son of a bitch!” I heard someone swear.I moved more slowly, cautiously covering the remaining distance in a halfcrouch.I straightened up as I entered the dim circular halo of light softly reflectingonto the ground under the craft. I was about six feet from being directlybeneath the machine. Bathed in the yellow aura, I stared up at the unbelievablysmooth, unblemished surface of the curving hull. I was filled with a tremendoussense of awe and curiosity as I pondered the incomprehensible mysteries possiblewithin it.I had become aware of a barely audible sound coming from the ship. I coulddetect a strange blend of low- and high-pitched mechanical sounds. There wereintermittent high, piercing, beeping points overlaid on the distant, lowrumbling sound of heavy machinery. The strange tones were so mixed that it wasimpossible to compare them to any sound I could remember ever hearing.“Travis! Get away from there!” Mike yelled to me.I shot a fleeting look at the pickup parked in the road, then turned myattention back to studying the incredible ship.Suddenly I was startled by a powerful, thunderous swell in the volume of thevibrations from the craft. I jumped at the sound, like that of a multitude ofturbine generators starting up. I saw the saucer start wobbling on its axis witha quickening motion, in a pattern like the erratic spin of an unstabilized top.The same side continued to face me as the craft remained hovering atapproximately the same height while it wobbled.I ducked into a crouch, down behind the safety of a nearby log. I expected thesaucer to streak away. It didn’t. Cringing there, I did some fast reassessmentsof my situation. I resolved to waste no time in getting the hell out of there!I rose to go and was half out of my crouch when a tremendously bright,blue-green ray shot from the bottom of the craft. I saw and heard nothing. All Ifelt was the numbing force of a blow that felt like a high-voltageelectrocution. The intense bolt made a sharp cracking, or popping, sound. Thestunning concussion of the foot-wide beam struck me full in the head and chest.My mind sank quickly into unfeeling blackness. I didn’t even see what hit me;but from the instant I felt that paralyzing blow, I did not see, hear, or feelanything more.The men in the truck saw my body arch backward, arms and legs outstretched, asthe force of the blow lifted me off the ground. I was hurled backward throughthe air ten feet. They saw my right shoulder hit the hard rocky earth of theridgetop. My body landed limply and lay motionless, spread out on the ground.“It got him!” Steve yelled.Dwayne screamed: “Let’s get out of here!”“Get this son of a bitch moving!” Allen shrieked hysterically.Mike did not need to be asked. He was already desperately groping, fumblingaround for the ignition switch. His shaking fingers finally seized the key. Theengine roared to life. He popped out the clutch and the truck lunged forward.The knobby mud-and-snow tires flung rocks and clouds of dirt backward as theInternational spun out of the clearing. Mike gunned the truck up theboulder-strewn track. He frantically spun the steering wheel one way, then theother, navigating the tortuous road.“Is it following us?” he yelled over his shoulder. Nobody answered.“Is it after us?” he shouted again.When again no reply came, he turned to see the looks of stupefied shock on thefaces of his crew. Their pale faces stared straight ahead, blankly. He knew thenthat it was entirely up to him to get them all to safety.In reaction to the unbelievable horror of what they had witnessed, six hardenedwoodsmen were reduced to mindless terror. The truck bounced wildly in theirpanicked flight. It scraped loudly over the rocky water-bars. Mike sent thepickup careening off the road, crashing over bushes and small trees. He turnedaround to find the truck heading toward the thick trunk of a big pine tree. Hejerked the machine back onto the track in a spray of dirt and gravel.Mike was fearful that the saucer was pursuing them. He put his head out the openwindow to try to see behind and was stung in the face by the sharp pine needlesof a passing limb. He kept hitting boulders and other obstacles in his attemptsto look behind. The erratically vibrating rearview mirrors only produced ablurred, flickering image, a faint yellow glow in the blackness. Goaded by asurge of terror, he stomped on the gas pedal.The rattling truck shot forward at thirty-five miles an hour—far too fast forthe condition of that road. A passing limb slammed into the right rearviewmirror, bending it uselessly to the side of the truck. The old Internationalwent flying through the air over the dirt ramp of a high water-bar. As itlanded, the pickup smashed down destructively on its weakened springs with aterrible crash.The powerful jolt of metal on metal brought Mike to his senses. He was grippedby a sudden icy realization. If the truck broke down, they would be stranded andat the mercy of the unknown threat they were fleeing. He slowed the truck downto ten miles an hour. He was grateful to find the truck still working, capableof carrying them away.The road turned east in a tight curve to the left. The men remained petrified instunned silence. Mike was still badly frightened, and apprehensive of beingpursued. He looked north, back across the curve of the road, and saw thestartling glow of the saucer in the gathering darkness. It was still barelyvisible in the same clearing, two hundred yards back. He was very much relievedto find that their mad dash had put some distance between them and it.The truck passed behind dense thickets of pine saplings, and the ship was oncemore lost from sight. In diverting his attention from his driving, Mike made thewrong approach to a water-bar in the road. It was the largest of thethank-you-ma’ams and the last one before the Rim Road, a hundred feet fartheron. Unless that water-bar was crossed at the correct angle, the pickup wouldhigh-center and get stuck straddling the hump. Mike stopped the truck to back upand make another run at it.“It doesn’t look like it’s after us,” Mike shuddered as he shoved the gearshiftinto reverse.The pause broke the men out of their shocked silence. They began to jabberhysterically. Instead of continuing on over the obstacle, they sat there withthe engine running. They struggled to collect themselves and decide what to do.Everyone was yelling at once, in a confusion of high-pitched shouting. Allenuttered a loud string of profanity. They were all either crying, praying, orswearing. Some did all three. Steve was sobbing out a prayer, his young facestreaming with tears.Ken stammered, “I c-can’t believe wh-what I just saw!”Dwayne said in a wondering voice: “I’ve never seen a UFO before!”“It l-looked like it k-k-killed him!” Allen stuttered.Ken shook his head. “That poor guy!”Mike anxiously asked: “I saw him falling back, but what happened to him?” “Man,a blue ray just shot out of the bottom of that thing and hit him all over! Itjust seemed to engulf him.” Ken’s voice was solemn with awe.“Good hell! It looked like he disintegrated!” Dwayne exclaimed.“No, he was in one piece,” Steve contradicted. “I saw him hit the ground.”“I do know one thing. It sure looked like he got hit by lightning or something!”Dwayne returned. “I heard a zap—like as if he touched a live wire!” “Damn!” Johnswore. “It sure knocked the hell out of him!”“It looked almost like a grenade exploded in front of him and just blew himback!” Ken cried.“Hey, men, we better go back!” someone said.Ken agreed. “Yeah, he could be hurt real bad!”“No way, man. I ain’t going back there!” Steve said.Dwayne said, “No, we better go back. He could really need help!” He looked atSteve. “You don’t want to stay here by yourself while we go, do you?”Steve gave him a blank stare.“I don’t know if I want to go back, either!” John admitted.“It’s startin’ to get dark, maybe we better go get some help,” Allen faltered.“All right,” Mike interjected. “Let’s build a fire so the guys who don’t want togo can stay here in the clearing while the rest of us go back there.”Primitive instinct made the false security of a fire seem somehow comforting.Mike shut off the engine and they all got out into the deepening dusk. Theirhoarse yelling grew louder and more hysterical when they got out. They keptlooking around nervously, up into the darkening sky. Mike went to the back ofthe truck to get gas to splash on some wood for a quick fire. The men followed.They aimed most of their ideas and questions about what they should do at him.Even though Mike did not insist on being bossy at work, they automaticallyturned to him to tell them what to do. Their diminished self-possession causedthem to depend on Mike for answers he did not have.Just as Mike was about to get the gas out of the back, they were startled by thesudden approach of headlights coming west on the Rim Road. The dim outline of acamper-pickup could be seen passing in the dark.“Let’s go catch that pickup and get help!” John yelped excitedly.“We can’t catch that guy,” Mike said, dispirited. “He’s long gone by now—butmaybe he’ll stop up the road somewhere,” he added, brightening a little. “If wecan’t catch him, maybe we can find some other hunters or somebody.”“Yeah, let’s go!” Dwayne agreed.Everybody piled in the right side of the truck, Dwayne this time taking therecently vacated front seat, by the door. As Mike went around the driver’s sideof the truck, he exclaimed: “Look! Did you see that?”The men scrambled to look. One of the men ran to the front of the pickup. “Whatwas it?” he asked.Mike told them he thought he had briefly seen the outline of the golden discthrough the trees to the south. It had raised itself vertically to treetop leveland streaked away toward the northeast at incredible speed.They got in the truck, Mike pondering the unbelievable acceleration of thatstreak he had glimpsed. He angled the forgiving old pickup over the highwater-bar and pulled out onto the Rim Road, heading west. He drove rapidly, halfhoping to catch up with the camper that had passed.“What do you guys think we should do?” Mike asked.“I think we ought to go back!” Ken said vehemently.Allen disagreed. “We oughta get some help—get some guns from some hunters orsomebody—before we try that.”“I’ll go if we can stay in the truck,” Steve whined. “I don’t want to get out.”“I guess we better go back,” John said solemnly. He hadn’t said much at alluntil now. He appeared still to be in a mild state of shock.They argued on, rehashing what had happened. They did not find any hunters, oranyone else. They were still arguing a mile down the road, where they reachedthe turnoff that went north to Heber from the Rim Road. There, they finallyworked their way around to the inevitable conclusion.“Ken, do you think it’s safe to go back and see about Travis?” Mike asked.“That’s what I’ve been saying we should do all along! He could be bleeding todeath! Maybe he was only knocked down by that thing. We don’t know. We ought toat least go back and check!”Mike turned the truck around at the turnoff. He said firmly: “This truck isgoing back. Anybody who doesn’t want to come can get out right here and now, andwait! We’ve been acting like a bunch of cowards. We’re all scared, there’s nodenying that, but we’ve got to do what we should’ve done in the first place!”The embarrassed men no longer protested returning to the site. Even if any werestill reluctant, they were ashamed to say so. Also, the prospect of waitingalone at the turnoff in the dark was much worse than going back together.Their courage had been reinforced by the time and distance away from the site.However, as they turned left, off the Rim Road toward the original scene, theirapprehension began steadily to rebuild. They could not stop going over and overwhat they had seen. They began speculating on the dreadful possibilities of whatthey might find when they returned. The nearer they got, the more anxious theybecame.“What if that thing is still there?” Dwayne questioned fearfully.“We’ll be able to see it before we get there,” Mike said uncertainly. “If it isstill there, we’ll turn around and get the hell out of there.”“What if we find Travis’s dead body lying out there?” was Allen’s grislyquestion.Nobody replied—nobody wanted to think about the answer to that.They rounded the curve where Mike had last been able to see the saucer.They saw nothing. The pickup rolled hesitantly onward. Skittishly the men lookedall about them. They quieted their motions inside the truck. Their subduedcomments came less frequently.“Get the flashlight out of the glove box, there,” Mike directed. Dwayne handedit to him.“I think it was right along here somewhere, you guys, so keep your eyes peeled.”Mike drove on slowly, scanning the roadside.“Hold it! It was right back there!” Ken exclaimed.“Yeah! I think it was right about here!” Dwayne agreed. “I recognize that pileof slash over there!”Mike sent the flashlight beam stabbing out into the darkness. He called loudly,“TRAVIS . . . !” Everybody listened intently. No answer.Somebody suggested pulling the truck around and pointing the headlights towardthe log pile above which they had seen the hovering ship. They backed up andpulled in, driving over the fir sapling leaning in the way. Their eyes searchedthe area illuminated by the headlights.They found nothing. No dead body in the clearing.“Maybe this ain’t it,” Ken suggested. “All these piles look alike.”“I thought it was farther down that way,” Allen said, pointing north down theridge.“Naw, if anything, it was farther back up that way,” Ken countered.“No, I remember this spot,” Dwayne insisted. “See that tree leanin’ down overthere?”“We’re just going to have to get out and look around,” Mike cut in. “Before wedo anything—who all’s coming and who all is staying?”Nobody wanted to remain behind alone. The woods were very dark.“Leave it running,” Steve suggested, as they got out of the truck. They left thedoors open, too—everyone saw the sense of a quick getaway. Just in case.They searched first in the security of the headlights. Everybody stayedtogether, huddling close behind Mike, who carried the only flashlight.The tightly-knit group searched the immediate area thoroughly, foot by foot. Theflashlight beam probed into the night, examining every dark shape. They searchedbehind every log, bush, and stump. They called repeatedly: “Travis! . . .TRAVIS!!” Except for their calls, the woods were deathly quiet.Their eyes strained into the dark of the surrounding trees. They cast occasionalapprehensive glances skyward. There was nothing but empty, star-dusted sky.Their frayed nerves were strained to the snapping point.“Look out!” Dwayne cried, jumping.Everyone jerked their heads this way and that, looking around them. “What’s thematter?” the others asked urgently.“Ohhh!” Dwayne heaved a relieved sigh. “That moon up there scared the hell outof me!” There had been a new moon the previous Monday, which had grown tonightto a thin, golden sliver only a little lighter in color than the flying saucer.“I caught it out of the corner of my eye and I thought it was that flying saucercoming back!” The adrenaline that had surged into everyone’s bloodstream leftthem shaking uncontrollably.Occasionally catching unexpected glimpses of the moon, and anticipating at anymoment the discovery of a charred corpse increased every man’s gut fear. Theybecame more and more nervous as they searched.“TRAVIS!” they called at intervals.They looked farther north, as Allen had suggested, but there were no moreslash-piles there. Also, the ground was steeper than they remembered the sitebeing. They searched beyond the crest of the ridge and farther south, wherethere were more piles. None of the piles looked as much like what theyremembered as the first one they had investigated.“Maybe he ran after us when we took off!” Ken suggested. They searched fortracks in the soft, powdery dust of the road. There were no tracks but those ofthe truck. Looking in the trees on the steeply sloping ground east of the road,the men again found nothing.They found no sign anywhere—no foreign objects or unusual markings. No burns,pad impressions, or disturbed ground. Not a trace of tracks and no evidence of astruggle.“TRAVIS!”The longer they continued, the more worried Mike became, more overcome withemotion. He stumbled, then stood, looking down, struggling to control hisfeelings. The loss of his friend, his guilt at driving away, and the pressure ofthe leadership being demanded of him all became too much to bear for a moment.He silently handed the flashlight to Ken.“You all right, Mike?” Ken took him by the shoulder. “Take it easy, man. Comeon, it’s going to be okay.”After a few moments, Mike managed to regain his composure. Finally he couldspeak: “Okay, you guys, we’re not doing any good here. Let’s go!”They got in the truck and began the long drive back to Heber. The farther theygot from the spot, the more relieved they grew. Speeding slightly, they drove asfast as road conditions would permit. The memory of what they had so recentlywitnessed left them with a spectrum of strong emotional reactions.“That ray was the brightest thing I’ve ever seen in my whole life!” declaredSteve. “It almost blinded me for a second.”“You’re never gonna catch me out here in these woods again!” vowed Dwayne.Ken kept shaking his head. “Incredible, absolutely incredible,” he ponderedaloud.Behind their excited talking, the men were nagged by the problem they knew theywould have to face.“What are we going to do now?” somebody finally asked.“Let’s get a buncha people together to go out there and help us look,” Dwaynesuggested.Then Ken voiced the one thought they had all avoided so far. “We’re gonna haveto tell the authorities about this.”“The cops?” Allen exclaimed. “No way! They’ll think we’re nuts!”“If we don’t tell them, and if Travis can’t be found, they might suspect us, ”Mike pointed out.“If we tell anybody at all, they’re gonna think we’re crazy!” Steve said.“I know!” John said, brightening. “We’ll just say that Travis is lost, and notsay anything about the UFO.”“He might well only be dazed and wandering around out there . . . but what ifhe’s not?” Mike questioned ominously. The possibility of what else incrediblemight have happened that this question opened up, was one thing they did notwant to think about.“We’d better tell them everything and just pray that they believe us!” said Ken.“We’ve got to stay honest all the way through this. It’s the only way we’regoing to be believed.”Just then the pickup rounded the bend. The comforting lights of Heber came intoview. The oasis of civilization was the very symbol of salvation to them at thatmoment. They drove down the dark, quiet street of the sleeping town to thenearest telephone. The pale blue fluorescent light of that phone booth was awelcome sight.They parked the truck and got out. Ken picked up the cold black receiver anddialed 0. It was he who first broke the incredible news to the police."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4Night SearchEven the bravest are frightened by sudden terrors.—Tacitus, 87 A.D.Ken Peterson waited nervously for an operator to answer. He glanced at hiswatch. It was 7:35 p.m. He looked out the window, his breath fogging the coldglass. Just outside the booth, Mike and Allen were pacing up and down,occasionally casting anxious glances at him. They stamped their feet to ward offthe creeping numbness of the cold November night. The others sat in the warmtruck. All five men waited tensely while Ken talked.“Well?” Allen said, as Ken stepped out of the telephone booth.“He’s coming,” Ken announced.“Who’s coming?” Mike asked. “The sheriff?”“No—Deputy Ellison,” Ken replied. “He wants us to meet him up there.” He pointedtoward a parking lot a block up the street by the highway. “What did you tellhim?” Mike asked impatiently.“Nothing,” Ken answered. “I mean, at the last minute I got to thinking. If I wasto tell him about the UFO on the phone, he might’ve thought it was a crazy jokeor something and hung up on me.” They started toward the pickup. “I just toldhim one of our crew got lost,” he finished lamely.The heater’s noisy fan was blowing lukewarm air into the truck. Theirs was theonly vehicle in the freshly paved parking lot. They did not talk much. Theexcitement had diminished into the numb silence of shock.While they waited for Deputy Ellison, they struggled to think of a way topresent their incredible report.“You know,” Dwayne said discouragingly, “it’s gonna be awful hard for him toaccept. We’re gonna hafta expect that.”“Hell no, he ain’t gonna believe us,” Allen grumbled. “The pigs never believeanything.”This derogatory term for the authorities bothered the other men.“Here we are, asking them for help,” Ken reproached him, “and you sit heretalking about them like that.”Allen ignored their disapproval.“They’ve gotta know we’re telling the truth,” John insisted. “I sure don’t knowwhat the hell we’re gonna do if they don’t.”“Well, we’re about to find out,” Mike said grimly. “Here he is.”The shiny brown county car was pulling into the parking lot. It rolled up to thedriver’s side of the truck and stopped. The big deputy stepped out and saunteredaround the car. Passing in front of the headlights, he sent long, shiftingshadows out across the deserted highway.Mike rolled down his window as the officer stepped up. He stood about five-ten,a strong two hundred pounds. He wore the brown, western-style uniform of theNavajo County Sheriff s Department. On the lapel of his heavy coat glinted thegolden star of his badge.“Okay, what’s the problem here?” he demanded. There was a tone in his voice thatmade them certain he would not believe a single word of what they were about tosay.“Well,” Mike began. “A friend of ours is probably lost. At least he might belost, anyway. I mean, he may be dead!”Ellison’s interest sharpened. His eyes darted from one face to the other.Steve’s reddened eyes and tear-streaked face, the various pale, taut expressionsof the others, made him certain of at least one thing. Something very serioushad happened.“What do you mean, ‘He might be dead’? You’ll have to be a little more specificthan that,” the deputy said with stern authority. “What makes you think he mightbe dead?”“Well, sir . . .” Mike groped for words. “It’s kinda hard to explain. You maythink we’re ... I mean ... I don’t really know where to start!”“How about starting at the beginning?” Ellison ordered impatiently. Ken came toMike’s rescue. He began relating what had happened. Ken’s words were like a leakspringing in a dam. The others joined in, adding more information and agreeingwith Ken’s descriptions. The impact of their recent experience was fresh ineveryone’s speech. Their voices broke at the recall of their nightmarish ordeal.Emotions overflowed at the first opportunity to tell someone who had not seenwhat they had seen. The dam obliterated, their words washed over Ellison like aflood tide.The deputy exhibited exceptional cool and reserve. He did not interrupt the menthe first time through the account. While they talked, Ellison studied each facewith narrowed eyes. The longer the men talked, the more his attitude seemed tochange. What it was changing to, the men couldn’t be certain.Finally, when they finished, Ken confronted the officer with what everyoneconsidered obvious. “You don’t believe us, do you?” he asked fatalistically. Helooked Ellison squarely in the eye.Surprised, Ellison replied: “No, I wouldn’t say I don’t believe you, thoughyou’ve got to admit it sounds pretty wild.”The men were relieved that the deputy was taking them seriously. But that hadonly been a secondary source of their apprehension. The fate of their coworkerwas their prime concern.The deputy continued. “No, I believe you enough to where I’m going to call inand get some deputies out here to look for this man. I want some of you to comeup on the hill with me. I’ve got to radio in to the central office in Holbrook.Yes, you three,” he said, nodding at Mike, Ken, and Allen—the more vocal half ofthe group. The other three men were still claimed by stunned silence for themost part. “The rest of you wait here,” he ordered.The three got in the police car with Ellison and rode the winding mile west onHighway 277 to the top of the hill. The radio did not have the power to transmitout of the canyon cradling Heber. Up on the hill, the deputy had a clearer shotat Holbrook, the county seat. Ellison radioed the dispatcher. He was informedthat the sheriff was not in the office but would radio back.While Ellison waited for his superior to return his radio call, he had thedispatcher connect him with County Deputy Glen Flake. He asked Deputy Flake tocheck at my home to see if I was there. He thought it was possible that I hadsomehow caught a ride into town after the others had left me behind. Ellison didnot explain the request. But Deputy Flake reported back in a few minutes thatthere were no lights on, the house was locked up; no one was home.Finally Sheriff Marlin Gillespie came on the radio. Ellison told him that he hada missing-person’s report involving a UFO. He briefly related what he’d beentold. Gillespie said he would come out immediately. Ellison explained therewould be bad road conditions. Sheriff Gillespie responded that he andUndersheriff Ken Coplan would bring the Sheriff s Department’s four-wheel-drivepickup.After Sheriff Gillespie signed off, Deputy Glen Flake came back on the radio toask: “What was that I heard about Travis Walton and a UFO?” He inquired whetherany more men were needed. Ellison told him that it was best not to talk aboutthe matter over the air until they had checked into it further.They did not want to start a panic with any wild rumor. Deputy Flake agreed, butsaid he would stand by.Deputy Ellison drove the three men back to the parking lot where the other threemen had remained. They all waited for Sheriff Gillespie to travel the forty-fivemiles from Holbrook.An hour later, Sheriff Gillespie and his second-in-command, Undersheriff Coplan,arrived in the county’s four-wheel-drive pickup. The camper-truck was a bigmachine with at least a foot and a half of ground clearance. Ken Coplan got outand strolled over to where Ellison was questioning Ken Peterson, off to oneside. Coplan was a big grizzly, even compared to the sizable Ellison. However,the truly commanding figure was Sheriff Gillespie. His character more thancompensated for his smaller frame. He approached Mike’s window. Thewell-seasoned sheriff's eighteen years in law enforcement had left little to besurprised about, but this was a new one.Gillespie addressed the group in a congenial manner that smoothed over thetough, serious undercurrent in his voice. “Tell me again, who is this fellathat’s missing?”Mike took a deep breath, looked at the sheriff squarely and answered, “One ofour crew, Travis Walton.” He paused, looking for some sign of how the sheriffwas going to take what he was about to say.With no change of expression the sheriff prompted, “Well, let’s hear it from thestart. What happened?”The lawman listened carefully while the men explained. His sun-weathered Irishcomplexion wrinkled into a hard, inscrutable expression as he studied the men.He immediately noted the absence of any symptom of intoxication among them.“It’s colder than hell out here,” he said. “Mind if I get in there a minutewhile I ask you a few questions?” Gillespie walked around the truck and sat inthe right front seat. He continued to question the men intently.At length he shook his head. “You know, this whole thing sounds crazy, but I’vegot to admit—I’ve not seen anything to give me a reason to disbelieve you!”Faith was restored for the crewmen. They were now sure that they had done theright thing in telling the truth and reporting their problem.The sheriff had run into every sort of crackpot and con artist in his years as alaw officer. By now he had a good feel for deception. None was apparent here.These men were sincere. And he knew—if he had ever seen it—that this wasauthentic shock on their faces.The existence of UFOs was not so unheard-of to the lawman. He related to them anincident he had experienced years ago in this same county.The men were amazed to learn that Sheriff Marlin Gillespie himself hadexperienced a close encounter with a large glowing object!“Okay, we’ve got to go out and see if we can find this guy,” the sheriffconcluded. “If this fellow is hurt, we need to find him as soon as possible.”“I ain’t going back out there!” Steve declared emphatically. “No way.” He wasfilled with dread at the prospect. The trauma of recent events had followed along exhausting workday. John and Dwayne were equally firm in their resolutionnot to return to the forest.“At least some of you are going to have to come along,” Gillespie insisted.Ken, Allen, and Mike agreed to accompany the lawmen back to the site of theencounter. Mike gave John permission to drive Steve and Dwayne home to Snowflakein the crew truck.The three remaining men got into Deputy Ellison’s car. Ken got in front andAllen and Mike climbed in the rear.Gillespie drove down and got the owner of the Union 76 station out of bed. Theyfilled the tanks of Deputy Ellison’s car and the four-wheel-drive pickup, thenheaded up the dirt canyon road toward Turkey Springs. Ellison led the way withthe directions supplied by the three tree-cutters. Gillespie and Coplan broughtup the rear in the pickup.The county car was designed for streets and highways, so the fifteen miles ofrough dirt road were a little too much for it. In driving up the last steep hillbefore reaching the Rim Road, the muffler fell completely off the car. Ellisongot out and put the muffler in the back of the pickup following. The car roarednoisily on up the hill with the truck still behind.When they reached the turnoff from the Rim Road to the contract, Ellison’s carcould go no farther. The thank-you-ma’ams were too high for its low groundclearance. Ellison, Allen, and Ken then climbed into the paddywagon-style camperon the back of the pickup. They sat on the two hard wooden benches of the“rolling cell” for the last quarter mile of the dark forest trail.Mike rode in the front seat of the pickup with Sheriff Gillespie and Ken Coplan.The golden sliver of the moon which had earlier loomed in the western sky, haddropped below the horizon. It was pitch-dark. Gillespie shone the powerful beamof the truck’s spotlight to the sides of the road as they drove.As they neared the abduction site, everyone, including the officers, could nothelp feeling a bit uneasy. No one spoke. Only the sound of the engine and thetires scattering rocks could be heard as they broke into the clearing.Mike said softly, “This is the place.” The truck rolled to a stop. Coplan sentthe spotlight scanning back and forth around the empty clearing. They slowly gotout and stood in a circle in front of the headlights. Compulsively they allturned their eyes skyward. The woods were quiet. The ephemeral streak of a smallmeteorite silently crossed the star-studded void.Gillespie cleared his throat. “Wounded animals usually travel downhill,” hesaid. He discussed the possibility that I was hurt and had wandered away in thedark, perhaps delirious. It was likely that if I still had my senses about me, Iwould stay on the roads where help could find me. If I was very badly hurt, thechances were good that I had not gotten far.They looked around with apprehension at the dark surrounding trees. With thetemperature steadily lowering, they all desperately hoped they would find somesign of me soon.“Ellison, you and Rogers take the truck and search the roads down below,” thesheriff ordered. “The rest of us will use the flashlights and look around here.”The contract was riddled with old logging trails normally impassable with anordinary vehicle. The big four-wheeler ambled over one rugged trail afteranother. Coplan sent the spotlight bouncing from left to right, the narrow shaftsweeping the roadsides. Mike and the deputy, an experienced tracker, kept aconstant vigil for footprints. They stopped at intervals to check the dusty roadfor signs. There was no wind; any creature passing over that soft ground wouldleave distinct tracks. For another endless, bitter-cold hour, both partiescontinued to search without success. Not a single trace of anyone was found. Thetwo groups gathered back at the clearing to exchange the grim news.“I think we’ve done about all we can do here tonight,” Gillespie announced. Hisstatement gave the men a sinking feeling that they were afraid to put intowords. Their thoughts were that if I was in the immediate area, they would havefound me. I should have heard their calls if I was anywhere near. Unless I waslying unconscious in the nearby brush. Or perhaps I had simply started runningand kept running until I collapsed. The chances of dying from exposure at thistime of year were great. I had only a light jacket. I might also die from myinjuries if I needed medical attention.“We can only cover so much ground in the dark with the number of men we have,”the sheriff continued. “I’m going to get more men out here first thing in themorning. We’ll blanket the whole area. Right now we need to notify Walton’sfamily. Who’s his next of kin?”“His mother, Mary Kellett,” Mike replied. “She’s staying in a cabin over east ofOvergaard. Bear Springs is the place.”“Okay,” Gillespie said. “You go with Coplan in the truck and notify Walton’smother. Ellison and I will take Dalis and Peterson back to Snowflake.”During the half-hour drive, Coplan remarked: “This whole thing sounds crazy ashell! If I didn’t know Ken Peterson for so long, I’d have a heck of a timebelievin’ the rest of you.” He explained that he had gone to school with KenPeterson’s father and had known the family for years. “Ken just wouldn’t lieabout something like this,” he said in conclusion.It was shortly after one in the morning when they made the turn onto the lasteighth of a mile to the house. It stood on the edge of a wide forest meadow andwas overhung by grand old oaks.Mom heard her lop-eared old hound dog start barking furiously as the pickupswung into the yard. She awoke and rushed to the window to see who could bearriving at her remote cabin at that hour. The truck pulled up and pointed itslights at the house. She could not recognize the vehicle through the blindingglare. She grabbed up her trusty Winchester from the corner. A woman alone couldnot be too careful.The two men mounted the steps to the front porch. Mike felt weighed down by theresponsibility of telling my mother what had happened to her son. He knew shewas strong enough to have raised six children all by herself. He had seen herbrave some pretty hard times in the eight years he had known our family. She wascertainly a woman independent enough to spend her summers alone in this remotecabin. Not the sort of person to fly to pieces. But, under the circumstances, hedid not know quite how she would take the news.“That’s far enough!” Mom said. She peered at them over the sight of the riflebarrel thrust through the partially opened door. Then, identifying Mike, shelowered the gun a little.“Who’s that with you?” she demanded.She remained cautious until the man stepped out into the headlights of thetruck. The man introduced himself as Navajo County Undersheriff Ken Coplan. Atthe sight of his badge her heart sank. She knew that something must be terriblywrong. This late-night visit could only mean one thing. She lowered the guncompletely.“What’s wrong, Mike?” she asked, bracing herself for the worst.“Could we come in and talk to you?” Mike began slowly.“Who got hurt?” she asked, her voice rising slightly.“Well, nobody got hurt, exactly. . . .” Mike tried to break it to her easily.“Have you seen your son tonight, ma’am?” Coplan interjected. The officer knew itwould have been impossible for me to find my way there on foot over those milesof rugged terrain, especially if I were in a dazed or injured condition. He wasattempting to bring up the subject in a neutral manner.“There’s something wrong with Travis, then, isn’t there?” she exclaimed. “Mike,he wouldn’t bring you here if it wasn’t Travis!”“Well, we don’t know if he’s hurt. As far as we know he’s just lost, but it’s along story, so let me explain,” Mike began, as gently as he could.Mom was struck by the look on Mike’s face. She had never seen him look so badlyupset. It made her very worried about what he had to tell her. She did not askany more questions. She opened the door wide and asked them to come in and sitdown. She leaned the rifle in a corner and went to put a robe on over the bigflannel men’s pajamas she wore on those cold mountain nights. The men gropedtheir way into the darkened living room and found the couch.She came back with a Coleman gas lantern. She threw a chunk of oak onto thedying embers in the old iron woodstove. They sat there in the dim light comingin the window from the pickup, while Mike began to break it to her, speakingwith difficulty, groping for words that would not overly alarm her.She managed to hold on to her composure on the surface, but while he talked, shecontinued vigorously pumping the handle of the lantern long after it was readyto be lit.Mike broke from his narrative to suggest politely, “Uh, don’t you think that’sabout enough?”“Oh, yes. I guess so,” she said, embarrassed. She struck a big stick-match andlit the lantern.When Mike finished his incredible report, she asked him to repeat it, as thoughshe could not quite grasp what he was saying. After he repeated the story, sheasked the deputy: “Is this true?”“I guess so, ma’am; we’ve been out there looking for him tonight,” Coplanaffirmed.Then she threw Mike a hard look. “Do you mean to sit here and tell me that youjust drove off and left him? You didn’t try to help him?”Mike looked away in shame. “Yeah,” he admitted. “But when we saw what happened,we panicked . . . we just panicked! We thought it was after us, too! What elsecould we do? We did go back right away and look for him.“We’re going to resume the search at daybreak, Mrs. Kellett,” Coplaninterrupted. “We’ll have search parties out there first thing.”“I’d better get dressed and go to town, and tell the rest of the family. I’llcall Duane and get him up here.” Duane is my brother. My father had died nearlythree years before, and Mom had been divorced from him long before that. Duanehad acted as father to the family in many ways in recent years.Mom explained she had trouble with night blindness, and asked Mike to drive herinto Taylor to my sister’s. Mike agreed, although he figured her request hadmore to do with being too upset to drive and not wanting to be alone.Deputy Coplan followed them in his pickup to Taylor, a small town outsideSnowflake. The heater did not work in the old Chevy carryall. The twenty-mileride in the old panel truck was miserably cold.Mike got Mom to the home of my sister Alison and her husband, Grant, at twentyminutes to three. Coplan and Mike went in while Mom told her daughter andson-in-law, as calmly as she could, what Mike had told her. Alison was true tofamily character. Although her first reaction was naturally incredulous, she didnot get hysterical or break down.Mom reached Duane in Phoenix shortly before 3:00 a.m. “Duane, get up here rightaway! Something’s happened to Travis. It looks like a flying saucer got him!”The tone in her voice jerked him instantly awake. “A what? Now say that again?”When she finished explaining what had happened, he told her to stay at Alison’s,that he was leaving immediately. It was nearly two hundred miles from Phoenix toSnowflake.“Could you give me a ride over to Snowflake now?” Mike asked wearily.“Sure, let’s go,” Coplan said. “That’s about all we can do for tonight.”Duane and his wife, Carol, were already speeding north out of the desert city ofPhoenix, where he worked as a farrier (horseshoer) and attended college. Duanehad been a guiding force in the family since Mom’s divorce from my father. ToMom, he was security itself. Duane is six feet two inches tall, nearly twohundred pounds of solid muscle. Twenty-six years old in 1975, he was an amateurboxer and rode bulls in rodeos. He was the sort of person who people listened towhen he talked.As he drove anxiously through the night, his brain clicked off thepossibilities. Was I hurt? Could I actually have been abducted by alien beings?Maybe there had been a mistake. Mom had not been too clear on the phone aboutwhether or not she was sure it had really happened. There might be a very simpleexplanation. The whole thing might be resolved when he got up to Snowflake.Perhaps I was really just out on a date or something, and someone had takenadvantage of my absence to pull off an insane practical joke. If that was thecase, there would be hell to pay if Duane caught the crazy bastard.It was an exhausted, haggard Mike Rogers that Undersheriff Ken Coplan let off infront of Rogers’ home at three o’clock that morning. Mike went in to a crowd ofpeople in his front room. Ken had gone home to his wife, but Dwayne, John, andAllen were there, along with a few of Mike’s relatives and even a neighbor.Leaving the excited jabbering, Mike went to bed. He tossed fitfully as the guiltof abandoning his friend tormented him. Finally he sank into the reprieve ofdeep sleep shortly before dawn."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5ManhuntFear makes men ready to believe the worst.—Quintus Curtius RufusNo one rested well that night. Sleep for some was thwarted by dream images ofshimmering metallic crafts blasting destructive rays in all directions. Whilemorning refused to accelerate its arrival, the idea of a man’s life hangingtenuously in the balance weighed too heavily for anyone to rest easy.Mom did not sleep at all. After Mike had left Alison’s with the under-sheriff,Mom drove over to Snowflake where Don, my oldest brother, and his wife Maryannelived with their two little girls.When he heard the news, Don reacted with barely concealed skepticism. Heimmediately suspected that the story about the flying saucer was a cover-up forsome kind of foul play.He knew my friends and I were always practicing “them fancy fighting techniques”we learned in karate class. He thought that playful sparring might have flaredinto a serious battle. His own redheaded temper had gotten him into his share offistfights. He knew how that sort of thing could get out of hand. He was carefulnot to express his suspicions to Mom, so as not to increase her anxiety. But hisown worry over the possibility generated some hostility in his attitude towardthe crew.Mom remained at Don’s house for a couple of hours, while he tried to reassureher. Nothing could be done until morning. Inaction increased the tension. Theclock slowly ticked off the minutes as the night dragged on.Sheriff Gillespie had managed a brief rest, but rose early to motivate hisforces. By sunrise the Navajo County Search and Rescue Team had been alerted,the Heber Forest Service recruited.Duane arrived at Alison’s at seven that morning to find no one there. He droveon into Snowflake and found everyone at Don’s. Mom had enlisted the help of afamily friend with a Jeep capable of traveling rugged back country. Withdaylight, everyone embraced the relief of taking action. My family piled intothe vehicles and left for Mike Rogers’ house.Duane arrived at Mike’s first. The living room there was jammed with some ofMike’s relatives and most of the men from his crew. Steve Pierce was the onlycrewman not present. The others had underestimated the severity of his conditionthe night before. He was still in a mild state of shock. Steve did not want toreturn to those woods again, ever. And, for then, he refused even to leave hishouse.No one had wakened Mike yet. His wife, Katy, had asked that he not be disturbedany sooner than necessary because he had spent such a terrible, restless night.When Duane came in, Katy went to wake her husband.While Mike dressed, Duane interrogated the other crewmen who were sitting aroundthe fireplace. If they were up to something, he was damn sure going to find out.Heaven help them if they were covering up for darker deeds.Mike came into the living room, puffy-eyed and wrung out.“Why didn’t you wake me up when everybody got here?” he asked Katy.“You needed your sleep,” she replied apologetically.“We wanted to get back out there and look for Travis as early as we could,” Mikesaid reproachfully. He eyed the early-morning sunlight already breaking throughthe tall trees across the street, pouring in the big front windows. Hisagitation increased. “Coplan said they’d be getting the search parties togetherin Heber at the crack of dawn!”Mike looked at the clock. It was 7:10 a.m. Every minute they delayed could bereducing their chances of a successful rescue. “We’ve got to get moving rightaway!”“We certainly do,” Duane agreed. “But Ma and the rest of them will be here in aminute. So, Mike, I want you and the rest of these guys to tell me about whathappened out there.”The men responded so openly to Duane’s questions that his doubts began to waver.He considered himself a good judge of character, and his assessment was thatthese men were telling the truth. Nobody—and especially not these guys—could actthat well. But Duane reserved judgment. He knew the coming search might turn upevidence of an entirely different sort.During Don’s drive to Mike’s, the seeds of suspicion in his mind had sproutedand grown into full-blown conviction. He became certain the crew were coveringup for a bloody chainsaw murder. He, too, had worked in the woods and knew whata chainsaw could do to human flesh. Ghastly images of my bloody, dismemberedbody tormented him as the horrible image grew more fixed in his mind.Don was upset and irritable, having been awakened at three in the morning. Notknowing what was going on increased his irritation. Mom had been able to tellhim only part of the story, and it seemed like no one else would tell himanything definite, either. Deputy Glen Flake had visited his house at nine thenight before, asking where he thought I might be. Flake had been asked not tolet out any details until the report was confirmed, so he only told Don to haveme report to Deputy Ellison if I should show up. Don’s temper was beginning toboil.Don stomped up Mike’s front steps and burst in the front door without knocking.Everyone stopped talking. He stood angrily surveying the group, his bootsplanted wide, his fists at his sides.“All right, dammit. Let’s have it!” he demanded furiously.No one answered him. They just stared at him in surprise.“I want to know what the hell is going on!” he raged. “I don’t believe thisflying-saucer crap for one damned minute! What did you do with Travis?”Dwayne Smith flared. “It don’t make any damn difference if you don’t believe us!It happened just like we said!”“You just keep quiet, boy!” Don pointed his finger threateningly at DwayneSmith.“Maybe you’d like to make something of it, cowboy!” Dwayne Smith counteredtestily. He slowly stood up, his six feet and seven inches towering over Don.They stood glaring into each other’s eyes.Everyone else sat in stunned silence at the outburst—except Duane, who wasfaintly amused.“All right, you guys, that’ll be enough!” Duane ordered. “Don, you’d better geton out of here and cool off!” Duane was more powerfully built than anyone in theroom and his status as a boxer established his physical advantage as a given.But Don’s anger would not be quelled.“I ain’t taking no orders from anybody!” Don shot back defiantly. He glowered atthe crewmen. “I’ll tell the rest of you guys one thing for damn sure,” hestormed. “And each and every one of you better listen up real careful. If youguys have done something to Travis, I’m going to personally stomp a mudhole inthe middle of every one of you!”“Don, that’s enough!” Duane interrupted. “You better just get on out of here andcalm yourself down!” Duane stood up. “Come on, Don,” he said quietly, headingfor the door.Don’s anger wasn’t completely spent, but he’d had his say. He followed Duaneout.Once outside, Duane said, “Don, I’m thinking some of the same things you are.But starting a ruckus right now isn’t going to solve anything.”“Yeah,” Don agreed. “But we’d better start getting some answers around here.”“If these guys have done away with Travis we’re sure to find out,” Duanepronounced ominously. “And if they did . . . they’ll have hell to pay from bothof us.”The others arrived and the group prepared to move. Mike got into the pickup withDuane and Mom. Don rode in the Jeep. The other crewmen left in Dwayne Smith’sstation wagon. The caravan set off for Heber.By the time they arrived, the sheriff s posse, U.S. Forest Service men, and theNavajo County Search and Rescue Team had gathered in front of the Exxon station.Police cars and four-wheel-drives and green government pickup trucks crowded thebig parking lot. Grim-faced men paced back and forth, gathering into tense,subdued huddles. A number of early risers were standing around watching. It wasobvious to those civilians that something more than a simple lost-person searchwas afoot. That none of the searchers would talk to them about it only piquedtheir interest.Duane pulled alongside a police car and asked a deputy: “How are you going toorganize this thing?”“There are some more men coming from Holbrook and in from some of the outlyingareas. We’ve got to get everybody gassed up here and we’ll meet out there. Thesheriff will organize everybody and we’ll move from there.”“Well, we’re going to go on out there to see what we can find in the meantime.”Duane’s pickup led my family and friends into the woods. One or two ForestService trucks joined the mountain-bound brigade. The search party soonfollowed. When the vehicles arrived at Turkey Springs, a number of ForestService trucks were parked under the pines at the turnoff to the contract. Theydrove on to the abduction site and found the Forest Service men already lookingaround.Mike and the crewmen took Duane and Mom to where they had sighted the flyingsaucer. They showed them where the truck had stopped and went over the patternof events to give a fairly clear picture of what had happened.The caravan of search parties began to arrive. The growing crowd of vehiclesparked near the site in a large clearing in the trees. Truck after truck ofsearchers gathered there. Over fifty men were present, almost all of themtrained to handle emergencies. Sheriff Marlin Gillespie called the men togetherfor briefing.“Okay, attention everyone, gather around here. . . What we’re looking for is aman down, or wandering around dazed—possibly injured. The man is about six feetin height . . . one hundred sixty-five pounds . . . red hair. He was last seenwearing Levi’s and a blue denim jacket. Look for articles of clothing that mayhave been discarded. Keep a close eye out for tracks or any other fresh signs.Look for blood or anything unusual, anything out of the ordinary. ... If youshould find anything at all, report back to me immediately.” He surveyed thegroup. “Any questions?” Everyone apparently understood. “We’re going to start upthere at the Rim Road. We’ll space ourselves out equally, staying within closesight of the man on either side at all times. When we get down to the lowerroad, we’ll regroup and make another sweep. All right, men, let’s go.”Mike was displeased when his suggestion of using tracking dogs appeared to beignored. He, the other crewmen, and my family, were not asked to join theorganized search, so they took up their own. The professionals knew their job,but help couldn’t hurt.Later that morning, a Forest Service man walked up to Dwayne Smith, grabbed hisshirtfront and twisted it, pulling Dwayne’s face close to his own. “All right,”he snarled, “where’d ya hide the body?”Dwayne protested: “What body? We didn’t kill nobody. Dammit, there was a flyingsaucer here, just like we told you!”My brother Duane walked up behind the burly forest ranger. “Hey you! Knock itoff!” Some quality in that quiet voice left no doubt as to the wisest course ofaction. The man released his grip on Dwayne Smith’s shirt and turned around,still defiant.“You’ve got better things to do than stand around hassling people,” Duanesuggested. The man started to speak. Then, looking Duane up and down, he changedhis mind. He turned and stalked off.“We did not kill him,” Dwayne Smith stated hotly. He looked at the small groupof searchers standing about. “I’ll even take a lie-detector test to prove it!”“Yeah, we’ll take lie-detector tests, truth serum, or any damn thing they wantto throw at us, ’cause we’re telling the truth!” John joined in. The other crewmembers chimed their agreement.Meanwhile, my brother Don was conducting a very thorough search of his own. Hewas down on the piling strip where work had ended the night before. He rootedaround in any soil that had been even slightly disturbed. He rolled over bigrotting logs, dreading what he expected to find. Don looked into every hole andhollow log where even a piece of a corpse could be hidden. He dug into all thelarge slash-piles of dead wood, kicked apart all the smaller green piles thathad been stacked in recent days. That strip of piling was certainly not going topass Forest Service inspection.Back up at the clearing, all the Forest Service men were bringing in armloads oflitter. They were taking advantage of the sweep to clean up the woods. Nowthat’s dedication!They rounded up a disgusting amount of refuse for such a remote area. Oldlicense plates, pieces of exhaust pipe, pop bottles, oil cans, even cigarettewrappers. They put the trash in the back of their trucks for disposal at theranger station. They had found nearly every scrap of cast-off debris in thatsquare mile, but had not found hide nor hair of anything that might indicatewhat had happened to me.At the edge of the clearing, Mike noticed a man in a Forest Service uniformholding some sort of a small sensing device to the ground. The device wasconnected by a cord to a sophisticated-looking electronic instrument. Mike wentover to see what was going on.“Is that one of those radiation-checking things?” Mike asked.“A Geiger counter, yes,” the man curtly replied. “The sheriff requested it.”The man turned away. Mike followed him into the shade of the nearby pines.Allen, Duane, and a few others joined them.“Is that thing finding any radiation?” Mike asked.“No, there’s no radiation here.” The man passed the device along the ground,then put it up to some overhanging branches.“Well, why are you checking here? If there was any radiation it would be overthere where the thing was at,” Mike suggested, pointing to the pile of logsacross the clearing.Without answering, the Forest Service man began checking the ground abouthalfway to the pile.“Why don’t you check right at the pile?” Duane asked, irritated by the man’suncooperative attitude. “Radiation would be strongest at the point nearest thesource.”The Forest Service man continued to ignore the men’s suggestions and beganrolling up the cord of his instrument, putting it away.“Hey,” Mike proposed. “What about testing us?”“Yeah!” Allen agreed. “See if we got any on us!”The man began unrolling the cord again impatiently. He held the sensor up toAllen and Mike.“See?” he said in an “I told you so” tone. “Nothing.”“Well, is that thing working? The dial says one and a half—what’s that mean?”Mike questioned.“That one and a half is background radiation. See, it registers that everywherehere.” He waved the Geiger pickup around. “And yes, it’s working, and this isthe right setting,” he added testily “I’ve got it set as high as it will go justto pick up a background reading . . . look how it reads on a radium-dial watch.”He held the pickup close to another Forest Service man’s wrist. The widelyspaced ticks came closer together as the needle swung up to a reading of three.“Maybe we don’t have any on us because we’ve taken baths and changed ourclothes,” Mike said. “Wouldn’t that make a difference?”“Maybe,” he grunted indifferently.“Well, our hats are the same as they were,” Allen said, taking off his metalhard hat.Mike removed his own hard hat, of orange plastic.“Test these,” Mike offered.As the Geiger pickup moved closer to the first hat, the erratic ticking of thedevice increased—the needle swung all the way up to six! That reading wasduplicated on the second hard hat.The Forest Service man gave Allen and Mike a long, cynical stare. Abruptly herolled up the cord of his Geiger counter and walked away.“Hey, what about testing the truck?” Mike called to the man’s retreating back.The man kept walking, not even turning to look.Up and down the ridges the searching sweeps went on. The search spread wider;still no trace of anything to raise hope. As the afternoon dragged past, someonebrought a huge load of lunches out to the weary men. Footsore groups ofsearchers stopped by the clearing and rested their backs against the trees whilethey ate.At the end of the day no one had found anything of significance. When thesheriff dismissed the searchers, they left under the dark cloud of a single,grim thought: If they found the man when the search resumed the next day, theywould not find him alive. No one could survive two nights in those woods atnear-zero temperatures.My family and the crewmen spent the evening waiting, hoping that something wouldhappen. The talk late that night resembled the mourning conversation carried onat a wake. No one knew what to do. All their hopes were pinned on the searchstill in progress.The next day Mike and Duane went out early with a friend in his Jeep. Duane hadruined a tire in that rugged Turkey Springs area and left his Truck inSnowflake.The second day of the search was much like the first. Sweep after sweep madeover the same ground. The only difference was the decline of enthusiasm in thesearchers. They had not found anything the day before, increasing the chancesthat the second day would be the same.Mom knew Mike well enough so that after she had a couple of days to think aboutit, she had few doubts about what the men had seen. She began to feel thatsearching further was worthless. It seemed obvious to her that if I had not beenfound right away in the immediate vicinity, it was not very likely I was there.That afternoon, she expressed her feelings to Sheriff Marlin Gillespie who toldher he was beginning to feel the same way. That evening, after a second completeday of fruitless effort, the sheriff officially called off the search.Family and friends went home with the heavy feeling that they would never see meagain. The pressure and the sleepless nights had begun to catch up witheveryone. Mike had finally succumbed, napping most of the day in the back of thebouncing Jeep.That evening after they returned to town, Deputy Glen Flake paid Mike a visit.\"Heard you men volunteered for lie-detector tests,” he began. “Is everyone stillwilling?”“Yeah,” Mike answered. “We’re willing to take any test they want to give us.We’d like to prove that what some people are saying just isn’t true!”“Well, the sheriff heard that you guys offered and he’s gonna take you up on it.He’s arranged to give all you guys lie-detector tests.”“Good,” Mike replied. “When are they going to be?”“Eight o’clock Monday morning. You’re supposed to show up at the courthouse inHolbrook,” he said, getting up to leave. “Make sure nobody leaves town, allright?”\"Sure, nobody’s planning to go anywhere as far as I know, but I’ll tell 'em,”Mike assured Deputy Flake as he left.The visit made Mike feel a little less depressed. At least they’d have a chanceto prove they hadn’t killed me and that they had seen what they said they hadseen. Ken, Allen, John, Steve, and Dwayne would sure be glad to hear about thelie-detector tests.Members of my family got to talking things over that evening. They began toworry that perhaps the search had been called off prematurely. The possibilitythat I had only been injured, that I might still be alive, nagged at all ofthem. Even if I was lying dead out there somewhere, they would at least want meto have a proper burial, before the buzzards arrived. Prior to turning in forthe night, they finally resolved to get a wider search going—even if they had toundertake it themselves.Saturday morning Duane and Mike went to Holbrook to talk to Sheriff Gillespie.They pleaded with him to renew the search. “What if Travis is still out there?”they asked him. “We can’t afford to lose the chance that we could still find himalive.” They argued, perhaps more forcefully than politely, for another attemptto be made.Finally the sheriff agreed. He could not very well refuse a request from themissing man’s family. He picked up the telephone and by four o’clock thatafternoon the returning search parties were joined by half a dozen men onhorseback, a couple of expertly piloted turbine helicopters, and spotters infixed-wing aircraft.The widest, most intensive part of the search got under way.Sheriff Gillespie had been cautious about releasing the report of the UFOabduction to the public. He realized the potential for panic, or false alarm, ifI turned up. He had obtained the cooperation of the local radio stations inputting a lid on the news. The rumors that did leak out prompted telephonecalls, fielded by radio stations and the sheriff’s office with the response onlythat a search was on for a lost person.Inevitably, however, the news escaped (probably via people listening to policescanner radios) to the larger television and radio stations. The media unearthedthe story and, with electronic speed, the entire world was hearing theincredible report.Along with the expanded search team came UFO investigators and reporters from asfar away as London, England. Sightseers were underfoot everywhere. One UFOinvestigator, William Spaulding, of Ground Saucer Watch (GSW) of Phoenix,reported his group had taken some extraordinary electromagnetic readings at theslash-pile near where the craft had been and in the area above which the crafthad hovered. Spaulding suggested it was indicative of the previous presence of acraft, possibly due to some kind of antigravity propulsion. He also reportedfinding residual traces of ozone in the area.The release of the story to the media caused problems worse than sightseersgetting in the way. The telephones at the sheriff s office and at my sister’shome never ceased ringing. All day the calls kept coming in. Some callers werenot mere curiosity seekers. My family’s burden was increased by some people’sinsane concept of humor.Some of the prank calls were just nonsense, and easily dismissed. Others causedthe Sheriff's Department to expend valuable manpower in tracking down falsereports. I was reported to have been seen strolling alone in a variety of placesall over the county. One woman pretended to be Mrs. Travis Walton (at that timethere was no such person), and said she’d received a message from her husband—hewas safe on Mars. Very funny. Many UFO sightings were reported. It seemed as ifeverybody was out looking at the sky. reporting every little thing out of theordinary.Some calls were serious and well-meaning. Several calls verged on the ominous.A retired CIA officer warned the family of possible covert governmentintervention. The man sounded sincere and left his name and address.A nurse related an incident in which an elderly couple reportedly recoveringfrom a UFO experience disappeared from a hospital where she was working. Theirrecords also reportedly vanished and the top staff acted as if the incident hadnever occurred.During those hectic days the telephone became the lifeline and the worst enemyof everyone involved.Everybody was tired from sleeplessness and harassment. As if the searchers didnot have enough problems, a horse bolted early Saturday evening, for no apparentreason, and could not be found.All day Sunday the search widened. The men on horseback covered ridge afterridge. The helicopters circled wider and wider. Light planes criss-crossed thearea. The quest was even broadened to cover the steep rugged terrain south ofthe Rim on the Apache Indian Reservation. The diligent rescue teams combed mileafter square mile of that forested mountain country.Finally, when the search was ended Sunday evening, there was no doubt inanyone’s mind that I was definitely not lost in the forest wilderness. A massivefour-day manhunt costing ten thousand dollars and involving over men had beenfruitless.However, the search had not been totally useless. It served to establish onething—where the missing man was not. That left the obvious question. Where wasTravis Walton?To Duane, the answer was now as obvious as the question. He sat with the grouparound the campfire at the site, musing over the days of searching. He sat withhis back to the dark woods, staring into the dancing flames. He realized therest of the family had come to believe that I was safe somewhere—out ofdesperate hope, the need to believe. He had flown high over the area in one ofthe helicopters, looking down with high-powered binoculars. The flight had beennothing new to him; he had often parachuted from helicopters in his army days.But the ride had brought home to him the futility of the search; also thereality of man and machine in flight. Pulling his collar up against the cold,Duane lay back and gazed up into the night sky.“Could Travis be up there somewhere?” he wondered. “Yes—he must be up there.”The idea appealed to Duane’s adventurous nature. “If he is out there somewhere,he’s probably having the experience of a lifetime.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6A Kidnapping ... or a Killing?Truth will come to light; murder cannot be hid long.—Shakespeare, The Merchant of VeniceNovember 10, 1975. The day the final determination would be made in answer tothe question of what really happened at Turkey Springs on the evening ofNovember 5.The unsuccessful search had left only two possibilities in the minds of thepublic and members of the Sheriff's Department. Either the men had indeedwitnessed the abduction of their coworker by a UFO, or they were covering up forwhat could possibly be a gory chainsaw murder.The crewmen were more eager than anyone to settle that question once and forall. Early that Monday morning they gathered at Mike Rogers’ house, then piledinto several cars, along with a few family members, heading for Holbrook.When the men got out of their cars in the county courthouse parking lot, theywere immediately thronged by newsmen. There were crowds of newspaper andmagazine reporters, plus radio and television crews. The enthusiastic media menshoved microphones into their faces. The cameras followed them into thecourthouse. The more persistent of the newsmen took up a daylong watch outsidethe Sheriff’s Office building.The crew and their group crowded into the small outer vestibule of the waitingroom. The jailer/dispatcher, at his desk behind the glass, looked up withinterest at their approach.“We’re here for the polygraph tests to be given today,” they announced.“Right. You’re expected. The examiner isn’t here yet,” the deputy replied.“You’ll just have to take a seat and wait. I’ll tell the sheriff you’re here.”The single bench in the little room was not nearly large enough for them all to“take a seat.” The men’s wives and mothers already filled the bench.The space also served as a visitors’ room for the prisoners who were kept on theother side of the heavy steel doors at the end of the room. The office had thetired look all twenty-four-hour offices acquire.The smell of tobacco and despair wafted in from the cellblock, to mix with theodor of coffee and fatigue in the office. It was not going to be a pleasantwait.After twenty-five minutes the men began to fidget. The standing-room-onlyconditions aggravated an already emotionally loaded situation. Newsmen kepttrying to shoulder into the overcrowded room.“Hey, are you guys the ones who think they saw the little green men?” one of thenewsmen asked sarcastically.“Stick it!” one of the crew called in return.The men started grumbling among themselves. “I’m getting tired of this waitingbusiness!” one of the men complained.“I came down here to take a polygraph test,” another joined in, “not to standaround.”“You know, like we were talking about this morning,” Allen’s mother began. “I’veheard that the government tries to hush up UFO reports. You should be careful. ..”“Hey!” somebody called to the deputy at the desk. “How long are we going to haveto stand here?”Just then, Sheriff Marlin Gillespie entered the office from the narrow hallwaythat led from the rear offices.“Good morning,” he greeted them perfunctorily. “I’ve been talking things overwith the polygraph examiner. He’s setting up his equipment in one of the backoffices we’ll be using for a testing room. You guys can come with me now.” Heled the men back the way he had entered, down the hallway and out into thesunshine at the rear of the building.Behind the courthouse building was an unpaved compound enclosed by high stonewalls and, on the opposite side, the jail kitchen. The sheriff and a deputy ledthe group across the courtyard to the kitchen.The six crewmen, my brother Duane, Sheriff Gillespie, and his deputy jammed thekitchen. Seating themselves on tables and benches, they waited to hear whatwould happen next.The sheriff spoke first. “I felt we needed to have a conference before we begin,to sort of let you know how the testing is going to be arranged. We’ve gotcertain rules you’re going to have to follow. We can only test one person at atime. We want you all to remain back here and, as each one of you is tested, youare to remain here. However, we don’t want the tested people associating withthe untested people. So, when you’re finished, stick around. But don’t conversewith the untested people. These tests are going to take all day, so . . .”Everybody groaned. They were all under a lot of pressure from the reporters aswell as from the accusations of suspicious people. The previous days had leftthem edgy. It looked as if it was going to be another hell of a day.Gillespie continued: “We’re going to require you to sign a consent waiver formbefore testing. This statement gives us the right to test you and to use theresults as evidence in a court of law. Just be sure you understand that when yousign. The examiner can explain it more fully to you if you have any questions.”He paused briefly. “You need to work out an order between you. It doesn’t matterwhich of you goes first. So—however you want to work it.”Just then a large, lean man with dark brown hair and a tanned, serious faceentered the room.“This is Mr. Cy Gilson,” the sheriff introduced the man. “He’s the Department ofPublic Safety polygraph examiner. He’ll be the one testing all of you.”Allen spoke the thought that had been making them all uneasy. “How do we know wecan trust this guy? We’ve heard that the government is always trying to hushthese kinda things up. How do we know you’re not gonna rig these lie-detectortests?”The men began murmuring between themselves. They had nothing to lose if this guywas on the level, but if he was not, they could be tried for murder. The ideatook hold and the grumbling increased.Mr. Gilson snorted at the affront. “I’ll guarantee you one thing. If you guysare telling the truth, those charts will show it. And if you’re lying, I’ll findthat out, too.”“Your guarantee doesn’t necessarily mean anything,” Mike countered. “You wouldsay that even if you’ve been bought off!”Gilson was indignant. “What’s your problem?” he shot back. “Are you lying?” Helightly popped Mike on the shoulder with the back of his fingers. “Hell no,we’re not lying!” Mike returned hotly. “We’re really only worried that you’vebeen bought off. It’s not impossible, you know. We’ve heard that the governmenttries to keep these UFO things quiet.”Tempers flared and all of them began raising their voices. No one was more angrythan Gilson at the insult to his integrity.“You don’t have a single thing to worry about—unless you’re lying.” As he spoke,Gilson again slapped Mike on the shoulder with the back of his hand.“There’s one way we can make sure these lie-detector tests are on theup-and-up,” Duane interjected. “We can tape-record the tests. There was a UFOresearcher out there at the site who told me he had access to this PSE computerthing, uh—a Psychological Stress Evaluation, he called it. We could run the tapethrough that computer to make sure the lie-detector tests were valid. PSE issupposed to be one-hundred-percent accurate.”Examiner Gilson was outraged. “I want to tell you men something about that PSE.I’ve seen a lot of research on the PSE. I’ve even done some research on itpersonally. The data shows that PSE is worse than worthless—it’s downrightdangerous. PSE is only twenty-percent accurate, whereas polygraph testing isconsistently ninety-seven percent accurate!”“You’re just trying to get out of taping,” Duane cut in. “If you didn’t havesomething to hide, you’d allow taping!”“I never allow taping of my tests,” Gilson retorted. “There isn’t a singlemethod of lie detection available better than the polygraph. Why do you thinkit’s the method used by law enforcement?”“He’s just trying to hide something,” Dwayne Smith jeered. “Let’s not take thesedamn tests!”Everyone started yelling at once. The situation was getting out of control.“All right,” Gillespie broke in. “Hold on! Hold on, everybody!” His words werealmost as effective as bullets fired into the air. The men respected SheriffGillespie because of his fair treatment of them in the woods, and the way he hadhandled the search. Everybody stopped talking and listened.“Let’s just calm down a minute here. You six men all came down here to takethese lie-detector tests voluntarily,” he reasoned. “If you decide not to takethem, no one can stop you. If you want to pick up and leave, it’s entirely up toyou. But I’d like to point something out to you. A lot of people are thinkingthat you guys are guilty of murdering Walton. You haven’t been arrested oranything yet, but things could become pretty hard for you if Walton never turnsup—even if you’re telling the truth. If you are telling the truth, then thesetests are going to clear you. You don’t have a thing to worry about from Mr.Gilson. I will give my personal guarantee that these tests will be conductedfairly.”The men were impressed by the sheriff's speech. Their misgivings were visiblymollified.Mike said, “What do you guys think?”The approving looks they exchanged expressed their unanimous vote.“Okay, sir, if we have your guarantee, we’ll go on and take the tests,” Mikesaid to the sheriff. “Remember, it’s in your hands, though.”Cy Gilson was still the picture of outraged indignation. His honesty had neverbeen so insolently questioned in all his years in polygraphy. The examinerstalked from the room without another word.“I’m going to go help Mr. Gilson prepare for testing,” said Gillespie, stridingout. He turned at the door and added, “You guys work out the order you want tobe tested in. We’ll be calling for the first one right away.”After he departed, the men drew straws to determine who would go in what order.Steve Pierce was first. After they worked out the sequence, the deputy came overfrom the courthouse and escorted Steve to the testing room.Cy Gilson went over the questions with Steve, and explained the polygraphmachine and procedure. Gilson then sat Steve down in a chair and wired him up.The examiner attached electrical pickups to Steve’s hand and passed a flexibleblack rubber hose around his chest. Then the constricting band of the bloodpressure cuff was tightened around the subject’s left bicep. Steve started tofeel like a guinea pig in an electric chair.When Steve coughed or moved, the needles on the machine scratched wildly backand forth on the rolling chart of paper. The examiner told him to sit very stilland relax. Every breath, every beat of his heart, his every reaction would traceitself neatly in colored ink. The tiniest fluctuation in his body responseswould be precisely recorded for the examiner’s expert analysis.Steve’s test lasted nearly two hours. At that rate it was going to be a long dayof waiting for the man last in line.Allen Dalis’ test was second. He entered the examination room just before noonin a very suspicious and agitated state. He was the most excitable member of thegroup. The days of suspense, heckling by curious people and newsmen, andaccusations from all quarters, had rattled him more than a little. Seeing theUFO had affected him more than any of the others, except possibly Steve Pierce.After little more than an hour, Allen stormed out of the testing room. He loudlycursed the examiner and slammed the door behind him.\"I know that son of a bitch has been bought off!” he told the waiting men. \"Hekeeps acting like he thinks I killed Travis. I’m damned sure not lying and ifthe bastard says I am, then I know he’s the one who’s lying.”“What makes you think he’s been paid off, Allen?” Mike asked. “Did he tell youthe results of your test?”“No, it’s just that he keeps acting like he don’t believe us about the UFO!”Allen fumed.“Well, Allen, if he didn’t actually say you failed your test, why are you somad? These guys are probably supposed to act like they don’t believe us,” Mikereasoned.The other crew members started grumbling and talking about driving back toSnowflake.“Hold on, everybody,” Mike said. “There’s no call to fly off the handle!” Mike,who had drawn the straw for fifth place, volunteered: “I’ll go in next and havea talk with the guy. Maybe I can find out what’s going on.”Mike went into the testing room and had a long talk with the examiner. Heexplained Allen’s volatility as simply being one facet of his usual behavior,and that Allen was still overwrought from seeing the UFO. During his talk withGilson Mike began to feel that he could trust the man. Mike’s, testing thenbegan. A tedious hour and a half later, three or four separate tests werecompleted on Mike, as had been performed on the other two men.When the examiner was through, he made no comment. While he was being releasedfrom the polygraph machine’s sensitive black tentacles, Mike said, halfdefiantly: “I told you I was telling the truth.” The poker-faced Gilson stillwouldn’t make any statement as to what he thought the charts showed. Mike,confident in the examiner and knowing he was telling the truth, didn’t need tobe told.He went outside into the dirt courtyard and told the men that everything was allright and to go on with the testing. Ken Peterson, Dwayne Smith, and JohnGoulette each took their tests in turn.The tested men hung around the courthouse waiting to see what happened. To fillthe time, the men played basketball and sparred with boxing gloves—sportsequipment kept in the kitchen for the prisoner trustees. Some of the men playedcards. The day dragged on.Newsmen, after interviewing the men at great length, found nothing better to dowith their time than film the men at their games. Playful sparring andbasketball did not seem to be the likely pastimes of men being tested formurder. Obviously the men were bored, not worried.Finally, John Goulette came out. It had been a grueling thirteen hours foreveryone. The crew had waited all day to hear the results of the tests. Theother men waited in the kitchen area while my brother Duane and Mike went intothe courthouse to hear what Gilson had to say.Darkness had fallen; the swarm of reporters had long since drifted away. Thewood-floored hallway to the testing room was deserted. The building was quietexcept for the echoing coughs of a prisoner in the nearby cell-block.They entered the testing room and found Cy Gilson standing behind the woodendesk, carefully putting away his polygraph instruments. There was a huge stackof paper charts on the desk—the test results of six men. The squiggly tracingsof the jagged, colored ink lines were unreadable to the untrained eye.“Well, what’s the final verdict?” Duane asked.The examiner seemed awed, or at least perplexed, as if he had unexpectedlyuncovered something profound. But what? “I can’t really say right now,” he beganquietly. “You’ll have to wait until I make my final report.” He turned hisattention to carefully removing the slender needles of the ink-tracing pens.Mike and Duane were frustrated. They had waited all day to hear the final word.Mr. Gilson said, “Excuse me a minute, I’ve got to wash the ink out of thesebefore they dry.” He carried the thin chrome needles out the door. Duane andMike followed him to the washroom at the end of the hall.“We have a right to know the results of these tests,” Duane began earnestly.“When is your report going to come out?”Gilson finished rinsing the colored ink out of his instruments. “I have to goover these charts very closely first. That should only take a few days. I’llprobably send the sheriff my report by the end of the week.” He walked back tothe testing room to finish packing his equipment. Mike and Duane doggedlypursued him.“Couldn’t you at least tell us—unofficially?” Mike persisted. “You must havesome idea of how they turned out, from what you’ve seen of them so far.”Examiner Gilson stopped and looked at Duane and Mike. “I guess it wouldn’t hurtanything to tell you—seeing the way the tests apparently came out. . . . Realizethis, though—this is just a preliminary evaluation. I could go over these chartsmore closely and come up with an entirely different opinion. So keep this underyour hat and don’t tell any newsmen until after I make my official report.” Hecleared his throat. “From what I’ve been able to see from these charts, you menare apparently telling the truth!”“Well, we’d like to apologize for this morning,” Mike said, offering his hand.“It looks like we badly misjudged you.”Gilson’s voice betrayed his amazement. “When I started testing you men thismorning, I really expected to find that a murder had been committed. After allthose hard words this morning, and the way Allen Davis reacted, I was even moresure of foul play. But none of the tests except Allen’s showed anything likethat. Allen was just too agitated to be tested at all. Even if his charts hadbeen readable and showed foul play, he couldn’t have committed a crime and madeup a story about a UFO without involving five other men whose tests corroboratewhat they reported.”Cy Gilson shook his head soberly. He put his hand on the stack of lie-detectorcharts. “Incredible,” he muttered."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7ReturnWho never doubted never half believed;Where doubt, the truth is—tis her shadow.—P.J. BaileyApprehension had steadily grown in the Mogollon Rim area since that fatefulforest encounter. Fear made some people prefer to believe that something asominous as a UFO kidnapping could not happen in their quiet little community.But as time dragged on after the mysterious disappearance, many began to facethe more obvious possibility in answer to the grim question, “Where is TravisWalton?”It had been nearly five days and six hours since the beginning of my horribleordeal.I regained consciousness lying on my stomach, my head on my right forearm. Goldair brought me instantly awake. I looked up in time to see a light turn off onthe bottom of a curved, gleaming hull. As I’d raised my head up, a white lightcaught my eye just before it blinked off. Either a light had been turned off ora hatch had closed, cutting off the light from inside. I only caught a glimpseas I raised my head; I could not be sure which it was.Then I saw the mirrored outline of a rounded, silvery disc hovering four feetabove the paved surface of the road. It must have been about forty feet indiameter because it extended several feet off the left side of the road. It wastoo large for the highway and it extended past the roadside to my left to cleara cutaway rock embankment on the other side of the highway. It appeared to beabout fourteen feet high in the center.For an instant it floated silently above the road, a dozen yards away. I couldsee the night sky, the surrounding trees, and the highway center line reflectedin the curving mirror of its hull. I noticed a faint warmth radiating onto myface. Then, abruptly, it shot vertically into the sky, creating a strong breezethat stirred the nearby pine boughs and rustled the dry oak leaves that lay inthe dry grass beside the road. It gave off no light; and it was almost instantlylost from sight.The most striking thing about its departure was its quietness. It seemedimpossible that something so large, moving through the atmosphere at such speed,would not have shrieked through the air, or even broken the sound barrier with asonic boom. Yet it had been totally silent!I scrambled shakily to my feet. My legs felt rubbery. I swayed, then caught mybalance. I noticed the bluish white glowing dots of a couple of streetlightsdown the hill. I looked around and recognized the deserted stretch of curvingroad as the highway that wound down the canyon into Heber from the west.I was overjoyed to be in familiar surroundings. It felt so good to have my feetback on the sweet earth. I still felt a little pain in my head and chest, alittle weak, but otherwise I was physically intact. The memory of what hadhappened to me ran through my mind like a recurring nightmare. Struggling tograsp the thought that all this really had happened left me dazed and in a stateof shock.I ran wildly down the deserted highway, across the bridge into Heber, stoppingat the new building across from the Union 76 service station. Smoke billowedfrom the chimney and lights blazed inside, but no one answered my desperateknocking. No cars passed by.I ran on down the highway, over the second bridge, to the row of telephonebooths at the Exxon station. I entered the first of the phone booths andfrantically dialed the operator. (A dime was not required to reach an operatorin our part of the country.) My panic grew with the discovery that the telephonewas out of order! Nearly exhausted from my wild run, I staggered out of thatphone booth and into the next, relieved to find this one functioning. I dialedthe operator and panted out the number of my sister, Alison Neff. She was theonly nearby relative with a telephone.My brother-in-law Grant answered. It was 12:05 a.m.I was in an incredible mental state, difficult to describe. As best I canremember, I shouted something like: “They brought me back!” Then I babbled, “I’mout here in Heber, please get somebody to come and get me!” My hand shook as Iheld the cold receiver.Grant was not amused by the prank calls the family had been receiving.He took this call to be another cruel joke. “Uh, I think you have the wrongnumber,” he replied sarcastically, starting to hang up.'‘Wait! It’s me, Travis!” I screamed hysterically into the receiver.“Where are you?” he asked, still suspicious of a joke.“I’m at the Heber Exxon station.”“Okay,” he replied, almost apologetically, yet still cautious of a prank. “Stayright there. I’ll get Don or Duane and come and get you. Just hang on.”I remember hanging up and slumping down. Cradling my head on my knees, I huggedmy shins. My nerves felt frayed; I was cold and weary. I waited in a sort ofnumb daze, or shock, for help to arrive.Grant drove the three miles from Taylor over to Snowflake and found Duane atMom’s house. He told Duane about the call, and of his doubts it was really me.Duane, too, thought the call might have been yet another example of someone’sidiotic concept of humor. But they decided they couldn’t risk not investigating.The rest of the family was overjoyed. Hope was rekindled. Grant and Duanecautioned them not to get their hopes up too high. Since they were not sure,they did not notify the authorities, but immediately set out for Heber,thirty-three miles away.Lights suddenly shone into the phone booth. Relief flooded over me when I raisedmy head and saw the headlights of Duane’s pickup. Duane and Grant got out andcame to where I was still slumped in the phone booth. Duane opened the glassdoor of the booth and helped me to my feet.“Easy, Travis, take it easy, man!” Duane soothed me as I haltingly tried tospeak. “Don’t try to talk now.”“Am I ever glad to see you!” Grant said.Duane helped me into the warm truck and asked Grant to drive. On the way toSnowflake I tried to tell them about what happened to me, but I just couldn’tget it all out.“They were awful—white skin—great big eyes ...” I sobbed in horror.“Take it easy, Travis, you’re all right now. They didn’t harm you, did they?”“No . . . but those eyes, those horrible eyes! They just kept looking at me!” Ichoked out in broken gasps.“Just so you’re okay, that’s all that counts,” Duane said. “Everyone has beenworried sick about you.”“If it’s already after midnight, I must have been unconscious for a couple ofhours,” I replied shakily. “Because I only remember about an hour or an hour anda half inside that thing.”Duane and Grant looked at me strangely.“Travis, feel your face,” Duane said.“Good hell, I just shaved this morning and it feels like a week’s growth!” Iexclaimed, still not comprehending.“Travis,” Duane said gently, “you’ve been missing for five days!”My mouth dropped open. I took a hard look at the date on my watch. “FIVE DAYS?”I screeched. “Good God! What has happened to me?” I ran my hand again over theheavy growth of rough stubble on my jaw. “Five days?” I repeated numbly. “Fivedays.”My mind reeled, trying to comprehend the staggering implications of thisrevelation. I muttered in wonder, “That means that. . . oh no . . . that can’tbe. . .“As long as you’re all right there’s no need to talk. Just try to calm down forright now,” Duane said. To Grant he said: “That crazy mob of reporters is notgoing to get ahold of this guy, I’ll guarantee you that right now! He’s not inany shape to be talking to anyone. If they wouldn’t leave Mom alone in the shapeshe’s in, it isn’t likely they’ll be any different with Travis.” He put his armprotectively over my shoulders. I slumped down in the seat and gave up on tryingto talk.The ride back to Snowflake was an eerie one. Duane’s work truck had an extremelyloose steering mechanism and Grant was unaccustomed to driving it. The highspeed caused the truck to veer wildly at every bump and groove in the pavement.There had been a lot of control burning of wood debris by the Forest Service tothe south, and the wind carried the thick, pale gray smoke across the highway.It was like the weird ground fog you would see in the cemetery of some horrormovie.When we arrived at Mom’s house, no one was there. Duane had sent his wife Carolwith Mom over to Alison’s to be near a telephone in case he had to call her fromHeber. Grant went on over to Taylor in his own car to get Alison and Mom. Whilehe was gone, Duane had me change into fresh clothes.Duane had decided it was best not to tell anyone yet of my return. He could seeI was a long way from being up to interviews. Newsmen and law enforcementofficials would insist on launching a torrent of questioning immediately.Duane’s memory was fresh with the hounding and questioning endured by the familyin the preceding days; he knew it was certain to be even worse for me. I was notready to go through that.Duane’s first priority was for me to see a doctor immediately, but to see alocal doctor would mean getting mobbed by the curious. A local physician wouldmean waiting till morning anyway. By that time we could be in Phoenix, where Icould see a doctor under confidential conditions. As the UFO investigatorWilliam Spaulding had advised, a complete physical check for radiation damage orother possible ill effects of my ordeal seemed the most sensible first step totake.While I was changing my clothes in the bathroom, Duane noticed a single reddishdot on the inside of my right elbow. I told him I didn’t know how I had receivedit. I didn’t remember getting punctured or injected during my experience, but Itold him that I might have been poked by thorns or something out at work. Ididn’t have any other major cuts, skin lesions, or bruises.I weighed in on the bathroom scale at 154 pounds. I had lost over ten pounds infive days.Duane had me put the work clothes that I’d removed in a paper sack for laterexamination. I had a little trouble standing, but it was probably from weaknessrather than loss of equilibrium. I no longer felt dizzy. All the pain in my headand chest had disappeared. I sat down on the edge of the bathtub to finishchanging.I was terribly hungry and thirsty. I drank glass after glass of water. I wasravenous, but after stuffing some cookies in my mouth and eating some cottagecheese, I felt a little nauseated. I lay down in the bedroom for a while, butthoughts of those horrid creatures would not let me rest.When my mother and sister arrived there was a tearful reunion, as though I hadreturned from the dead. I guess for them I had. It had been only a couple ofhours for me, but for them it had been a week of worry and uncertainty that hadslowly evolved into a half-mourning despair. In spite of my own condition, I wasstill very moved by their care and by the depth of their suffering. And this wasjust the first of many ways the aftermath of the incident would add, layer uponlayer, to my burden of distress.Duane had gone outside to siphon some gas from one of the other cars for thetrip to Phoenix. There were no all-night service stations in Snowflake.County Deputy Glen Flake came by the house and noticed the lights on. He sawDuane siphoning the gas and stopped to investigate. Flake did not reveal thatSheriff Gillespie had received a tip from someone at the telephone company thata call from Heber had been received at the Neff residence. Gillespie had ordereda couple of deputies out to dust the phone booths for fingerprints, and calledDeputy Flake to ask him to go over and watch the highway from Heber. Flake hadapparently not received the call in time, as he’d missed our return to town.Flake got out of the car and asked Duane what he was doing. Duane explainedtruthfully that he was getting gas to return home to Phoenix. He kept hisresolve to shield me and delay the news of my return. The warning calls receivedfrom well-wishers had planted seeds of caution. If such \"engineered vanishings”were real, he was going to make sure his brother didn’t experience one. Havingtrust in local officials was not sufficient, since such actions would come frombeyond them, and irrespective of them.Deputy Flake apparently dismissed the tip as another of the many crank callslocal law enforcement agencies had been receiving over the previous five days.He didn’t ask to enter the house and left without further comment.Duane reassured my mother and sister (contradicting his own misgivings) that Iwas physically okay. We left for Phoenix. We arrived at Duane’s house in theearly morning. I went into the spare bedroom and tried to sleep. I tossed andturned, finally dozing off into a shallow sleep. My dreams were fraught withstrange, chalk white faces and huge staring eyes, and I awoke with a start.Duane came in. He told me that when I’d vanished, he had called WilliamSpaulding, of a small Phoenix-based UFO research group, Ground Saucer Watch.Duane had met Spaulding at the abduction site in the forest. At that timeSpaulding had told Duane to contact him if I should ever be returned and thathis group would supply all the medical exams and research facilities necessaryto assure my well-being and to assess the tremendous scientific implications ofthe incident. Mr. Spaulding seemed to be a competent researcher. He had alreadyissued reports of his discovery of various physical traces left by the craft atthe site.Duane first attempted to call Bill Spaulding at seven that morning, butSpaulding’s phone was unlisted. Duane finally reached him at work sometime afterseven-thirty. Mr. Spaulding was employed by the industrial plant AIResearch.Duane told Mr. Spaulding that I had been returned the night before and explainedthe need to prevent ourselves from being mobbed. Mr. Spaulding was eager to beinvolved, and inquired as to my condition. Duane told him that apparentlynothing was seriously wrong with me but a thorough medical examination should bemade anyway. Mr. Spaulding agreed enthusiastically. He directed us to a GroundSaucer Watch consultant, Dr. Lester Steward.When I rose to use the restroom, Duane had me save the first voided specimen ofurine for analysis. He had been advised by Mr. Spaulding to obtain a urinesample as early as possible for scientific testing. Spaulding had also been theone to suggest saving my clothing for forensic examination.Those warning telephone calls made by different people during the search mighthave been entirely unfounded, but Duane was taking no chances. He loyallyaccompanied me everywhere as a bodyguard during the emotionally ravaging daysfollowing my return.At about nine-fifteen that morning, Duane called Sheriff Gillespie and notifiedhim of my return. However, in keeping with his desire to shield me, he said Ihad been taken to a Tucson hospital. Soon after that we left for Dr. Steward’soffice, taking along the urine specimen in a tightly sealed jar in a brown papersack.The first indication that something was amiss was the “office building” itself.It was a derelict, musty, nearly deserted downtown hotel. We later learned ofthe hotel’s unsavory reputation. It did not seem a suitable place for arespectable doctor’s office. We were not sure we were in the right place. But wefound Dr. Steward’s name on the room roster. Confused, we took the elevator upto his floor.We were further perplexed by the sign on his office door: Dr. LesterSteward—Hypnotherapist. What? Mr. Spaulding had told us that Steward was an M.D.Our uneasiness grew, but we decided to go in, speculating that Dr. Steward mightbe an M.D. in addition to his hypnotherapy practice.Upon entering we discovered a narrow one-room office that looked out over theroof of a wing of the building, with cheap furnishings and a pair of badlyyellowed curtains covering the opened window. The window admitted enough freshair to make the lack of air-conditioning bearable. It was still early, not yetexcessively hot. Even in November, it can become uncomfortably warm during themiddle of the day in the desert city of Phoenix.Dr. Steward wasn’t even expecting us! Bill Spaulding, director of Ground SaucerWatch, had not called his consultant to inform him we were coming. Duane askedhim if he had heard about the UFO incident in the news. Steward said he had.Duane explained that we had been sent here for a medical examination by GSW.Steward reacted as if he had forgotten he was a member.Seeing no professional volumes on the shelf nor an M.D. certificate on the wall,Duane asked Steward if he was a doctor. He replied that, yes, he was, but notlicensed to practice in Arizona. When pressed on this point, he confessed he hadbeen a medic in the Marine Corps. He reluctantly explained his rights to thetitle of “Doctor” with a vague reference to a degree he had received in school.Duane asked him if he could still do the physical examination needed, suggestingblood tests and urinalysis. Duane handed Steward the jar containing my urinespecimen. Steward handed it back with a distasteful expression. He said he couldnot do any of that sort of thing because he did not at present have access tolaboratory facilities. He said he did, however, have a good friend and colleaguewho might be willing to do the exam.Only Duane’s extreme concern for my health and his desire for an immediate,thorough checkup caused him to stay at that point. I was exhausted from notsleeping the night before; my eyes were red and stinging. I sat down on a chairin front of the window, holding my head in my hands. I let Duane handle things.I was still feeling very dehydrated, and asked for a drink. Steward brought me aglass of water. I was still very thirsty and asked for another, in spite of thegreasy fingerprints all over the glass.Jets landing and taking off at the nearby airport continually passed low overthe building. “Dr.” Steward closed the window against the noise and telephonedhis colleague. The phone call was almost funny in the way it further revealedSteward’s phoniness. “Hello, Dr. So-and-so, this is Dr. Steward.” A long pause.“Dr. Lester Steward, you remember me, don’t you?” His so-called “friend andcolleague” apparently did not remember him, and refused to do the examination!Needless to say, Duane extricated us as quickly as possible and we left.I had not eaten that morning and I was very hungry. We stopped for a largebreakfast on the way home.When we arrived back at Duane’s home, I again tried to sleep. The telephone rangagain and again. Word had somehow gotten out that I had been returned, andpeople wanted to know where I was. Duane sent them on a wild-goose chase toprotect me from harassment, telling them, as he had told Gillespie, that I wasin a Tucson hospital. There were constant calls from the news media, curiouspeople, and a couple of calls from “Dr.” Steward. He had been in contact withSpaulding and was now very eager to reacquire our cooperation for GSW’sinvestigation of the case. Duane politely declined.Spaulding called later to suggest a meeting with Dr. J. Allen Hynek. Duane atfirst agreed, then changed his mind. I was still very seriously upset and didnot want to have anything to do with anybody I believed associated with GSW.Contributing to our reservations was an earlier exchange with “Dr.” Steward. InSteward’s office Duane had told him that recently it had been suggested that Dr.James Harder and Dr. Hynek be brought in. Steward had exclaimed: “Oh, no. Youwant to keep your brother away from those two, they’d really put him throughhell. They would really give him a pounding!” We wondered, Don’t these GSWpeople get together on anything?We knew so little at the time that we didn’t even recognize Dr. Hynek as anastronomer who was one of the foremost investigators in the field of ufology. Wealso later learned that he was the head of the Center for UFO Studies, anindependent research organization not directly affiliated with GSW.Shortly after our rejection of GSW, Bill Spaulding suddenly began maligning meto the media. After publicizing his on-site recorded magnetic and ozonereadings, he abruptly reversed his public stance without explaining his earlierendorsement of the case or offering new data to support his change in attitude.I don’t know if this was motivated by wounded pride, or simply a continueddesire to capitalize—one way or another—on the intense publicity surrounding theincident. “We’re going to blow this story out today!” he declared to reporters.Their inaccurate assertions were exposed by the testing subsequently carried outby APRO, the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization, of Tucson.Duane had also fended off the media by telling them I had been taken to ahospital in Tucson (although he called Sheriff Gillespie back and told him I wasrecovering in a private home in the Phoenix area). Coral Lorenzen, SecretaryTreasurer of APRO, decided to try to track me down. She checked all the Tucsonhospitals and found that no one answering my description had been admitted thatmorning. She then deduced that I was likely actually at Duane’s house, so shecalled there.Mrs. Lorenzen told Duane that my case was one of several others currently underinvestigation by APRO, and offered to provide anything possible that would be ofhelp. Duane admitted I was there but asked her not to tell the media.Sympathetic to my condition, she agreed. He told her he thought it was importantfor me to be thoroughly examined by a physician as soon as possible. Mrs.Lorenzen assured him that APRO had the capacity to conduct a professionalinvestigation and would be glad to provide an examination.Coral Lorenzen then called two reputable physicians in their Phoenix membership.One of them, Dr. Joseph Saults, was off-duty that day, so she left a messagewith his secretary for him to call back. She then reached the other doctor,Howard Kandell, at his clinic. He said he would be free at 3:30 p.m. and that heunderstood the need for confidentiality. She called Duane back and notified himthat at least one doctor would arrive at his home shortly after three-thirty.Dr. Saults called Coral back right after that. She explained the situation tohim and he agreed to make arrangements with Dr. Kandell to join him on the housecall.The doctors arrived on schedule. They agreed to Duane’s requests to confinetheir questions to my health and not use the tape recorder and camera they hadbrought. An interview would require recalling some very upsetting memories, andI needed to calm down and collect myself.They performed a thorough physical examination. The written report on the examwould be forwarded to APRO by Dr. Kandell. The doctors took the urine specimenwith them for analysis. We made arrangements for the portion of the examinationrequiring laboratory tests to be performed the following morning, November 12,at Dr. Kandell’s office.That afternoon Sheriff Gillespie called Duane and requested a meeting with me.He was understandably upset with us for not having immediately notified him ofmy return. Duane explained that I had not been capable of being interviewed andwas still too traumatized to be interrogated. Sheriff Gillespie insisted onmeeting with me so that he could officially close his missing-person report.Duane agreed to have him come alone and see me that night. Duane asked him notto inform the media of my actual whereabouts. Gillespie agreed.I was lying on the couch when he arrived late that evening. It was the firsttime I had related that much of my experience to anyone, including Duane. It wasvery upsetting. I struggled to keep from breaking down and made my answers shortso that I would have to relive the nightmare as little as possible.He did not react negatively or harshly and, except for a stern reminder of theconsequences if my report were false, he seemed sympathetic to my emotionallyfragile condition. I told Sheriff Gillespie I wanted to take a polygraph test,but that I did not want to be mobbed by curious people and reporters. Hepromised to arrange a polygraph test which the media would not know of untilafter it was completed and I had returned home. I thanked him. He leftimmediately for Holbrook.I slept fitfully that night. I tossed and turned. Nightmares woke me severaltimes during the night. I awoke the next morning feeling little better for thenight’s rest.I arrived at Dr. Kandell’s clinic very early. I weighed myself on his scales.They performed an EKG (electrocardiogram) and took X rays. Blood samples weretaken. I was sent over to the renowned Barrows Neurological Center for an EEG(electroencephalogram), a register of brain-wave patterns. The testing draggedon, consuming the entire morning.After returning home, I again tried to rest that afternoon. The telephone rangconstantly. Gillespie may have kept his word about not informing the media of mywhereabouts, but evidently someone had released the information. Reportersrepeatedly came and knocked on the door. Duane’s polite refusals necessarilygrew testier as the harassment continued to build. The local papers reacted tothese rebuffs by printing the only available comments—those from the very angryand vocal Bill Spaulding and Lester Steward.APRO’s Jim Lorenzen and other APRO scientific consultants (including the famousDr. James Harder, Professor of Civil Engineering at the University of Californiaat Berkeley, APRO’s Director of Research) were on the National Enquirer's BlueRibbon Panel for UFOs. The National Enquirer first contacted APRO at about noonon November 11, asking their opinion of the case. APRO told them it appearedgenuine so far.The Enquirer does much reporting of UFO incidents and helps sponsorinvestigation of some cases. Mrs. Lorenzen told them I was in no emotionalcondition to confront the press and should be sequestered for testing. Privacywas rapidly becoming impossible at Duane’s house. She told them that, althoughAPRO could offer the services of its scientific consultants to conduct theneeded tests, they could not assume financial responsibility for the hotelaccommodations and other expenses necessary for sequestering me. The Enquirer’srepresentative agreed to underwrite that part of the project.It was Paul Jenkins of the National Enquirer who first approached us on November13 with the proposal. Duane at first took him for just another reporter andrefused him. But Jenkins returned and explained the paper’s association withAPRO, saying that scientific testing would provide reassurance as to mycondition while granting the opportunity for research. We agreed to go to thehotel for interviewing and testing. I hoped that an exclusive with the Enquirerwould get me out of doing hundreds of interviews with other reporters.Duane and I went to the hotel, the Scottsdale Sheraton Inn, that same evening.There we met the rest of the Enquirer reporters: Jeff Wells, Nick Longhurst, andChris Fuller. Jim Lorenzen, the International Director of the Aerial PhenomenaResearch Organization, drove up from Tucson that night. He met Dr. JamesHarder’s plane and the two proceeded to the hotel where Duane and I and the crewfrom the National Enquirer were waiting for them.I had been extremely tense every waking moment since my return. When JimLorenzen and Dr. Harder entered the room, their first impression of me was of a“caged wildcat.” Dr. Harder is a skilled hypnotist, but what he accomplishedthat evening was phenomenal. The longer Dr. Harder talked, the more my tensioneased. I had been skeptical of hypnosis before, but his tremendous capacity torelax me deeply impressed me. He is a certified hypnotist of the respected LaCrone school.Dr. Harder did not attempt any deep hypnosis on me that night, as it was quitelate and he did not wish to pressure me.The next morning, November 14, Duane and I returned to his house for a change ofclothes before heading for the Department of Public Safety headquarters, whereSheriff Gillespie had arranged for a polygraph test to be taken. The DPS (statepolice) examiner, Cy Gilson, had also done the tests on my six coworkers.Just as we were leaving for the appointment, a reporter called and asked for aninterview about the upcoming polygraph test. Duane hung up the phone and saidangrily, “I smell a rat!” It appeared the sheriff had not kept his word.“To hell with it, then! I told him I didn’t want all those reporters stickingmicrophones in my face,” I ranted shakily. Our agreement had been clear. If myone request hadn’t been met, what else would I be in for? So, as I believe wasperfectly understandable under those circumstances, I did not keep theappointment.Later we saw Gilson on television, being interviewed by many reporters. Mentionwas made of my expected appearance. We didn’t know it, but Sheriff Gillespieprobably really had kept his word. The sheriff had asked Cy Gilson to keep thetests as secret as possible, but the press had been tailing Gilson that morning.(Would they have surveilled him if they hadn’t been tipped?) When Gilson noticedthis, he left by the back door at headquarters, drove randomly around thestreets and stopped for a while to make sure he lost them. But then he wentdirectly to the appointed place—the same location where he usually gave thepolygraph tests. One television station already had a crew and camera set up inan office window across the street. It seems the police had held a pressconference that morning, supposedly concerning only Gilson’s testing of theother six men, and word had leaked out from someone there about my scheduledtest.We returned to the hotel and related the turn of events. The Enquirer peoplewere not unhappy. They preferred an exclusive story anyway. They said they wouldsponsor a polygraph test from a private firm.Dr. Harder warned that any test taken now, so soon after such an ordeal waslikely to come up inconclusive at best. Dr. Harder said a polygraph measuresstress, not lies per se. The theory behind a lie detector is that peopleregister stressful physiological responses when they lie. He noted that I wasstill extremely agitated when talking about my experience. He counseled that, ifa test was performed, the results not be taken too seriously.Despite his advice, arrangements were made for a test. Dr. Harder explained thesituation to the examiner, who agreed to keep the results confidential if theyturned out as Dr. Harder anticipated. The test yielded the predicted stressfultracings, so the researchers scrapped it.Three psychiatrists brought in by the Enquirer that evening expressed theopinion that the test results were totally meaningless. Dr. Warren Gorman, Dr.Jean Rosenbaum (who has testified in court as an expert witness on thepolygraph), and his wife, Dr. Beryl Rosenbaum, all concurred on that point.Other APRO consultants also later affirmed their conclusion.After that polygraph experiment on November 15, Jean Rosenbaum stated in a pressrelease to ABC-TV News 3 of Phoenix: “Our conclusion—which is absolute—is thatthis young man is not lying—that there is no collusion involved, no attempt tohoax ... or collusion of the family or anyone else. There is a rumor around thatthere’s contracts. There are no such contracts—no motivation for a lie. Theresults of tests show this is a person who has been going through a kind of lifecrisis like we all do; for example, a death or divorce or anything of that kind.The results of psychiatric tests and hypnosis show he really believes thesethings. He is not lying.” Question: “Any possibility of lying? There’s no hoaxas you see it?”His answer: “None whatsoever, there’s no way he could have gotten around thesetests, that he could have gotten around in particular the hypnotic series thathe was under.”A long session of regressive hypnosis had been performed by Dr. Harder the nightbefore, concerning the details of my experience aboard the craft. The hypnosiswas witnessed by Dr. Kandell, Dr. Saults, Dr. Jean Rosenbaum, Dr. BerylRosenbaum, longtime associate Dr. Robert Ganelin, and also Duane and theEnquirer crew.Dr. Rosenbaum later stated he had no doubt that the hypnosis had been performedcorrectly. He noted that all signs of anxiety (eye movement, respiration, muscletension, sweat) had vanished as soon as I was put under and that all theappropriate tests for a deep trance checked out.I did not recall any experiences under hypnosis that I could not rememberbefore. Dr. Harder did, however, allow me to verbalize my experience in greaterdetail, without being overwhelmed by my heretofore clinging anxiety. It was thefirst time anyone had heard the entire account. Everyone in the room listened insilent amazement as the story of my horrible ordeal unfolded. . ."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8The AliensFear will drive men to any extreme; and the fear inspired by a superior being isa mystery which cannot be reasoned away.—George Bernard Shaw(The account heard by the roomful of scientists and reporters during thehypnosis would only appear here as a long series of gentle, probing questionsand terse responses. After I underwent the hypnoregression, I continued to beable to recall my experiences inside the craft with greatly reduced fear.Therefore, to avoid the tedium of question-and-answer form, I present theaccount in the form of a more detailed, smooth narrative.)“Uhnng ...” I moaned silently. My first glimmer of slowly returningconsciousness brought with it the single overpowering sensation of pain.“Oh, damn!” I gritted my teeth against the agony. The excruciating ache almostcaused me to lose consciousness again. Tremendous swollen, tingling sensations,centered in my head and chest, diminished in intensity downward to my feet. Ifelt badly burned, all over, even inside me. Even worse than burned: It was asif I had been broken into a hundred pieces, had been literally crushed.Oh, this damned pain! I don’t know if I can stand it! I thought desperately.I’ve got to do something! But I didn’t dare budge for fear of increasing thepain.I was lying on my back. I didn’t try to move or even to open my eyes at first. Iwas weak, so watery-weak, that I knew if I attempted to move even my arm I’dlapse back into unconsciousness. I was afraid I’d upset the balance of power inmy inner battle with the excruciating pain. Desperately I summoned all I couldmuster of the mental pain-control I had learned in karate training. Firstmanaging to hold the sensations at bay, inch by inch, I gained ground againstthe tormenting ache.That’s better! I thought with relief. I managed to put most of the pain out ofmy mind. My head was clearer and I could think a little better, but I stillneeded most of my concentration to keep the pain blocked out.A bitter, metallic taste covered my tongue. My mouth was dry and I was verythirsty. Oddly, the weakness in my muscles did not seem to come from hunger. Thetrembling felt odd, like a strange mixture of exertion and illness. I had neverhad a headache in my entire life. Something was terribly wrong.God! What happened to me? I wondered fearfully. I tried to remember. My mind wasstill somewhat groggy. I could not recall anything.I sluggishly dragged my eyelids open. I could not see anything. Then a blurredimage began to coalesce. My eyes struggled against the agony. My sight shiftedin and out of focus. My vision slowly became clearer. The hazy scintillations oflight gradually solidified into an image. I could make out some kind of lightsource above me.The fixture was a luminous rectangle about three feet by one and a half feet.The diffused light came from the flat, frosted surface of the rectangle. Thedirect light sent daggers of pain into my head. The fixture gave off a clear,soft white glow. It was not tremendously bright, but my eyes could not handleit. I winced and blinked, then shifted my gaze to the tolerable dimness beyondthe glowing rectangle.For an instant I could distinguish the brushed metal luster of a ceiling in thesofter, reflected glow above the light. The fixture seemed to be suspended lowerand closer to me than to the ceiling. I deduced from the nearness of the ceilingthat the hard flat surface I was lying on was a raised table of some kind.What’s the matter with my eyes? I asked myself. The ceiling is all crooked. It’stoo small on this end and too large on that end! Were my eyes playing tricks onme? I closed them against the discomfort, but soon opened them again to ward offthe feeling of vertigo that welled up in me. The odd-shaped ceiling was indeedas I had perceived it: generally triangular, with the base toward my feet.What a weird place! I reflected wonderingly. I had been hurt. Yeah, that was it!. . . But what? I could remember straightening up and feeling as though somebodyhad whacked me with a baseball bat.Suddenly, the memory of what happened before I’d blacked out came rushing backwith stunning impact. I remembered standing in the clearing in the woods lookingup at that glowing saucer! Good grief, what a sight! I had seen it move andheard its awesome sound. My approach had seemed to cause the thing to comealive. Then I recalled standing up and turning to get away from it. I had beenhurt somehow. . . Maybe that thing had hit me with something!Where in hell am I? . . . Oh my God—the hospital! They brought me here to thehospital! I thought.The implication gave me a sickening feeling deep down inside. Through theagonizing ache I could feel that I was at least still whole and in one piece. Ineeded to get up and find out what had happened, but I could not move. Tryingonly sapped what energy I had left. Next, I tried to call out. No sound came. Ithought I had better relax and conserve my strength. I would let the doctors doall the worrying. I was safe for now.It was very hot and humid. The heavy air was almost stifling. It smelledslightly stale and muggy. I was sweating; warm moisture beaded my temples.Feeling my jacket bunched up under my arms, I wondered why a nurse had notremoved it. I still had all my work clothes on, even my boots, and the jacketwas just too warm. I must be injured so bad there wasn’t time to take off mycoat, I thought. Maybe I was in an emergency room of some kind. Oh great, theemergency room! I must be hurt really bad! All I could do was hope for the best.Then I felt something flat pressing down lightly on my chest. It felt cool andsmooth. I looked down and managed to hold my eyes open long enough to see thatmy shirt and jacket were pushed up around my shoulders, exposing my chest andabdomen. A strange device curved across my body. It was about four or fiveinches thick and I could feel that it extended from my armpits to a few inchesabove my belt. It curved down to the middle of each side of my rib cage. Itappeared to be made of shiny, dark gray metal or plastic.I looked past the upper edge of the device. With the shift in distance my sightmomentarily blurred again. I could discern the indistinct forms of peoplestanding over me. One to the left of me, two on my right. I strained to bringthem into clearer focus. My vision was getting better. I could see the blurryfigures of the doctors, leaning over me with their white masks and caps. Theywere wearing unusual, orange-colored surgical gowns. I could not make out theirfaces clearly.My body ached, but I could not feel the doctors cutting or sewing me. I wonderedwhat they were doing and just how serious it was. I felt strong enough to move,but didn’t, for fear of causing problems for the doctors.Oh, no! I thought, my mind jumping briefly at the possibility of coming out ofanesthesia in the middle of an operation. I felt no increase in pain anddismissed the thought. That kind of stuff probably only happened in thescare-stories people pass around. I decided to conserve my energy for recovery.I had never been in a bad accident or hurt myself seriously. I had been prettyhealthy throughout my life. I had not taken so much as a single aspirin inyears. I was always careful to avoid injury of any kind. But here I had donesomething really stupid and it was too late to reconsider.Why in hell did I have to get so close? That was so dumb. If I pull out of thisone, I thought, I’ll have learned my lesson about tempering curiosity withcaution.I looked again at the vague but reassuring forms of the doctors around me.Abruptly my vision cleared. The sudden horror of what I saw rocked me as Irealized that I was definitely not in a hospital.I was looking squarely into the face of a horrible creature!My senses were instantly electrified to a new keenness. Everything clicked. Theweird-shaped room, the strange device, the odd clothing, all added up to oneinescapable conclusion: Good God! I must be inside that craft!A creature was looking steadily back at me with huge, luminous brown eyes thesize of quarters! I recoiled.I looked frantically around me. There were three of them! Hysteria overcame meinstantly. I struck out at the two on my right, hitting one with the back of myarm, knocking it into the other one. My swing was more of push than a blow, Iwas so weakened.The one I touched felt soft through the cloth of its garment. The muscles of itspuny physique yielded with a sponginess that was more like fat than sinew. Thecreature was light and had fallen back easily.I heaved myself to a sitting position. The exertion caused beads of sweat to popout on my forehead. I lunged unsteadily to my feet and staggered back. I fellagainst a utensil-arrayed bench that followed the curve of one wall. My arm sentsome of the instruments clattering against the back of the shelf. I leaned thereheavily, keeping my eyes riveted on those horrid entities.My action had caused the device across my chest to crash to the floor. No wiresor tubes connected it to me, or to anything else. It rocked back and forth onits upper side. The rocking sent shifting beams of greenish light out onto thefloor, from the underside of the machine.My aching body would not do what I told it to. My legs felt too weak to hold meup. I leaned heavily on the counter. The monstrous trio of humanoids startedtoward me. Their hands reached out at me.With the superhuman effort of a cornered animal, I ground out the strength todefend myself. Fighting the splitting pain in my skull, I grabbed for somethingfrom the bench with which to fend them off. My hand seized on a thin transparentcylinder about eighteen inches long. It was too light to be an effective club. Ineeded something sharp. I tried to break the tip off the tube. I smashed the endof the glasslike wand down on the waist-high metal slab I had been lying on. Itwould not break.I sprang into a fighting stance with my legs spread wide to brace for theattack. I lashed out with the weapon at the advancing creatures, screamingdesperate, hysterical threats. “Get away from me! What are you?” I shoutedwildly, shrinking away in revulsion.The creatures slowed but continued toward me, their hands outstretched.“Keep back, damn you!” I shrieked menacingly.They halted. In a snarling crouch I held the tube threateningly back behind myhead. I felt hopelessly trapped. I was surrounded, with my back to the wall.There was a door beyond where the nightmarish beings stood. To get out I wouldhave to go through them. It was a standoff. I crouched slightly on my tremblinglegs, the cold sweat pouring off me. My clammy grip on the rod was too feeble tolend me much reassurance, but I kept it drawn back in readiness. My mind was awhirling confusion of terror.Silence hung heavily over the room. The taut emotions practically crackled inthe air, like electricity. The creatures stood silently staring at me. I couldhardly bear to look upon them, but I got my first good look.They stood still, mutely. They were a little under five feet in height. They hada basic humanoid form: two legs, two arms, hands with five digits each, and ahead with the normal human arrangement of features. But beyond the outline, anysimilarity to humans was terrifyingly absent.Their thin bones were covered with white, marshmallowy-looking flesh. They hadon single-piece coverall-type suits made of soft, suedelike material, orangishbrown in color. I could not see any grain in the material, such as cloth has. Infact, their clothes did not appear even to have any seams. I saw no buttons,zippers, or snaps. They wore no belts. The loose billowy garments were gatheredat the wrists and perhaps the ankles. They didn’t have any kind of raised collarat the neck. They wore simple pinkish tan footwear. I could not make out thedetails of their shoes, but they had very small feet, about a size four by ourmeasure.When they extended their hands toward me, I noticed they had no fingernails.Their hands were small, delicate, without hair. Their thin round fingers lookedsoft and unwrinkled.Their smooth skin was so pale that it looked chalky, like ivory. The skin wasdelicate and thin to the point of translucence. That subtle semitransparencymade the life fluids just underneath the skin falsely suggest moistness of thesurface, contrasting its actual dryness. The thin white membrane stretched overthe curves of their small bodies, without wrinkles. The bends of their fingersand necks made very small, slightly rounded folds instead of sharp creases.Their bald heads were disproportionately large for their puny bodies. They hadbulging, oversized craniums, a small jaw structure, and an undevelopedappearance to their features that was almost infantile. Their thin-lipped mouthswere narrow; I never saw them open. Lying close to their heads on either sidewere tiny crinkled lobes of ears. Their miniature rounded noses had small ovalnostrils.The only facial feature that didn’t appear underdeveloped were those incredibleeyes! Those glistening orbs had brown irises twice the size of those of a normalhuman eye’s, nearly an inch in diameter! The iris was so large that even partsof the pupils were hidden by the lids, giving the eyes a certain catlikeappearance. There was very little of the white part of the eye showing. They hadno lashes and no eyebrows.The occasional blink of their eyes was strikingly conspicuous. Their huge lidsslid quickly down over the glassy bubbles of their eyes, then flipped open againlike the release of roll-up windowshades. These huge, moist, lashless eyes andthe milky translucence of their skin made their appearance slightly reminiscentof a cave salamander. But, strangely, in spite of my terror, I felt there wasalso something gentle and familiar about them. It hit me. Their overall look wasdisturbingly like that of a human fetus!Their sharp gaze alternately darted about, then fixed me with an intense stare—alook so piercing it seemed they were seeing right through me. I felt naked andexposed under their scrutiny. I could not bear to meet their gaze, but I foundmy eyes continually returning to look into theirs. It was impossible to avoidtheir compelling stare. Those eyes were the creepiest, most frightening things Ihad seen in my entire life.I’ve got to get out of here! My mind seized on that one driving, panickedthought. I had to get away from those awful monsters, away from those horrideyes! I felt desperate to escape. Desperate to return to the open forest that Ierroneously thought must be somewhere just outside this stifling place.With all the screaming and the hysterical questions I had thrown at them, theynever once said anything to me. I did not hear them speak to each other. Theirmouths never made any kind of sound or motion. The only sounds I heard werethose of movements, and of my own voice.Those three silent beings were between me and the only apparent way out. Withthe instincts of a trapped beast, I gathered every ounce of energy I had, tofight for my life.It looked as though those years of karate training were about to pay off.Although I couldn’t for sure know what sort of adversary I was up against, therewas nothing particularly formidable about the aliens in the sense ofhand-to-hand combat. Still, I knew that an unknown opponent could hold manysurprises.What am I going to do? I thought wildly. I did not know what kind of combinationof punching or kicking techniques to throw. My dilemma was like that of a womanneeding to brash a huge hairy spider off her arm, but too loath to touch it tomove.If I can, I’ll just push them out of the way and run past them . . . but thethought of touching them is so revolting! I groaned inwardly. I didn’t have theslightest idea of what they were capable of doing to me—they could be carryinghidden weapons, or even be venomous, or something weird like that. I only knew Ihad to get out of there, and get away from them, at any cost, even though theprospect of battling my way past them was utterly terrifying.Just as I girded myself to spring at them, they abruptly turned and scurriedfrom the room! They went out the open door, turned right and disappeared. Theanticlimax of their retreat was incredible. The extra adrenaline that hadsquirted into my bloodstream left me trembling uncontrollably. I collapsed backagainst the bench, struggling to slow my racing heart. I gulped the heavy air inragged gasps.Slowly I began to recover. Breathing deeply, I looked around me. I was in anirregular room with metal walls. The floor and ceiling were shaped like a sliceof pie with the point bitten off. The ceiling was about seven feet high. Threeof the walls were each about twelve feet in length. Two of these were straightwith a concave one between. The two straight walls were not parallel butintersected another smaller, convexly curved wall, about eight feet wide, on theother end. In it an open doorway gaped, about three feet by six and a half feet.The metal of the walls had a textured, gray matte appearance, dull andnonreflective. I saw no bolts, rivets, screws, or seams of any kind. Thesurfaces of the walls, floor, and ceiling curved into each other. Even the lightfixture, the curving bench, and the table, simply curved into the surface towhich they were attached. In fact, everything seemed to be molded out of asingle, continuous piece of material!The room was devoid of ornamentation or color. There were no windows orventilation openings. I noticed no cupboards, closets, or other doors. Icouldn’t see any buttons, switches, or electrical receptacles on the walls. Thesmall room contained only the light fixture, the table, the narrow counter Ileaned on, and the device that had fallen off my chest.The device had quit rocking back and forth by now. It lay next to the table. Theodd glow still came from under its edges. It had hit the floor with a loud noisebut, curiously, the floor had not clanged or rung with the impact. For a metalroom, the acoustics seemed quite abnormal: flat and without echo. The floor andtable only thudded deeply when I stepped on or struck the surfaces. The metalseemed to be very thick and dense.The table I had been lying on was a slab, about an inch and a half thick andapproximately three feet by six and a half feet in length. Its single round leg,about four inches in diameter, curved into the floor like a stem.The light was similarly suspended by a single descending two-inch column thatcurved into the surfaces of the ceiling and the fixture like a stalactiteformation.Afraid of the aliens’ return, I looked toward the door. No sign of anyone. Ineeded something better to defend myself with. I glanced around the room. Inoticed an array of strange instruments lying on the bench. The bench was abouteighteen inches wide and an inch and a half thick. Its edges were rounded offsmoothly. It was made of that same odd gray metallic substance.The instruments were arranged near the middle of the bench, leaving either endof it clear. There was nothing I recognized, but some of the chromelike objectsreminded me of those in a laboratory or doctor’s office. They were shiny strips,rippled, or twisted, formed into separate implements.There was a variety of transparent tubes or cylinders in different sizes,similar to the one I was still clutching. There were also some black rectangularobjects and something that looked like half of a slightly flattened,cream-colored handball with a sharp thin metal disc sticking out from thestraight side. All the objects were too small to be effective as weapons. Therewas nothing that I could defend myself with. I was more afraid of being hurt bysome of those instruments. I touched nothing more, throwing the clear tube Istill held down on the floor.Thinking I had heard a sound, I whirled, jerking my head around and riveting myeyes on the door. Again there was nothing.Oh no! What if they come back here with weapons or reinforcements? I thoughtwildly. I’d better find a way out!Stepping over the device that had been on my chest, I went around the table andstumbled to the door. I halted in the opening. I took a deep breath. I felt alittle stronger, but pain still hammered relentlessly in my head, and especiallyin my chest. I was sweating; the heavy air was difficult to breathe.I’ve got to get out of here, I thought frantically with a surge ofdetermination.There was a curving hallway about three feet wide outside the door. The ceilingof the hall gave off a faint, almost unnoticeable illumination. I looked to theright down the narrow, dimly lit passage in the direction the aliens had run.There was no one in sight.Seeing nothing in the passage to my left, I began walking that way. I broke intoa frightened run down the narrow corridor.I have to find a way out of here, I thought again. My panic was almostclaustrophobic.The cramped hallway turned continuously in a tight curve to the right. I dashedpast an open doorway on my left without looking in, only ten feet down the hallfrom the door I had just exited. I caught a glimpse of a room, but was afraid tostop.Wait just a damn minute, Travis! I struggled to get a grip on my self-control.What if I’d missed a chance at that doorway to find a way out of this place? Istill did not know for sure where in hell I was. I could be in a boat, abuilding, or a submarine for all I knew. I saw another doorway ten more feetahead on my right. I slowed down to a walk as I neared it.Maybe this would be my way out. . ."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9Human?O, the difference of man and man!—ShakespeareThe door was only a few feet ahead on my right, on the inside curve of thehallway. I slowed down, turned, and stopped in the opening.I looked in cautiously. I saw a round room about sixteen feet across with adomed ceiling about ten feet high. Equally spaced around the room were threerectangular outlines resembling closed doorways.No one there. The room was totally empty except for a single chair that facedaway from me.I looked behind me. The hallway was still empty. I slowly entered the room. Ihesitated to approach the high-backed chair. There might be somebody sitting init that I could not see from behind.I circled, keeping my distance from the chair, checking to see if anyone wassitting in it. I followed the curve of the wall to get around to where I couldsee. I was ready to beat an instant retreat if I should see one of those hideouscreatures again. I stopped every few steps to crane my neck over the back of thechair. Seeing nobody, I continued around to where I could ascertain, with muchrelief, that the chair was unoccupied.It seemed to be made of the same dull gray metal was almost everything else. Ithad a single leg that curved into the floor like the leg of the table in thefirst room. The chair was angular, with rounded edges. There were some buttonsand a strange lever on the arm of it.Glancing apprehensively toward the open door, I slowly went toward the chair. AsI gradually approached it, a very curious thing began to happen.The closer I got to it, the darker the room became! Small points of light becamevisible on, or through, the walls, even the floor. I stepped back and the effectdiminished. I stepped forward and it increased again, the points of lightbecoming brighter in contrast to the darkening background. It was like the starscoming into view in the evening, only very much faster. The matte gray of themetal wall just faded out to be replaced by the glinting, speckled deep-black ofspace.I thought: Maybe this is a planetarium-type projection or. . . Good grief! Whatif this is actually some kind of a viewing screen showing where this thing I’min is?Space. Maybe it wasn’t like the stars coming into view at night—maybe it was thestars, in the eternal void of space! I was suddenly gripped with the icy fearthat even if I could find a way outside, I would die in the airlessness ofspace. My God, the sweet earth could be millions of miles away!I could see no constellations I recognized among the myriad points of light.Even if I could find a door or a hatch, I might be trapped!. . . No. . . No! Ihoped and prayed it was not true. There just had to be a way out!I looked at the controls on the chair. Maybe—just maybe—one of those buttonswould open a door or something. I moved closer and studied the array ofswitches. On the left arm, there was a single short thick lever with an oddlymolded handle atop some dark brown material. On the right arm, there was anilluminated, lime-green screen about five inches square. Under that, a square ofapproximately twenty-five colored buttons. I looked for symbols or written wordsand found none.The screen had a lot of black lines on it that intersected each other at allangles. The lines had short little dashes intersecting them at regularintervals. On some of the lines, the dashes were widely spaced; on others, therewere many closely-spaced dashes. The buttons below the screen were arranged inabout five vertical rows, with one color for each row: red, yellow, green, blue,and violet. The colors were bright, lit faintly from within.The experiment I was considering was risky, but I was desperate. I reached out,my finger hovering over one of the green buttons uncertainly. On impulse, I wentahead and pushed it. I looked around the room and listened carefully—nothinghappened. When I pushed the button, I noticed that the segmented lines on thescreen had moved.I recklessly pushed another green one. The lines rapidly changed angles, sliddown each other, then stopped. I pushed some of the other colored buttons.Nothing happened. Nothing moved and no sound could be heard. Trembling, I satdown on the hard, slightly-curved surface of the chair.This put the short lever on my left. I put my hand onto its molded T-grip. Thelever was about an inch in diameter. The chocolate-brown handle was slightlysmall for my hand. The whole chair seemed a little too small.From where I sat, I could see stars all around me, even on the wall where I hadjust come through the door. The surfaces of the room were only faintly visible,but the doorway I had come through was as clear to see as ever.I could see nebulous clouds of tiny stars and dust in a band like the Milky Way,only more distinct than I had ever seen it on a clear night in the woods. Exceptfor the door, the effect was like sitting in a chair in the middle of space.\"Well, here goes,” I said to myself. I rotated the handle of the lever forward,feeling the slow, even, fluid resistance of it. I felt suddenly disoriented asthe stars began moving downward in front of me, in unison. Quickly I pulled myhand off the lever. The stars stopped moving. The handle slowly returned to itsoriginal position. The stars did not return to their original position, however,but remained where they were.Damn! Something has to work! I clung to that one shred of hope like a drowningman.Overcoming the momentary giddiness, I again grabbed the handle. Impulsively, Imoved the handle in a series of different directions. The handle seemed torotate independently of the lever when I rolled it forward or to the sides. Thestars began whirling and changing directions wildly in response to the lever’smovements. But the stars always retained the same pattern in their motions. Ipulled my hand away from the lever and it returned to its original verticalposition. The stars again regained the position they’d held when I released mygrip on the handle.If this thing is flying, I could crash it or throw it off course and get lost orsomething! I worried. What if it just exploded? I resolved not to tamper withthose controls anymore. I might escalate a desperate situation into a fataldisaster.I got out of the chair and walked to the edge of the room. As I did, the starsfaded out and the surfaces of the wall, ceiling, and floor came into sight. Imoved over to one of the rectangles resembling closed doors. I searched theedges for a sign of a switch or an opening mechanism. Seeing none, I ran myhands along the edges of the crack. I could not feel any draft through it I putmy eye to the crack; I could not see any light, either. I looked around for somekind of symbol or writing that would help me figure out where I was or how toget out of there. None.I walked back to the chair and stood beside it, looking at the buttons. Therewere some I had not yet pushed. I was thinking about pushing some of them, whenI heard a faint sound.I whirled around and looked at the door. There, standing in the open doorway,was a human being!I stood frozen to the spot. He was a man about six feet two inches tall. Hishelmeted head barely cleared the doorway. He was extremely muscular and evenlyproportioned. He appeared to weigh about two hundred pounds. He wore atight-fitting bright blue suit of soft material like velour. His feet werecovered with black boots, a black band or belt wrapped around his middle. Hecarried no tools or weapons on his belt or in his hands; no insignia marked hisclothing.Wow! How did he get here? Is he from the air force? What’s going on here? Maybehe’s from NASA! I’m saved! Another human—one of my own kind! Relief flooded overme. Never before had I been so glad to see a total stranger.The man gestured with his right hand for me to come toward him. He beckoned withhis open hand.I ran up to him, exclaiming, babbling all sorts of questions. “How did you getin here? Can you get me out of here? There were these horrible things in here. .. What’s going on? Who are you? Please, help me!”The man remained silent throughout my verbal barrage. I was worried by hissilence. I looked closely at his face through the helmet.He had coarse, sandy-blond hair of medium length, covering his ears. He had adark complexion, like a deep, even tan. He had no beard or mustache. In fact, Icouldn’t even see stubble or dark shadow of whiskers. He had slightly rugged,masculine features and strange eyes. They were a bright, golden hazel color—butthere was something odd about those eyes besides their color that I could notquite identify.His helmet was like a transparent sphere, slightly flattened. No tubes or hoses.Its wide black rim was set down close over the contour of his shoulder. Theblack rim had a small oval opening in it in the back. The helmet might have beenlightly frosted on the back, or it might have been just the lighting that madeit appear that way.The man did not offer any acknowledgment of my questions. He only smiled kindlyin a faintly tolerant manner. He didn’t appear to even be attempting to reply.Then it hit me: That’s it! Of course he can’t answer with that helmet on. Heprobably can’t even hear me!He took me firmly but gently by the left arm and gestured for me to go with him.He seemed friendly enough. He probably just wanted to get someplace where hecould remove his helmet. His need for the helmet made me somewhat uneasy. MaybeI’d better go with him, the sooner to get out of this air—which, even if it’snot harmful, is stiflingly warm and humid. Anyway, he’s too big to argue with. Iwas anxious to have all my questions answered, but I figured everything would beexplained when we got to where we were going. For the moment, I was relievedmerely to be in the company of a real human being. I knew one thing for sure: IfI could get mm of here and away from where those aliens lurked, I was going tocooperate.He took me out of that room and hurried me down the narrow hallway, pulling mealong behind him due to its narrowness. The hallway continued to curve to ourright. He stopped in front of a closed doorway that slid open to his right, intothe wall. I did not see what caused it to open.The door opened into a bare room so small it was more like a foyer or section ofhallway, although it was slightly wider than the hall we had just left. The doorslid shut quickly and silently behind us. Again I attempted to talk the man aswe stood there.Where are we going?” I asked anxiously.No answer.We spent approximately two minutes in the metal cubicle, no more than seven byfive by twelve feet. Then a doorway, the same size as the other door anddirectly opposite it, slid open, also to the right.The brilliant warm light that came through the opening door into the airlocklikeroom was almost like daylight in color and brightness. Fresh, cool air waftedin, reminding me of springtime in the out-of-doors, making me realize just howdark and stifling that place had been. What a relief that fresh air was!The side walls of the passage outside the door sloped down at aforty-five-degree angle to meet a ramp that continued its slope. While my eyesbecame accustomed to the bright light, I stood on the landing for a moment. Theair moved around me in a softly fluctuating current. I stood and inhaled deeplythe clean, cool breeze. The last twinges of the ache in my head and chest almostcompletely disappeared. I had nearly forgotten the discomfort that had been withme constantly since I had regained consciousness.I looked around to discover that, although I was outside that dim, humid craft Iwas not out-of-doors. I was in a huge room. The ceiling was sectioned intoalternating rectangles of dark metal and those that gave off light like the sunshining through a translucent panel. The alternation of the light and darkpanels reminded me of a checkerboard. The ceiling itself curved to form one ofthe larger walls in the room. The room was shaped like one-quarter of a cylinderlaid on its side.I descended the short, steep ramp seven or eight feet to the floor. The rampseemed as if it would be difficult to walk down at the angle it descended, butit turned out to be floored with a very sure gripping, rubber-like surface.The outside of the craft we had just left was shaped like the one we had seen inthe woods, like two pie pans placed lip to lip with a dome on top. but was verymuch larger, about sixty feet in diameter and sixteen feet high. It did not emitlight; instead it had a surface of shiny brushed-metal luster. It seemed toradiate a faint heat from its hull. The craft either sat flat on its bottom or,if it had legs, they were only a few inches high. It sat nearly in the middle ofthe large room.On my left, toward one end of the large room, there were two or three ovalshapedsaucers, reflecting light like highly polished chrome. I saw beyond the edge ofthe brushed-metal craft a silvery reflection that could have been another shiny,rounded craft. I could see two of them very clearly. against the wall at the endof the hangarlike room. They were about forty or forty-five feet in diameter,quite a bit smaller than the angular vehicle I had just come out of. I saw noprojections or breaks in the smooth, shiny, flattened spheres. They sat on veryrounded bottoms and I could not see how they balanced that way. Perhaps theywere braced or attached in some way to the wall behind them.The man escorted me across the open floor to a door. The dull green floor seemedto be made of a springy, semihard rubbery pavement, somewhat similar to thematerial of an indoor track.The doors opened silently and quickly from the middle outward. We were in ahallway about six feet wide, illuminated from the eight-foot-high ceiling, whichwas one long panel of softly diffused light. The walls were a pastel off-green,the floor was the same carpetlike soft pavement of the large room we had justleft. The hallway was straight and perhaps eighty feet long. Closed double doorswere distributed along the corridor.“When do I get to go home?” I asked. “Where are we going now?”No reply.At the end of the hallway, another pair of double doors. I watched closely thistime. I did not see him touch anything, but again the doors slid silently backfrom the middle. We entered a white room approximately fifteen fee: square, withanother eight-foot-high ceiling. The room had a table and a chair in it. But myinterest was immediately focused on the three other humans!Two men and a woman were standing around the table. They were all wearingvelvety blue uniforms like the first man’s, except that they had no helmets. Theuniforms were cuffless and collarless. They fit very tightly or. the upper bodyand upper legs, slightly looser on the lower legs. The pant legs tucked looselyinto or were attached to the short boottops. The boots were made of a soft, dullblack material. Neither the boots nor the bar. around the waist appeared to bemade of leather. The boots did not have a hard sole; they were more likemoccasins. A seam or a line in the material of their uniforms ran from themiddle of the neckline down to the waist. There was no buckle on the band aroundthe middle, no weapons or tools on the band. They also wore no insignia.The two men had the same muscularity and the same masculine good looks as thefirst man. The woman also had a face and figure that was the epitome of hergender. They were smooth-skinned and blemishless. No moles, freckles, wrinkles,or scars marked their skin. The striking good looks of the man I had first metbecame more obvious on seeing them all together. They shared a family-likeresemblance, although they were not identical.They all had the same coarse, brownish blond hair. The woman wore hers longerthan the men, past her shoulders. She did not appear to be wearing makeup. Theyall seemed to be in their mid-twenties, perhaps older. All had those sameintense, golden hazel eyes. Whether it was their brightness or some otherquality, something was definitely odd about those eyes; but I could not pin downtheir disturbing nature. Their most encouraging feature, other than appearinghuman, was that they wore no helmets. Maybe they could hear me! Instantly Istarted talking to them, trying to get them to answer.“Would somebody please tell me where I am?” I implored. I was still utterlyshaken from my encounter with those awful other creatures. “What in hell isgoing on? What is this place?”They didn’t answer me. They only looked at me, though not unkindly. The helmetedman sat me down in a chair. He crossed the room to a door and, when it opened,went out. There was a corridor outside the door; he turned right.The chair he had seated me in was soft and comfortable. It was upholstered witha close-grained, or weaveless, tan fabric. It was squared off, but the sidesangled so that the bottom was smaller than the top. It had no legs; the back wasrounded. It stood to the right of the door through which I had just entered.The table was a shiny black slab with a single silvery leg about six inches indiameter. It stood midway across the room, was about seven feet by three and ahalf feet across, and two inches thick, with rounded edges and corners.One man and the woman came around the table, approaching me. They stood oneither side of the chair.“What are you doing?” I asked.Silently they each took me by an arm and led me toward the table. I didn’t knowwhy I should cooperate with them. They wouldn’t even tell me anything. But I wasin no position to argue, so I went along at first.They lifted me easily onto the edge of the table. I became wary and startedprotesting. “Wait a minute. Just tell me what you are going to do!”I began to resist them, but all three began pushing me gently backward down ontothe table. I looked up at the ceiling, covered with panels of softly glowingwhite light with a faint blue cast.I saw that the woman suddenly had an object in her hand from out of nowhere—itlooked like one of those clear, soft plastic oxygen masks, only there were notubes connected to it. The only thing attached to it was a small blackgolfballsized sphere.She pressed the mask down over my mouth and nose. I started to reach up to pullit away. Before I could complete the motion, I rapidly became weak. Everythingstarted turning gray. Then there was nothing at all but black oblivion.Consciousness returned to me on the night I awoke to find myself on the coldpavement west of Heber, Arizona."},{"pageContent":"PART 2Analysis"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10A Question of BeliefRead not to contradict and confute, nor to believe and take for granted, but toweigh and consider.—Sir Francis BaconIn opening this book I included a discussion of bias and the need for an openmind in judging the validity of our (mine and my coworkers’) experience with theUFO. Due to the unique and incredible nature of that experience, I feel thatmany of the questions asked are perfectly justifiable and appropriate. But whenanswers to those questions are arrived at without fair examination of all theevidence, I strenuously object. I maintain that if all the evidence had beenanalyzed with an open mind, none of the various wild accusations against mycoworkers and me ever would have been made. Anyone unwilling to examine relevantevidence is really not justified in forming an opinion about anything.While nearly everyone was prematurely making up their minds whether we were saneor crazy, truthful or lying, the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO)went quietly about its business of assessing the validity of the case from ascientific standpoint. APRO performed an extensive battery of medical,psychiatric, hypnotic, and polygraph examinations which, with other evidence andthe physical facts of the case, expose all the accusations as unjustified.When I step back and take a look at all the attacks made on the veracity of myincident over the years, I am disturbed by the simple fact that some of thisstuff was ever judged fit to print. To be fair, I have encountered someexcellent journalists, even some who were skeptical, who did their best toverify their facts and present an objective, balanced view; the ones who didn’tjust pretend to leave conclusions to the reader while actually making their own.Objectivity is the standard I have come to feel I should strive for.I used to be offended, even outraged, not just at false “evidence,” but atdisbelief itself. I now realize that a certain degree of disbelief is perfectlyunderstandable; after all, people are trying to judge a truly incredible reportin what I frankly acknowledge is an absence of indisputable proof. Therefore, inreviewing these issues, I will play devil’s advocate in places. Rather than say,“This ain’t so ’cause I was there and I know how it really was,” I will try totake what is (for someone in my place) the more difficult position: one thatconsiders, rather than automatically dismisses, negative “evidence,” at leastfor purposes of discussion. I’ll try to present what is needed for an objectiveoutsider to conduct an informed evaluation.I enter this area of discussion with mixed feelings because here, in the midstof finally having my own say, I’m inadvertently providing an extended forum forstatements by others that should never have been made in the first place.There is a post-Watergate mentality that assumes that public denials (or evenallegations alone) are in themselves evidence of wrongdoing. It’s become soroutine to hear trusted public officials make denials of things we later learnare true, that we have nearly come to treat denials as confessions. Thissituation leads many accused public figures to use the tactic of avoidingcomment altogether, even when being truthful. Not me. I’m no longer going to letthis litany of innuendo, this tissue of lies and ad hoc assumptions, dominatethe floor unchallenged.One thing I’ve learned about the media is that the retraction usually gets asmaller hearing than the original error, if the retraction gets heard at all.Besides wondering how such baseless attacks can make it into print, I am furtherannoyed at how things already disproved keep being recycled over the years. Notonly were a lot of the allegations indisputably refuted long ago, they had beenabsurd right from the start. As I will demonstrate, a moment’s thought wouldhave immediately removed a lot of this stuff from consideration.The credentials and credibility, methods and motives, of my advocates weremicroscopically scrutinized while those of my detractors went unchallenged. Ifeven a fraction of the skepticism applied against me and my proponents had beenapplied to the naysayers, their campaign would have ended even as it began.One misconception is so common it warrants being ranked as a classic logicalfallacy: the belief that if there are so many different attacks heard so manytimes from so many different sources, there must be some validity to them. Thetruth, of course, is that a billion falsehoods told a billion times by a billionpeople are still false.What makes this reasoning especially illogical is when the various allegationsstarkly contradict each other. The most fundamental test of validity is the lawof contradiction—i.e., a thing cannot be both A and not A. It is irrational totake a collection of theories that are mutually exclusive and act as if they addup and give weight to each other. Yet my foremost critics do exactly that. Oneman even said that it was a hoax and a drug hallucination in one breath!Logically speaking, not only does a collection of incompatible accusations nothave compounding strength, each cancels the others so that the collection hasless merit than any one would have if made alone.This observation is especially true when many disparate allegations are putforth by a single individual. Why? Because it becomes apparent that the accuseris not moved by the force of evidence for a specific theory, but instead by somemotive preceding his flurry of tactics. Which brings up the question: Just whatis his real motive?Ironically, when one’s foremost detractor makes an internally inconsistentscattergun assault, he is actually making a perverse sort of endorsement,because it is clear the detractor himself doesn’t believe that any one of hisattacks has sufficient merit to stand alone. He rather refutes his own positionand impugns his own motives. Like the Bard says, “Methinks he doth protest toomuch.”But still, we have this hail of disparagement against what has otherwise beenacclaimed by the top people in the field as the most proven, best documentedcase of alien abduction in the history of scientific ufology. So what is itabout this incident that drew so much fire? Could it have simply been a naturalreaction to the bizarreness of the report? I’ve seen my experience criticallydissected in a magazine alongside a sympathetic, credulous report of bare claimsof attacks by gigantic birds which offered no multiple witnesses, no polygraphtests, no physical evidence, virtually no documentation at all.Don’t misunderstand. There were many people who never doubted the reality of thestory and many news reports gave unbiased accounts. But on the other hand,others put forth absolutely every conceivable alternative explanation. Attemptsto explain it all away had a predictable, knee-jerk correlation to thenaysayer’s field of specialty. To lawmen our report was a cover story formurder. To some newsmen it was a publicity stunt. To a substance-abuse worker,the best way to dismiss it was an alcohol or drug hallucination. To a geologist,the craft became escaping underground gases or ball lightning generated by platetectonics. To religious fanatics it had to be either Satan’s minions in disguiseor fiery chariots of the gods. To an atheist/humanist it was the result ofquasireligious UFO fanaticism of “true believers.” To astronomers the easyalternative was a misidentified planet. One psychiatrist explained it aschildhood mental trauma culminating in a “transitory psychosis.” And to a UFO“debunker,” it was most of these, simultaneously! (Readers will notice that Iput “debunker” in quotation marks. That is because the people I refer to don’tso much remove bunk as create it.) As I shall show, these various theories areat complete odds with each other and, more importantly, at complete odds withbasic, easily verified facts.It’s almost as if people were saying, Anything but that! No matter howfarfetched, ad hoc, or poor-fitting the evidence—anything but that! What theheck was going on here? Could it have been backlash to what was seen as achallenge to an accustomed and comfortable worldview? Granted, the astoundingnature of the incident could partially justify reactions, but the desperategrasping for alternative explanations which transpired really went beyond eventhat.I believe I’ve isolated several contributing factors to why things turned soinexplicably negative. The causes comprise six main areas. I’ve alreadymentioned one: tenacious defense of long-held beliefs. The other five areas areordinary fear (which need not be explained), ufologists’ rivalry, mediafallibility, human susceptibility, and the debunkers’ obsession. Through thesefactors runs the common thread of conformity.My ignorance of the field let me walk unsuspecting into the crossfire of along-raging rivalry among ufologists. In November 1976 Jesse Kornbluth publishedan article, “The Ufologist Establishment,” slamming the people and organizationsin the field of UFO studies, using my experience as the football for hiskickoff. Of my return he wrote:. . . Travis was abducted again, this time by the Ufologist Establishment . . .groups that have space-agey acronymic code names which read like NASA parodies.. . APRO . . . NICAP. . . MUFON. . . NUFONIN. And like the official spaceagency, the UFO Establishment has superstars: Dr. J. Allen Hynek, “the Pope ofUfology” who was for twenty years the Air Force consultant on UFOs, andphysicist Stanton Friedman, “the Ralph Nader of UFOs” . . . Travis Walton neverhad a chance against this crew . . . he ended up getting devoured by thesesupposedly friendly forces. . . Poor Travis. Nice kid but not too clever when itcomes to the nitty-gritty of UFO politicking. . . What Travis didn’t realize,however, is that he was little more than a piece of prize booty in a bizarreintraorganizational war, and that flying saucers had nothing to do with it.When I first read the article I was incensed by its untruths, its mockery myexperience. The loyalty I felt to APRO for all they had done for me increased myanger. I wrote a sizzling (but never-sent) letter of rebuttal. However I nowrealize there is some truth to the part I’ve quoted here, with two reservations:the inclusion of Stanton Friedman, and my belief that MUFON handled thesituation pretty well, given the circumstances—lack of information from themedia, and incorrect information from GSW.I believe that mine would have been considered an exceptionally valid by any oneof those organizations—if that organization had been the one to get primary, oreven better—exclusive—access to the investigation. However, whetherdeliberately, unconsciously, or unintentionally due to media misinformation,those more excluded tended to take the more skeptical stance.That last sentence is a vast understatement in the case of GSW, Ground SaucerWatch. Spaulding had never even met me or any of the six witnesses. Hispseudoscientific “bafflegab” was riddled with linguistic malapropisms and nonsequiturs, but it was eagerly received by an information-starved press. I wasdeclining all requests for interviews, and nature abhors a vacuum. The powerfulvacuum generated by my silence had the unfortunate side effect of inflating aminor figure into the only available source regarding a major ongoing newsstory.The fourth cause of the negative reactions is media fallibility. In thecompetition for the “scoop” and the mad dash to meet deadlines, no time sallowed to check credentials or verify even basic facts—especially in the midstof a media feeding frenzy. And a little blood in the water can drasticallytransform a mild-mannered reporter. Once a negative treatment is adopted, manyreporters succumb to a mob mentality, following in unison the swell of changingdirection like a school of barracuda. To put it bluntly, they crib—copy eachother. Instead of initiating their own inquiries, they unquestioningly use theircolleagues’ previous reports as foundation for their own. They read each otherand call it research. People who just “go with the flow” should be morecareful—someone may have just flushed the toilet.The fifth factor causing the fallout, human susceptibility, refers to thebehavior of people in and around the event. That event generated such intenseemotional feelings in everyone involved that I am amazed so many skepticaltheories were based upon observations of people acting at variance with whatthey expected would be “normal” behavior. In the midst of excitement so intense,pressure so high, a mix of variables so complex and circumstances so bizarre,how can anyone hold preconceived notions about what a natural reaction would be?Being the focus of all this gives me a unique perspective, from which I can, inretrospect, venture an analysis of some common threads running through themotivations of people near the epicenter.An earth-shaking event suddenly interrupts everyone’s mundane lives, and,temporarily suspending ordinary concerns, creates a mixture of an “air ofemergency” anxiety and a “school’s out” carnival atmosphere. Combinesimultaneously uncertainty and undeniability, stir in heaping measures of suddenshock, fear, strangeness, suspicion, and lost sleep, and the whole scene beginsto take on an unreal quality. Anyone who doesn’t live here might not be able toappreciate just how overwhelming all this upheaval was for such a serenelyconservative little rural town where kids complain that “nothing ever happens.”Even more than this, though, is that when all this fervor is focused on oneindividual, when everyone is aware that everyone else’s excitement and attentionis concentrated on one person, one very distinct reaction results: People actalmost compulsively somehow to find some way to thrust themselves into as directof a connection as possible with that central person.Such behavior is not confined to lone, star-obsessed late-twenties males or toscreaming teenage rock groupies. This is a powerful phenomenon affecting everydemographic group, professionals included. People you would never expect begindoing some very unexpected things. And this “connection forging” can be negativeor positive in nature, depending on where that person finds himself relative tothe center of it all.So I got people with whom I had a rather cool relationship claiming we wereclose friends, people I’ve never met claiming to know me personally as ascoundrel or a saint, a number of girls falsely claiming they were pregnant byme, a guy I once boxed claiming he knocked me out, people trying to take charge,exaggerate a genuine link, or even invent one altogether. Everyone became aninstant expert on me and my experience.Sometimes this inventing isn’t really deliberate lying, in the usual sense. Ithink this phenomenon really bypasses conscious thought, coming from somewheremuch deeper, something primal. And although some such claims were damaging (anddifficult to counter when involving those close to me), I don’t see thisphenomenon as pathological. I think it’s natural and probably nearly universal,given a strong enough stimulus.For those less prone to this, all it takes to reach the threshold is for a TVcrew to extend a microphone and ask a question. This is true not just of ruralpeople—city people are just as prone. When heretofore bored people who havenever even personally seen a “celebrity” are suddenly treated like one, beinginterviewed by a news team from some exotic place, in an atmosphere asintoxicatingly sensationalistic as the one here in November 1975, some verysurprising remarks are certain to be made. Even the people making the remarkslater seemed surprised when the spell lifted. Later on there was a lot ofretraction, denial, backpedaling, apology, and just plain embarrassment.For as long as anyone can remember, this problem has plagued every policeinvestigation that has been the focus of much public attention. Exasperatedinvestigators have had to contend with a parade of well-meaning “witnesses,”each equally certain of his unique scenario but, often as not, each at odds withthe unpublished facts of the case. Harassed officials just put them in linebehind all the false confessors and copycat perpetrators. It wastes a lot oftime and manpower, but they have to check them all out. Veterans learn to expectit, but rookies, eager to solve the case quickly, often get taken in.Any skeptic who wants to stake his theory on quotes taken from this setting isbeing foolishly naive if he’s sincere, or dishonestly opportunistic if he’s not.(An aside: After noting how so many people lose themselves being near thespotlight, one might wonder if I was even more affected; but I’m proud to say Idon’t believe that I ever succumbed. I’m confident those who know me best willvouch for that.)The final area of discussion and a major factor instigating negative reactionwas “the debunkers’ obsession.” The carriers of that affliction, while notultimately effective, nevertheless have made quite an impact in the past onlarge groups who were affected by some of the other factors discussedhere—especially, and ironically, the “Ufologist Establishment,” whenjustification was needed for their sour-grapes reaction after APRO got the ball.In fact, the debunkers’ obsession is deeply intertwined with every other factorinvolved in backlash to the incident, either by being part of their cause,taking advantage of them in their tactics, or even partly resulting from them.Therefore, the debunkers’ obsession will serve as the framework and focus ofextensive discussion in later analysis of attacks on the validity of theincident.Conformity is one of humanity’s most powerful motivators. The dozen or socountertheories “explaining” my case were picked up and mindlessly repeated.Freewheeling, tradition-flaunting modem Americans are very fond of thinking ofthemselves as original, independent individuals. Not by a parsec, captain. Thetruth is, many people’s desire to submerge their egos into the safe bosom ofcollective identity is so dominating that it permeates every aspect of theirbehavior. Especially when they are confronted with something strange andfrightening that they perceive as a threat to their comfortable and accustomedworldview. Yet they believe they make up their own minds.Even when they rebel, most people do it in lockstep. The tradition-defyingsixties saw millions of “do your own thing” fashion clones, free spiritschanting in unison a chorus of identical iconoclastic slogans fitting theirgroup’s exclusive version of political correctness.Even when people actually do depart from what they perceive to be what “everyoneelse thinks,” they often pretend to share views held by the majority, even whenno particular stigma or moral high ground is associated with either view. Itseems that in the minds of far too many people, their desire to be right excusesitself when confronted with their terror of being different. So we have thesocial scientists scratching their heads over ostensible conformity and examplesof “faking good,” when polls and actual voting differ, surveys and actualbehavior are at odds.We all could take a frank look at our own supposedly unique “taste” in clothes,music, books, movies, even politics, then ask ourselves if it’s a coincidencethat millions of people share our taste and that in five years it will be alldifferent from this but it’ll still all be the same. Millions of people willhave made their “individual choices” from an identical new menu. We might askourselves, Who writes that menu?You may be thinking something like, Hey, if an entire herd of zebras all breakand run at once, they aren’t necessarily imitating each other, they might allhave seen the same lion. And this analogy would illustrate a perfectlyacceptable justification, if all these disbelieving people were subscribing to atheory that made any sense.However, you can be sure this analogy does not explain their reaction when thetheory to which they flock is so patched together that its form bears distinctartifacts of its originator’s unique needs. It’s obvious those seconding such anotion didn’t come up with something so peculiarly custom-tailored on their own.The best example of this is the theory stating that although my coworkers reallysaw me blasted through the air by a UFO, I instantly recovered physically,quickly gathered my wits, took this astounding event in stride, and then on thespur of the moment hatched a complex plan to take advantage of it.Yeah, right. With no warning I suddenly see the most shocking, awesome sight inmy entire life. Then I’m hit with a tremendous bolt of energy, which sends meflying through the air. When I finally come to, I’m afoot miles from nowhere.But instead of being overcome with fear that the craft would fire again or,assuming it had left, that it would return, and instead of wanting to headstraight to a hospital to see if I’m in serious need of immediate medicalattention, I calmly think far into the future. A little lightbulb in acartoonist’s balloon blinks on over my head, and with a devious cackle, I say tomyself, “Hey, this has the makings of a great book!” or, “I’ll teach those guysa lesson for running out on me when I needed them.” So instead of getting help,my first impulse is to (without a light, gun, or provisions) run off into thedark, somehow without leaving a single footprint (except those leading to thespot where I was hit), and hide in the forest with the idea of later claiming tohave been aboard.This absurd scenario doesn’t help the archskeptics much, since it acknowledgesthe reality of the UFO, but it came to be put forth because it met the specialneeds of a very few people involved in the investigation. The first person tosay it, probably Spaulding, had painted himself into a corner because of priorstatements recorded in the media. He had already stated unequivocally many timesthat he believed the six witnesses had actually seen a UFO, and gave detailedreports of ozone and magnetic readings to back it up. Then, when GSW lost thecase he made his angry vow to “blow this thing out today!”What could he do then? How could he avoid making himself look suspect or foolishin his reversal?This is what is known as ad hoc, meaning “for this case alone,” special, anafterthought.A second, absurdly incompatible idea was force-fit onto his original position.Ordinarily the evidence and reasoning that would justify belief in the initialpart of the incident would naturally carry through the entire thing, andconversely, a disbeliever would ordinarily dismiss the entire incident. Whichruns counter to Occam’s Razor—Non sunt multiplicanda entia praeter necessitatemor: “Entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity.”Occam’s Razor is a well-known (and often misunderstood) guideline in reasoningwhich says that the impulse to complicate theories needlessly and resort tounusual hypotheses in order to shore up an explanation ought not be indulged.Rather, it is observed that simpler, more common theories should first bepursued to a greater extent, as these are more frequently borne out as correct.It is not a “law,” but simply an observation about the odds of success invarious approaches to inquiry which boils down to say: The unusual is unlikelyand the common is, well, more common.“Skeptics” are fond of using this as if it meant that anything but a prosaicexplanation for rare events should be disregarded, which as applied to thisdiscussion amounts to saying UFO incidents don’t happen. Or, more perversely,they act as if it means the popular view is always right (which is exactly thefallacy of ad populem). Ironic, and perhaps a measure of their extremism, thatpro-rational principles actually could be distorted directly into logicalfallacies. As I’ll show, Occam’s Razor cuts the other way in regard to themismatched patchwork of desperately illogical alternative scenarios my criticsrummaged together.What really dismays me is that this odd “part true/part hoax” conglomeration wasadopted by a couple of people involved in the investigation who are otherwisepretty levelheaded. But come to think of it, they were in a circumstance similarto Spaulding’s, having made earlier endorsing statements and needing aconvenient position to which to withdraw (perhaps for some of the reasonsdescribed next). To be fair, and to try to exhaust all possible rationalexplanations, it is possible that this kind of reasoning, where an incident canbe half genuine, could come about like this:They start out with, “No way, they killed him”.Then the polygraph tests disprove that, yet still no Travis. So they accept thecrew’s being innocent of murder and grudgingly concede the possibility of theabduction. But the evidence is mounting and they begin to anticipate theconclusion to which it’s all leading—a conclusion with all the consequencesdescribed earlier. They panic; their minds begin resisting, grasping for a wayto avoid a conclusion they do not want.They can’t deny the evidence so far; the facts have already forced them toaccept it publicly, but to go further simply can’t be accommodated in theconceptual framework of their minds.For this group, this midstream bailout could be nothing more than apsychological defense mechanism. Even if they didn’t formulate this scenario,hearing someone like Spaulding say it provides them with just what they weresearching for.That covers the six main areas (plus conformity) I feel best explain why therewould be so much attack on the best-documented such incident ever. Enoughgeneralities about where these allegations came from. Before getting down to thenitty-gritty of specific charges, let’s take a quick review of the main pointsof the supporting evidence.Seven men witnessed the event. Every one of them has stood by his story for overtwo decades. All passed polygraph tests concerning what they saw. There weresimultaneous electrical outages in the nearest communities and various physicaltraces at the sight, all measured independently by persons hostile to thereport. The principle witness has undergone not only positive lie-detectortests, but also voice-stress analysis, regressive hypnosis, and a battery ofmedical and psychological tests. The polygraph examiners have stood by theirtruthful verdicts to this day. And skeptics have been scratching around for allthese years, keenly desirous of digging up anything that might remotely supporttheir case and essentially coming up with nothing but the garbage refuted here.Some people espoused multiple explanations simultaneously. But another reasonthere were so many alternative theories circulating was that as the current pettheory crumbled under the weight of undeniable evidence to the contrary, a newone was urgently needed to fill the breach.For example, the first major charge, that my coworkers murdered me, hid my body,and in desperation came up with a wild cover story, came to an abrupt andpermanent end when I was returned. This theory was seriously and widely helduntil the crew passed the state police lie-detector tests. Some people haddoubts even after the tests (but before my return).I shudder to think what might have become of my coworkers had I never beenreturned. (Of course, I shudder even more to think what would have become ofme!) I believe they would have lived under a shadow of suspicion for the rest oftheir lives—despite their polygraphs—to satisfy the prejudice of some.Dr. Harder has pointed out that six witnesses passing polygraph tests would havebeen more than sufficient evidence to have convicted a person of murder in anAmerican court of law. It is alarming—chilling—to think that the level ofevidence that can justify depriving a convicted man of his very life can be socasually dismissed just because it pointed to an undesired conclusion. And had Inot been returned, the rejection of my coworkers’ testimony would have beenaccompanied by their continuing to be suspected of that very charge—murder.An early theory of law enforcement’s, after the murder theory fell apart, wasthat since I had felt the beam as a “blow,” maybe the crew had hit me on thehead from behind, injected me with drugs, and put on masks or something, to insome way to make me perceive my “trip” as one on a spaceship. Medical examsshowed no evidence of a blow to the head or drugs in my blood or urine. Likemost of these imaginative scenarios, this just doesn’t square with any of theeasily verified facts of the situation.One line of reasoning proposed that we didn’t know what we saw, that we hadmisidentified the planet Jupiter, a plasma, ball lightning, papier-mâché, aweather balloon, a rubber raft, a hubcap someone had hung in a tree, or a sunlitcloud. The sheer variety of alternatives again points out that it wasn’t forceof evidence for any one idea motivating this thinking, but some belief prior tothe casting about for explanations.Plasmas and ball lightning are phenomena as rare and esoteric (if not more so)as UFOs. So much for Occam’s Razor. The weather had been clear and dry. Wehadn’t seen the object indistinctly, from a distance. It wasn’t papier-mâchéhanging from a tree; it wasn’t a point of light in the sky. We saw (and heard) adistinct, glowing, mechanical object hovering in midair at such close range thatit was clear and unmistakable. No sincerely open-minded person could suggestsuch alternatives to explain our perception.During the making of the film Fire in The Sky, Mike Rogers and I visited theIndustrial Light and Magic complex and saw the special effects developed for themovie. It took dozens of highly specialized people months and millions ofdollars to equal what we saw; and then only through the restricted and enhancedviewpoint of the camera.One local elderly couple claimed to have seen me hitchhiking along the highwaywhile the search was under way. They say that when I recognized them, I ran offinto the woods and hid. They claimed to have seen me in an area that wasliterally crawling with people searching specifically for me, and where justabout everyone would have an eye out. The sheriff had issued an all-pointsbulletin on me. And I’m supposedly standing out on a highway thumbing rides andthis couple are the only ones to see me?Town Marshal Sanford Flake, skeptical of the UFO report from the start, wentover and interviewed the couple. They began arguing between themselves aboutwhether it really had been me. Then they decided it had been me in disguise, butthey still differed on major details. UFO doubter though he was, Marshal Flakehad no recourse but to dismiss the matter.Another example of human susceptibility is the “Kook Demands Airtime” story.Before my abduction, it was said, I had called a famous radio talkshow host anddemanded to be put on the air to talk about UFOs. Rebuffed as a “kook,” Iallegedly called back after my return and said: “Now who’s a kook?”For a long time I believed that this story had been invented by the skepticaldeputy, Coplan. It was he who first publicly suggested this scenario, but laterdenied doing so. Later, when another deputy was quoted, characterizing the storyas “a bunch of bullshit, a rumor, it never happened,” I figured that was the endof the matter. The Sheriff's Department must have looked into it and concludedthere was nothing to it. They may have done the obvious—examined the studiotapes of the program. Supporting this impression was the fact that my foremostdetractors dropped the issue like a hot rock—though their motive for keeping tothemselves the reason for their retreat from the tale demonstrates the ethicalshortcomings in the conduct of their entire campaign.(However, in fairness to the deputy, I wondered if, by coincidence, beforeNovember 5 some crank did call a radio show about UFOs and get rebuffed. Then myincident hit the news, creating an opportunity for this person to call back andimpersonate me in order to try to avenge his earlier treatment. Or perhaps thecaller had only mentioned my recent incident as an example to show the ideashe’d expressed earlier weren’t so far out after all. Then, like a child’s gameof gossip, it just grew with each person’s hearing and retelling.)I recently learned that this story originated when someone contacted the sheriffand claimed to have heard the second call at 2:45 A.M. on November 13. She neverclaimed to have heard the first call, in which the caller apparently never gavehis name. So, unless there was error or deceit involved in her report itself,this fits my earlier speculation that impersonation was involved. At the precisedate and time of the reported call I was sequestered at the Scottsdale SheratonInn, in terrible emotional condition and constantly surrounded by APRO personneland a team of reporters. Any long-distance call from me would have had to passthrough the hotel switchboard and would have appeared on the hotel bill. Icertainly never made such a call, then or at any other time or place.The Psychological Stress Evaluation (PSE) may be a dubious process, butvoice-print analysis and identification is a very real and highly developedscience. I later found out the sheriff did undertake to obtain the tapes of theshow for an ID of the caller. I was unable to confirm or obtain documentation ofwhat transpired then, but whatever it was led them to conclude it was “arumor—it never happened.”Deputy Ken Coplan was also quoted in a variety of ways, some self-contradictory,concerning my mother’s reaction when he and Mike went to give her the news.Apparently her failure to cry or lose control was not at all what Coplanexpected. From the descriptions, it should be obvious that her reaction was justthe sort you would expect from a strong woman independent enough to spend hersummers alone in a remote mountain cabin. I’m not sure which, if any, areaccurate as far as what Coplan really said, but he was quoted variously assaying my mother’s first words were: “My son is with God on a UFO”; “Well,that’s just the way these things happen”; “Well, I’m not the least bitsurprised”; and a couple of other, equally unreal and ridiculous statements.Since Mike had been present and knew these were not her words, he recentlycalled Coplan to determine exactly what he more recently [1993] recalls abouther reaction. Mike asked him if, in all his experience as an officer deliveringbad news to relatives, families always reacted emotionally. Coplan answered thatmost of them did—which suggests that some didn’t; but it also implies that hestands by his feeling she should have broken down and cried. However, when Mikesaid, “. . . I was just wondering how you felt. In my opinion she acted sort ofnumb, before she began to act like everything was basically—” Coplan theninterjected: “Well, sure, you know she was, she was acting like a mother thatwas upset, you know, but that’s normal.” Finally! He’d acknowledged that,although she wasn’t as emotional as he had expected, she did not appearunconcerned, and that he could see she really was upset.Deputy Coplan was challenged by APRO (he recalls it was by the Enquirer) to takea polygraph test concerning this matter and a number of other assertionsreported by the news media that he allegedly made about the case. He refused,however, saying he preferred to forget the whole thing.Dr. William S. Bickel, physics professor at the University of Arizona, made somepoorly informed criticisms of the state police polygraph examinations on my sixcoworkers, which were subsequently widely repeated. He claimed that the testsconsisted of three questions: (l) Was any witness involved in foul play or angryat me? (2) Did any witness know if anyone else was involved in foul play? and(3) What did each witness see?Bickel falsely claimed that the witnesses could pass the first two, fail thethird, and still get a passing grade on the tests. All questions must be passedto pass: Allen Dalis earned an official “inconclusive” for walking out beforehis test was over. Moreover, Bickel’s third question could never be on anypolygraph test, since it can’t be answered yes or no.The fact is the official report listed four questions or question areas; threedid seem to focus on the murder theory, and the fourth was worded on the report:“Did you tell the truth about actually seeing a UFO last Wednesday when TravisWalton disappeared?” So it might appear that the primary focus was on foul play.However, there were variations in the wording of the questions among the sixwitnesses. (There were not variations within the three or four runs through thecharts on one individual. For purposes of comparison, wording must remainidentical for each person’s entire charts.)The men later reported being asked variations of the wording in the fourquestion areas each as asked. (I wasn’t there; I’m going by what I’ve been told.There’s a small possibility they confused test questions with pretest interviewquestions.) One reported variation of the UFO question was: “Do you believe thatTravis Walton was actually taken aboard a UFO last Wednesday?” Also, one of the“foul play” questions—“Do you know if Travis Walton’s body is buried or hiddensomewhere in the Turkey Springs area?”—doubles as a question relative to the UFOhoax issue, especially in its variation; “Do you know if Travis Walton is hiddensomewhere in the Turkey Springs area?”One thing to be emphasized is that, in keeping with standard proper procedure,each man was interviewed by the examiner prior to being hooked to the machine,to make sure each man clearly understood his answers represented points drawnfrom what he had told the examiner and other authorities in the investigation.The examiner made sure the questions’ meanings were unambiguous and in directcontext to the pretest interview. Skilled examiners leave no room for mistakeninterpretation or rationalization. (This in response to the uninformedspeculation that the men could have seen only the planet Jupiter, thenconsciously tricked the examiner by thinking of that while saying yes to havingseen a UFO.)Finally, the state police polygraph expert, Cy Gilson, obviously thought thequestioning adequate in regard to the UFO, because he gave his opinion of itstruth in his report to Sheriff Gillespie. He wrote, “These polygraphexaminations prove that these five men did see some object they believe to be aUFO and that Travis Walton was not injured or murdered by any of these men onthat Wednesday (5 November 1975).” He even elaborated on the UFO issue to refutelaw enforcement’s hoax theory with the conclusion that, “If an actual UFO didnot exist and the UFO (incident) is a man-made hoax, five of these men had noprior knowledge of a hoax.” Notice Gilson mentioned the UFO before any referenceto foul play. Also note the word “prove” was used, an unusually strong term forpolygraph examiners. They usually use words like indicate or show, or write thatthe subject “believes” such and such. He used such a definite term becauseconsistent responses from such a large number of individuals on a single issueraises the statistical reliability to virtual certainty.The test on one of the six witnesses, that of Allen Dalis, was officially ruledinconclusive. Possible explanations offered by experts included: (a) that Allenperhaps felt some guilt response to a question about hostility toward me becausehe may have had such feelings; (b) conceivably, at least in part, he had someguilt over recent unrelated misdeeds; or (c) that this was simply because ofAllen’s extreme emotional volatility. The latter may have been exacerbated byhis agitation after witnessing the incident. In any case, “inconclusive” meansjust that—no determination is possible either way.I recently managed to get ahold of a copy of the original police report on theincident, which contained an interesting passage. On page three of Case-Number23-75-56, Deputy Ellison wrote: “On Monday, November 10, the six men who werewith Walton at the time of his disappearance, were subjected to polygraph testsat their own request, and of the six all of them passed the test with a positivereading. The fifth man was inconclusive on one phase of the test but it wasstated that he ‘had basically told the truth.’ ” This quote also appeared in onenews article back then, but wasn’t given the attention it deserved.Allen now admits to me that lingering bad feelings toward me caused him to knowhe was not going to come out clean on that phase of the test. He knew he wasinnocent of harming me, but felt his past misunderstandings with me mightfalsely brand him a murderer. This led to the blowup that ended with him walkingout of the room before he had fully completed his test—a test on which hisanswer to the UFO question checked out. After the murder theory was conclusivelydisproved, it would have been nice if Allen’s passing of the UFO question couldhave been made official. But polygraph procedure is strict: If he couldn’t sitthrough all of his last run, the examiner was bound to officially rule itinconclusive. But again, “inconclusive” is a neutral verdict.A long-standing assumption of UFO skeptics is that having prior knowledge orinterest in the subject, and especially having a previous sighting, impeaches aperson as a reliable witness. However, respected national polling organizationsrepeatedly find that over half the people in this country believe in thepossibility of UFOs, and fourteen percent have seen them. Prior consideration ofthe question is nearly universal. Reputable people from every walk of lifereport distinct sightings, including astronauts and former U.S. presidents fromboth parties (and several of our local law officers, including the sheriff.) Yetskeptics seem to be saying that a report coming from a substantial percentage ofthe population should automatically be discounted!Debunkers say the typical person who believes UFOs are real is a kook, a littleold lady in tennis shoes, or some poorly educated farmer. On the contrary, thetruth is that polls show that the older a person is, the less likely he is toaccept the idea. Polls also show that the more educated a person is, the morelikely they are to believe UFOs exist. Further, in 1979, when IndustrialResearch and Development magazine did a survey of its readership (predominantlyhigh-tech, Ph.D. types at the very least), belief in the reality of UFOs went upto sixty one percent of respondents. Even higher percentages were obtained in asurvey of the high-IQ association, Mensa, where the incidence of belief is sixtyfour percent—much higher than the general population. But in the archskeptics’typical reasoning pattern, this doesn’t add credibility to the subject, itsimply discredits the intelligentsia.Odds are overwhelming that you have talked about UFOs at the dinner table, orcommented in response to a show or news report on UFOs. How would you feel to betold that simply reading this book impeaches you, henceforth and forever, as areliable witness if you were to sight such a craft? What the debunkers have withthis criterion essentially is a “one size fits all” excuse to dismiss nearlyevery UFO case! So of course this criterion was heavily applied to mine. It wasfalsely claimed that the entire Walton family had been fanatical UFO buffs foryears.I do not assert that my family had never heard of the subject or spoken of itbefore. The mild degree of interest some family members exhibited is perfectlyunderstandable in light of my brother’s sighting twelve years prior to myincident. Duane has something in common with fourteen percent of the population.If the chances are one in seven of an individual having a sighting, it meansthat if an event as extraordinary as mine happened to anyone else at random,odds are overwhelming they would at least have a close associate or relative whohad experienced a prior sighting. Most people have more than seven close friendsor relatives. Whether considering a family of seven like mine, or our crew ofseven, simple arithmetic proves that what some treated as a suspiciouslyunlikely coincidence was in fact a nearly inevitable likelihood!I can see that true “repeaters,” individuals who report sightings constantly orroutinely, would violate statistical norms (even if constant sky-watching couldmeasurably increase odds). But such frequency would be negatively significantonly if it could first be established that sightings are indeed random and notconcentrated in particular areas or on particular individuals due to someinitiative on the part of the craft occupants. The combination of wide-openskies and seclusion of rural areas might contribute to greater frequency ofsightings there, but I know of no studies demonstrating this. The more extremeof the “buff” claims asserted that not only did I come from a “UFO family,” Icame from a “UFO culture,” an environment where almost everyone sees them allthe time. In light of the community reaction to the incident, this charge islaughable. If someone had made a survey here before 1975, they would havediscovered that this area was no more believing than the rest of the country,and probably considerably less so.To illustrate that point: In late March of 1993, just after the release of thefilm Fire in the Sky, a huge glowing object passed over the Mogollon Rim areajust after sunset. It was so large it was clearly visible by witnesses overeighty miles apart. It was so huge that from my perspective it subtended anangular span about a fourth that of a full moon, even though simultaneousobservers eighteen miles away were telling me on the phone it was almostdirectly overhead. A local scanner buff told me he overheard police, some fromway over in Apache County, asking each other, “Do you see what I think I see?”Its shape was that of a sphere so flattened it appeared disclike; four thick,equally spaced, leglike appendages hung from the rim. I admit that when I firstsaw it I was pretty excited, perhaps even a little alarmed, and made a madscramble for the video camera.However, through powerful binoculars I was readily able to see detail sufficientto identify it correctly: a weather balloon. I could even make out a long cablehanging from the center with a shiny unit at its end. Apparently it was so highthat it was bathed in sunlight from below the horizon, giving it an etherealglow.The police soon came to the same conclusion. At the local airport a report wasrelayed from a pilot who had just landed that he had seen a balloon he estimated(probably inaccurately) as nearly a quarter of a mile across. A second, similarballoon drifted across the sky at about the same time of evening on September10, 1993, barely generating comment. They were spectacular sights, yet there wasno rash of UFO reports in the local news. In fact, as far as I know, neither ofthese huge objects were even mentioned in the Arizona media. In spite of therecent release of the movie, people in the area exhibited no specialpredisposition to misidentify the object, but responded quite rationally.The key problem with the “buff’ question is the definition of the term. If mybeing a “buff’ means ever having discussed the subject or seen something in thesky I couldn’t identify, then the answer is yes, and I join a majority of peoplein the civilized world in being so labeled. However, if it means buying booksand magazines on the subject, spending a lot of one’s spare time thinking aboutit, going to UFO conferences, joining organizations, being knowledgeable aboutthe subject, then I can say that I’m not even close to being a buff.Before November 5, 1975, I had never seen anything I knew definitely to be aUFO. Other than my brother, no one else in the family has seen one. I havetalked with him on a couple of occasions about the subject since then, but we’venever had a disproportionate interest in the topic. None of us has eversubscribed to any UFO publications or joined any UFO groups. In fact, we hadnever heard of APRO, GSW, CUFOS, NICAP, MUFON, or any other research group (inspite of the fact that two of them were head-quartered in Arizona) before allhell broke loose in November 1975.Past activity on my part in the UFO community would have come to light when theUFO buff charge was very publicly debated. It’s the sort of thing that is easilychecked. “Debunkers” could have asked people who know me, checked membershipfiles, publisher’s sales records, subscription lists. I’ll bet they did checkand, when they came up empty, deliberately kept quiet about their discoveries.(More later on why I think this is true.)I have a very wide set of interests and many are keen interests, but UFOs aren’tone of the keen ones, even now! In the years since this happened I’ve got toknow a number of individuals who would easily acknowledge fitting the second“buff’ description given above. Ask any of them if they think it fits me, too.To this day my activity and knowledge in this area is minimal. And the skepticsknow this.If I had had prior UFO interest, I could have used the incident as a perfectexcuse to display a newfound obsession with the subject. I (and my “avid buff’family as well) could have got out there and basked in the “UFO celebrity”limelight that the debunkers claim is a prime mover in such reports. We didn’t.However, I don’t believe such activity would discredit my case; I simply neverhad such an obsession in the first place.The second definition of “UFO buff’ given above is the one I think isreasonable, and it’s the one I had in mind when I passed a polygraph answeringno to the question “Were you a UFO buff?” The broad variety of my interests, mybrother’s sighting, and the subject’s ubiquity in the media made it completelynatural for the topic occasionally to come up in our many wide-ranging,on-the-job discussions—especially since current news reports were what broughtit up. It would have been strange if we hadn’t ever spoken of UFOs. Still, suchtalk was extremely rare overall, the tiniest fraction of our discussions.Actually, the “buff’ claim was magnified almost solely from some statementsattributed to my mother and brother during a few of the most turbulent daysfollowing the incident. Remember, my family includes five other members. None ofthe others ever had any statements on this topic ascribed to them, except(negatively) Don, whose skepticism led him to tear into slash-piles looking formy corpse. While I was missing Duane tore the lock off the door to a room in mymother’s house where I kept personal belongings, so evidently he was initiallymore skeptical then he had let on.My mother’s expression of belief that I was not on this earth, that I had beentaken by a UFO, was not improper under those circumstances. This was after athorough but unsuccessful search; after hearing sincere accounts from thecrewmen, some of whom she knew very well. She placed great faith in Duane, andaccepted his reassurances. However, beyond those factors, any concerned motherwould prefer to believe her son was taken, with a chance of return, than tobelieve him murdered and buried somewhere. She was terribly upset and had to besedated. With no corpse to finalize matters, it was only natural to hope againsthope that I might be safe with non-hostile intelligences.Duane’s harsh criticism of one investigator for expressing doubt concerningchances of my return after so much time, his expression of confidence in myreturn, his saying that I was having “the experience of a lifetime,” andrepeating “they don’t kill people” were remarks directed partially at bolsteringmy mother’s morale. And, whether Duane wants to admit it or not, they were alsoaimed at convincing himself. But by no means does uttering such reassurancesrequire any deep interest in or knowledge of the subject of UFOs.My mother supposedly saying she had seen UFOs in the past was in contrast withher passing a polygraph test answering no to ever having seen “a flying saucer.”If she did make the earlier-mentioned statements as immoderately as was claimed,she (if not the person retelling it) may have fallen prey to humansusceptibility. Or perhaps both attributions are true. It’s common for people tosee unusual movement in distant points of light at night and think of these asUFOs, since, although potentially preternatural, they are unidentified. But theterm “flying saucer” brings to mind a definite image of a disc-shapedspacecraft, which hardly could be considered unidentified, and implies muchcloser observation. My mother’s polygraph test, in addition to addressingallegations of a hoax, included questions about being deeply involved with UFOphenomena. The examiner concluded that “Mrs. Mary Kellett has answered all thequestions truthfully according to the best of her knowledge and beliefs.”At first I didn’t believe Duane had made some of the remarks attributed to him;they didn’t sound like Duane. I was surprised when I read tape transcripts of atape made at the site during the search. When Duane volunteered thesestatements, the interviewer reportedly was irritated that Duane was interruptingan interview with someone else, describing Duane as “pushy,” “hyped-up.” You maybe thinking that all this amounts to is Duane’s having fallen prey to the humansusceptibility discussed earlier. I can’t deny this would account for some ofDuane’s behavior, because I don’t believe anyone there was completely free fromit. Frankly, there were major exaggerations in a few of his remarks. However,there was also—and more importantly—a core of truth in what he said. Duane hadalready grilled the crew; by then he didn’t merely believe it had happened, hefelt he knew it had happened. He had had his own sighting. But, I dimlyremembered having a conversation with Duane, years before the Turkey Springsincident, about his sighting, in which I’d jokingly remarked out of bravado, “Ifthey grab you, have ’em come back and get me, too.” This offhand comment wasblown completely out of proportion years later.Like people in any area, those living out here in the Arizona mountains havetheir own unique characteristics. What some people viewed as Duane’s lack ofconcern for me was something that was really jumped on. This is an example ofjudging by a standard of “normal reaction” that has no justification in reality.It doesn’t take into account either the special circumstances or the uniquenessof the individuals involved.And Duane Walton is an extraordinary individual. People sometimes commented onsimilarities between him and me, but we are very different in most respects.I’ve been called “wild” and “intense” in the past, but if you wanted to see“intense” in those days you would have had to meet Duane.Duane always had a very striking effect on people. He had a strong “presence”about him. Some called him overbearing or pushy; he was the type of person whocrackled with energy to the point that he seemed about to explode (notnecessarily in the sense of anger). He maintained his massive body-weight onsurprisingly little food. He kept up a work and training schedule that wouldhave killed most men. In the midst of stimulating events, lack of sleep didn’tslow him down a bit. Mike recalls that Duane nearly walked Mike’s legs offduring the search. Duane was attacked for saying he believed I was having “theadventure of a lifetime”; in a way, he was the one having the adventure of alifetime, and he was irrepressible.Investigators could have easily discovered, by asking anyone who knew him, Duanelived unswervingly by his own uncompromising code: No punches pulled. What yousee is what you get. Take it or leave it. Let the chips fall where they may. Hesays what’s on his mind, and was even more forthright back in 1975. But noteveryone appreciates his bluntness as candor. I now believe some of the impetusfor negative comments on Duane from Spaulding and a certain few lawmen arosefrom their having felt diminished by him.Duane is an army vet, a skydiver. What attitude would you expect from a man whojumps out of airplanes, who straps himself to the back of fifteen hundred poundsof raging bull for the fun of it? Yet some thought it odd he wasn’t wringing hishands and wailing about his missing brother. Duane was not one to display fearor weakness to anyone. I once saw a screaming, furious man point a loaded 44Magnum at him and cock it. Duane didn’t even flinch; he merely challenged theman to drop his gun and come get him, one on one.I used to warn him about the risks of his lifestyle. He would say: “I’d ratherlive a day as a lion than a lifetime as a lamb.” Duane has accumulated a fewinjuries now, and he’s mellowed some, but he still skydives, and breaks andtrains horses for a living. But he was a hell of an adventurer himself in thosedays; so why wouldn’t he say he envied me “having the adventure of a lifetime”?How would you expect a man like him to react?A number of things Duane said, which were taken as evidence of a previouspreoccupation with the subject, were actually things he had only recently heardfrom ufologists and UFO buffs who sought him out at the site. They were quiteeager to share their knowledge, giving everyone there, including Duane, a crashcourse in the subject. It would be only natural for him to have done somethinking on the subject after his sighting. But anyone who knew Duane then wouldvouch that he rarely, if ever, spoke on the subject prior to what happened tome.What’s really nonsensical here is that Duane’s remarks were supposed to be someindication that he was party to a scheme acted out for public consumption. He’san intelligent man. If there was any truth to such suspicions, it would be hardto explain why he didn’t tailor his remarks to simulate a more expected,acceptable reaction to my “disappearance.”I guess many people’s concept of life is so mundane it can barely accommodatethe fact that sometimes unusual things do happen. And they barely have room forthe idea that the world outside their televisions might contain someextraordinary people. But when extraordinary things happen to extraordinarypeople, those people’s minds go into overload.The bottom line here: Duane passed two thorough series of polygraph testquestions proving he had no knowledge of any hoax and had never been a UFO buff,and had not even read a book on the subject.Later I offer additional disproof (as if it were needed) of the irrelevant“buff’ innuendo, with the polygraph tests I passed. And it actually isirrelevant, simply because it ignores so many other forms of specific evidencewhich speak directly to the central issue—what we saw and what happened.After my first meeting with Sheriff Gillespie I saw him quoted in the newsmedia, concerning what I had told him of my experience. The report differed in afew details from what I had told Gillespie, but at the time I didn’t think muchof it because almost every news report concerning the episode contained errors.I figured that when subsequent accurate accounts were published, Gillespie, whowas as familiar as anyone with media inaccuracy, would realize the discrepancyhad been an error—either the reporter’s or his own.I found out later Gillespie takes pride in his reputation for recalling details.He chose to insist his retelling was accurate. I insist he is quite mistaken.When Gillespie arrived at Duane’s home in Phoenix, I was still in terrible shapefrom my ordeal, and Duane was fiercely protective. He asked Gillespie not tophotograph or record his interview with me. Gillespie took no notes, although heclaimed to have written it down afterward.Gillespie heard a very condensed version of what happened to me at a time when Icould barely bring myself to talk about it; with Duane standing over him,clearly displeased that the sheriff was making me relive the ordeal. SheriffGillespie had heard a lot of people talking about various other UFO cases forseven days—seven days during which he had been under tremendous pressure withvery little sleep. Under such conditions, even persons with the best recallwould naturally make more errors.Understand that this isn’t a case of me having said I saw a ten-foot Jellyfishfrom Venus one day, then switching back to the real story the next. The problemis simply that Gillespie confused the two types of aliens and some other minordetails. So in his version, among other minor discrepancies, he had medescribing awakening to find tall, blue suited humanoids with helmets standingover me. It’s one thing to misremember things related verbally, quite another tomisremember events one personally experiences. I was in bad shape, but could nothave confused events in that way.However, I’ve been interviewed many times by reporters (another professionrelying on accurate recall) who did take notes, and most of them made similarmistakes or worse—only I’d become wise enough to tape the interviews so I couldprove they had erred. Duane agrees that Gillespie was mistaken. The sheriff’sversion was the only one that didn’t agree with those heard by everyone elsearound me during those days and since that time he has not, to my knowledge,mentioned it again.But Gillespie was an elected official, on the spot with that one. Gillespie’sreport was in the papers—what would people think if he acknowledged his error?I’m not saying he’s consciously insincere, only that the embarrassment of theadmission might have him prefer to stick by his account.No one’s memory is perfect. However, I do realize that the sheriff found himselfin an awkward position several times throughout the whole affair. Comparing hisactions to those of many other people involved, I have to say his performancewas amazingly professional. I don’t believe anyone else involved could havehandled the situation as competently.One development that brought a lot of negative press was my failure to appearfor the polygraph test Sheriff Gillespie had set up for me. I had been returnedon the morning of November 11. Gillespie saw me on the 13th and set up the testfor the following morning. I had gotten almost no sleep and was still interrible shape when Gillespie interviewed me, but, being ignorant of polygraphtesting, agreed to take one as soon as possible. I subsequently learned the hardway that taking a test so soon, when I was still in such emotional upheaval,virtually guaranteed stressful tracings.The big question in skeptical minds was, Why didn’t I show? The question thatdidn’t seem to occur to anyone was: If I had something to hide, why did Irequest the test in the first place? I was not under arrest or charged with anycrime. This was all strictly voluntary. I was simply eager to prove myself.I was in no condition to get mobbed by reporters and had requested there be nopublicity about the test. Gillespie had promised that there would be none. Whenwe were preparing to leave for the test, a reporter telephoned and wanted toknow details about the upcoming “secret” test. Then, on television, we saw manyreporters at the testing location. The polygraph examiner was shown next to hismachine, evidently inside the testing room.Yet Gillespie insisted he had kept our agreement. He (at the appointed time, twohundred miles away in his office in Holbrook) strenuously denied the media hadbeen there. “There was not one TV camera, there was not one newspaper man, notone, at the place where I told you to go.” He even denied that he had personallyannounced the upcoming test. But a November 14, 1975, Associated Press newspaperstory stated: “The sheriff said Walton will take a polygraph test today as astep toward proving or disproving his story.” Hal Starr, APRO’s director ofpublic relations, spoke with one of those reporters who had been there andconfirmed that many reporters had awaited my arrival. Even Cy Gilson admitsknowing of cameras set up in office windows across the street. (On March 12,1993, Phoenix local TV station KPHO Channel 5’s Larry Martel spoke scathingly ofthat day: “You recall at several staged events at where he was to appear, he didnot appear.” Cohost: “That’s right, one of them being the time he was supposedto take a lie detector applied by a DPS polygrapher and never showed up.” LarryMartel: “And reporters swarmed around there and waited and waited and waited,but no Travis.”)Gillespie later tried to use the excuse that even if there had been mediapresent, they would not have been allowed inside the testing building while thetests were actually being conducted, and that we could have gotten into thebuilding through a side or rear entrance. Since Gillespie wasn’t there maybe hereally believed there were no media present. Maybe those news quotes of thesheriff's announcement were misattributions of statements by someone else in hisoffice or at DPS. Perhaps it could be claimed his was a legitimatemisunderstanding of what “no media” means. But it certainly didn’t square withwhat I understood as our agreement. What little trust we had had was gone.One of the long-established beliefs concerning UFOs in the minds of the Americanpublic is that the government tries to suppress public knowledge and acceptanceof this phenomenon. The thought had occurred to Duane immediately after myreturn that if he were to put me in the hands of authorities, it could be thelast he’d ever see of me alive. The previous uproar over this issue at thecrew’s polygraph test and APRO’s comments did nothing to lessen our distrust ofa government-sponsored test. In fact, as stated in APRO’s November 14, 1975,press release, APRO specifically recommended against a polygraph as too soonafter the trauma and because of fear of a possible government coverup. Inlooking back, I wonder if perhaps maintaining exclusivity of the investigationand of all test results may have also been a factor in the minds of thoseadvising me.Gillespie set up a second test I never even learned of until I read it reportedin the newspaper. The Sheriff’s Department had already issued a November 14,1975, press release saying \". . as of now, this office and the Department ofPublic Safety will not be conducting any further examinations in this matter. .. any further testing of Walton will now be up to Walton and a privateexaminer.” I had no advance knowledge of any second test, and probably wouldn’thave agreed to it anyway, because it had been publicized, and because my faithhad already been breached. And I was beginning to feel more apprehensive aboutthe government-conspiracy angle myself. Nevertheless, here again was anotherunfair situation I held absolutely no responsibility for, resulting in anotherround of negative reports.What I was focused on at that time was the medical testing. Was I okay? Was Igoing to suffer horribly, perhaps die, from the effects of breathing some toxicatmosphere, or radiation sickness, or some bizarre infection unknown to medicalscience? Had the blue beam of energy done any permanent damage? These questionsobviously have long since been resolved, but at that time I was terrified.Even that terror was nothing compared to the shock I was desperately strugglingwith. I was barely coping with the psychological impact of what I had beenthrough. I was hanging by a thread, desperately clinging to my senses, on theverge of disintegrating.I think it’s pretty unrealistic for anyone to visualize themselves in mysituation, in that condition, and imagine that my number-one top priority wouldbe a polygraph test. I knew what had really happened, and I was confident ofproving it in good time. A test sponsored by APRO would help ensure (I naivelybelieved) a fair outcome.Earlier in this story I described the day of the sighting as a typical workday;which it was, except for my being asleep when the truck got to the job site.Most of the guys had done this at least once. Allen had had a sick hangoverthree or four days before and had stayed in the truck all morning.At that time I was not about to tell Mike I’d been out late with his sister thenight before, not after taking a day of sick leave. In The Walton Experience Iwas trying to show readers what a typical workday was like; being tired in themorning wasn’t typical. I omitted that embarrassing detail, not thinking it hadany significance to the sighting and subsequent events; but, since a questionhas been raised, here’s the straight of it.An attempt was made to buy Steve Pierce’s testimony to deny the reality of thesighting, which never came about, as he had nothing to sell (and the subornerprobably had no intention of actually paying). However, he did claim in hisconversations with the person relaying the offer that I had not worked at allthat day, was gone most of the day, and that Mike Rogers had disappeared forhours that morning.I don’t know if Steve sticks by this claim since I haven’t spoken to or seen himin years. None of the other six of us supports Steve’s claim. You might bethinking that I shouldn’t bother to go into this since Steve said it only afteran attempt at paid testimony, but I’ve set out to cover them all.When we do fuel break, as opposed to when we do regular thinning, we have tostay in a tight group because the pilers have to stack the slash. If the sawyersdon’t complete the cutting in any given spot before moving on, our pile spacingwould be off; the trees cut later would knock piles over and there wouldinevitably be material overlooked that needed to be cut. As is usual, the roadparalleled the piling strip. Since I’m too tall to lie in the truck seatcomfortably with the door shut, the door was open, facing the guys who werealways making trips back to the truck for water, gas, saw tools, or parts.I spent less than two hours resting. Otherwise I put in as long and hard a dayas the others. Mike retorted: “I was not gone from the job that day, or anyother day, not for two hours or any other amount of time. Travis had been sickthe day before, and he spent some time that morning lying in the truck. But hespent the rest of the day working with the crew.”Here’s what John Goulette had to say about it:“The truck is never very far away, usually not even out of sight. They move itup, keep it close to the crew. We keep all our lunches and stuff in it. That dayI think we took two breaks—one halfway through the morning, and one halfwaythrough the afternoon.“Nobody left the work site. We were cutting pretty well all along the line. Thepilers come up right behind us. They pile right behind us. You know, if you’reout working, working pretty hard, and you see somebody else goofing off, youkind of notice if they’re not there. You think they’re out messing around.Nobody’s going to put up with that, if you’re sweating away and somebody else isgoofing off.“Nobody was gone that day. It’s not true that Travis and Mike took off, orsomething, and then came back a couple of hours later together.”More later about the attempt to pay Steve for false testimony.All a publicity stunt, a way to get attention? Nonsense. Had I been seekingpublicity, I would have jumped in, center stage, when all the reporters wereclamoring for an interview, and grabbed every inch of print and minute ofairtime possible. I would not have remained sequestered in the face of suchactive interest expressed by the media. My silence shifted more attention to mydetractors and generated much negative reporting. (Another bit of media wisdom:Refusal to comment nearly always brings about a negative slant.)My cooperation with APRO’s Enquirer-financed testing has been denounced as acontradiction to my other efforts to avoid the media. But a single interview,monitored by APRO officials in a subdued and controlled setting, was completelyin keeping with my stated objective to avoid being mobbed and forced to field abarrage of insensitive questions. I never received the money offered by theEnquirer for my exclusive story. We were taken completely by surprise when thepublication’s annual prize for the best UFO story of the year was awarded to us.I turned down many offers from writers and movie producers. I avoided moreinterviews than I gave, and in every case it was they who sought me out. I nevereven reported the incident in the first place. That was out of my hands. To thisday, I have never sought an interview. Media presence kept me from thatpolygraph-test appointment. No, if I were a headline grabber I certainly wouldnot have remained silent so long. All I wanted after my return was to be leftalone to think things over and adjust. I maintained that stance for years.I found myself in a “damned if I do, damned if I don’t” dilemma. If I gaveinterviews, it proved me a publicity seeker. If I rejected a public forum, I wasunwilling to face my detractors. One so-called debunker even excused his actionsin publishing a false charge he was later forced to retract by saying that hehad published it long ago and I hadn’t immediately rebutted it. In other words,if I ignore my critics, they interpret it as conceding the truth of theircharges. They’re going to wish I had remained retired.My attackers dug up a number of “witnesses” to attempt to discredit me. Here area couple more classic examples of the human susceptibility problem. These“charges” easily could have been exposed with the simplest attempt to check themout, but those doing the reporting were not so disposed.A man who owns one of the local motels was quoted at the time of the incident assaying: “Bullshit! Long before this happened I thought he and Duane were bigbullshitters. They exaggerated everything. I don’t trust them as far as I canthrow them. . . Bullshit! I don’t believe it.”This guy has never spoken with Duane Walton in his life. I’ll bet he never knewI had a third brother before November 1975; I wouldn’t be surprised to learn henever knew I existed before then. Duane did not live in Snowflake, and when hecame up to visit on rare occasions he always stayed at Mom’s. I hadn’t seenDuane in weeks when the UFO incident happened. I did not know who this guy wasat that time, and although I know who he is now—I see him downtownoccasionally—I have never confronted him. He and I both already know the truthconcerning his remarks. But how in the world could I have ever “bullshitted” or“exaggerated” anything to this guy when to this day I have never spoken withhim? Unless the guilty party is whoever first quoted—or misquoted—him, I say heis the big bullshitter. Over the years countless investigators, journalists, andfilm crews have come to see me in Snowflake, and I’ve always known where not tosend them for accommodations.Another man heard William Spaulding attacking me on the radio and came forwardto tell Spaulding’s field man he had known me since 1969 (human susceptibilityagain), and that Allen Dalis and I had always been together, heavily into drugs,burglary, car theft, and other unsavory activities. I supposedly lived in westPhoenix, attended—with Allen and the “witness”—Carl Hayden High School there,earned below-average grades, etc. Spaulding’s field man told this man he’d sureappreciate him calling with more of “whatever we can find in addition to this,to rate it kind of down, why this we’re very much interested in.” This fromSpaulding’s same field man who later in the same conversation said: “It’samazing how gullible John Q. Public really is.”Who’s being gullible here? They took this guy at his word, when he volunteeredfrom out of nowhere, failed to ask even a single skeptical question, and did nolater checking of his tale. A perfect example of selective suspicion—questioneverything against your position, blindly accept all that supports it.I never even knew Allen Dalis until he came to Snowflake to work for Mike. I hadexceptionally high grades. I went to high school at Payson and Snowflake only. Ihave never met the “witness” Spaulding’s field man interviewed. I hadn’tattended a Phoenix school or lived there since right after I finished the fifthgrade at age eleven. What could be easier to verify than residence and schoolattendance? Spaulding could have made simple checks and found out it wasslanderous garbage, but instead he circulated it widely. We finally found outabout it when we were sent a copy from Texas. We then sent a certified letter ofrebuttal, but never heard whether they dropped that one, or if retractionsfollowed.Spaulding invested over a year trying to discredit me. He published reprints ofthe writings of anti-UFO debunkers who attacked me. He gathered irrelevantletters and tapes he hoped would incite legal prosecution, sending them toSheriff Gillespie with a letter urging charges be filed against me, absurdlyattempting to point to a legal precedent by comparing my case to one in whichthe lone female survivor of a plane crash in the forest was prosecuted forsetting a signal fire that got out of control.Even though I’ve mentioned William Spaulding and Ground Saucer Watch (GSW)before this, I’ve delayed making a complete rebuttal of Spaulding’s attacks. Iplace this rebuttal right before my final topic, “debunkers,” because Spauldinghad joined forces with a so-called debunker in his efforts, and several debunkerclaims relied on Spaulding’s inconsistent reports. I may repeat a few thingssaid earlier, but if I can show that debunkers rely on statements and expertisefrom people who can be shown to be without credibility, so goes their case, too.(In making my case, I make no personal attack on anyone. I here address onlystatements and credentials directly related to the issue.)Sheriff Gillespie states unequivocally that GSW and William Spaulding were notcalled in to the investigation by law enforcement agencies, as GSW claimed inthe February 1976 issue of Flying Saucer Review. On the contrary, on November10, 1975, Spaulding sent a letter to Gillespie: “GSW offers its completeinvestigation staff at your disposal, [sic] if you feel we can assist you.”Spaulding was asked by Dr. J. Allen Hynek to relay information to him. Hyneklater told me: “I guess I sent the wrong man in on this one.” Hynek also laterwrote to Spaulding, chastising him for his character assassination tacticsagainst me. Two other GSW people from New Mexico preceded him to the site;Spaulding did not arrive on the site until November 9, the fourth and last dayof the search (the day before he offered his services; it’s obvious he wasn’t“called in” by the sheriff.).Spaulding made a detailed grid map of the site on which he plotted out someextraordinary readings of residual magnetism, which according to theory isconsistent with the recent presence of extraterrestrial vehicles powered byantigravity engines. His charts, which he sent to APRO, showed +8 Gauss at theslash-pile near where the craft hovered, and +10 to +12 Gauss in the areadirectly behind that (opposite the direction of its departure). Normal readingsof the surrounding ground and trees ranged from +1 to -2. But on the side of theclearing across from where the craft hovered (in the direction it departed),Spaulding reported recording a whopping -15 Gauss. ANIS TM Gaussmeters, modelnumbers 25 and 20B were used, but it’s not certain whether Spaulding or his twofield people made the measurements and follow-ups a week later, which showed theanomalous readings had dissipated to normal. I do not know what equipment wasused to take the ozone readings.Spaulding never spoke to any of the six crewmen, yet claimed in the press, “Wehave uncovered some more data in the form of the medical condition of the sixwitnesses. There was nausea, loss of acuteness, which is temporary blindness,and a body rash.” None of the men reported these symptoms directly to Spaulding.To my knowledge none ever met Spaulding. Nevertheless, he made many positivestatements (“We found some interesting things up there. If this is a hoax, it’sone of the best I’ve ever seen.”) to the press concerning the case, right upuntil the moment he realized he had lost my cooperation in investigating thecase.He abruptly switched to attacking the case with vague references to “some holesin the story” and “some questions” and other “factors” that caused him to have“doubts.” From the Tucson Daily Citizen: “William Spaulding, head of GroundSaucer Watch, a Phoenix-based UFO investigation group, said he had informationleading him to disbelieve Walton’s story. Spaulding did not reveal theinformation, but said a statement from his group was forthcoming.”I believe he didn’t “reveal the information” because he didn’t have any newinformation. But the media were pressing him for something specific to explainhis switch. At first all he and Steward could come up with was accusations of“noncooperation” and “refusal to undergo scientific testing.” But of course Iwas undergoing examination—but with their rival, APRO. They needed some betterargument.Spaulding made one last-ditch attempt to reacquire the investigation, coming toDuane’s house with more substantial corroboration for the case—a small, clearplastic pill bottle containing some unusual-looking fragments. Spaulding claimedhe had picked them up at the site, from the ground over which the UFO hadhovered.Duane was suspicious. The sheriff's men had made a careful forensic search ofthe area without finding any similar fragments in the four days before Spauldingarrived. No one had seen Spaulding pick them up. And he hadn’t said a word aboutthem to anyone before this, even though he had reported other evidence of theUFO. Although it was possible the fragments were genuine, Duane was notpersuaded; he made it clear that APRO was in and GSW out. Duane kept the mysterysample, probably much to Spaulding’s dismay. His apologies about “misquotes inthe press” fell on deaf ears. He left angry.Spaulding offered another batch of vague charges to the media, adding the angrythreat: “We’re going to blow this story out today!” But he needed a chargeagainst us. Even though GSW’s initial attack hadn’t mentioned “drughallucination,” all of a sudden “Dr.” Steward “remembered” details of our visit.(Since Steward claimed to “teach drug abuse [sic] at Maricopa Tech,” this wasthe logical charge.) He told the news media: “The story is an absolute hoax;[Walton’s] been out hallucinating on some drug, probably LSD.” What garbage.For all Spaulding’s failings, he had seemed almost clairvoyant in giving Duaneadvice concerning what to do in the event of my return (an event not in any waycertain at that point): save the first voided urine specimen, and bag myclothing for forensic analysis. The urine sample, Spaulding had said, would beneeded to counter what he anticipated would be accusations of a drughallucination. Why would he think this likely? Perhaps because people were stillrecovering from the late sixties and early seventies when every time somethingreally bizarre hit the news it was explained away by “drugs.” But it was fromSpaulding’s organization that this accusation soon came. Coincidence?Later, after hearing about the mark on my arm, Steward claimed to have seen itduring our visit. Then when it was proved I had worn long sleeves to his office,he falsely claimed that due to the heat I had them rolled all the way up abovethe elbow. He claimed to recognize the mark as an injection, yet a genuinephysician had noted that it was not over any major blood vessel. Steward claimedto be able to tell I was still heavily under the influence from a five-day bingeof hallucinogens while in his office, yet blood and urine samples tested a fewhours later by the Maricopa County Medical Examiner’s drug screen showed notrace of any drug. Steward then claimed all traces could vanish from the bodythat quickly. It’s now common knowledge, because of widespread workplacetesting, that evidence of drug use can be detected weeks or months later. Drugexpert indeed.Readers may wish to refer to the descriptions of these events in chapter 7 inevaluating this part. Recall that when Duane renewed contact with Mr. Spaulding,who directed us to GSW consultant, “Dr.” Lester Steward, it was for medical help.Spaulding and Steward went on to claim variously that we “hurriedly” leftSteward’s office in alarm at hearing that Steward was a drug expert, or, inanother version, because we were afraid of hypnosis: “They can’t lie throughhypnosis.” Then, apparently to counter the medical credentials issue, theyclaimed the whole reason we had come to Steward’s office in the first place wasfor “hypnosis experiments.”How could we be going there for hypnosis while being scared off by hypnosis? IfI was so scared of hypnosis, why did I undergo hypnosis with APRO only hourslater? Spaulding claimed I had been “interrogated” at GSW “headquarters” forhours. Totally untrue; the timetable is documented with a call to the sheriffbefore we left and one from Coral Lorenzen after our return. I said almostnothing in the brief time I was in Steward’s office. Spaulding’s stationerygives his home address as GSW Headquarters’, where I have never been in my life.(He really could get pretentious, putting on airs with important-soundinglanguage. He told the press that “GSW headquarters had ordered him to drop thecase.” Spaulding was GSW headquarters!)Why didn’t the press ask the obvious questions? “How can it be a hoax and ahallucination at the same time?” “How can six other men have identicalhallucinations, down to the last detail?” “How can a hoax, which would have tobe planned, be part of a drug hallucination, which no one can control?” Pressedabout his claim to medical and doctoral degrees, Steward eventually had to backoff “doctor” and “psychologist,” but continued to boast no less than threePh.D.s, in “health science, psychology, and physiology,” from California WesternUniversity of Santa Ana, California.APRO checked it out. No California academics in the APRO membership had everheard of the school. When it was located by telephone, APRO’s caller got ananswering service. APRO sent someone down there. No campus, no catalog, noaccreditation, a claimed faculty of twelve, and a very evasive spokesman. This“university” was only two years old in 1975. How did Steward get three Ph.D.sfrom a school only two years old? All three “degrees” were based on a singleresearch paper that was called “freshman level” by individuals described by APROas qualified academics who read it. Some expert.Bill Spaulding had been billed as an “aerospace engineer.” Everyone accepted itbecause he worked for AIResearch, a high-tech aerospace company. But by now hehad really overhyped himself, as this letter from ufologist and nuclearphysicist Stanton T. Friedman makes damningly clear.Mr. William Spaulding(address)Phoenix, AZSeptember 10, 1979Dear Bill:This is one of the more difficult letters I have ever written, but please bearwith me.1. As you know, I have admired your dynamic approach to ufology, yourwillingness to speak out and to not be a closet ufologist or an apologistufologist. I am also all for a scientific approach to evaluation of UFOphotographs.2. I have had several concerns, however, about your activities that led me toquestion whether or not you do indeed have a scientific background:A. Your reasoning and activities in the Heflin picture evaluation and the Waltoncase struck me as not being like those of any of the many engineers with whom Ihave worked over the years.B. There seems to be frequent exaggeration in your public commentary. I don'tbelieve that there are five hundred professional people associated with yourgroup, for example.C. I can't understand how no college was associated with you in the backgroundin the 1977 MUFON Symposium volume but Bowling Green is mentioned in 197 9 andthen you told me and others that you have a B.S. from BG. Why wasn't itmentioned before? How come when I asked for the year, you said 1961-62? When Iasked for the major you mentioned a list of subjects. It has been my experiencethat everybody remembers the year of their first college degree and that nobodywho has one gives a course list as a major.3. For the above reasons and others—such as your not giving adequate credit toothers for the CAUS suit and apparently taking credit for the release ofdocuments not part of that suit, I decided to do some checking to evaluate mysuspicion.4. Here are my findings:A. According to your employer your job title is that of a high-level technicianand in no way implies an engineering degree or background.B. According to your employer the only post high school education you have is aone-year certificate in electronics from Griswold Technical Institute inClevelandC. According to Griswold you attended a twelve-hour-per-week electronics coursefrom March to May 1961, for seven weeks, but did not complete the course and didnot receive a grade or certificate.D. According to Bowling Green University you have not received any degrees fromthem and have not completed any courses at any of their campuses.5. Please correct any of the above findings if they are in error. Please alsounderstand that I do not believe it is necessary to have a college degree to bea competent UFO researcher. One of the best bosses of research I have ever hadhad only a high-school diploma and yet directed many people with Ph.D.s. Thepoint is that apparently you have seriously misrepresented your background. Idon't believe that fraud should have any place in dealings with the public, themedia, or colleagues. I think you should seriously consider setting the recordstraight and should henceforth cease and desist from making any claims that arenot totally accurate. I have no present plans to make my findings public butwill consider doing so should you continue the misrepresentation.Anticipating your response and writing in sorrow,Stan FriedmanCC: Walt Andrus, Dr. Bruce Maccabee, Brad Sparks, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, TravisWalton, Jim Lorenzen, Idabel Epperson, Robert PrattSpaulding never responded. Ultimately, even the photo analysis Friedmancomplimented Spaulding on was discredited. A devastating critique of Spaulding’swork written by Jan Herr was published in the June 1977 APRO Bulletin.The “mystery metal” fragments Spaulding supposedly recovered from the site ofthe incident looked like small chips of shiny, silvery, grayish black obsidian,and would have noticeably contrasted with the drab tan earth at the site. Theysupposedly turned out, upon analysis, to be some kind of high-temperaturesilicone—such as one might find at a place like AIResearch.Spaulding then reportedly suggested that “someone” might have dropped them atthe site (again, with no one else finding them in four days of forensicexamination before Spaulding had even arrived). Yeah, and they might never havebeen at the site. Who knows? It’s surprising how little interest this “physicalevidence” stimulated in either UFO proponents or debunkers.Speaking of debunkers, although one debunker with whom Spaulding had joinedforces was hands-off regarding dubious credentials and assertions concerningSpaulding or Steward, it was not out of gratitude for the help. It was only toavoid undercutting his own stacked deck against the case. In fact, this debunkerwas undeterred in publishing a September 1978 “white paper” claiming to exposethe claimed credentials of Spaulding’s right-hand man, Todd Zechel, GSW Directorof Research. Supposedly Zechel claimed to have worked for the CIA and NSA forten years, but the debunker claimed he had discovered that Zechel had insteadspent three years in ordinary army service; six years at a small factory inBaraboo, Wisconsin, as a carpenter and fireman; then worked in a “sex shop” andpornographic bookstore.Not long after these revelations GSW, William Spaulding, his director Zechel,and “Dr.” Steward virtually disappeared from the UFO scene. Both they and theirvicious attacks had been thoroughly discredited. But the damage they did to meremained. Why? Partly because the media rarely backtracks, and partly becausethe debunkers worked hard at keeping those false claims alive.Which brings us to the debunker’s obsession; the last of the six factors in myanalysis of why what ufologists came to regard as the best case on record alsobecame the most attacked.For many years a number of individuals have been yapping and biting around theedges of ufology. Their position: Without any doubt there has never been agenuine UFO sighting by anyone anywhere on Planet Earth in all of human history,and there never will be, and anyone who says otherwise is either mentallyaberrant, foolishly deluded, or deliberately deceptive—maybe all three. Thesepeople presume to title themselves “debunkers” or skeptics. I will show thattheir actions fail to justify either term. Readers will notice that I put“debunker” in quotation marks. That is because the people I refer to don’t somuch remove bunk as create it.Media people are fond of trotting these people out in the name of “balance.”Often, when a UFO researcher appears, journalists feel obligated to“counterbalance” particulars within an issue by giving a forum to people whodismiss the entire issue. Some are of the grudging opinion that debunkers are anecessary evil, like hyenas trailing a herd to weed out the inferior animals.In this model the ufologist and debunker are viewed as opposites, with thejournalist in the middle. Actually, the better ufologists are in the middle,with the debunker on one side, scoffing a priori at every case, and the UFOcultist on the other side, blindly accepting every UFO claim he hears. Blinddisbelief isn’t a whit better than blind belief. Top ufologists do their ownquality control, with their competitive peers providing a further check. Forexample, the late, great Dr. J. Allen Hynek at times resolved upward of 90percent of received UFO reports his organization investigated, reclassifyingthem as IFOs—identified flying objects (the sightings having been explained inprosaic terms).Debunkers promote a myth of ufologist gullibility so extreme that thoselistening only to their claims would be amazed to learn ufologists discoverprosaic explanations for any of the cases they investigate, let alone most ofthem.The journalist’s stated aim would be better served by including ufologist peersof opposing opinion in a given case or issue. Even so, debunkers or so-calledskeptics would have a legitimate place in the discussion if they would adhere tothe principles to which they give lip service. They don’t, as I shallillustrate.One debunker is our chief detractor and author of the worst charges leveledagainst us. I embark here on the most thorough analysis ever put forth inrebuttal of his allegations. I will name this self-proclaimed debunker and takeeach of his charges head-on: his shameless character attacks, his concoctedForest Service Contract Theory attacks, and the entire gamut of his distortionsof our polygraph evidence. Documented facts (most never before made public) willundo his case. Nothing will be left standing.Although he is promoted as a most objective and scientific investigator, I willfully unmask his motivation and methods for the biased and unscientific shamthey are. I make some startling revelations concerning him and those in leaguewith him. I will document his misrepresentations and concealment of positiveevidence. Moreover, I will provide proof of his outright falsehoods and hisscandalous misuse of documents and tape transcripts presented as evidence.This is far more than a routine refutation of a passing article by somemisguided reporter. It is a detailed expose of a massive, multifronted campaignof calculated disinformation perpetrated by a dedicated specialist over a spanof decades. Dealing with his endless convolutions and devious tricks has beenlike wrestling with a stringy mass of tar. In a war of words there is anintrinsic unfairness and inequality between the positions of attack and defense.It’s the principle I express as follows: “It takes thirty seconds to falselyclaim that which requires thirty minutes to completely refute.” A vastunderstatement in the case of this particular person. To untangle all hisinsidious minutia comprehensively would have made it necessary to expendexponentially more ink than the flood he unleashed against us. But even thismeasured counterwork has become truly prodigious.Which presents a dilemma. Such a thorough accounting requires space greatlydisproportionate to the rest of this book. Yet I didn’t undertake this workmerely to tell my story yet another time. I was motivated to the task by severalfactors, one of which was to have nothing less than opportunity to answer everymajor charge against us.Therefore the remainder of the material on this topic begins on page 283 in whathas become an extraordinarily lengthy appendix. Make no mistake, this analysisis not presented for entertainment purposes. It is a mountain of detailedevidence. Faced with a passage of such depth, the casual reader could beforgiven for skimming through it. But in order fully to comprehend my experienceit is essential to stay with me through the entire odyssey.I highly recommend reading the appendix before continuing with the remaining sixchapters.

I told him no,but that, since I don’t keep up with the field, he might or might not beprominent.Tracy told me he’d been receiving a series of phone calls from Black. Tracydescribed Black’s approach as initially courteous, explaining that he wascalling to provide Mr. Torme with certain facts of which Mr. Torme evidentlymust not be aware, but his tone gradually grew more strident. After he’d readthat Fire in the Sky was in production, Black had hastened to advise Tracy ofhis folly.Why in the world, Black wanted to know, would Torme want to make a feature filmabout the Turkey Springs incident, when that case had long ago been proven ahoax?Tracy wanted to know what made him believe that was the case. Black respondedwith great vehemence and certainty, proffering as evidence some of themisinformation clarified in the appendix of this book.Tracy had researched the whole case, including all the old allegations, and wastherefore well aware of the truth of the matter. I can almost hear hisexasperated sigh as he refuted Black’s charges point by point. Although Blackremained staunchly unconvinced of the veracity of my experience, he graduallybegan to realize that it was he who was proceeding on incorrect or incompletedata.I told Tracy that Black’s skeptical litany sounded a whole lot like Spaulding’sand PJK’s line of nonsense. It turned out that, indeed, Black had been a pastassociate of Bill Spaulding and GSW. Apparently PJK had been a major source ofmisinformation—Mr. Black had even cooperated with him on another recent casethat together they had branded a hoax.Although at first Black’s basic conviction concerning our incident remainedunchanged, this initial contact led to a series of long and sometimes heatedphone conversations between himself and Tracy. However, unlike other so-calledinvestigators, Jerry Black did something comparatively radical—he checked thefacts for himself. After all these years, a qualified investigator had reopenedthe case.Mr. Black went back to the key sources of information. He spoke with formersheriff Gillespie, Cy Gilson, McCarthy, Ezell, Mike Rogers, and the ForestService. He discovered for himself that the Contract Theory (See appendix) wasso full of holes it wouldn’t hold a drop of water. Other “theories” crumbled aswell. Valiantly defending his skepticism, he even temporarily considered of allthings, Spaulding’s half real/half hoax scenario. But he kept pushing andlooking, and what he was gradually discovering all on his own was just how muchthe “true facts” had been obscured. His doubts began to waiver.Still, Black returned to harp on certain points, emphasizing the oft-repeateddistortions of the polygraph evidence. Tracy’s exasperation eventually turned toreal annoyance. He told Jerry that if he couldn’t come up with a plausiblealternative scenario, a series of hypothetical events that would fully accountfor everything they both knew to be fact, there wasn’t any point in continuingtheir discussions. Mr. Black said, “Sure, that’s easy.” He tried a couple ofscenarios that Tracy immediately was able to demonstrate were ridiculously outof sync with the indisputable facts of the case.Not long after first phoning me about this new investigator, Tracy asked me toparticipate in a three-way conference call with him and Jerry Black. During theconversation Black took issue with some errors in my first book. One was the“typical day” I’d written of to help illustrate the nature of our work. Anotherwas my error in reporting that Cy Gilson rather than another polygraph expert(see appendix) had perused Pfiefer’s charts, unofficially concurring with hisconclusion.Black also took issue with my assertion that the six witnesses had been givenUFO questions of varied wording rather than all being asked identically wordedquestions. I emphasized that, whatever Gilson remembered, all I could do wasaccurately report what I had been told by the six crewmen, since I had not beenpresent. We went through some points about the McCarthy test invalidity. Blackbasically agreed the test was not credible; but he felt strongly, as a formerAPRO affiliate, that keeping it confidential had been a major misstep of theinvestigation. He then proceeded to the old “dictated questions” nonsense. Icountered that this objection had been unequivocally discounted by Pfieferhimself. Black came back with Ezell’s “unofficial disavowal” of the Pfiefertest. I told him I believed Ezell’s real motive was to defend against a publicperception which he believed would harm his business reputation. I predictedthat Ezell would decline to test anyone concerning UFOs, on the basis of thesubject alone, and challenged Black to test my prediction. (My assessment wassubsequently borne out.)Jerry Black places much stock in the polygraph aspect of any case heinvestigates. His remaining suspicion of my case came down to the testsinvolved. His gentlemanly attack culminated, during that telephone conferencecall, when Black asked me if I would be willing to take an all-new polygraphtest.I asked him why I should take another test when I’d already passed one. Hecriticized the validity of the Pfiefer test; I defended it. I acknowledged thatmisinformation might interfere with an investigator’s perception of the test,but that if he would check, he’d find out I was right about the disputed points.Black persisted. What would be the harm in a new test? All it could do wasstrengthen my position. I retorted that if I agreed to new testing, archskepticswould attack anew; then another test would be deemed “necessary” to defend theprevious one, and so on. Why open the door to that? Besides, a new test wouldamount to an implicit admission that the test I had already passed had beensomehow insufficient. Why should I make such a concession to my critics, whennothing would ever satisfy them anyway?I had nothing to gain. I would pass, but if the smallest thing went wrong withthe way the test was conducted, it would be jumped on and magnified by mycritics. Even if the test was flawless, it really would add nothing to mycredibility in their minds.Jerry Black remained insistent. He said he didn’t like it at all when thesubjects of his investigation are unwilling to take a polygraph. Their merewillingness or unwillingness is a big factor in his judgment of a case. I toldhim I did not wish my life to become one long cross-examination. A point isreached where one says: There it is, take it or leave it. I felt I had reachedthat point.My answers didn’t seem to satisfy Jerry Black, but I ended the call with arepeat of my challenge for him to verify what I was saying about the Pfiefertest. He didn’t take me up on the part of my challenge that Ezell’s problem waswith the UFO subject, not the test results themselves, and that asking Ezell toadminister a new test would prove that. Black said that, judging from his talkswith Ezell, that wasn’t really all that implausible anyway. But he did take meup on verifying my explanations about the Pfiefer test with Pfiefer himself.After our call he did some sleuthing around and was finally able to locateGeorge Pfiefer, who did indeed, Jerry told Tracy, personally verify what I hadsaid about how his tests were conducted.Even so, Jerry Black pursued further polygraph testing, switching his efforts toMike Rogers. Mike at first resisted on grounds similar to mine. Wouldn’t a newtest imply that the original tests of the six crewmen somehow had been faulty?Such a doubt would open the door to retesting all six. What if someone couldn’tbe found, or didn’t want to bother? I too was initially against new testing foranyone.But Jerry persuaded Mike that at the very least, retesting Allen Dalis would dothe old tests no damage. The only one among the nine people previously testedwho had not officially passed, his test would serve as a benchmark to confirmthe adequacy of the UFO question in the earlier testing.Jerry Black selected Cy Gilson as the examiner. I agreed that he was the bestlogical choice to test Allen. Allen’s passing a test with the same examinerwould resolve his original inconclusive test and complete the series—all sixwitnesses would have passed with the same examiner.Cy Gilson was now one of the top examiners in the nation—the top examiner inArizona, by virtue of his twenty-two continuous years of experience, sixteen ofthose years spent on criminal testing for the Department of Public Safety (thestate police). Even after he entered private practice, most of his work was inthe area of criminal examinations; because of his reputation and experience,prosecutors, lawyers, and police throughout the state still came to him forimportant work. Criminal polygraph work entails one’s recognition in court as anexpert witness and is considered the high-status end of the field, as opposed toself-employed storefront operators performing mostly routine preemployment andmarital fidelity tests. In addition, all of Cy Gilson’s experience was withmodern Control Question Tests (CQT), state-of-the-art methodology.When I told Tracy we were considering retesting Allen Dalis, his response wasless than enthusiastic. “Like you told Jerry Black, what if it turns out to beone of those few percent of tests that falsely accuse? What if Allen gotnervous? You know how emotionally hyper he gets.” Tracy recommended againsttesting for anyone involved. The movie was to be released soon. He believed, atthis point, there was little to gain, much to lose.His point was valid, as far as it went; but Gilson’s credentials wereimpeccable. If anyone could properly test Allen, he could. So I didn’t raise thesubject again with Tracy, and never said anything to Paramount. Plans wentahead, with great caution exercised in every aspect of the arrangements. Theonly point in doing this was if absolutely everything was beyond reproach.Self-sponsored tests are not as highly regarded as independently sponsoredtests. Those sponsored by skeptical third parties rate highest of all. Inexercising his right as sponsor of the test, Jerry Black formulated a series ofairtight question areas for Allen’s test, with specific wording to be worked outby Cy Gilson—open, of course, to possible refinement with Allen, but nonethelesssubject to Gilson’s final approval.It was left to Mike Rogers to persuade Allen Dalis to submit to retesting. Afterconsiderable trouble I had located Allen some months earlier for Paramount; butother than that brief phone call, Mike’s call was the first contact we’d hadwith him in many years. But Allen didn’t need much coaxing. He knew what he’dseen, and felt he’d been unfairly judged as the only \"inconclusive.” He welcomedthe chance to vindicate himself.Throughout the arrangements, Jerry Black was pushing to include others in aretest. Mike had been considering this for himself. Mike was gradually persuadedin principle, but still resisted, wary of appearing to devalue the originaltests on the crew. He eventually offered to undergo retesting if Gilson wouldagree to comment in his report that the test was supplemental to the earliertesting. Gilson flatly refused, saying nobody tells him how to conduct histests, and nobody tells him what to write in his report. Mike finally settledfor a letter, under separate cover, reaffirming Gilson’s final opinion of hisearlier testing of the six:30 January 1993Mr. Michael H. Rogers(Address)Show Low, ArizonaDear Mr. Rogers,This letter is in regard to the polygraph examinations I administered to you andfive other men in November of 1975, about the disappearance of Travis Walton andthe UFO incident.The results of the examinations I administered in 1975 determined you and fourof the other men were being truthful to the four relevant questions asked duringthat examination. The sixth man's examination was inconclusive, in that hischart tracings were such that no determination of truth or deception could bemade.Today, in 1993, I am still of the same opinion that they were valid examinationsand the results were conclusive on the five. Even though there was only onequestion asked that related to the UFO sighting, it was a valid question and theresults proved none of you were lying when stating you saw an object that youbelieve was a UFO.The other three relevant questions asked during that examination were todetermine if any of you had caused the death of Travis Walton. Again the resultsof the five examinations were conclusive and that none of you did anything norsaw anyone do anything to injure or kill Travis Walton. The results of thesethree relevant questions were positively verified when Mr. Walton reappearedabout a week after these polygraph examinations were administered.I hope this letter will satisfy you, and anyone else, that my beliefs in theresults of those examinations, are the same today as they were in 1975.Sincerely,Cy GilsonAt Jerry Black’s urging, Mike tried to talk me into joining him and Allen inbeing retested. I held firm, repeating my reasoning. But once Mike had beenpersuaded to commit himself to being retested, he became an avid proponent ofbroadening participation. He wouldn’t let up on me. He enthusiastically tickedoff Cy Gilson’s credentials and the improvements in sensitivity and reliabilityof modern equipment. I agreed that Cy Gilson was the top examiner; it wasvirtually certain we’d get an accurate test. My concerns were with gettingdragged into defending against a new round of unfair attacks. I still felt I hadnothing to gain. I reasoned that if only one test in three hundred gaveinaccurate results, that it would be the equivalent of playing Russian roulette.If there was any possibility of destroying yourself, with nothing to gain, whywould any sane person play? Even if there were two hundred ninety-nine emptycylinders instead of five, there was still that one live round.Mike and Jerry would confer, then Mike would come back at me. His reasoning hada gradual effect on me. But what really clinched it for me, at the last moment,was when Mike told me that Cy Gilson had expressed his opinion that both theMcCarthy test and the Pfiefer test were inconclusive, for the same reason—theirsame, obsolete methodology. I’d never before realized that Pfiefer had beenusing the same method for which McCarthy’s test had been invalidated. Pfieferhad used a few newer refinements, making his test seem different fromMcCarthy’s. All I’d known was that McCarthy’s had been called “an old militarymethod.”I now know that the validity of Pfiefer’s test can still be justifiablydefended, because the methodology’s inaccuracy in virtually all cases leans inthe direction of false positives. But at the time the thought that I hadn’t yettaken an unassailable test gave me pause.I finally agreed to undergo reexamination by polygraph. I had other business inPhoenix anyway. Before arriving at his office complex that day, I’d never seenor spoken to Cy Gilson. I pulled up a chair and we got down to business.We resolved a few minor issues, then I told him I wanted to take a drug testboth before and after my test. Gilson said that wasn’t necessary. I insisted,saying that I would pay the additional cost myself. Gilson said that since itwasn’t ever needed he didn’t know how to go about having such tests done. (Yearsbefore, PJK had made drug tests a part of our polygraph retest challenge, so I’dthought they were necessary for an airtight test.) Gilson explained that thebelief that drugs could help a liar pass a polygraph test was a myth. Researchhad proven no drug could ever neutralize a subject’s autonomic nervous reactionsto deception on relevant questions, while simultaneously having no effect onreactions to “known lie” and “directed he” questions. That was one of thetremendous advantages of modern CQT methodology.I said I wanted to be absolutely certain that no one could ever claim any basisto attack this test for any reason. Gilson assured me, the lack of druginfluence was well established. Since some misinformed subjects had thought thiswould work, he’d seen such attempts—he could easily spot a drugged reactionchart—and the result is as far from a passed test in appearance as would beintense stress reactions to relevant questions. No drug effect can be repeatedlyturned on and off in a matter of seconds. Many years of research had been done,and if there was any way chemicals could defeat a test, drug tests would havebecome a standard part of the procedure. Critics wouldn’t get too far with suchan attack if no knowledgeable polygraph expert would substantiate theirunderlying premise. I finally relented—Gilson’s logic was unassailable.We had a lengthy pretest interview. I went through a description of myexperience. He took notes, and asked many questions. His questions weren’t inthe nature of a cross-examination. They rather appeared to be directed atestablishing a mutual understanding of the facts as I stated them to be. Heshowed neither belief nor disbelief, only concern with my being clear about thetruth of what I was saying.Cy Gilson formulated in his own words questions based on Jerry Black’sguidelines. I exercised great care never to suggest specific changes in theirwording, but raised one or two minor points on which a given question exhibitedambiguity to me, but left them entirely up to the examiner to resolve however hesaw fit.We went through the other standard procedures, then took a short break before Iwas strapped into the chair. It seemed like hours before my testing wascomplete.No hint of what he’d read on my charts showed in his face. Not that I needed tobe told, assuming there were no glitches. It probably took less than an hour, ashe scanned the charts and computer readouts, but it seemed longer as I silentlywaited for his preliminary conclusion. Finally, he told me with no trace ofemotion what I already knew was nearly certain. Although subject to continuedevaluation as to exact scores, my charts were clearly within the upper range oftruthfulness.We broke for lunch and returned for more testing. I’d been disappointed to learnthat modern methodology considered only four questions to be optimum. I hadother areas I wished to cover. My first test that day had covered the incidentcomprehensively, but I wanted to address specific allegations by my criticswhich couldn’t be perfectly refuted in any other way. Mike had wanted his ForestService Contract Theory stuff specifically covered in a second test. I pointedout that all those questions had been fully addressed in the questionnaireMaurice Marchbanks (see appendix) was answering. I’d argued that if JerryBlack’s budget would only cover one person getting a second test, then as theperson at the center of all the allegations I ought to be that one.Cy Gilson really didn’t see any necessity for either of us to have a secondtest. In his opinion, no subissue could elude the four interlocking relevantquestions we had each already answered. We simply could not pass those and belying about any of the other issues. In fact, one reason recommended procedurefocused on only four questions was that almost any issue could be completelyaddressed by four properly worded questions. Nevertheless, it ultimately wasagreed that I would undergo a second test.When we began my second pretest interview, I enumerated a half dozen areas Iwanted covered. Gilson deleted a couple as either already covered by some of theother questions or not central to the issue. Again, I was very careful tosuggest changes only in the most general fashion. And again Cy Gilson formulatedthe questions according to his own judgment and proper principles of practice.And finally, again, when it was all over he gave me his favorable preliminaryverdict for my second test.You can imagine my feelings as I headed home. It occurred to me that ultimatelyI’d kept my appointment for a polygraph test with Gilson, though not verypunctually.Allen’s and Mike’s testing had been conducted without any problems on February1, 1993. Great care was exercised to avoid even the appearance of any possibleimpropriety. Mike had stayed overnight in Phoenix to pick up his own polygraphreport. Therefore he had been unable to attend a surprise birthday party thrownfor me at my home. (My wife, Dana, had called me from the college where shetaught aerobics to tell me she couldn’t get the car started. I headed over thereand the guests moved into the house as soon as I rounded the corner. She got me.I never expected a thing. It was great.) Coincidentally, my test with Pfieferalso had been right after my birthday. seventeen years earlier.Allen had already completed his test when Mike arrived at Gilson’s office.They’d spoken on the phone in getting the tests arranged, but it was the firsttime they’d laid eyes on each other in many years. Allen had showed up at theagreed time, and evidently conducted himself properly on this occasion, becauseeverything went well. His new test and the one he took back in 1975 were theonly polygraph tests Allen had ever taken. Mike’s test was routine andnaturally, reflecting the truth as well as his first test had, more thanseventeen years earlier.Before long, I had copies of all three completed official polygraph reports inmy hand. They don’t come any better than this. Here’s what I read:4 February 1993Mr. Jerry Black(Address)Blanchester, OhioDear Mr. Black,On February 4, 1993, a polygraph examination was administered to Mr. AllenDalis. The purpose of this examination was to determine Whether or not Mr. Daliswas being truthful in his statement about witnessing a UFO-like object in theforest near Heber, Arizona, on November 5, 1975. The object will be referred toin the balance of this report as a UFO.During the pretest interview, Mr. Dalis related the following events thatoccurred on that day. Mr. Dalis said they had finished work for the day and wereheading home. It was almost dark. He saw a glow coming from among the treesahead of them. As they came to a clearing, he saw the object he called a UFO.Mr. Rogers was slowing the truck down to stop as Travis Walton exited the truckand began to advance towards the UFO in a brisk walk. Before reaching the UFOMr. Walton slowed to a normal walk.Mr. Dalis described the UFO as being a yellowish white in color. He said thelight emitting from it was not bright but a glow that gave off light all arounditself. He equated it to the glowing light you get from a lamp with the shade onand the light shining all around.Mr. Dalis saw Walton reach the UFO, stop and look up at it. He said it looked asif Walton was standing there, slightly bent over, with his hands in his pockets.Mr. Dalis said the UFO began to wobble or rock slightly and he began to becomeafraid. He put his head down towards his knees. As he did so, a bright lightflashed that lit up the area, even the inside of the truck. He immediatelylooked towards the UFO. He saw a silhouette of Walton. Mr. Walton had his armsup in the air. Mr. Dalis cannot be sure if Walton was off of the ground at thattime.Mr. Dalis turned towards Mr. Rogers who was in the driver's seat and yelled forhim to \"get the hell out of here.\" They drove to the main forest road andstopped. He believes some of the crew got out of the truck and others stayed init. They talked about what they had witnessed and the concern for Walton. It wasdecided to return to the area and help Walton.When they arrived at the scene, Mr. Walton was nowhere to be found. [Mr. Dalis]said all of the crew got out of the truck and walked shoulder to shouldertowards the area where the UFO was seen. They could not find Mr. Walton nor anysign of him. They then drove to town and reported the incident to the Sheriff'sOffice.During the review of the questions, Mr. Dalis understood all of the questions.He understood #R3 to mean any conversation with Walton either by telephone or inperson and any visual contact, even if they did not speak to each other.The relevant questions asked and the answers given are as follows:Question #R1:On November 5, 1975, in the forest near Heber, did you see an object that youbelieve was a UFO?Answer: YES.Question #R2:Did you conspire with the Walton brothers or anyone else to perpetrate a hoaxabout that UFO sighting in 1975?Answer: NO.Question #R3:Between November 6 and 10 of 1975, when Travis Walton was missing, did you haveany verbal or personal contact with him?Answer: NO.Question #R4:In the past seventeen years, has anything occurred to cause you to now believethat UFO incident was a hoax?Answer: NO.Mr. Dalis' physiological responses were monitored during the presentation ofthese questions by means of a Scientific Assessment Technology's Computer, ModelCAPS 700. The following responses were recorded on this instrument's stripchart: relative blood pressure; skin conductance; thoracic and abdominalrespiration. Data from three presentations of these questions were obtained andsubject to numerical scoring and computer-based analysis.The numerical score after three charts was +22. In the system of numericalscoring developed and validated at the University of Utah, total numericalscoring of +6 or more is considered indications of truthfulness. Thecomputer-based analysis returned a posterior probability of truthfulness of.993, indicating that charts like these produced by Mr. Dalis, are produced bytruthful examinees 99% of the time.Based on the numerical score of the polygraph charts and the computer-basedanalysis, it is the opinion of this examiner that Mr. Dalis was being truthfulwhen he answered these relevant questions.Sincerely,Cy Gilson1 February 1993Mr. Jerry Black(Address)Blanchester, OhioDear Mr. Black,On February 1, 1993, a polygraph examination was administered to Mr. MichaelRogers. The purpose of this examination was to determine whether or not Mr.Rogers was being truthful in his statement about witnessing a UFO-like object inthe forest near Heber, Arizona, on November 5, 1975.During the pretest interview, Mr. Rogers related the following events thatoccurred on that day. He and his crew of six men had worked late on that day. Itwas after sundown as they were driving back to town. Nearing a clearing to theright of the truck, they saw an object that is commonly referred to as a UFO.This object will be referred to during the balance of this report as a UFO. Asthe truck neared the clearing, Mr. Rogers slowed the truck to a stop. Mr. TravisWalton exited the truck and walked fast towards the object. Mr. Rogers was onthe opposite side of the truck from the UFO. He had to bend over slightly toview it in its entirety through the truck windows.He described the UFO to be glowing a yellowish tan color. He could not say ifthe light emanated from within the UFO or was a lighting system outside, thatlit up the UFO. He did say he could see the shadows of the trees on the ground,around the UFO. He said it was round and about SO feet in diameter. He said theUFO was about 75 to 100 feet from the truck.He saw Walton walk near to the UFO, stop near some logs and brush and wasstanding there looking up at it. At this time Mr. Rogers decided to move thetruck due to the fact they were becoming frightened. As Mr. Rogers started tomove the truck a brilliant flash of light lit up the entire area, even insidethe truck. It was described as a prolonged strobe flash. He did not see a beamof light emit from the UFO and hit Walton.As the flash occurred, Mr. Rogers turned around in his seat to look at the UFOagain and saw Mr. Walton being hurled through the air in a backwards motion,falling on the ground, on his back. At this time, Mr. Dalis and someone elseyelled to get the hell out of here. Mr. Rogers drove the truck along thesecondary road until he came to the main forest road where he stopped. A briefdiscussion took place and it was decided to return to the area to help Mr.Walton.Upon returning to the same place, they all exited the truck and advanced towardsthe place where they had seen the UFO. There was no sign of Walton nor anyindication of Walton being injured, such as blood on the ground. There were noburns of the vegetation in the area where the UFO hovered. Not being able tofind Walton with the aid of a few flashlights, they decided to go to Heber andnotify the Sheriff's Office of what had just occurred.During the review of the questions, Mr. Rogers understood the content of all therelevant questions and in particular, that question #R3 meant any type ofconversation either in person or by telephone and any visual contact with Waltoneven if they did not speak. He understood \"conspire\" to mean any planning or hisknowledge of any planning to perpetrate a UFO hoax.The relevant questions asked and the answers given are as follows:Question #R1:On November S, 1975, in the forest area called Turkey Springs, did you see alarge, glowing object hovering in the air below the treetops about 100 feet fromyou?Answer: YES.Question #R2:After the bright flash of light did you see Travis Walton propelled backwardsthrough the air?Answer: YES.Question #R3:Between November 5 and 10 of 1975, when Travis Walton was reported missing, didyou have any verbal or personal contact with him?Answer: NO.Question #R4:Did you conspire with the Walton brothers or anyone else to perpetrate a hoaxabout that UFO sighting in 1975?Answer: NO.Mr. Rogers' physiological responses were monitored during the presentation ofthese questions by means of a Scientific Assessment Technology's Computer, ModelCAPS 700. The following responses were recorded on this instrument's stripchart: relative blood pressure; skin conductance; thoracic and abdominalrespiration. Data from three presentations of these questions were obtained andsubject to numerical scoring and computer-based analysis.The numerical score after three charts was +31. In the system of numericalscoring developed and validated at the University of Utah, total numericalscoring of +6 or more is considered indications of truthfulness.The computer-based analysis returned a posterior probability of truthfulness of.990, indicating that charts like these produced by Mr. Rogers, are produced bytruthful examinees 99% of the time.Based on the numerical score of the polygraph charts and the computer-basedanalysis, it is the opinion of this examiner that Mr. Rogers was being truthfulwhen he answered these relevant questions.The truthful outcome of this examination tends to validate the truthful resultsof the single question I asked, regarding this incident, during the originalexamination of Mr. Rogers in 1975.Sincerely,Cy Gilson4 February 1993Mr. Jerry Black(Address)Blanchester, OhioDear Mr. Black,On February 4, 1993, a polygraph examination was administered to Mr. TravisWalton. The purpose of this examination was to determine whether or not Mr.Walton was being truthful in his statement about seeing a UFO and being abductedby the UFO plus other facts surrounding the abduction.During the pretest interview, Mr. Walton said he had worked for Mike Rogersintermittently for about six years on a seasonal basis. He never socialized withany of the crew.On November 5, 1975, they had worked a little later than usual trying to meetthe contract commitment. By the time they were driving back to town, the sun hadgone down but there was some light, like twilight.As they were driving, he could see a glimmer of light in the trees ahead. Atfirst he thought it may be a downed airplane. The light was unusual. As theyneared a clearing he saw the object he called a UFO. This object will bereferred to as a UFO throughout this report.As the truck came to a stop, Mr. Walton got out. Believing it may take off, hewalked briskly towards the UFO but slowed his pace before reaching it. Hedescribed it as being round and hovering about SO feet above the ground. He didnot go underneath it but stood there looking up at it. He said the UFO startedto wobble slightly and make a noise. Mr. Walton said the noise was like a lowrumble that developed into a higher pitch that seemed to increase in frequency.At this point he became afraid and decided to go back to the truck. He recallsbeing hit with an electrifying type of shock that stunned him, leaving himunconscious.He recalls he slowly regained consciousness. He found himself in a small roomthat was damp or humid. He had pain throughout his body but mostly in his chestand head. He then saw three creatures he described as being about four feet tallwith large, dark eyes. He was lying on some type of table. As these creaturesapproached him he got off the table. There was some type of shelf near the wallwhere he found a straight pipe-like object lying on it. He describes it as beinground like a piece of pipe but lightweight. He cannot recall if it was solid orhollow. He picked it up and started to lash out at the creatures to keep them atbay. The creatures left the room by an open doorway, turning right.Mr. Walton walked to that doorway, looked down a hall and he went left. Hewalked into another room, trying to find an exit from this enclosure. He did notknow if he was in a spaceship or a building. A human-like creature came into theroom, took him by the arm, leading him to another very large room where severalmore human-like creatures were. By this time most of the pain was gone. He wasforced down on a table and had a mask, similar to an oxygen mask, put on hisface. He does not remember anything else until he awoke next to the road, justoutside Heber. As he regained consciousness, he looked up, seeing the UFO or onesimilar to the original one, hovering overhead. As he looked up at it, the UFOsped off into the sky.Mr. Walton said his story is true. He said accusations made about him are lies.He had not been on any drugs of any kind. He was not hiding out somewhere on theGibson ranch. He urinated in a jar and this sample was given to Dr. Kandelllater that same day. Mr. Walton denies he conspired with Mr. Rogers toperpetrate a hoax to help him get out of the Turkey Springs contract with theForestry Service.Two series of questions were asked to cover all the areas we believe wereimportant.The relevant questions asked and the answers given are as follows:Series #1:Question #R1:On November 5, 1975, in the forest area called Turkey Springs, did you see alarge glowing object hovering in the air?Answer: YES.Question #R2:While you were standing near that UFO-like object, did you believe you werestruck by an energy source emitted from that large object?Answer: YES.Question #R3:After regaining consciousness in a small, humid room, did you see nonhumancreatures with large dark eyes?Answer: YES.Question #R4:Did you conspire with your brother Duane or anyone else or act alone to stage ahoax about your UFO abduction?Answer: NO.Series #2:Question #R1:Between November 1 and 11, 1975, did you use any drugs, either legal or illegal?Answer: NO.Question #R2:Between November 5 and 10, 1975, were you hiding anywhere on the Gibson ranch?Answer: NO.Question #R3:Was the urine sample given to Dr. Kandell on November 11, 1975, your firstvoided specimen following your UFO experience?Answer: YES.Question #R4:Was this UFO incident a conspiracy to help Mike Rogers get out of his TurkeySprings contract?Answer: NO.Mr. Walton's physiological responses were monitored during the presentation ofthese questions by means of a Scientific Assessment Technology's Computer, ModelCAPS 700. The following responses were recorded on this instrument's stripchart: relative blood pressure; skin conductance; thoracic and abdominalrespiration. Data from three presentations of these questions were obtained foreach series, and were subject to numerical scoring and computer-based analysis.The numerical score of Series #1 was +34. The numerical score of Series #2 was+26. In the system of numerical scoring developed and validated at theUniversity of Utah, total numerical scoring of +6 or more is consideredindications of truthfulness.The computer-based analysis returned a posterior probability of truthfulness of.964 in the first series, and a .961 in the second series. These indicating thatcharts like these produced in each series, by Mr. Walton, are produced bytruthful examinees 96% of the time.Based on the numerical score of the polygraph charts and the computer-basedanalysis, it is the opinion of this examiner that Mr. Walton was being truthfulwhen he answered these relevant questions.Sincerely,Cy GilsonThank you, Jerry Black! These examinations clear the air with a thoroughness, anutter finality, which can’t be refuted. Cy Gilson used a widely practiced,extremely accurate, state-of-the-art method developed and perfected at theUniversity of Utah. This involves a computerized monitoring and analysis of thetracings along with a point-scoring system of the charts applied by theexaminer.In summary: The computer put all three of us near the top of the rangedesignated as conclusively truthful (almost no one ever achieves the theoreticalmaximum of 1.00), with me at .964 and .961, Mike at .990, and Allen at .993. Onthe numerical score I was first with +34 and +26 points, Mike had +31 points andAllen had +22 points. Since +6 and up is considered truthful, the minor scoringdifferences between the three of us are of no meaningful significance becausethey are less than the difference you could get from two identical tests on thesame person in the same day.It’s unlikely my critics will be bragging up Cy Gilson’s years of experience,but the fact is, he had more experience when he tested me than McCarthy (hisclaims notwithstanding) actually had at the time he tested me. Gilson wasprobably the best examiner in the state even in 1975, but now no one candispute, by any criteria, his being the top examiner in the state of Arizona. Ifdebunkers surrender their credibility and dare to attack these tests, we canexpect that suddenly years of experience won’t be the crucial factor in apolygrapher’s credentials to them. The truth is, there is absolutely nothingcritics could say that wouldn’t be barefaced hypocrisy at this point. They’vepainted themselves tightly into a corner.Cy Gilson is a top-notch examiner of impeccable integrity and credentials. Nocritic ever made a personal attack on his credentials or conduct relative to mycase. His objectivity can’t be doubted. To this day, I’ve not been able tofigure out where Gilson stands in regard to the UFO issue in general. I know hewas a complete skeptic before November 11, 1975, though the results of our testsmust have had some effect on him. None of us really asked him, because, sincehe’s as professional as they come, his personal opinions outside of his testreports were kept out of it. I might have been spared much aggravation had thesituation worked out so that my first—and only—test had been from him. However,I’m happy that at long last I had the opportunity to set the record straightonce and for all.I had waited to tell anyone at Paramount about the tests until they werecomplete because I wanted to head off any possible suggestions from my criticsthat the studio, because of its financial stake in the movie, had exerted anyinfluence on the results. But the next day I fired off a letter with the news tothe publicity department. It had a more dramatic impact than I had expected.Apparently some of the old, skeptical claims had been affecting attitudes morenegatively than I’d known. Needless to say, everyone was pleased.His investigative experience with us, culminating in our triumphant polygraphs,has made a changed man of Jerry Black—at least regarding his opinion of theTurkey Springs incident. But he didn’t lose, he won—in a big way. Unlike myother critics, he came by his new understanding the “old-fashioned” way—heearned it. Unusual indeed is the man with the objectivity and intellectualhonesty not only to seek the truth in opposition to a strongly-held opinionbut—rarer still—to face it when he meets it. All those he questioned—Ezell,McCarthy, Torme, Pfiefer, Gillespie, the Forest Service officials—can attest tohis skepticism when he entered the investigation. His reversal not only conferscredibility on our incident, but it attests to his own credibility as aninvestigator.Jerry Black admits his new understanding of the Turkey Springs incident camegradually, but that one of the key points of conviction for him was my decisionto undergo new testing by polygraph. He said: “There’s no question in my mindthat the clincher, as far as Travis Walton himself is concerned, was hisagreeability to take the polygraph in the face of realizing that he had reallynothing to gain and everything to lose at this late point and date. The film wasalready made, he had his money; if he was really lying he would have been afool, under the circumstances, to take the test with nothing to gain andeverything to lose. [This] showed me that he had nothing to fear, that in hismind he knew, he had to know that in his mind he was telling the truth as heknew it. He knew full well that it was going to become public record. Thequestions were tight. Everything in the polygraph just confirmed my totalinvestigation.”Well, that’s it. I know I’m done. I’ll never again undergo testing on thisissue. But I have been mulling over the idea of a reunion with the rest of thecrew, and perhaps getting the rest of them repolygraphed. The logistics are alittle daunting, but we’ll see. However, the bottom line is we’ve already provenourselves, nearly to the limit of what’s possible.Look at the case presented by our detractors. Then look at the evidence weprovide. It’s all there on the table. You decide.To obtain an expert opinion on what conclusions could be drawn from thepolygraph tests in the Travis Walton case we interviewed Edward Gelb, Presidentof the American Polygraph Association: “Hundreds of police departments andcorporations throughout the world utilize the polygraph to separate truth fromdeception. The 94-percent accuracy of the polygraph has been well documented,not only in real-life situations as we’ve discussed here, but in laboratory anduniversity studies that have been conducted throughout the world. The oddsagainst six people successfully deceiving a trained polygraph examiner on asingle issue are over a million to one.”—Courtesy of Brandon Chase’s video, UFOs Are Real, 1979"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12SpeculationsMen love to wonder and that is the seed of our science.—EmersonIn writing of the events of my abduction, I’ve tried very hard to stick strictlyto describing the events as I experienced them, not as I interpreted them. I’veremained as objective and factual as possible, refraining from anyembellishments or assumptions of detail, so as not to contaminate the scientificvalue of my experience.However, what occurred inside the craft and the events surrounding my captureand return are not in the least self-explanatory. In fact, in the absence ofconjecture or further data, these events do not seem to make much sense.I’ve been asked countless questions by those keenly desirous of understandingnot only the physical events themselves, but the wider implications, the overallmeaning, of my experience and therefore possibly to gain clues to the mysteriesof the phenomenon in general. Who? What? Why? Where? The uniform answer is thatI do not know. Many of these same questions have continually nagged my own mindsince that November day in 1975.While almost nothing is definitely explained by the events themselves, endlessideas can be inferred from them. The scientific presentation of facts has hadits place. Here is the place for speculations.I do not know which, if any, of the possible scenarios considered here bestcorresponds to reality. The potential for a rough matchup is maintained bysticking to extrapolation of the known facts. However, without more data, thelikelihood of its actually being one of them is probably low. Nevertheless, itis both fascinating and somewhat constructive to try to piece it all together.The questions that arise from the events are obvious; nor can I claimoriginality in formulating most of the theoretical explanations. Naturally, Ihave done much thinking in the search for meaning in my experience. But newsmen,researchers, family, and friends have also advanced many intriguing questions,and suggested still more fascinating answers.Who are these beings? What do they want? Where are they from? Exactly how muchcan we deduce regarding them with the data we have?It’s logical to concentrate first on particulars of my own experience beforeattempting to address the broader questions. Why did they pick the seven of us?Was our being chosen even deliberate? What form of energy did that beam consistof? Why did it strike me? What were the craft’s occupants doing with me? Whywere there two types of beings? Why do I remember only two hours out of fivedays? The questions are endless, but let us explore a few. I want to reemphasizehowever, that at this point it is purely speculation.First of all, why us? Why pick seven ordinary tree-cutters, instead of aworld-renowned scientist or national leader? Or, was our contact only a fluke,entirely unintended beforehand?It’s possible we were singled out. They could have seen us working from highabove the ground and waited near the path by which they knew we would leave. Ifthey did actually choose us from six billion earth people, why? Possibly they donot recognize the kinds of distinctions between persons that we make or considersuch criteria relevant to their purposes. It has occurred to me that they mayhave been attracted to us by somehow overhearing or monitoring our conversationson the job. It might seem presumptuous to think that anything we might say couldbe of any interest to them, but we did philosophize on an incredibly wide arrayof topics during the months out there in the forest—even a brief conversation ortwo about UFOs. So it’s not inconceivable that we inadvertently attractedunwelcome interest.It doesn’t seem to me a biological examination could really be of all that greatuse to them, especially if they have already done so on other humans, but whocould fathom the purposes of such a totally strange civilization? It could bethat they are instituting a “conditioning” program to prepare the people ofearth for the social impact of open contact with other worlds. They have notcompletely disguised their presence. If they have the powers of motion andmemory-erasing that some claim they have, they could easily keep their presence(or visits) completely unknown.Perhaps the growing number of UFO reports characterized by increasingbelievability is intended to accustom us to what the future holds in store. Italmost seems as if UFO occupants control the specific degree of provableness ofreports in terms of the number of witnesses and the amount of evidence leftbehind. The growing acceptance of reports may be deliberately engineered.This could explain the grassroots level of their selection of contactees. Tomake brazen contact by landing on the White House lawn or descending into theKennedy Space Center would be too sudden. Such a jolt of irrefutable evidencemight generate widespread panic, or other unpredictable and negative reactions.Societies might abruptly abandon stable patterns for activities focusing on thenew knowledge. New “cargo cult” sorts of belief systems might be formed.Humankind might focus on prematurely achieving spacefaring sorts of goals,diverting energies best applied elsewhere for now. UFO occupants might want toavoid this for their own good or for ours (or both).One radio announcer I met theorized that aliens might be selectively alteringhuman genetic makeup to change the course of human evolution! After theincident, the entire crew experienced an acute increase in their interest in theopposite sex. But only one of us was abducted, so this is likely only the resultof a psychological release of nervous tension. A couple of the men attemptedregressive hypnosis but were unsuccessful at getting into a trance state. Noneof the men noticed any time loss on the evening of November 5, 1975, that wouldindicate hypnotic repression of events they might have experienced but could notrecall. If their memories had been blocked, then why were not theirs as well asmine completely blocked, so that no one would know the difference? If the aliensare attempting to manipulate the inherited traits of man, for purposes ofimprovement or otherwise, one would think they would somehow do it on a largerscale. There has been growing support of this theory idea among researchers.What if the contact was entirely accidental? We could have simply stumbled upontheir craft hovering over the clearing. They could have been temporarilyincapacitated, stopped for repairs or adjustments. The area was covered withvisually alert deer hunters; they should have been aware they were takingchances of being shot at, or being seen by people other than us, if they werethere deliberately. But then, if they are closer to omniscient than that, theycould have had instruments or other ways of locating every nearby being. Theycould use such knowledge in coordination with tree cover, clouds, and high-speedmaneuvering to make themselves visible (or invisible) to whomever they choose.Maybe the contact was deliberate, but the abduction was accidental. My somewhatfoolhardy approach to that craft could not have been a readily anticipatedreaction. They may have decided on the spur of the moment to kidnap this oddballto see what makes him tick. My sudden approach could have caused them to fire atme in the mistaken impression that I was attacking them. Or an automatic defensemechanism might have fired the beam.Could what these men saw zap Travis Walton actually be the result of phenomenaformed by shifting in the earth’s crust? The Mogollon Rim is a gigantic faultline; perhaps movement deep in the earth released gases that somehow ignited orbecame electrically charged. (Shades of swamp gas.) “Earthquake lights” arewidely reported in association with underground tremors. These are speculated tobe a sort of piezoelectric effect—electrical charges generated by stresses inthe crystalline structure of rock or changes in ground-water flow related tounderground pressure.Dr. Michael Persinger, a professor at Laurentian University of Sudbury, Ontario,Canada, and John Derr, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey inAlbuquerque, New Mexico, say they have a strong statistical analysis showing alink between UFO sightings and quakes.What about ball lightning? A Forest Service expert says the Mogollon Rim areahas the highest number of lightning strikes per year of any area in the UnitedStates except the Florida Everglades. For example, in the three days betweenJune 13 and June 16 of 1993 there were twenty-seven lightning-caused fires inthe Sitgreaves National Forest—and the stormy rainy season doesn’t even beginuntil July. If there’s more lightning, maybe there’s also more of the rare ballform.What about plasmas? Plasmas are gasses in a highly energized state—so energizedthey radiate intense light. Maybe ball lightning is a sort of plasma. In thebasic theory, whichever of the three types of energized balls were actually theUFO, they’re saying Travis Walton could have inadvertently narrowed the gapbetween it and the ground with his body, acting as a sort of lightning rod byproviding a grounding path for the charge. They believe this could perhapscreate bizarre neurological effects like a five-day blackout replete withhallucinations.My experience made me a lightning rod all right, but only in the metaphoricalsense. In the first place, the earth is pretty well networked with seismicdetectors, and as far as I know no tremors were reported. Second, lightningseason was over and the weather was clear and dry—the least likely conditions togenerate or sustain these kinds of atmospheric phenomena. The statisticalanalysis linking UFO reports and earthquakes was criticized because supposedlylarge time lags and distance allowances were thrown in to help make a link morelikely. Also, all these phenomena are as exotic and even more rarely reportedthan UFOs. Remember Occam’s Razor. One doesn’t explain away an anomaly byinvoking an anomaly.How in the world could I be wandering around the woods in an electricallyinduced hallucination for five days and not freeze to death or be found bysearchers? People get struck by lightning every year in this area and when theysurvive they bear unmistakable signs: the hair on their bodies is all singedoff, clothes burned, paramedics have trouble getting vital signs because theirveins are all blown out, and they often have large exit wounds in the bottom oftheir feet. I exhibited none of these effects.How could such a transient phenomenon possess sufficient energy to hover andmove around for minutes, discharge through me without dissipating or leaving thearea, then ten minutes later rise up and streak off into the cloudless nightsky? And it made a tremendous mechanical sound, which doesn’t fit. The bottomline is, as stated elsewhere, what we seven saw had a clearly visible, perfectmechanical structure. What we saw was definitely not a nebulous fireball orglowing cloud of gas.What struck me might have been some sort of electrical static discharge, not anoffensive or defensive weapon. The effect of dry, autumn air moving attremendous speed over the surface of the craft’s metal hull could have caused abuildup of static electricity. Buildups like this are common in airplanes, sothat a grounding wire is always clamped to the plane during refueling to preventthe discharging sparks of electricity from igniting the gasoline. Nearlyeveryone has experienced the shock of touching a grounded metal object aftershuffling across a carpet on a dry day. My close approach could have caused asimilar static charge, only on a gigantic scale.A static charge also could have resulted as a side effect of the propulsion unitthat powers the craft. A charge might have developed merely by the craft’shovering. Or the craft might have suddenly developed a charge—I remember hearinga surge in sound from the craft, like the start-up of powerful engines, justbefore I was struck and blacked out. The occupants of the craft could have beenincreasing the power of their driving unit(s), preparing to leave in response tomy approach.That beam behaved in some ways like a bolt of lightning or electricity, but itmight have been some other form of energy entirely. The beam also could havebeen fired to keep me from getting too close to the craft, from actuallytouching it. The motive might have been to prevent me from being burned by heat,radiation, or some other unknown danger. Or it might have been to prevent mefrom seeing or learning something.Any of those possibilities could also serve to explain my being taken aboard. Ifharm had accidentally befallen me as a result of their presence, they might havefelt responsible for repairing the damage. Even if taking me aboard had beenplanned, perhaps they underestimated the damage of the stunning ray. This mightexplain why I was taken for five days, instead of the few hours usuallyreported, as Coral Lorenzen has suggested.Miracles of advanced medical technology might have been performed on me in thosefive days, if not to repair damage, perhaps for some other purpose. Did thealiens leave that mark on the inside of my right elbow? Perhaps a needle did notpierce me, but some other instrument. A terminal for some electronic device? Itis also entirely possible that the mark was a minor injury I received at workbefore I was abducted.My weight loss is another mystery. I weighed myself on my own scale the verynight I was returned (1:00 a.m., November 11), revealing a loss of over tenpounds since leaving for work the morning of November 5. My scale was latercompared for accuracy to the physician’s scale in Dr. Kandell’s office and foundto register correct weight (unusual for a common bathroom scale).However, Dr. Kandell insists that if a weight-loss is caused by starvation, itresults in the presence of ketones (acetones) in the urine. Ketones were notpresent in my first voided sample, subjected to analysis. But are ketones alwaysfound in the absence of feeding? Or could there be exceptions to this, based onthe patient’s prior body reserves, or perhaps an extremely high or low ambienttemperature? Could virtual immobility in a humid environment further reduceketone production? I have not yet sought expert medical advice in regard to thisquestion.What else could have happened to cause the weight loss? Perhaps my captors didnot know enough of human physiology to provide me with sufficient moisture. Isit possible to lose as much as ten pounds solely from dehydration? I did havemany symptoms of dehydration; but ten pounds of water amounts to over a gallon.I did drink at least that much between my first and second weighings, but normallosses of body-water stores would have continued to some degree. But if notstarvation or dehydration, what was the cause of my weight loss?One obvious question that very often springs to mind, and is asked with someembarrassment: What about the body’s processes of elimination? I was consciousfor less than two hours of those five days; I do not recall either using toiletfacilities or eating in that time. Let’s exercise a little clinical objectivityhere. My underclothes were clean when I returned. My bowel habits are usuallyvery regular, but I did not void urine for approximately ten hours after myreturn, and had no bowel movement for nearly twenty-four hours. Could I haveused a toilet on the craft and not remembered doing so? I don’t recall mybladder pressure during my brief conscious period, but that isn’t the sort ofthing that captures one’s awareness in dangerous situations.Maybe I was fed intravenously while unconscious. Perhaps my body’s metabolicprocesses were somehow lowered to a very slow rate, so that my body experiencedthe five days as only a few hours . . . possibly as a result of a state ofsuspended animation, or some mysterious space-travel time contraction? If so,then why, upon my return, did my face have five days’ growth of beard?My six coworkers missed seeing me taken aboard the craft due to their panickedflight. I lost consciousness when the beam struck me, so how the remainder of myabduction was accomplished remains a mystery. Sheriff Gillespie and his mencarefully searched the ground at the site immediately after the abduction. Theyfound no burn marks, pad impressions, or alien footprints. No footprints ledfrom the spot where I was struck. The ground on that ridgetop was dry and rocky,so there exists a possibility that the craft landed to take me aboard.They also could have hovered close and low, reaching out through an opening inthe craft to pull me inside. Perhaps a mechanical device extended from the craftto me on the ground; maybe even something as unearthly as a levitating ordematerializing beam. Perhaps instead the occupants left the craft by some sortof individual floating or flying method to manually carry me aboard. The meanscould have been something as unsensationally low-tech as a lasso of rope. Was myunconsciousness during both my entry into and exit from the craft a coincidence?Were they trying to hide something? What?My experiences inside the craft seem so much to be fragments of something more,that the number of things that could explain them are of endless variety.When I awoke inside the craft, I assumed I was in a hospital. Possibly nothingmore than my sensation of overwhelming pain inspired that deduction. Maybe anodor in the atmosphere suggestive of a hospital didn’t consciously register; Idon’t recall specific supraliminal awareness of smells while I was conscious.Perhaps I was injured in a way that temporarily impaired my olfactory sense. Thewalls, resembling stainless steel, might have lent the impression of a hospital;most trips I have made to a hospital have been as visitor, not patient, but Ihave noticed an extensive use of stainless steel in those facilities. However, Ido not recall entire rooms so constructed. Perhaps the impressions formed by thepain, the overhead light, and the stainless steel-like walls combined to createthe mental association with a hospital.The false image of being in an earthbound hospital might have been planted in mymind, a hypnotic suggestion to inspire confidence—in case I regainedconsciousness during whatever procedure they were performing. Even if myregaining consciousness was part of their plan, it would have been useful forthem to give me some posthypnotic suggestion, to pacify me with reassuringthoughts.Why did I regain consciousness? If they had expected I would react so violently,wouldn’t I have been restrained somehow? Maybe unfamiliarity with humanphysiology made them fail to anticipate my regaining consciousness.The shock and pain accompanying my awakening should adequately explain mynegative reaction and hysteria. To those disappointed that I didn’t controlmyself and try to learn more, I can but say my reaction was only natural for meunder the circumstances.Why was I kept for five days? And why unconscious? Did my fighting reactiondelay my return by worsening medical problems, or could my behavior have causedsome other difficulty for them? What did they do with me during the long periodI was knocked out?For that matter, what had been the reason for my unconsciousness? Did myawakening occur soon after being struck by the ray, or sometime later during thefive days? If it was later, did the effect of the beam keep me blacked out solong? Or did the beings perpetuate my unconsciousness by other means? If so,why? For medical treatment, tests of some kind, or some other purpose? Was mymuscular weakness and stiffness upon regaining consciousness the effect ofhaving been unconscious and immobile for an extended period? Or did that effecthave some other cause?Most often my questioners are first interested in communication. “Did they talkto you?” No, they did not. I screamed at them, yelled at them, threw a veritableflurry of questions at them. They made no answer. I might have chosen andpresented my questions in a more effective manner. But why were they silent?Were they ignoring me because of my emotional display? Are they not vocalbeings?I know I would have heard them had they spoken, because I could hear my ownvoice, as well as the sound of their movements and of objects in the room. I didnot see their mouths move at any time. I did not even see teeth exposed, if theyhad any. Perhaps their voices were of a frequency to which my ears are notsensitive. They could be telepathic. What if they did not want an accent of somesort to be detected that would suggest something of their origin? They mightsimply not been able to speak or comprehend my language.Did they even have mouths at all? Perhaps they were wearing masks, for disguise,so as not to give away clues to their true origin. Or perhaps their real faceswere even more horrid than the mask, so awful I could not have stood it. Maybethey wore masks, not for disguise, but perhaps in an entire body shield forprotection from the environment or radiation. I remember seeing no fingernailson their hands, which might indicate they were wearing gloves, as part of suchan entire body covering. This might explain their rubbery, marshmallowyappearance: a technologically advanced surgical mask/suit perhaps—either toprotect me from their microbes or themselves from mine (or both).Then again, even the human-looking creatures did not speak to me. At first I hadbelieved that the first man I encountered could not hear me through his helmet.But when I encountered the other three human-looking individuals, who wore nohelmets, they also were noncommunicative, despite my desperate efforts.Although they appeared human in nearly every way, there was something thatdidn’t seem right about their eyes, something very strange. I’ve never been ableto figure out what that was. Perhaps it was something communicated by expressionor subtle movements which do not match our eye functions; maybe somethingstructural like pupil shape, size, proportion of subparts, coloring, or lightreflectivity; perhaps an artificial covering, a sort of whole-eye contact lens.If the latter, why? Something to enhance sight? To protect the eye? To hidesomething?I failed to notice the presence or absence of normal breathing in any of thecreatures I encountered; but the helmet might have been related to the stiflingatmosphere inside the first craft—unless my perception of that air as hot andhumid was a physiological reaction of my own, rather than an actual condition.But if it was a subjective perception on my part, why did the air seem so goodand pure immediately on leaving the craft?Maybe the air was not “hot and humid” as in earth’s atmosphere, but an alienatmosphere of different gas compounds that caused a physiological response thatmade me feel hot and sweaty. This also might have been the source of my muscularweakness, to some extent, though I recovered somewhat as time passed. Perhapsheavier or lighter gravity was in some way a factor.Dr. Robert J. Hudek of Toronto, Canada, an APRO consultant on biologicalsciences, advanced some speculations on the apparent structure of the aliens,commenting specifically on the significance of the aliens’ apparent “humanfetal” resemblance.Dr. Hudek noted consistencies in their structure with ours in terms of currentunderstanding of human anthropology and anatomy. If humanoid creatures have suchextreme similarity to mankind that they exhibit common basic form, it isstrongly indicative of very similar environmental origins. In otherwords—separate but parallel evolution! The extent of resemblance is nothingshort of phenomenal even in the case of the more alien entities. If thehuman-looking creatures did not originate here on earth, their similarity tohuman form is mind-boggling and sobering in its implications.The significance of the human fetal appearance of the aliens lies in the presentapparent course of man’s own evolutionary development. The longer man has beenin possession of an intelligent brain, the more time he has had to influence hisdevelopment by controlling his environment. By this elimination of hostileconditions, he atrophies in his ability to deal with those conditions. Hebecomes less rugged and coarse in his structure. Lack at exposure to cold andthe elements eliminates the need for a hairy body covering or largermusculature. Only his brain need increase in size.An infant human is the most helpless of creatures. Man’s initial helplessness asan infant is proportionately the longest period of infancy of any animal. Yet,when grown, his brain makes him the most formidable animal Early fetal stages ofapes and man exhibit great similarity. But the rugged qualities developed in theape reduce the need for intelligence; the developing brain of the human makesthe rugged qualities of the ape less necessary to survival.Thus, the further man advances in his brain structure, the less his bodilystructure develops from the more fetal, or physically helpless, stage. Dr.Hudek’s theory sounds very logical, if you believe man is evolving, which issometimes a highly debatable issue in itself. The ideas expressed Dr. Hudek arein agreement with “accepted” or relatively undisputed modern scientific thought.Whether they are valid in terms of accepted religious beliefs is another matter.The director of APRO noted that the structure of the aliens, particularly theirfaces, might indicate origins on a planet with high atmospheric density. Soundwould travel well; hence small ears. Oxygen density would require less chestvolume, and give rise to the small nostrils. The dense atmosphere would limitsolar light penetration, requiring the oversized eyes.The horror I experienced in witnessing those aliens is a curious thing. The fearwas not really caused by any appearance of threat. They were smaller than I,carried no weapons, showed no claws or fangs. Perhaps it was simply theirstrangeness which caused my reaction. But then why don’t or we as humans,experience fear and revulsion at the first visual encounter with odd earthanimals?I am beginning to believe this anomaly is due to mankind’s “monster fixation.”The very similarity to man is the key to horror. The popular monsters in themovies are all based on an underlying man-form. This is not simply a lowspecial-effects budget, “man in a suit” problem. The fear factor lies in themonster’s deviation from the human. The link to human form is important becauseif the similarity is reduced too much, other fear factors, such as giganticsize, are needed to enhance the effect of terror. This effects is evident inmost of man’s imagined “man-beast” monsters of the old legends and myths handeddown through the centuries in various cultural heritages.The near identical appearance of the three alien beings, and the odd “familyresemblance” of the four human-type individuals, led to speculation about thembeing robots, their similarity an artifact of assembly-line mass production.Did they “look like” robots? It seems to me that any technology advanced enoughto create a robot that could function as an organic being would also besufficiently advanced to create one with no visible mechanical distinctions. Sothere’s no way I could have been able to tell if they were indeed machinesrather than organic creatures. Both entities moved with a natural fluidity, armsin time with legs. Any movements less natural would have been immediatelyapparent. The small beings were expressionless, but their faces weren’t frozen.I didn’t register specific facial movement, but the organic impression must havebeen communicated to me as such minute functions as subtle flaring of thenostrils or narrowing of the eyes.Many find amazing the presence of the “alien” creatures and the human-lookingones together. Some people’s idea of flying-saucer occupants does not leave roomfor nonhuman types; perhaps they are simply repelled by the idea of theexistence of alien creatures. So they try to explain them away by saying theywere really robots. For others, human-looking individuals do not fit theirparticular preconception. So the robot theory was offered to explain thepresence of one type or the other. If one type were robots, why were the robotsand their makers of differing forms? This could be explained by alien creaturesusing human robots in order to relate to me better, or the human-type entitiesusing alien robots in order to confuse our efforts to know more about them.Robot theory aside, some have suggested only one type of being was there! Theysay maybe the aliens left and returned in a more human form in order to calm me.That would be a remarkable disguise! Over a one-foot difference in height andalmost a hundred pounds in weight! They would have had to have an almost magicalability to transform themselves.Another reason offered for their carbon-copy look was that one or the other typewere clones. Cloning is a process where a single cell taken from an adult animalis grown into an identical twin (only younger) of the original cell-donatinganimal. Hundreds of duplicates of one animal can be generated this way. One raceof beings could have produced clones of another race to act as slaves to fulfillfunctions their own form is less able to, or even incapable of.The aliens could have appeared to me to resemble each other more closely thanthey actually did, due to their strangeness. The aliens might have possesseddifferences that are quite apparent to them, but too subtle for me to havenoticed. These even could have included gender differences, which I did notdiscern. The human type, being more similar to my kind, seemed somewhat lessthan identical, though evincing that strong “family resemblance.” This couldhave been due to the group of characteristics that differentiated them from myhuman race. It could also have been an actual family resemblance. (Speaking ofresemblance, just for fun, compare the countenance of the human-looking male inMike’s rendering [see illustrations] with the “Mars face” photo NASA releasedyears after Mike’s work.)Who was cooperating with whom? I saw nothing to indicate the answer to thatquestion. In fact, I never saw the two types together in one place at the sametime. Nothing indicated one type was a bred-up slave of the other. Nothingpositively indicated friendly cooperation, either. Some people are of the strongopinion that the human-type individuals captured the alien craft for breakingsome interplanetary law in kidnapping me. They believe the human types act asguardians for this planet.The aliens and the human-looking creatures might have cooperated in myabduction—or they might not have. There might or might not exist an interactionand cooperation of all intelligent life forms in space. If there does, whatwould their goals be?Possibly the aliens took me to the human-looking beings (or vice versa) becausethe aliens lacked medical knowledge specific to my physiology. They might haveneeded advice or instruments they were not equipped with, due to the differencebetween my form and theirs—this assuming I was injured by that ray, which isonly conjecture in itself.If I was not injured, what were they doing with me? What was that device acrossmy chest? Was it an instrument of treatment for my chest? The crewmen did saythe beam struck me mostly in the head and chest. Maybe it was some sort of X-rayviewer or fluoroscope. If so, were they looking inside my chest cavity forinjury? Perhaps I was not hurt at all and it was part of an examination.I underwent comprehensive chest X rays from APRO physicians immediately after myreturn. The X rays showed only normal, uninjured structures. And the X raysshowed what appeared to be a tiny calcified granuloma in my upper left lung. Dr.Kandell told me that a granuloma is a deposit of minerals caused by an injury orinfection of the lung tissue. Such deposits can be temporary and normally occurin greater incidence in all people as they grow older. If repairs were made onmy body during those five days, they apparently didn’t make everything soperfect as to remove that fleck.There was one speculation that I might have had a transmitter planted somewherein my body! That I had been tagged for later retrieval, or become anindetectable, mobile spy device for the aliens. Unpleasant concepts.Theoretically every sensory input to my brain—sight, sound, touch, smell, andtaste—would be automatically transferred to an alien craft high above the earth.Ha! Speculation can reach extremes at times. APRO scientists asked forpermission to X-ray my head. I refused because I don’t believe there is anythingthere but my brain, and radiation is harmful to living tissue. The brain is themost essential part of the body, so I didn’t find sufficient justification inspeculation to risk my health.Some of the following speculations may seem more like concepts best discussed inthe chapter 11. But since “the demon question,” like the “electrically induceddelusion” theory, weren’t major elements in the archskeptic’s attacks, andbecause they are so speculative, I have placed them here.Were these creatures Satan’s minions or chariot drivers of the gods? As I’vestated elsewhere, this is not necessarily a religious matter—no more than thequestion of simple life existing on Mars is a religious matter. However, maybeit’s natural this is so often suggested. After all, don’t both religion andufology deal with central questions about the universe, who we are, and ourplace in that universe? In fairness to all religions, the supreme being orbeings are, by definition, over and above all that there is. The UFO phenomenonis just a part of all that there is. So, no contradiction of any religion isnecessarily implied. I know of no religion with scripture specifically statingthat humankind are the only sentient creatures in the universe.Did the first type of alien act like demons, the other like angels? I did notsee anything whatsoever that would fit my understanding of anything remotelylinking this concept with what I experienced. Others may disagree, if they wishto disregard my impressions here, thinking I’ve been duped or was insufficientlyattuned. Who wouldn’t prefer to believe they had spent time in the hands ofangels? But I don’t see evidence to justify such a conclusion.Could the UFO incident at Turkey Springs be an effect of the UFO fanaticism of“true believers”? This is strange logic. Unless they’re claiming that this couldgenerate a mass hallucination, they’re implying that when a person believessomething so very intensely, that when it satisfies all the needs that religionwould satisfy for that person, they are then most likely to falsify the verything they worship. Ridiculous. This is like saying that those who most believein the Second Coming are most likely to simulate it with an antichrist. In otherwords they’re saying that the most religious commit the greatest sacrilege.Another theory more incomprehensible than what it purports to explain, to saynothing of the fact that no one involved in the incident felt this way about thesubject of UFOs. However, it does suggest the possibility that some of those whoare attacking with such frenzy are doing so because they see religion, UFOs,etc., as manifestations of what they believe to be the same human shortcomings.The variety of spacecraft I saw generates unanswered questions. Which type ofcraft belonged to which type of being? Why do the craft vary in appearance ifthey are designed for the same function? How are they made? What powers them?When I awoke in the first craft I was in the presence of the aliens. Did thefirst craft belong to the aliens? Or was it owned by the human type, with thealiens present in the craft only for the purpose of their activities with me?Was there a forceful capture of the first craft by the human-type people beforethe “man” came in?Was the planetarium-like view of the stars an elaborate three-dimensional starmap, or an actual view of the surrounding stars? If it was an actual, outsideview, had the craft been brought into the large hangar structure while I wasbeing led down the hallway and kept waiting in the airlock-like room? Or was thestar view visible inside the first craft in spite of the surrounding, largerstructure?What happened when I pushed those buttons in that room? Was the motion of thestars the turning of a star map or of the entire craft? I did not feel motionwhen the stars moved. In fact, I did not feel motion of the craft at any timeduring my experience. (Neither did I become aware of any definite backgroundnoise.) However, it has been theorized that flying-saucer occupants haveovercome the effects of inertia. This would allow them to accelerateinstantaneously without being crushed from the g force. If the craft wassomewhere outside, far away from the hangar structure, when I pushed thosebuttons, then possibly my unskilled button-punching could have caused the craftautomatically to return to a home base.Those controls might not have been pilot controls; someone else may have beensteering the ship from another area. And even if those buttons were controls, anoverride system elsewhere in the craft or even at a main base may havefunctioned. If the craft did not enter the hangar structure at that point, howdid the “man” get there? Maybe he was there all the time.What was the purpose of the green screen on the chair? What was the significanceof the black lines and their relative motions? Why were there no numbers orother denotations accompanying them? Perhaps the lines were some sort ofcalculation concerning operation or powering of the ship itself. Maybe they werenavigational computations. Rather than lines lacking numbers or words, theymight have even been the aliens’ way of expressing numbers or words.The lever on the arm of the chair was on the left, which may be a clue as to the“handedness” of their species, unless they don’t possess this neurologicalfeature. The buttons on the right would still require some dexterity. Perhapsthey are ambidextrous.The craft we saw in the woods was only about twenty feet in diameter, while thefirst craft in which I awoke appeared to be sixty feet in diameter, when I leftit. It is doubtful that seven witnesses could have so badly estimated the size.They must have been two different crafts of identical configuration. (Unlessthey can shrink living beings!) The humanlike creature who took me out of therecould have been the pilot of the smaller first craft, which he could have flownfrom the ground to a rendezvous with the second craft in space. The first craftwas of a size that would fit within the lower part of the larger one.Why the simplicity of the internal features of that second craft? Was it newlymade, as yet unfinished? Or were the makers simply extremely practical andundecorative by nature? One person speculated that the strength of the materialof the ship was unimportant as long as there was a continuous connection ofmatter in its construction. This could be because the strength of the substancewould rely on a bonding field of energy that holds it together indestructibly.The continuity of the structure would be necessary for the bonding field to actupon the matter. This idea would explain the lack of visible seams, welds,bolts, or rivets in that craft. For whatever purpose, the craft might have beeneither machined from (or cast as) a huge single piece of metal, or made from aprocess involving both casting and machining. What gigantic molds and lathesthat would require!I have heard and learned a few things about UFOs since my experience. There isan odd consistency that runs through nearly all descriptions of UFOs: most arecircular in at least one geometrical dimension. A disc, a sphere, and a cylinderall are round or circular in at least one view. Is this one of the factors towhich their construction is limited, or can they design them in any shape(aesthetically preferring the round) that pleases them?Why, in all the consistency of flying-disc descriptions, is there so muchvariety of the finer particulars? They are as alike and also as different fromeach other as snowflakes. Could the circular factor be necessitated bylimitations imposed by their power sources and functions? But then, why thevariety? Can it be accounted for entirely by witnesses’ discrepancy from fact?It is quite common for a dozen people witnessing a traffic accident each toreport a different version of the incident. Maybe everyone is really seeingbasically the same thing, only reporting it differently. But I saw two designsmyself; and there seems to be far too much variety in the descriptions to defendthe notion of a single design.Maybe the differences are simply a matter of style, as is the case with ourautomobiles. Russian spacecraft appear different from ours, but the function isthe same. Maybe the differences in shape are due to differences in function, aswith a motorcycle, a luxury car, and a dump truck.The craft in which I regained consciousness was angular, of a dull finish, andsat flat on the surface it was parked upon. The other craft in that larger roomwere rounded, highly reflective, and seemed to balance on their rounded bottoms.They could have had some sort of magnetic or gyroscopic mechanism holding themup. Or they might have been heavier on the bottom, thereby enabled to balance.They might also have been mechanically supported by attachment to the floor orthe wall. Such attachment also could have been the means of entry to the craft,since no hatches were visible. Or the surface might only have appeared unbroken,the edges of a doorway unnoticeable when closed.What was that hangarlike room in which I saw those crafts? Where was it? Was itpart of a craft, shaped like a giant cigar, such as sometimes is reported in UFOsightings?That large hangarlike structure also could have been a building on a planetsomewhere! Perhaps here on earth as part of a base, or on one of the planets ofour own solar system? Maybe on a planet that no man of earth has ever seen. Tolook out at the stars at night and think: Which one? If I was taken to a placeoutside the earth, which one of those stars could have a planet revolving aroundit that I might have actually been taken to?I actually cannot gain the slightest idea where I was taken to. I have used theterms “human-type” and “human-looking” in referring to one class of beings Iencountered. I have variously called the other group beings, creatures,entities, aliens, and humanoids. Actually both types would be properly describedas humanoid, having the basic form of a man in terms of arrangement of arms,legs, and facial features. But by “alien” I didn’t necessarily mean“extraterrestrial.” Nothing positively indicated those crafts or their occupantscame from outer space. A number of other theories have been advanced as to theirorigin. Dr. J. Allen Hynek advanced a hypothesis of an otherdimensional origin.Some people believe that these objects come to us through time! Visitorsarriving from the past or future? Perhaps—if time travel is physically possible.There are also a variety of theories to explain these crafts as of earthlyorigin. One variation has it that some present earth government, most likely ourown, is responsible. This theory has our “black budget” scientists makingextraordinary advances far beyond what is generally known, or perhapssuccessfully deciphering the technology of a crashed craft. In this scenario thecrash of an extraterrestrial visitor would be an extremely rare event, perhaps asingularity, with most modern sightings actually being our own earthlycreations. In keeping with this premise, all or most “alien” encounters are withrobots, actors in special-effects makeup, or the result of hypnotic manipulationby the ordinary humans actually responsible.This idea has great appeal to many for manifold reasons. Some people view aliensas an impossibility within their own religious cosmology. Some merely don’t feelat ease believing in such “monsters.” Many view modern science as so completethat current pronouncements on the limitations of speed and distance, as weunderstand them, they regard as inviolable. There are conspiracy buffs, who likethe idea of vast secrecies in matters cosmic as well as mundane. And there maybe some who know something we don’t.A few things in my experience lead me to be interested in this theory, too. Iadmit I would find such an explanation easier to cope with than the alternative.The presence of those human-looking individuals strikes me as out of sync withpurely extraterrestrial activity. The odds against such a coincidence ofappearance makes me suspicious. Certain things have happened since then tosuggest powerful human influence behind the scenes.Why are the human-looking beings conspicuously absent from my nightmares andflashbacks about the incident? Perhaps my entire conscious memory of whathappened during the five days is an implanted memory and not what happened atall. A subsequent event involving military intelligence, which I’ll not describeyet, also fits such a scenario.This is all conjecture, but we can further speculate that perhaps one reasonthat the Pentagon’s internal newspaper, Pentagram, gave Fire in the Sky afour-star review and called it a “must-see” is because they have amore-than-passing interest in it. Maybe my whole experience is an enormousinside joke to certain people there. I don’t know, maybe I'm reaching a bithere. But, it’s something I speculate about.On a recent episode of Dr. Dean Edell’s syndicated TV show I saw a magiciandemonstrate how some con men simulate psychic surgery. Rolling up his sleeves,he displayed his empty hands. After miraculously producing a bloody “tumor’extracted from his volunteer “patient,” he revealed how it was done. He’d hadthe blood and tumor (chicken viscera) hidden inside a false fifth finger. I’dconsidered myself pretty observant, but I’d not noticed the extra digit insertedin between his other fingers when he had displayed his “empty” hands so openlyat the start. I shouldn’t feel so taken in—no one in the studio audience hadnoticed, either, and they were up close and live. The lesson I see in thatlittle demonstration is that we need to scrutinize more than just those parts ofour memories which seem hazy or uncertain. Sometimes feeling certain is not adependable indicator of the reliability of our beliefs.Another variation of the earth-origin theory is that the alien pilots are thereturning explorers of an ancient technological civilization now extinct. Stillanother refers to the fact that frequency of modern-day sightings rosedramatically with the end of World War II. This is supposed to suggest that thesecretly surviving remnants of a group of Nazi mad scientists have slowlyrebuilt their might for the day when their hordes will swoop upon us for thefinal coup—with Hitler himself in command, no doubt. Good grief!In the various earth-origin theories of UFOs, their bases are built at thebottom of the oceans, underground, inside a “hollow earth,” or on the moon andother planets in this solar system. Gould that hangarlike structure actuallyhave been in one of these places?Almost the first instrument-checking anyone thought of doing was radiationtesting. The radiation check made out at Turkey Springs was actually of limiteduse because it was so belated and incomplete. The prior presence of a strongradiation source might not necessarily result in higher radioactivity of thesurroundings once that source is no longer present, unless some quantity of“hot” matter is left behind. The readings on the crewmen’s hard hats worn duringthe sighting remain unexplained. The question is open either way as to whetherradiation was present at the site. On the other hand, the electromagneticreadings recorded by Bill Spaulding may—surprisingly—have some validity, sincethe actual measurements may have been taken by associates of his that may havegreater reliability.The question is, however, why radiation? There seems to be a general, immediateassumption of a nuclear power source for these craft. This might not necessarilybe true. Just because nuclear power is our own newest developed source of energydoes not mean an advanced technology has not discovered something superior. Thepresence of radiation at some UFO sightings may mean that at least some of thesecraft have a nuclear power source. Or it could mean that other functions of thecraft are atomically fueled, while the main drive depends on an unknown energysource.It has been suggested that if these craft require atomic energy in some form,that fact might explain their presence at Turkey Springs. The Mogollon Rim is abig crack in the earth exposing many layers of geological strata. Uranium hasbeen discovered in numerous places on the Colorado Plateau, of which the Rim isa part. The aliens may have been secretly engaged in prospecting or mining ofradioactive minerals. But then again, their presence on the Rim may reflectmerely the characteristic preference of UFOs for activity in remote areas.Exactly what is their power source? If we could discover it, we too would gainthe freedom they might possess to traverse the universe!While our speculations are running so far afield, consider the interestingobservation Mike made during a return to the site we made in 1993. He noticedthat the trees nearest where the craft had hovered seemed to have grown far morethan would have been natural in the intervening seventeen years. Intrigued, Mikewent there again after the snow melted to investigate further. His long forestcareer made him aware that the thinning process alone can induce acceleratedgrowth. But these trees are in the clearing, so no competing trees had beenremoved from near them. He also noted that, since they grow near the crest ofthe ridge, their enhanced growth couldn’t have been caused by increased rainrunoff from a thinned area up-hill from them. So he cut down one of the trees inquestion, selecting one which would have qualified for removal under normal TSIspecifications. Examining the pattern of growth rings in the resulting stump,Mike was amazed. Carefully counting back seventeen annual layers, he found thatafter 1975 the thickness of growth abruptly jumped to four or five times that ofany of the tree’s previous years!At the time the craft neared it, the tree, though small, had been fifty-sevenyears old, but had more than doubled in diameter and nearly tripled in height bythe time it was cut. Using the formula (v = n X r2 X h % 3) that gives you thevolume of a cone (a trunk tapers—it’s actually a tall cone rather than acylinder), Mike calculated an average yearly total increase in wood mass morethan thirty-six times the average for the fifty-seven rings formed prior to1975. Other trees, located in similar conditions but farther from where thecraft descended, showed no phenomenal growth change.Mike wondered if there might be another explanation. He considered consulting aforestry expert to confirm his observation and calculations. Where could anyonebe found who was sufficiently objective, and willing to take the consequences ofpassing official judgment on such a question? Obviously, pursuing it would befutile. However, the stump and other trees are still there.With all the upset and hassle and other life-changing experiences I have gonethrough since November 5, 1975, I have paused to ponder in retrospect the wisdomof my decision to approach that UFO. Those first fateful steps began it all. Theone last question the interviewers nearly always ask is: “If you had it all todo over again, would you be so eager to run up close to one of those craft?”Hindsight is useless. What is done is done. I cannot change it. I have had somepretty rough experiences as a result of that choice, but I have also benefitedfrom the lessons I have learned.“Well,” they persist, “if the exact same circumstances were to presentthemselves again, would you approach the craft?”In the past, I’ve been undecided and given varying replies to this question.However, in my present frame of mind, the answer is a flat no! I took a veryfoolish chance in approaching something so completely unknown. I could have beenkilled, but I lived to deeply regret it.“Well, you seem to be fine now. Do you think they had bad intentions?” they ask.I perceived the entire experience as infinitely terrifying and threatening whileit was happening. Yet in hindsight I must say that their intentions seemed atworst neutral, if not exactly benevolent. I was returned safely, when they didnot have to return me at all. When I was returned, I was put down close to town,and not left lying in the middle of the road. I was returned when there was notraffic on the road (so I could not flag down a passing motorist for help), butthat was probably due to their efforts at concealment. They probably could seefrom very high up that no headlights were coming from either direction on thehighway. My head was placed on my arm with my face turned away from the craft.This could have been a protective measure for me, or they might not have wantedme to see them leave, for some reason. The placing of my body might also havebeen mere chance.Although I was psychologically traumatized, I have no conscious memory of beingharmed or treated cruelly during my experience. The shock of suddenly seeingsuch creatures, coupled with my pain, the suffocating sensations, and theperception of being trapped, combined to create an extremely negative reaction.I have no better reason to ascribe to them bad intentions.However, the absence of evident bad intentions does not necessarily mean theyhad good intentions. There was a certain degree of high-handedness in theirtaking me in the first place. I did not exactly ask to go. They may have beenmerely presenting a harmless image. They may actually have sinister intentionsin regard to Planet Earth. I am not saying that they are definitely bad; it isonly a possibility. But a possibility is all there needs to be, in order toadvise caution. I would strongly recommend against anyone approaching an alienspacecraft at this stage in knowledge of ufology. Since, without more data,almost anything is possible, they could intend anything—even war or cannibalism!Many people are predicting greater activity of UFOs in the near future. Thetrend of increasing reported incidents supports this prediction. I believe thatserious large-scale research effort on UFOs is urgently needed. Whether theirintentions are good, bad or indifferent, we should not be caught unprepared.Let’s take our eyes off the ground and prepare for whatever the future brings.Who knows?—it may also prove greatly rewarding.Until the publication of my first book, I avoided mentioning something that cameout under the hypnosis performed by Dr. James Harder. The reason for my silencewas fear. I delayed revealing it while I wrestled with the relative values anddangers involved.This information came out while I was under a particularly deep segment of thehypnoregressive series. I retained no memory afterward of what happened duringthat session, and my brother Duane delayed telling me of it because of thepotential emotional impact. Later, when I could handle it better, he told me,for my own safety. With the knowledge came his advice to refuse any furtherhypnotic regression.After Dr. Harder first caused me to relive in greater detail the two hours Iconsciously remembered, he probed deeper, trying to discover if I hadexperienced more during the five days than I had recalled.Duane told me that after a difficult series of psychological maneuvers, Dr.Harder arrived at a mental block in me, enforced by a subconscious warning—orthreat—that I would die if regression continued any deeper! I had wondered whythose witnessing the session looked at me so oddly after I was brought out ofthe trance.Dr. Harder could not precisely determine whether the block is an actual warning,meaning that I would really die, or only a false threat designed to discourageefforts at uncovering blocked memories. Dr. Harder also considered it possiblethe mental block was the result of my own deep subconscious fears, and notactually the result of an implanted posthypnotic suggestion. So I learned thatit was possible that more to my experience existed than I could then recall.That knowledge weighed upon me in the aftermath of November 5, 1975, perhapsmore than any other aspect of the entire experience. The infinite variety ofpossibilities of what could have happened in those five days really worried me.What if my entire conscious memory was a false implant? Could my nightmaresactually contain fragments of surfacing memories? I had had enough struggles inadjusting to the short span I could already consciously recall. I worried whatsort of deeply emotional or frightening experiences I would be forced to copewith if I were to suddenly recall everything.Dr. Harder did not even attempt to continue to probe the nature of the block,let alone try to penetrate it. Dr. Harder and other APRO officials were mostconsiderate of my welfare in this regard. After I learned of it, I asked themnot to publicize it, as I felt I would be in danger if it were to become known.Some of them felt I might be overestimating the danger, but nonetheless agreedto confidentiality.The danger of people knowing about that part of the hypnosis lay in some men’sinsatiable greed and lust for power. What greater physical power can there be inthe universe than the power of interstellar flight? If such men were to believethat I might have hidden knowledge of propulsion or weaponry developed by asuperior technology, they might well stop at nothing to get at it—even if Ishould die in the attempt.Why then did I finally reveal the fact? It seemed unlikely that suchintelligences would ever allow that sort of knowledge to fall into our hands; sothey would not have allowed me to learn it in the first place. Even if I hadbeen exposed to the workings of their greatest technological achievements, whatwould I have gained? If I could lift the hood of my automobile and show theengine to a caveman, could he possibly go home and build one?But the greatest reason for revealing the deep-trance discovery was the safetydoing so automatically brought. There are always a few who learn of the mostcarefully kept secrets. A state of semisecrecy would have allowed theunscrupulous a freer rein to engage in covert activities. If everyone knowsabout it, it is that much more difficult for an illegal act against me to gounnoticed.I took steps to ensure my personal safety, but maybe it wasn’t really necessary.No one can be hypnotized against his will. I could not even be hypnotized byanyone I did not trust.I once thought that someday I might get up enough nerve to try hypnosis again. Ithought I would initially deal only with the nature of the block; to determinethe extent of the danger without going too far. That missing time bothered me,because, as Leonard Nimoy said in reference to my experience: “. . . theimplications are enormous.” Regression seemed the only way to get rid of thatfeeling. I considered self-hypnosis. But after all these years I have never feltsufficiently moved to go under again. In any event, from the lessons learned inthe aftermath of my experience, I think if I actually did uncover previouslyblocked memories, either by self-hypnosis or spontaneously, it would probably bebest never to reveal them publicly.“Are you afraid they will come back to get you?” Yes and no. I’m not possessedof any mind-consuming phobia that it might happen again. But for a while, when Istood out on my porch on a quiet evening, gazing up at the stars, I would feel alittle uneasy and cast an apprehensive glance or two into the shadows.What I dreaded more than anything was seeing those awful, huge, staring eyes setin those bulging pale-skinned domes. A verbal description or a drawing justcannot duplicate what you would feel if you actually saw one of them. No amountof rationalizing my fear, in realizing its source or telling myself there is noobjective reason for it, can neutralize that terror. If you think: “What’s soscary about that?” I can only say, just wait until you meet one face-to-face.I don’t mean to give cause for alarm. If anyone is extremely worried about it Icould offer advice, tongue in cheek, to carry a camera—that should keep themaway. To all appearances, there is little or no danger. It’s just that I don’twant to be responsible for the consequences if I reassure everyone ofharmlessness, and I turn out to be wrong.Just that one word of caution. However, don’t let these doubts overly affectyour attitude. Be ready to greet people of other worlds with friendliness, ifthey ever make open contact with us. They could have much to offer. In themeantime, we need to support better research to find out exactly what we shoulddo to get ready. Should we try to have a stronger defense—or a warmer handshake?Who knows.Who knows any of the answers to the questions discussed in this chapter. I haveprobably raised more questions than I have answered with these speculations.Don’t forget that they are merely speculations—pure conjecture.Right now we don’t have any solid answers.

After such an intense period of nonstop assault on thesensibilities, can life ever be as it was before?At first, I was in perpetual doubt as to whether or not I was even going to getthrough it. I lived each day, each hour, from minute to minute. It was burdenenough to cope with that by itself, without looking beyond.One sunny fall day I was a young, single, devil-may-care guy full of plans,relishing the prospect of tomorrow. The next thing I knew, everything was indoubt: my future, prior relationships, people I’d thought I could count on,institutions I’d taken for granted, my place in society, and, right at thebeginning, even the reality of my own perceptions.Day and night I was wired tight. Adrenaline surged constantly. The images ofthose recent traumatic events were constantly in my mind’s eye, waking andsleeping. When I could sleep, vivid but chaotic dreams woke me nightly. I had atremendous amount of inner processing, sorting, confronting, accepting, andadjusting to do. To do that, one needs enough time and peace, enough space andsleep.And I wasn’t getting it. The spectrum of reactions to what happened—good, bad,or indifferent—kept me constantly off balance. There was a constant torrent ofthings to deal with. I had so much coming at me so fast, that coping with thisoverwhelming cacophony took everything I had. It seemed as if almost everyonewanted a piece of me—sometimes literally.I was afraid of what I couldn’t remember. And I was afraid it would happenagain. Or maybe government agents would come and take me and subject me tomental, maybe even physical, dissection. What if I came down with some bizarreinfection unknown to human medical science? What if I began suffering weirdeffects from breathing that strange atmosphere? What if I started exhibitingsymptoms of severe radiation damage? What if I just couldn’t cope with all ofthis?I can laugh at such fears now. But at the time, that natural faith we carry,that the familiar and conventional will naturally be there the next time welook, had for me been severely shaken. Fortunately, years of thinking and livingin a more normal world have restored that confidence to me.Adding to the pressures on me was my strategy of trying to present the outwardappearance of being in control. Going on as if nothing was wrong did have asteadying effect, but it also led many people who might have been more helpfulto assume I was already on my way to recovery.In spite of the fact that it all seemed to be nearly too much for me, I went italone. I navigated that whole period without professional help or counseling ofany kind. Why? Partly because my family are a pretty self-reliant bunch. Partlybecause I didn’t believe there was anyone in the counseling or psychiatric fieldwho had anything in the standard framework of their training or experience thatwould remotely equip them to handle something so extraordinary. An exampleillustrating this was Dr. Jean Rosenbaum’s conclusions. He was more disposed toperceive the matter as fitting into a standard category with which he wasfamiliar, than to try to apply his experience and knowledge to something outsidehis paradigm. There was nowhere to turn. So, internally, I was on my own.However, I can’t say there was no help at all around me. My family stood by me.And so did some of my friends, but most of all there was my sweet Dana. Shedidn’t have any answers to the profound questions, she didn’t have any specialpsychological insight. I’m sure she often felt at a loss to know what to say anddo. Perhaps at times she even felt pushed into the background by the incident,from the way some people approached us. But she was there for me, with herloving understanding, centeredness, and warm support. Her grandmother’s simple,earthy, caring, small-town ways had their echo in her. So she became my anchor,my one rock in that sea of chaos.I went back to church for a while. But rather than finding spiritual answersthere, I encountered a microcosm of my situation within the wider community. Soagain I was on my own. As vast and mysterious as the cosmos is, ultimatereligious truth lies far above any of this—or the world in which it happened. Iam not saying the event lies outside of religious considerations, but that it’sjust one more element within the grand scheme of things. That which encompassesand supersedes everything, must naturally do so to truly everything. People toooften make exclusively religious interpretations of things of this nature. Isuppose this has a lot to do with their previous orientation to life in general.I did a lot of very deep searching in the religious area, but my earlier outlookhad emphasized more of a scientific or philosophical approach. So that’s thekind of sense I tried to make of this experience to a great extent.Popular wisdom has it that denial is not a good coping strategy; but as atemporary measure it worked for me. I pushed the experience and its aftermathinto the background. I boxed it up, put it aside and went on with my life. Astime went on, I pulled things out of that box one at a time, dealing with themat my own pace. Eventually I worked up to returning to work in the woods. Ispent a lot of time alone, laboring under the sun with ax or chainsaw in hand.The work itself didn’t demand a lot of concentration, so my mind was free toponder and reflect, accept and adjust.There were no stages or definite turning points for me, except the initialhypnosis session. My recovery was a long, gradual process—so evenly evolving andnatural that I realize it most resembles the changes which come with life,simply living, the personal growth of maturity. And like that sort of growth, itcontinues to this day.In my earlier account I tried to pass off, to minimize the negative reaction Iwas experiencing; I was still in the middle of it and I hoped to avoid makingworse what was already bad enough. During the peak of the feeding frenzy, thepress had gone for the kill. Once the tone was set it became a free-for-all.It’s a familiar aspect of human nature that such a pattern determines the fateof certain unfortunates in school and work situations. I didn’t want to createan atmosphere in which the dimmer minds among those around me would be incitedto such a mob mentality.One of the strategies I use most to get a handle on complex matters is to stepoutside myself and the situation mentally, then try to take an objectiveoverview. When I do this concerning everything involving the UFO incident, Icontinually think I have arrived, that I can finally see it for itself withoutdistortion by personal referents. I do this only to find I need to step backagain. And again. Each time seeing more, realizing a wider perspective, but eachtime coming to sense the existence of a larger frame of reference.It’s like the reverse of one of those pictures on the wall, which is a pictureof the whole scene including the picture on the wall. . . and so on. If we lookfirst at one in the series, we ask, when can we finally see the whole? This islike the converse of widened perspective—deepened introspection. I, however, ofcourse believe this apparent paradox arises from the nature of consciousness andgrowth, rather than anything unique to the incident of 1975.I was adjusting to more than the experience itself. I was adjusting to people’sreactions to the incident and their altered perceptions of me—everybody’s—or soit seemed from what the world news media presented. It’s no exaggeration to saythat the human reaction gave me as much to cope with as the incident itself.Which is saying a good deal more than most people realize.There were ironic parallels between the incident and its aftermath. In both Ifelt powerless to control my destiny, to affect my condition. In both I feltvictimized. In both I felt inspected, on display, like a bug in a jar. Icouldn’t go anywhere without the stares, the pointing, the smirks, and thewhispers. I often felt singled out, made to feel like some kind of sideshowfreak. Expectation of seeing something bizarre was so strong I would hear ofpeople who didn’t know me reinterpreting some perfectly normal behavior of mine.People would walk up and talk to me, and as they talked, seemed to be lookingfor something, scanning for who knows what. They seemed to study me with adistracted air, as if thinking of something other than the conversation.If they expected to find a pair of antennae sprouting from my head or perhapssome odd green patches showing through on my skin, they were disappointed. I’mnot sure what artifact or thrill was anticipated, but they didn’t seemsatisfied.People see what they want to see. Introducing anyone to an average group primedwith stories arbitrarily attributing various characteristics to the newcomer iscertain to result in that person being perceived as amply confirming thosepreconceptions. Regardless of their actual behavior or traits, the tendencywould be for them to be seen as hostile, friendly, nerdy, cool, dumb, smart, orwhatever was earlier described.I was aware that it was only human nature, but that didn’t make me like it anybetter. So, for someone used to living by his own concepts and standards, it wasespecially demeaning to be put in the ironic position of having to make sure myevery public act was more normal than “normal.”Although people were serious in inquiring whether my experience had left me withany impairments or enhanced abilities, in that environment it was very importantto do nothing to confirm notions of being anything but straight down the middleof the road, bland, neutral, boring, normal. Anything less might get me carriedoff by a torch-carrying mob wielding pitch-forks, to be stoned, dissected, orburned at the stake. Well, at least metaphorically speaking.My determination to ignore it all and continue on with a normal life wascontinually challenged. Whenever my detachment lulled me into believing for amoment that I could blend back in, someone would walk up and, with what theymust have imagined was marvelous cleverness, ask some sly, insinuating questionI’d heard a dozen times before.Occasionally people would say something like: “Well, I heard that they proved[some baseless charge or typical rumor].” I’d turn and ask, “Just exactly whatdo you personally know about it that you could be sure of? Anything at all you’dfeel safe to call a fact?” Their stammering admissions were all thedemonstration I needed to make my point. Opportunities for repartees were rare,though. Usually I heard about such comments secondhand, after the fact.That’s okay. Those scenes revealed the measure of those people, not me. I won’tsay that thought gave enough consolation to make their attitudes not matter. ButI could take it. What would really enrage me was something like that directed atDana or one of my kids. The kids weren’t even born before the incident. To thisday, a dig at them in that vein will elicit from me a quick and decidedlynon-passive reply.For the most part I became inured to it. I withdrew to a detached existence, alife apart. I suppose you could say I was “alienated.” Later on, I wasn’t soaffected that I couldn’t see the humor in some of the situations arising fromthe Turkey Springs incident. One joke made the rounds: “You hear they provedTravis was telling the truth? When he came back they found a Mars bar in hispocket.” There was also the obvious “Milky Way” variation. School kids chanted asingsong on the playground: “Flying saucers, UFO, where did Travis Walton go?”That was embellished to: “Travis Walton, UFO. Where did all the spaceships go?Travis ate ’em, now he’s back. Now he has to take a spaceship crap! ”Great humor, eh? Actually the big motivator for such reactions, humor included,is fear. People often resort to humor regarding things they fear, especiallywhen it’s something over which they have little control. Witness the topics ofthe standup comic: crime, the boss, death and taxes. For soldiers, the enemy,who might end their life, is a principal butt of jokes.Another dimension to fear is the fear of ridicule. The irony of bigoted thinkingis that the putdowns directed at the out-group are really a nervous attempt at ahollow sort of self-validation. Foment derision to divert it, lest someone makeyou an object of it.Related to that insight, and particularly disappointing, was how some people,who treated us with normal friendliness and respect in private, became cool anddistant (if they didn’t pretend not to see us altogether) when we encounteredthem in public.And there were a couple of matters when I had good reason to believe certainauthorities didn’t act with objectivity because I was involved, even though myrole in the situation was clearly on the side of justice. In one case I stoppeda grown man who was beating a third-grade boy bloody for taunting his childrenon the way home from school. Authorities had the boy’s testimony, his wounds,and my testimony. Imagine my feelings when the investigating officer couldn’tget her superiors to do anything about it—and we all knew why.Then there were those who, in the normal, day-to-day course of humaninteractions, would occasionally perceive themselves at odds with me over someunrelated issue. So, of course, they would immediately bring up the UFO incidentas their ad hominem trump card, behind my back, of course.It would be easy for someone in my position to blame all life’s little setbackson such discrimination. But to do so would be a cop-out, making unjustifiedexcuses for one’s own natural shortcomings, or ordinary bad luck. Under thecircumstances I believe I’ve done well not to fall for using such a perpetuallyready excuse. Although there were times I didn’t get the job when I was the morequalified, you can’t assume. It’s inevitable that not everything will go one’sway.Reactions weren’t all negative; but even positive reactions could presentproblems. I would get calls at odd hours of the night, from people who simplyfelt it monumentally important—they weren’t sure why—to relate to me a sightingthey had made ten years earlier of a strange, moving point of light in the nightsky. Perfect strangers would call in the middle of dinner and expect me to letit get cold while I gave them a detailed account of my experience—apparentlymerely for their private entertainment. A number of calls were more than alittle strange.On the other hand, many individuals called whom I was glad to come to know. Someare good friends still. And to be contacted by old friends with whom I’d lostcontact was yet another small recompense, a lighter thread in the lining of thatdark cloud hovering over my days. My life was not without happiness; someaspects have been richly rewarding.Nevertheless, calls became a big problem. I still felt it was very important toget the truth out, but to try to do so one person at a time would’ve burned meout without ever accomplishing it. I had the phone disconnected, went withoutone for years. My sense of community was reduced further still.Every time Mike Rogers was interviewed, and sometimes when asked about it bypeople he knew, the question was raised: “How could you just drive off and leaveyour best friend to his fate at the mercy of such a threat?” Certain members ofmy family made known their strong feelings about it.Mike was having a big load of guilt dumped on him. Plus, it was obvious he wasbeing hard on himself about it. He became overly sensitive to criticism from meon unrelated matters. He kept saying I was “accusing” him. I think that in hismind he was projecting onto me the reproach he was getting from others. Ipersonally don’t remember ever verbalizing such blame. In fact, I got the strongimpression that he blamed me for many of the troubles that came his way becauseof the incident. “If you weren’t so reckless, if you hadn’t gotten out of thetruck, if you’d come back when everyone yelled at you to, none of this would behappening.”Admittedly there was some truth to that, but I didn’t take kindly to the mannerin which the point was made. Things deteriorated between me and my best friendof many years—my wife’s brother. There was a blowup. We hardly spoke to eachother for a number of years.I don’t know if it was solely to avoid me, but Mike started not showing up forfamily gatherings. Mike’s family has always been much closer to each otheremotionally than mine; they regularly get together for birthdays and holidays.But Mike started to withdraw, to become an emotional hermit. One more majorbrick in my growing wall of isolation—and one for him.In 1977 I wrote my first book, for its therapeutic effect and with an eye towardaccomplishing in a single effort more than I ever could with thousands ofinterviews.For a long time the media kept up a steady stream of inquiries. Curious peoplewould seek me out. Snowflake is a bit off the beaten path, but that didn’t seemto slow them. Day after day, mail from around the world poured in. The phoneonly stopped ringing when I had it taken out.When I finally consented to interviews, I began to feel like a broken record, Irepeated the same words so many times. Most people were understanding of my needto get away from all that, apologizing profusely, thanking me for my time. Butthey still kept coming. “Just one more.”They didn’t seem to realize that for me, retelling it was like reliving it. Nomatter how many times I went through the memory, it never failed to knot my gut,cause me to break into a cold sweat. I would feel wrung-out afterward. I felt itimportant that the world be made aware of some things. But I often wondered ifit was worth the price.I wasn’t very sophisticated about the media. Before November 1975 I didn’t knowthe meaning of “tabloid,” “ambush interview,” “green room,” or “trial by media.”My naiveté destined me for some exploitation and a few hatchet jobs. I learnedabout “ventriloqual attacks,” where, to preserve the illusion of neutrality,journalists in a face-to-face interview express their own accusations as comingfrom a vague “they.”A few media pros, like Richard Robertson or Sam Lowe of the Phoenix Gazette ormany others I should name, had the integrity even when they took a skepticalstance to present the facts as fairly and objectively as they could.Then there were other persons who hit the lows of journalistic ethics. Thosewho, in the name of “balance,” merely listed some of my critics’ charges,without printing the solid refutation of which they were perfectly aware.That was mild compared to some behavior of media people I could name. People whomade false promises just to get cooperation. People who looked me straight inthe eye and promised there would be no slant, no last-minute intercutting of“sniper” viewpoints, in their interviews. People who would include surpriseguests to attack me. People who would pretend to be completely sympathetic andin agreement with my statements, then turn right around and write attacks theyknew to be false because I had shown them the proof. People who use “monsterlighting” and photos taken so close, with a specific lens, there was actually apronounced parabolic “fish-eye” distortion to the pictures, where the nearestfeatures of the face appear to bulge huge, the periphery shrunken. Such photosappeared only in the “hatchet job” articles, so it was no accident.These people managed to transform my naive openness into cynical wariness. Ifsuch laxity wasn’t their habit, perhaps the subject matter made them feel theycould abandon their usual journalistic standards. Perhaps mainstream mediapeople, viewing the topic as one for the tabloids, felt justified in behavinglike tabloid writers. For a time I refused to give interviews. One more additionto my feelings of isolation and estrangement.As I wrote the foregoing passage, an incident occurred to really drive home tome how powerfully people’s predispositions dominate their perceptions. After adiscussion with a visitor to our home about always telling the truth, mychildren were asked to summarize the message and tell why lying is sodestructive. After their remarks, with my usual abstract conceptualizing I addedsomething like, “Yes, you should never speak untrue things because it can go outinto the world, maybe far, far away, and you can never reach everyone who mighthave heard it. And you can never know how the lie might change people beforethey hear the truth, if they ever do.” Our visitor’s pause, his sidelong glancefrom under arched brows, accompanied by a deeply drawn breath—the “ahem”look—momentarily puzzled me. Then I realized he thought I had unconsciously“slipped,” that I was speaking of myself, not my detractors and the media! Howcan one reply to the unspoken? Confused, I groped unsuccessfully for words, thenrealized in frustration there was nothing I could say which wouldn’t deepen hisconviction. I’m sure my expression only further confirmed to him his assumption.One community might have welcomed me with open arms: the UFO community. I wasrepeatedly invited to attend their gatherings, but I rarely accepted. Thatwasn’t a put-down of those people. It’s just that I’d had enough of thecontroversy, the reaction, the subject. My best coping strategy was simply totry to get on with my life and live it as normally as possible.I sold off my hot cars and my Chevy Nomad (“the Wanderer”—my first name comesfrom an ancient word for traveler). I kept a modest four-door sedan with asix-cylinder, a Mercury Comet. (Now come on, lots of cars have such names, andmost of the cars I’ve owned have come to me by chance circumstance rather thanconscious choice.)I became quite conservative in my conduct. No motorcycles. No more risky stuff.The car doesn’t move till everyone is buckled up. My driving record in the lasttwenty years has been perfect—how many people can say that? I am one of the veryfew fathers who has never missed a parent-teacher meeting. Even when I have hadto take off work to attend, I’ve almost never missed one of my kids’ play orperformance. I really turned inward in the sense of focusing myself on family,home, yard, and my personal studies (which haven’t included ufology).If I had had any illusions it would all go away if I ignored it long enough, itwas a futile effort. I found out that when I turned down requests forinterviews; often it didn’t kill the project, it merely changed it for theworse. There would be many more errors and a much more negative slant than if Ihad simply agreed.I consented to several television appearances where I met a few famous people.What with finding our names all through the media, one might expect the wholebusiness would go to our heads, that we’d start acting different and putting onairs. So what effect did becoming famous (or notorious in some eyes) have on uspersonally? The surprising answer is—almost none. All seven of us were toototally blown away by the impact of the experience itself to be much starstruckby the sudden worldwide interest.I’ve been so proud that none of it had changed me in that way, but heck, itdidn’t have much apparent effect on the other six, either. Of course, theyhaven’t had nearly the experience I did, but I have to hand it to those guys.They eventually got on with their lives pretty much as if Turkey Springs hadnever happened. So why should I act as if it had made me special? Theextraordinary thing was the event itself. I’m only the man it happened to.Although it didn’t confer on me an exaggerated sense of myself, to travel to abig-city television station and see some of those famous persons was a novelexperience. Meeting the hosts was something quite by itself—but knowing how anyother ordinary red-blooded American male would have felt to be asked to sit inthe very same chair that seconds earlier had been warmed by Raquel Welch—well,maybe you can see why I was proud to have remained unaffected. I met soccer starPele in the green room at Good Morning, America. I met some child stars whosemixture of precociousness and a saccharine, typically-adorable-kid act seemed alittle incongruous. All this was long before Fire in the Sky.It was particularly intriguing to me that a couple of stars I had occasion tospend time with were persons who had special meaning to me. Of all the hundredsof celebrities I might have encountered, why did I meet those whose work hadmade such a difference to me? I had dinner and spent an evening with CliffRobertson, whose Oscar-winning performance in the movie Charly and role as J.W.Coop constituted only part of his significance to me. His principled stand oncertain real-life issues was the main basis of my great respect for him.Then there was Leonard Nimoy. I was never a Trekkie (oops, excuse me, I meanTrekkir) and, believe it or not, I’m probably one of the few Americans who hasyet to see every last episode of the perpetually syndicated and rerun originaltelevision series, Star Trek.But Nimoy’s characterization of the eminently logical Mr. Spock was something Ibelieve made a positive mark on an entire culture. It gave embodiment (largelylacking elsewhere) to a respectable role model for young people with an interestin logic and reason. Only my boyhood reading of the Sherlock Holmes storiescompares in personifying those ideals for me. What could a culture such as oursneed more for the upcoming generation than popular paragons of the intellect,charismatic mentors of the mind? It is said that one of the most tellingmeasures of a society is who it chooses for its heroes.Because of our work together on the set of The Unexplained, I had a chance totalk awhile with Nimoy, which was quite (forgive me) fascinating. He doesn’tremotely resemble the emotionless being of his alter ego. (I later learned thatbesides his success as a director of some heartfelt movies, Nimoy is the authorof a number of volumes of exquisitely sensitive verse.)I suppose our meeting made more of an impression on him than I expected. Overtwo years later, after hosting a program that included many episodes concerningUFO incidents, he was interviewed concerning his views on UFOs. He was quoted assaying that mine was one of the most impressive accounts he’d ever heard. “It’sa bizarre story, but after speaking with him over a period of several hours, Ifelt he was being truthful.”Subsequent to her being taken into custody, I received a postcard with a briefgreeting signed, Patty Hearst. After hearing of some supposed connection betweenher and basketball star Bill Walton (no known relation to me), and the fact thatthe card came postmarked from where she was at the time, I didn’t think it tooimprobable that it was genuine. However, I’ve never had the handwritingauthenticated.When world heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali moved his training camp tothis area nine months after the UFO incident, most locals bought the explanationhe was trying to get away from the crowds of gawkers and hustlers hanging aroundhis Michigan facility. The gregarious, exhibitionistic, microphone-devouring,camera-mugging, “most-recognized face on the planet” Ali, seeking to get awayfrom all the attention? If you believe that, there’s a bridge you’d probablybuy.Perhaps Ali, master of media, was wise enough not to tell reporters what reallybrought him here. Of all the places in the world to train (and he could affordto go literally anywhere), would he choose the Mogollon Rim area solely for itsfresh air and scenery? Maybe so. This is the place, out of any, where I chooseto live.One place he showed up a few months before he arrived here was Phoenix—at theboxing gym where my brother Duane trained—looking for sparring partners. Aliwanted somebody quick and with a style similar to his upcoming opponent, JimmyYoung. If you wanted quick, Duane was the man to see—or try to see. He couldliterally jab twice in less time than most men took trying to block the firstone. But Duane was astounded at Ali’s stamina. He’d spar Duane, then each of theothers in the gym, and get back around to Duane—over and over—none the worse forwear. On April 30, 1976, in Landover, Maryland, naturally Jimmy Young lost aunanimous decision to Ali. In August Ali came here, set up his trainingfacilities at the Show Low Airport (in the very airplane hangar where I hadworked to pay for my private-pilot training), and began training there for hisSeptember 28, 1976, match with Ken Norton.I later learned Muhammad Ali had been deeply into UFOs for years, and that he’dhad distinct sightings, which others had witnessed, prior to each of his majorfights. He told reporter Timothy Becklay he’d seen UFOs eighteen times. One ofhis most sensational sightings was over his mountaintop training camp inPennsylvania, as he prepared for a bout with George Foreman. Another of hisbetter sightings was in the mid-sixties, while driving along the New JerseyTurnpike, when an enormous UFO with glowing portholes buzzed his car. He said:“The thing was so huge that I could see its shadow on the highway—it coveredboth lanes.”Ali’s famous Central Park sighting was reported in one newspaper account to haveoccurred in 1971, and 1967 in a television account (unless there were twosightings). The sighting was witnessed by his entire entourage. His trainer,Angelo Dundee, was quoted as saying, “It was a real big sucker.” Sports reporterBill Verigan: “We all saw them. There were several of them up in the sky . . .they were objects . . . they were lights. . . It hovered for what seemed like avery long time, which was perhaps a minute or less and then just, whoosh,disappeared behind the buildings. Ali was extremely excited. He startedscreaming, I can remember, he kept yelling, ‘It’s the Mothership! It’s theMothership!’ ”Angelo Dundee confirmed separately: “Muhammad was deep into the Mothershiproutine, because I heard it many, many times, many, many places.” Angelo Dundeewas a close enough friend to be able to joke about it, but not too much. “Isaid, ‘Muhammad, when those guys come down, please let me meet ’em, I want tomanage one of those, train one of those guys’—’cause it would of been a first.So, we made a little joke out of it and my own little one. But he was serious.Forget about joke, he felt and believed something was following him.” ReporterBill Verigan said: “He apparently believed that this was perhaps the coming of amessenger in one of these spacecraft.”Ali believed if he remained faithful and humble he would continue to be blessedas one chosen to use his status to achieve his earthly missions, that Allahwould continue to smile upon his victories.Muhammad Ali was quoted saying: “The late Elijah Muhammad, my religious leader,said the first reference ever made about UFOs was Ezekiel’s biblical descriptionof a wheel within a wheel. He also says there is a ship known as the Mother ofPlanes that is a half-mile long. I think this is what I observed over mytraining camp.”A few things happened while he was here that don’t warrant mention here, butmaybe living for a few weeks in accommodations far less luxurious than he wasaccustomed to, and training in an old airplane hangar, were worth being able tojog through this remote forest for some fresh air and scenery. And, oh yes,getting away from those pesky crowds. But then, he was continuously throngedthroughout his stay, and the sociable champ seemed to enjoy every minute of it.Now, I know I’ve said I didn’t see a necessary connection between religion andUFOs, but apparently Ali does. Who am I to say? Maybe Ali knows something Idon’t. After all, he won that September 28, 1976, fight against Ken Norton, too.Not all contact with celebrities was positive. I was scathingly snubbed by oneparticular prime-time macho television star. I never even spoke to him, but herefused to share a green room with me and demanded that his segment of the showbe moved to precede rather than follow mine. C ’est la vie.In the makeup room on another show, a certain beautiful young television starletgushed easy friendliness, adoringly held my baby son Cliff, and gave us anautographed publicity photo of herself. Later, back at my hotel, I stepped intoan elevator. I hadn’t known where she was staying, so I was surprised when Iglanced over and saw her with her publicist. We were the only ones in there,but, having heard how stars hate to be bothered during their off hours, I didn’tstare, and said nothing. When we exited the elevator, I let them go first. As weheaded toward the lobby, I heard her warble the Twilight Zone theme music to hercompanion, glancing back at me with a mocking laugh. Ouch.The fact that I can bring myself to relate such incidents is a measure of howfar I’ve come. I used to get really depressed after some of the worse ones.People who did know me well weren’t a problem. I don’t want to seem boastful,but actually the people who know me best make it clear they view me as anexceptionally rational person. They seek my opinion on their most difficultproblems. Time after time, people who get to know the real me, end up telling methey were really surprised I was nothing like what they had expected. Also,again and again, journalists who do an in-depth interview say the same thing—notat all what they expected.In fact, I don’t recall a single person getting to know me and going away lessbelieving than before. This is often the case when the subject isn’t evendiscussed (I never bring it up on my own). Even when it is discussed, I nevertry to convince anyone: I just lay it on the table for them to take or leave asthey see fit. I do vigorously rebut all false charges of my critics if they arebrought up, but that is another matter. Biding is not ceding. Neutrality is notpassivity.Such people need not specify what they mean by “what they expected.” I alreadyknow only too well. To a great extent I’ve come to terms with disbelief itself.After all, this is amazing stuff. Why shouldn’t people initially have difficultyaccepting it?An unexpected side effect of disbelief, and even of belief, is one of my biggesttroubles. It might surprise people to learn that one thing that has brought alot of frustration and pain into my life since 1975, is that the incident hasessentially made the real me invisible.How can the subject of so much media attention possibly feel unseen? Well, Icertainly don’t mean in the public sense, because I avoided most media requests.In that sense, I’m a private type of person who would certainly have felt morecomfortable with much less of that sort of interest.What I mean by becoming invisible is being unable to get through to people as anordinary guy on a personal level. My first contact with each new person iscompletely dominated by their perception of the incident, filtered through thedistorting lens of their beliefs about what happened to me as a young man.Positive reactions have this effect as much as negative ones. The incident couldhave happened to anyone. I haven’t done anything special or heroic. I don’t wantto be regarded as a hero or celebrity for this, any more than I want to beviewed as a deceiving rascal or some crackpot space-cadet. I want to be judgedon the basis of what I am, not what’s happened to me.This was the final dimension to my isolation. I really simply gave up on formingpositive new relationships with people, not because I didn’t yearn for suchcontact, but because it was futile. The pain of estrangement was less than thepain of seeing someone who could have become a friend not become one, onlybecause he couldn’t see the real me. I fell back on the vague hope that “maybesomeday things will be different.”For one who was told all his life he could become just about anything, who oncefelt the whole world was open to him, it was particularly crushing finally tocome to the stark realization that, on account of a single decision, certainavenues of life were forever closed to me.However, it’s always best to look for the positive in whatever negatives wemight encounter in life. Even in the worst circumstances, with no apparent goodin the events themselves, one can at least look for the lesson to be learned.So, unexpectedly, I’ve grown gradually to see some positive aspects in theaftermath. I’ve mentioned the insight into humanity I’ve gained. I’ve broadenedmy perspective, looking at small events more in terms of the overall scheme ofthings.All those benefits are, it bears repeating, an outgrowth of the immenseisolation—the feeling of being set apart—I’ve endured all these years. I supposeit’s only natural I would take this view of the matter, because I’ve always useda similar mental technique in trying to make sense of complex problems. As Idescribed earlier, “stepping outside” is a way of getting a clearer picture ofthings. It’s like stepping between two mirrors hung directly opposite eachother, and seeing—ahead and behind—two series of identical, regressing imagesvanishing into an infinite series of successively smaller likenesses. The keylandmark, we come to realize, is ourselves, the very self I had sought tomomentarily step outside of.In the struggle to survive and adapt, my isolation became a gigantic,not-so-temporary version of my earlier reasoning strategy. I believe that beingon the outside looking in has given me exceptional opportunities to see from amore objective, realistic perspective—and, more importantly, the crucialcapacity to comprehend the pricelessness of such insight.I’m the only one of the seven who still lives in Snowflake. Most of them leftfor far-flung places almost immediately after the incident. People have oftenasked why, in the face of such reactions, didn’t Dana and I move away? Theanswer is that, in the first place, I don’t think the reaction here in Snowflakewas much different from what it would have been anywhere in the nation. Andsecondly, even if it would have been easier elsewhere, I’m not inclined to runfrom difficulty. It’s usually better to confront things and let the chips fallwhere they may. Not that we didn’t seriously consider the option a few times.But my wife’s roots run pretty deep here; and I could never live with thefeeling I’d run out with my tail down.What about the other guys? Has the incident’s aftermath had similar effects onthem? Most of the guys say they’ve been ribbed about it on occasion, but werebasically able to get on with their lives without too much negative impact.I recently saw Allen Dalis face-to-face for the first time since right after ithappened. Allen had reached the culmination of his life’s problems, unrelated tothe incident, and wound up serving a couple of years of a five-year sentence forrobbery. Detractors tried to make the most of this turn of events with acontemptible shot at “guilt by association,” which recoiled on them. But it wasAllen who turned himself in. He knew he needed help for his personal problems,so as part of his rehabilitation he came clean, confessed to everything he’dever done. (By the way, if our story had been false, he’d have confessed that,too.) Allen’s counselors reported he’d made very good progress, and he earnedearly release. Allen says he’s changed his ways and hasn’t had any major troublesince. He emphasizes that he’s paid his debt to society, it’s a thing of thepast. He wishes everyone would simply forget it.In fairness and common sense, if we don’t give people another chance, we removethe motivation for them to reform. Allen is at present over in western Arizona,back working in the woods for part of the season and as an auto mechanic therest of the year. He says he’s settled down and is finally considering marriagein the near future. Something else surprising: Allen has displayed a remarkabletalent for art! I’m not talking about merely drawing well. His work is actuallyof professional caliber. None of us had any idea Allen had that in him.Before I continue with what’s been happening over the years to the rest of thecrew, I’d like to pause here to commend my coworkers on their courage inreturning to the site of the incident to search for me. It’s totallyunderstandable to me that they argued about whether they should go back. Manypeople would have just kept going. If they had continued into town to get help,many people would not have done more.No one can fairly criticize them for their emotional breaks, nor for theirinitial action of fleeing the craft. I would challenge the bravest man to reactdifferently under the same conditions. They had no weapons. What could they do?Get out of the pickup and throw rocks at the craft? From what they describe theyhad good reason to believe me dead; to attempt a rescue at that point wouldn’thave been sensible. Any other course of action would have seemed not courageous,but suicidal.I can only thank them for their concern and the disregard for their own personalsafety they displayed in returning. All six of these men deserve respect, notcriticism, for how they behaved under extreme circumstances.John, Dwayne, and Steve refusing to return that night with the sheriff’s searchparty in no way diminishes their courage earlier that evening. However, I wouldlike to extend an extra measure of thanks to the other three for going backagain, so soon, in the dark.Allen Dalis might have seemed to be one of the most terrified as the crew fled.But overcoming his fear to volunteer to return with the lawmen makes that muchgreater of an impression. Ken Peterson and Mike seem to have acted mostconsistently with what they felt they had to do. But this is also to beexpected, since they were the oldest, most responsible men on the crew.Steve Pierce has withdrawn from the whole issue more than the others, but thatmay have been the wisest course anyway. He doesn’t like to talk about it, and Ithink I know where he’s coming from. His first marriage broke up overdifficulties typical of couples who marry young. (But he’s remarried and seemsto have his life on track.) Financial difficulties add to the pressure on anymarriage, no matter the main source of trouble. Right after the incident andafter we’d lost our forest jobs, Steve was offered ten thousand dollars to denyhis UFO experience. Steve was tempted, but, at bottom, was too honest to perjurehis testimony. So he refused the offer and went into the army shortlythereafter.John Goulette’s marriage at the time of the incident also broke up, but he soonremarried, remaining with the same woman all these years. He’s also remained atthe same job, operating farm machinery and tending to all the usual duties of aranch hand, on a spread owned by his wife’s family. He’s on a pretty even-keeledcourse, apparently.Ken Peterson has remained Ken Peterson. He’s continued quietly to pursue hisspiritual leanings with various inquiries, but nothing all-consuming orfanatical: only a restless questing for growth which he’s periodically renewedover the years. He’s remained a steady worker in a variety ofconstruction-related trades—drywall, building maintenance, house painting—aswell as some social work. He’s recently divorced, but a devoted family man wholikes to spend time with his sons.I was finally able to locate Dwayne Smith after all these years, and reached himby telephone. He has returned to his home turf in Oklahoma, where he’s worked asan electrician for the last ten years. He has two sons and a daughter. He sayshe always has handled the ribbing with good humor. “I’ve always, and stilltoday, when things are thick, when the air is really thick with crap, I try tomake light of it, you know. And now I’m even better at it, now I do it where Ipretty much try not to hurt anybody.” I think Dwayne meant hurting others’feelings, even though being so big undoubtedly encourages people to avoidaggravating him at any rate. He’s put on nearly a hundred pounds since 1975. Ihaven’t actually seen him since then, but imagine him with his Hulk Hoganmustache, his six-foot-seven frame, up on western boots with a cowboy hat ontop, weighing over 250 pounds. Combine that picture with his positive attitude,and one can see why he’s never felt much negative energy from the aftermath ofTurkey springs.Compared to the rest of the crew, I know a bit more about Mike Rogers’ life overthe intervening years. He had been my best friend, and I’m married to hissister. So even when we weren’t speaking, I heard all about him from his family.Like most of the other guys, Mike endured a divorce in the wake of the incident.I know how this must look, but I don’t think any of these divorces were directlycaused by the incident. I believe they’re simply a symptom of social problems ingeneral. It’s everywhere. Society seems to have opted for an array of conditionswhich place enormous pressure on the nuclear family.Not only do I not see the incident as a wedge between these couples, it seemedthat nearly every one of us sought the arms of a woman in our readjustment tolife. John, Steve, and Dwayne—all three of them—married within a few monthsafter the incident. All three of them soon fathered new babies. The two men whowere already married, Mike and Ken, both conceived with their wives within a fewmonths after their experience; each had a son. I, too, married, and our firstchild was a son. All our children have been perfectly normal and healthy inevery respect. Mike has always been big on his kids (of which there are nowmany). When his marriage ended he received primary custody, although thechildren have lived with both parents at times.Mike has appeared to me pretty depressed in his outlook on life since thesighting. I don’t think he would ever attribute his subdued spirits to hismarital breakup, but I personally think it was a factor. But only one factor outof many, including changes in his relationships—not only with me, but everybodyimportant to him, and many people unimportant to him. Another factor, of which Idon’t think he is aware, is the consequence of some philosophical turns in histhinking, which have led him into what I consider positions out of sync with histrue needs.One way he describes the feeling he is left with—something all the guys felt atfirst, but got past—is with a phrase I used in my first book, The WaltonExperience: that of a “stripped ego,” which I’ll explain once more in myconclusion in chapter 15.Mike used to be Mr. Ego as much as either my brother Duane or I, but now a bitof the edge is gone. Maybe for all of us. I could write off that change as aneffect of general maturity, if it hadn’t coincided so exactly with the incident.On the other hand, there was much about those days which demanded instantmaturity. Sink or swim.In any event, like all of us, Mike has adjusted. “Fall back and regroup” is themilitary term. Reconcile, amend, revise, and carry on.And carry on he has. Mike returned to work in the woods for a while, built somehouses, put his artistic talents to use in designing and painting signs foroutdoor advertising. I joined him in some of those projects. One accomplishmentwhich particularly impressed the Forest Service was coming up with a way tomechanize with heavy equipment much of the work we had been doing by hand andwith chainsaws.In the area of traditional logging, there is no more prestigious work towoodsmen in the Southwest than cutting timber on the North Rim of the GrandCanyon. Just as with the Sitgreaves National Forest, most of the world isunaware of the lush timberlands just north of the Canyon. The usual photographsof the area give the impression of desert. But some of the biggest and best firtimber in the state grows there.Loggers here consider work up there to be (to borrow a phrase) “not just a jobbut an adventure.” Only the best get on and Mike was hired immediately. This washis hermit phase. During one of his seasons up there he lived alone in a cabin.Part of the time he camped in a tent. One campsite was out on a place calledFire Point: golden sunlight glowing on huge trees growing impossibly dense nextto a sheer cliff thousands of feet straight down, and beauty so wilddescriptions sound like a fairy tale.Logging up there is a society to itself, but Mike did well there right off thebat. Performance is closely monitored with complex scorecards measuring boardfeet and a variety of detailed specifications. Mike’s scores were higher thanthose of many of the more experienced sawyers. To be able to work so rapidly andaccurately, yet remain uninjured in an occupation so dangerous, requiresextraordinary ability. Mike received only one minor injury to his ankle.We’ve seen a number of men we knew killed over the years. Logging is thenumber-one most hazardous line of work in the United States, with the highestnumber of work-related injuries and deaths of any industry, including mining andagriculture. That point is emphasized by the 1993 nationwide news report of thelogger forced to save his own life by using his pocketknife to cut off his ownmangled leg. Freeing himself from the fallen tree which had him pinned so thathe would have bled to death otherwise, he tied off the stump of his leg, crawleda great distance to his log skidder, drove that to his pickup, then drovehimself to get help. They retrieved his leg, but I never heard whether surgeonswere able to reattach it. Hard work, hard men.In his first year of competition Mike entered every loggers’ contest held inArizona and every time placed first, second, or third against a dozen, twodozen, or more experienced, seasoned competitors. This is a serious sport tomany of the world’s hardiest men and there are national and world competitions.In some of these contests the overall winner gets the title of “Logger of theYear.” There are three main categories of competition: ax, saw, and physical. Inthe ax category there are a variety of chopping events and the most popularevent of the whole contest) ax throwing. Mike did very well at this.In the saw category there is quite a variety of events measuring skill, speed,and accuracy. It’s much more than super equipment. Some events don’t even allowthe use of competitor-owned saws. You have events that combine speed andaccuracy to an astonishing degree. Using heavy, powerful saws that plow throughtough logs like butter, they make cuts where winning scores are measured infractions of both inches and seconds. One event they had at the Angelfire, NewMexico, contest was accuracy felling, which is the ability to control thedirection the tree falls by cut alone—no push allowed.The physical events emphasize strength and endurance but still require aconsiderable component of skill. There are events involving throwing green logsso heavy they’re hard to lift, let alone throw. The log toss, not the same asthe log throw, involves timed hurling of a number of smaller though still heavy)logs onto a pile. Log rolling is a timed event in which massive green logs aremoved across a certain distance and back with a cant hook on a pole. But thewoodsman has to pass the ends of the log (which is tapered, making it veer)through the narrow gap between two pegs and arrive at the goal with his logcentered enough to hit two pegs which are only slightly closer together than thelength of his log. Then he must return the same way.Mike came in without ever having even watched these events and surprisedeveryone with his performance against men who’d been doing it for years, andsome of these guys were much larger than Mike. Writing this book makes me lookback over the years for perspective on all the changes that have occurred, bothpersonal and global. Who would have predicted the breakup of the Soviet Union?After adjusting our thinking to such far-reaching realignment of world affairs,we must now hope it doesn’t turn out to be less of a blessing than it firstseemed.Earlier, in March 1982, came the death of Ayn Rand. Her inevitable passing wasin a sense less of a tragedy than the manner in which news of her death washandled in the media. A few mentions, nothing remotely commensurate with heraccomplishments and with her “contributions” (a word to which she might takeexception in its literal sense) to human understanding. At the same time, newsof the self-destructive death of a bloated, drug-saturated nihilistic comic waseverywhere, which the enthralled media endlessly bewailed and examined,eulogized and dissected, in fascinated detail. The spectacle was dragged outmorbidly for months, while the passing of Ayn Rand, one of the most phenomenalminds of modern times, generated a few brief mentions and was quickly forgotten.Much has happened, but 1986 was a particularly significant year to me. Beginningin January, we witnessed the fiery, midflight explosion of the space shuttleChallenger. Nothing I can say here could add to what’s been said about thatheartrending catastrophe. I watched it on live television along with the rest ofthe world. The meaning of that moment extended beyond words, beyond theimmeasurable loss of the crew, beyond the staggering financial loss of merehardware, beyond the effect on the U.S. space program, beyond the politicalfallout, beyond the endless analysis and recriminations. It contained amonumental symbolism best understood without words, and a particular dimensionof personal significance I could never communicate.Then in April 1986 (two days before the meltdown and explosion at Chernobyl),the world-renowned astronomer and ufologist, Dr. J. Allen Hynek died. The braintumor which was the ultimate cause of his death had first interfered with hisspeech. His embarrassment at that loss caused him to refuse to see most people.When I spoke with him near the end, it was saddening to see this once articulateman stop in mid-sentence to grope for the simplest words. I believe I had senseda genuine warmth from him in our relationship.In 1910, when J. Allen Hynek was a newborn infant only five days old, his fathercarried him up onto their roof to see the glowing plume of earth's most famouscelestial nomad—Halley’s Comet. This was a touching scene—it recalls for me themoment in Roots where the father holds his baby up to the night sky and says,“Behold, the only thing greater than yourself!”—and a prophetic one. He grew upto become one of the best-known modern astronomers. As Chair Professor ofAstronomy at Chicago’s Northwestern University, he often told his students ofHailey’s Comet: “I hope to see it again before I go out.” It was another oflife’s twists that just before he died he did see Hailey’s Comet return onschedule, to blaze a path across the skies of the Northern Hemisphere. (It isillogical to attach undue significance to coincidence. With an orbital period soclose to an average human lifespan, it is inevitable that known figures mighthave birth and death dates so coincide. Mark Twain is one example.)His legacy contributed greatly to the adoption of a scientific approach to afield sometimes dismally lacking in science. He leaves behind a massive body ofwork, and the two organizations he founded: the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS)in Chicago, Illinois, and the International Center for UFO Research (ICUFOR) inScottsdale, Arizona. His contributions to ufology are too numerous to list.However, regarding my association with him, I can only express my appreciationfor his honest curiosity, circumspect fairness, and his courage to call it as hesaw it.A few months later, on August 28, 1986, Jim Lorenzen, international director andcofounder of APRO, died at age sixty-four. Jim and his wife Coral started APROin 1952 and published the APRO Bulletin continuously for over thirty years. JimLorenzen and Allen Hynek had been colleagues, with a mild rivalry, over theyears. Hynek didn’t found CUFOS until twenty years after APRO. Also, hisposition on UFOs had been pretty skeptical all through his years as a consultantfor the U.S. Air Force on Project Blue Book. Hynek’s beliefs gradually shiftedduring his last years with the air force which probably contributed to theirdecision to terminate his consulting contract). The turning point for Hynekseemed to come in the wake of public reaction to his infamous “swamp gas”verdict on a case he investigated in the mid-1960s. Jim, and especially Coral,viewed APRO as the original UFO investigation group, and later groups like CUFOSas territorial infringers, with this particular upstart’s (Hynek’s) previousanti-UFO stance making the interloper undeserving of addressing the material.Jim and Coral Lorenzen did more for me in the aftermath of my experience, byfar, than any other agency I came in contact with. Their approach wasnonexploitative, scientific and objective. Something which really drove home tome the true objectivity with which Jim Lorenzen approached my case was anexchange we had while en route to a television program on which we were toappear together. We were sitting in an airport waiting for a connecting flight.I took the opportunity to thank him for standing by me when so many people weredown on my case. He turned, looked me in the eye, and spoke with an unexpectedsternness I never heard before or after. He said evenly: “Don’t thank me forthat. Because if I thought for one minute that your case wasn’t genuine, I’d sayso.”Early in our association I’d referred to Jim as “Dr.” Lorenzen. He hastened tocorrect my error, but it was an easy mistake to make. Jim Lorenzen was a veryintelligent man. Some of the inventions he was working on in optics,electronics, and music were amazingly ingenious. It’s regrettable that he neverhad funds to pursue them to fruition. His work on the Kitt Peak telescope washighly skilled and spoke well for his scientific competence. He was well versedin proper research procedure, with a broad understanding of basic science,though never one to put on airs. He looked the part of a scientist, too. He’dhad his beard, he told me, before Hynek’s, when I commented on their physicalresemblance.What is really ironic is that these two men, so prominent in the same field,should both fall prey to the same disease (prostate cancer, which had spread),and that, even though neither knew of the other’s illness at first, both diedwithin a few months of each other.What’s become of the lawmen involved? After more than twenty-eight years ofservice, Town Marshal Sanford “Sank” Flake left office under a cloud, with theDPS coming to investigate how he had conducted his office. Although a few minordeficiencies were noted when his procedures were compared with those used inbig-city police departments, no major offense was ever publicly cited. It lookedas if they had come looking for an excuse to justify their actions and citedthings which seemed kind of silly to me. I don’t know many of the details ofwhat went on there, because local newspaper accounts were a little cryptic, butit looked to me as if he’d been railroaded. He and his wife then left to dooverseas church missionary work.Some writers and reporters tried to portray Sanford Flake as a dumb, sadistic,rednecked hick, a caricature of the small-town southern sheriff. This was highlyunfair and highly inaccurate. Sank can sing and play the guitar well, and haspainted many works of western art of respectable quality. I still take exceptionto misguided innuendos he made concerning my mother, but I’ll call a spade aspade: Sank’s slow western drawl belies his quick wit.After losing an election bid for sheriff, Undersheriff (Chief Deputy) Ken Coplanleft law enforcement for good. Last I heard, he was driving a gas truck inanother part of the state.Glen Flake was one of the county sheriff's deputies back in November 1975, buthad been sheriff twice before that, and was elected sheriff again when MarlinGillespie retired. After a law enforcement career that spanned over twenty-nineyears, Glen’s last day as the Navajo County Sheriff seemed uneventful. He’dturned in his county car, checked out at the main office and gone home. On NewYear’s Eve 1988, four and a half hours before his third term would be officiallyover, his dispatcher called to tell him one of his deputies had been shot.Accompanied by another officer, he immediately left for the scene running“code”—fast, lights and siren on. After all those years without a single officerfatality, Glen Flake’s deputy, Bob Varner himself due to retire soon), had madea routine traffic stop when a maniac with a companion jumped out of a car andput a burst of automatic-weapons fire into Varner’s chest.When they arrived at the scene they found another officer pinned undermachine-gun fire. Flake and his men set out in pursuit of the two gunmen, whocontinued to stop at intervals to shoot back at the lawmen. The cars of the lawenforcement men were riddled with bullets. In the darkness the gunmen drovetheir car off into a concrete-lined ditch. SWAT teams surrounded the car, onlyto discover the pair had escaped on foot. They reached a farmhouse where theytied up the couple who lived there, stealing their car. One of the gunmen shothimself to death just before capture; the other escaped, and was later capturedwithout any shooting. Quite a last day on the job for Glen Flake.Marlin Gillespie completed a long career in law enforcement December 31, 1984.After four years in the navy he’d joined the Sheriff’s Department in 1957. (He’dbeen chief deputy during Glen Flake’s 1984 term as sheriff.) Even after morethan twenty-seven years in the Sheriff’s Department, the last decade as Sheriff,Gillespie didn’t actually retire. He was elected to the county board ofsupervisors, where he’s actively served ever since.I didn’t know it at the time, but Gillespie shared my interest in motorcycling.(An interest to which I’ve begun to return . . . indication of how much I’verecovered?) He and his wife have logged an astounding number of miles on twowheels, covering nearly the entire United States. Since Gillespie was also agood family man, they also often went on weekend back-country camp-outs, eachfamily member on his or her own bike. Their youngest son was fatally injured ina motorcycle accident in 1975. Dealing with that personal tragedy in the middleof the Turkey Springs uproar must have made things much harder for him, but heperformed as professionally as ever. It makes you wonder how he finds time forit all, since he’s always been active in a variety of community services. He wasa very popular sheriff, a hard thing to be in a position where, inevitably, yourevery action is sure to offend someone.When, in preretirement interviews for the local papers, Gillespie was asked whatwere some of the most outstanding investigations of his career, he cited two.One was the murder of Freddie Jensen. Jensen’s body was found by two ApacheIndians on horseback, about twenty-five miles from Whiteriver on thereservation, facedown, dead for several days, no identification. In spite ofinitial difficulty identifying the victim, an intensive investigation byGillespie’s department led to solving the crime. The complexity of the case, thequality of the sleuthing, and the bizarreness of some of the clues (the victimwas one of those rare individuals whose internal organs are reversed from normalarrangement, right for left) led to the case being written up in the nationalmagazine Inside Detective.The other case he cited was ours. The Herald wrote: “The most baffling was theTravis Walton UFO incident. ‘For a month I had telephones growing out of bothears,’ the sheriff said. This was another case that was reported across thenation and all over the world. It never was proved true or untrue that thepeople involved had seen something. But it still puzzles him, as well as otherswho might recall the incident.”What with all the comings and goings, deaths and divorces, it seemed everyonewas changing but me. While my phone was disconnected and I was avoidinginterviews, the controversy raged on in my absence. Skeptics and ufologistscontinued to debate the merits of the case. Even in the absence of much of thedata included in this book, a general consensus emerged.When journalists came seeking interviews, they would tell me they'd checked withthe experts in the field. Whether they’d asked for the most interesting, mostwitnessed, most controversial, best-known or best-documented case, the answerthey received was always the incident at Turkey Springs in 1975. It is the onlyabduction case with witnesses, and the only one ever reported to authoritieswhile the person was still missing.So they came to me, with their self-contradictory approach: “Give me the top UFOstory so that my [article, documentary, book, movie] will make me a success.”But: “Of course, I know you really wouldn’t want to be paid much, if at all,because, since your experience is real, you couldn’t care at all about money.”Accepting their hypocritical messages, I was embarrassed by any payment Ireceived for various appearances, although rarely if ever did it do more thancover my expenses. I was afraid if I accepted the opportunities—I certainly hadto accept the liabilities—resulting from the incident, my credibility would bedamaged. The writers were right to that degree: I did value credibility morethan I did fair compensation. I started turning down almost all offers withoutwaiting to hear the entire pitch. No way was I going to “sell out.”Friends hastened to advise me otherwise. “You’ve a perfect right to thoseopportunities,” they reasoned. “It couldn’t even begin to make up for what it’scost you. It’s no different from anyone telling of an unusual life experience.”They said, “It’s like people accusing the guys who survived that plane crash inthe wilderness, of deliberately downing their plane and enduring the hell ofcannibalism just so they could sell their story. It doesn’t matter what yourdetractors say, they’d suspect you in any case.” They told me to get out thereand make the most of my experience.But I didn’t care about that. I felt, as the line ran in one of the songs aboutour experience, “Leave me alone and give me time to think.” At that time I wouldhave preferred to have it all forgotten."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 14The Making of FireWho teach the mind its proper face to scan,And hold the faithful mirror up to man.—Robert Lloyd, from The ActorAfter a number of years, things began to quiet down a little. Letters came lessfrequently. People didn’t seek me out so often—especially reporters. As always,there were programs and articles produced by journalists who didn’t do anyfirsthand research (which of course were the least accurate) but even these werefewer and farther between.It seemed safe to have a telephone reinstalled. At one point the disadvantagesof having one had heavily outweighed the advantages, but those advantages wereconsiderable. In today’s world it’s really hard to conduct your normalday-to-day affairs without a telephone.If problems developed, I could always have it taken out again, or have thepolice order the installation of another line trap by the phone company. Thepolice investigation of that early series of sick threats had put an abrupt haltto it. (Caller ID hadn’t been developed at that time.)So, I took the plunge. Welcome back to the twentieth century. What alabor-saving device the telephone is. A one-minute call spared me atwenty-minute trip. Job-related questions were quickly resolved. It was mucheasier to stay in touch with friends and relatives. And I was glad to relievesome of the isolation Dana had been enduring. Everything seemed great.But then, right off the bat I received a call from this guy named Tracy Torme.He wanted to make a movie. I’d heard it all before. A writer, director, orproducer would call, write, or come to Snowflake, to try to persuade me to grantrights for a movie to be made. I listened to some of those but eventually thesame message filtered through. The two things that put me off were (1) failingto convince me the material would not regive a sensationalistic, exploitivetreatment; and (2) no one could show me how I could avoid being perceived as“selling out” without being taken advantage of.I couldn’t see any way the net result would not be negative. My life had settledsome. I had inched forward toward being accepted for myself in a fewrelationships. What could a movie bring to my life? Stir up all the oldcontroversies, animosities, and ridicule? Wouldn’t a movie, the accompanyingresearch and promotion, result in further public dissection of me and my life?Wouldn’t it only put the bug back in the jar—this time under a spotlight?I told Mr. Torme I wasn’t interested. Still, I sensed something different It hisapproach. He seemed better informed on the facts and details of the incidentthan any of the others. So, when he persisted, wanting me to wait to make afinal decision until after he had come to Snowflake for a face-to-face meeting,I agreed. His interest in a personal meeting wasn’t especially persuasive;others had met me face-to-face.When he arrived at my house after a hectic drive through some crazy weather, hisfather, Mel Torme, called. Tracy seemed embarrassed his dad was checking on thesafety of his grown son. I thought it was neat. Neat that I got to speak to MelTorme himself, and neat that even in Hollywood, fathers could still act likedads.I was impressed with Tracy’s sincerity when he emphasized his intent to staytrue to the material. There didn’t seem to be any sense in his paying such closeattention to the details of the incident if he didn’t plan to stay true to thosedetails. During his stay he continued to investigate the incident closely andimpartially. I took his objectivity in that regard as a sign of how he wouldtreat a dramatic interpretation of the story. But the factor that persuaded memore than anything was something he said.We were sitting in a booth at the doughnut shop across from the post office,watching the local traffic come and go outside the window. I remarked on how fewof those people seemed to base their opinions concerning the incident on thefacts; their opinions seemed to be mostly derived from their prejudices andemotions.Tracy responded that a movie would induce people to experience the sighting andits aftermath for themselves and open up their thinking about I That viewpointimmediately clicked for me. In my first book I’d expressed the desire “to putreaders where we were when it happened,” because it was the only approach Ithought capable of removing the prejudices preventing objective analysis of thefacts.It hadn’t really dawned on me there were better ways than a book to achievethat. Tracy’s comment made me immediately realize that nothing in currentexistence could equal the power of film to impart vicarious experience. Peoplemight be moved to reexamine the facts, perhaps even to seek out more completeinformation.To get people thinking: One could reach for more, but that in itself was nomodest goal.That prospect clinched it for me. I would have an opportunity to be understood,to be seen for what I really am. I’d have a chance to correct publishedmisconceptions about myself. So I signed.I don’t know whether they thought I was simply foolish, or if they finallyunderstood why, but every time it came to signing papers, they were surprisedthat the points I negotiated most earnestly were matters unconnected with themoney.One thing I wanted, but soon realized was out of the question, was the right tomaintain some say over the story’s treatment. Almost no writers, not eventop-name authors, get creative control. I came to understand why that is so.Creativity is an individual thing. On such a project, to share the creativecontrol (in films, normally the director’s prerogative) would lead to inevitabledissension, with no built-in means of resolution. To give complete creativecontrol to a writer would be the equivalent of making him the director. Whatstudio would stake the outcome of a project in which it invests tens of millionsof dollars, on the judgment of someone who might not know the first thing aboutthe various considerations to which a studio gives priority (chiefly, commercialsuccess), to say nothing of technical understanding of the filmmaking process?So I knew the minute I signed on that dotted line I was essentially relying onmy trust in the scriptwriter, Tracy Torme, to stick by our understanding.Part of my agreement was to assist in gathering permission signatures fromothers involved in the story. I pursued this diligently, putting Torme in touchwith a number of the principals. I ran into some problems, however. StevePierce’s family weren’t anxious to help me locate him. We ran out of leads inour search for Dwayne Smith. And Ken Peterson simply refused to sign. It wasn’tthe money. He felt some personal principle would be violated by his signing. Wenever figured out what it was, but his decision was final.Faced with these roadblocks, I wondered how the project could go forward. Howcould anyone have rights to his own life story, if telling it required gettingsignatures from everyone in your life? The answer came back. Permission wasn’tnecessary, but was sought anyway just for good measure. Studio lawyers are acagey lot.I finally spoke with Steve Pierce and he gave his verbal okay. Tracy would haveto fly to Texas for a meeting. Since Tracy already realized two other characterswere unlikely to be signed on, he said, “Forget it.” Anyone not on board at thispoint would simply lose his chance at a little extra cash. To appease lawyers,those persons would be replaced with fictional characters. That news didn’tbudge Kenny; so that’s how we left it.I was uneasy about fictionalizing. Would this open the floodgates to moredepartures from the original story? Tracy assured me it would not.As an interesting aside, the transformation books, including real-life stories,undergo in translation to the screen is legendary. People routinely compare thebook and the movie, expressing preference for one or the other, the fact thatthey often differ greatly not drawing comment. That situation with film leadspeople to assume that, in publishing, authors routinely turn in manuscriptswhich the publishers then substantially alter through massive “editing” soextensive it amounts to quasi ghostwriting.I don’t think that is so common as believed; it certainly hasn’t been the casewith me. Except for proofreading sorts of errors, and a certain passage myeditor suggested, correctly, would be best presented in an earlier chapter, myfirst book was published virtually word-for-word as I submitted it.(And for the record, there’s been no effort to bring this account into line withwhat the film did with the story. The greater insight and understanding I havegained since then did allow me to do more than correct errors; I’ve added thingsI’ve since remembered or discovered, and generally refined some of that earliermaterial.)Signing an agreement with a writer/producer, as I had, does not automaticallymean a movie will be made. As I was to learn, the chances are astronomicalagainst any particular script actually becoming a feature film up on the bigscreen.In terms of numbers alone, the odds are overwhelming, because only a tinyfraction of available scripts can possibly be produced. There are only so manydevelopment dollars, and ultimately only so many theater tickets that will bebought in a given time. Only a few dozen major new movies are made per year, andonly some of those are successful. Meanwhile there are nearly a hundred thousandscripts circulating on the market at any one time, with over forty thousand newones registered every year.However, there’s no shortage of hopefuls trying to generate interest in theirparticular project. The odds against us weren’t merely a matter of numbers. Itwould be bad enough if the playing field were level, but it’s far from that. Thecompetition’s first line of advantage is held by the many writers and directorswith “standing”—hugely successful track records and established connections.(Theoretically there are enough of these to fill every available slot.) Thereare those who get a hearing through extraordinary manipulation: contrivedcoincidental meetings, friend-of-a-friend connections, return of a favor,casting couch, extortion, and signature at knifepoint. (Just kidding!) Thenthere are the trend-followers: projects cloned from the last crop of successes,for which insecure decision-makers always have a compulsive attraction.This is not to imply writer/producer Tracy Torme was completely without trackrecord and connections. He was certainly averse to invoking his famous father’sname to open doors, and bristled at occasionally being introduced as “MelTorme’s son.” He had no need of nepotism. He had written the MGM occult thrillerSpellbinder, which starred Tim Daly and Kelly Preston. He’d been a successfulwriter for Canada’s award-winning SCTV, writer/filmmaker for Saturday NightLive, and executive story-editor and creative consultant for Star Trek: The NextGeneration. He wrote six episodes for the series, among them the PeabodyAward-winning “The Big Goodbye.”However, now he had his work cut out for him. Hollywood is famous for theeuphemistic decline. Refusals are routine, but rarely does anyone utter the “Nword” outright. A simple no would actually save a lot of wasted time for allconcerned, so why not? Partly because it is difficult to descend from Tinseltownhype, in which every project is “wonderful,” “tremendous,” “fantastic,” and“maaarvelous.” No one ever just “likes” something, they love it, they adore it,or they are intensely excited by it. So by this inflated currency, everythingbecomes artificially elevated.You’re lucky to get a response as direct as, “We love it, and except for thefact that [we’re already doing a similar project; the only star we'd considerfor it is totally booked this year; I love it but my partner or boss doesn’t;or, my housekeeper is ill] we’d take this project on in a minute.” Often theyjust stall.If they don’t want it, why don’t they just say so? I don’t know; maybe because,in Hollywood, no one is sure of anything. If they can keep stringing you along,they have a greater range of possibilities: what they’re “considering” won’t betaken by someone else; they can feel important and sought after. And since thebusiness favors those with good contacts, and no one can predict whichsupplicant will be tomorrow’s Tinseltown god, it’s wise not to offendcarelessly. While no one wants to be the guy who turned down someone else’smegahit, studio executives never get fired for being wrong when they say no;only when they say yes.We had many false alarms. Tracy reported each glimmer of hope accurately; goingby what he was told, time and again, we had every reason to believe we wereabout to get a movie made. And time and again it wound up a near miss.I started getting pretty cynical in my reactions to the news. I didn’t come outand say so, but I came to expect false alarms. I knew Tracy wasn’t exaggeratingthe prospects; in fact, as time went on, he downplayed them. Even so, thoseconsidering the project perpetually made its acceptance look imminent.I vacillated in my feelings. There were times when things had gone so well forme for a while that I didn’t want any form of media to come back and stir thingsup again. And there were times I wanted it to happen so as to get it over with,so I could get past the feeling of being on hold and get on with my life.At one point my agreement with Tracy and his associates expired. I agreed to letthem go on trying to market the script for free, with no contract, for quitesome time, because such an arrangement left me free to decline the whole thing,should I feel so inclined when a deal was ready to be made. I wrestled with verymixed feelings all the way along.Even though a friendship had begun to grow between us, I’m sure Tracy thought Iwas too wary and unenthused. But once burned, twice shy.As the script took shape, I initially had misgivings about any departurewhatsoever from my own perspective on the incident, let alone any materialfictionalizations. I had a lot to learn.I learned there are an indefinite number of perspectives, or “takes,” on anyreal-life series of events. For example, a war story can focus on theprotagonist’s love interest back home, his relationship to his fellow soldiers,an historical perspective, a geopolitical perspective, or combat, either ashorror or heroism. Or any number of other aspects—all of which are the story asmuch as any other.Tracy could have chosen to weave his “take” from any of a variety of threads andstill had a movie about the incident. The story could have been told from thepoint of view of any of several minor characters. It could have been done as apsychological study. It could even have been told from an archskeptic’s point ofview! The natural tendency, judging from previous offers I’d received, was tofocus on the more visually lurid aspects of aliens and spaceships.After some wrangling back and forth, I was made to understand that major studiosdon’t set out to make films for the purpose of providing scholarly expositionsor a soapbox for one person’s views. Their bottom line is—well, the bottom line.Their goal is to entertain as wide a cross-section of the population aspossible. Commercial considerations aren’t the narrow, crass, materialistic,irrelevant factors some people represent them to be. Without suchconsiderations, a movie of any perspective would quickly become impossible tobring into existence. Nothing is free; you can’t get something for nothing.Ultimately, however, I knew that only a script focused on the human story wouldsatisfy the goal I had in mind when I finally agreed to permit a movie to bemade. The best way to get people to feel what we had felt would be to have themin effect living it for themselves.However, to the disappointment of some, our story was not to receive theobvious, FX-driven, UFO-focused treatment. Instead, it emphasized the humanstory. Tracy: “. . . a study of how a single event can alter your life foreverjust by your being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Fire in the Sky is alsoabout friendship and betrayal—and forgiveness.” Producer Joe Wizan: “This is astory that speaks to human character and behavior—about our inclination topresume the worst in someone before considering ideas that challenge our ownskepticism.”Tracy Torme was true to his word in working closely with me in writing thescript. I found him an open, decent sort of person, very imaginative andintelligent, loyal to his friends—a very centered, balanced, likablepersonality. Most of those in Hollywood have egos too big (or actually toosmall, if ego equals self-esteem) to allow anyone like me to comment on orcontribute suggestions to their work. I was given the opportunity to read whathe had written as we went along, and he would listen to my reactions. Hefrequently solicited information from me. I was asked for details about the waythings really had been, minor things never before important enough to bring up.I was able to offer insight into the characters of people I knew, as to howgiven individuals might react in a given situation.The script gradually metamorphosed. The process wasn’t perfectly smooth,however. One by one, and sometimes two by two, departures from reality crept in.Sometimes I could see the reason immediately, especially when the change wascovered by the rationale which had justified an earlier alteration. Butsometimes a change didn’t make any sense to me at all; when the events that hadactually occurred were every bit as interesting, and as functional, for thescript (if not more so).We cooperated; at times we argued. Throughout these exchanges, I was ever awarethat I had no contractual power to approve or veto anything. But Tracy neverpulled that trump card on me. Nevertheless, even though I won on a few points, Iusually wound up giving in; sometimes because I was persuaded thefictionalization was justified, sometimes because I realized there was no way Icould win my point without undue long-term cost: 11 built up a “concession debt”to Tracy, I might be overdrawn when an issue arose which was really vital to me.As Tracy cast about for that just-right title for the movie, I tossed out a fewideas. I have no doubt that if I had suggested one which really nailed in, Tracywouldn’t have hesitated to accept it. However, my suggestions didn’t remotelycompare with the bull’s-eye Tracy quickly scored—Fire in the Sky.Since the script was to focus so much on the human drama and events surroundingthe incident, I wasn’t much bothered by the temporary absence from the script ofthe short segment depicting the time period aboard; it redacted my treatment ofit in my life: encapsulated and set aside for the moment.One nearly insurmountable obstacle to getting a major studio interested in theproject was the subject matter. As conventional wisdom has it, UFOs aren't anacceptable topic for major movies. Never mind that they are continually thesubject of best-selling books. Never mind that the majority of top movies in theprevious decade have had space and aliens as subject matter, Spielberg’s CloseEncounters of the Third Kind, or his all-time box-office champ, E.T.: TheExtraterrestrial.The studios would counter that no major theatrical film had ever been made abouta real-life UFO incident, and the fictional version (Close Encounters) hadalready been done. Space and aliens were possible subject matter but UFOs wereregarded as an entirely distinct category. In the insecure. imitative, bandwagonworld of Hollywood, if it hasn’t been done, there must be a good reason why not.The requirement of external validation leads to the convention of “highconcept,” pitching projects by describing them in terms of a marriage of priorhits. Fire in the Sky has been described as Close Encounters paired with,variously, Bad Day at Black Rock, The Last Picture Show, The OxBow Incident,River’s Edge, and, mockingly, as “E. T. meets Deliverance.Perhaps those cheesy old black-and-white movies of saucer invasions of earth, orthe excesses of modern tabloids, have invested the topic with an air of theridiculous. For whatever reason, the subject matter is very off-putting; thefilm was a hard sell over a six-year period. One strategy was to avoid thebaggage attached to the term “UFO” simply by emphasizing descriptions of storyelements without use of the stigmatizing acronym.I didn’t know it then, but the project’s difficulties weren’t any worse thanthose encountered in the long prehistory of many other successful movies. Eight-and ten-year concept-to-screen time spans are common. On the other hand, Tracyhad been accustomed to quick sells with his other projects. But for all we know,he may eventually discover he’d been having an unusually long run of unusuallyeasily marketed scripts. Also, at times he became completely preoccupied withother work and wasn’t able to push as vigorously on Fire as he would if he’dbeen able to give it 100 percent of his time.As I wrote earlier, during those six years there were times I wrote off theproject as something that would never be—sometimes with mild disappointment,more often with great relief. This was especially true toward the end. In fact,when we first heard Paramount might take the film under consideration, my wifeand I went for an evening walk and firmly resolved that if it didn’t go thistime, that would be the end of it. We would part as friends with Tracy, butwould agree to cease to entertain any future offerings.We continued to get word of increasingly positive signs from Paramount, but we’dseen that before. We’d long been schooled to wait until we’d gotten what’scalled the “green light” from the studio. My skepticism was such that I wasinclined to disregard the green light until all final contracts were signed.Better yet, until the cameras actually began rolling. I held off telling peopleI knew until I was certain, because I didn’t want to pay the price of stirringup buried memories in the community if there was a chance nothing would come ofit after all.Even when it came time for me to fulfill one of my obligations, to furnish thecurrent addresses of all of those who had signed releases for the film I wasn’tfully convinced. And I emphasized the film wasn’t a certainty. Nevertheless, Iwent ahead and gathered them, but again not without some difficulty.The hardest to reach was Allen Dalis. None of the old phone numbers or addressesfor Allen panned out. Former associates couldn’t be found themselves, or hadlost contact with him. His father, too, had moved. I managed to find the rightoffice in the big corporation where Allen’s father had spent his career, butthey had no active employee file on him. The overworked secretary was finallyable to locate current data in another file of retirees, but she wasn’tpermitted to release either his phone or address. I barely persuaded her toallow me to send her a stamped letter for Allen's dad, which she kindlyforwarded. Allen’s father called me, relayed my message, and Allen finallyreturned my call.Those were pretty anxious days for me, not knowing what to do. My job requiredalmost all my time and energies, but if the movie was really going to be made,there was a great deal I should be doing. I agonized over the wisdom of mydecision to grant movie rights. The scale and finality of the Paramount contractcaused all the myriad implications of my decision abruptly to dawn clear to me.I suddenly felt—deja vu—that my life was barreling forward in the grip ofenormous forces I was powerless to control.I had been leading a very conservative life, defined by control andpredictability. That way of living had been my anchor in the aftermath ofNovember 1975, but I was again adrift. Things started happening too fast. Mycoping strategy was obvious when faced with the inevitable: simply to affectwhat I could, resign myself to the remainder, and take it as it came.As part of the process of judging the project, Tracy made plans to accompany RobLieberman, who was eventually signed on as director, to Arizona to meet me andscout possible locations. Even this was not sufficient to convince me that themovie would become a reality.We went to dinner at the Longhorn Restaurant, a rustic, frontier-style placebuilt by Snowflake town marshal Sanford Flake and his brother, Navajo Countydeputy Glen Flake. We talked and got to know a little about each other.When Tracy had been pitching the project to Paramount, he’d asked me to send adozen or so photos that would give a cross-section view of my character.Lieberman had directed Robert Conrad in the made-for-television movie, Will,about G. Gordon Liddy. He spoke with scathing contempt concerning the machismoof the actor and his real-life counterpart. His remarks were so doctrinaire,anti-ego politically correct, that I realized a couple of photos of my karateand boxing must have made a very negative impression on him. (“Uh oh,” Ithought. “If this wimpy, less-macho-than-thou ubermensch is irreversiblyattached to this project, we’re screwed!” This wuss was going to take the teethand grit out of this crew of woodsmen to the point that we’d all wind up lookinglike choirboys. Within the facade of those infected with anti-ego disease aresome of the most vain, arrogant, conceited prima donnas one can imagine. I askedmyself: How is anyone going to be able to work and get along with this “Wonderof the World”?)Dana and I expressed a desire to visit the set and, for the fun of it, to appearas extras, perhaps in a crowd scene somewhere. The director was friendly andassured us he would be delighted to have us. Dinner was nice, the western decorand weathered lumber of the restaurant’s interior adding a warm countryatmosphere.After we had eaten, we went out through the wooden bat-wing doors, across theboardwalk on the front of the building to the cars. I’d felt a littleself-conscious talking in front of inquisitive customers and waitresses. We wenton back over to my house for further discussion.It went downhill from there. Soon we reached a point where the directorexpressed some skepticism about my experience. Maybe I was reading too much intothe situation, but it felt to me he had contrived a scenario, in which I wasexpected to stand up, pound the table, look everyone in the eye and tell ’em howcertain I was I’d had a real experience. I didn’t care how it affected anyone’sopinion, I felt antagonized by the situation and refused to rise to the bait.To top off our initial meeting, the next day we headed out to the site in afour-wheel-drive vehicle, piloted by their guide for location scouting—arepresentative from the Arizona Film Commission. We never made it to the site.We had almost reached it when we got stuck, burying that four-wheel-drive in asnowdrift. We spent a number of miserable hours digging ourselves out, withoutgloves, snowboots, or tools.When we were finally free the director said: “Let’s go back to Heber. I got usout twice and I don’t feel like making it a third time.” What? He got us out?All that struggle and work the rest of us did was apparently only ineffectualbumbling while the real man saved our incompetent asses. We finally made it backto Heber, wet, cold feet, starved. We wolfed some lunch, then said goodbye sothey could head off with their guide to scout locations around Arizona. As Iwalked to my van I mentally wagered the director would never choose to shootlocally.Most people would expect a great feeling of elation and celebration to accompanythe news that a part of their life was going to be turned into a major motionpicture. No such toasting occurred with us. The fact that at no clear-cut,abrupt point did I believe a movie would actually be made, created uncertaintybeyond the ambivalence I felt about doing it at all. A portion of my mixedfeelings one can probably understand from imagining oneself in my place; but theremainder is made up of things most people wouldn’t be likely to understand. AsTracy said of me in a character sketch in an earlier script: “Still waters rundeep.”Naturally the script was again being modified to meet the desires of its newowner. Too many creative minds pulling one way then another can really distortsomething so complex. People coming in so late in the game can very easilyoverlook factors only the original creator is completely aware of.Every line of a well-written script has tendrils and links and synergism withthe rest throughout. Adding to and subtracting from something so intertwined isvery difficult for a newcomer to do without inadvertently severing nerves andarteries he didn’t know were there. A short-necked, fourlegged chicken with nowings has more meat on it, but it begins to look a lot less like a chicken.We’re all familiar with the definition of a camel as being a horse designed andbuilt by committee. Tracy himself was commissioned to effect the requestedchanges. Even though his position in the production would be listed aswriter/coproducer, most of Tracy’s power to enforce his judgment likewisevanished when he signed his contract. When I learned that, it hit me with morethan a little apprehension. Were the understandings and the trust with which I’denvisioned the project now moot—neutralized? Was the story now to become wildlyaltered?Fortunately, Tracy Torme’s opinions were still respected. I felt I had an allyin the thick of things. But Tracy was coming under pressure to do someoutrageous things to the story. But Tracy knew his material inside out, andsince he’s a very well spoken, convincing person, he was able to get the moreabsurd suggestions quickly set aside.Still, I knew from my recent perusal of movie-industry literature that what arecalled “creative differences” eventually come up in nearly every single movieproduction. Would an accumulation of such confrontations eventually weakenTracy’s influence on the process? I had to rely on Tracy’s strong likability andhis past friendship with the others.In keeping with my rapport with Tracy Torme, I received copies of each newrewrite of the script. During preproduction I received one of the more finalversions. Many of the changes were clearly for the better, but I was concernedabout aspects of the script which had evolved, and broached the subject withTracy. But unlike before, without hearing me out, Tracy said decisions were nolonger his to make unilaterally. He suggested I speak to him. the director, andproducers as a group, in a conference call. It was late in the process forchanges to be made very easily. I was leery of being taken wrong, of distancinganyone. So I suggested I first write a letter to them, more carefully explainingmy viewpoint:Dear Tracy, Rob, Joe & Tod,I have read the current version of the script and I have a comment that I feelis urgent that you consider.First, so as not to be misunderstood (being misunderstood has been a major themein my life) I want to say enthusiastically that overall this version is great!Much improved over an already absorbing perspective of my experience. I was verymoved by parts that express so well things I have felt. Dana was actuallybrought to tears at the part where I am returned. Neither of us could put itdown. Not just because we're in it, but because it's such a gripping telling ofit that everyone is going react the same way.But I say this with certain qualifiers. Throughout the years of my associationwith Tracy I have consistently expressed my reservations concerning anydepartures from reality my story might take in the process of translation to thescreen. Tracy has given me a number of logical explanations for the necessity ofsuch changes. Not as just so much gratuitous artistic license but as clarifying,condensing devices and as tactics in avoidance of rights problems. Of coursethere are the concerns of keeping it all (wince) commercially appealing. And Ican see and agree that the intrinsic limits of film in communicating detailresult in the need to represent some things not so much documentarily but in abroadly symbolic fashion ... in \"essences\" of reality. I can concede thevalidity of these explanations in principle, only limited by the question ofwhether one of these rationales was actually the reason for any particularchange.Specifically, my central complaint is about what has gradually happened to therepresentation of me in successive versions of the script. It may be possiblefor me to come to terms with a wide variety of omissions or alterations ofactual places or events where warranted by the reasons above. But I find it muchharder to reconcile changes made to the most central characters. I mean, afterall, what is this movie about, if not the people it happened to?The two most persuasive points Tracy used in getting me to agree to grant rightsfor a movie to be made were: (1) he would do his best to stay true to the facts;and (2) I would have an opportunity to become understood, to be seen for what Ireally am, a chance to correct misconceptions that have been publicized aboutme.In earlier versions of the script there were scenes and dialogue that displayedthe more philosophical, thinking side of my personality. I went along withmagnification and focus on some (presently embarrassing) risk-taking acts ofmine because of the counterbalance provided by the \"intellectual side\" scenes.But now, with all the chopping and shuffling involved in rewrites, a criticalfactor has slipped away. Inadvertent though it may have been, in this script Ihave become not much more than a one-dimensional character, a wild,irresponsible risk seeker.It was with some difficulty I managed to open up one night to [Tracy's secretaryand research assistant] Leslie and reveal more to her about how I moved fromPayson where I had the nickname \"the Professor,\" to Snowflake where I was thendetermined to get out of that pigeonhole I had been placed in. I had been called\"mad scientist,\" \"Einstein,\" and such. I was unfairly cast as nothing more thana sensitive goody-goody, a wimpy egghead nerd. So I guess that all that boxing,biker, karate, bull-riding, hell-raising stuff was a struggle of my psyche tobreak out of a prison of other people's perceptions. The irony is that all Isucceeded in doing was moving from one pigeonhole to the next. At least, to mostpeople in this town. Certain teachers saw through it, as well as those who wereclose to me. Polysyllabic vocabulary and lofty references had a way of sometimesslipping out. And at my recent twenty-year high-school reunion the story wasrecounted to the group of how I would never take a book home, cut classes allweek, and come roaring up to school on test day and ace the test. At least nowthey could feel a little amused at the consternation experienced by ourdisapproving, conservative town fathers in viewing this refutation of a majortenet of their ethic. Even this dichotomy of character is an enormousoversimplification of my makeup, but that's okay because after all, this movieisn't exactly a character study.An important consideration from your viewpoint is that, as you know, the betteractors are going to have greater interest in playing a more complex character.Contrasting, contradictory, even paradoxical traits put meat in the part forthem. Audiences, too, prefer more depth. \"One-dimensional clichés\" are commoncriticisms of lesser movies. Obviously, since I'm approving inclusion ofunflattering traits, I shouldn't be accused of seeking to gold-plate mycharacter. I'm just looking for a little more balance and authenticity. Andauthenticity is something that must also be a high priority with you or youwouldn't buy rights to a true story. You'd just invent the entire thing out ofwhole cloth, and there would be no value in beginning the movie with, \"This is atrue story.\"I do not drink. I objected earlier to the scene of my receiving a gift ofalcohol from Dalis and it was removed; now it's back. One of the things he hadagainst me was that I supposedly thought I was too good to drink with him (ordrink like him). You could save this scene by using a different gift, or have meturning around and giving it away, or something like Allen saying, \"I know youdon't drink anymore but with what you've just come through, I thought you coulduse a little something anyway.\" I find this one real difficult to accept as is,especially since some people tried to dismiss my whole experience as analcohol-induced delusion. I was very into healthy eating (considered far-outhere at that time) and so even that scene of me being the one who ordered thebutterscotch-grape twist would be seen by anyone who knows me as 180 degreesoff. One article that came out even tried to paint me as real unconventionalbecause I ate whole-wheat bread! The doughnut scene is a useful story device,but could be changed to agree with reality and not lose a thing.On page 13 there is reference to my not worrying about tomorrow. If it means notworrying in the sense of being confident, it's fine as is. If it means I onlylived for the moment, it's not. I was full of plans, so many that I was oftenaccused of being too focused on the future. My brother (the boxer/bullrider) wasalways saying, \"I'd rather live a day as a lion than a lifetime as a lamb.\" Iwould counter with, \"Why not live so as to have a lifetime as a lion?\" My majorfailing in this area is that I still took that attitude of immortality that washeld by so many of us at that stage of life. So it was not, \"I take risks as ifthere is no tomorrow,\" but more like, \"I can risk because I am certain oftomorrow.\"Speaking of plans, the story device of \"the dream plan\" being a motorcycledealership carries the biker angle too far and isn't based in fact. A better\"dream plan\" might be the infinite-ratio transmission I told Leslie about. Iinvented this thing in high school, and Mike and I talked about forming acompany called \"Transpectrum\" or something like that, to develop and market itto the big auto manufacturers.I'd like to again emphasize that I feel that Tracy's script is well done andthat his ability to capture the likeness of people has been good. It's just thatwhen you see yourself being sort of summed up to the entire world, it's quitereasonable to pay a little extra attention to whether or not that representationresembles you. I doubt that anyone would be any less concerned in this regardthan I am if it were them. Regardless of the extent of Paramount's plans for meto help with promotion, it is inevitable that I will be doing a very greatnumber of interviews concerning the film. It would be very embarrassing to fieldquestions, or do a bunch of disclaiming sorts of explanations about thingsexcluded or included that I feel strongly about. I really want this movie to besomething I can put my wholehearted support behind. Earlier, when Tracy wasresearching with me for material for the scenes depicting my philosophical,intellectual side he asked me for an appropriate title for a book to be used asone of my favorites and asked also for a quotation representative of ideas I wasthen exploring. So I put together a short list of such titles and quotes I wouldlike to offer again as possibilities for use in putting those things back in thescript.I have a few suggestions for where and how these things can fit in in a way thatI think only helps in the original intent.At your earliest convenience I would like to get together in a conference calland discuss this with you.I sincerely hope that you will take a good look at this from my perspective andperhaps be able to understand my concern. I think it is a reasonable request andI offer it in a spirit of cooperation.Sincerely,Travis WaltonI didn’t broach the subject of the abduction sequence because it had been leftout of versions of the script I was given.Tracy received his copy of the letter at the office provided him by Paramount atthe studio. He contacted the others and arranged for our conference call. Overthe next several weeks the conference was postponed three times, then droppedaltogether. The message was relayed that my letter had been read and not toworry, I’d like the end product.This felt like a pat on the head and “Run along now.” I remained deferential andundemanding. There was certainly no reason anyone should listen to me; heck, Iwas only the guy it had happened to. I heard later that in a meeting with theactors and producers, Lieberman quoted my letter and referred to my comment onthe butterscotch-grape twist, rolling his eyes derisively.Nevertheless, I made phone calls and wrote other letters trying to influencecertain minor parts of the script, all to little effect. I grew a littleexasperated. I wrote: “The earliest version of the script said, ‘This is a truestory.' Now it’s become ‘Based on a true story.’ What’s next, ‘Loosely inspiredby a true story’?”I wasn’t trying to make major changes. I knew better than that. I wasn’t tryingto get creative or meddle in anything stylistic, only to set straight factualthings about the way myself and others, my town and the church, were portrayed.Small things from their point of view, big things only from the perspective ofthe people depicted. Most of my requests went unheeded.Tracy Torme had fought valiantly for the integrity of his work. True to myprediction, the director vetoed a fistfight scene, saying no one was ever goingto hit anyone in his films, so the physical tension peaks with a couple ofshoving matches, with cocked fists, punches never thrown. Some of Tracy’sbattles were waged over issues specifically directed at keeping his word withme. I’m very grateful to Tracy, because I know it cost him in his ability tomaintain a working relationship with the others. Eventually it came to pass thatTracy ceased to have any input and no longer visited the set.Toward the end of it, Tracy bowed out of rewrites, citing other commitments.After filming was under way, another writer was brought in to work uncredited)on the script, mostly on minor dialogue changes. The director himself wasresponsible for more departures from reality than anyone else.I felt I’d done all I could. The contract was clear. I had no legal powerwhatsoever to change one word.Not to worry. The story behind Fire in the Sky will ultimately transcend any ofthe vagaries of its interpretation. There was nothing to be gained by pushingfurther, estranging everyone from me. I recalled the opening quote in thescript: “Chance makes a plaything of a man’s life” (Seneca). I thought wryly:“Hollywood makes a plaything of a man’s life” (Cynica).I brooded deeply for a little while, but I thought it all over and resolved, notanother word about how I felt it ought to be. When confronted with theinevitable, it is wisest simply to face reality and change course. From thispoint forward I was going to be a team player and do whatever I could to help.Emotions aside, “Let’s make lemonade.”Paramount Studios. There wasn’t a better place on the planet to make this movie.The studio had held the largest market share over other studios in recent years,the springboard of numerous blockbuster megahits. They shared with a couple ofother studios the services of United Pictures International (UPI), the largestexhibitor (movie theater) distribution network in the world. Owned by theconglomerate Gulf-Western, Paramount Communications is a multimedia company withfar more development capital available today than any other moviemaking entity.Casting the movie was a fascinating process. It was really funny sometimes topicture certain actors as portraying Mike Rogers or me or some of the others. Ifigured there was no way they were going to get anyone very similar to the realpeople. Since these weren’t people whose characters and likenesses were alreadywidely established in the public mind, they were actually free to choose anyonewho’d fit well with the story.I was in for a real surprise. Some of the casting was uncanny in the actors’physical resemblance to the actual persons. Coincidentally, some of thebest-nailed likenesses were of less central characters, for whom, as far as Iknew, they didn’t even have photos or descriptions. There was, however, apassable likeness between the Mike Rogers of 1975 and the actor who ultimatelyplayed him.The actors considered for Fire in the Sky read like a Who’s Who of known namesin Hollywood. It is best not to list names here concerning who was consideredfor what roles, and why they wound up not getting those roles. It certainlywasn’t because I vetoed anyone. I didn’t even try.Very often actors are thought of in terms of their looks or the roles they’veplayed, rather than their ability to project, in conjunction with their naturallook and personality, various emotions and characters. Some actors, howeverintensely appealing and popular, are always really just playing themselves in anew situation. Others astound by their ability to transform themselvescompletely, literally becoming starkly different people, sometimes almostunrecognizable as that actor. On the other hand, very often the former typereceives as much, if not more, adulation as the latter, because people can onlyidentify with an appeal that remains consistent long enough for them to feelthey’ve come to know a personal friend.Naturally I was most keenly interested in who would be chosen to play me. Manypeople fantasize being played by actors who are nothing like them. I think I waspretty realistic on that point. Still, there were actors whose names came upthat I fervently hoped would not be cast, I didn’t care how big their nameswere. My curiosity was not to be soon satisfied; my part was one of the verylast to be cast. Since I wasn’t a regular moviegoer, I wasn’t sufficientlyfamiliar with some of the actors to be able to see how very aptly they’d beencast.Craig Sheffer was cast as Allen Dalis. When it opened, I ran out and saw A RiverRuns Through It, watching to try to see him as Allen. I was very impressed withthe range and subtlety of his performance, but I couldn’t see him as AllenDalis. Was I ever in for a shock. Compare his performance in A River RunsThrough It to that in Fire in the Sky. You’ll be asking yourself, is this eventhe same guy? Same thing with his other films.Craig Sheffer played Allen Dalis in a manner that even Allen is proud of, andjustifiably so. He added nuances and ad-libs that dang near stole his scenes.That parting look and shrug he gave as the other crewmen left the polygraphtests is an example. If some even better parts of his performance had been used,he just might have run off with the whole show.There is always far more film shot for any movie than the audience will eversee. Most movies could be made two, three, or even four times longer than theyend up by using all the footage shot. The extra isn’t error, it’s insurance.Having more raw material gives the editors more range, something to work with tosolve technical problems, and occasionally, to correct story problems. A goodeditor has to be prepared to exclude outstanding scenes if they don’t fit in away that maximizes the progression of the overall story.Conventional wisdom places the optimum length of a movie at 95 to 105 minutes.The question has been extensively researched and measured. People tire, not onlyof sitting, but of responding intensely. Modern life makes people so busy, manypeople can’t budget more time than that. Actually, they’ve found a large percentof the audience believes they would be pleased with just a little greaterlength. But exhibitors (the movie theaters) have a good deal of input into theequations. So the net effect of their tradeoff of overall attendance versus thenumber of showings they can get into a given time span, contributes to pushingback running times.Most people are like me. When they like a movie, they wish there could have beenmore. Which is exactly what moviemakers want. Leave ’em just a little hungry formore, even when a sequel is out of the question, as with Fire in the Sky. Whenthe final credits roll, filmmakers certainly wouldn’t want moviegoers feelingthey’ve had their fill. The most favorable reactions (those which stay withaudiences long enough for them to recommend the movie to friends) are thosewhich keep people thinking about it long after leaving the theater. I noticedmany thoughtful expressions on the faces of people leaving Fire in the Sky.More than forty actors were considered for the part of Sheriff Frank Watters, acomposite character developed to embody the skeptical viewpoint. Among thesewere Gary Busey, Scott Glenn, Peter Strauss, James Caan—even Richard DeanAnderson. I suggested Cliff Robertson.There are many reasons why an actor might end up losing a certain role. The twoobvious reasons—either the actor or casting gives a thumbs-down—are probablyneither one the most frequent. Scheduling conflicts and prior commitments areprobably the biggest reasons. Financial mismatches—in either direction—areprobably second. Salaries must reflect the budget. Some actors often don’t evenlearn they had been considered for a role, aren’t even sent a script, becausecasting eliminates them out-of-hand on the basis of factors they discover early,like unavailability.Talks with James Caan broke off over a number of things, mainly his desire tohave the script rewritten to greatly enlarge the part of Frank Watters. WhenJames Garner was suggested, I was privately a little doubtful. I liked Garner alot, but, to me, that was the problem. He was so enormously well liked Iwondered if audiences would read his character’s embodiment of hostileskepticism too sympathetically. I thought he seemed too kind to be hard, toocuddly to be crusty. I was wrong again. James Garner brought to the roleprecisely the exact mix of hostility and sympathy to convey the essence of ourreal-life situation. Also, his western image and country charm were just rightfor hereabouts. All the lawmen who were combined into his role were pleased toidentify themselves with him.For myself, it went beyond his absolute appropriateness as Watters. I had greatadmiration for his much-publicized gutsy stand against those few in theHollywood establishment who had not given him his financial due from TheRockford Files. His was a moral victory which cleared the way for bettertreatment for others in his profession who lacked his clout. I’m not an actor,but my respect comes from his willingness to undergo huge personal sacrifice andrisk great monetary loss in order to stand on principle. Too few people today doanything purely on principle.I’d heard a lot of impressive names tossed back and forth for the role of MikeRogers: Nicholas Cage, Mark Harmon, Johnny Depp, and Tim Robbins. When RobertPatrick was suggested for an audition, everyone’s reaction was, “Huh?” RobertPatrick’s rendition of the liquid-metal man disguised as a cop, the T-1000, wasindelible. This portrayal of the second terminator opposite ArnoldSchwarzenegger in Terminator II: Judgment Day was so riveting, so coldly,threateningly, precisely convincing, people had trouble envisioning him asanything else. This is one of the mixed blessings to befall new actors whodeliver too powerful a performance in a breakthrough role.The man who showed up at the audition was no slicked-back, lean, fixatedhomicidal cyborg. This guy was fuller, bearded, long-haired, with humanity andcharacter radiating from every pore. He read the emotion-packed scene where Mikeconfronts the congregation (the townsfolk gathered in the church to demand thatlocal officials “do something”) with such intensity and such a wide range ofupwelling feeling that he blew them away. Hollywood types can sometimes getpretty cynical, but that group was genuinely moved. And it was just an audition.They continued to hold readings for the part of Mike Rogers, but from then onthey were just going through the motions. No one said so, but I, always one totry to reserve judgment, was certain Robert Patrick would play Mike Rogers.Robert Patrick didn’t know that—yet—but was nevertheless sufficiently interestedin Fire, out of all the scripts he’d been offered, to pay a visit to Snowflake,Arizona. He was out driving with his wife on vacation and without a word toanyone at Paramount, toured the area—Pinetop, Lakeside. Show Low—and spent anight in town. He obtained my address and cruised by my house while I was outraking my yard. His wife persuaded him it would be too much of an intrusion tostop in, so he didn’t. Drat! I would have loved to have invited him in and takenhim on a tour of the site at Heber, the point of my return, etc.After shooting began I got a phone message to call him on location. I spoke withhim and one or two of the other actors who happened to be in his room. I wasn’tas familiar with their work but they seemed like a great bunch of guys,especially Pete Berg.Robert Patrick was very interested in reality-based research to increase hisunderstanding of the role of Mike Rogers. I answered his questions, which werefull of insight. I put him in touch with Mike. They talked for hours about thework, the town, the incident, and other things directed at filling in the largerblanks in Robert Patrick’s concept of Mike’s character in 1975.I didn’t have clearance to share my copy of the script, so I sat under thecrab-apple tree in my front yard one afternoon and read the entire thing toMike. A real workout for the vocal cords, but I wanted to see his reactions, andto comment myself as we went along.Since Mike hadn’t know the movie was coming, he hadn’t had the gradual educationI'd had about the cinematic facts-of-life and commercial realities of theindustry. The departures from reality the script took hit Mike all at once. Iexplained it to him, but it took a while for him to assimilate. He got much moreupset than I had but, in a few weeks he came around. Time, and talking with me,did it, but talking with Robert Patrick helped a bunch. It wasn’t long before hewas also an enthusiastic supporter of the making of Fire in the Sky.All the guys suggested for the part of Travis Walton had considerable popularityand were big box-office draws. But, although I never once made any outrightdemand, I kept hoping they would come up with somebody who fit my ownself-concept better.It was a hard part to fill. Some of the preliminary filming had already begun,with my part the only one remaining to be cast. I was a little alarmed; therewas a shooting schedule to keep. But the producers didn’t seem overly concerned.Perhaps they knew something I didn’t, perhaps negotiations were under way with anumber of actors.Finally, it was official. I would be played by D. B. Sweeney. My unfamiliaritywith his work was quickly remedied. I rented videos of almost everything he’dever done. He’d starred in The Cutting Edge, Memphis Belle, Eight Men Out,Gardens of Stone, and No Man’s Land. On television he’d played Dish on theEmmy-winning miniseries, Lonesome Dove, and starred in the NBC movie Miss RoseWhite, which won three Emmys in 1992, including Best Made-for-Television Movie.We had a little D. B. Sweeney film festival at my house. I was impressed andrelieved. D. B. Sweeney wasn’t the biggest name of the contenders, but he washands-down my favorite out of those I’d heard mentioned. He didn’t resemble mein appearance and he didn’t match my present sense of myself, but he was perfectfor Fire in the Sky’s take on the Travis Walton of 1975.The movie was being filmed in a place called Oakland, Oregon, population 700.Why there, everyone asks, and not in Snowflake, Arizona? Snowflake and Heberwere the first towns scouted, and the movie trade publication Variety ran anearly article based on press leaks that Fire in the Sky would “lens in Arizona.”So we were definitely considered. Many other Arizona towns were also personallyscouted by the writer and the director. So were Silverton, Colorado, and Paris,Idaho, among others. All were rejected for one reason or another. One town hadsome minor event scheduled that they were decorating for, and which they didn’twant interfered with. And so, in their wisdom, they passed up the enormousfinancial benefits the town would have received. Another town was visuallyright, but too inaccessible in terms of transportation. The logistics of movinggreat numbers of people and equipment back and forth makes having major highwaysand a good-sized airport nearby a major plus. A related factor is sufficientinfrastructure to provide food, housing, entertainment, etc., to several hundredmembers of the cast and crew. Any such shortcomings can be (and have been forother films) overcome with greater budgetary allowances when justifiable. Butanytime it’s possible, finding places already equipped is preferred.Snowflake would have been hard for potential audiences to perceive as heavilyinvolved in forest product-related industries, because it is actually physicallylocated just outside the forest. The producers wanted a town that could sendthis message visually by being surrounded by forest. Snowflake had nearlydoubled in size since 1975, so it was said to be “too grown-up and modern topass for seventeen years ago.” No one said so, but perhaps they also thoughtlocal controversy about the incident might cause problems for the production.Anything a movie can show as background is one less thing to be communicated indialogue. They wanted not just a small town, but a small-town hook. A placewhere Main Street fits into a single camera shot.They ultimately found the answer to those considerations in Oakland, Oregon. Thetown was founded in the mid-1800s by two (fortunate) dropouts from the ill-fatedDonner Party. The original center of Oakland still contains numerous buildingsin excellent condition, built back in the town’s beginnings. I can find inSnowflake a near twin for almost every building in Oakland: the only problem is,these buildings are not adjoining and therefore could not be filmed together asa town with the desired look. Oakland is surrounded by forest resembling thatwhich can be found in our area. Oakland, Oregon, possessed the idyllicsmall-town country charm of 1970s Snowflake the director was searching for.The production’s ground transport could be trucked north directly up the freewayfrom L.A. The nearby city of Roseburg was big enough for a base of operations(lodging, offices, etc.). The airport at Eugene was still a fair drive away, butat least it was freeway all the way.Five weeks of a planned seven-week shoot had elapsed before Dana and I finallygot to go. Seems the director tried, but couldn’t come up with justification torenege on his promises; good old producer Joe Wizan prevailed. We flew up toOregon for a week of visiting the set. It was quite an adventure.When we got off the plane in Eugene we were met by one of Paramount’s drivers, apleasant young fellow who’d emigrated from England during his high-school days.On the seventy-mile drive to our hotel in Roseburg, we chatted about how filminghad been going so far, and about the differences between America and England. Inregard to a passing mention of the word billion, I remarked that a billion isequal to a thousand million here (and in France), while in England and Germanythe term billion denotes a million million. Since he was a transplant with quitea number of years in both countries, I thought such a curiosity would be a safebet for light conversation. One of the painful lessons I’ve learned since 1975is to never share knowledge of little-known facts or surprising oddities withpeople whose beliefs about the incident are uncertain or unknown (and thereforepossibly skeptical). These people regard such statements as confirmation oftheir suspicion that I’m a colossal liar. I could tell he thought I was justindulging in what he diagnosed as my usual fact inventing habit. I shrugged itoff. Nothing new in my being misperceived and misjudged.Even though the area was supposedly in the middle of a drought, the countrysidewas lush and verdant. Trees grew densely, wild berry bushes everywhere. Ourhotel was one of the two best in town, across the highway from each other. Allthe actors and the more important crew members stayed in those two, while othersstayed in some smaller hotels around the area. The director and producers rentedhouses. Perks of the job.When we arrived, there was a gift-wrapped bottle of wine from the crew and awelcome note waiting for us in our room. Though we don’t drink, it was apleasing gesture. The area is a famous wine-growing region, so it made anappropriate souvenir.We’d only been there a few minutes when the phone rang. It was producer JoeWizan. He welcomed us, inquired as to our needs, and told us about the cheeseand wine festival going on over in Oakland. (Filming finished there just in timefor the production designer’s crew to return the town to normal for the annualcelebration. Most of the remainder of the Oregon production would be filmed innearby Sutherlin.) It was Saturday afternoon and production was shut down forthe weekend, Joe told us. He invited us to dinner that evening. He said we’d beon our own for the rest of the weekend to relax, have a look around, and attendthe festival. Joe Wizan was the key person responsible for bringing us to Oregonand a most gracious host throughout our stay.(Joe Wizan knows the business. He is the former president of Twentieth-CenturyFox Studios. Before leaving the studio to form his own company, he presided overthe production of such box-office successes as Alien, the remake of The Fly,Romancing the Stone, Jewel of the Nile, and Cocoon. Wizan’s first independentproduction was Jeremiah Johnson with Robert Redford. He was producer of, in noparticular order, Tough Guys (Kirk Douglas, Burt Lancaster), . . . And JusticeFor All (Al Pacino), Unfaithfully Yours (Dudley Moore. Nastassja Kinski), BestFriends (Goldie Hawn, Burt Reynolds), Two of a Kind (Olivia Newton-John, JohnTravolta), Voices (Amy Irving), Iron Eagles (Lou Gossett, Jr.), Junior Bonner(Steve McQueen), Prime Cut (Lee Marvin, Gene Hackman), and Stop or My Mom WillShoot (Sylvester Stallone), as well as Audrey Rose, Wrestling Ernest Hemingway,HBO’s El Diablo, the Disney Channel’s Perfect Harmony, and Tracy Torme’sSpellbinder. In all he has six television films and over twenty feature films tohis credit. He’s worked with most of the top directors in the business,including Norman Jewison, Michael Ritchie, and Sam Peckinpah. His partner inproduction for Fire in the Sky, Todd Black, worked with him on the production ofa number of the films listed here. Fire in the Sky was the very first film to bepackaged by his newly organized company, Wizan Film Properties.)Before he hung up, Joe told us there were shuttle buses making regular runs tothe Umpqua Valley Wine and Jazz Festival. One of their regular hourly pickuppoints was right outside our hotel.That evening at dinner Joe told us he’d planned to have dinner with the cast inhonor of our visit, but that some of them had needed to make quick trips, backto L.A. and elsewhere, during the weekend break. However, most of the main castmembers would join us for dinner the next day, Sunday evening. Dana and I werethrilled at the prospect.The weather that Sunday morning was beautiful. Since we’d been told filming inOakland was completed, going to the festival would likely be our onlyopportunity to visit the town. The main street shown in the movie was filledwith many colorful tents and booths of the various exhibitors and concessions.The good sense in the director’s choice of Oakland was plain, except for onething: it looks too perfect. I could see why they had to “dress down” thebuildings for the movie. In real life these restored hundred-year-old buildingslook too new. The town hardly looks lived in—just a little too clean, too muchlike some fake 1950s TV soundstage. It was ironic enough that Snowflake didn’tlook enough like Snowflake, but when they found a town that did look enough likeSnowflake, it looked too much like a movie set to look natural in a movie!There was a bandstand set up nearby, where not only jazz, but also groupsplaying other musical styles, entertained. A number of local wineries andcheesemakers offered taste samples. Local artists displayed and offered theirwork for sale. We respected the requests of the Native American artists that wenot photograph them with their work. It was because of a religious belief, wewere told. It was strange to see store chains like Coast-To-Coast, which we wereused to seeing packaged modern-style, housed in such antique buildings.We went to Rae’s Cafe and “the Sheriff's Office” (actually the fire station)where the polygraph tests were filmed. No one recognized us. Everyone wasfriendly, with that small-town openness and sense of community that givesAmerica its underappreciated infrastructure, its backbone. Yes, Oakland couldstand in for our mountain community, no problem.We caught the shuttle bus back to the hotel in plenty of time to rest and getready for our dinner meeting with the cast. We met with Joe Wizan in therestaurant and waited for the others to arrive. They were, naturally,fashionably late to just the right tantalizing degree, but not unpleasantly so.We eventually got together with the rest of the primary cast. However, JamesGarner, Henry Thomas, and Craig Sheffer wouldn’t be coming. The current filmingdidn’t involve these three, so they were elsewhere. Garner was at home; HenryThomas had accompanied his girlfriend back to Los Angeles; Craig Sheffer wasback East somewhere doing promotional work for A River Runs Through It.I don’t know who was most curious—them about us, or us about them—but thatevening is one we’ll always remember. Bradley Gregg, his wife, and a very wellbehaved, red-haired baby son were there. Bradley had appeared with D. B. Sweeneyin Lonesome Dove. Other television-film work included the CBS Hallmark Special,O Pioneers!—starring Jessica Lange. And he was a regular in the TV series TheMarshall Chronicles and My Two Dads. His feature-film work was notable: TheFisher King, Eye of the Storm, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, and Stand byMe. His pleasant wife bore an amazing resemblance to a girl I knew fromSnowflake.Georgia Emelin, who was playing the part of Dana, was one of the first toarrive. They’d said she was beautiful, and they were right. While we were at thefestival she’d spent the morning on a nature hike in nearby Cougar Canyon—alone.Now there’s a lady with independent spirit. She had been chosen partly on thebasis of a credible family resemblance to Mike Rogers; it was therefore nostretch to note features she and Dana held alike. As Joe Wizan had told me,Georgia had a sweetness about her like Dana’s. Not surprisingly, she and Danahit it off right away.Fire in the Sky was Georgia’s motion-picture debut. She’d been born in New York,raised in Colorado and California. She’d played the lead in stage productions ofFifth of July, Rude Awakening, Fractions, and (understandably) Beauty and theBeast. In television she’d made guest appearances in Murder. She Wrote, QuantumLeap, and The Young Riders. She starred in the made-for-television movies Siegeat Alta View, Leap of Faith, Deadly Relations, and the miniseries Common Ground.Peter Berg (who played David Whitlock, a crewman created to replace the reallife crewman from whom movie rights were not obtained) was a real character. Hewas a quick wit who kept everybody laughing. That is. socially. When it comes towork he is a very serious and hardworking actor who puts every bit of himselfinto his role, doing whatever he can to bring out the most in the characters heplays.Pete seemed to be right in the middle of the close camaraderie that developedwithin the cast. That group chemistry was fortunate but very real. Some genuinefriendships were formed during the making of Fire in the Sky. Theyall—especially the guys playing the logging crew—played golf together constantlyduring their off-hours in Oregon. But having played the second buddy in bothFire in the Sky and Aspen Extreme shouldn’t give casting people tunnel visionabout Pete. Because (something he may not know till he reads this) he had beenthe first name on one early list I saw of potential candidates for thelead—number-one buddy Mike Rogers. Peter Berg's other movie credits are: CrookedHearts, Late for Dinner, A Midnight Clear, Race for Glory, Heart of Dixie, Neveron Tuesday, Tehachapi, and, for USA TV, Key Evidence.Scott McDonald played my brothers Don and Duane rolled into one person namedDan. Scott is a likable fellow and did a good job—although he's not asintimidating as my real brothers.It may surprise some that we weren’t so distracted that we didn’t eat ourdinner, but the atmosphere was pretty casual and we thoroughly enjoyed our time.Once more I picked up on the fact that we’d turned out not to be the far-outspecimens they had anticipated meeting. I believe that had been a factor in D.B. Sweeny’s earlier reluctance to make contact by phone. In fact, he later toldme he’d been concerned: What if he met me and then didn't believe me? That wouldhave seriously interfered with his ability to give his all to his performance.Putting myself in his shoes, I could appreciate his thinking.Later, after some of the people conversing started to divide into subgroups,Sweeney called me over, and we sat and talked awhile. He apologized for notgetting in touch sooner, but I told him I understood. I also got a littleinsight into his psyche. His status as a young single actor with a high quotientof appeal to female fans, and with regard to some of his extracurricularactivities, have given him a bit of a wild, bad-boy reputation offscreen. Butthose stories paint a very incomplete picture. He’s a man of far greater depthand intelligence than any of his roles have given him the opportunity todisplay.Sweeney’s frequent casting as characters with roguish, daring qualities may stemfrom some of his offscreen activities. He says he’s lately begun to curb hisnatural instinct to take risks, on and off camera. As he told DramaLogue: “I’mtrying to cut back a little bit, because statistically speaking, I’ve dodged afew bullets. I recently passed on an offer to bungee-jump, but I still want toskydive. I do a lot of scuba diving, and I really enjoy that, but I’m not asreckless as I was. I used to be really reckless—now, I’m just sort of moderatelyadventurous.” . . . Sort of parallels some of the changes I’ve been through.During this whole movie episode I picked up a lot of juicy gossip about thecast, crew, director, producer, etc., but you won’t be hearing any of that here.For that sort of stuff you’ll have to go to the tabloids.The pleasant weather held for our first day on the set at nearby Sutherlin.Buildings there represented the motel, the church, and the homes of my mother,Mike, and the crew. Work on a film begins early. We were surprised at how chillythe mid-September mornings dawned, but wardrobe kindly lent us some jackets.The film crew seemed naturally curious, but didn’t quite know how to react to usat first. But it wasn’t long before I got that old familiar, “Wow, you’re not atall the flake I expected you’d be.” That reaction was also true of a few of theextras, but many of them were very friendly from the start.Right away we met executive producer Wolfgang Glattis, an extremely nice man wedidn’t really get to know well until after our Oregon trip. He had just pickedup breakfast from the food-service wagon that fed everyone on the set (includingall the extras). He invited us to grab something to eat, too. He sent someone totake us over there who, to our embarrassment, put us at the head of a long lineof people waiting there. “Unlike you, they aren’t needed till later,” heexplained, “and they don’t have anything better to do while they wait aroundhere.” After eating our breakfast in the local men’s club, rented to theproduction, we checked out the vehicles used in the movie. Parked out back wasmy motorcycle—or both of them, I should say. In no production paying out costsof around fifteen thousand dollars per minute can only a single item of any keypiece of mechanical equipment appearing on camera be considered sufficient. Theexpense of a schedule delay caused by a few minutes’ mechanical difficulty makespaying for doubles of all the vehicles a very cost-effective insurance.In the case of our crew truck, four identical trucks were readied. Three ofthese were prepared with all-new running gear. Unlike Mike’s real truck,mechanical breakdowns were very unlikely. Every detail was duplicated. All thepapers, tools, and grubby work-gloves that normally cluttered the dash of Mike’swork-truck were duplicated and glued into identical positions. Four sets ofidentical brand-new seat covers were artificially aged with the same assortmentof stains and worn spots. They’d done their homework well, producing veryauthentic work-trucks.Apparently the team who produced the quadruplets and the team who added thefinishing touches were not the same; four trucks with nice, new-white paint jobshad been the starting material, but identical dents, scrapes, and battle scarshad been added. What appeared even at close range to be dust, mud splashes,scraped-off paint, and even gasoline drip stains under the tank-filler cap wereall, upon very close inspection, actually paint or lumps of plastic applied overthe underneath coat. It was amazingly authentic—insurance that the matcheswouldn’t be ruined, rubbing off with contact with clothing or washing off in therain.One of the trucks was built without any engine or running gear at all. It wasspecially prepared for the cab to be split apart right between the front andback seats. It had special brackets to attach steel casters underneath tosupport the unwheeled ends of the halves after they were separated. The wholething could be put back together with bolts.No, this wasn’t done for some bizarre special effect depicting a crash, laserblast, or such. It was simply a way to allow access for a large cluster ofcamera, crew, and soundman to film toward the back seat from the point of viewof those in the front seat and vice versa—to allow filming of the view from theback seat and over the shoulders of those in the front seat. The latter was donemostly with stand-in doubles for the actors. The dash lights were operable andthe speedometer was rigged to read speed. Road movement was simulated by rockingthe truck.In order for the driver to move the steering wheel in a free and natural way, asif the truck were actually moving, the steering wheel was disconnected from thefront wheels. This made the front half difficult to maneuver when it was off thetrailer. For night scenes there was no need for a darkened building, or to waitfor night. A special lightproof black tent was quickly framed up and placed overthe whole unit—truck, dollies, film and sound equipment, and operators.The black-tent trick was also used to cover the exterior doors and windows ofbuildings used in interior nighttime filming, as in the motel office scene. Butfor exterior night shots, real, 100-percent-natural, unadulterated night wasemployed. The same thing with the scenes out on the contract—real trees, realchainsaws.These were some of the first scenes shot in Oregon. Local loggers were hired totrain the actors playing the crew of woodsmen. They were taught how to handlechainsaws, how to fell trees. They discovered that felling a tree accurately isno simple thing. Robert Patrick related an amusing incident, when he wassupposed to fell a tree on a particular spot, and wound up sending a film crewscrambling in all directions when the tree didn’t—as they say in director’slingo—“hit its mark.”It was a good thing the forest scenes up on Boomer Hill were shot first becausethey were some of the most difficult. The weather held on to the last of thesummer heat. The steep, narrow, mountain dirt-road up to the set was the onlyway in or out. Big trucks of equipment and supplies went back and forth withbarely room to get by each other, dust boiling up and reducing visibility to afew feet ahead. It was a nightmare of logistics because everything had to bebrought in, including toilets. Anything not on-hand would take hours to get.People often got lost trying to find the place. Tempers grew short. There were anumber of incidents. Some strained working relationships never recovered. On topof this, much of the footage was filmed at night.The crew gave me some of the Fire in the Sky hats they had made up, with \"BoomerHill Gang” added to the front, and, on the back, “Boned again, again and again.”I was told to be glad I’d missed that time on the set, but I still wished Icould have visited then.The set in Sutherlin consisted of several streets barricaded with orange trafficcones. This one small area was wisely chosen so as to put everything to befilmed within convenient distance. Uniformed local off-duty police hired by theproduction as security officers kept throngs of fans and local sightseers behindyellow plastic ribbon strung up around the perimeter.The men’s lodge and its adjacent vacant lot (now filled with trailers) served asbase of operations. Wardrobe was across the street from that, with the churchnext door. The “Chaparral Motel” was on the street behind, while its manager’soffice was actually mocked up in someone’s carport on another street a blockaway, across from the church. Residences used in the movie were on nearby sidestreets.The first scene we saw filmed was that of “Mike Rogers” leaving his motel roomas he and David Whitlock are ambushed by a television news team. Dozens ofpeople standing around displayed great discipline when the call “Stand by toroll!” went up. People standing on crunchy gravel simply froze for many minutesat a time. You could have heard a pin drop. The rest of the signal ritual was abit different from what I’d seen in movies about movies being made, but stillended with “Action!” The director, Rob Lieberman, busy and stressed-out as hewas, took time to welcome us with cold drinks from his personal cooler,explained a few things, and let us sit in his chair and watch the scenes unfoldjust as the camera saw them. The modern equipment they were using had a dualvideo-monitor setup so that the director could sit apart from two separatecameras and see exactly what each camera is filming.Pete Berg as David Whitlock was waiting for “Mike” (Robert Patrick) on the porchoutside his motel room. When Mike comes out, shaking sleep off, the reportersrush him; Mike snaps back at them and David Whitlock throws out a few defensive,defiant remarks; then they drive off. Pete Berg is so ambitious in trying tofill out his role’s full potential that sometimes he works too hard, getting offhis mark and into shots not planned to involve him.In one take of this scene, the director yelled “Cut!” and everyone looked ateach other, as if to say, “I didn't see any problem, what went wrong with thatone?” Rob Leiberman said, good-naturedly, “I don’t remember David Whitlockhaving that many lines in this scene!” Everybody laughed. The director was oneof those wise enough to tolerate actors ad-libbing lines, because some very goodones came through in the final product.Also filmed outside “Mike’s motel room” was a scene where a couple of Japanesereporters (among the various foreign journalists who descended on Snowflake)walk by chattering in their native language. What most of the audience wasunaware of, since it was not translated with subtitles, was that they jokedabout the availability of a sushi bar in a place like Snowflake. We had a nicetalk with those two actors, one of whom had been a samurai in the Ninja Turtlesmovie.To the regulars on a movie set it’s supposed to be very boring, all the waitingand repetition. But it was all so new to us, everything was continuallyexciting. We met a lot of nice people. The crowds hanging around on the otherside of the yellow tape barriers didn’t seem to tire of waiting for a chance toglimpse a celebrity, get an autograph or maybe even get to take a picture withone of the stars.We were also the targets of attention, after they found out who we were, whichevoked a kind of “Who, me?” reaction from us. There was a verystabilizing—though not intended as such—reminder from a kid who, after he gotour autograph, asked, “Are you guys anybody?” We loved it. Nothing like aguileless youngster to help you keep things in perspective.The extras (people without lines hired to be crowds, passersby, etc.) were areally great bunch. There were some great people on the crew, too. HankGarfield, the sound mixer, told me about an article about Fire in the Sky in theHollywood Reporter (a movie-industry trade publication) and, when I expressedcuriosity about it, promised to let me see his copy, which he hadn’t broughtwith him. I’ve had many such promises from people I’ve met in connection withthe incident, and never gave it another thought.Much to my surprise, days later, our driver delivered Hank’s copy of thepublication to us as we left. I was impressed by things like that. It’s easy tobe nice to someone’s face and then forget it. It really means something whensomeone remembers and goes out of his way to keep his word later.The crowds really gathered when Robert Patrick appeared. Everyone wanted to seethe T-1000 from Terminator II. He was very good natured about it and didn’t mindgiving a few minutes to the people who ultimately pay to put stars where theyare. That rascal D. B. Sweeney didn’t care much for contact with his fans, buthe sure had a different gorgeous lady on his arm each time I saw him. RobertPatrick’s wife, also an actress, wasn’t on the set, but he kept a big picture ofher prominently displayed in his trailer.A lady who owned a local card-and-memorabilia shop had Robert Patrick signingcards for her. When Dana expressed eagerness to get a few of those TerminatorII: Judgment Day trading cards for our kids, Robert Patrick bought, out of hisown pocket, a whole case from the shop owner, and sat down and autographed everyone of them for us. That sort of kindness has real meaning.I had thought Robert Patrick and D. B. Sweeney drew a big crowd until JamesGarner finally showed up on the set. That man can pull in a crowd—and from everyage group. Here again was somebody who didn’t merely understand who buttered hisbread, but seemed to have a genuine liking for his fans. There was nothingself-centered about him.One incident illustrating that fact to me occurred as a group of people crowdedaround James Garner on the second landing of the high steps to the church,listening to him tell an interesting story. He was seated comfortably in hisspecial western-style chair, a gift presented to him years past. It was adirector’s-style folding chair of hand-tooled leather, with saddlebags engravedwith his initials, and padded with sheep’s wool. In the midst of all thatcomfort and attention, James Garner abruptly got up and waded through the crowdto assist a frail old man. The elderly gentleman was over ninety, an extra inthe church scene, unsteadily trying to make his way down the long, steepstairway. No one else had even noticed. People leaned obliviously against bothhandrails, so the old fellow had nothing with which to steady himself. But JamesGarner, no self-absorbed star basking in the admiration of his fans, was theonly person to come to the rescue. This was only one of several incidents Iobserved that demonstrated his sensitivity to the needs of others around him asa natural part of his personality.Yes, I did run into one or two of those archetypal insecure, ego-driven,spoiled-brat prima donnas, but I was surprised at how few “Hollywood types” Iencountered on the set of Fire in the Sky. I know plenty exist, but I ran intomore of them incarnated as production office people than as actors.There was unusually fine casting, just about perfect, for Fire in the Sky. Thechemistry of that group was phenomenal, on and off camera. All those upcomingyoung actors on the logging crew looked upon James Garner as a mentor, from whomthey learned much. About golf, too! Sweeney says Garner kicked their greenhorntails out on the golf course.I don’t want anyone to think I’m fawning over or being ingratiating about thesepeople. I don’t think I was very starstruck at all. Most people think I’m just alittle bit cynical in my judgment of others (as if events in my life hadn’tencouraged worse!). I pride myself on looking past exteriors and superficialjudgments, because I’ve too often been a victim of such bias. I really believethat cast was an unusually decent bunch. I’ve run into a number of celebritiesover the years with whom I was not so impressed. It is amazing to find such goodpeople surviving among the sharks and jealous mega-egos of that business. Whatquality could they possess to permit that survival? Talent. The beasts won’tdevour those golden geese because they need them.I did an interview while I was there with Doug Lewellyn, the “People’s Court”commentator, who also does “The Making of . . .” videos for different movies.After we went back out into the street, he was engaged in some other filming ofthe goings-on, when he came over and asked one last question as an afterthought:“Look at all this commotion going on here, all those people asking for yourautograph, all these actors, crew, equipment. All this is on account of you. Howdoes that make you feel?”I shrugged and without thinking gave some half-intelligible answer which didn’tfully express what I felt. I could tell he couldn’t believe anyone wouldn’t bestarstruck by all that. What I wanted to say is that basically, it’s a wash. Idon’t regard as positive all aspects of my movie experience, even those mostpeople would so regard. It would take one hell of a lot of positive tocounterbalance all the negative I’d lived through for so many years. Also, thesame philosophy which insulated me from the negative insulates me from theso-called “positive” attention. The shell that protects an animal also preventsits feeling being petted. On both extremes, it only stems from the ideas thatpeople who don’t know the real me hold in their minds. I had to face it. Thefacts are what they are. An inaccurate perception, whether positive or negative,must be disregarded. If one is irrelevant, then so is the other.Dana and I were going to get to watch the filming of one of the more emotionallyintense scenes of the movie, in which Mike Rogers confronts those assembled fora town meeting concerning the incident. In fact, we were going to be in it.Golly gee, this was going to be my big break into instant superstardom! JoeWizan’s idea was to have us in the crowd, verbally attacking “Mike” withsuspicions of foul play. When someone called out in an accusing tone, “Well,then, where is he?” I was to stand up and say with heavy suspicion: “Yeah, Mike,where is Travis!?” A nice ironic twist for a cameo appearance.Getting a speaking line required me to join SAG, the Screen Actors Guild union.We had to go to wardrobe for mid-seventies garb, and Dana had to go to themakeup trailer to have her normally full curls combed down into a styleappropriate for the time. She felt really funny wearing bell bottoms again.We sat there in the crowd all day for two days. Periodically the smoke machinewould pump in some more (cough) “atmosphere.” There was a light rain the firstafternoon and second morning. But rain or shine, early or late, it was always asunny afternoon inside the church. Thanks to the stained glass, sunshine waseasy to simulate by setting up powerful lights outside each of the west windows.“Sunlight” streamed in at the same angle throughout shooting.Robert Patrick’s performance was incredibly powerful. When he confronted andchastised the people for their behavior, his words were so intense, his emotionsso strong and real, that the roomful of extras didn’t have to act. Everyone wasvisibly affected and many said they actually felt ashamed of what they’d “done.”Me too. It was amazing. Several of the women, Dana included, were actually movedto tears. No wonder he blew them away with his audition of this scene.There was take after take. Again, they weren’t mistakes. The director wantedmany angles on this one, as well as different intensities. Time after timeRobert Patrick went out and came back in and delivered another torrent of variedemotions.Without pause he had to run the gamut of had-it-up-to-here,can’t-take-it-anymore anger. Then a fervent rupturing of overflowing sadness,dismay, anger, and disappointment at betrayal. And finally he had to shiftquickly to a defiant challenge. Each time, he shook with anger, poured outtears, and then hardened into steely, straightforward defiance.From where was he dredging this incredible energy? He literally stunned thecrowd. One thing he shattered permanently was his typecasting as a bloodless,unfeeling cyborg. Most people wouldn’t recognize him in person from his previousrole anyway. But to see him as Mike Rogers playing with his laughing littledaughters, forever evaporates the knee-jerk tendency to see in him a sinisterair of hidden menace (although he can still do that as no one else can).I did quite a number of takes of my little spoken line, too. Only, myrepetitions probably were due to not getting it right, because the directorordered the line cut from the movie very early in the editing process.Inexplicably, the director picked one of Robert Patrick’s milder renditions ofthat scene. A lot of Robert Patrick’s best stuff, as with the other actors, wascut out. But for the actors the cuts were for technical reasons like pacing,context, to keep the length within limits, or merely the director’s artisticpreference; my bit was chopped so early, it must have been pretty bad.However, there’s a positive way of looking at my part being cut. Every one ofthe actors was moved from a somewhat skeptical attitude about the incident, to amuch more believing position after meeting and speaking with me. Actors areprofessional simulators of reality and therefore, it seems, would be much morecapable of detecting “acting” (lying, if you will) than the average person.Juxtapose this with my failure to act well enough to win even a tiny spot in myown movie. Together those facts should say quite a bit for my credibility, ifnothing for my thespian talents.Peter Berg’s big moment in Fire in the Sky, from an actor’s viewpoint, was whenhe finally had a long, intense scene, alone on camera and in close-up, when hegoes to the deserted church and prays for forgiveness—forgiveness for failing toattempt an immediate rescue of me, not for having committed my murder, but theaudience is supposed to be left wondering.Peter Berg’s buddies, Robert Patrick and D. B. Sweeney, got together with thedirector and planned a practical joke. Pete was about to get his comeuppance forhis earlier scene-stealing. The director went through a number of takes as usualto make sure Pete’s best was in the can (and it was very good, intense emotion;they could have used more of it, had there been time).I stood back in the corner with my video camera and taped the whole thing. Whenthey were sure they had his performance, the director told him he needed onemore take. As with the previous takes, this shot would begin with the camera onthe stained-glass window in the rear. The camera would back down the aisle totake in the front of the first pew, where it would then pan over to Peter Berg,facing forward, praying aloud while the camera came in for a close-up. Only thistime, at a prearranged signal, Robert and D.B., whom Pete believed had lefthours ago, came up from the rear stairwell and followed the Steadicam down theaisle, slipping quietly into the pew behind Peter Berg. As the camera came in onPeter Berg for what was supposed to be his solo close-up, there on either sideof his face were the mugging faces of Robert and D.B., leaning forward intoframe, stealing his scene!As the shot ended the guys behind sniggered a little to let Pete know he wasn’talone. When he turned and saw them, everyone roared with laughter. In spite ofbeing wrung-out from his earlier outpouring, Pete took it well. He joked thatsince they’d intruded on his best take, it would be necessary to get those twomatted out of that scene so it still could be used.I have a prediction. Watch those three, because I believe they are really goingsomewhere in their profession.It was a pleasure meeting Henry Thomas, who played Greg Hayes, another crewmancharacter created in absence of contracts with all real life crew members. Partof the reason he was cast was because of his prior role in the blockbusterE.T.—The ExtraTerrestrial. That fact had the unintended effect of inviting someunwarranted comparisons between E.T. and Fire in the Sky. Henry Thomas, likemany actors in his situation, has had his own share of difficulty getting peopleto see him as someone other than the child Elliot from E.T. Those people oughtto go back and look again at E.T. Thomas delivered an amazing performance whichcovered the gamut of human expression. Further proof of his range is evident inhis other, more recent work, such as the teenage Norman Bates in Psycho IV.A great source of humor and camaraderie was Noble Willingham, who played SheriffBlake Davis. He kept everybody in stitches, as with his difficulty inpronouncing “Mogollon” on camera.It was great meeting the director’s wife, Marilu Henner, Best known for her workon two hit series, Taxi and Evening Shade, and for the film L.A. Story. I sawher on a television news-magazine during the time Fire in the Sky was inproduction. She is a really talented dancer, amazingly fit. My wife Dana, whoteaches aerobics at our local college, shares her interest in dance andaerobics. Dana was delighted when Marilu presented her with a copy of MariluHenner’s Dancerobics, her exercise video.We attended “dailies,” which is the screening of “rushes,” film just back fromspecial processing in L.A. Even this raw, uncut footage without music wasimpressive. We also spent some time in the editing room with Steve Mirkovich,who kindly gave us a quick overview of the process and showed us how he hadmatched one segment with a specially prepared trial soundtrack. Fascinatingwork. Our on-location driver, Pete Kozak who was also Robert Patrick’s driver,was a really interesting person. He is a brother of actress Harley Kozak. Idon’t know what he was doing working as a driver, because the guy has brain andtalent. I noticed that during the periods he spent waiting around, he wasreading some pretty heavy intellectual books. He also would play his guitar ormandolin. When his mandolin was stolen, the cast got together and bought him anew one.I’d heard he’d written a song called “Fire in the Sky.” As we were preparing toleave we finally had a chance to hear it. I videotaped Kozac’s impromptuperformance while our first driver, the young English fellow, who made thelonger hauls to Eugene, wrung his hands and checked his watch. It was his job tomake sure he got us to our plane on time. We’d stopped off in Oakland, where thefilm company had gone back for one last scene at Rae’s Cafe. Peter Berg wasthere listening to the song with us while he waited for his call.“FIRE IN THE SKY”by Pete KozakLet there be lightnin’Let there be thunderLet the heavens rage on high.What is this thing burnin ’ through the darkness?Just a fire in the sky.Out on the backroadsHigh in the timberHardworkin’ man, just gettin’ by.Then somethin’ changed my life forever—Just a fire in the sky.I saw what I sawJust can’t explain itDon’t you think I haven’t tried?But who’d take the word of anybodyWho speaks of fire in the sky?It seems my peopleThey don’t know meThey turn away when I pass by.Yet anymore I ain't too sure of nothin’But that fire in the sky.Flames of damnation, saith the preacher,Consume the wicked when they die.What saith thou, Preacher,Where on earth was the wickedIn that fire in the sky?I'm not dreamin’ and I'm not crazyI can look you in the eyeThen swear as God almighty is my witnessBeen rainin’ fire in the sky, fire in the sky, fire in the sky. . .His lyrics had depth and revealed a perceptiveness and understanding of some ofthe subtleties of the script. But this mere transcript of his lyrics can’tconvey the feeling his voice and his music created. We were really moved. Itried unsuccessfully to get people interested in using the song in the movie.I’d still like to get someone interested in signing Pete Kozak to record it.Maybe it’s just me, but it seems there’s been an unusual amount of irony andcoincidence in connection with my experience. One of my first televisionappearances was with Leonard Nimoy, on a show produced by David Wolper, who isgrandfather to one of Dana’s cousins. The official still photographer on the setwas Greg Schwartz, who is the son-in-law of—Leonard Nimoy.Georgia Emelin has some friends who used to live in Snowflake. Working in thetown where the movie was shot, thousands of miles from Snowflake, is formerSnowflake sheriff Marlin Gillespie’s oldest son. One of the extras, the localfire chief, bore a striking resemblance to former Snowflake town marshal SanfordFlake, and the chief has friends he had recently visited in Snowflake.In the film, the doughnut girl’s mom is played by a local woman named NancyNeifert who turned out to be a second cousin of mine who I’d never met! She justhappened to be living where the movie was being made and had signed on as anextra without even connecting the movie to stories she’d heard about me throughrelatives. Months later, when I finally got time to make a call to verify thisfamily connection, her father, my great-uncle Oakly Rogers, answered the phone.He’d ordered a book about his family’s genealogy that very day. My grandmother’smaiden name was Rogers. Who knows, maybe Mike is my tenth cousin or something.The incident happened on November 5, 1975—which was Robert Patrick’s seventeenthbirthday! Seventeen years later he took on the role of Mike Rogers. Inresearching his role, Robert Patrick discovered he had relatives from Snowflake.Then he learned that he is related to Mike and Dana! Robert Patrick’s cousin ismarried to Tony Willis, the grandson of Mike and Dana’s great-aunt (and, likethem, a descendant of more than one of Snowflake’s founding families). Mike’sgrandmother is a sister of Tony’s grandmother, and on top of that, Mike’sgrandfather is a cousin to Tony’s grandfather. Which, I’m told, makes themdouble cousins.One Snowflake resident received an article about the making of the movie (whichI’d not yet announced locally) from a relative who lived in . . . tiny Oakland,Oregon. Rob Lieberman directed James Earl Jones in over twenty episodes of“Gabriel’s Fire” (that fire word again). James Earl Jones (also the voice ofDarth Vader in Star Wars) narrated a television documentary of my experience. Healso played the part of Barney, husband of Betty Hill, the couple whose famousUFO-abduction case was depicted in the 1975 NBC television-movie The UFOIncident. Jones also worked with Robert Patrick’s T2 costar, ArnoldSchwarzenegger, in Conan the Barbarian. During the making of Fire in the Sky, ameteorite struck in a ravine near Oakland, only the fifth recovered meteorite inOregon’s history. Just after the release of Fire in the Sky, Bruce Lee’s sonBrandon died tragically on a Paramount set, an incident surrounded by bizarreparallels with his father’s death that are too numerous to list.As interesting as these ironies and coincidences are, it is illogical to attachundue significance to coincidence. Aristotle expressed this best when he said,“It is inevitable that the unusual will sometimes occur. ” Indeed it will.In late October we left to visit the special-effects studio, Industrial Lightand Magic, located in San Rafael, just north of San Francisco. (Again, over thedirector’s druthers.) Mike Rogers was completely over his problem with thescript, so he was going with us. He’d been in touch with Robert Patrick often,which had built up a lot of his enthusiasm for the project.Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) is the brainchild of film genius George Lucas.There’s no monolithic sign saying This is the spot. In fact, the sign doesn’tsay ILM at all—only a business name, which I won’t reveal here, that doesn’tremotely suggest what goes on inside.We arrived at just the right time to see the filming of some of the scenes whereI’m held down on the table inside the UFO. In spite of the differences from whatactually had happened, that was very unsettling to watch. It was interesting,but it was the least enjoyable part of our two-day visit.Most everything happening at Industrial Light and Magic is secret, at least atfirst, either to maintain proprietary techniques so competitors won't copy them,or to prevent unscrupulous reporters from spoiling the magic for moviegoers. Wehad a couple of little tours of areas of the complex which had created differenteffects for Fire in the Sky. (The effects for Jurassic Park were being donethere while Fire in the Sky was being done, but we weren't supposed to see anyof that, so here I’ll say we didn’t.) Fire in the Sky’s visual effectscoordinator, Molly Naughton, was our guide on the first tour. We were supposedto stay together and only go where she took us. We took pictures only withpermission. On our second tour, with Nilo Rodis-Jamero, we didn’t use ourcameras at all because it seemed to make our hosts uncomfortable.Nilo Rodis-Jamero was credited as coproducer on Fire in the Sky because theexecution of the visual look in the special-effects segment was so much his owncontribution. Nilo was FX art director or designer on some of the most visuallystunning, and successful, movies of all time, including The Empire Strikes Back,Return of the Jedi, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Poltergeist, and Star Trek III, V,and VI.Rodis-Jamero’s work is phenomenal and not confined to flights of fancy. His worklooks good because there’s an underlying practical sense to it. He’s designedproducts for Oakley, the California sports-gear manufacturing company best knownfor sunglasses. He’s designed beyond achieving a \"look” in creating things asdiverse as tactical fighter-pilot helmets, heavy military tanks, andautomobiles, for companies ranging from General Motors to Lucasfilms. He’s madefilm-industry innovations, from editing machines to a variety of specialfilm-effect techniques. Nilo is one of those rare people who is so intelligent,yet so centered in his personality, that he gives off an aura of openness andcalm. He is a very unusual personality—a little mysterious, but very pleasant tobe around.The work being done for Fire in the Sky would have been intriguing even if wehadn’t had a personal interest. There were some amazingly clever techniques; afew were a bit technical for us. We agreed not to reveal what we’d seen, or evendevelop our photos until after the movie had opened. I’ve kept that promise, buteven now I don’t feel it would be constructive to reveal those things or includethose photos here. After all, some people haven’t seen the movie yet.We went into the editing room where Steve Mirkovich was working. We got to seesome rushes of a couple of segments from the special-effects shots. He put onewith a temporary soundtrack from another movie, a space thriller, that reallychurned me up to watch. As in Oregon, he was generous in his willingness toexplain things and not “talk down” to us. (His other films include Cool World,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II, Flight of the Intruder, Flashback, Prince ofDarkness, and Big Trouble in Little China)We got to say hello to D.B. again (and meet his new girl), but we didn’t want tobother him too much while he was between such difficult scenes. The scenesaboard the craft are some of the most intense of the entire movie. Mike met himfor the first time. It was the first time he’d met any of those people, Nilo,Rob Lieberman, Wolfgang Glottis, or the ILM crew. He got to see one of hisduplicated work-trucks there, which was quite a novelty for him.Back home, we endured a lot of suspense while they spent weeks finishing up thesoundtrack, the music, the editing, and the promotional trailers for the movie.Then came the new polygraph tests. The results created a pronounced reaction outin California. They hadn’t expected the tests, but were delighted at theirpublicity value.The next big events for us were the television shows and publications like HardCopy, Sightings, Entertainment Tonight, and USA Today, who sent camera crews andreporters to Snowflake. I don’t think that, prior to our appearances on thoseshows, Paramount had been planning to use us nearly as much as they did. But ourroles in promotion grew to become a tour after they saw how well we handled it.Surprisingly, in many instances journalists displayed more interest in speakingwith us than with production people, or even the actors.The previous years had prepared me somewhat for interviews and handlingsituations with the media. But as intense as it had been back then, when it wasall new to me, it had never been so grueling. What in the world was I doing? Inthe past, single interviews had left me wrung out. What effect would such totalimmersion have on me? Would it soon make the topic completely intolerable forme, or would it have a cathartic effect, mercifully desensitizing me?I gave literally hundreds of interviews. Print, radio, television—back-to-back,all day long. Part of the tour overlapped the Academy Awards. The streets ofL.A. were bumper-to-bumper limos, and our hotel (strangely, located at theintersection of streets bearing the names of my first son and the place inArizona where our outdoor wedding had been held) was host to a slew ofcelebrities. Shock-talk host Howard Stern was broadcasting from the lobby, butfortunately we managed to avoid him.Our schedule was pretty tightly packed. One morning, by satellite uplink I gaveover fifty separate television interviews without moving from my chair. Lookingat a couple of those pieces later, I didn’t realize I’d been so tired: I lookeddownright groggy in one clip. Never once did anyone at Paramount publicity evercoach me or try to influence anything I said in interviews. They were veryhands-off in that respect, but very supportive in taking care of us and keepingus informed as to our schedule, and getting us places on time.Although many misconceptions about our experience survived due to my longsilence, time had thinned out many of the false charges. And in fact. our mediaexperience, the new polygraph tests, and the making of a movie about theincident all contributed to creating an entirely new attitude on the part ofthose from the media. Although there was understandably still skepticism, it wasmostly of the healthy variety.Even after traveling all over the world doing promotional work for the movie,one of the worst hatchet jobs was done right here near home, by Dewey Webb ofthe Phoenix tabloid New Times, a paper so bad they have to give it away and getby on advertising dollars alone. They rely heavily on outrageous, “shock effect”articles.Dewey misrepresented his intentions to get me to cooperate, and pretending thathe would be objective employed all the photographic tricks I’d sit still for.More “monster lighting”: an up-close, fish-eye effect was apparent in thepicture of me that hit the stands. While the photographer kept me busy, Webb hadtaken it upon himself, uninvited, to go through papers on my mantel, which ofcourse revealed nothing except what sort of people I’d—trustingly—allowed intomy home. The folder there contained nothing but Paramount’s standard press kit.Dewey Webb wrote one falsehood after another, even when he was in possession ofdocumented evidence to the contrary. I’d given him some documents he ignored,and Mike Rogers gave him information in a telephone conversation (during whichWebb lied further about his intentions, making promises he broke resoundingly).Some of his false claims were simply parroting of the debunker nonsense, butsome he came up with all on his own.He was so careless with the facts that he wrote one sentence in which myexperience was seven days long at the beginning and five days long at the end:“In the early-morning hours of November 12, seven days later, the dazed,hyperspaced hitchhiker staggered out of the woods near Heber and straight intoUFO immortality with a fantastic tale of how he’d been used as an intergalacticguinea pig during a five-day game of ‘Doctor.’ ” (I was returned on November 10,which by everyone else’s arithmetic adds up to five days. By November 12 I hadalready been in Phoenix for more than a day.) He also falsely claimed the crew’spolygraph tests had been sponsored by the National Enquirer, instead of by thestate police.Then Webb spiced up his piece with quotes from an unnamed “source” heacknowledged he found swigging beer on a local barstool. New Times?—or WeeklyWorld News?I imagine Webb thinks his vicious mockery was marvelously clever and funny. Isensed his intentions and made inquiries after the interview, inquiries whichWebb distorted in his report. I’m not so humorless about the incident and itsramifications as he portrayed me, but my hunch about his concealed intent wasborne out.Probably the most fun of the shows I was on was the Geraldo show. I’danticipated it would be one of the worst, but it wasn’t. Robert Patrick and D.B. Sweeney appeared with Mike and me. D.B. had a practical joke planned. When hewas asked if he thought we were kooks, he said: “I don’t know, I can’t really beobjective about this”—as he brought his hand out of his pocket, wearing a rubberHalloween “alien” hand which he placed nonchalantly across my shoulders. Theaudience roared with laughter.I have no problem with a little good-natured humor. D.B. had had to settle foran alien pat on the back when he was unable to locate a chainsaw anywhere in NewYork City. His original scheme had involved cutting a chair in half, so it’sjust as well that the lack of forest work in the area made chainsaws rare.The final show of the domestic publicity tour was Larry King Live with MikeRogers and myself, Larry King and . . . our number-one detractor, PJK. It airedthe night our movie opened. For the first time we would appear on live nationaltelevision with a particular critic famous for his false reasoning,filibustering, and unfair tactics. We still didn’t actually meet him because hewas brought in via monitor from elsewhere in the studio; we didn’t even speakdirectly to him for the most part.Our vindication was almost anticlimactic in its ease. We made a number of verygood points; PJK, the “debunker,” made none, succeeding only in giving someprime examples of the acute irrationality of his arguments. The highlight of theevening was when, displaying his ineffectual frustration, the “debunker”completely lost control and shouted a snarling epithet, taking the Lord’s namein vain in front of millions on live national television. Our victory was socomplete we were astounded.Ever since that night people have come up to us, called, and written to usconcerning that show. Everyone, even people who usually have no comment, feltstrongly that we had come off very well and that PJK had made himself lookincredibly bad. The way people reacted, you’d think Luke Skywalker had justvanquished the Emperor. And what irony of timing and place!—the night of therelease of Fire in the Sky. And on PJK’s home turf, Washington, D.C. That was atriumph we’ll savor for a long, long time.It was more than the night of the theatrical debut of Fire in the Sky—it was thestart of the Blizzard of ’93, the snowstorm of the century. As we left the CNNstudios the first few flakes fell. It snowed more, and more, and more.We were supposed to fly out the next morning, but it was not to be. Washington,D.C., seldom gets much snow, and wasn’t prepared to remove snow on such a scale.Only one runway at Dulles International Airport was open. We boarded and sat onthe plane for nearly two hours before everyone had to get off, get their ticketsback, and leave. The next day we went back to Dulles and again boarded. Again wewaited for hours and again we had to get off, get our tickets back, and leave.Many of those trying to make connecting flights spent some crowded nights in theairport. On the third day we tried again and made it. At last we were in theair.The promotional tour had taken a grueling few weeks, but we were finally headedhome. The next available flight for the final leg of our flight home wouldn’thave left until the following morning. This would have required staying over inPhoenix, so it saved us another night’s hotel bill and got us home sooner to bedriven the rest of the way. The four of us—Dana and I, and Mike and his lady,Bernadette—were driven back to the Show Low airport in a limousine. The car ranover something in the road and had a blowout ten miles later; fortunately, afterwe had emerged from the steep, winding Salt River Canyon. To top it off, therewas no lug wrench in the car. Mike caught a ride into town to get a wrench.Meanwhile, someone with a wrench finally stopped and we got the spare on and metMike on his return trip. After the weather delays and whatnot, it certainly feltgood when we finally got home that night.Snow in record amounts had virtually locked up the eastern third of the UnitedStates. Dealing with the snow occupied the free time of nearly everyone in theaffected region, a high percentage of the country’s major population centers.Who was going to think about seeing a movie in what was practically a state ofemergency?As it turned out, one heck of a lot of people. Without that storm, conservativeestimates are that Fire in the Sky would have easily topped $ 10 million for itsopening weekend. As it was, it made a respectable $6.4 million that weekend,which made it the number-one movie in the nation. (Fire in the Sky remained inthe top ten for three weeks.) Fire beats ice, match.Of course, the tour and the movie brought a renewed barrage of media andpersonal contact, calls from various celebrities—a comedian, a basketball star,even a near brush with Charlton Heston—and many, many well-wishers. But by thenI was ready to move to some mountaintop cave for a while. I may do so yet.Naturally, the personal comments I heard concerning the film were overwhelminglypositive. Fire in the Sky received some very good reviews, and some not so good(although not nearly as bad as reviews I’ve seen of some box-office giants). Onething I knew long before I had the faintest idea my book would ever be made intoa movie was that film critics’ opinions are completely irrelevant to the actualworth of a movie. All my life their opinions have been as likely to differ asthey are to coincide with my own reactions to certain movies.“Come on,” some will say, “you’re just miffed that yours didn’t get 100-percentrave reviews. Film reviews have to have some value, right?” Wrong. This alsogoes for enthusiastically good reviews. No movie has ever received uniformlypositive reviews, and even the most favorable usually include some negativeremarks.At present, the considerations which can prejudice a reviewer one way or theother are so many and so frivolous that to take any one of their opinionsseriously is the equivalent of flipping a coin. Because the critics presumetheir personal tastes are the sole arbiter of the quality of a film, doesn’tmean we need do so.I have hundreds of reviews of Fire in the Sky. Nothing better illustrates theirrelevance of reviews than comparing them to each other. For any comment, I canfind its opposite. The best and worst comments often can be found within thesame review. Some loved the first part, but found the sequence aboard the shipunbearable to watch. Some couldn’t wait to get past the beginning and get to thescene aboard, of which they said they wished there was more. Some said the moviemade my experience believable, others said the opposite.Some reviewers praised one actor and insulted another, while the next wouldreverse those assessments. Some said great acting survived poor direction,others praised the direction and dismissed the acting. Some people feltHollywood had botched a great story, others said no amount of cinematicexpertise could make a good film from a story so unbelievable. So many definite,unequivocal pronouncements directly contradicting each other. Amazing that amultibillion-dollar industry is subject to such an arbitrary rating system.Some reviewers trashed everything, while what really came through was that theycouldn’t separate their views on the subject matter (UFOs) from theirestimations of the story, the acting, directing, etc. A few unknowingly revealedthey hadn’t even seen the movie, not because of anything harsh they’d said, butbecause they made very basic errors concerning the movie’s actual content.However, many loved it and gave measured praise that rang true by speakingdirectly to realities in the film with insightful analysis of what was actuallydepicted.Even though it’s standard procedure for promoters to select bits of the bestlines from reviews of their movies and make them part of every advertisement,Paramount didn’t do so with Fire. However, my foremost detractor culled fourteenof the most negative reviewers’ remarks he could gather (absurdly referring tothem as “representative”) and gleefully reprinted them in his newsletter, as ifsuch pettiness highlighted anything but his irrelevance—in effect, a review ofhis own character.Plenty of approving opinions were available:“The scenes inside the craft are really very good. They convincingly depict areality I haven’t seen in the movies before.” (Roger Ebert) “Uncommonlyintelligent and deeply disturbing . . . [it] may just be among the scariestmovie sequences ever. The performances are uniformly good. Particularly strongare Sweeney’s Walton . . . and Patrick’s foreman.” (The Kansas City Star)“Then is it a good movie? Yes. Why? Because it exploits our curiosity withoutinsulting our intelligence, it is nicely crafted, respectably acted and seriousabout its subject, and because the movie is as much about the effect of thiskind of incident on the folks involved as it is about the inherent truth of it.We will call Fire in the Sky three stars out of four.. . . A suspenseful curiosity piece . . . a very well made film.” (WTXF-TV/Foxfilm critic Bill Wine)“I highly recommend this film . . . We were also impressed by the quality andsincerity.” (RUFOS)“Besides a look at human behavior and the character-driven approach to tellingthe story, the special effects . . . are phenomenal and quite believable.”(Siegler, Entertainment Today)”. . . well-cast, capably shot, and a fairly balanced presentation of events . ..” (Gannett News Service, the Reporter Dispatch)“. . . don’t miss Fire in the Sky. ” (60 Second Preview)“ [The] fabulous alien sequence is the best bit of filmmaking on-screen. It’svisceral, dynamic and frightening.” (Toronto Sun)\". . . handsomely shot . . . and well cast.” (the Union Tribune)“This is a gripping film that operates on many different levels . . . Thedirection by Robert Lieberman is smooth and, supplemented by Army of Darknesscinematographer Bill Pope, becomes quite extraordinary.” (Daily Trojan)Equally favorable comments were expressed in Australia:“Fire in the Sky works as totally compelling cinema because it sticks to knownfacts and the actors perform with power and conviction.” (Sunday Mail, Adelaide,Australia)“A surprisingly plausible drama.” (Sun-Herald, Sydney, Australia)“. . . thoroughly entertaining and thought-provoking . . . truly involving . . .” (Countryman, Western Australia)“. . . a sensitively drawn study of an incredible event which vastly affectedthe lives of the men directly involved.” (X-press magazine, Perth, Australia)As of this writing the U.K. release has yet to occur so reviews are notavailable. I won’t include the Italian because I can’t read the language, andour local media doesn’t review movies.In the final analysis, you don’t need anyone to tell you what you like. Just gorent the video and judge for yourself. I think you’ll be glad you did, becauseit is an intense and thought-provoking experience, especially for those who’veread this book.I take more seriously the average person’s opinions and comments after they’veactually seen the movie. Remember that the reason I finally agreed to allow mybook to be made into a movie was in the hope of breaking down emotional barriersto an objective analysis of the bare facts of the matter. From all indications,the film has succeeded in doing that. I noted a profound shift in people’sattitudes. People were moved to come up to me and tell me how they felt, as theyhad never done before. Clearly a gap had been bridged—very gratifying to me.Unlike a documentary film, a dramatic movie, although it can convey facts, isbest at its intended purpose—that of approximating a subjective experience. Onthe other hand, a book, though it can (if written dramatically approximateexperience, is best at communicating facts. This book is designed to follow upon people’s readiness to reexamine the facts, which was stimulated by the film.That’s my emphasis here.In this pursuit I must now attend to the dramatic license taken with the storyand try to clear up any misconceptions arising from alteration of major facts.I’m not going to try to expound minutely on every detail; that would beunnecessary and tedious. Most people understand completely that the movie was adramatic representation of a true story—not a documentary.Still, there were purists who felt profoundly disappointed—some even becameangry—that the movie wasn’t a precise recreation of everything that happened.Carried to the extreme, such an endeavor would have cost more than the combinedbudgets of every movie made that year, resulting in a movie hundreds of hourslong. Even though there have been many other recently made movies aboutreal-life stories that took far greater liberties with the facts, for somereason that criticism never became an issue for any of them.The purists seemed seriously to feel that the movie should have been shot inSnowflake; that tons of money should have been spent to restore Snowflake’sappearance circa 1975; that as many as possible of the people involved shouldhave played themselves; and, especially, that my five-day experience should havebeen recreated as precisely as possible.The purists were more likely to be people close to the story—such as friends,family, and those directly involved—or people in the UFO community who werealready familiar with the facts and details of the case. Still, there were thosein the general public, even some journalists, who felt short-changed when theylearned about the departures from reality, especially those concerning theabduction experience.As extreme as some of the purists’ positions were, I felt a degree of empathyfor their views because I myself had once been there. A part of me wanted toyell, “I told you so!” But so much good is being accomplished in the net effectof the movie that I’m committed, inner reservations aside, to an apologist’sposition on the issue. The UFO community ought to see this film as abreakthrough, because this is the first time a major studio has been willing totake the subject seriously enough to make a movie from a real-life story.First of all, as I’ve said before, a multitude of factors conspire to deem anoptimum length for movies of about a hundred minutes. Obviously, in order todepict any story that actually occurred in a span of more than one hundredminutes, a certain amount of condensing is going to be necessary. Although, forme, events relevant to November 5, 1975, now span decades, Fire in the Skycovers only two years.The bottom line is that in order to pack two years into a hundred minutes andkeep it intelligible, it’s necessary to simplify. A good part of the changesfrom reality were made purely from that motive.My two brothers served the same purpose in the story, so they were combined intoone part. The same with the law officers. So many of their real-life rolesserved the same purpose that they were combined. (Which allows more than onelawman to claim proudly—and accurately—that he was played by James Garner.)There were actually seven of us out there; in the movie there were six. So thisis no “embellishment”—obviously, it would be great if there were twentyeyewitnesses. Mike Rogers actually had four daughters; in the movie he has onlytwo. In reality I encountered two separate ufologist groups: a flaky one, and alegitimate one which sponsored much testing with corroborative results. Only theflaky group made it to the screen.Most of these changes didn’t really alter the dramatic essence of the story.They did serve to reduce the number of characters the audience had to keep trackof. Time was also compressed to make events flow together and to provideemotional continuity.The crux of the issue is that if all those things had been represented just asthey were in real life, the story would basically have delivered the samemessage—only not as clearly. Art is life tidied up.As mentioned, ufologists and others have taken extreme exception to what theycharge is the complete fictionalization of the abduction sequence itself. A feweven implied I had sold out, allowed the corruption of my story for gain. Theyseemed to blame me for everything they didn’t like, even after learning I wasallowed no say in the matter. I was given some rationalizations by thefilmmakers for why the changes were made, but I can only speculate as to whatconsiderations truly prompted this approach.Since I never really received a complete explanation, I can only guess how muchof their thinking was governed by “C.Y.A.”—Cover Your Assets, just in case mystory was later disproved. The explanation I was given was that the aliens’appearance had to be changed to avoid similarity to other, more cheesy andridiculous, earlier presentations of those beings, and (from descriptions inother, less-publicized reports) to provide more visual interest than would havecome from images that had been seen before.I understood this reasoning, although I didn’t feel it wholly justified thealiens’ changed appearance—which wasn’t all that drastic of a change anyway.After all, they didn’t become tentacled octopi, hairy beasts, or insectoids.They remained four-foot-tall, hairless humanoids. The compromise, however, wasthat the creatures were shown to use large-eyed “spacesuits\" (the only spokenword in the abduction sequence), which the filmmakers felt more closelyresembled my descriptions.But why were events also changed? Maybe it’s simply that creative people find ithard to restrain themselves from being too creative. They may have reasoned thatsince I couldn’t remember everything, and the fact that I couldn’t remember somuch of that time had filled me with great foreboding, that this justifiedillustrating what could have been the source of my anxiety. In other words,since anything might have happened during that unremembered time, here was agold mine of untapped possibility, wherein they exercised the creativity theyhad to restrain in working on a real-life story.A few people explained the fictionalization by suggesting that the filmmakershad become part of the conspiracy to obscure the truth about UFOs, but Iseriously doubt that. It is far more likely that they simply believed, correctlyor not, that their changes made the story more commercially viable. I’m not surewhere the intentional ends and the coincidental begins, but what follows are myown interpretations of how several elements in Fire in the Sky correspond verywell, at least in a symbolic fashion, to what I remember. If I couldn’t havethings in the movie represented just as they actually were, the next best thingis to have people leave the theater with the same emotional reaction they wouldhave had if they’d been through the experience themselves.I had gradually regained consciousness in a small, dimly lit place, with an oddtaste in my mouth, in a strange, heavy atmosphere that made it very difficult tobreathe. All those conditions combined with the sense of being trapped toprovoke intense feelings of suffocation and claustrophobia in me. The filmcontained corollary scenes: one in which the actor portraying me wakes up in asort of cocoon or pod, and another in which he’s trapped, held down by amembrane, unable to either move or breathe.I couldn’t describe the details of the medical-looking instruments I had seen,but even so, seeing them certainly had made me shudder at how they were to beused—or, worse, how they might have been already used—before I came to. So, inthe scene where I am held down, undergoing terrifyingly bizarre procedures, eventhough the strange instruments used in the film were not created from mydescriptions, the incredible intensity of that scene succeeded in conveying myfeelings to the audience.My first book, The Walton Experience, related descriptions of my feelings ofbeing loath to touch, or be touched by, the aliens. Hence all the icky goo ofthe film. I experienced feelings of being manipulated, of being subjected, ofbeing powerless to control my own fate—thus the actor being dragged and slammeddown onto the table like a slab of meat. I described feeling I was beingexamined, like a bug in a jar—the unbearableness of their gaze, their eyesseeming to see right through me, so that I felt mentally naked before them. Theactor is represented as being physically naked, which also serves as a metaphorfor helplessness.My single most overpowering memory was that of their huge eyes. There was alsosomething very striking about the eyes of the human-looking beings. After myreturn, people who know me were very affected by the look in my eyes, especiallyby how red they remained for such a long time after. The eyes of everyone wereon me. It seemed the whole world was staring. Appropriately, then, the mostoverpowering scene in the movie (for me) concerned the things done to theactor’s eyes.The disorienting feeling of entering the automatically darkening,planetarium-like room, and being surrounded in all directions (including belowme) by the appearance of empty space, translated in the film to the disorientingeffect of weightlessness in a dimly lit area. In the movie, the room where thespacesuits hung was a decompression chamber, the analogue of the airlock-likeroom I passed through.I lashed out at the aliens with the back of my arm and with a rodlike object; inthe movie the actor kicked one of the aliens. For me, my motorcycle symbolizedfreedom, individuality, and self-determination, the very things I felt thegreatest lack of during those five days, thus the actor risking so much to grabthe motorcycle key floating by. The key symbolizes to me my search for a wayout. My character being dragged down the hallway obviously was inspired by myactual dash down the hallway, propelled uncontrollably by panic. My terror thatI might encounter them again around every corner was represented well on thescreen.As I said, I don’t know how many of these parallels are coincidental and howmany, if any, were intentional. But the odds are doubtful that that manysimilarities came about by chance, and it seems to point to at least asubconscious symbolism on the part of whoever created those sequences.My experience of encountering what appeared to be living humans—rather thandecomposing ones in a honeycomb of cocoons, as in the movie—is omitted. Why?Again, probably to simplify, to focus on the more sensational, core aspects. Theessence of the story is my abduction by aliens. Maybe the filmmakers didn’t wantto complicate things with something begging so loudly for explanation. To showthem would have introduced an unresolvable mystery which would have distractedfrom the other the mess being explored.Purists might insist that paralleling, symbolizing, and evoking the sameemotions aren’t good enough; the movie ought to have shown it exactly as it was.I understand, because I had at first been very upset about it myself. Myearliest concept of what this movie would be was a precise, point-by-pointexposition of the evidence, charges, and countercharges. At last, it would bethe proper forum I deserved, a final vindication. A chance to say what needed tobe said and be heard.However, there are two reasons, from my point of view, why some of what was doneactually better achieves my goal of making people feel what I felt. First isthat, if one saw an actor merely standing, breathing hard, looking panicked, onewould not understand why he felt that way. But showing a man’s face, covered ashe struggles to breathe . . . the viewer not only understands, he identifies. Inthe absence of dialogue or narration, showing is the only way.The second reason is that audiences have grown spoiled by ever-more-fantasticeffects—both visual and auditory. No gun ever roared in the way moviesoundtracks cause them almost to speak the emotion of the person firing. In reallife, if a rock came through one’s window, the crack and tinkle would be nothinglike the shattering sound and buckets of glass-shards that flood the room in amovie.It’s gotten to the point where audiences react as if movies are more real thanlife. It’s ironic that sometimes depicting reality exactly as it is fails toconvince viewers as well as the familiar film “metaphor.” Real-life eventscausing tremendous emotion in us would bore people seeing the same thing onfilm. Hype has inflated the currency of emotion, but part of the reason for thisinflation is that people respond less intensely knowing “it’s only a movie.”To evoke any emotion as intensely as it’s felt in real life, filmmakers find itnecessary to up the intensity a few notches. Nevertheless, as intense as Fire inthe Sky is, no one can possibly fully experience what we did.The movie prompted renewed interest in one question that was earlier often askedabout my experience: Were the aliens really so malevolent? Are they good orevil? Some people claimed the aliens’ representation was so bad as to be theresult of influence by government propagandists. There’s no question that in themovie the aliens appeared to be, if not quite bad guys, at the very leastungracious hosts.Many people find it hard to comprehend that superior intelligences could be soevil. As I have always said, perhaps I only experienced them as bad, due to thetraumatic circumstances. The shock of abruptly seeing intelligent creatures sounfamiliar in appearance, together with the pain, feeling trapped, and the panicof feeling suffocated, all combined to make for a totally terrifyingexperience—which the movie accurately relays.However, in hindsight I’ve noted that I was returned apparently unharmed exceptfor mental trauma; that fact suggests some kind of moral responsibility.However, who could fathom the purposes of such minds? The bottom line is,although it is not an accurate representation of the creatures I saw, the filmdoes accurately evoke emotions like those I felt at the time. One of my chiefaims in the film was to impart my emotional experience.Some ufologists were a little offended by the scene with the fictional ufologistJarvis Powell, and the nonexistent AFAR (American Foundation for AerialResearch). I had nothing to do with that. I’m told it was an invention straightfrom the film director’s imagination. I don’t for one second see AFAR as arepresentation of APRO, because APRO was completely professional and scientificat all times.The only other ufologist group we had any contact with in the first few days wasGround Saucer Watch. It was William Spaulding of GSW who, before I was everreturned, suggested obtaining the urine sample. And it was in dealing with GSWthat I first had contact with pseudoscientific nonsense and flaky people withbogus credentials. So even though the character of Jarvis Powell and AFAR werepurely fictional, I know who I picture in that role when seeing the film. Forthe record, respectable ufologists needn’t be concerned about having provided amodel for that scene.The scene leading up to me being hit by the beam was quite accurate; ifanything, it was perhaps played down a bit. Differences were pretty small. Wedescribed the craft as having the glow of hot metal, fresh from a blast furnace.But we meant yellowish white or white-hot, not red-hot. The movie has thesurface of the craft actually looking like flowing molten metal. And the overallshape, although generally disc-like in form, was different.Also, when the beam hit me, it was much more dramatic. The film made it looklike the beam came on and stayed on, holding me in its grip before tossing meback. What really happened was that it hit me with a brief, powerful blast muchmore blindingly brilliant than in the movie, and I was instantly blown backward;which was, I think, far more visually stunning than the way they did it.Some details were fictionalized to emphasize the friendship between Mike andme—for the “buddy film” aspect of the script. My firstborn son wasn’t namedafter Mike, but again, film better shows than tells. Rather than simply saying,“They were close friends,” ways are sought to make people actually feel it. Inreality Ken Peterson was the one to call in the report to the deputy. In themovie Mike was shown making the call, in keeping with his status as leadcharacter in my character’s absence. His doing so provided an artisticcounterpoint to the phone call he receives from me on that stormy night later inthe movie. That call, too, used dramatic license. The real-life call went to mybrother-in-law, because neither my mother nor Mike had a telephone at that time.There wasn’t any rainstorm the evening of my return. However, odd atmosphericconditions that night did cause the smoke from the prescribed control-burn offorest debris to the north to drift along within a few feet of the earth, in thelow areas between Heber and Snowflake. The wild ride out and back to rescue megained an added dimension of weirdness, because the smoke resembled ground fog.Here is an example of truth being stranger than fiction—too much stranger.Representing conditions as they actually were would have been mistaken byaudiences for a clumsy attempt to add horror by resorting to clichédmonster-movie effects. So instead in the movie, it rained. But again, thisunderstated reality rather than embellished it.Even a few nonresidents of Snowflake remarked on the way townsfolk seemportrayed as a bunch of clods and hayseeds. No, this wasn’t my revenge onSnowflake for not reacting more sympathetically to our report. Nothing in thescript told me how locals would look and act. And keep in mind they weredepicting people from seventeen years before.I was as surprised as anyone, but I shouldn’t have been. Recall my remarks inthis book’s preface regarding metrocentrism. Such may explain the “hick” take onlocal residents, but also, the language of film relies on simplifying manythings into readily identifiable concepts. Which is a nice way of sayingeverything gets stereotyped.Accepted polygraph-testing methodology was not followed in the movie. Instead of“boring” people with the strict yes-or-no of proper polygraph procedure, theylivened things up with “phrase” answers. In real life, only one such goof-upwould ruin a test.As far as I know, no buried dog was discovered by searchers. They did digthrough piles and checked into spots of disturbed earth on the contract, lookingfor my body. Anyway, the suspense of digging up something dead and finding outit wasn’t me was effective, even though it was in the direction of increasingsuspicion of my crewmates.It’s really amazing that the movie increased people’s acceptance of the realityof our experience, because nearly every single departure from reality with anybearing on support for the story came down against it! Many, many pieces ofpositive evidence were omitted, many false clues against it were added. Earlierversions of the script played up even more the murder-mystery angle from theinvestigator’s (and the audience’s) point of view.There never was a copy of a tabloid newspaper in the crew truck. I didn’t evenknow what a tabloid was then, and I don’t know if back then there was evenenough of a local market for tabloids to be sold in Snowflake. There was a timewhen no alcohol was sold here and, even more recently, when no “men’s magazines”were sold.)In reality all the men returned to the site, instead of Mike going in alone asin the movie. In reality, the sheriff and his men did search the site the samenight they received the report. In reality Allen Dalis didn’t yet have hisserious record of armed robbery. In reality there was no suspicious cut onAllen’s hand, with the crew trying to cover up how he got it. Dalis’ and myfight didn’t happen that day, although the tree-felling incident did. There wasno quarrel that day between Mike and me over my relationship with Dana. Therewere no conspiratorial “Let’s stick by our story” remarks among the crew. Thefilm exaggerated the confusion in finding the exact spot of the sighting andabduction. (The men quickly resolved that question right after they returned thefirst time that night, by finding my heel-prints from where I’d exited thetruck.)In the movie, the sheriff asked the men to take the tests, and at first they“flatly refused.” In real life the men were hollering right off for lie-detectortests. Two tests, in fact, for comparative purposes—they feared a governmentcover-up. They also asked to be given sodium pentothal (“truth serum”). In themovie, after the tests they were asked to return for retesting, and refusedagain. In real life, the first day of tests were considered sufficient; andlater we answered our foremost detractor with a challenge to have us retested.In the movie, the sheriff character, Frank Watters, said in a radio interviewthat “polygraphs are inconclusive” and that he believed the men were lying. Inreality Sheriff Gillespie went on record with: “I gotta say they passed thetests,” and that he believed the men were telling the truth.The actor with the greatest audience popularity, James Garner, was cast as anunwavering skeptic. A scene showing the man taking Geiger-counter readings atthe site was filmed, but cut from the movie (only his screen credit remains).Tons of corroborating evidence (discussed at length earlier in this book) didn’tmake it to the screen.In no way could anyone accuse Paramount of taking the position of embellishingthe story to improve our case, when they didn’t even put the best face forwardof evidence as it existed. The opening credits say “Based on [not “This is”] atrue story.” The closing credits end with a disclaimer: “This motion picture isinspired by actual events. However, the names of certain of the charactersportrayed have been changed and certain incidents portrayed have been created ordramatized.”The film doesn’t actually show the incident happening; it merely dramatizes,with a sort of third-person treatment, what the men told authorities, and whatcame out under hypnosis. And after each of these sequences they had Watterssaying mockingly, “Do you expect me to believe or rolling his eyes in cynicaldisbelief. (Recall those indignant claims that not one single thing described inmy original book, The Walton Experience. was used in creating the UFO-abductionexperience in the movie.) My feelings aside, concerning the filmmakers’avoidance of an endorsing stance, the fact is that a straight, camera’s-eyeview, or “omniscient” perspective, was used only for events no one challenges.If Paramount were interested (which they weren’t) in bothering to refute theattack made by CSIGOP that they had misled the public by saying “Based on a truestory,” they could have defended themselves easily by asserting the moviequalifies as being fact-based even in the most skeptical appraisal, because itdepicts as unquestioningly factual only the events no one disputes.In fact, Tracy Torme used exactly this defense on a few occasions. From no one’spoint of view could it be a matter of belief or opinion that seven men went upthe mountain and only six returned; that they reported what they reported; andthat there was an official police report of a missing person. It’s undisputedthat there was a massive manhunt, an extensive investigation, polygraph testingof the men, a worldwide media barrage, and 2. mix of psychosocial effects andcontentions which severely disrupted a normally quiet, conservative community.Those points were the focus of the movie.We’re certain of the reality of what happened to us, but as I’ve admitted, noone but us can know as we know. So I can’t find fault with the filmmakers fornot going beyond what they could personally know. I’ve gotten beyond mydisappointment that they didn’t come out foursquare in unqualified confirmationof our reports. Who could fault them for facing the realities of operating in asociety with the largest number of lawyers per capita of any nation in theworld?—a nation with an insatiable appetite for all the public butchering apredatory media can throw to it. Even though I still feel there might have beena better way, I recognize the priorities and pressures affecting the filmmakerswere not the same as mine.As I write these words, Fire in the Sky is concluding its run in the theaters.My experience seems to be completing one phase and entering another. Just whatthe previous phase will come to mean, and what the next phase holds, only timewill tell.For the international release of Fire in the Sky I traveled extensively, seeingcountries I’d always wanted to see. We were in London for the queen’s birthdaycelebration and saw the sights: Buckingham Palace, the Crown Jewels, the Towerof London, London Bridge, and Piccadilly Circus. (A fax to sex author Shere Hitefrom her Japanese publisher was delivered to my room by mistake. Sorry, itwouldn’t be ethical to reveal the message.) Rod Stewart and his wife, supermodelRachel Hunter, had lunch at our hotel during our stay. The historic LanghamHilton, which had an all-new interior resulting from having been gutted by fire,had another fire while we were there which caused everyone to be evacuated tothe street. Dana and I searched for Mike and his lady in the crowd, but we laterlearned they had been out sightseeing during the entire uproar. It had been sucha small fire, in the kitchen, that none of the other guests had seen any smoke,either. The concierge said it had been extinguished even as the alarm went off,but that since it had triggered more than one detector in the vicinity of anelevator shaft, regulations required the full drill: taking the elevators out ofservice, fire trucks, and all. Before we discovered what was going on, the drilldid create some anxious moments; especially when we encountered a guest in awheelchair at the top of the stairs. I was all set to leave our bags behind andcarry her, chair and all, down all those stairs. She and her companions refused,explaining she did have limited ability to move some without the chair if theyassisted her.Our reactions to the fire alarm were somewhat blunted by having experienced afalse alarm some weeks earlier, in our hotel in Brisbane, Australia. On thatoccasion the fire alarm had been triggered by workmen who’d created a short inthe wiring. The loud sound went on interminably while they searched for thecause. Mike slept through that one. In Australia we had seen all the majoreast-coast cities, the wildlife, the rain forest, and the Great Barrier Reef—theonly living thing on earth large enough to be visible from space.We saw the famous ancient structures of Rome; we visited the Mouth of Truth. Notlong after our return home, a terrorist bomb exploded near where we had walkedoutside the Forum. Ironic that a symbol of rational discussion is chosen as aplace for those who implicitly deny the value of rational discussion. I don’tknow what their grievance was, and neither do most of those around the world whoheard the news of the bombing. All that really comes across is that anothermeaningless act of destruction has occurred somewhere. Gee, we’re impressed.Won’t those bozos ever learn they aren’t getting attention for their views,they’re only succeeding in drowning themselves out with their own blasts?People ask me if I’m satisfied with the way the movie turned out. In the finalanalysis, will it have achieved what I’d hoped it would? That remains to beseen.I’m a bit cautious, but if the afterglow that exists now remains, we’re on ourway. Robert Patrick, the former T-1000, has great local appeal. Snowflake beinga ranching community, D. B. Sweeney’s Lonesome Dove has a bit of a cultfollowing and, as the star of The Cutting Edge, he has become a bit of a teenageheartthrob. The rest of the cast are also rising stars, except of course forJames Garner, who is a legend. The whole cast were excellent spokespersons forthe first shout of a message the world needs to hear. No explosions to gain ahearing for this message. But a little star power to open the channels ofcommunication doesn’t really do any harm, although it’s a sad commentary thathumanity is in a condition in which even such benign measures are necessary.Tracy Torme says his next project will be a western, Stormriders. He’s donethree projects on UFOs and won’t be doing any more. It just might be the lastwords on this subject for me, too—if they’ll let me.The song over the closing credits of Fire In The Sky was “Sons and Daughters(reprise)” performed by the Neville Brothers, and it went like this (lyricscourtesy of A&M Records):You can’t stop running waterYou can’t kill the fire that burns insideDon’t deny our flesh and bloodDon’t forsake our sons and daughtersI think we ’re all running, thinking we can hideI think we ’re running, trying to get awayBut sooner or later we ’re gonna realizeAnd meet up with the truth, face-to-faceYou can’t stop running waterYou can’t kill the fire that burns insideDon’t deny our flesh and bloodDon’t forsake our sons and daughtersIts freedom of speech,As long as you don’t say too muchSooner or later we’re gonna realizeAnd meet up with the truth, face-to-face.Think about it. (T.W.)"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15ConclusionThe most useful piece of learning for the uses of life is to unlearn what isuntrue.—Antisthenes, 445-365 B.C.As I scanned the foregoing for basic threads to tie together into this overview,I took to musing. Although the idea that rural people have any inordinateinterest or belief in life on other worlds was refuted, there is one good reasonwhy they should have developed such a greater interest. On a moonless night, athigher altitudes, away from the haze and light pollution present over evensmaller towns, the uninitiated are stunned by the view. Like a billion sapphirescast upon the blackest velvet, stars are then visible in such greater numbersand with such vivid brilliance that it seems almost possible to discern thethree-dimensional reality of the vast differences in their various distancesfrom us. It is sobering to think that anyone can view that majestic panorama andretain any illusion of our absolute uniqueness.What is the star nearest to earth? Surprisingly few people can correctly answerthat question. It’s not Polaris, not Alpha Centauri, Betelgeuse, nor ProximaCentauri. The answer is, of course, the sun. My kids read this to me from a bookof riddles brought from school. But the effectiveness of that questiondemonstrates a prevalent mindset that I feel played a part in people’s reactionsto reports of our incident.The earth, sun, moon, and stars. Such is the sequence of mention in mostlistings of those astronomical bodies. In everyday thought their order ofapparent magnitude becomes their order of importance in the cosmos. Forgotten isthat our sun, blazing unequaled in our daytime sky, is but an average star, in aperipheral position in a typical galaxy, in an infinity of galaxies withoutcenter. From out there, our star appears as much a point of light as any in ournight sky—a tiny glint lost in an endless dust of similar tiny glints.I pause, reminded here of that feeling of a “stripped ego” reported by many inour woods crew. To paraphrase my 1977 description of that emotion:“A sort of a lost feeling permeating the entire being. Perhaps glimpsing powersand intelligence far above our own, combined with the inability to affect thesevast forces, impresses us with our own lack of central importance in the overallscheme of things.“We have been moved to closely reexamine all the basic ideas and standards bywhich we direct our lives. And in this examination we found them lacking in atotality of perspective. Perhaps in taking our eyes off the ground and thinkingin terms of the entire creation of space, we have discovered the chink in thearmor of mankind’s vanity. A challenge to his egocentric concepts of the world.Man, standing in clear view of the infinite universe, finds himself fighting aninsistent feeling of insignificance.”Perhaps, in another of life’s ironic little backloops, that feeling we believedto be a result of a unique new perspective was merely our own forcedconfrontation with the very apprehensions subconsciously motivating some of theresistance to our reports.Anyway, beyond society’s tacit assumption of geocentric cosmology, a hierarchyof further egocentric thought prevails. Many think it likely our star is theonly one with planets; and, if not, then it is the only one with alife-supporting planet; if that is not true, then ours is the only planet withintelligent life—and if not that, then such intelligent life could be no morecapable of crossing the distance between us than we are.Some educated people seriously believe our understanding of physics is socomplete that if our best scientists know of no way such a journey could beaccomplished, then it is impossible. Ignored is that our history of science isvirtually composed of accomplishing one “impossibility” after another. There isa difference between not knowing how something is possible and knowing that itis not possible—a distinction too subtle for debunkers, and even for somepro-UFO people.I’ve said quite enough about debunkers, but, on the other hand, how scientificare ufologists? My incident was subjected to intense investigation by a range ofprofessional people applying rigorous standards. Even with my limited knowledgeof the field, I don’t get the impression that such standards are applied verymuch today.I see the field distributed along a curve extending from a starting point ofgood science, then turning down much too quickly into the realm of absurdnonsense. From my present position I would never presume to express my opinionof which cases are not authentic. But I think that what goes under the heading“ufology” today is in reality several distinct phenomena, some of which arepsychosocial in nature.Some people, rather than defending a position on UFOs logically and with thescientific support that is available (as I have shown is possible), try toexcuse the subject as a special case, exempt from normal standards. I may be atodds with a few of my own supporters, but I believe such a position isabsolutely unjustified. It will only succeed in further preventing the subjectfrom being taken seriously, and in practice could actually make solution of theentire mystery impossible.When I write on the side of science in this book, it is science as a conceptualideal, not as it is ostensibly practiced by some. (Especially not as coopted bypseudorationalists.) Frustration with evidence being rejected by mainstreampeople involved in the pursuit of science has led to faultfinding with scienceitself.I broadly define science as taking the best principles of thinking and of theconduct of inquiry and applying them to analysis of the universe—the entirenatural world. To imply that the elusiveness of the object of study justifiesdeclaring the matter outside the scope of science is equivalent to saying it issomething outside of nature—supernatural. “Supernatural” is a contradiction interms. If you first describe the cosmos, universe, natural world, or whatever,as everything that exists, then there can’t be anything else. No matter what itis called, whatever exists, exists. And is therefore a proper object of study.Science is not perfect; rather, it is forever unfinished, and rightly so. It isby definition tentative in structure and content—contingent and conditional inits perpetual refinement of methods and that which it holds as “facts.“Inevitably there will continue to be radical new reorderings, “paradigm shifts.”But encountering great problems in studying rare and inaccessible phenomenaisn’t a warrant to abandon your tools, it is a call to refine them.We have before us in these pages mere fragments of some of the most profoundissues ever faced by the human species. And so few realize it. Discovering whoor what is behind this grandest of all mysteries will inevitably reflect muchlight on what and who we are. If handled properly it could have a far moreenhancing and unifying effect on humanity than anything ye: experienced. But ifwe are unprepared it could have the most destructive effect imaginable.Our own earthbound history of contact made with isolated societies by cultureseven minimally more advanced than those contacted has been largely a saga of the“less-advanced” cultures’ near obliteration. Is this ultimately the result offlaws in the visitors—or in the visited? Alfred North Whitehead said that themajor advances of humanity have all but wrecked the societies in which theyoccurred. But is this a given? Is it even accurate? There also have been manycases of first contact between differing peoples which fueled golden ages ofcultural refinement, long periods of mutually enriching trade, and explosiveadvances made possible by the exchange of new knowledge.It is for new knowledge that so many in this technological age yearn whenanticipating contact with an advanced civilization. They dream of the problemsthat could be solved with higher technology, never considering what great newproblems might come with it. Our arrogance could be our undoing.People seem always to envision help from otherworldly visitors simply aselaborations of our own technology. I’ve been amused by artists’ renderings ofalien spacecraft assisting the ancients in erecting their various massive stonemonuments. A far more likely speculative scenario lies in science fiction’screation of the various credos—the “non-interference directive” sort—concerningprinciples of conduct by spacefaring peoples. Many cultural anthropologistsalready subscribe to similar concepts. If advanced beings really are of a natureto desire to help us, they are certainly advanced enough to know that directinfusion of raw technology would be harmful. Humanity can’t even handle thetechnology it already possesses. Or rather, that some possess. Our so-calledhigh technology is really only an aspect of life in the developed nations. Thereare still peoples on this planet living essentially in the Stone Age. Themajority of the world’s population doesn’t live very far above that level.We continually hear how we are being outpaced by the enormous flood of new dataour “information society” constantly pours forth. Channeling off the repetition,the error, the deceptive, the outdated, the irrelevant, and the false couldthrottle that flood to a flow which is manageable, if not by any one person, atleast by the society creating it.What we need right now is not a gift of new knowledge, but of new understanding(a type of assistance more conceivably permissible under a hypotheticalnoninterference directive). As Mark Twain said, “It isn’t what you don’t knowthat hurts you, it’s what you know that ain’t so.”Day after day throughout my own life I’ve had opportunity to observe peoplearound me doing things that are actually causing many of their own problems,when they are fully aware of what would alleviate them. The same situationexists in national politics and world affairs. The knowledge to solve mostproblems is already there. So, what we need even more than the crucial skills toproperly evaluate and apply real knowledge is the will to do so. Who mustprovide that?There it is. I don’t have all the answers. Of course, it’s too early to tell ifmy aspirations will at all succeed, but I have tried very hard to elevate thelevel of discussion above what it has been. Perhaps others will continue in thatvein. These could be my last words on this subject. I’ll keep my agreement withmy publisher to make appearances to get the word out about this book, but oncethat’s accomplished, I think I’m done. I don’t mind people writing, although Ican’t guarantee a reply. I used to try to answer every last letter, but I shouldapologize because I’m still not caught up with all the mail that arrived in thewake of the movie. Now that this is done, perhaps I can get to that.This book will certainly provoke much discussion. The computer networks havealready been buzzing about issues herein, and that’s sure to increase. Aboveall, I sincerely hope to make people think.As much attention as I gave to the controversy issue, I would not want the mostbeneficial consequences of all this to be overlooked. The tremendous insightinto humanity I believe I’ve gained from my experience is but one of thesebenefits. It’s when we resolve the meaning of all this, the phenomena in generaland my experience in particular, that I believe we will have finally hit the paydirt, acquired the ultimate point of it all."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16EpilogueCovert Disinformation and Cover-upConspiracy Theories ReconsideredNever think you can turn over any old falsehoods without a terrible squirming ofthe horrid little population that dwells under it.—Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.For a long time I was only moderately impressed with various hypotheticalscenarios concerning secret efforts by certain powerful agencies to suppress thetruth about UFOs, and to discredit by devious means those making such reports.However, developments have accumulated, especially recently, which force meseriously to reconsider these possibilities.There’s a joke that goes something like this: You know you’re becoming paranoidwhen you can’t even trust those who are out to get you. Seriously, however, Ibelieve I’ve been pretty cautious about reading too much into circumstances (asI described in chapter 13) regarding unfavorable occurrences in my life on thelocal level. I’ve tried to give the benefit of the doubt. I wouldn’t want tocommit the same fallacies I’ve suffered from having used so unfairly against me.As previously mentioned, Post hoc ergo propter hoc (after this therefore becauseof this) is the error of assuming the necessity of a causal relationship betweentwo events merely because one follows the other chronologically. Long before theincidence of such things reaches the critical level of proof, by sheer numbersor the character of the evidence, they rise into the significant range of stronglikelihood. So when too many such “coincidences” begin to accrue, matching upunsettlingly in character and detail, it is time to reconsider.In my case there has been an accumulation of suspicious happenings, some ofwhich I won’t yet make public. Some are still being investigated; revealingothers simply might not be wise at this point.Some of my earlier, milder suspicions began right after my return, hearing aboutmy crewmates’ apprehensions concerning government cover-ups while awaiting theirstate-police polygraph tests. I received some additional information on thisquestion from the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO), which wasconducting tests on me at the time. The outcome of the McCarthy polygraphepisode and surrounding events intensified our suspicions to some degree,although I primarily suspected bias and incompetence as causes.When my first book was published, I was annoyed that a whole page was somehowdeleted from it. At the time I just chalked it up to some kind of Murphy’s Lawirony that, out of the entire book, it just so happened that the omitted pagewas the one that, to many, would have perhaps the single most direct bearing onthe veracity of the incident—the conclusion of the polygraph test I passed!The book had a large initial printing, which sold out almost immediately. Ibegan getting word from people from all over the country who couldn’t get copiesanywhere, including directly from the publisher. I contacted the publisherconcerning a second printing. I’d had a very amiable working relationship withthem. The suggestion was put forth in writing and in a cooperative manner. Butsuddenly things grew a little cool. The publisher claimed there were still booksavailable out there, yet I kept getting reports to the contrary. A lengthy waitensued, all the while getting unmet requests from those eager to obtain thebook. Then I repeated the request for another printing. No straight answers. Nosecond printing. No books available, and yet when I requested that my rights bereturned to me, as provided in the contract under such circumstances, they saidthey couldn’t understand why I would want a reversion of rights when the bookhad “much selling life left.” I wanted to believe that maybe it was just due tosome kind of internal problems with the company. They had been going through amerger with another publishing company at that time, so maybe that wasit—financial flux and changes in personnel and priorities. Still, they were abig company and their actions seemed to run counter to their own interests. Ieventually succeeded in obtaining a reversion of rights, but the whole thingleft me quite perplexed.PJK and CSICOP have been known to attempt to discourage the publication ofmaterial they oppose by applying pressure and campaigns directed at editors andpublishers. It has been said that a censor is a man who knows more than hethinks you ought to.In the process of getting this new book published I acquired the services of acertain prominent literary agent. In the course of preliminary discussions withhim I was a bit taken aback that he brought up PJK all on his own, prior toseeing the manuscript. PJK is not that well known. The way this came aboutcaused me to feel a little cautious about proceeding without asking about thenature and extent of his involvement with PJK. The agent said it was minimal,explaining it away sufficiently to where I did continue with him for a while. (Isubsequently found a less known but more effective agent in John White.)However, he later contacted me and asked for certain pages he claimed had notbeen included with the manuscript. I was perplexed. My wife and I each had gonethrough the manuscript at least twice prior to shipping it, making certain not asingle page was missing or out of sequence. I became more than a littlesuspicious when I learned that the missing pages were nothing more or less thanthose dealing with PJK! His claims of never receiving those pages rang quitehollow when I reviewed documentation wherein he had already commented to me onthe contents of those pages. Confronted with this discrepancy, the agent revisedhis claim to say that those key pages must have been lost, probably at themanuscript photocopier’s business.I seriously wondered if the agent, or perhaps someone in his office, aprofessional reader, or someone else took those pages to obtain an advance copyfor someone—maybe even a government official or PJK. It didn’t make sense. Whywouldn’t such a perpetrator avoid raising suspicion by simply copying thosepages? Perhaps it was the result of a very brief opportunity, a hasty act by anoutsider. Unless the entire episode was just another odd coincidence ofcircumstance.An incident which provided an interesting postscript to PJK’s “Forest ServiceContract Motive Theory” occurred some while after the book was published. A manarrived in Snowflake who identified himself as a federal criminal investigator.He flashed a badge, but refused to reveal who or what had initiated hisinvestigation. He first showed up at Mike Rogers’ family reunion, interviewingpeople there. He hung around for weeks, questioning Mike’s business associates.He demanded information from Mike’s financial records. At the Forest Serviceoffice he went through Mike’s contracting records. He interrogated andcross-examined Mike for hours. His demeanor was intimidating and hostile,actually expressing his intention to put Mike behind bars.Ultimately, over a month later, the investigator tried to intimidate Mike intosigning a statement that the investigator had written as if he were Mike. WhenMike refused, the investigator became enraged. Mike stuck to his guns but, notknowing any better, agreed instead to write his own statement and sign it.The bottom line was Mike was squeaky clean; the investigator left completelyfrustrated. But Mike had been wrung out and put through hell for what eventuallyproved to be a fishing expedition. Who had sent this guy? What was behind itall? Mike still doesn’t know for certain. (But, had there been anything to PJK’scontract theory, the “investigator” certainly would have discovered it.)Certain aspects of that episode were suspicious enough at the time, butinformation recently has come to light which substantially strengthens an“ulterior agenda” interpretation. For example, this agent even gained access toSheriffs Gillespie’s file concerning the UFO incident!We do not have proof that PJK was behind that encounter, but there’s no doubtPJK will resort to tactics involving authorities as surrogates of his aims. PJKtried to turn the Forest Service against Mike. He tried to woo Snowflake townmarshal Sanford Flake. He tried very hard to induce the sheriff and countyattorney to prosecute us crewmen, with an avalanche of repeated phone calls,letters, and “white papers.” One white paper resorted to a number of uniquefalsehoods apparently especially tailored to achieve that end; as far as I know,no one else received that particular publication.PJK has instituted such “sic ’em” use of authorities against UFO proponents inthe past. Anecdotes of such activities abound, beginning in the late 1960s with“the Treatment” leveled against Dr. James E. McDonald, a highly regardedphysicist at the University of Arizona’s Institute of Atmospheric Physics. Forhis pro-UFO stance—but perhaps in retaliation for the devastating critique(partly in testimony given by him and a number of other top scientists during a1968 congressional inquiry into UFOs) of PJK’s book, UFOs—Identified, aspseudoscience—PJK launched a vociferous (but ultimately ineffective) campaignagainst McDonald in government circles, with the allegation McDonald wasmisusing navy funds to investigate UFO reports. Still, the evidence here ismostly circumstantial. We are investigating this further in an effort to confirmor refute this hypothesis.Then there are the conjectures I raised earlier in chapter 12. Readers may wishto return to page 175 to review the various theories attempting to explain UFOcrafts as being of this earth.The belief in government suppression of ufology is widespread, goes back to thebeginning of the modem era of the phenomenon, and is more alive today than ever.A 1995 national survey conducted by Scripps-Howard News Service and OhioUniversity found that 50 percent of Americans think it is likely that thefederal government is hiding the truth about UFOs from the public. Tales fromformer government personnel breaking orders not to speak out, and rumors ofsightings of strange vehicles flying in and out of certain militaryinstallations seem to support this belief. Documents have been leaked, Freedomof Information Act suits have netted tantalizing leads, investigativejournalists have dug and published books, groups have petitioned and picketedthe government.As I said in chapter 12, my witnessing the presence of beings who appeared to behuman but who were not actually human would seem a challenge to the tremendousodds against such similarity of form arising by coincidence, unless their form,and ours, is a result of some common causality beyond our knowledge orunderstanding. Still, why the conspicuous absence of the human type from mynightmares? Could that simply be due to the fact that I didn’t experience sogreat a terror from them? Or could it be due to the origin of, or controls upon,my recall? Again, what if my entire conscious memory of what happened during thefive days is an implanted memory, and not what happened at all? What if certainhumans from right here on earth are either partially or completely responsiblefor what happened to me?It would certainly require advanced knowledge to create such a craft. But givenAmerica’s huge “black budget” and the fact that seemingly futuristiccapabilities of recently revealed top-secret stealth aircraft actually representthirty-year-old technology, it’s not a question of whether or not we haveadvanced technology, but only of just how advanced it is. Other than somehowsimulating alien creatures by Hollywood special-effects methods, or by some kindof hypnotic or mind control, such a scheme would not be beyond the capacity ofpeople with virtually unlimited funding. As I noted earlier, perhaps one reasonthe Pentagon’s internal newspaper, Pentagram, gave Fire in the Sky a four-starreview and called it a “must see” is because they have an interest in myexperience beyond entertainment. Maybe my case is an inside joke to certainpeople there. I don’t know, maybe I’m reaching a bit here, but subsequentdevelopments make such speculation appear not quite so far-fetched.In gathering data for the filmmakers and in anticipation of researching thisbook, I went to those in possession of the APRO files. After the deaths of Jimand Coral Lorenzen (recall the contemporaneous deaths of Jim Lorenzen and Dr. J.Allen Hynek from the same cause—a bit of a coincidence in itself), the board ofdirectors voted to place the voluminous files of the Aerial Phenomena ResearchOrganization into the custody of ICUFOR, the International Center for UFOResearch, an organization Hynek founded shortly before his death. In accord withthe Lorenzens’ last wishes, the files were to be maintained there for freeaccess by researchers.The trustees showed me a room jammed with filing cabinet after filing cabinet,stuffed with records of cases going back decades. Coral Lorenzen had told mepersonally, early in their investigation of the case, that my file was thelargest in their records, already over a foot thick. But now, the curators,Brian Myers and Tina Choate, were able to locate nothing more than a thin manilafolder containing only a few letters of minor pertinence and some newspaperclippings, most of which I already had or could have gotten from the library.They told me they had looked around right where it was supposed to be, andsearched extensively elsewhere. No other records appeared to have been tamperedwith. But, apparently, sometime after the death of APRO’s founders and before myquest, the only copies of a huge collection of the best data on my case everassembled had disappeared without a trace! Hmmm. We’re also looking into thatdisappearance.Paramount researchers sought to obtain a copy of the original police report onthe incident, with no success. They asked us to try. As the subjects of thefile, and since it was no longer an active file, we have a legal right to accessthat file. Our right was acknowledged, our inquiry was met with verbal approval.But a series of promises to return calls and to produce the file ended withnothing but the final statement that the file could not be found. The clerkadmitted it had been there up until around the time of the first request. Then,after all these years, it had disappeared. Double hmmm.I do not believe former sheriff Gillespie would be in any way party to anillicit cover-up. In fact, he later provided us with copies of some of thedesired documents from copies in his personal records. However, he may have beenthe recipient of higher official contact or queries concerning that which he isnot at liberty to speak of. I make that suggestion based on a comment he made inan interview for an Australian television program: “I believe that there’sunanswered questions out there from outer space. I think there’s probably someoccurrences happening that our government may be aware of that they’re nottelling us.” This candor was a surprising departure from his prior publiccomments. Since the show was to be broadcast only Down Under, he apparentlyspoke more freely than usual. He may have been talking purely from his ownpersonal musings. On the other hand, due to his role in the Turkey Springsaffair, he may have become aware of things that cause him to at least suspectthat such is the case.As the release of the movie neared, there was an unexpected, excitingdevelopment. A man called to confess to me that he had been an independenteyewitness at Turkey Springs the evening of November 5, 1975! He was contriteover not having come forward sooner. He seemed rational and sincere, not flakyat all. He said he and his wife had been on a hunting trip in the area, and bothhad seen the craft; he gave good descriptions of appearance, motion, etc. Hesaid that when all hell broke loose, he had refrained from involving himself.The man said he had been in military intelligence and had been advised by hissuperior officer to keep quiet unless my crewmates were on the verge of beingconvicted of murder. I was very cautious and questioned him in detail, but hegave the right answers, including accurate topography of the surroundingterrain.I called Tracy Torme and had him talk to the guy. We agreed: he sounded genuine.The man said he had confided what he’d seen right after the incident to afriend, a known public official who would attest to that. So this didn’t looklike an afterthought, a scheme inspired by the movie publicity, I asked Tracy tocheck into it. Things were really falling into place. At last, independentcorroboration was at hand!Unbeknownst to me, Paramount flew him to L.A. and interviewed him. But somehow,Paramount’s suspicions were aroused. He volunteered to take a polygraph test andParamount agreed to sponsor one.Right before the Larry King Live show with PJK, I learned that Cy Gilson hadtested the newfound “witness.” The results were very strange—with some trulysinister implications. Not only had the man done very badly, things came tolight which gave indications of deceit and suggested possible intrigue from highlevels in our government! He failed especially badly on a question pertaining tohis previous ties with PJK! Mike had predicted that because of the movie, andespecially after the Marchbanks affidavit and the new polygraph tests, PJK wouldtry something desperate. This sure looked like an example of it to us.Astounding! A bombshell.If it is as it appears, this is evidence which may blow the lid off thegovernment coverup scenario once and for all! Previously I’d not had completeconfidence in the popular “covert disinformationist” explanation of PJK’sactivities. But here was evidence in that vein I couldn’t dismiss.Clues I had previously dismissed: PJK’s Washington, D.C., address; hismilitary/aerospace contacts as editor of Aviation Week and Space Technology; hisextensive use of standard propaganda techniques; his constant reiteration of thepolitically correct establishment party line about UFOs; and his obsessivepersistence. All now seem to take on new significance. Especially noteworthy nowis the fact that in his book (titled with unintentional aptness UFOs: The PublicDeceived), in which he devotes a substantial portion of text to attacking me, hedevotes a similar amount of space—the introduction and more than fivechapters—to a fervent attempt to refute the idea that the government haswithheld any information concerning UFOs or engaged in any cover-up. He’sproduced a great deal of other material in zealous and dogmatic denial of suchcharges.I don’t know precisely what aroused suspicion of that new-claimed “witness” atParamount, but Paramount is an organization of considerable resources. Perhapsthey’d employed some of the same “researchers” they’d discreetly sent to checkfacts around Snowflake prior to the start of production on Fire in the Sky. Theywere certainly aware of the efforts of PJK and CSICOP to discredit the filmprior to its release, with some of those broadsides in the media leveleddirectly at the studio.That witness was administered two separate series of test questions on March 11,1993, at Cy Gilson’s Phoenix offices. In Series #1 he was asked if he had beentruthful in saying (1) he had been present at Turkey Springs on November 5,1975; (2) that he had seen aerial lights in the trees there; (3) that he hadseen a blue beam; and (4) that he was then in U.S. Army Intelligence with a topsecurity clearance. He responded yes to all four questions.In Series #2 he was asked (1) if he had had any prior communication orcorrespondence with PJK or the head of CSICOP; (2) if he had conspired withanyone to discredit Travis Walton and his UFO story; (3) if he was currentlyattached or working for any branch of the U.S. military; and (4) had he beenadvised by a military supervisor to keep quiet about what he had seen at TurkeySprings in 1975. He answered no to the first three and yes to the finalquestion. (In the pretest he admitted only to having heard of PJK. but deniedever having heard the name of CSICOP’s head man.)The examiner’s numerical score on Series # 1 was a +9 (+6 and up is consideredtruthful). The computer-based analysis of Series # 1 returned a posteriorprobability of truthfulness of .930, or 93%.The examiner’s score of Series #2 was -12 (-6 is considered conclusivedeception)! The computer analysis of the second series gave a posteriorprobability of deception of .890, or 90%!However, it’s less cut-and-dried than those results seem to indicate. Whatreally complicated the examiner’s analysis is the fact that Cy Gilson was ableclearly to detect “a deliberate attempt to produce countermeasures” on “directedlie” questions! In his report Gilson also wrote: “The tracings are not natural.These odd response-tracings only appeared at these directed-lie questions.Deceptive responses did occur at other control and relevant questions but thesetracings are normal in appearance.”In spite of the reliability of some clearly truthful and deceptive responses. CyGilson was unable, based on the tracings recorded, to establish a clear resolveconcerning both series in their entirety. That inability was not due to any suchnonsense as one truthful series canceling out one deceptive series. The attemptto produce countermeasures, and some other anomalies, forced Cy Gilson to rule“inconclusive” in his overall report, although his clearest conclusions werethat the subject “was being truthful when he answered questions #R1 and #R2 inSeries #1”; and that “in Series #2 the predominant deceptive responses occur toquestions #R1 and #R4.” The fact that the results were drawn from four separateruns through the charts of all eight questions gives them even greater weight.To some, the above will be a startling revelation with implications atshockingly major proportions, although to many they are only long-awaitedconfirmation of what they’d always suspected. What concrete conclusions can wedraw from the above information? And from them, what can we further surmise aslikely? What yet-unanswered questions will be raised?The definite information is that someone with at least prior (if not current)Army Intelligence affiliation, with prior contact (which he attempted toconceal) with PJK tried to insinuate himself into the case, soon after theannouncement of the new polygraph tests, and just prior to the release of Firein the Sky.Why would this man admit to a top security clearance and a military intelligencebackground? He must have figured it would enhance his credibility and make himseem more like a star witness, in spite of the fact that this information mightalso raise some mild suspicion. Moreover, it would raise less suspicion to be upfront about it, than to risk having investigators discover it after he tried tohide it.How was he able to pass the part of the test concerning witnessing the incident?Besides his residence in the western region of the nation, he may have beenchosen for the mission because of having received specialized countersecuritytraining in beating polygraph machines (if such is possible), in which case it’sbeen demonstrated that even the elite preparation “spooks” might receive isinsufficient to beat Cy Gilson and modern polygraph testing.Another possibility is that, while even now involved in some covert scheme, heactually did witness the abduction! Recall my earlier speculation that whathappened to me may have resulted from the action of some earth agency; or, atleast, might coincide with the popular idea that aliens are involved in someongoing covert interaction with certain humans. The man’s failure to “pass” thelast question (asking if he truly had been advised by a military supervisor notto get involved by speaking up about what he saw in the Turkey Springs area in1975) may have been, on the contrary, due to his actually acting under directorders in his attempt to deceive.The intent of the scheme seems to have been to fool Paramount into believingthey had a corroborating witness, while deliberately providing enough incorrectdetails to justify claiming later that Paramount had disregarded accuracy to anegligent or even to a conspiratorial degree. The corollary plan was apparentlyto deceive Cy Gilson, then confess later to discredit the rigorousness of hismethodology, and therefore discredit his tests on all seven of us. I must admitthat, had it worked, the resulting public delusion would have completelysucceeded in achieving the objectives of those attacking the incident and theupcoming film.Mike and I learned of the test right before appearing on the Larry King Liveshow, which justifiably prompted our remarks about PJK being “a disinformationspecialist from Washington, D.C.,” and our asking: “How much is some covertagency paying you for your activities?” Curiously, although we had expected someattacks emphasizing polygraph tests such as he had made in his writings, PJKavoided the issue as carefully as if it were a pool of molten lava. Theunassailability of our recent new tests may explain his retreat; but could it bethat PJK was afraid even to broach the subject, because to do so would beopportunity for us to bring up the polygraph failure by the fake witness andthat witness’s possible link with PJK?Even though Larry King’s show is broadcast from the city where PJK resides,Washington, D.C., we heard that PJK had flown in just before the show fromCSICOP headquarters in New York. Perhaps from a panicked strategy rehearsal, ahasty tactical session? The show had been scheduled for some time; but maybe thetesting of the phony witness had been timed to make a big splash on Larry King’slive national television program in order to do maximum damage to the case andthe movie by exploiting it on the day of the movie’s debut. When thingsunexpectedly went awry, perhaps an emergency damage-control meeting was called.Just the tip of a colossal cover-up conspiracy showing through like an iceberg?Considering everything, I believe this information is as close to a “smokinggun” as anyone’s ever uncovered. But even the best polygraph isn’t absoluteproof. I can’t see how the above events could reflect a chance alignment ofcircumstance; but when dealing with deception of such caliber, one can’toverlook the possibility that even what appears to have been revealedinadvertently by the false witness was actually deliberate, not a slipup, inorder to point suspicion toward PJK for some unknown reason. However, only insuch an unlikely case can I envision a scenario that wouldn’t appear to be avery strong indictment of PJK.While we still don’t have absolute proof, if PJK did not play a role, either asthe mastermind or as a major player, I don’t know what other explanation wouldfit the evidence. It is certainly very much stronger evidence against PJK thanthe polygraph “evidence” he claimed exposed me as a fraud—even had thatso-called evidence been every bit as valid as PJK claimed. If PJK was behind thescheme, the irony would be that the polygraph, which he has used so extensivelyin his campaigns and whose veracity he upholds (citing the fact that,“Controlled tests have demonstrated that polygraph tests by experiencedexaminers are correct more than 90 percent of the time.”) has now finallyexposed him.Exactly what our alleged witness was hiding concerning communication with PJK wenever learned. No confession, nor, as far as I know, any explanation followedhis test. I understand he received a stern communication from representatives ofParamount, but I’m not aware of its precise content. No one I know ever heardfrom him again. It was a disappointing episode, a dashed hope that we’d finallyfound independent corroborating witnesses.I’d been contacted by a number of deer hunters with significant reports who werein the area at that time. We even discovered a sworn statement from anotherhunter among the papers in the police file we obtained. But we’ll scrutinize anynew forthcoming testimony very closely after the foregoing episode.However, one ultimate benefit from the affair proved as good, or better. Picturethe consternation of the architect(s) of such machinations. Not only did theplot fail completely on all counts, but actually ended up adding credibility toall they sought to discredit. Further, it flies back in the face of those behindit by showing the lengths to which they’ll go in an effort to suppress publicacceptance of this. Which henceforth impeaches every such effort from the samesource. They inadvertently provided a situation in which Paramount couldspontaneously demonstrate great vigilance and responsibility, and a situation inwhich Cy Gilson demonstrated both keen ability and complete objectivity.My fear is that my revelations here will provoke a redoubling of cover-up anddisinformation activities. Completely discrediting their first agent may simplycause them to send someone better cloaked and more cunning in his stead. Theunrestricted budget and methods available to whomever is behind them may makethe ability to neutralize me all but unstoppable. However, my hope is that myhigh visibility and making the facts public will afford me some safety. Futureattacks on this incident will be greeted with new understanding of where theyoriginate—and with whom. Any “accidents” befalling an extremely healthy andsafety-minded person such as myself will certainly receive microscopic scrutiny.I’m taking serious security precautions.Now, isn’t all this beginning to sound paranoid? Time to lighten up. It’s prettybad when you can’t even trust those who are out to get you.Cumulatively, the incidents in this epilogue add up to a pretty strong case ofsomething covert and unfriendly behind the scenes. Who, having watched such aseries of events unfold over the years, wouldn’t be moved to agree?Nevertheless, in spite of the weight of evidence, a rational, fair-minded personmust acknowledge the possibility of a phenomenally long series of incrediblyunlikely coincidences and freak accidental circumstances, somehow happening tofall together, all pointing in one direction. Only further objectiveinvestigation will conclusively resolve the question one way or the other.“Ternpus omnia revelat.” (“Time reveals all things.”) —Erasmus.In the meantime, the conclusion—the bottom line as far as this book isconcerned—is entirely up to you.

I’m perfectly aware that I could carefully knit a briefsummary of my best evidence together with exposure of only my critics’ mostblatant deceits and actually have a much greater effect discrediting them andpersuading people of the reality of the Turkey Springs incident. Indeed agents,editors, publishers, and others have urged just such an abbreviation.However, my purposes go far beyond those goals. “Never explain. Your friendswon’t ask and your enemies won’t believe you.” There is wisdom in thatobservation. But I include this material for neither friends nor enemies. Scantpossibility exists, even in the face of such overwhelming evidence, ofpersuading any of those entrenched against me to change their view. Friends areconcerned that merely bringing up some of these charges will create doubts whichwould not otherwise occur to many readers who don’t know me as my friends do.And they are right.But I will not resort to a slanted presentation such as my critics employ.Remaining true to an objective philosophy demands a fuller and more balancedaccounting. Gaining acceptance on the basis of emotional sway would be of novalue to me; evoking a fair, rational examination of the facts, even if itsomehow didn’t result in belief, would be a far greater accomplishment. Recallagain that I open both this topic and this entire book with my greatestcriticism directed not at disbelievers, but at those who were content to formany opinion without looking at the facts.I heartily commend those reading these words. By turning to this appendix and,as Socrates admonished, “following the argument wherever it leads,” you havedistinguished yourselves from less thinking individuals. Contrary towell-meaning advisors, I believe many more of you will value this material thanthey—or the debunkers—suppose. It is for such persons that I once more delve sodeeply into a past containing such hurt. Not for enemies, not even for thosefriendly to me, but for anyone interested in pursuing a more logical, rationalapproach to any of the pressing issues of our day. For it is with them I hope toachieve the greatest good, and from among them that I will be able to add tothose I call true friends.The best-known UFO “debunker,” Philip Julian Klass (hereinafter referred to asPJK), is also the principal attacker of the Turkey Springs incident. He’s theauthor of four anti-UFO books and a huge number of self-published “white papers”(up to a dozen or so photocopied sheets stapled at the corner) attacking peoplereporting UFOs and the researchers who study UFO data.He has devoted considerable parts of two of his books and numerous white papersto attacking me in particular. (I say “attacking me” because he tends to ignorethe facts of the cases he writes about in favor of personal character attacks. Idon’t know the exact number of white papers because, as is typical with hisvictims, he’s never sent any to me; undoubtedly I’ve missed having many of thempassed on from those so blessed.)PJK is closely associated with CSICOP, the Committee for the ScientificInvestigation of Claims of the Paranormal. As a founding fellow he is anexecutive councilman, Chairman of the UFO Subcommittee, a member of theeditorial board of the CSICOP journal the Skeptical Inquirer, and a frequentspeaker at CSICOP functions.CSICOP was founded not long after the Turkey Springs incident by a group headedby Paul Kurtz, president and editor of the publishing house Prometheus Books.Some charter members left CSICOP over disagreement with policies which theycomplained eschewed a genuinely scholarly and scientific analytical approach tothe issues, in favor of militant, media-oriented goals. CSICOP’s Manual forLocal, Regional and National Groups devoted seventeen pages to “Handling theMedia” and, revealingly, only three to “Scientific Investigations.”They claim to be advancing reason and science. But rather than stickingaffirmatively to advancing ideas and principles, they (like PJK) more oftenattack people and institutions with mockery, ridicule, and innuendos againsttheir character. A sad subrogation of nobler purposes.CSICOP—if the unacknowledged intention was to suggest psych-cop or thoughtpolice (shades of Orwell’s Ministry of Truth!), I can’t think of a more arrogantacronym. But “arrogant” is one perception that recurs in critiques of CSICOP.What about PJK himself? He’s devoted a huge amount of time, effort, and printfor many years to attempt to discredit UFOs. What fuels his frenzy? Nuclearphysicist Stanton Friedman, who points out that PJK is a technical journalistand not a scientist, was moved to write: “Over and over again one finds in thesewritings an unwillingness to do adequate research, false statements, characterassassination, very selective choice of data. One gets the feeling that [PJK] isfollowing orders to attack at any cost.”In 1983 PJK telephoned a University of Nebraska administrator to protest aplanned conference on unexplained phenomena at the university. He asked angrilywhat the university would do “if the American Nazi Party came in and said they[sic] wanted to hold a conference?” What a comparison! It gives you an ideawhere he’s coming from.) He went on: “. . . as a patriotic American, I very muchresent the charge of cover-up, of lying, of falsehoods, charged against not oneAdministration, not two, but eight Administrations going back to a man fromMissouri named Truman, a man named Dwight Eisenhower. Because if this charge istrue—Cosmic Watergate—then all of these Presidents were implicated, and all oftheir Administrations... [In making this charge, ufologists] seek what theSoviet Union does—to convey to the public that our Government can not [sic] betrusted, that it lies, that it falsifies. Now I’m not so naive—rememberingWatergate—to say that never has happened in history. But from my firsthandexperience (i.e., seventeen years in the field of Ufology), I know this chargeis completely false. And I resent it as an American citizen.”PJK devotes a prodigious amount of his “spare” time (reportedly up to fiftyhours a week)—incurring what must be a truly staggering telephone bill—to whathe insists is his “hobby.” He has compiled dossiers on leading UFO proponents;sometimes conducting extensive background checks, questioning relatives,employers, associates, and especially anyone from whom he can elicit potentiallyembarrassing information or an ill word for his quarry. He sifts and sortsthrough his collection of his targets’ recorded and written statements foranything that might be remotely construed as contradictory or damaging.PJK’s ties to military/aerospace sources—as editor of Aviation Week and SpaceTechnology; his Washington, D.C., address; his prosecutorial, muckrakerapproach; and his extensive use of propagandist techniques—have led people inthe UFO community for many years to speculate that he is a paid operative ofsome covert agency interested in promulgating disinformation about UFOs. As onewould expect, whether it’s true or not, he’s always denied it.Having heard the theory often, what do I think of it? It’s plausible, but so farI see no conclusive proof for or against it. If it is true, conclusive proofprobably would be unobtainable. If it is false, what evidence could possiblyconvince a dyed-in-the-wool, post-Watergate conspiracy buff?If some high-level agency were going to choose someone for such a purpose, itwould seem they would pick someone more able. On the other hand, governmentofficials aren’t known for choosing the most able—sometimes other qualities,such as blind loyalty , are of greater worth to them. Fooling most of the peoplemost of the time is good enough for their purposes. Personally I think a morelikely explanation for PJK’s obsession is suggested by PJK’s CSICOP affiliation.CSICOP’s founder, Paul Kurtz, is also founder and head of another organization,CODESH, the Council for Democratic and Secular Humanism. CODESH is a humanistorganization that publishes material attacking religion and belief in God.CODESH and CSICOP have considerable overlap in membership and leadership. Theyare housed in the same building—the Center for Inquiry—where they sharefacilities including audiovisual equipment and an extensive library.(Since CODESH is so much less compatible with mainstream views than CSICOP, itwas once treated a little like an ugly stepsister kept in the cellar lest shestigmatize her sibling. However, they’ve abandoned their careful publicsegregation and begun to bring her out—to the point of sponsoring jointInstitute for Inquiry seminars by “two nonprofit educational organizationsdedicated to the advancement of science and critical thinking.”)CSICOP’s journal, the Skeptical Inquirer, has begun straying into the religiousarea, with articles about satanic cults, the shroud of Turin, creationism,angels, and the Rapture, but CSICOP’s leadership claims to be resisting thetrend: “The issues we address must have some scientific content—or pretend toit—or benefit from an understanding of human psychology. Many readers want us tocritique religion as such or skewer some ideology they disfavor. That’s not ourinterest and it’s not our intention.” Such were CSICOP’s words concerning their“statement of mission” in a past issue.It’s no coincidence that Paul Kurtz’s publishing house, Prometheus, publishesPJK’s books. An examination of the title index in Prometheus’ trade catalogprovides some interesting insights. Forty-some anti-paranormal titles; anotherforty-odd titles dealing almost exclusively with issues relating to: paraphilia,sadomasochism, bisexuality, transvestites, child sex abuse, porn actors,prostitution, adultery, and asphyxiophilia.There are other peculiar titles, such as Infanticide and the Value of Life,Qaddafi’s Green Book, Prescription—Medicide: The Goodness of Planned Death (byDr. Jack Kevorkian), Tin Star Tyrants: America’s Crooked Sheriffs, In Pursuit ofSatan, and The Lotus Lovers: The Complete History of the Curious Erotic Customof Footbinding in China.The biggest category, however, is composed of books concerning secular humanismand atheism, with well over a hundred titles extolling humanist values orattacking religion, a number specifically devoted to anti-Mormonism. Thishumanist/atheist category includes tides such as Atheism: The Case Against God,The Darker Side of Virtue: Corruption, Scandal and the Mormon Empire, SomeMistakes of Moses, Funerals Without God, Did Jesus Exist?, and The Dead SeaScrolls and the Christian Myth. There were over fifteen books by Kurtz himself,primarily on humanism, including A Secular Humanist Declaration and HumanistManifestos I & II.The pertinent titles in the list are those linking the CODESH and CSICOP agendasof anti-religion and anti-paranormal: Science Versus Religion, A SecondAnthology of Atheism and Rationalism, and The Supernatural, the Occult, and theBible. PJK’s friend and fellow “debunker” Robert Sheaffer (who writes for bothorganizations’ periodicals) authors both The UFO Verdict and The Making of theMessiah.Paul Kurtz’s The Transcendental Temptation: A Critique of Religion and theParanormal is the clearest link between the two organizations he founded,between CSICOP’s anti-paranormal aims and the anti-religion stance of CODESH.Kurtz’s book sums up belief in ESP, UFOs, ghosts, “fringe” science, and beliefin religion as manifestations of the same irrational human flaw. Littledistinction is made between psychic phenomena and religious visions, between theghosts of the paranormal and the spirits of religion.If those humanists don’t believe in religion, why don’t they simply turn awayfrom it and focus on what they do believe? Why do they devote so much of theirperiodicals to harping obsessively on disbelief, to personal attacks onadvocates and believers, instead of promoting their approach to lifeaffirmatively? They give lip service to that goal, but don’t appear to actuallypursue it in their publication.It should be noted that CODESH does not speak for all humanists, and that CSICOPdoes not represent the views of other skeptics who consider that organizationextremist (in fact, they don’t even represent the views of everyone within theorganizations).Rather than confining their efforts to verbal opposition solely on the merits ofthe issue, CSICOP has been accused of attempts to pressure conference sponsorsand media people into censoring views CSICOP opposes. CSICOP has billed itselfin its promotional and fundraising literature as “the lone voice defendingrationality.” Talk about arrogance—psych-cop, thought police, indeed.Journalist Jerome Clark wrote: “For CSICOP it is not enough to say that thosewith whom it disagrees are wrong. It must also depict them as loathsome humanbeings. In the eyes of this Shiite-skeptic sect, proponents of anomalies and theparanormal are agents of the Great Satan of irrationality, defined as any view,however arrived at, whatever the supporting evidence, that differs fromCSICOP’s.”In the interest of fairness, I should mention that CSICOP has claimed to havesevered ties with the person advocating “getting dirty” with “anything short ofcriminal activity.” Credit is also due CSICOP for being one of the feworganizations at least to give lip service to the idea of promoting scientificexamination and a logical approach to issues. Also, in an effort to avoidcommitting the fallacy of attributing guilt by association, it should be pointedout that there are a few (too few) well-meaning CSICOP members and SkepticalInquirer contributors who seem to do a pretty good job of practicing what theypreach. Their credible exposures of some popular nonsense should beacknowledged.However, the question remains: How effective can they be at increasing therationality of the public, when they don’t seem able to inculcate that virtue inmembers of their own upper echelons? As an active CSICOP participant, PJK hasread and sat through countless expoundings on the tenets of good science andvalid reasoning. Yet he repeatedly violates the most basic of those principlesthroughout his writings on the subject of UFOs.The tone of CSICOP’s writings and speeches is often very arrogant and elitist,as if they’re the rare few who see the truth and can truly think. Their meetingsare publicized primarily among their own membership; the $ 125 admission fees donot seem intended to bring in the public, but rather to preserve the exclusivityof their cloistered inner circle. Speeches relying heavily on derision of theviews they oppose, and the self-laudatory ceremonies annually bestowing awardson their fellows—“In Praise of Reason,” “Distinguished Skeptic,” andothers—suggest more the activities of a mutual admiration society than of anorganization for public education.A number of popular books have been based on the observation that by some ironicquirk of human nature, people will often choose as their life’s work the onething they are worst at, that whatever personal qualities draw a person to aparticular field seem to be the qualities making them least suited for it. AsWilliam Penn said: “Truth often suffers more by the heat of its defenders thanfrom the arguments of its opposers.”I point out the parallels, affiliation, and alliances between CSICOP and CODESHwithout implying their moral equivalence, or intending to blur distinctionsbetween them which do exist.I do not attempt to suggest guilt by association—which would be a logicalfallacy (and one of PJK’s common tactics). Whether or not PJK himself shares hiscronies’ every belief is irrelevant here. The point is not one of belief noreven one of tactics, but of motivation. In the interest of even-handedness, I’mtrying to establish a plausible alternative to the “covert disinformationist”theory for PJK’s motivation. To truly understand any dogma you need tounderstand the mindset from which it comes. In the absence of additional data,PJK’s likeliest motivation seems to me to be fanatical disbelief—obsessive,overzealous, monomaniacal disbelief. Perhaps the nonreality of UFOs has becomelinked in his mind with the very survival of his ego. By some contortion ofreasoning, somewhere in his psychological makeup it has become vitally,desperately important to PJK that UFOs not exist. How else to explain suchirrational arguments in the name of rationality? It’s a theory which explainsPJK’s approach, his tactics, and his obsession. Read on and see what I mean.One thing I earnestly request of readers, in the interest of objectivity, isthat no matter what you may think of PJK personally for employing such tactics,please judge the validity of his arguments solely on their own merit. I amcertain they are without merit; my aim here is to provide you with justificationfor the same belief. But the judgment is up to you, so please base that judgmenton the facts, not on character.One might think that in referring to a man who has dragged my name through themud for decades, I’m being surprisingly charitable with the admonition above.Not at all. My respect is for the principles of reasoning. This just isn’t theplace for feelings, mine or anyone else’s. To use emotion in place of reasonwould be to commit the same error and logical fallacy PJK so regularly commits.His case falls on its own lack of merit. The first of PJK’s books attacking meis titled UFOs: The Public Deceived. When I’m done here, I’ll leave it to thereader to decide who has deceived the public. Persons unfamiliar with what PJKdid to me over the years may be a bit taken aback by my intensity, and maywonder why such thoroughness is even necessary. Persons who are familiar withhis campaign may be surprised by my restraint and by the degree to which I’vemanaged to remain objective.People who are ignorant of the rules of logic, debate, and public discourse maybe unable to appreciate the distinctions between PJK’s tactics and my own. Forthe record: Efforts to refute someone’s statements by use of ridicule, namecalling, attacks on their character or that of their advocates, family, friends,etc. are personal attacks and are logically irrelevant at best. If I havesomehow inadvertently committed this error anywhere here, I am wrong to havedone so and on that point I’ve failed to make my case, so that thread of myargument should be disregarded. Granted, to refute someone’s statements mightwell result in their lowered status (at least temporarily, on that particularissue), but that is not a personal attack. However, as long as one offerscompelling evidence, sound reasoning, or in some way demonstrates defensiblegrounds for assertions germane to the issue, it makes no difference howthoroughly one rebuts statements, it is not a personal attack.PJK and his mutual admiration society promote him as the “Sherlock Holmes ofufology” and now, incredibly, the “Socrates of ufology.” He allegedly possesses“unassailable logic” and “reason.” Supposedly he applies “rigorous,” “thorough,”“objective” “scientific methodology,” dealing in “hard facts,” possessing “animpressive array of scientific and technological knowledge,” and is “honored . .. for his accuracy as a technical journalist.”In regard to my case, he has demonstrated none of the above. He is notobjective. His reasoning is so flawed that in his writings about me herepeatedly commits every major, classic logical fallacy. He is neither thoroughnor accurate. He deals not in hard facts but in distortion, supposition,innuendo, and assumption, reaching one unjustified conclusion after another. Heis as far from scientific as one can get. About me, he is simply dead wrong.Where applicable I provide the necessary references to back up my refutations ofPJK’s specific charges against me. Keep in mind that as I write, I do so fullyaware that my detractors will go over my words with a sharp dental pick andmicroscope. I invite anyone interested to check out the documentation I cite. Noone need rely on my word, it’s there for all to see for themselves.In order to see just how logical and scientific PJK’s “investigation” really is,a few words about logic and science are in order.Scientific methodology has gradually become quite sophisticated in itsprocedures to enhance the accuracy of its end products, but some fundamentalsare so basic that any work done contrary to them is considered worthless. First,those making the inquiry must begin with no conclusions concerning the questionbeing investigated, refrain from drawing conclusions until all data is in, andmake no conclusion at all unless the data is sufficient.Throughout science great pains are taken to eliminate effects of investigatorbias; blind and double-blind studies, careful avoidance of loaded surveyquestions, controls, placebos, mechanical stand-ins, neutral judges,remeasurements, independent verification, the criterion of replication, andrepeatability of results, etc. Science journals tend to consider as possiblytainted the work of any scientist who displays a fervent position on a questionprior to doing the work on it. I don’t list these criteria to suggest they allshould have been applied to my case, because many of these criteria apply tostatistical surveys or experiments, which this is not. (But it was supposedly a“scientific investigation.”)My point is simply that science puts such elaborate emphasis on safeguardsagainst investigator bias because of the awareness that bias is so pervasive inhuman thinking that only constant attention to its elimination can elevate theenterprise above the level of the tangled muddle in the average person’s head.Applying relevant criteria is crucial, but so is consistency of criteria: Youdon’t treat data one way, then another, and get intelligible results. You treatdata impartially and objectively, you separate fact from opinion, data fromconjecture. Consistency, consistency, consistency: its presence does notguarantee validity, but its absence guarantees error.One key principle of good science is to report all data gathered. This isprobably the chief source of tainted work in science. Scandals regularly hit thenews about fudged or doctored data, but more common is when the experimenterwithholds data failing to support a preferred outcome. Probably because this iseasiest to rationalize, the easiest about which they can deceive themselves aswell as others. Ninety-nine-percent truth with one crucial detail omitted canresult in radically different (false) conclusions. The “truth,” without thewhole truth, is not the truth.Logic is the science of the formal principles and criteria of validity inreasoning, an ancient discipline going back to the time of Aristotle and beyond.Throughout time, in all cultures and languages, the human proclivity for certainerrors of reasoning have become familiar. Certain false reasoning patterns areso common that lists of these classic logical fallacies have been compiled.Because of their historical roots in ancient Greece and classical intellectualcircles they have been given Latin names such as ad hominem, ad vericundium,post hoc ergo propter hoc, petitio principii, and ad populum.Don’t be put off by the Latin words. Their plain English descriptions make themrecognizable as common errors we have seen used all our lives. Argumentum adhominem means “argument to the man,” rather than to the issue—appealing toprejudice, as with personal attacks, character assassination. Ad vericundium ismerely “appeal to authority,” in other words, “I’m right because Joe Blow withcredentials says so too.” Post hoc ergo propter hoc means “after this; thereforebecause of this”—which is claiming a causal relationship necessarily existsbetween two events merely because one follows the other in time. Petitioprincipii is “begging the question” or assuming the conclusion in your initialpremises. Ad populum is “appeal to the crowd,” popular prejudice, or “I’m rightbecause everybody else thinks this too.”Right out of the starting gate, PJK began his “investigation” with professedcertainty that the incident had not happened as reported. Before learning anydetails, he set out to pursue the prior intention he had expressed to APRO andreporter Richard Robertson—to prove the incident a hoax.His very earliest writings on the case were completely hostile to us, eventhough he initially knew so little about it, that he made errors he later had tocorrect or retract. All those early claims were quickly proven false, but theyillustrate that even when so hazily informed of the facts as to make errors sobasic, PJK was already totally committed to discrediting the incident.PJK’s campaign in no way fits the definition of an investigation, scientific orotherwise. Objectivity was absent from the very beginning. A genuineinvestigation seeks to determine what has transpired. IJK wasn’t interested indiscovering what happened, he was obviously concerned only with creating beliefin his preestablished position. That makes his work worse than mereproselytizing; it is best described as propaganda.Contrast PJK’s opening volley against the Turkey Springs incident with the lastof six points in CSICOP’s statement of mission, published on the back cover ofeach issue: . . the Committee . . . does not reject claims on a priori grounds,antecedent to inquiry, but examines them objectively and carefully.”Quite a number of people with various perspectives, including skeptical ones,looked into this case. They made personal visits to the site, and spokeface-to-face with those directly involved in the incident, or at least madecontact with them by phone or mail. Only PJK is the exception. He’s what Dr.Hynek termed an “armchair investigator.” He did all his work by mail or byphone; an absolutely incredible amount of it. Yet never once did he speak orwrite to me!Astounding. Presuming to second-guess hands-on researchers out in the field, hemakes what he represents as the definitive judgment on my experience and mycharacter, and yet to this day has never met me. There is no excuse for thisbecause he was able to locate some pretty obscure “witnesses” when looking formuck. I was in the phone book back then, and even during my years with no phoneI received phone messages through neighbors and relatives from a variety ofpeople determined to contact me. I have received mail from all over the worldcontaining no box number, city, state, or zip code; no better address than myname and “Snowflake, Arizona, U.S.A.”; “White Mountains, Arizona”; or“Sitgreaves National Forest, U.S.A.” The latter two don’t even refer to a singleplace; the White Mountains are a large area spread across three or four countiesand Apache-Sitgreaves straddles two states. Snowflake isn’t even quite withinthe forest boundary. (Who says the post office doesn’t do a great job?)In all those years of attacking me in a torrent of published material PJK neveronce attempted to verify with me the accuracy of what he had written about me.Over the years PJK has done the same to many others, a campaign they’ve come tocall “the Treatment”—an enormous outpouring of calumny and characterassassination, with, usually, no personal contact at all.I find this peculiar. Why would he pass up the opportunity to be able to say hehad actually made a complete investigation? Why miss the chance of getting theactual target to trip himself up or say something PJK could distort to make himlook bad? The best raw material for his smears would come straight from thehorse’s mouth. Where else could you gather better dirt? He depends so heavily onad hominem, yet is content to rely on secondhand sources for it. Why?Some suggest cowardice, inability to face those he accuses, or simply arrogantlyregarding the target as beneath personal notice. Maybe behind all the blusterand bombast is fear of rejection. (Admittedly, at this stage I would beindignant at such a belated attempt.) Perhaps it is to avoid putting a humanface on the opposition, much like the wartime expedient of dehumanizingperceptions of the enemy to make it easier on the conscience to destroy them.Insulating himself from unwanted information may be nothing more than the oldstandby, “Don’t confuse me with the facts.” Perhaps “the Treatment” puts PJK ina position where his contrived scenarios and weakly knitted “evidence” couldfall apart or become a legal liability—if it were proven he possessed contraryinformation, yet knowingly omitted it from his publications. It’s easier to usemisinformation if he sticks to indirect sources. Then he doesn’t have to find anexcuse for ignoring its correction.That legal point may apply especially to his use of ad hominem. He may havedeluded himself into believing there is a legal defense if, for some characterattacks, he substitutes an accurate quote for accurate information. “I publishedit, but they said it, I didn’t,” would justify nothing. Being able to prove astatement was actually made in many cases doesn’t relieve the responsibilityalso to ascertain if it was true in fact. And the writer is especially culpablewhen he has reason to believe the statement is false, particularly if the falseimpression can be shown to be deliberately created by careful omission ofessential context. Although truth is sometimes part of a legal defense againstcharges of libel, relevance (that is, the necessity of its inclusion), and themotive evident in its distillation and promulgation are key points. Besides,some of the most vicious things he says are in his own words.Whatever the legal defense, there is no moral defense for characterassassination, nor especially for the lack of intellectual integrity inextensive use of a logical fallacy in what is passed off as “scientificinvestigation.”I reemphasize that the volume and intensity of his barrage, and the desperationof some of his tactics, actually reveal his regard for my case and constitute aperverse endorsement of it. You won’t see him writing books and a snowstorm ofwhite papers about those phony front-page tabloid photos of aliens posing withpresidential candidates. He unleashes his greatest efforts on the case whichposes the greatest threat to his dogma of the nonexistence of UFOs.One of PJK’s particularly desperate—and despicable—tactics is “creativequotation.” On the telephone and even in person, he tape-records nearlyeverything when he’s “on the case,” and often when he’s not. Snip, snip; cut andpaste. Somehow, he can take an offhand comment here, a partial quote there,juxtapose them with some unrelated supposition, and—voila!—people are stunned atwhat he’s made out of it. Similar anecdotes of this practice abound among thosehe quotes regarding my experience and the UFO field in general.For many years PJK has been criticized for heavy use of the tactic of quotingout of context. Quoting out of context wouldn’t be an illegitimate tactic if itwere nothing more than what the phrase literally describes. A quotation is anexcerpt. Ultimately every quote is out of context. Otherwise, carried to theabsurd, you’d be obligated to include all the person ever said and allsurrounding circumstances, ad infinitum. However, the phrase “quoting out ofcontext” refers to distortion created by omission of other pertinent remarks orrelevant circumstances required to transmit fully the true or intended meaning.If the quotation PJK selects doesn’t say exactly what he wants said, he feelsfree to add (in brackets) whatever words he thinks are lacking. In other handsthis practice can be a legitimate clarifying device, but in his hands it becomesa subtle instrument of revision.He has a habit of referring to his version of things with the redundant phrase“the true facts” of the case. As opposed—we’re to surmise—to “the untrue facts”of those he attacks.Adding emphasis by underlining, italicizing, capitalizing, or boldfacing is arelated tactic, one easily subject to becoming a tool of distortion. PJK has anincredible compulsion to the overuse of such devices. Like a typesetter’snightmare, nearly every page and sometimes entire pages contain a mixture ofthree or four of those forms. I have samples where, in the midst of a pagecomprised of all the other forms of added emphasis, he actually underlined anditalicized an all-capital-letters section set off in quotation marks!When this underlining, italicizing, capitalizing, and boldfacing is done toselected passages of quoted material it has the effect of changing the speaker’semphasis and therefore his intended meaning—a bit like putting words in hismouth. It has a way of transforming the most innocuous remarks into what appearto be self-betraying slips, confessions of grave wrongdoing.When the italicizing and capitalizing is done to his own words it gives theimpression he is screaming for attention, yelling as if terrified that he’ll beignored. As if afraid his words don’t have enough clout on their own, that hispoint will be missed. As if he feels the need to add volume to make up for lackof substance. All of which actually makes him appear quite impotent.Ironically, PJK’s own group, CSICOP, printed in the Spring 1990 issue of theirSkeptical Inquirer an excerpt from Jeremy Bernstein’s book, Science Observed,which made a reference to the proclivity for this form of hyperbolousexpression: “A hallmark of crank manuscripts is that they solve everything. . .. A second hallmark of cranks is that they are humorless. A third hallmark ofthe crank is that he is sure everyone is out to steal his ideas. A fourthhallmark of the crank is that he is determined to bring the newspapers insomehow. A fifth hallmark of cranks is that they use a lot of capital letters.”How ironic. PJK is forever complaining that when he sends his copyrighted “whitepapers” to the media, they are ignored. He implies that the unfairirrationalists of the media are either a bunch of gullible fools who need to beled out of their delusion, or cynical purveyors of pap, pigheadedly failing toheed their would-be savior.Actually, I think the real reason PJK’s reports and press releases are so oftenignored is that journalists know a stacked deck when they see one. Therecipients see them as the sender’s self-promotion, and are unimpressed withtheir lack of adherence to journalistic standards in their failure to represent“evidence” or “proof’ outside the mind of their author. In other words, theyappear to be the product of a crank.As time goes on, PJK comes off more and more like a crank. He continuallycomplains of the refusal of various media, UFO experts, and witnesses even torespond to his letters, to permit him to appear with them on television, orinvite him to speak at conferences. Such frequent lamenting about being ignoredis a feature common with some of the martyrs-of-the-mind at CSICOP, those with“the lone voice defending rationality.” His writings and utterances increasinglymeander off into obscure irrelevancies—so that people scratch their heads andsay: “Even if true, so what?” (If readers find themselves occasionally askingthat question about this part of this book, it’s because that’s the sort ofmaterial it falls to me to rebut. As the philosopher said, we must follow theargument wherever it leads.)When is PJK going to understand that the reason so many professionals refuse tolisten, assist, correspond, or debate with him has absolutely nothing to do withtheir fear that he is right, that his imagined razor-sharp astuteness will leavethem exposed as incompetents or frauds? He’s apparently oblivious to the factthat they simply don’t wish to lower themselves to his level. When peopledisdain to expose themselves to—or legitimize—his obnoxious tactics, PJK writesas if they’ve conceded victory and proven his position.He constantly attempts to settle disputes concerning matters of fact by issuingpointless challenges, often with the outcome to be resolved by polygraph, or bysome authoritative body (the fallacy of ad verecundium—appealing to authority)which, if asked, would likely not even involve itself.PJK’s most effective publicity gimmick was a supposed $ 10,000 offer he firstissued back in the 1960s. He likened it to his boyhood challenge to his peers:“Talk is cheap. Put your money where your mouth is.” PJK said, “This isprecisely what I have done to demonstrate my own confidence that there are nospaceships from other worlds in our skies. . .” Upon reading the actual contractone discovers that he does not put his money where his mouth is, he merelypromises to pay the sum (if he lives) at some future point after the U.S.National Academy of Sciences announces it has proof of extraterrestrialvisitation or after an alien appears live before the U.N. or on national TV.In the first place, the absence of these events is not disproof of the existenceof UFOs. Not only is it not a given that any of those things would happen if theexistence of a UFO were openly proven (presumably a dead alien fails toqualify), but the contract only requires “the party of the second part” (notPJK) to put up real money—at $100 a year for ten years. The taker bets on PJK’sintegrity, his continued solvency, and his longevity.PJK, however, bets only on the previously demonstrated consistency of scientiststo continue officially to deny the phenomenon, and on the already demonstratedconsistency of the phenomenon to avoid open contact and leave little trace. Inother words, he begs the question, while pretending to boldly confront it.In April 1987 he issued a similar absurd offer of $10,000 to anyone reportingtheir UFO abduction to the FBI and the bureau publicly confirming it. How manypeople’s first thought would be to turn to the federal government in such asituation? In light of many Freedom of Information Act documents on UFOs, whichare extensively blacked out before release, and in light of repeated governmentdenials and a longstanding belief by UFO proponents in official suppression ofthe subject, PJK again begs the question mightily. But it makes for good press.PJK has received a lot of media attention for his Ten Ufological Principles;which, of course, are all one needs to solve the entire UFO mysterysinglehandedly. Without repeating them all here, six of them (numbers 1, 2, 3,5, 6 and 9) are basically variations on one idea, which can be summarized as:People don’t really see what they think they see, because they are eitherincapable of accurate perception, or psychologically indisposed to it.Principle Number 10 basically says that the cases ufologists fail to explainaway simply haven’t been given sufficiently rigorous effort. Read on, forexamples of PJK’s “rigorous effort.”Principle Number 4 says the news media are biased, in that they give greatattention to UFO reports when first received, but then ignore later prosaicexplanations. His criticism of the media is slanted by his skeptical bias. Muchof the initial coverage of my experience was false evidence against it, thesubsequent disproof of which the media gave little or no space or time to. If Iwere as biased as PJK, I would claim the opposite of what he claims. However, myown view, which I think a more objective perspective, is that those in themedia, for reasons often unconnected with any “slant,” don’t always give equaltime to rebuttals, retractions, or information contrary to an earlier story.Principle Number 8: “The inability of even experienced investigators to fullyand positively explain a UFO report for lack of sufficient information, evenafter a rigorous effort, does not really provide evidence to support thehypothesis that spaceships from other worlds are visiting the Earth.”(Translation: “Even if I can’t prove it, I’m right anyway.”) So much for thenamesake of “the Sherlock Holmes of ufology.”An oft-quoted saying of Holmes was that when you have conclusively eliminatedevery other possible explanation, the one that remains, no matter how unlikely,is the solution. If you summarized Number 8 as “Failure to disprove isn’tevidence in favor,” I would have to disagree. But actually, if you were tointerpret it as “Failure to disprove isn’t proof in favor,” I would agree.Our legal system may equate a man who is proven innocent with one whose guiltwas failed to be proved beyond a doubt, but such reasoning wouldn’t get one farin normal pursuits. The preference to err in the direction of freeing ten guiltymen lest one innocent be punished has no corollary in logic or science. Wecertainly can’t accept a methodological trade-off of criteria that have usbelieving ten false things to avoid the risk of disbelieving one true thing.Evidence is merely something which suggests that a particular proposition ismore likely to be true; proof is something that makes that propositionnecessarily true. Because PJK confuses evidence with proof, Principle Number 8,as it is written, simply isn’t necessarily true. (I considered including hereten principles I wrote in parody of PJK’s ten, describing what he actuallypractices in the course of his “investigations,” but I think I’ll spare readersthe black humor.)I’ve held PJK’s Ufological Principle Number 7 till last, because it is actuallyfar more germane to his modus operandi than the others. It reads: “In attemptingto determine whether a UFO report is a hoax, an investigator should rely onphysical evidence, or the lack of it where evidence should exist, and should notdepend on character endorsements of the principals involved.”Sounds okay. This principle is most pertinent to PJK’s technique, not because itis the one he follows most consistently, but because it is the one he violatesmost often. Nearly every one of PJK’s many critics list his propensity fordistorting or ignoring physical evidence as second only to his misuse ofcharacter assessment in his tactics against UFO cases.PJK launched a virtual torrent of personal attacks on my character, my fellowcrewmen, my family, and every one of the many researchers who voicedcorroborative opinions. He concealed all positive data he acquired concerningour characters, yet heaped compliments on the character of anyone who attackedme even when he had full access to negative information about them. (I’ll citespecific examples later.)At the same time, he entirely ignored every bit of physical evidence in supportof the case. In his many white papers and in his two books attacking my casethere was not a single mention of the recorded magnetic anomalies, ozone traces,Geiger-counter readings, or strange “metal” fragments found at the very site ofthe incident! Not a peep about the reports of outages of power and televisionreception in the nearest towns at the time of the incident! He was well aware ofthose reports, yet not a word about them. That’s his “relying on physicalevidence”? That’s “rigorous,” “objective” “scientific methodology”?Another part of Ufological Principle Number 7 PJK abuses continually is “thelack of [physical evidence] where evidence should exist.” He is forever building“straw men,” which he can then knock the stuffing out of by arbitrarilypresuming the necessity of some piece of evidence.(Here we see illustrated something I call the fallacy of “absence of evidenceequals evidence of absence,” or the error of negative proof; i.e., “since thepresence of Joe’s fingerprints would prove he was there, the absence of printsproves he wasn’t there.” What if Joe touched nothing, wore gloves, or wipedeverything off? When you take PJK’s repeated use of the “absence of evidence isevidence of absence” fallacy, and consider it alongside his disregard of facts,what can we expect? GIGO—the old computer acronym for “Garbage in, garbage out.”Those who are fooled by his paralogism and are unaware of the evidence heignores, would naturally be duped into perceiving his case to be as airtight asit was made to appear.)For example, PJK contends that the absence of burn marks and bruises on my bodyis proof that I was not struck by a beam of energy and knocked back through theair. He presumes to possess a complete understanding of the nature of an energybeam produced by incredibly advanced technology. He presumes that since thewoods crew said it looked like a flame or lightning bolt, that it would behaveprecisely as if it were one or the other. Where is his science? Humans usemicrowave beams in industry that can either clean delicate parts, set glue, cookfood, or transmit phone calls. We use ultraviolet energy to grow plants or tokill bacteria. Infrared light is used to remote-operate your VCRs, and to curenew paint, or strip off old paint. We use laser beams in one form to welddelicately in place detached retinas in the eye, or in another form to sliceprecise holes through blocks of metal (potentially, to blast incoming ballisticmissiles out of the sky). Various combinations of specific colors (frequencies)and energy levels of lasers have marked differences in effect. In medicine weuse ultrasound waves that can harmlessly view a living fetus, or can be used topulverize kidney stones, leaving nearby bones unaffected. PJK admits to priorreading of my 1978 book in which I wrote, “That beam behaved in many ways like abolt of lightning or electricity, but it might have been some other form ofenergy entirely.” Yet he prefers to ignore that concept in favor of his strawman.PJK is indeed a master of the arrogant assumption. Who is he to presume why thebeam didn’t blow away the nearby pine needles? Accuracy alone would account forthat. The absurdity of his presumption that any beam powerful enough to knock medown would also necessarily blow away or ignite the surrounding debris and leavemarks on me is demonstrated by comparison with a mere earth invention used bypolice: the stun gun (which does operate on electricity). Powered by batteriesas modest as those used to operate a Walkman, makers of stun guns say theirdevices are effective through heavy clothing, able to knock down athree-hundred-pound man while leaving him and his clothing unmarked.PJK claims that if I really had been knocked back through the air to hit therocky ground on my shoulder, “there should have been bruises.” Perhaps PJK hasnot been very physically active in his life. I’ve taken numerous hard blows insparring matches which never left a bruise. All the guys on the crew have hadlimbs and small trees fall on them in the course of a workday, leaving nobruises. It can take a lot to bruise a healthy, fit young man. It’s unlikelythat landing after being thrown ten feet would be sufficient to cause a markwhich would last five days, especially through a work shirt and denim jacket.First PJK claimed I should have been bruised by the “hard rocky earth”; in thevery next paragraph he claimed the same ground was covered with “a thick carpetof dry pine needles” which should have burst into flame! You may laugh at theabsurdly obvious self-contradiction, but his CSICOP cronies read it andapplauded. And these guys call themselves skeptics.But what renders all this discussion moot is that whatever damage might haveoccurred to my body at that moment could have been somehow repaired by mycaptors during the five days. So any subsequent biological or medical assessmentmust take into consideration the possibility of exceptional intervention ormanipulations of the natural system that would render any data or observationsunreliable.I believe that if I had been returned with a big bruise on my shoulder, PJKwould have argued that that was proof the incident was fraudulent, because“surely” such an advanced race would have healed it.Tighten up your critical faculties anytime you see PJK, the mind-reading“debunker,” uses words like “surely,” “should,” “certainly,” or “wouldnaturally.” “Surely” so-and-so would think or do such-and-such. Usually there’sreally no reason whatsoever to think that so-and-so would act by these imaginarynorms. Often it would be ludicrous for people to respond that way.If there had been ketones in my urine specimen, PJK would have read imaginarysignificance into it such as calling it evidence I had wandered through theforest, dazed and starving for five days, because “surely” beings considerateenough to return me unharmed would be considerate enough to prevent the effectsof starvation. Such schizophrenic interpretations permeate his writings.PJK employed a bizarre array of arguments against the Turkey Springs incident,many of them contradicting the others. He seemed reluctant to leave out anypossible theory. I remember hearing from Jim and Coral Lorenzen that in one ofhis earliest shots, PJK had tossed out the idea of a plasma phenomenon. Later,the suggestion of the misidentified planet Jupiter surfaced, then drughallucinations and transitory psychosis, among many others. Postulating acoherent theory of an alternative scenario wasn’t his goal; his aim was tocreate doubt any way he could. But his pet theory, the one he put the mosteffort into, was his Forest Service Contract Motive Theory.The Forest Service Contract Motive Theory begins with the charge that the crewboss, Mike Rogers, wanted to get out of his Turkey Springs contract long beforethe UFO incident, because it was, supposedly, an unprofitable contract. Thetheory holds that Mike could quickly obtain his 10-percent hold-back money onthe job if he could get the contract defaulted; that he needed an “act of God”excuse to achieve that result; and that he got his six crewmen to make up a UFOstory that would supposedly fulfill the “act of God” requirement.The facts are: that Turkey Springs was not a bad contract; and that nothing, noteven an “act of God” contract clause, could achieve an early release ofheld-back funds. Regardless of cause, all defaults follow the same procedure andhave the same result, except that to invoke the obscure “act of God” clausewould involve the comptroller general, adding a number of very lengthy steps tothe process instead of shortening it; quite apart from it being quite dubiousthat the government would ever allow a UFO incident to qualify as an “act ofGod.” (Perhaps PJK’s obsession with this “act of God” scenario is because hisatheist cronies love the irony they see in it.)According to PJK, Mike Rogers saw the NBC-TV movie, The UFO Incident, whichaired several weeks before our Turkey Springs encounter, and was inspired tomake up a similar tale. However, not one of the seven of us saw that movie. Ididn’t have a television; Mike says he turned his off a few minutes into theprogram. How could he be inspired by a story he didn’t see? If Mike had anythingto hide he would have denied any knowledge of the program. PJK tries to twistminor admissions of irrelevancies into fullblown confessions.This TV-show angle is actually an example of the logical fallacy of post hoc,ergo propter hoc—“after this, therefore because of this.” A necessary causalrelationship cannot be inferred merely because one thing follows another intime. In today’s media-drenched world, is it likely that a UFO incident couldever happen at a time when you couldn’t point to some book or movie release, TVshow or news story, within several weeks prior to the event and claim suchinspiration by it? Saturday-morning cartoons alone would guarantee such a windowof “suspect” exposure.PJK devotes a major part of his last book to the premise that most of what’sbeing reported about UFOs today was inspired by images from that very TV moviebecoming embedded in the national psyche. Why would a TV program withunimpressive ratings have a greater effect on the world’s subconscious mind thanany number of more spectacular theatrical movies seen by far more people? (PJKalso predicted a massive “flap” of UFO reports would follow the movie CloseEncounters of the Third Kind, a movie seen by zillions—far more than ever sawThe UFO Incident. Such a flap never materialized. Spielberg’s E.T., the mostsuccessful movie of all time, was seen by over seven hundred million peopleworldwide, but there were no global reports of huggable aliens showing up inchildren’s bedrooms. People aren’t quite so suggestible as he claims.)The Turkey Springs contract was a good one. PJK claims Mike was “delinquent” onTurkey Springs because he’d been “moonlighting” on other, “better-paying”contracts. (Jobs paying less than half the acre-price of Turkey Springs weresupposedly “better-paying.”) It is normal procedure for contractors to haveseveral jobs running simultaneously, actually quite common. Yet, PJK foolishlycalls this “moonlighting.” The Forest Service doesn’t even consider it any oftheir concern what other work a contractor may have. Some contractors havecompletely different lines of work in addition to their forest jobs. Forfulltime contractors it is necessary to have more than one contract at a time toavoid “dead time” between jobs, which would result in a contractor having hisbetter crewmen go elsewhere to maintain steady employment. And since the sameForest Service personnel award, inspect, and issue payment for subsequentcontracts to the same contractor, it’s absurd to term it “moonlighting.”Mike had received an extension on his completion deadline for Turkey Springs,not because the actual work being done on it was unproductive, but only becausehe had been finishing up some other contracts and didn’t get back to itfull-time until after mid-October, when much of the contract time on it hadelapsed. Turkey Springs was the more lucrative contract of the lot, but since ithad the latest completion date, he was finishing it up last. It would likelytake us three weeks or so, but we could reasonably expect another five or sixweeks of workable weather. We had worked on Turkey Springs in December andJanuary the previous winter.In an apparent attempt to deceive the public about prior progress on the job,PJK misquoted the Forest Service record to read “working days” instead of“calendar days,” thus eliminating weekends and other normal time-losses from hisdistorted calculations. PJK also misreported that the days elapsed on piling(work that can be three or four times slower than the thinning part of the job)were representative of the progress on the job as a whole. We did most of thepiling and a lot of the thicker areas of the job first, because the other partof the job lay along the main Rim Road, which would be more accessible if badweather came early. What remained was mostly the higher daily-acreage-rate work,the easier, “gravy” portion. That assessment was borne out by the crew whofinished the job.Why would a contractor stick with a job for a year and a half, then drop itweeks from completion? Why would anyone who planned to get out of a job leavethe easiest for last? They’d go cut the easiest parts for a quick payday.Contract time extensions are a common procedure. Every other contractor on theforest has received extensions a number of times. Mike was not facing someimmutable cutoff point with his remaining time. If he had needed more time, hecould have obtained another extension. In fact, another extension was offered tohim after the UFO incident, but Mike declined because by then he had no crew.After what they’d been through with the incident and the murder accusations,none of the men were interested in returning to work in those woods. Fear andthe psychological impact of what they’d been through were deciding factors, plusthe fact that most of them had already made other plans to solve theiremployment problem.PJK has been forced to distort many facts to sustain his scenario. He also hadaccused my mother and brother of helping to carry off the alleged hoax to getMike out of his contract. Although not enemies, neither my brother nor my motherwere very close to Mike. Anyone familiar with their relationship (or lack ofone) would find it laughable that either of them would lie to help Mike. And whywould Dwayne Smith, who had only been working three days, go to such greattrouble for Mike’s sake? Dwayne, Allen, and John had come up from the southernpart of the state, and Ken had come all the way from Mexico to find work. Whywould they become part of an insane plan that would cost them their jobs?If Mike had wanted to get out of his contract, all he would have had to do wassimply walk away from the job and do nothing more. He did not need any wild UFOtale to be released from his contract. The core of PJK’s Forest Service ContractTheory depends on the absurd idea that Mike would believe a standard defaultwould be severely damaging to his reputation with the Forest Service, while adefault due to a report of something so bizarre and popularly ridiculed as a UFOabduction would be well received! Mike certainly wouldn’t have thought either ofthose things. Neither his prior default, nor most of those defaults received byother contractors, had had any catastrophic consequences.Mike’s Turkey Springs contract was defaulted when his crew would not return towork; it cost him money, as any default would, whether or not it had been causedby a UFO incident. Actually it cost him more than a default under ordinarycircumstances. He was never paid for his last four and a half weeks’ work,because he didn’t find out until after the default that the completed acreagefailed inspection—due to searchers having moved and torn apart many of thepiles, looking for my dead body.PJK claimed Mike had seriously underbid the price-per-acre on Turkey Springs. Ofcourse Mike had underbid the other contractors: that was how he had been awardedthe contract. His price was considerably less than the other bidders’, but stillwell above the official Forest Service Estimate. (To provide a general idea ofan acceptable price range, the Forest Service Estimate is established for eachcontract prior to advertising the job for bid, but remains confidential untilafter the opening bid.) Mike has profitably finished many contracts that werebid below the Forest Service’s estimated acre-price.PJK acts as if the dollar-per-acre offered by the highest bidder for the job wasindication of the true worth of work on Turkey Springs. Nonsense. Bidding isopen to all. There are sometimes absurdly low and high bids from novices whocouldn’t tell one end of a chainsaw from the other. Often a variety of factorsdetermine why different bidders with equal performance ability would requiredifferent acre-prices to achieve the same profit margin. For example, if acontractor is located at a great distance from a job, he will add travel andsometimes even crew lodging expenses to his bid, and must take into account thattravel will reduce the amount of actual time his crew will spend on the jobsite. It is also common practice for some contractors, after they get enoughcontracts to stay busy, to throw in inflated bids on every other contract letout for bidding, just in case they get lucky and no other qualified bidder makesit past the selection process.Turkey Springs was the best contract, profitwise, that Mike had ever beenawarded. In fact, it was the highest price-per-acre he had ever received on anyjob he had ever bid in his previous ten years of TSI (Timber Stand Improvement,or “thinning”).PJK makes a big deal out of the one-dollar-per-acre cost of time extensions, asif this were the last straw against Mike’s “already too-low price” of $27.40.(Mike finished Candy Mountain profitably at $11.85 per acre). The contract wasdefaulted and reawarded to another bidder (coming all the way from Luna, NewMexico) at a still lower price-per-acre ($3.40, or nearly 12.5 percent, lowerthan Mike’s!) and finished easily and profitably with a smaller crew in a numberof man-hours not appreciably greater than the two to three weeks Mike hadestimated. With the cost of time extensions, this still would have been at aprice that would have been at least $1.40 per acre higher than the price paid toJohn Hammond, the contractor who did finish it. PJK must have been aware ofthose facts.An example of the kind of progress Mike was actually capable of achieving onTurkey Springs is demonstrated by documentation of work (exclusively on TurkeySprings) completed between August 28, 1974, and September 5, 1974. As documentedby Forest Service Payment Estimate #3 of September 5, 1974, Payment Invoice #3of September 7, 1974, pay stubs, and other instruments, a crew of seven full-and part-time workers put in a total of 210-1/3 man-hours to cut 115 acres inthose 6 working days: 4.4 acres per man per day. The 238 acres remaining afterNovember 1975 was of similar or lesser density, so at that rate it would haveonly taken our six-man crew (with Rogers supervising) nine working days tofinish it. However, since a certain percentage of calendar days inevitably willbe lost to weekends, rain, mechanical breakdowns, and perhaps another day due toan on-the-job injury, it might have taken as many as seventeen calendar daysprofitably to complete the remainder of the Turkey Springs contract: preciselythe midpoint of the offhand estimate Mike gave PJK. Yet the man persisted inbarging ahead with his twisted numbers.(Incidentally, even after deductions of the 10-percent hold-back, etc., forthose six days’ work, Mike was paid $2,772.88—an amount greater than the totalof the 10-percent retention fund ($2,638.00) Mike supposedly was so desperate tobe paid early.)PJK never checked his conclusions with Mike Rogers before publicly advancing hissenseless theory. He has continued to publicize it widely, in total disregard ofthe contrary facts Mike pointed out, and in the face of Forest ServiceContracting Officer Maurice Marchbanks’ statement that: “There was no way suchan alleged hoax could benefit Rogers.” Even Forest Service Contract SupervisorJunior Williams said, “He had no reason—I didn’t see that he had anything togain, as far as his contract was concerned, or anything else, to conjure up astory of this kind.” PJK knew, or had access to, all of the precedingcontract-related information (he had obtained a copy of Mike’s contractingfile), yet does not mention it to his readers.In a July 10, 1976, paper PJK sent to Sheriff Gillespie, he put his ownwords—“UFO-infested area”—in quotation marks to give the false impression thatMike had uttered them in claiming his crew wouldn’t enter such an area to work.In fact, Mike never mentioned the incident in the process of the contract’stermination. PJK also wrote: “Rogers was paid his previously withheld $2,638 byearly 1976 without an outright default.”That was an outright falsehood: There most certainly was an outright default.This untruth was needed as part of PJK’s pretense that there was something aboutthe default following the incident (and more advantageous to Mike) differentfrom a default occurring in the absence of the incident. There was absolutely nosuch difference, as PJK either knew or could have learned. It’s a fact, thatMike never attempted to invoke any “act of God” clause (as Marchbanks confirms)during the default proceedings, which were finalized months prior to PJK’spublicizing his theory. The above is only one of a number of indisputable keyfacts which, even taken singularly, completely refute the “Contract MotiveTheory.”By the way, that figure was correct: $2,638. That’s right; all this sound andfury, PJK’s saying that the “INVESTIGATION REVEALS THAT THERE WAS A MOTIVE, ASTRONG FINANCIAL MOTIVE, FOR ALL OF THEM TO COLLABORATE ON A HOAX,” is referringto a lousy $2,638! This would come to a mere $293.11 for each of nine“conspirators” ($376.85, if you go by the claim of seven conspirators which PJKwas supposedly forced to retreat). Laughable.He alleges this monumental effort was put forth not to gain unearned money, butonly to get already-earned money early. Except that, without the hoax scenario,all that money would have been Mike’s. PJK’s theory is that Mike needed thatentire sum to get him through the winter. People are expected to believe that,just to get it early (which any experienced contractor would know was impossibleanyway and which did not happen), Mike would settle for a seventh or a ninth ofthe original amount. PJK essentially claims that Mike needed only $376.85 (orless) to support himself and his large family for a period of several months.Otherwise, what becomes of PJK’s contract-linked motive for the rest of us sixor eight? You can’t have Mike getting the whole amount to himself to get himthrough the winter, and have his “coconspirators” receive their paltry shares.Either way it’s sliced, it’s a scenario without any sense.The crew was only a few days away from our next payday, and Mike had over amonth’s work he hadn’t yet had inspected for payment. Why would we want to leavethat immediately available money on the table? And, because of the default, mostof the crew didn’t get the pay they would have received that following Fridayuntil over three months later, when the 10 percent was paid in early February.(PJK’s July 20, 1976, paper to Sheriff Gillespie claimed: “After the newcontractor’s bid of $24.00 per acre was received, Rogers was paid his full10-percent retention [$2,638], providing funds to tide him over the winter.”This gave the false impression that payment immediately followed the Novemberdefault, when in fact it came over three months later, after much of the winterweather limiting access to the woods was past.)Some people might get lost in the complexities of PJK’s distortion ofcontractual fine print. Creating such confusion in the casual reader issomething PJK counts heavily on. He takes advantage of the fact that the averageperson unfamiliar with his modus operandi will tend to take him at his word andsuccumb to the false notion that, “If it wasn’t true, he couldn’t say it inprint.” But no one can be fooled by the bottom line. The aforementionedinsignificant dollar amount is all the Forest Service money PJK has ever claimedthere was to be gained. He asks his readers to believe that seven men wouldsubject themselves to great legal risk, loss of their jobs, charges of murder,ridicule, and years of suspicion, for less than $377 each.PJK’s writings are so worded that his readers would be led to assume that heobtained the basis for his erroneous concepts and twisted interpretation ofcontracting procedure through the Turkey Springs contracting officer, MauriceMarchbanks. Marchbanks is as far from prejudiced in the matter as one can be. Hegave PJK his opinion of the incident itself: “I didn’t believe it then, and Idon’t believe it now.”Yet Marchbanks says there is absolutely nothing in the Turkey Springs record orin Forest Service contracting procedure to support PJK’s theory. Period. And hehas been telling PJK so from the beginning, which fact PJK hides from hisreaders.There’s no more authoritative source in the world on the Contract Motive Theorythan Maurice Marchbanks. So, to put the question to rest in irrefutable fashion,Mike Rogers recently sent the retired contracting officer the following letterand questionnaire.January 28, 1993Maurice Marchbanks(address)Logan, New MexicoDear Mr. Marchbanks:As per our telephone conversation a few days ago, I am enclosing a briefquestionnaire as to knowledge you can easily provide to the absurd allegationsmade by the infamous UFO investigator, [PJK].The reason I never took the time or interest to completely refute [PJK's]nonsense before this is because he is really small potatoes in the area of UFOresearch and his books don't sell well enough to reach very many people and mostof those who have read some of his stuff are generally unimpressed with his lackof rationality. The reason I am taking the time to refute [PJK] now is becauseof the quickly approaching release of the movie Fire in the Sky. This majormovie is going to create an all-new interest in our incident and the [PJK]nonsense is bound to come up somewhere along the line.The most lengthy (tiresome—six chapters) of [PJK's] tirades against me is in hisrecent book The Public Deceived, in which his basic scenario boils down to thefollowing: that I wanted out of the Turkey Springs contract long before the UFOincident as he presumes it was a bad contract; that I could quickly obtain my10% retention money if I could get my contract defaulted, that I needed an \"actof God\" excuse to have my contract defaulted, and that I got my six crewmen tohelp me get out of the supposedly bad contract. He also presumes to have provedthat I am capable of producing false stories with his claim that I was dishonestin my dealings with the Forest Service by \"moonlighting\" on other contractsduring the Turkey Springs contract.I know that you find this long line of add-on assumptions to be laughable evenfrom the first as any knowledgeable contracting officer would. You have beenquoted by several reputable investigators as having said that there was no waysuch an alleged hoax could benefit me as far as my contract was concerned. Ialso know that any contracting officer could easily point out the obviousfallacies in every one of [PJK's] assumptions, but you were my contractingofficer at the time of the incident and it is most appropriate that you be theone to help me set the record straight.There is also something else which comes forth in [PJK's] writing which shouldbe of concern to you personally. The twisted and clever way in which [PJK]writes deliberately leads his readers into assuming that he obtained all histotally wrong concepts of Forest Service contracting procedure directly fromyou. I'm sure you don't like being made to look the fool any more than I do.This upcoming new movie will have its written companion, a book which is alsotitled Fire in the Sky. I have been promised that your responses on thequestionnaire will be included in the book in a chapter which will put [PJK] inhis rightful, notorious place. In doing this, we will both have the opportunityto vindicate ourselves completely from the [PJK] trash.It is good to be hearing from you again. I hope your new life of retirement isfilled with the best.Sincerely,Michael H. RogersAnd here is the questionnaire:FOREST SERVICE CONTRACTING OFFICER FOR THE TURKEY SPRINGS CONTRACT OF 1975 ,MAURICE MARCHBANKS, HAS AGREED TO ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS FOR THE RECORD:1. Is it necessary for a contractor to provide an “act of God” excuse to acontracting officer before the Forest Service can proceed with a termination ofthat contract for default?Answer: NO2. Is it necessary for a contractor to provide any excuse to a contractingofficer before the Forest Service can proceed with a termination of thatcontract for default?Answer: NO3. Assuming that Rogers did want out of his Turkey Springs contract, viatermination for default, is it true that Rogers could have easily accomplishedthis at any time by simply walking off the job and not coming back?Answer: YES4. Was it your normal course of action, after a contract had been defaulted,that the Forest Service would readvertise that contract for new bids and thatthe original contractor would only receive his 10 percent retention money if thenew low bid was equal to or lower than the original bid price, and only thenwould the original contractor receive that money after the entire process wascomplete (a process not uncommon to last four months or more) and only thenafter the additional time needed for the check to be processed and sent?Answer: YES5. Would you consider it to be “dishonest” or “deception” if a contractor ofyours had other working contracts, other than the one held with you, even if youwere not personally aware of those other jobs?Answer: NO6. Is it true that [PJK] called and talked to you upwards of ten times duringthe year of 1976 and that you grew quite weary of his persistent hectoring?Answer: YES7. Is it your honest appraisal of the real situation on the Turkey Springscontract that Rogers had nothing to gain by a UFO story as far as his contractwas concerned?Answer: YESsigned Maurice Marchbanks, February 5, 1993So there it is. No need for a crash course in complex contract law. No need togo into PJK’s obscure, convoluted hypothesizing. No need to go into all themultitude of little tricks he used: the partial quotes, the distortions, cleveromissions, self-contradictions, or even his misuse of excerpts from writtencontract documents. Each of PJK’s basic Forest Service Contract Motive Theoryclaims are here, each totally and succinctly refuted.Marchbanks, a skeptic about the UFO incident itself, has nothing to gain fromcalling it as he sees it. But if his facts were not in line with what every oneof his many other contracting-officer peers know, it would tarnish the honorablerecord of his long and respectable career.Mike has returned to logging and contracts TSI from the Forest Service,maintaining an excellent reputation with them to this day. Recently, in 1992,Mike’s situation was fairly typical, and similar to his contracting situationback in 1975. He had three contracts running simultaneously, received a timeextension on each of the three, even a second time extension on one of thecontracts—normal operating procedures, not “delinquent,” not “moonlighting.” Allwere completed satisfactorily. His present contracting officer, Violet Mills,considers him one of the better contractors now operating in those woods.PJK’s attack on the Turkey Springs incident is a real scattergun assault.Outside of character assassination, he stakes the core of his campaign on twothings: the confabulated contract theory we just put out of its misery, and hishyped-up version of my initial encounter with a polygraph examiner. If you thinkthe contract theory has been blown completely out of the water, wait till yousee the McCarthy “test” hype go down in flames.PJK appears to regard his “theory” of the thinning contract as the crowningachievement of his investigation. Without it, he might have considered theMcCarthy polygraph experiment his “case breaker,” except for the fact thatpublic knowledge of my complete success in passing another polygraph testpreceded his “revelation.”However, PJK’s pride notwithstanding, the public seemed less impressed with hisconvoluted “contract theory” concoction than with my “failed” test. That “test”was so incredibly flawed that a number of highly regarded polygraph examinersinvalidated it solely on the basis of the transcript of a tape of it, withoutneeding to examine the actual charts. As a matter of fact, I’ll wager onecouldn’t find a single reputable polygraph examiner who, after reading thefollowing analysis of the many fundamental errors in that “test,” would bewilling to stake his reputation on upholding its propriety.First, a basic sketch of the underlying principles of the polygraph. In thatpursuit I will quote from testimony given before the United States House ofRepresentatives’ Committee on Government Operations from the 93rd Congress, onJune 4, 1974, concerning “The Use of Polygraphs and Similar Devices by FederalAgencies.”Testimony quoted is from Cleve Backster, Director of the Backster School of LieDetection. Mr. Backster is recognized as one of the top experts in the world inhis field, with forty-five years of experience. He has served as trainingdirector for scores of advanced-work conferences and seminars, and for more than140 basic polygraph-examiner training courses, administered chiefly to lawenforcement personnel at the state and municipal level. He has worked as aninterrogation instructor in the U.S. Army Counterintelligence Corps, as aninterrogation specialist with the CIA, and been a guest instructor at FortGordon, the U.S. Department of Defense Polygraph School, the Canadian PoliceCollege Polygraph Examiner School, and the FBI Academy. He has held numeroushigh-ranking posts in polygraph professional associations, and made majorcontributions to his field, with achievements in basic scientific research onpolygraphy and improvements in procedure adopted throughout the field. Mr.Backster had also testified before Congress as an expert witness ten yearsearlier, in 1964. An excerpt from his 1974 testimony reads as follows.Of utmost importance in a polygraph examination is the psychophysiological chainof events occurring in response to a strong relevant question. For example,during deception:1. Subject answers the polygraph, examiner's relevant question with a lie.2. The lie stimulates the fear of detection of deception.3. The fear of the detection of deception stimulates a variety ofpsychophysiological changes within the subject's body.4. Certain of these psychophysiological changes are recorded upon a movingchart.5. The polygraph examiner then evaluates the relevant question reaction.The procedure stated, thus far, brings up an important consideration. Can thepolygraph examiner safely identify one emotion from another by merely looking ata relevant question reaction on a polygraph chart? It is my belief that theanswer is that he cannot—with any degree of consistency.It is extremely important that this problem be overcome by the use of acarefully structured procedure that is designed to allow the examiner to isolatenot only “fear” as the emotion involved, but also to distinguish “fear of thedetection of deception” from the other varieties of “fear.”The principal solution in most modern polygraph techniques, regardless of minorvariations, is the use of a carefully structured and reviewed control-questionprocedure.At times polygraph evidence pertaining to our experience has been unfairlycriticized for the examiners’ wording their conclusions to state that the testedperson “believed” such-and-such to be the case; which, the scoffers point out,doesn’t necessarily mean that it was so. Nevertheless, there is nothingtentative about such conclusions. The limit of what can be inferred frompolygraph-equipment measurements is whether or not the subject believes he orshe is telling the truth. But this is quite sufficient.Admittedly, if you believed you could fly, a polygraph would confirm yourbelief, and only something such as successful arm-flapping could confirm thereality of what you believed. Ultimately you have to acknowledge that anytimeyou speak the truth, it is the truth as you know it, as you believe it to be.We’re human, so who could ask for more than that when you ask a person for thetruth?The McCarthy test experiment was attempted only a few days after my return, whenI was still in a deeply anxious state. My condition was so serious that APROpersonnel had already advised me, as they subsequently stated in a November 14,1975, press release, to delay taking a test from the state police examiner untilI had recovered. But APRO’s investigation was being bankrolled by the NationalEnquirer, and the Enquirer's principal concern was to gain precedence over theother media. They were not inclined to wait even one day if it might jeopardizetheir scoop.APRO’s Dr. James Harder warned the Enquirer crew and the examiner John McCarthy(in the presence of witnesses) at great length that I was in no condition to betested. The Enquirer crew leader, Paul Jenkins, pressed, arguing there wasnothing to lose because the test would be given in strict confidence and theresults wouldn’t be released without my permission. APRO finally agreed to atest as an experiment, a gauge of my condition. If it turned out well, theywould publicize it, but if it went as Dr. Harder predicted, they would forgetthe test and write their account without it.When the test yielded stressful readings, as Dr. Harder had warned, McCarthyreneged on his assurance that he would take my devastated psychologicalcondition into consideration. He was plainly quite angry at having his opinionoverridden by other experts. Having my brother Duane tell McCarthy to his facein explicit language what he thought of McCarthy’s reversal must havecontributed greatly to McCarthy’s subsequent attitudes and actions.PJK made a big deal out of the fact that the test was kept secret. But there wasno sinister cover-up. McCarthy had agreed to absolute confidentiality on thephone before the test, before he’d even seen me. The condition ofconfidentiality was made partly to maintain the Enquirer's exclusive, but was inanticipation of confirmation that I was not yet sufficiently recovered to betestable.I have never in my entire life been in such a desperate mental state, eitherbefore or after. I was in a constant state of terror. In spite of what was goingon inside, I struggled to present coherent behavior, not always successfully.APRO director Jim Lorenzen: “. . . Travis’ demeanor at the time resembled thatof a caged bobcat. He seemed to be poised for flight even though he was lying ina semireclining position . . .” Psychiatrist Dr. Jean Rosenbaum: . . . this is aperson who has been going through a . . . life crisis... , for example, a deathor divorce. .. .” And, “he was like a wild animal in a cage.” Reporter Jeff Wells: “Our firstsight of the kid was at dinner in the motel dining room that night. It was ashock. He sat there mute, pale, twitching like a cornered animal.” Interestinghow they were all moved separately to use a similar metaphor.I was even struggling with my grip on reality at times. One theory SheriffGillespie was pushing was that my coworkers had slipped me drugs, hit me on thehead, and put on masks or something to guide my “trip.” I was aware that thepress had been speculating wildly in search of alternative explanations for theentire incident.My own resistance to accepting what my memories were telling me had me lookingfor a way out myself. McCarthy only made things worse. He referred to thealcohol-influenced, drug-hallucination angle. He asked if I had been“hypnotized,” “programmed to forget”—if maybe I had really been in a “hospital”or “building” somewhere. I was asking myself, had my mind slipped a cog?McCarthy was nurturing my seeds of doubt and planting some of his own in themidst of my temporary reality-testing. During the first few days of this mostcritical period of adjusting to the reality of what I’d been through, I was cutoff from the reassurance of the corroboration of my crewmates, who had also seenwhat I had.American Polygraph Association members agree to abide by nineteen minimumguidelines of performance, titled Standards and Principles of Practice. StandardNumber 4 requires that “A member shall not conduct an examination of any personwhom the member believes to be physically or emotionally unsuitable fortesting.”I had heard about the uproar, before Cy Gilson’s tests of my crewmates inSheriff Gillespie’s office, over the suspicion of a government cover-up. AllenDalis’ inconclusive test had me wondering. Government hush-ups had long been abasic belief with ufologist organizations like APRO; they did nothing to lessenmy misgivings. I had quite an inner dialogue running back and forth about this,some of my thoughts uttered aloud and captured on tape. (I have a clear tape ofthe entire pretest interview and test proceedings, and a complete transcript,without the omissions and errors of the transcript published by APRO. Keep inmind when reading quotations here or any references to what happened during thetest that I am prepared to document each of them precisely.)McCarthy’s condescending, sarcastic, and hostile attitude was only the beginningof the ordeal. My alarm bells were going off constantly. He tried to put wordsin my mouth; he’d tell me how I felt instead of asking me. He wouldn’t let mefinish, interrupting me twenty-eight times during those scant ninety minutes. Isaw the situation developing, but felt trapped.When he told me Dr. Harder had told him I was fine, I figured he was lying sinceI had just discussed my condition with Dr. Harder and heard his remarks to theothers. He made me sign a consent/waiver form, over my objections that thestatement acknowledged certain things had occurred which had not. I was badlydisoriented as to time, but McCarthy spent over five minutes hazing me abouttime and dates, at one point snapping: “Where have you been, in a vacuum?” Yethe stated in his report that I was “lucid.”A polygraph examiner is not supposed to antagonize or deliberately upset a testsubject. He is supposed to create a calm, neutral atmosphere so that the subjectreacts to the questions, not to any other agitating stimulus. To be so negativein the pretest reveals more than the absence of proper technique; it exposes astrong bias. A recognized text of polygraphy, Psychological Methods in CriminalInvestigation and Evidence, states in chapter 8, “Polygraph Techniques for theDetection of Deception”: “It is critical that the polygraph examiner’s demeanorand behavior be professional and objective. If the subject is suspicious of theexaminer or feels that the examiner is not competent or is biased, the accuracyof the test is compromised. Some examiners are psychologically insensitive andabusive, and they sometimes convey an impression of disbelief in the subject’sversion of the events or attempt to interrogate the subject prior to thecompletion of the test. Such behaviors on the part of the examiner are likely toincrease the risk of a false positive error.” (“False positive” means judging atruthful person as deceptive.)Dr. David C. Raskin, author of the passage quoted above, is a professor ofpsychology at the University of Utah, and author or coauthor of many respectedtexts. He has performed scientific research on polygraphy and publishedrecognized papers on his widely adopted innovations in the refinement oftechnique. Dr. Raskin has twenty-three years’ experience in polygraphy, and is afrequently consulted, court-recognized expert in the U.S. and Canada. He hasbeen involved in well-known cases such as the Howard Hughes will, Jeffrey (FatalVision) McDonald, serial killer Ted Bundy, the DeLorean affair, and the McMartinpreschool spectacle. As an internationally known expert, Dr. Raskin hastestified before British Parliament, the Israeli Kineset, and the JudiciaryCommittee of the U.S. Senate—having been called in by the latter four times,with regard to cases including Watergate and Iran-Contra.The Spring 1990 issue of the CSICOP journal PJK edits, the Skeptical Inquirer,published an article critical of the polygraph, by Elie A. Shneour, called(appropriately) “Lying About Polygraph Tests.” I could get quotations similar tothe following from many other sources, but these, coming from PJK’s own outfit,are hardest for PJK to deny. Shneour says: “Although few examiners will admitit, a good judge of human behavior will override the polygraph charts andgenerate a report that is more heavily weighed by the examiner’s own perceptionof the subject.” And certainly a poor judge of human behavior would be justas—if not more—prone to such departure from objective measurement.The CSICOP article goes on: “The central premise of polygraph testing, thepsychological assumption that guilt can always be inferred from emotionaldisturbance, is considered to be implausible by the majority of knowledgeablepsychologists in the field.” While this comment acknowledges that there are manymental states other than deception that can produce stressful polygraph charts,it is not true that polygraph examiners act under a premise which ignores thatfact, as evidenced by Backster’s congressional testimony. In fact, a great partof their training and methodology is directed solely at making certain they knowthe category of stimulus for any emotional disturbance recorded on their charts,and to avoid getting certain categories entirely. That was one of several areaswhere John J. McCarthy failed miserably.Let’s look again at the last part of the excerpt of congressional testimony Iquoted above: “It is extremely important... to distinguish ‘fear of thedetection of deception’ from the other varieties of ‘fear.’ The principalsolution in most modern polygraph techniques, regardless of minor variations, isthe use of a carefully structured and reviewed control-question procedure.” Theconcept of control-question tests (CQTs) was introduced in 1939 and refined in1947. In 1974 CQTs were considered (and still are) the accepted moderntechnique. (The state police polygraph examiner, Cy Gilson, used CQT on the sixwitnesses.)However, McCarthy was still using a straight “relevant/irrelevant” test method,considered over twenty-seven years out of date even in 1975! This type of testhas generated as high as 80 percent false positives in controlled test researchwhere verification was independently certain. The straight relevant/irrelevanttest can be worse than worthless—it violates some states’ regulations governingthe use of polygraphs. In states where polygraph results are admissible evidencein court, such as New Mexico, this method is not admissible. It is prohibitedprocedure in Nevada, where they use Backster Zone of Comparison methodology inconjunction with (as their manual specifies) CQT methodology. In Utah anexaminer could lose his license for using the relevant/irrelevant method withoutspecial prior approval (which has never before been requested or granted). TheUtah Department of Public Safety Bureau of Regulatory Licensing says,“Irrelevant and relevant tests without controls will not be recognized by theBureau as approved techniques.” I didn’t personally verify the fact, as I didfor all states bordering Arizona, but I’ve been told by experts that the samesituation concerning methodology prevails throughout the rest of the country.The reason people were getting away with not updating their training and stillusing the simpler, old “relevant/irrelevant” method in Arizona, when it isprohibited in all the surrounding states, is that in 1975 Arizona had noofficial licensing or regulation of the profession.PJK tried to point to McCarthy’s application of the so-called “stim test,” whichhe did between his two runs through the questions, as being proof of mysuitability for testing. The stim test consists of the examiner unerringlyidentifying (supposedly by use of the chart tracings) a card “secretly” chosenby the subject, to convince the subject of the infallibility of the machine.Since the stim test (which Shneour’s Skeptical Inquirer article so criticizes)often relies on deception on the part of the examiner (as prescribed by themethod’s school), using marked cards, most modern examiners reject thetechnique. Although I cannot show that McCarthy rigged the stim test, it issuspicious that he didn’t actually show me the chart that supposedly gave himhis answer. To legitimate the assay he should have done so to reinforce theeffect.This old method’s reliance on trickery has led some people to assume erroneouslythat modern polygraphy depends on bluff for its success, and that simply seeingthrough this will allow people to beat the test. On the contrary, I’m quitecertain that modern methods (sans stim test) could easily determine the amountof change in your pocket, if you knew it yourself, to the penny, without theexaminer knowing the sum in advance.None of the studies claiming to support the accuracy of the relevant/irrelevanttest in field applications meets the reasonable scientific standards forinternal or external validity set by the government’s Office of TechnologyAssessment.Most of the criticism of the reliability of polygraph in general is actually dueto the obsolete relevant/irrelevant methodology. Misconceptions such as thosecontained in the CSICOP article come in large part from practices that are nowno longer used. But, since its information applies to my archaic “test,” I’llquote again from the article PJK’s crony wrote: “But the ultimate irony lies inthe well-established observation that polygraph examinations tend to err ongenerating substantially more false positive than false negatives. This meansthat truthful persons incriminated as liars by the polygraph will outnumberactual liars.” This was seconded by Scott Lilienfeld in the Fall 1993 SkepticalInquirer. “. . . the polygraph typically yields a high rate of false positives.”(That article also pointed out the portion of false positives that paradoxicallyincludes “excessively guilt-prone individuals, who are probably among the leastlikely of all people to prevaricate”; and decried the prospect that we might“penalize particularly moral individuals, many of whom may be the‘guilt-grabbers’ erroneously detected by the polygraph test.”You won’t hear PJK making use of the above knowledge because it overturns hisposition on my case. His tunnel vision on “lie detectors” (being an extremereverse of what research has shown) is that failed tests concerning UFOs arealways flawless; passed tests on the subject can never be right.I didn’t defend myself with the above information in my book in 1977 because Iwasn’t aware of it then. All I knew was that McCarthy wasn’t right. In fact, Ididn’t discover most of this material until after I passed the last polygraphtests I’ll ever take on this subject, in 1993. (See chapter 11.)Modern polygraph testing has become an extremely refined science, replete withhighly technical terms I don’t completely understand: climax damping, doublecross-validation, zone of comparison (ZOC), electrodermal burst frequency, peakof tension (POT), and “vasomotor univariate point-bisarial correlations.”The reliability and sensitivity of modern equipment is also vastly improved.Besides using a completely discredited method, John McCarthy was using an earlythree-trace polygraph machine. It used the unreliable, old-style fingerpaddle,passive galvanic system, a glitch-prone method which simply measuresfluctuations in skin conductivity. Modern equipment utilizes a steadymicrocurrent through the hand which gives a constant reference baseline ofcomparison, eliminating spurious conductivity changes.(Compared with my other tests, McCarthy spent a lot of time fussing withattaching the galvanic terminals to me, the wires to which had noticeably frayedinsulation. He adjusted, readjusted, and fretted about my exact hand position.At one point on the tape he exclaimed aloud in angry frustration: “I can’t getthis thing ... I can’t get the instrument tuned in to you if you keep jumpingaround in the chair!” I apologized, but I didn’t think I’d been moving at all.Part of the APA Standards and Principles of Practice reads: “A member shall notknowingly conduct an examination using any instrument which at the time of theexamination is not functioning properly as designed.”I’ve learned that the construction of McCarthy’s machine required that the airin the blood-pressure cuff directly, physically, move the chart needle. Thatdesign yielded much less sensitivity and required higher pressures, thereforegreatly increasing the discomfort on the subject’s arm (which also raises thoseunwanted extraneous stress levels). I complained of the pain it was causing in arecent injury inflicted to my elbow in a sparring match with my karateinstructor, but McCarthy brushed my complaint aside. Pain, like stress, canregister on the charts and further confuse an appraisal.Who was this relic McCarthy, anyway? PJK touts him as “the most experienced andone of the most respected polygraph examiners in Arizona.” I’ve uncoveredinformation indicating he was probably neither. For one thing, he wasn’t even amember of the Arizona Polygraph Association. One might guess why he might wantto distance himself from knowledgeable examiners from what follows.On the tape of the pretest interview, McCarthy claims to have had twenty-fiveyears of experience. On KOOL-TV’s August 12, 1976, Face the State, he said hehad fifteen years’ experience. The NICAP Bulletin wrote he was first licensed inIllinois in 1964, which, without prior unlicensed experience, would give himeleven years at that time. PJK read the test and pretest transcript with its“twenty-five years” claim. Yet even he embellished his boast of McCarthy’s being“the most experienced examiner in the state of Arizona,” only to the extent ofclaiming McCarthy had “nearly twenty” years of experience at the time of thetest. Later PJK changed that claim to “for nearly twenty years he . . .practiced in Phoenix.” Twenty-five, fifteen, eleven, nearly twenty total, ortwenty in Phoenix alone—which is it? Why the inconsistencies?Figuring McCarthy wouldn’t be any more forthright with me than he had been inthe past, in 1993 I asked Mike Rogers to telephone McCarthy and ask him directlyabout the matter to see if he could get a straight answer. Mike told McCarthywho he was, about the film Fire in the Sky coming out soon, and that he wantedto nail down some facts, to be completely accurate. From the start McCarthybacktracked and hedged:Mike: . . . the only thing we can find for your earliest licensing is Illinoisin 1964.JMc: Um-hm.MR: Were you licensed or practicing prior to that?JMc: No. Illinois was my first, uh, uh, license. When Illinois got the licensinglaw, I applied and got, obtained, one of their licenses.MR: So that was your first—that’s when you first started practice, then?JMc: No, no, not when I first started practicing. I first started practicing in1949. MR Okay.JMc: In C.I.D.MR: What is C.I.D.?JMc: Criminal Investigation Division—MR: Is this in the military? [both speaking]JMc: Of the army, [both speaking]MR: Oh, the military, okay.JMc: Uh-huh, right.MR: Yeah, that was what I was trying to find out, okay. Uh, I think that’s all Ihave here. Now in this military, even though that wasn’t private practice, thatwas actual polygraph practice? That wasn't your training or anything like that,was it?JMc: It was all criminal work.MR: Okay. Okay, but “It wasn't training? ” is what I’m trying to say.JMc: Training?MR: Yeah, training.JMc: Nope. That’s uh—MR: When, do you know, do you remember, when you received your training? Iunderstand that was at Fort Gordon or something.JMc: That’s right. It was at Fort Gordon.MR: Do you remember the years on that?JMc: Ahh, I think that was, um, uh, ’50.MR: 1950?JMc: ’Fifty, I believe, yeah.MR: Just the one year, 1950?JMc: Yeah, right.Mike then mentioned the movie, the need for accurate dates, and the fact thatthis information might be used in a book of the same title as the movie. ThenMike said: “So you say that you were—Oh, I just noticed something here. Youmight have these years backwards. You said you were actually in practice in1949, and you said you got your schooling in 1950.”JMc: No, that’s not—I was not actually in practice in, in, at that time in ’49and ’50 and those years, I was commander of a Criminal Investigation Detachmentand we, uh, obtained the first polygraph examiner, uh, with his equipment in thearea of jurisdiction that we covered at that time. And, uh, so we sorta got OJTjust like every other piece of equipment in the detachment. I, uh, wanted tofamiliarize myself with it so I knew, uh, what was goin’ on, just like you, uh—MR: Okay.JMc: Uh, recording equipment, uh, wiretap equipment, uh, fingerprint, uh,latent-fingerprint-lifting equipment, photography, the use of the speed graphicthat was, uh, uh, you know, operational at that time. So my, my interest wasgetting to know everything that I—was in my outfit.MR: Okay, well I guess the precise question is, when did you actually receiveyour own personal schooling on the polygraph?JMc: Uh, let me see. [aside] When did I go to polygraph school, do you remember?Hm? [background voice: “ ’Fifty-eight”] ’fifty... [then, to Mike] I don’t knowit was someplace in the late fifties.MR: Late fifties?JMc: Yeah, somewhere around there.MR: Okay, okay, so, see, the question I’m asking is not “When did you firstbecome familiar with it and start working with it in your department? ” but“When did you personally get your schooling and when did you first actuallystart using a polygraph as a schooled polygraph examiner? ”JMc: Uh, oh yeah, I know when it was now, that was when we were at Huachuca. Um,it was fifty-seven.MR: [simultaneously] Okay, you first, uh, okay, fifty-seven is when you receivedyour schooling?JMc: [simultaneously] ’Fifty-seven is when I went to school. Um-hm. ’Fifty-sevento fifty-eight, my wife says.MR: ’Fifty-seven to fifty-eight. Okay, did you start actually practicingpolygraph in the military after 1958?JMc: Yes. Um-hmm.MR: Okay, so then you could say that you’ve been in actual practice as aschooled examiner since 1958.JMc: Right.MR: Okay, all right, I just wanted to make certain of that. Uh, I guess that’sall I have, so I really appreciate your talking to me.People who presume to undertake the business of separating truth from fictionought to be scrupulous in their own statements. On Face The State, McCarthy madeseveral untrue statements. He claimed my brother Duane bodily threw him out ofthe hotel where the APRO/Enquirer investigation was taking place. There weremany witnesses to his departure, and Duane never touched him. McCarthy alsoclaimed on the show that during the pretest interview I told him that I, mybrother, and mother had often speculated about riding in UFOs.PJK repeats those charges in his writings, despite having read the transcript ofthe pretest interview and therefore knowing the claim to be false. Nowhere inthe tape (which is the total of my words with McCarthy other than on “Face TheState”) did I refer to a belief in UFOs by anyone else in my family. And, incomplete contradiction of McCarthy’s and PJK’s claims, I absolutely did not sayon that tape that I’d “often” thought of riding in a UFO. Quite the contrary.McCarthy brought up this question entirely on his own, apparently coming intothe situation prejudiced by false rumors he’d heard in the news media. (For PJKit is quite a routine tactic to change “ever” to “often,” “some” to “all,” etc.)I did explain to McCarthy, attempting to be absolutely accurate in response to aquestion of “ever” thinking of such a thing, that seeing something on TV makesthe viewer, in a sense, live the filmmaker’s fantasy. (Again, I don’t thinkanyone in our society could claim they’d never seen such images.) But in spiteof his badgering on this issue, I answered, “It was no burning desire, nothingI’ve thought about at all.” He pressed on: “You never thought of riding in aUFO?” I answered: “No.”By pressuring me on that point he got me to change my answer several times inthe course of the pretest talk, due to my effort to be absolutely accurate. But,my condition being what it was and having hardly slept in days, I was confusedby his emphasizing the absolute term “ever” but his manner suggested he wasseeking to interpret it as an obsession or fixation. He got me so confused aboutthis question I actually answered no on the first test chart and yes on thesecond chart! Such a discrepancy would invalidate the question (and thereforethe entire test) for an examiner going by accepted procedure. Yet McCarthy (who,PJK said, specified that as the only relevant question I answered truthfully)didn’t appear to have noticed I had given opposite replies to the same question.The American Polygraph Association’s Standards and Principles of Practice itemNumber 5 states: “A member shall not provide a conclusive decision or reportbased on chart analysis without having collected at least two (2) separatecharts in which each relevant question is asked on each chart. (A chart is onepresentation of the question list.)”I reason that if McCarthy had really looked at the charts he would have caughtthe mistake, since there would have been contradictory tracings. And if thereweren’t contradictory tracings the charts would have been either both truthful,which would invalidate the question (by showing my confusion) and therefore theentire test (good examiners will always toss such a tainted series and startfresh—APA Standards require it); or both stressful, which would invalidate thetest as a clear demonstration of stress reactions to both truth and untruth.It’s one thing for APRO’s volunteers who prepared their version of thetranscript from poor-quality equipment to have missed that compromisingdiscrepancy; but I thought it too incredible that a present polygraph “expert”who was actually present could miss something so obvious as differing answers tothe same question. I at first believed McCarthy had overlooked this, perhapsbecause the charts were nothing but an unreadable mass of generalized stressreactions and he hadn’t based his conclusion on the charts at all. Then Inoticed something peculiar. Of the eight relevant questions, that is the onlyone McCarthy didn’t list or make any reference to in his written report.This led me to notice another irregularity. PJK (referring to what he saidMcCarthy told him) wrote of the question: “In the past, have you ever thought ofriding in a UFO? “Travis answered: ‘Yes’. The resulting polygraph chartindicated that Travis was being truthful.”Note that PJK said “chart”—in the singular! I could find no other place in anyof his writings where polygraph “charts'” were referred to in the singular. DoesPJK share McCarthy’s knowledge of a test-invalidating blunder?Accepted modern polygraph procedure requires a minimum of three charts duringspecific examinations. Some examiners consider two runs adequate on anonspecific test concerning routine matters such as a preemployment clearance,but the better examiners consider even this to be substandard. No question couldpossibly be considered validly determined by a single chart; APA’s Standards andPrinciples of Practice forbids it. The state police tests on the six witnessesin my case were CQTs and were three, and in some cases four, charts long. That’sa minimum of three separate runs through the questions. Three runs are requiredby regulators in states like New Mexico and Utah, which also require a minimum20-second interval between the end of one question and the beginning of thenext.McCarthy ran only two charts on me, and none of his time intervals were as longas 20 seconds; they averaged only 14 seconds, going as low as 10 seconds. Fortwo runs of 12 questions, McCarthy spent a mere 7 minutes on my charts—a testboth PJK and CSICOP tried to hype by labeling it as “lengthy.” Seven minutes outof a total of less than 88 minutes for the entire interview and test,interruptions included. It’s a small point but the regulations in Utah requiretests to be at least 90 minutes long. So, “lengthy\"? (McCarthy’s report claimsthat “the examination commenced at 1425 and was concluded at 1615 hours,” whichwould have made it ten minutes short of two hours in length. The tapeconclusively proves that simply was not the case. But hey, if you’re going tograb your verdict out of thin air, why not the time span, too?)McCarthy asked three “relevant” questions which required me to answer on thebasis of assumption or speculation rather than direct personal knowledge. Thisis considered a very basic and serious error by polygraph operators.Psychological Methods in Criminal Investigation and Evidence states, “Anyrelevant question that is ambiguous or that requires the subject to makeinterpretations can cause problems in drawing inferences about truth ordeception, regardless of the actual guilt or innocence of the person tested.”My tendency to give literal responses stems from what Jim Lorenzen referred toas “philosopher syndrome.” Readers have commented on the curiously sparse use ofmetaphors in my first book, The Walton Experience (which I try to remedy in thisone). In my recent college philosophy class we had discussed all thosenature-of-reality concepts: Cogito ergo sum—if a tree falls in the forest and noone hears it, does it make a sound? Etcetera. My interest in martial arts had methinking about an episode of Kung Fu in which Master Po asks Caine, “If I fallasleep and dream I am a butterfly, how can I be certain when I awake that I amnot a butterfly dreaming I am a man?” Prior to the incident our woods crew hadhad several rap sessions during break time on the job about such ideas.The three questions about which I had no direct perceptual knowledge were (1)Was I actually in a spacecraft? (2) Was I actually taken aboard? and (3) Was Iactually somewhere in Arizona during the five days I was missing? I toldMcCarthy: “All I can say is, to the best of my knowledge I assume that’s what itwas. I can only tell you what I saw; I can’t say it was a spacecraft.” I hadn’teven been conscious, either going in or out, and I was saying that I did notknow where I had been. I also said, “Now I’m going to answer them the way I seeit, because you know if you ask me if I know for sure that some something—I’lltell you what I perceive. And I’ll say yes to those kinds of—If you say, do youknow positively that what this was, was what it appeared to be? I can’t answerquestions like that, but I will.” My condition kept me from being very coherent,but these statements should have been a red flag for the need to clarifyquestions. But McCarthy just passed it by.McCarthy falsely claimed in his report that I had stated I could answer eachquestion with a yes or no. It is critical to proper testing that suchunderstanding be clearly established. The tape distinctly shows I never madesuch a statement. As a matter of fact, the telephone rang at that point in thepretest; there was an interruption, with people coming into the testing room.That key element was skipped on resuming the pretest interview.A polygraph examiner must take into account individual physiologicaldifferences. I have had a nurse take my pulse and comment in amazement on theslowness of my resting pulse. She asked if I was some kind of pro athlete. Itold her not really, but that hard work at high altitude can condition one in asimilar manner. The relevancy to my polygraph test is that if the examinerdoesn’t know the examinee normally has a low resting pulse rate, he will beunable to note the significance of an elevated pulse rate caused by generalagitation. There is something else atypical about my cardiorespiratory system,which may result from a high degree of conditioning. I have a low restingrespiratory rate, and sometimes skip a breath or two when physically inactive.Also at such times I sigh frequently, usually following a breathing lapse.McCarthy claimed in his final report that I “was deliberately attempting todistort” my respiration pattern. If he really referred to the charts at all inrendering his verdict, I believe he had merely detected my respiratory quirk. Mysighs are clearly audible throughout the tape, even in the test portion (but donot bear any relation—negatively or positively—to statements germane to theissue in question).In any event, why would anyone distort their breathing if they were trying todefeat a test? Wouldn’t normal breathing be the desired thing? I was bewilderedby McCarthy’s claim and thought it must be a fabrication. Then APRO’s JimLorenzen noticed my breathing peculiarity and pointed it out to others beforetelling me about it. Lorenzen observed: “I have noticed the respiratory pausethat Travis has. I have one, too, more pronounced if I’m nervous. It’s as thoughI forget to breathe.” Several interviewers noticed it as well, and one observedthat “a year after Travis was unhooked from McCarthy’s polygraph machine, he wasstill doing it.”McCarthy’s biggest error was a blatant violation of one of the most fundamentalprinciples of the polygraph profession; the violation was so overt that it isalmost impossible to believe anyone with any training at all could do such athing unintentionally: He created a strong mental link between the number-onekey question on the test and the single most guilt-ridden memory of my life. Hehad to know better, because elaborate precautions are woven into the entiremethodology in the effort to avoid the very problem of inadvertently provokingresponses stimulated by such extraneous issues. (Even though many might think myearly misdeed relatively minor, I won’t specify it here, thereby serving PJK’sends by further disseminating it.)During the interview McCarthy pushed persistently (for ten minutes—longer thanthe test itself) into areas in my past over which I held deep regrets andlingering guilt. On the tape he claimed this probing as merely “background” forirrelevant questions. However, there wasn’t a single question based on thatmaterial. I’ve learned that some examiners might use such information(especially on a CQT, which this wasn’t) to know what to be careful to avoidbringing up, but McCarthy had used it for an apparently opposite purpose.The central question of the entire test, the one he referred to in hisconclusion, was first asked in the pretest interview: “Have you acted incollusion with others to perpetrate a UFO hoax?”I answered: “No.”Then McCarthy said: “Do you know what I mean when I say ‘Have you acted incollusion with somebody?’ ”I said, “No. What does collusion mean? Abnormal?”McCarthy: “No, no. That means acting in concert with somebody else, one or morepeople to perpetrate a hoax, you know.”I understood and said, “Okay.” If McCarthy had stopped there, he’d have remainedwithin proper procedure with this particular question.But he added: “Acting in collusion with somebody else, you know, to set thisthing up. Just like you acted in collusion with this friend of yours to [blank,blank, and blank], right? That’s collusion, ’cause you’re acting in concert withsomebody else. Now, have you acted in collusion with others, either one or morepeople—others—to perpetrate a UFO hoax?”I had asked for the meaning of an unfamiliar word in the key question of thetest, and he defined it solely in terms of what he knew was the one thingconcerning which I felt the very greatest shame and guilt. What I had done mightbe far from the worst thing a person could do, but it had been my worst. He wasin effect saying: “Now, when you hear this new word, collusion, I want you torecall the worst wrong you’ve ever done in your life.” At that point he couldhave asked me if I had acted in collusion to have breakfast that morning andobtained a powerful reaction—whether I answered yes or no! How could he not knowthis, if he’s really had polygraph training? It appears almost contrived, justtoo much of a direct contradiction of one of the most basic tenets of polygraphyto be an accident. In between the two runs through the questions I toldMcCarthy: “My mind wandered to something that was upsetting me.” He just brushedmy remark aside.PJK boasts that prior to my case he had “acquired some understanding of the useof the polygraph.” Yet the “collusion” passage of the transcript I quoted aboveis nonchalantly quoted in his book with nary a raised brow. The obvious reasonhe chose to repeat the passage was the opportunity to gratuitously recite, fortheir ad hominem effect, the references to my misdeed from years before.To get me to talk, McCarthy had assured me of confidentiality; then he was veryevasive when I asked twice more about confidentiality, when he kept dwelling onmy past mistakes. Talk about creating an atmosphere of distrust! However, if Ihad been someone who thought he could lie through a polygraph test, why would Ihave provided any information about my past misdeeds? I had no criminal record;there was no way he could know of the other, more minor things unless I toldhim. He was simply taking advantage of my efforts to be completely honest withhim.An examiner is not supposed to ask any unreviewed questions or change thewording (or even the order) of any test questions once they are reviewed withthe subject, not even the irrelevant questions. This is partly to enhance somekind of “anticipation effect” for possible “guilty knowledge” items; anotherreason is to avoid introducing the possibility of eliciting a surprised responsethat would be mistaken for deception.McCarthy changed one question from “Did you lie . . . ?” in the pretest, to“Have you lied. . . ?” on the first run, and then back to “Did you lie .. . ?”on the second run. I don’t put a great deal of weight on the idea that arelatively small technical error of this sort completely invalidates a test,although in theory one could. Overall, the test is completely invalid solely onthe basis of the obsolete method used, or based on any one of a number of majorerrors. I go farther in cataloging lesser errors to demonstrate that the testwas generally riddled with one deficiency after another. One can thereforesurmise there are very likely other errors I can’t perceive, that would beobvious to a polygraph expert.Long after I slammed the door on all the controversy which followed theincident, the battle continued, among ufologists, in my absence. I found outlater that in 1981 Allen Hendry, on behalf of Dr. J. Allen Hynek’s Center forUFO Studies, asked the internationally recognized polygraph expert Dr. David C.Raskin for his opinion of the McCarthy test, based on its transcript. Dr. Raskinprovided him with the written opinion that the techniques used in theexamination were seriously deficient, “unacceptable,” and “more than thirtyyears out-of-date.”Cleve Backster, of the Backster Research Foundation in San Diego (whosecongressional testimony was quoted earlier), was sent a tape and transcript ofthe McCarthy test. On February 22, 1993, he wrote a letter which said, “. . . Ihave carefully reviewed the material received. Based on the outdated techniqueutilized by Mr. McCarthy, even at that time, along with a significant number ofother observations—it is my opinion that the result reported by John McCarthyfollowing that November 15, 1975, polygraph examination should not be consideredvalid.”Mr. Backster and Dr. Raskin, although they differ strongly on various technicalpoints of polygraph theory, and have perhaps a less than congenial professionalrelationship, are recognized as the top two experts in the entire world on thepolygraph. And they are in total agreement about the nonvalidity of McCarthy’stest. The test was not reviewed on the basis of the charts themselves. As I saidat the outset of this passage, the test was so flawed that chart tracingsweren’t even necessary to disqualify it.In going over the transcript I made a most stunning observation. It hit me sohard I stared at it, to make certain I was reading what I thought I was reading.Why hadn’t anyone seen it before? Passing rigorous new polygraph tests andhaving the McCarthy test invalidated by the top experts in the world were asmuch in the way of vindication as I’d thought I could get. But what I’d neverexpected was to have the McCarthy polygraph overturned by McCarthy himself!McCarthy didn’t spend any time analyzing or poring over the charts. Immediatelyafter I answered the last question, he spent a little over two minutes rollingthe charts up, putting them away, and removing the machine’s sensors from mybody. Then he said: “Travis, your responses are deceptive.” I was stunned. Itold him there had to be a mistake, that I was telling the truth. Then I saidvery emphatically, “This is what happened to me, as I see it, to the best of myknowledge.”That’s when he slipped. John J. McCarthy said: “Could it be that you have just,uh, made yourself believe that this happened to you?”A bombshell! Absolutely astounding! All a polygraph can possibly reference iswhat one believes. He had barely finished saying I was not truthful. If McCarthywas sincere and confident in his verdict, how could he, even for a second,entertain the idea that I “believed” my story true? This, ladies and gentlemenof the jury, is the true “smoking gun” concerning the polygraph examinationadministered by John J. McCarthy to Travis Walton on November 15, 1975.With the charts destroyed, all the analyses of conduct, invalidation by topexperts, my cataloging of one procedural blunder after another, totaldiscrediting of the method itself—although each is devastating by itself, noneis as abruptly enlightening in its effect as that one spontaneous remark byMcCarthy himself: “Could it be that you have just, uh, made yourself believethat this happened to you?”There’s simply no way to rationalize the implication of his question away. Hecertainly wasn’t trying to be nice to me; he was unceasingly hostile throughoutour encounter. Evidently something in those charts, which we’ll never see, toldMcCarthy something he could not reconcile with whatever conviction he had whenhe’d entered that testing room. I have a feeling it was different from theconviction he left with.McCarthy had promised complete confidentiality before he was ever hired. Hereaffirmed that promise on tape during the pretest. Also, he signed an explicitagreement to that effect. However, his word of honor notwithstanding, he brokehis promise. He made public more than his baseless conclusion. McCarthy evenfelt it necessary to reveal details of the pretest interview, an interview inwhich he pressed for and received personal information about my past that was inno way related to the UFO experience he was hired to test me for. He misusedprivileged information of mistakes I had made as a juvenile to malign me to thepublic, in a clear abuse of professional confidence.McCarthy claimed in the Arizona Republic of July 12, 1976, that he “decided tobreak silence because the National Enquirer is involved in complicity which isdetrimental to our profession.” If this was true, why had McCarthy pledged hissilence in the first place? Or why didn’t he break his word soon after thetesting date? It shouldn’t have taken him nine months to leap to the defense ofhis profession. Why hadn’t he spoken out thirty days after the test, when theEnquirer came out with their December 1975 issue on the UFO event with nomention of the test? Why not when the results of my second test were publicizedin February 1976? McCarthy’s “decision” to go public actually came about onMarch 15, 1976, during a telephone conversation with PJK. If anything, thatbreach and his ensuing mudslinging in the media were detrimental to the public’sperception of the polygraph profession. This man’s signature on a document wasmeaningless.McCarthy was bound to confidentiality by his American Polygraph Associationmembership, even if his verbal and written agreements had never been made. ItemNumber 15 of the APA Standards and Principles of Practice specifically states:“To protect the privacy of each examinee, no member shall release informationobtained during a polygraph examination to any unauthorized person. This shallnot preclude the release of polygraph charts for the purpose of quality-controlreview.”“McCarthy had badgered me during the pretest interview about my disorientationin regard to time and dates. (“Where have you been, in a vacuum?”) Yet, for mytest’s sponsors he signed an agreement which gave the incorrect date! Thedocument contains his written confidentiality agreement (“I have conducted thetest in absolute secrecy and will not divulge the results to anyone but Mr.Jenkins and Mr. Cathcart at any time.”) His promise was repeated orally on thetape of the pretest discussion. Nevertheless, PJK has tried to claim that thisacknowledged typographical error (wrong month) made it legally non-binding.”Such preference for cynical manipulation of “the letter” rather thanstraightforward adherence to “the meaning and spirit” of the law testifies as tothe code PJK operates by. To claim that such a technicality (even if the dubiouslegalistic point were valid) could relieve one of the obligation to perform aspromised seems to me to be outrageously unethical.True to form, PJK has taken every opportunity to disseminate as widely aspossible the privileged information he obtained from McCarthy. My pretestdisclosures to McCarthy have no bearing on the UFO incident at all. Distortingand publicizing them comprise the worst-spirited and least relevant of all PJK’sblatantly ad hominem attacks.I do not think I myself am guilty of same in expressing my disgust and contempt,in pointing out PJK’s total lack of intellectual integrity. The ad hominemfallacy does not arise from a negative appraisal of a person; it arises frominvalid reasoning, which attempts either to state or imply that because of thisnegative appraisal, therefore what you are saying is invalid.I explicitly state once more that the despicable nature of PJK’s tactics is notwhat invalidates his conclusions. His conclusions are not valid due to his useof tailored data, false premises, and faulty reasoning.One of the experts hired by the National Enquirer, Dr. Jean Rosenbaum, hadtestified in court as an expert on the validity of polygraph examinations. Hehad witnessed the regressive hypnosis performed on me by Dr. Harder, hadreviewed the results of a number of other tests, and was perfectly aware ofMcCarthy’s pseudograph. In a television interview with ABC-TV News 3 in Phoenixon the afternoon of November 18, 1975 (three days after McCarthy’s test, ofwhich Rosenbaum was fully informed), Rosenbaum stated: “Our conclusion, which isabsolute, is that this young man is not lying, that there is no collusioninvolved, no attempt to hoax or collusion of the family or anyone else.” Indismissing the validity of McCarthy’s test, Rosenbaum certainly could not beconsidered prejudiced in my favor, since he doesn’t believe that UFOs exist, butit’s a nice touch that he used McCarthy’s term, “collusion.”Rosenbaum had arrived shortly after the test was concluded. To ensure that hisopinion would be uninfluenced by McCarthy’s, APRO asked Rosenbaum’s opinionabout the suitability of my condition for a polygraph test before informing himit had already been performed. He strongly recommended against my taking anytest while in such a condition. PJK tried to imply that APRO’s delay in tellingRosenbaum of the test had been somehow deceptive when in fact it had been thebest way to get an unbiased opinion, in the tradition of the best science in“blind” reports.APRO has been highly criticized, especially by PJK (who has withheld allpositive data pertaining to APRO’s investigation), for not immediatelypublicizing McCarthy’s conclusion. I think such criticism is highly unfair.Responsibility for the decision not to publicize the test lies with the NationalEnquirer, that publication paid for the test, and the results were itsproperty—not McCarthy’s, not APRO’s, and not mine. Their decision was justifiedby the testimony of their expert consultants who expressed the opinion that notest given at that time could be valid, due to my emotional condition. Since theEnquirer knew the test was invalid, it chose (in this instance) to prevent thedissemination of misleading information. Their ostensible perspective (unlikethe ostensible perspectives of PJK, as well as APRO) is one of journalism ratherthan science.PJK asked hypothetically: If Walton had passed, would they have kept itconfidential? The answer is a candid no, because as previously stated, manyvariables can elicit stressful readings from an honest subject; but only honestywill result in a passed test. I might ask hypothetically: If I’d passed, wouldPJK be touting McCarthy as the most experienced examiner in the state? I thinkinstead he would have characterized him as just the oldest guy doing liedetection in Arizona, hired by some sensationalist tabloid. I think PJK wouldhave preempted the comments by APRO’s Jim Lorenzen, that the test was “badlybotched,” “unbelievably incompetent,” and that “sometimes long years ofexperience can serve to crystallize bad habits.” McCarthy retired in 1990,having used the same outdated military method—the relevant/irrelevantquestions—throughout his entire career!A recent telephone interview with McCarthy confirmed that even after all theseyears he never switched to modern methodology. McCarthy apparently doesn’t evenunderstand the polygraph terms “COT” and “relevant/irrelevant” as defined by therest of the polygraph profession. Every other examiner who has seen the McCarthytest or its transcript knows it was a relevant/irrelevant test. In its earliestform there wasn’t even a stim test. This explains why, on the tape of the test,he erroneously referred to his tricky little stim test as a “control test”! Heis apparently so ignorant of the methodology that he has confused that tinylittle improvement in the archaic relevant/irrelevant test—the “stim”—with themajor advancement of modern Control Question Test methodology. He actuallyrefers to his ancient relevant/irrelevant method as Control Question Testmethodology!Since APRO and the Enquirer had solid professional opinions dismissing thevalidity of the test, they would have been in the wrong to prematurely put forthinvalid data, which would not have added to understanding of what happened, butinstead would only have fueled the momentum of the tide of prejudice against it.However, it definitely was a public-relations dilemma. Frankly, it became a PRdebacle because of how the information finally did come out. But it also wouldhave been a PR debacle if they’d publicized it immediately.I have gone on record as characterizing good science as necessitating theultimate disclosure of all relevant data. I can think of a number of completeexceptions to this which are less extreme than the publication of data on makingimproved nuclear warheads. However, I stand by that principle for mosteverything, even though there are times when it’s best to delay that objective,at least temporarily. For example, Pons and Fleischmann were criticized for notwithholding the preliminary data of their cold-fusion experiments until they hadfurther confirmed it with better testing.I’ll concede in hindsight that probably the best thing APRO could have donewould have been to hold back on reporting the McCarthy test only until (withtheir sponsor’s permission) they could conscientiously report it as a minorfootnote to the properly conducted test I did pass later. As long as theyavoided publicizing preliminary conclusions as anything more than tentative,such an approach would have satisfied all the various ethical considerationsinvolved. APRO would have kept their members fully informed while satisfying thedesire to avoid “muddying the waters.” A problem with scientific ethics arises,not from withholding data until an investigation is properly completed, but frompublishing a conclusion while withholding data—as PJK does.After the results of McCarthy’s abortive test, it was decided that I would beallowed to calm down for a period before attempting a serious test.Due to his close involvement and his protection of me from the media, my brotherDuane had been accused by PJK of conspiring with me to perpetrate an allegedhoax. A week after my birthday, on February 7, 1976, APRO arranged a polygraphexamination for him with the Ezell Polygraph Institute of Phoenix, whichperformed all the polygraph work for the Pinal County Sheriff’s Office.I felt sufficiently recovered from the emotional trauma of my experience, anddrove the 180 miles to Phoenix from Snowflake to make use of the opportunity tobe tested. I was interviewed by APRO representatives Jim Lorenzen, Hal Star, Dr.R. Leo Sprinkle, and Dr. Harold Cahn. They judged my condition as sufficientlystable and agreed that I was ready. The examiner was informed of my availabilitybefore Duane’s testing ended.Testing was performed on Duane and me by George Pfiefer, a charter member of theArizona Polygraph Association and a full member of the American PolygraphAssociation. He had been a detective-sergeant with the police department ofMiami, Florida.Pfiefer’s report:Mr. Travis Walton was given a polygraph examination at this office at 3:00 P.M.,February 7, 1976. The purpose of this examination was to determine the truth inhis statements regarding a UFO incident that occurred on November 5, 1975, andlasting until the early morning hours of November 11, 1975, as reported byTravis. This examination was performed by using a Lafayette Polygraph Model#76056-B. During the pretest interview it was determined that Travis Walton waswell rested and cooperative, was feeling physically fit and preliminary testsindicated he was a suitable subject for the examination.A discussion was held and we mutually designed questions for this examination.Prior to the examination all questions were again reviewed with him. He agreedto answer all and signed the consent waiver form. Question formulation was ofthe relevant/irrelevant type. Following is a list of the relevant questions usedin this examination:#3. Are there approximately only two hours you recall during your experience?Answer: YES.#4. Did you find yourself on a table inside a strange room?Answer: YES.#6. Did you see strange-looking beings inside the room?Answer: YES.#7. Have you been reasonably accurate in describing your experience?Answer: YES.#9. Did you conspire with another to perpetrate a hoax about this matter?Answer: NO.#10. Were you struck by a blue-green ray on the evening of November 5, 1975?Answer: YES.#11. Since November 1, 1975, have you used any illegal narcotic drugs?Answer: NO.#13. Before November5, 1975, were you a UFO buff?Answer: NO.#14. Have you been completely truthful with Mr. Lorenzen in this matter?Answer: YES.#15. Did you see a UFO on the evening of November 5, 1975?Answer: YES.It should be noted that questions numbered 9, 10, 11, 13, and 15 were used inthis examination exactly as Mr. Travis Walton dictated them to this examiner.[Questions numbered 1, 2, 5, 8, and 12, are omitted here because they are theirrelevant questions: those which ask my name, residence, etc.] Mr. Walton wascompletely cooperative during this examination.There was some slight response regarding #10. After the first chart was run itwas determined that Travis had not actually seen a “blue-green ray” coming fromthe alleged UFO. He did see the area illuminated with a “greenish light.”After a very careful analysis of the polygrams produced, there are no areas leftunresolved and it is the opinion of this examiner that Travis Walton hasanswered all questions in a manner that he himself is firmly convinced to betruthful regarding the incident commencing November 5, 1975.George J. Pfiefer, Jr.ExaminerI believe in being objective and evenhanded with criticism; so, for starters Iwill acknowledge a couple of minor errors George Pfiefer made in writing up hisreport. In the first part of his report he wrote: “A discussion was held and wemutually designed questions for this examination.” That was correct; but he wasin error when, later in the report, he wrote that “questions numbered 9, 10, 11,13, and 15 were used in this examination exactly as Mr. Travis Walton dictatedthem.” This was incorrect, as Pfiefer now verifies.I did not “come in with the questions” I wanted to be asked, as PJK alleges. Ofthe five test questions supplied by APRO, wording was worked out by JimLorenzen, Hal Star, Dr. Cahn, and Dr. Sprinkle, whose specialty is testing: heis the Director of Counseling and Testing at the University of Wyoming. The fourAPRO people had worked out questions numbered 3, 4, 6, 7, and 14 before Iarrived; I did discuss and accept them with the examiner. However, I did notfeel they were direct enough. I offered half a dozen areas I felt should becovered, but did not specify wording of questions. (In using the word “dictate,”I believe Pfiefer was trying to emphasize my cooperativeness, in my havingsuggested the more specific questions.) Notice that the second five we ended upwith are the more direct questions. The questions I suggested did not replacethe questions APRO had planned as the complete test; they simply added to them.I was in error myself in suggesting one question, number 10, which required me,the literalist, to answer on the basis of assumption rather than experience. SoPfiefer wrote, correctly, that I “had not actually seen” the ray; but added thatI’d seen the area light up with a “greenish glow.” That addition was incorrect.I said I had seen the greenery in the area lit by the glow from the craft, butthat the light had been of a peculiar pale golden color. This occurred before Iwas hit. I felt only a numbing shock and blacked out at the same instant that mycoworkers later told me they had seen the ray strike. This may have caused alast-minute twinge of doubt. Or perhaps the sharp pain associated with thememory of this psychologically intense peak in my experience could havetriggered this “slight response.”Pfiefer confirms that he reworded every single question suggested to him for allthe tests. PJK nevertheless has repeatedly claimed that my input into thequestion formulation was a violation of proper polygraph procedure of such amagnitude that my positive test results from the Pfiefer test should beconsidered invalid.Not only is the above-mentioned practice not condemned by experts, it’srecommended! One more brief quotation from Elie A. Shneour’s article in CSICOP’sSkeptical Inquirer, “Lying About Polygraph Tests” (an article, by the way, whichrefers to Dr. David Raskin as one of the “leaders in the field”):“. . . theexamination begins with the subject being cuffed and strapped to the device. Theconsiderable resulting discomfort is eased every fifteen minutes or so while theexaminer changes charts.“These interludes provide the examiner with opportunities to ask the subjectabout his reaction to the questions posed and allow refinement of the questionsto be asked next.”More accurate concerning actual polygraph procedure, and much more to the pointon the issue, is the following excerpt from Cleve Backster’s 1974 congressionaltestimony.Congressman: Mr. Backster, on page 3 of your testimony you say here at thebottom: ‘It should be noted that all the questions are reviewed word-for-word,in advance of the beginning of the chart concerned. ’Is that reviewed with thesubject?Mr. Backster: Yes, with the subject. In fact, the subject is allowed anopportunity to help formulate the questions so that he certainly will have abasic understanding of each one to be asked...If we don’t review questions and particularly the control questions, ahead oftime, we don t know what psychological “button ” we may be touching as far asthe subject is concerned, if he hasn’t had an opportunity to talk with us aboutsuch questions.I think it is extremely imperative that questions are reviewed ahead of time.If the subject taking the test is apprehensive that surprise questions may beinterjected, he may be apprehensive to all questions. He may be attuned to somekind of outside issue that very much bothers him as compared to the relevantissue.In fairness to the subject and in fairness to the technique, Mr. Chairman, in myopinion, it is absolutely essential that the questions be carefully reviewed inadvance.George Pfiefer was interviewed by Mike on December 29, 1992, concerning hisexaminations on myself, my brother, and my mother. Here’s what he had to say:Q; Are you firm on your conclusions on the Walton test?A: Certainly!Q: You are?A: Sure!Q: What I was wondering personally is if your opinion had changed since, so Iguess it hasn't, then?A: Nope, no way, no way!Q: So I would assume then that your tests on Travis’s mother and his brother,your conclusions on all of their tests are as firm as they were originally?A: Absolutely!Q: It has been said that Travis dictated the questions to you that he wanted.A: No. You see, this is another one of those things. Now, you had a polygraphexamination, right?Q: Right.A: Now, the examiner had made out questions. Before the test started, he readyou those questions, didn’t he?Q: Right.A: And, if you didn’t like something about a question you could ask him tochange it, correct?Q: That’s correct, that’s the way ours went.A: That’s exactly what we’re talking about, just exactly.Q: So, that’s the way Walton’s went?A: Yes.The only examination solidly scheduled in advance for February 7, 1976, was mybrother Duane’s. I had been discussing my readiness to be retested with APRO,and had given them a tentative agreement to be tested along with Duane. I washaving problems with my car. If, through no fault of my own, I didn’t manage tomake my appointment, how would another missed appointment look in the wake ofthe abortive arrangements for the sheriff's test? So, since APRO wasn’t certainI’d make it, they only made an appointment for Duane.Naturally PJK reads sinister intrigue into that fact, alleging a plan to “testthe waters with Duane” before agreeing to have me tested, alleging a conspiracywhich excluded the examiner but included all the APRO personnel present. This isabsurd—how could one person’s reactions to a test have any bearing on theoutcome of a different person’s test with completely different questions?The fact is I arrived while Duane’s testing was still under way (interrupting atest in progress isn’t allowed), and committed myself to being tested to theAPRO personnel there, without receiving the slightest hint of how my brother’stesting was going, since nobody had any idea at that point. (I never saw Duanethat day at all. That evening I did talk to him about the tests, by telephone,on my way out of town.) While Duane was being tested I went across the streetfor a walk in the park with Dana. While we were gone the examiner was askedabout testing me during a break between test series (Duane actually took twoseparate tests in a row, one with six relevant questions and one with eightrelevant questions), prior to the examiner giving his conclusion on Duane’stests. Duane finished and left to return to his work before I returned from thepark.The irrelevant questions, which ask for name, residence, etc., are not listedand are only asked in order to provide a yardstick of “known truth” responsesfor comparison. Also, Duane initially took the “Known Lie Test,” which showedhim a strong responder. Some of the fourteen relevant questions (the others werevariations or subissues of these) on my brother’s polygraph test were:#2. Did you participate in a hoax to pretend that Travis was missing?#3. Do you believe that Travis participated in a hoax to pretend that he wasmissing?#4. Do you know where Travis was located during the several days that he wasmissing?#5. Do you believe that Travis is sincere in describing his experience while hewas missing?#6. Would you lie to help Travis in this matter?#7. Did Travis hide on the Kellett Ranch?#8. Prior to November S, 1975, had you read a book on UFOs?The examiner, George Pfiefer, wrote in his report: “After a careful analysis ofthe polygrams produced, along with information gained during pretest andpost-test interviews, it is the opinion of this examiner that Duane Walton hasanswered all questions truthfully according to what he believes to be the truthregarding this incident and has not attempted to be deceptive in any area.”When Duane was protecting me from being grilled by the press, the sheriff's men,and the curious, he said things to throw people off the scent. Then, when PJKcalled and tried to pry into mistakes I’d made when I was younger, and asked ifI had taken a test prior to Pfiefer’s, Duane denied any such knowledge. PJKcontrasts that fact with Duane’s being judged truthful on question number 6above, and tries to claim a disparity which overturns the validity of the entiretest.Duane had learned prior to the call of PJK’s reputation for being rabidlyanti-UFO, unfair, devious, prone to twisting people’s words to suit hispurposes. In fact, Duane ignored advice not even to speak to him. But PJKarrogantly presumes that people should respond to him as if he were a federalspecial prosecutor, with as much openness, fullness, and precision as iftestifying under oath before a full session of both houses of Congress. However,surveys show that when confronted with a person one considers shady, or believesintends one harm, most honest people consider themselves justified in speakingat odds with the facts to whatever extent is necessary.Naturally Duane interpreted question number 6 to mean, would he lie to help mefalsify a UFO incident?—that was the reason he was taking the test. The sponsorsof the test knew of Duane’s shielding me from being mobbed, because theythemselves at first had been deflected by him in their efforts to investigatethe case. They wouldn’t have framed a question to encompass falsehoodsoriginating in brotherly protectiveness. Psychologists observe that there are noperfectly truthful persons; modern polygraph methodology actually counts on thisfact, even to establish innocence.PJK has gotten so carried away in attacking the Turkey Springs incident that hehas even made allegations against my mother! I brought her along when I was inPhoenix to meet with Dr. J. Allen Hynek on March 22, 1976. As mentioned, thelate Dr. Hynek was an astronomer at Northwestern University, and, as head of theCenter for UFO Studies, was a leading national authority on unidentified flyingobjects. Hynek was probably best known to the general public for his ProjectBlue Book work for the U.S. Air Force and acting as scientific consultant in themaking of the movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The renowned scientistmade a press release the next day endorsing the validity of my experience,saying I was “not hoaxing” and “had been made the subject of a lot ofunnecessary and unfounded accusations.”APRO arranged for my mother to take a polygraph test while we were there. Hertesting was uneventful, performed more as a matter of course than from seriousquestioning of her integrity. Some of the thirteen relevant questions on hertest were:#3. Did you ever conspire with Travis or any person to perpetrate a hoax topretend that Travis was missing?#4. Were you deeply involved in the UFO subject before Travis’ disappearance?#6. During the period of November 6, 1975, to November 10, 1975, did youactually know where Travis was?#7. Did you conceal Travis from public contact between November 5, 1975, andNovember 11, 1975?#9. Do you believe that Travis is truthful in this matter?#10. Have you yourself ever seen a flying saucer?The examiner’s judgment of her truthfulness was written in his report asfollows: “After a very careful analysis of the polygraphs produced and comparingthe polygraph tracings with the Known Lie pattern, it is the opinion of thisexaminer that Mrs. Mary Kellett has answered all the questions truthfullyaccording to the best of her knowledge and beliefs.”Observant readers will have noticed in the report on my test that it says“Question formulation was of the relevant/irrelevant type.” That was also themethod used on my brother and mother’s test. In the interest of being consistentwith the criteria I’ve been using concerning polygraph tests, wouldn’t thevalidity of these tests have to be disqualified on the same basis that expertsdisqualified McCarthy’s test? (Readers won’t find such candor or balance inPJK’s writings.)The experts disqualified the McCarthy test on the basis of two aspects. Oneaspect was the multitude of what would have been judged to be procedural errorseven by those who accepted its methodology. The other disqualifying aspect wasits discredited methodology, which implicitly included the fact that it was a“failed” test! Whoa, you say. That sounds like the reverse of PJK’s biasedcriteria of accepting all flunked tests as proof and claiming all passed testsare flawed.I know it’s ironic, but with the relevant/irrelevant methodology it really isthe case that failed tests are the only area in which the research showed suchgross unreliability! (As we can conclude from information given in PJK’ s fellowCSICOP member’s article, in a situation using modern methods where you have onetest pass and one fail, the pass has considerably greater weight. But theresearch shows that with relevant/irrelevant it is overwhelmingly so.)In the same research study (Horowitz, 1988) which demonstrated the method yields80 percent false positives (that is, only 20 percent of the independentlyestablished innocent subjects were correctly classified), quantitative chartevaluations yielded 100-percent correct outcomes on guilty subjects! Again, thisrefers to independently proven and confirmed guilt. (Of course, this percentagewould drop below 100 percent in actual field use to where it would actually be abit less than the upper ninetieth percentile of accuracy shown for polygraph ingeneral. Averaging the innocent and guilty together naturally gives the methodan accuracy rate far lower than that of polygraph in general.) But if the methodis so skewed it calls 80 percent of innocent subjects liars, it’s no surprise itgets the last few percent of the guilty ones—it’s probably by accident! Soundslike that old mercenary soldier’s saying, “Kill ’em all, let God sort ’em out.”Evidently your reactions have to be extremely innocent to pass arelevant/irrelevant test, but when you do pass, it’s pretty solid.Also Pfiefer was not using an old machine like McCarthy’s, he was using a moremodern four-trace machine. (PJK never mentions this but knew about it, since heput pictures of both machines in his book.) And Pfiefer didn’t make the numerousviolations of accepted procedure that McCarthy committed.When PJK sought to discredit the Pfiefer test, he called Pfiefer’s employer. TomEzell. APRO, in the interest of full disclosure, had informed George Pfiefer ofthe McCarthy test, so there was no suppression of that information wheredisclosure was relevant and proper. That information was given to Ezell andAssociates in confidence; but according to PJK Tom Ezell volunteered it to him,in violation of professional confidence and flouting item number 15 of APAStandards and Principles of Practice.If true, Tom Ezell shares responsibility with McCarthy in the release ofprivileged information; a wrong McCarthy severely compounded by confirming thetest results, and in going on to repeat personal information about me acquiredin the confidential pretest interview. I have been told I have a solid legalcase against all involved here, including the clerk who illegally supplied PJKwith details, but right now I’d be satisfied if they would cease and desisttheir malicious campaign.In that first, March 13, 1976, call, Ezell told PJK that Pfiefer had returned toindependent practice. Apparently Ezell was quickly cornered into trying todistance himself from the tests he himself had arranged with APRO by saying he’dbeen out of town. The tests took place on February 9, 1976, and PJK’s call cameon March 13, 1976, more than a month later. Why hadn’t Ezell been movedimmediately to “reassess” Pfiefer’s work? He claimed to already have had doubtsfrom talking to Pfiefer after hearing the verdicts on returning to town. Why isit that only after being contacted by PJK more than thirty days later did Ezellmention his “doubts” and “offer” to make a reappraisal within ten days? Whatreally happened during that first phone call? What really motivated Ezell tovolunteer the information he did—including some words of praise for McCarthy?Perhaps it’s no wonder Ezell gave such praise of McCarthy, since they had beenboth still using the same outdated method. But is Ezell now still usingrelevant/irrelevant? His answer: “No! No no. No no! We use Control QuestionTechnique now!” Why did he abandon the old method tests? “Because I found outthose were making too many mistakes.” Recall that McCarthy used therelevant/irrelevant method for his entire career.Tom Ezell, who had originally been scheduled to administer Duane’s and my tests,had to be out of town that day, but informed APRO that Pfiefer was “as qualifiedas I am. He’s up on all the latest methods.”Ezell evidently remained of that opinion until he was goaded by PJK intodisavowing my test. (Shortly after which he, like McCarthy, destroyed thecorresponding charts!) In the March 22, 1976, phone call, Ezell did not say thatthe test was failed; in fact, in PJK’s own version, Ezell avoided using the word“inconclusive.” Either he didn’t want to commit so firmly to contradicting aconclusion he’d already received payment for; or he may have used the word, withPJK omitting it as too neutral for his purposes. Its absence could be evidencethat Ezell was only looking for a face-saving neutral position to back into.Maybe PJK edited Ezell’s actual words so thoroughly that Ezell’s meaning hasbeen greatly altered. A complete and accurate transcript of IJK’s calls to Ezelland an unexpurgated copy of his letter would likely throw enough light to give awhole new interpretation of their exchange.The March 22, 1976, phone call PJK quotes has undergone the usual curiousmetamorphosis. In his June 20, 1976, white paper PJK quoted Ezell: “You wouldnot be able to say if [Travis Walton] is telling the truth or if he’s lying.”Even though PJK attacks Duane and his test extensively in that sameseventeen-page report, not a single word was mentioned about Ezell’s“reassessing” Duane’s test. However, by the time the conversation appeared inPJK’s book, “reassessment” was embellished to include Duane’s test.When APRO heard about that unofficial new conclusion, APRO wrote to Ezellinquiring as to whether he would be interested in making the revision officialby returning the money his firm had received as payment for two valid polygraphtests. Ezell didn’t reply. But if he was confident in second-guessing Pfiefer,why did he destroy the charts?People have suggested Ezell was cooperating with a government cover-up, but Idon’t think so. When another skeptical UFO investigator recently brought upEzell’s disavowal, I told him I believed it was all a PR job because Ezellfigured the flak in the news media would hurt his business. I’ve heard thatpeople around Tom Ezell observed that for days (“days” perhaps being those afterPJK’s first call, rather than after hearing Pfiefer’s verdict) he became deeplyupset and depressed about the effect the UFO stigma from the media controversywould have on his business.I bet the ufologist that if Ezell were asked again to test someone claiming aUFO experience that he would refuse the business just on the basis of thesubject matter. If his problem was only disbelief in UFOs, he could test themand prove it. He couldn’t imagine there was stigma attached to flunking suchsubjects, only in substantiating their reports. So we asked him. Sure enough, hesaid, “I’d rather not get mixed up in that, I’d rather not.” Due to the subjectmatter? “Yeah.”PJK carefully stacked his description of Pfiefer’s and McCarthy’s credentials ina very biased fashion I will specify later. PJK’s main point was that Pfieferwas less experienced; therefore, years of experience became the ultimatestandard of the comparative skill of polygraph examiners.In the wake of the controversy after the two polygraph tests, Jerome Clark, thenassociate editor at Clark Publishing Company, sponsored a PSE (psychologicalstress evaluator) examination of a taped interview of me and also tapes(provided by APRO) of my two polygraph examinations by Pfiefer and McCarthy; thePSE charts were analyzed by two independent PSE experts.PSE was an electronic “lie-detection” technique in use at that time which hadbeen developed in the previous ten years by three retired Army Intelligenceofficers: Allan Bell, Jr., Wilson Ford, and Charles McQuiston. The PSE is aninstrument which was said to detect inaudible frequency changes in the humanvoice caused by emotional stress.Inevitably the PSE, like all “lie-detecting” techniques, has generatedcontroversy, partly because stress does not automatically equal lying, andbecause of competition between businesses employing differing types of “liedetection”—principally, the PSE and the polygraph.Enough security experts, law enforcement officers, industrial investigators, andother such professionals approved PSE at that time (proponents claimed it wasmore than 90-percent accurate) that the method grew widely in use; a dozenstates admitted it as evidence in court. But the technique has languished fromlack of further development, and has never gained the status or level of use ofthe polygraph. In fact, even though these tests corroborated my story, in theinterest of objectivity I must admit—based on what I’ve learned about its levelof development at that time—that I don't believe the PSE should be given muchweight. I only include it because I heard that William Spaulding of GSW claimedto have taken a PSE which supported his position. However, for whatever it’sworth, my PSE results follow.One expert, Ann B. Hooten of Mid-America Laboratory in Minneapolis, concludedher January 30, 1978, final report of my PSEs thusly: “The opinion of thisoffice and staff is that Travis Walton is sincere in believing his UFOexperience was genuine.”Several weeks later the other expert, one of the PSE’s developers himself,Charles McQuiston, concluded his thirty chart evaluation with, “His stressfactors indicate to me there is little if any possibility of a hoax involvementin telling the story. His patterns are varied. He’s under varying degrees ofstress ranging from extreme stress almost to the panic point in describingcertain traumatic elements of his experience. I don’t think this would bepossible if it was any kind of a hoax being perpetrated on his part. Thepatterns are consistent with [those of] other subjects of UFO sightings that Ihave run in terms of where they display the stress. . . .”“For this reason I believe it’s pretty consistent with a subject who had atraumatic experience and is recalling this experience which is causing histrauma [in the sense that he is] reliving the trauma he was under. He reallybelieves that he lived this, that he saw the creatures in question.” Afterreviewing and running PSE analysis on the PSE evaluations by Ann Hooten,McQuiston stated, “Both that test—the PSE taken during the [McCarthy] polygraphexamination—and the subsequent PSE test taken by Ann Hooten are NDI: nodeception indicated. He did not fail those tests.”PJK has made arrogant and unjustified accusations of lying against nearlyeveryone he attacks, which has included respected scientists, police officers,priests, and professionals of every sort. We’re in the midst of many examples ofPJK’s statements that are at odds with the truth; these are but a fraction ofhis falsehoods in this matter if we include the vast multitude of lies ofomission, which I’ll be getting to.In looking back over PJK’s writings on UFOs, a gradual change in his approachbecomes evident. His first book takes witnesses at their word and tries toexplain what people report as honest mistakes of sightings of what he consideredto be a real phenomena (plasmas).His second book touches on the hoax explanation, but mostly in regards to youngkids and college students as pranksters. But in this second book he stillspecifically says that reports do not come only from “kooks” and that many “comefrom seemingly honest, intelligent and often well-educated citizens.” And hissecond book also lists his Ten Ufological Principles of which only one refers tohoax while the other nine refer to visual or mental misperceptions by “basicallyhonest and intelligent persons” or honest (if inept) oversight by newspersonsand investigators.Then in his third book on this topic, he largely forgets ufological principles,includes a few cases of honest misperception, but for the most part sees hoaxesand liars everywhere.His fourth anti-UFO book takes the final step: Ufological principles arecompletely omitted and proponents are all either liars or mentally deludedpeople and their cynical exploiters who are now downright dangerous and a threatto society.Even the titles of his books follow the evolving pattern of his increasingobsession: UFOs Identified, UFOs Explained, UFOs—The Public Deceived, and then,UFO Abductions—A Dangerous Game.This evolution of PJK’s growing obsession with lying and lie detectors (whilehis own distortions of the truth accumulate monumentally) has paralleled hisincreasing hostile irrationality and behavior resembling that of a crank. To hiswritings he adds quotes about lying taken from famous persons of the past. “Onefalsehood treads on the heels of another” (Terence). “He who permits himself totell a lie once, finds it much easier to do it a second time and a third time,till at length it becomes habitual” (Thomas Jefferson). “Half the truth is oftena great lie” (Benjamin Franklin). “He who does not bellow the truth when heknows the truth makes himself the accomplice of liars and forgers” (CharlesPeguy). These last two are especially good advice—too bad he doesn’t follow it,instead of withholding every bit of favorable evidence.PJK made so much noise about the validity of the tests on the six witnesses, andthe validity of the tests on me, my brother, and my mother, that the nine of usthrew down the gauntlet. We threw his “Talk is cheap, put your money where yourmouth is” challenge back at him. The nine of us challenged him to have us allretested according to standards he would first agree would yield valid results.He would not have to pay a cent if any tests were failed, we would. However, hewould have to pay for all tests passed. If he was sincere, how could he refuse?One might think a proposition so straightforward would come to quick resolution.Not with PJK. Our correspondence was undertaken publicly, so he finally agreed,“in principle” only, to save face. But we were just entering the most ridiculousspectacle of evasion, equivocation, nitpicking, stalling, ducking, and dodgingfrom him one can imagine.Our first mistake was letting him get away with redefining the issue. His replynever said, “I accept your challenge”—something you simply either accept orreject. His reply termed it a “proposal”; in subsequent letters it wasdowngraded to “agreement,” then to “equitable agreement,” then “negotiations fora mutually acceptable agreement.”The decision to negotiate would not have been a mistake with a normal,fair-minded individual. With PJK it turned into a preposterously aggravating,tangled nightmare.He worded his response to include a list of those persons challenging, butsneakily dropped my mother from the list of test subjects. Then, after initiallyagreeing to a list that included Duane, a little while later he also dropped mybrother in the same sneaky way—a casual relisting of the test subjects withanother name deleted, again with no comment.When we caught the alteration and took him to task about it, he made the lameexcuse that since they weren’t present during the incident, they didn’t need tobe tested! After publishing pages and pages of accusations and insinuationsagainst them, he dug in his heels and refused to include them. So, one clear,early victory achieved by our “challenge” was, in effect, to force PJK to admitfor all to see that he really believed at least Duane and my mother wereinnocent of his charges. Since then, however, he has hypocritically continued torepeat those charges, even though he wouldn’t put his money where his mouth waswhen it counted.After including Duane and reneging, PJK made a qualified acceptance of a choiceof polygraph examiner, then reneged. The proposed examiner was none other thanthe eminent Gleve Backster. PJK backed out on Backster because Jim Lorenzen hadspoken with him first, implying, absurdly, that whoever spoke to Backster firstwould corrupt him.Backster had at one time performed research involving primary perception at thecellular level in plants and animals, which he had gotten into serendipitouslywhen using one of his polygraph machine’s sensors to measure an office plant’srate of water uptake. After PJK had rejected Backster as examiner, he dug up aninaccurate old newspaper clipping about his plant inquiries and made a futileattempt at ad hominem ridicule. Backster has done probably every investigationimaginable with a polygraph, hooking it to everybody and everything around him;it’s not surprising that in all his years of research he ventured into an areasomewhat less well received by restricted thinkers than his more conventionalresearch.PJK’s excuses for all his backtracking were ridiculous. We couldn’t seem to makereal headway. As soon as we thought we had one of his objections resolved, hewould find another.One of PJK’s delaying tactics was to demand signatures from all of us on eachpiece of correspondence. This mischief had us driving all over the state togather signatures. (We’d organized by phone.) So we had to insist on beingrepresented by the signature of our erstwhile crew chief, Mike Rogers.Before this, PJK kept taunting us about the missing signatures of Smith andDalis. He mistakenly believed we didn’t know that PJK knew Dalis was in jail. Hesecretly assumed that, as he later admitted, this meant Dalis would be unable tobe tested. That may have been the only reason PJK agreed, even “in principle,”to our challenge, thinking Allen Dalis’ inability to test would provide PJK aloophole for escape, and simultaneously serve to make it look as if we hadchallenged him in bad faith.After his stealthy elimination of my mother and brother, he took elaborate careto word each tentative, qualified reference to acceptance to clearly state “you,and the other six members of your crew.” However, we had already checked withDalis’ lawyer and at the jail to make sure that he could be tested there or athis lawyer’s office. PJK’s attempt to trick us by pretending not to know ofDalis’ troubles didn’t work, but he did resurrect the old “guilt by association”component of his adhominem tactic.Niggling refinement of terms went on for nearly a year before we’d had enough.The agreement had become seven typed, single-spaced, pages long; it wasbeginning to look like a piece of three-committee legislation. It was fair, andas refined as we cared to get. We issued a final, unequivocal, put-up-or-shut-upchallenge. Again he tried to quibble and harangue, hedge and qualify.After eleven months (with a frustrated pause or two) of exasperating and sincerenegotiations on our part, we realized we never would actually get him to end hisfilibuster and follow through. He never acted as if he comprehended thedefinition of a challenge—a sham, from one always issuing challenges himself.Has he ever negotiated the terms of his challenges? PJK had, in effect, rejectedour challenge and we published that fact. He had failed, clear and simple, toseize an opportunity to \"put his money where his mouth is” and prove he wasunafraid to stand behind his accusations.PJK denies that he declined the final challenge (which he refers to as anultimatum), but his last reply really didn’t differ in tone from his first,nearly a year earlier.If one wishes not to rely on my synopsis of the matter, beware of relying on theselective quotations PJK publishes. I can provide the opportunity to examinecomplete, unexpurgated copies for serious, respectable investigators, if any arethat interested, of the whole frustrating exchange, with commentary (it amountsto an entire book in itself), so that a fully informed judgment can be made.Nearly everyone who followed the exchange (carried out publicly, with manycopies of letter after letter going to polygraph examiners McCarthy and Pfiefer, Sheriff Gillespie, newsmen, and interested investigators) said it was plain tothem that we were sincere and PJK was not.Our final words on the subject:Mr. (PJK):Just as we expected, your decline of our final challenge was buried in pages andpages of convoluted exhortations intertangled with selective repetitions of allyour ridiculous old assertions. But just as we said in our challenge-letter, weare not the slightest bit interested in your excuses.The definition of a challenge is not \"an equitable agreement,\" as you wouldprefer. A challenge is a challenge. You have failed to accept ours—pure andsimple. Our challenge to you was to (in your own words) \"put up or shut up.\" Youhave failed to \"put up\" and unfortunately will probably not \"shut up\" either.Therefore, we turn a deaf ear to your rabid tirades. Since you don't haveanything important to say, no one listens to you anyway. Anyone who has hadanything to do with you knows that anything you say is nothing but characterassassination, negative proofs, misrepresentation of material quoted out ofcontext, innuendo, false logic, selective mention and omission of data, etc.,etc. In short, the tools of shyster lawyers and propagandists.The incident at Turkey Springs did, in fact, happen and perhaps someday you willadmit it. But your aberration is so extreme that it is doubtful that even a longride in a UFO could cure you.This is our very last correspondence with you. Do not bother writing anymore, asall mail from you will be returned unopened.Sincerely,The Nine Test Subjects(PJK sneakily circumvented our ban on his endless letters by sending Mike one inan American Airlines envelope with no return address.)Just like PJK’s force-fit of UFO data into his plasma theory, PJK’s“investigations” would be laughed out of real science. And speaking of shysterlawyer tactics, since PJK fails in his claimed arena of science, how would hepan out in the legal arena? That which would be laughed out of science wouldlikewise be thrown out of court.However flawed in the logical sense, the legal system is an institution which,like debate and science, is yet another forum for arriving at “truth.” PJK usesall the discredited tactics in this arena, too. When PJK quotes biased andunreliable witnesses, he equates the accuracy of his quote (unreliable initself) with the factuality of the statement. For someone whose father was alawyer, he should know better than to use character assassination, hearsay,withheld evidence, leading questions, innuendo, etc. He sent this collection ofpettifoggery to Sheriff Marlin Gillespie in an effort to get him to prosecutethe nine of us. The sheriff turned PJK’s material over to the county attorney,who, together with the sheriff, told reporters that although they’d certainlyprosecute anything solid, PJKs material didn’t amount to anything more than acollection of opinions, theories, and unsubstantiated supposition. Many peoplewere fooled by his writings until they saw the other side, but Sheriff Gillespieand Navajo County attorney Bob Hall were astute enough that they could clearlysee this without having heard our rebuttals.Earlier I mentioned an attempt to pay Steve Pierce to disprove the UFO incident.Several aspects of the episode made it appear that PJK was behind the offer. Theoffered amount of $ 10,000, for one, an amount PJK has offered a number of timesin various challenges, added to that suspicion.However, PJK denies any involvement, claiming that the first time he knew aboutthe offer was when he read Bill Barry’s account of it. PJK implied that only onhearing that Steve was “considering repudiating the incident” did he becomeinterested in making contact with him. This supposedly led him for the firsttime to make contact with the officer who had taken the offer to Steve.If that is true, why, in his report of talking to the deputy, didn’t PJK mentionwhat the deputy had to say concerning the $ 10,000 offer? If PJK were innocent,one would expect that in the face of such a damaging charge he would be highlymotivated to obtain exonerating quotes with which to clear himself to hisreaders.PJK wrote of Barry’s account in UFOs: The Public Deceived.Clearly Rogers feared that at least one member of his crew would fail the test,regardless of who was accepted as the examiner. Barry’s book quotes Rogers assaying: “Steve told me and Travis that he had been offered ten thousand dollarsjust to sign a denial. He said he was thinking about it. ... So I told him,‘Then you’ll spend the money alone, and you’ll be bruised.’ ” The lattersuggests that Rogers was threatening Pierce with physical harm if he recanted.Beware the ellipses, those three dots so often found in PJK’s quotes. Theyfrequently stand in for information he wishes to hide in order to falsify thespeaker’s true meaning.Here’s what that passage on page 160 of Barry’s book actually said:According to Mike Rogers, “Steve told me and Travis that he had been offered tenthousand dollars just to sign a denial. He said he was thinking about taking it.We asked him, ‘Even though you know it happened, would you deny it just for themoney?’ He said maybe he would; he was thinking about it. So I told him, ‘Thenyou’ll spend the money alone, and you’ll be bruised.’ ”PJK only used one set of ellipses to make two omissions—his chief aim to omitdeliberately the key phrase “Even though you know it happened, would you deny itjust for the money?”—an obvious effort to deceive his readers into believingthat Mike was threatening Steve to keep him from “recanting” or revealing thetruth, rather than threatening retribution for knowingly giving false testimonyfor money! What a sneaky trick! How fraudulent can he get? PJK also said thisindicated Mike was afraid Pierce wouldn’t pass the test we had challenged PJK toprovide; the full quotation proves quite the contrary.Bafflingly, PJK quotes Steve as telling him: “If I could ever prove it was ahoax I’d damn sure do it,” contradicting PJK’s hypothesis that Steve alreadyknew the incident to be a hoax. I could say the same and still not be denying myperceptions and memories. If I found out that some earth organization orgovernment was responsible for what has happened to me, I, too, would damn suretry to prove it.I have reason to believe that if PJK could be induced to turn over the entiretape of the withheld portions of his conversation with Steve, the public wouldhave something else to raise eyebrows about. PJK’s vague reference to thisundisclosed portion was: “But I could not gain any meaningful details about whathad transpired.”Knowing PJK’s tactics, “any meaningful details” could refer to a great deal ofpositive testimony. Another example of such use of words was his reference to ablood sample (which, in opposition to his charges, contained no trace of anydrug): “[D] etailed examination . . . included analysis of a blood sample, whichrevealed nothing unusual.” He was not pointing out that it was a drug-freesample. It was actually a sly way of getting around that glaring disproof of hischarge, by emphasizing that the sample displayed no bizarre characteristic orunknown substance which would constitute an indisputable artifact of alienabduction.In the February 1993 issue of the MUFON Journal I wrote of PJK: “When hiscontrived edifice first started to crumble as I began refuting him, he wasalready showing signs of wavering and edging away from his prior claims. WhenI’m done, I predict he’ll be forced to make a full retreat from the collapsingruin of his previous ‘convictions.’ And I predict that he’ll come to act as ifhe never really said any of those things. After some vain attempts to defend theold nonsense, he’ll espouse some new nonsense with the same fervent certainty.”My words apparently touched a nerve. Our “debunker” issued a $ 1,000 challengewager in his March 1993 newsletter concerning my prediction, listing six pointswhich he claims to be unassailable. Most of the six points were obscure in theirbearing on the principal facts of the case. They referred to a couple of hearsayquotes (which are false, but ultimately improvable either way, since theyweren’t taped); the McCarthy test; the out-of-context quote from Steve Pierce;and an excerpt from the Sylvanus tape of Sylvanus’ interview with Duane and Mikeat the forest site.Well, the ink was barely dry on his words before PJK was issuing a retraction onone of his unassailable points. He had claimed in one of his books that I hadsaid in a TV interview that I had been “bleeding heavily” during my experience.He then went on about the subsequent absence of wounds on my body or blood on myclothes, as if he were the only person astute enough to catch what would havebeen an astoundingly obvious contradiction. He subsequently was forced to admitthat I had indeed said “breathing heavily” not “bleeding heavily.” He said he’dpublish his retraction accordingly.(He didn’t fully keep that promise. In his newsletter, SUN, he wrote: “TheEditor of SUN wishes to clarify its editorial policy which firmly adheres to thefollowing principles: (1) SUN never errs. (2) When SUN does err, it never admitsit. (3) However, there may be times when some ‘clarification’ is appropriate.”He then gave his retraction as “Clarification #1,” and repeated his intention soto correct future editions of his book. Contrast this “never admit it” policywith his Ufological Principle Number 4. criticizing the media for not correctingpro-UFO errors.)What actually prompted PJK to publish his correction was the fact that CSICOP’sexecutive director, Barry Karr, had heard about his misquoting of me and askedPJK about it. So he was faking good for his cronies, but PJK made no such effortto correct another such “error” exposed on national television a few days later.Was this “bleeding”/“breathing” thing a deliberate trick? Or just an error,another example of the “careful investigation” and “accuracy” PJK boasts about?It’s hard to see how he could have sincerely made such a mistake, because thetape (contrary to his excuses) is quite clear; even his own published transcriptof it shows that right after the phrase in question I added: “I couldn’t catchmy breath.”Speaking of breath, I didn’t hold mine waiting for his $1,000 check, which I’veyet to receive.The account above is just a typical example of the quality of his work and theflimsiness of his case—and just the beginning of the fulfillment of mypredictions.Jeff Wells, an Australian member of the team of National Enquirer reporters whoworked on my story, later left that paper and wrote some articles about what herepresented as his experiences as part of the Enquirer’s coverage of the UFOincident. There doesn’t seem to be any low to which those lacking in ethics,journalistic and otherwise, will not stoop in printing anything that will servetheir ends.After years of heaping scornful criticism on the tabloids, PJK and CSICOPapparently felt no hypocrisy in reprinting the ex-tabloid writer’s article inthe Summer 1981 issue of the Skeptical Inquirer. (The Skeptical Inquirer wasevidently named to take a backhanded slap at the tabloids by playing off theNational Enquirer’s name, to make clear that CSICOP considered themselves theantithesis of the tabloid mentality.) The article was riddled with tabloid-stylehyperbole, distortion, and pure fiction. But PJK, as “UFO editor,” added remarkstaking issue with only two falsehoods, which he judged to err in the directionof supporting our case’s validity. It seems to me there’s no muck so rank thatPJK won’t suck it up and spew it out to the public; but, again, not without whatI’ll call “creative enhancement” in the direction of what he wishes it had said,as I shall here elucidate.There were so many outrageously baseless lies in Jeff Wells’ article (whichcould be easily refuted since the proceedings were taped and there were manyothers present) that I won’t even bother to refute them individually. (Thecoincidence is ironic, but this freelance writer Jeff Wells is apparently notthe same freelance writer Jeff Wells who has been embroiled in so manyaccusations of outrageously false reporting about Schwarzenegger’s film The LastAction Hero, Clint Eastwood, and other entertainment-industry figures.)PJK passed the Skeptical Inquirer version off as a “reprint.” However,apparently it offered an excess of sleaze-appeal which PJK felt compelled totidy up with a little undisclosed erasing. I came into possession of a copy ofthe photocopies of the original newspaper article which PJK had been circulatingamong ufologists. Since they didn’t match, his hand was tipped. Some of hischanges were irrelevant: reparagraphing, changing Australian spellings toAmerican usage. But other alterations were designed to make the piece look morerespectable, thereby misleading readers as to its reliability.The original newspaper version of the article begins: “The characters in thisUFO story are real even if they appear more like the inventions of a Hollywoodhack.” They weren’t real, they were the inventions of a tabloid hack. Hecontinues: “A haunted young man, a ruthless cowboy, a hard-drinkingpsychiatrist, a bunch of reporters and a beautiful girl with a kinky sexproblem.”PJK’s Skeptical Inquirer version read as follows: “A haunted young man, aruthless cowboy, a strange professor, a hard-drinking psychiatrist, and a bunchof reporters.” No editor’s note here, no ellipses, only a seamless, air-brushedflow of words, with no reference to the beautiful girl with a kinky sex problem.Wells may have been referring to the only female present, Dr. Rosenbaum’sattractive psychologist wife, Dr. Beryl Rosenbaum. Of course the kinky sexproblem was fiction. (And Wells had the gall in his article to refer to 60Minutes as a “muckraker TV show.”)PJK’s sanitized reprint then changed the phrase “shack up with us in a luxurymotel” to “hole up with us in a luxury motel.” The only payoff on the sexualbait at the top of the article was when Wells wrote later on in the fiction:. . . the psychiatrist put the cowboy and the kid through a long session ofanalysis.Their methods were unique. The next day the four of them disappeared into aroom, and soon a waiter headed in there with two bottles of cognac.At the end of it the psychiatrists were rolling drunk, but they had their storyand the brothers were crestfallen.PJK left that imaginary scene undoctored because no one would read sexualsuggestion into it without the earlier material he had deleted.PJK so indiscriminately seized on anything, regardless of the source, which hecould use against me, that he stooped to borrowing from tabloid writers, a grouphe and CSICOP had previously so often derided. It didn’t even bother him thatthe article stated: “Our first sight of the kid was at dinner in the moteldining room that night. It was a shock. He sat there mute, pale, twitching likea cornered animal.” True, but, incidentally, refuting PJK’s claim that I hadbeen in a proper state to take a polygraph test. Wells continued with thisembellishment:But suddenly the strain began to tell on the kid and he lapsed into sobbingbouts. He was falling apart and so was his story.It necessitated flying in a husband-and-wife team of psychiatrists from Coloradoto tranquilize the kid and keep the cowboy from exploding. The kid was a wreck,and it was all the psychiatrists could do to get him ready for the lie detectorexpert we had lined up. [Wells’ recollection of the chronology of events is inerror. The polygraph test was given by McCarthy in the early afternoon ofNovember 15, 1975, and the two Colorado psychiatrists did not arrive in Phoenixuntil that evening.—Ed.](I was not tranquilized. Also, PJK didn’t actually put his name to thearticle—except as “Ed.” However, since PJK is the UFO editor of the SkepticalInquirer, and the chairman of CSICOP’s UFO subcommittee, and since my experiencewas his territory at CSICOP, and because it was he who circulated the newspaperarticle from which the alleged “reprint” was taken, I felt it reasonable toassume that PJK is “Ed.”—but any such assumption like this should be solabeled.)Wells not only gets the basic chronology wrong, he describes events he couldn'thave seen. Yet the editors at CSICOP praised the “significant insights” of thetabloid writer’s article, respectfully referring to him as a “journalist.” (Imight also point out that, as fantastical and exaggerated as Wells’ account was,he didn’t claim that Duane had thrown McCarthy bodily out of the motel, whichWells would surely have done—with avid embellishment—if McCarthy’s charge hadbeen true.)There is another interesting sidelight to this. Jeff Wells wrote a secondversion of his same tale for Omni magazine’s March 1982 “Antimatter” column. Iwas not then aware of the earlier Skeptical Inquirer article, but took greatoffense at the multitude of gross misrepresentations in the Omni column: so manythey almost crowded out all truth. Except for some of the names and dates andplaces, and except for his description of the shape I was in, there was not onecompletely true and accurate sentence in it.At that time Carol Burnett had just won a huge judgment against the NationalEnquirer for false reports of supposedly drunken public antics. Her story,widely reported in the news media, had an underlying parallel to my situation,with Wells’ false claim of drunkenness. I made reference to her case as animplied warning concerning Omnis responsibility to truth in the matter.March 15, 1982Omni909 Third AvenueNew York, NY 10022Omni Letters/Dialogue:Jeff Wells' \"UFO Update\" in \"Antimatter,\" March '82 was the most ludicrous packof lies yet written about my November 1975 experience. There are so manydistortions and outright fabrications in that half page that I can't begin torebut them all. Wells' years at the National Enquirer have left him with somebad habits.Wells did not ever see me or my brother \"staggering\" drunk. I am a 100%abstaining, teetotaling non-drinker. My brother and I did not and do not drinkalcoholic beverages of any kind.The idea of my having a transitory psychosis involving a UFO cultist father whoabandoned me is an absurd invention. I am now told that my father had no suchinterest, but I could not have known anything about my father because hedivorced my mother and left for good when I was only fourteen months old! As asmall part of a detailed investigation by the Aerial Phenomena ResearchOrganization I underwent a battery of psychological tests by a number ofindependent experts which indicated \"normality and no deviations that wouldpoint toward psychosis,\" \"a normal pattern of scores,\" \"no indication of aneurotic or psychotic reaction\" and concluded with, \"a picture of a healthyyoung man, with a good sense of self-awareness, a tendency toward skepticism,and an inner strength or emotional stability.\"Jeff Wells did not request that the story be killed as he claims; it waspublished with his byline and with more of his typical distortions such asclaiming that the ray which struck me made me vanish into thin air, as if thestory needed any sensationalizing.\"Antimatter\" has been good for laughs but I'm not laughing at this one. Omni hasa lot of fine writers to fill its pages without resorting to yellowcontributions from ex-Enquirer reporters. Carol Burnett I'm not, but I sincerelyhope you will allow me to refute this gratuitous slander against me.Sincerely,Travis WaltonI wasn’t aware of the wide liberties allowed to magazine editors in rewritingletters for publication. In their defense, they cite space limitations,justifying their changes by claiming they preserve the intended meaning. You bethe judge of whether my intended meaning was preserved. In the June 1982“Letters” column Omni printed:No Laughing MatterJeff Wells's UFO Update [\"Antimatter,\" March 1982] was the most ludicrous packof lies yet written about my November 1975 experience. Wells did not see me ormy brother \"staggering\" drunk. My brother and I did not—and do not—drinkalcohol.I underwent a battery of psychological tests by a number of independent expertsthat indicated no neurosis or psychosis. \"Antimatter\" has been good for laughs,but I am not laughing at this one. I am not Carol Burnett.Travis WaltonSnowflake, Ariz.Enormous compression, but the abridgment held up—until the Carol Burnett line.They took my remark, in which I was saying in effect that “I don’t haveBurnett’s financial power or star clout to do to you what she did to theEnquirer, but please correct this offense by printing my letter,” and changed itto “I am not Carol Burnett”! To me it looks as if Omni were trying to make melook nutty, as if I had an identity delusion, or believed Wells had called meCarol Burnett or was trying to say “Carol Burnett is guilty of this but I’mnot.” Unintentional, or not? You be the judge.Anyway, the main point relevant to the present discussion is that in Jeff Wells’Skeptical Inquirer version, he describes Duane as a “total abstainer” (true) andclaims “the psychiatrists were rolling drunk” (untrue). In his Omni version herepeats, almost word for word, his florid description of Duane from hisnewspaper article:He was one of the meanest and toughest-looking men I’ve ever seen—in his latetwenties, a rodeo professional and amateur light-heavyweight fighter, a totalabstainer, broad shouldered, T-shirt packed with muscle, chiseled-down hips, bowlegged, eyes full of nails, tense, unpredictable. He leaned against a pick-uptruck with a gun rack in the cabin and raked us with beams of cunning and hatredas strong as the flash from the spaceship that had pole-axed his brother as thewitnesses fled in terror.Except, in Omni, he carefully omitted “total abstainer.” Then Wells creativelyedited the part about the two psychiatrists from the earlier version which, torepeat, went: “Their methods were unique. The next day the four of themdisappeared into a room, and soon a waiter headed in there with two bottles ofcognac. At the end of it the psychiatrists were rolling drunk, but they hadtheir story and the brothers were crestfallen.” In the Omni article he changedit to: “Then a psychiatrist flew in from Colorado. He locked himself in a roomwith Travis, the cowboy and a bottle of cognac. When the three staggered outhours later, he had his story.”These stories came out more than five years after the event, but only monthsapart. In that short interval the two bottles of cognac became one, the twopsychiatrists reduced to one, and Duane and I went from “total abstainer” and“crestfallen” to staggering drunk. (And, of course, the beautiful girl with thekinky sex problem vanished without a trace.) Gives one a notion of hisjournalistic accuracy, doesn’t it? I wouldn’t be surprised to learn of theexistence of more bizarre recyclings of the article published elsewhere. Suchare the sorts of sources PJK relies on. But then what else would you expect in asmear campaign?PJK draws many unjustified conclusions from a taped interview with my brotherDuane and Mike Rogers, conducted by ufologist Fred Sylvanus out near the siteduring the search for me. PJK sees sinister implications in my brother’srepeated assertions: “they don’t kill people”; “he’ll be all right”; “he’shaving the experience of a lifetime”; “he’ll turn up”; “I don’t believe he’shurt”; “I refuse to put the beings or the craft or whatever you want to call itin the role of villains”; “if they wanted to make war they’d of destroyed uslong ago.”In light of Duane’s character, anyone can see that he was not talking like a UFObuff. He sounded as anyone might if he was trying to convince himself thatsomeone he cared greatly for was all right. Particularly when he contradictshimself by showing concern about the effectiveness of the ground search.The context PJK ignores is that this was after three exhausting days offruitless searching and unsolicited advice from ufologists and UFO buffs. Mybrother had grilled my coworkers, and he’d had days to face the facts of thesituation. So, astounding as the conclusion was, the only alternative was toaccept that I’d been taken.PJK implies my family could only have avoided PJK’s suspicion (actually hewould’ve seen every possible reaction as suspicious) by steadfastly disbelievingit. But that would’ve been irrational. Remember Sherlock Holmes: “When you’veeliminated all other possibilities, whatever remains, however unlikely, is theanswer.”Duane sounded more like someone at a funeral repeating that their dearlydeparted is safe in the hands of angels, free at last, at least not feeling painany longer, gone to a better place, etc. A relative pacing a hospital waitingroom might have a similar tone to their remarks. The parent of a missing childoften takes the position, “She’s safe, I just know it,” or “I wish I was withher.” If his reaction had occurred in any similar situation, not involving UFOs,his optimism would not be questioned even for a second. Granted, differentpeople take things differently, some might wail and scream, but would Duane? Ina sense, Duane’s bravado was exactly what PJK claims was lacking—a show ofconcern. If he were truly unconcerned about my well-being, he wouldn’t have keptbringing up the subject in that way. Another factor of the context of this tapethat PJK ignores is that after three days of endlessly talking about the samesubject, people’s areas of emphasis naturally change. Every single conversationwould not cover the entire range of their thoughts and feelings on the subject.Their first words about it might be most representative of their reaction. But,after a while, each conversation would add a fresh perspective, not be arepetition of their first words.This is especially true of heavy emotional content. Three or four sleeplessnights and tension-filled days alone would tend to make people a little numb. Inseveral instances where friends have lost a close loved one and I was unable togo offer support for several days, I was surprised at how unemotional they hadalready become. People get cried-out, and if they don’t cry, they getgrieved-out, or worried-out. But rarely do people maintain their peak ofemotional expression for days on end. Especially people prone to withholdingemotion and avoiding the betrayal of anything that might be construed asweakness.When Sylvanus asked Duane if he’d read much about flying saucers, from thecontext one can tell that Duane felt his knowledge was being challenged by theufologist, that justification for all his rationalizing and philosophizing aboutme being okay was being questioned. Duane had quite a swagger to him in thosedays, and he wasn’t one to be outdone, especially when challenged. He had anexpression he used, whenever people asked him how he was doing—with a bigconfident grin he’d shoot back, “Better’n anybody!” Duane was a boxer, andMuhammad Ali’s braggadocio was widely known, so it was something people took asa kind of half-jesting style that was understood. So, although Duane hadn’t everread a single book on the subject, he answered, “As much as anybody,” but thenquickly qualified it with, “It’s just one of those things.”In his “analysis” of the Sylvanus tape PJK wrote (underlined, all caps): “BUT ATNO TIME DURING THE HOUR-LONG INTERVIEW DID ROGERS EXPRESS THE SLIGHTEST CONCERNOVER WHETHER TRAVIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN INJURED OR KILLED ...” And, in his book:“Yet never once during the sixty-five-minute interview did either Duane Waltonor Rogers express the slightest concern over Travis’s well-being. Quite theopposite! [emphasis PJK’s] Nor did Rogers ever voice any regret that he decidedto drive off and abandon his good friend Travis, leaving him to a supposedlystrange fate. When Rogers described the appearance of the UFO to Sylvanus henever once used words like ‘frightening’ or ‘ominous.’ ”No, and he didn’t use words like xenophobia or inauspicious, either. But he diduse the word “scared” repeatedly. PJK deceives again.People are so often tricked by PJK quoting or citing some clear documentationlike a tape because they don’t expect there’s a need to question the accuracy ofhis quotations and summations. Mike’s references to being afraid are scatteredall through his account: “. . . a deep, throbbing feel to it—that’s what scaredme more than anything.” “Nobody ever got out of the truck but Walton, we wereall too scared to do anything. . . .” “. . . I looked away because I was scaredand a couple of the guys had already said, you know, let’s get the hell out ofhere.” “. . . I drove the truck too fast, I panicked and I almost wrecked thetruck.” “We were scared, everybody was yelling, everybody was shouting, myfingers turned numb, my feet were numb, my stomach was in a ball. . . .” Theseare just a few examples, clear proof that PJK deliberately misrepresented whatwas actually said.Mike’s description of the craft as something perfect and beautiful reminds me ofthe sort of hypnotic, deadly fascination I’ve read about in descriptions ofsomeone staring transfixed at some brightly colored poisonous serpent orsomething else of complex, yet imposingly dangerous, appearance. The paradox ofthe combination of beauty and danger was what prompted Mike’s musing.Mike expressed concern for my well-being many times in the interview, and in avariety of ways. Although the issue of his driving off and leaving me behind wasa touchy one between him and Duane, who was present, he even commented on that.Mike’s expression of being aggravated because he believed (mistakenly) that hisrepeated suggestion to use bloodhounds had been ignored until it became too lateto use tracking dogs, and his dissatisfaction with the effectiveness of thesearch, certainly implied concern. (To prove that my ellipses are not tricky,like PJK’s, doubters can arrange to listen to a copy of the tape.) Scattered allthrough the tape, in no particular order, are the following: “. . . we better goback in case he’s hurt and bleeding. . . . we’re going to have to go back. Iagreed, you know, we couldn’t leave him over there if he was hurt, which hecertainly looked to me like he received some kind of [pause] something, somekind of injury, I don’t know if it just stunned him or hurt him. Since wehaven’t found him we don’t know but [big sigh, pause]. . “. . . no tracks, nopieces of clothing, no blood, no nothing. I mean there was no trace of it, andthere was no trace of him. Some of the guys started crying; I remember I startedcrying . . .” Again, just a few examples from among others.No fear, “concern,” or regret? Of course, it wasn’t enough for PJK to tell hisreaders blatant falsehoods about the part of the Sylvanus tape he didn’ttranscribe. PJK’s partial transcript contained a passage in which Duane said, “.. . he got directly under the object and he’s received the benefits for it.” PJKthen quotes Sylvanus as saying, “You hope he has!”—after which PJK interjectsthis comment: “Listening to the foregoing portion of the tape-recordedinterview, it is clear from the tone of Sylvanus’s voice that he is much moreconcerned over Travis’s well-being than either Rogers or Duane Walton.” Or soyou would be led to believe. Except for the fact that it was not Sylvanus’svoice expressing this concern. The one who said, “You hope he has!” was inreality Mike Rogers!PJK’s transcribing and “analyzing” the tape was supposed to prove Mike and Duanewere suspiciously unconcerned, and talking like UFO buffs. The one comment thatPJK judges to be “clear from the tone of. . . voice that he is much moreconcerned” actually came from Mike, proving quite the opposite of PJK’s wholepoint! The few remarks Duane did make about UFOs did not show how “well-versedin UFO lore” he was, but were in fact sufficiently inaccurate to prove again theopposite of PJK’s contention.After days of unsuccessful searching my mother logically concluded that I wasn’ton this earth and agreed with termination of the search. PJK criticizes this byimplying it was something only a true believer (or, variously, a conspirator)would do. Then he contemptuously criticizes as a waste the action Duane and Miketook in getting the search reinstituted, instead of seeing it as an expressionof concern, which he had claimed was lacking. He repeatedly switches back andforth between characterizing the people involved as either conspirators or truebelievers. He uses whatever most negative depiction seems to work best at themoment, in total disregard of the inconsistency with his other representations.How could this attributing of Mike’s words to Sylvanus be a mistake? PJK hadread Bill Barry’s accurate transcript of this passage, which properly attributesthat comment to Mike. And I've listened to the tape—it’s clear. There is nomistaking the voice of a twenty-eight-year-old Mike for the voice of the elderlySylvanus (now deceased).If these aren’t tricks, if his switching the attribution of concern, and the“bleeding”/“breathing” accusation, were both actually errors, it speaks volumesabout PJK’s mindset (and lack of accuracy) throughout his work. His penchant formisattribution even extends to videotape, where he can see people’s lips move.He published a transcript of a portion of the Larry King Live where heattributes to Mike a remark that I made. How many of the transcripts hepublishes of his recorded phone calls have similar “convenient” errors? PJK’swords “accidentally” ending up coming from the mouth of those called in histelephone “research”? Without originals we may never know.It is ironic that so many of his Ten Ufological Principles boil down to say thatpeople see what they expect to see, what they want to see, what they’repsychologically predisposed to see. I believe that these observations abouthuman nature are often accurate. The irony lies in the extent to which thisappears to dominate PJK’s own thinking on the subject. His mind fills in theblanks and “quickly supplies the details”—as he says of UFO witnesses.If he’d applied his Ufological Principle Number 7, he wouldn’t have beenattacking the characters of Mike and Duane, and would have focused on the tapeportion where Mike describes witnessing the government man taking radiationreadings at the site. Yet PJK has never written a single word about suchphysical traces, not even to attack them. The tape also contains references toconcern about a government cover-up, two days before the polygraph tests, whichthey were calling for on the tape, along with other tests like sodium pentothal(“truth serum”). An objective investigator would have focused on signs likethese, and the call for tracking dogs, instead of ignoring them to carp about afictional lack of concern.PJK keeps harping on the nonsense that the “entire Walton family are UFO buffs,”when he is very poorly informed concerning my family. He calls Duane the “oldestson” when he is the second oldest son and the third oldest child. He put aphotograph in his book with a caption identifying my sister, Alison, as Duane’swife. Except for a passing reference, in one of his less circulated papers, toDon tearing apart the slash-piles looking for a body, he has never made a singlespecific mention of my other three siblings, yet writes repeatedly of the wholefamily’s alleged obsession.Speaking of photos, he has a habit of publishing uncomplimentary photos of histargets, often taken from video footage, where you can catch a bad frame.Apparently, he especially prefers mid-blink, which gives just the impressionhe’s after. The odds would be much against catching that many people inmid-blink purely by chance.The phoniest photo PJK uses in his book is one of McCarthy with a deceptivecaption that says, in part, that McCarthy “. . . examines the original chartsfrom the lie detector test he gave Travis Walton shortly after he reappeared.”(Yeah, too shortly.) The single chart McCarthy is looking at could not be myoriginal charts. The chart he is looking at is still in the machine with theink-tracing needles still on the lines, and the paper still attached to the mainroll. Immediately after my test, McCarthy removed the charts from the machine,rolled them up and put them away, and no photos were taken (as PJK specificallymentioned on page 186 of the same book!). McCarthy’s machine in the photo isdesk-mounted in a built-in mode. When he tested me it was in portable mode,which is a suitcase-like accessory used for carrying and mounting the device forroad jobs. The photo was taken in some office, not the motel room where the testactually took place. The picture is just a transparent attempt at atabloid-style dramatization of McCarthy’s “gross deception” claim quoted in thebogus caption.Riddled with deliberate alterations of the truth as his case is, numerous asthese examples are, his most-used tactic is still the omission of data. We willprobably never know the full extent of what lies on his cutting-room floor, butthere are many more examples of things kept just barely out of frame of thepicture he portrays to his readers.PJK scratched deep in efforts to dig up dirt on those he attacked. I learnedthat he telephoned all the bars in town, looking for bad stories about me, butwhen they told him I never went in there, PJK hid this fact. He called neighborsand former employers. When these people told PJK good things about me, hewithheld this information, too.In a November 8, 1976, white paper criticizing Jim Lorenzen of APRO’s handlingof my case, PJK wrote, “An investigative reporter, or a UFO investigator, has aduty to report all significant facts [emphasis his] he uncovers, even if somerun contrary to his own beliefs.” Recall the line of Peguy’s that PJK is so fondof quoting: “He who does not bellow the truth when he knows the truth makeshimself the accomplice of liars and forgers.” And one he takes from BenFranklin: “Half the truth is often a great lie.”He would never bring himself to mention that my mother was several timesnominated and once voted Woman of the Year by the chamber of commerce for hervolunteer work and community service. But he kept digging until he found someonewho, jealous of our family’s use of the Bear Springs cabin, was willing to makespurious attacks on my mother’s character. Oh, he “ignored characterendorsements of the principals involved” all right—if, and only if, they were onthe affirmative side of the issue.But on the other hand, he actively and enthusiastically went looking forcharacter attacks. He was aware of my scholarship grants from threeuniversities, but kept quiet about it. Others, like Mike’s Forest Serviceassociates, gave positive testimony that went no farther than PJK’s ears. Peoplehad loads of good things to say about Ken Peterson’s character, but PJK neverrepeated any of it.“He who does not bellow the truth when he knows the truth makes himself theaccomplice of liars and forgers.”Nowhere is PJK’s one-sided reporting as demonstrable as in his treatment ofcredentials. He hypes the credentials of my critics and plays down thecredentials of my advocates.PJK falsely claimed that George Pfiefer had only two years’ experience, insteadof his actual five years. He played up Ezell’s four years of polygraphexperience and his brief work for the police, and completely omits the fact,known to him, that Pfiefer had for years been a detective-sergeant with theMiami Police Department in Florida, from which he later retired. Pfiefer hadbeen honored by being specially selected from among the department’s sevenhundred-plus employees, as best-qualified for assignment to the Bureau ofScientific Investigation, and to the Identification Bureau. Part of his dutiesinvolved participating in the training of police recruits—one of whom went on tobecome Miami’s chief of police.Subsequently Pfiefer was Director of Security in the state of Arizona for thelarge corporation National Convenience Stores, before entering private practice.His reputation caused him to be immediately swamped with business, thusprompting the merger with Ezell and Associates. PJK omits reporting that Pfieferwas a charter member of the Arizona Polygraph Association, and a full member ofboth the American Polygraph Association and the California Association ofPolygraph Examiners. His membership in the American Polygraph Association wassponsored by both vice presidents of that organization; and his membership inthe California organization was sponsored by its president.Yet, for McCarthy—who wasn’t even a member of the Arizona PolygraphAssociation—PJK doesn’t fail to mention McCarthy’s American PolygraphAssociation membership. He writes respectfully of “McCarthy’s Arizona PolygraphLaboratory,” but refers to Pfiefer as “operating under the business name ofAssociated Polygraph,” as if Pfiefer’s company’s name were some flimflam alias.In one of his books PJK attacks self-proclaimed UFO witness Dan Fry’scredentials, putting his title—“Dr.”—in quotation marks. PJK goes into detailabout checking on the source of Fry’s Ph.D., the difficulty in actually findingwhat turned out to be a “correspondence school” and his discovery that, “Fromtheir standard application form I learned that anyone could apply for a Ph.D. bysimply submitting a ten-thousand-word thesis and paying a modest fee whichamounted to less than one hundred dollars.”APRO’s investigation of “Dr.” Lester Steward’s academic credentials, which PJKread, followed an almost identical course. However, instead of discreditingSteward as he did Fry, PJK ignores the fact that Steward had tried to passhimself off as an M.D. (he impersonated an M.D. not only to Duane and me, butalso to reporters). And, merely because Steward attacked me, PJK continues totreat him respectfully as the “drug expert” Steward claims to be, when PJK knewSteward had no such formal training at all.PJK discounts the testimony of Dr. Kandell in his dismissal of the drug-tripscenario because Kandell’s specialty was pediatrics, even though Kandell was abona fide M.D. with years of legitimate training and experience. How muchdrug-addiction experience or training could PJK’s “drug expert,” Steward, trulyhave, when the school from which he supposedly obtained his training had been inexistence for only two years? As Steward so grossly misrepresented his academiccredentials, how could anyone honest prefer Steward’s pronouncements to those ofa reputable, genuine medical doctor? If Steward had been one of my advocates,rest assured PJK would have declared Steward’s “expert opinion” as bogus as hiscredentials. He’d have skewered Steward. PJK discounts the witness reliabilityof astronauts and experienced pilots but takes the word of flakes at face valueif he thinks they support his case.PJK omits mentioning Dr. Rosenbaum’s status in court as an expert witness on thevalidity of the polygraph, when Rosenbaum rejects the validity of the McCarthytest. (PJK does quote Rosenbaum’s statement, but then claims that my book, TheWalton Experience (which he falsely and repeatedly implies was ghostwritten),“omits Dr. Rosenbaum’s other conclusion; that Travis ‘did not go on a UFO.’ ”)Another PJK falsehood. What he claims I omitted appears on page 139.PJK recounts Rosenbaum’s “transitory psychosis” theory for the opportunity toreflect negatively on my mental status, even though he ultimately (correctly)discounts it as flawed because the theory fails to account for the witnesses,the ray, and my urine sample. (PJK is very equivocal about the urine sample: Ifthere are no drugs in it, then it can’t be mine; but if there are no acetones init, it is mine and proof that I wasn’t aboard the craft because I have noconscious memory of being fed.)APRO performed two psychiatric examinations on me, ruling out any kind ofpsychological abnormality (a fact PJK was aware of but, again, carefully omits).Dr. Harold Cahn, a physiologist and APRO’s consultant in parapsychology,administered the Rorschach (inkblot) test and filed a report with APRO whichindicated I was “not highly suggestible” and possessed a good, normal, basicpersonality structure. The Minnesota Multi-phasic Personality Inventory,conducted by Lamont McConnell (who holds an M.S. in psychology), indicated“normality and no deviations that would point toward psychosis.”The results of both tests were reviewed for further interpretation by Dr. R. LeoSprinkle, who was APRO’s Consultant in Psychology and also Director of theDivision of Counseling and Testing at the University of Wyoming. In his reporthe wrote in summary: “The profile is viewed as a normal pattern of scores; thereis no indication of a neurotic or psychotic reaction.” And in conclusion: “. . .the MMPI profile of Travis Walton provides a picture of a healthy young man,with a good sense of self-awareness, a tendency toward skepticism, and an innerstrength or emotional stability.”The real reason PJK discounts Rosenbaum’s theory is not its contradiction of thefacts, but that at its core it depends on my belief in what happened to me:acceptance of which would overturn the McCarthy test, the Forest ServiceContract Motive Theory, and all that vast web of interrelated innuendo.PJK rejects Rosenbaum’s two major points: his spurious psychosis theory and theinvalidation of the McCarthy test. Then he hypocritically uses Rosenbaum’sclaims that “the Waltons are UFO freaks,” a notion Rosenbaum got from the media.Then PJK reprints an article falsely claiming Rosenbaum was rolling drunk whengathering this “reliable” data. He quotes from Rosenbaum’s recounting of mychildhood history, which doesn’t remotely match up with any of the easilyverified facts about where I really lived, when I moved, facts about my father,his work, my mother, her work, etc. Had PJK admitted checking enough to find outhow ridiculously erroneous the false childhood history was, he wouldn’t havebeen able to use the other Rosenbaum statements he selectively included. Flipflop flip flop. Sift and sort. Cut and paste.It really wouldn’t hurt my case if Rosenbaum’s entire testimony were rejected asunreliable, because the validity of the McCarthy test has been rejected by abouta dozen other experts of much higher standing.PJK drew similar “family of UFO buffs” stories from Dr. Kandell, who PJK quotesas saying he heard me say such things during his medical examination of me—anexamination for which he wrote an official report wherein he stated thatdiscussion was confined to the medical aspects of my condition. In his June 20,1976, paper PJK said, “. . . I asked him whether Travis or Duane had indicatedany previous interest in UFOs during his November 11 discussions andexamination. Dr. Kandell replied: ‘They admitted to that freely, that he[Travis] was a ‘UFO freak,’ so to speak. . . . He had made remarks that if heever saw one, he’d like to go aboard.’ ”I certainly never said any such thing to Kandell. This is another example of thesneaky quote out of context. Don’t believe PJK’s quotes for one second. Idiscover deception has occurred nearly every time I get access to the context ofhis quotes or the material substituted for by his three-dot ellipses. An actual(to the extent it can be trusted, since it was written by PJK),little-circulated transcript of the conversation from which the quote above wastaken proves that PJK knew all along that Dr. Kandell was like McCarthy andRosenbaum in simply repeating what the newspapers and TV had been screaming. Thequote sounds certain, without qualification, right? Look what was trimmed offafter PJK’s question about the family’s prior interest:Dr. Kandell: They admitted to that freely, that he was you know, a “UFO freak, ”so to speak. He’s interested in it.PJK: Which one?Dr. Kandell: Travis. He had made remarks before that if he ever saw one, he’dlike to go aboard, this and that. So, yes, that was mentioned. That was out.PJK: When was that? Was that when you and Dr. Saults were there or when more ofthe people were there?Dr. Kandell: No, that was, I think, subsequently, it came out. I don’t knowwhether it was that Friday night, or it could have been that I, that it was inthe newspapers, that somebody else might have mentioned it.PJK: But you heard it from their own lips?Dr. Kandell: I think so. I think so. I can’t be 100-percent positive. But if Ididn’t, it was discussed. They didn’t deny that. That wasn’t denied.PJK was putting pressure on him to say he heard these things directly from me.But still Dr. Kandell essentially admitted that he’d heard it elsewhere, fromthe newspapers or something and ends lamely with the statement that no onespecifically spoke to the contrary. Tricky.Anyone writing to PJK would be well advised to be certain to keep a carbon copy.If you can’t tape it yourself, anyone speaking to him in person or on the phoneneeds to be certain to speak like a paranoid politician—in precise sound bites.Make sure that if you qualify your statements, do it within the sentence, not asan afterthought.Of course, as with the Bill Barry quote, it’s nearly impossible to speak in away that will prevent distortion by those three little dots, the ellipsis.Imagine what could be done to “I admit that I was shocked when someone robbedFort Knox” by substituting an ellipsis for the middle four words.Also one must be constantly aware of how their words will look bare, devoid ofthe richness of inflection, tone, and emotion normally used to communicate somuch of what we really think. Take any one of PJK’s quotes and read it aloudwith various emotions: cagey hesitancy, prosecutorial stridence, offhandcarelessness, emphatic certainty, hollow insincerity, a mocking or questioningtone implying “someone else believes this but not me.”To further illustrate how a mere transcript can strip away meaning, repeat thesentence, “I never said I saw him steal money,” and one at a time emphasize thefirst word, the second, the third, and so on until the stress has been placed oneach of the eight words. Shows you what’s lost in a transcript, doesn’t it?Reading song lyrics doesn’t make us feel like dancing. And this doesn’t begin toshow how an infinite variety of things said in a surrounding context candramatically alter, even reverse, the meaning of those few words enclosed inquotes.But wait, there’s more. In PJK’s book, UFOs: The Public Deceived, he refers tothat very same November 11 medical examination, this time trying to build theopposite case—that the Waltons were being closemouthed and secretive, ratherthan freely speaking of eagerness for a UFO ride: . . Duane asked that thedoctors limit themselves to a cursory examination and not to ask Travis for anydetails of his UFO experience, and the doctors complied. Kandell told me thatTravis would reply cryptically to questions ‘but he really did not expound onanything voluntarily.’ ” (“Cursory” is PJK’s word, not Duane’s and notaccurate.)Apparently PJK was moved by criticism of his earlier Kandell “quotes” (ironicthat for PJK we have to put “quote” in quotation marks) to retreat to a positioncloser to the truth. Somehow, though, in his descriptions of the same encounterwe went from raving on about UFOs, to saying almost nothing at all. The truthis, Kandell did ask a little about the experience aboard the craft but only sofar as it related to my condition, as mentioned in his medical report.Kandell also wrote: “He appeared anxious, though calm; spoke slowly and showedno emotions at all, i.e. his affect [sic] was extremely flat.” “A drug screenrun by the Maricopa County Medical Examiner’s Office, Toxicology Division,revealed no detectable drugs in that initial specimen submitted.” “His emotionalstate suggested that he had been through a disturbing experience.”Consistent criteria? Or flip flop? PJK points with great suspicion to the factmy mother failed to invite the town marshal into her Snowflake home at one timeduring the search, implying she was hiding me there. (She’d just become fed upwith reporters and law officers—many of whom, including Flake, had already beenallowed in—getting her very upset and invading her privacy.) Yet PJK alsoattacked her for being too believing in her remarks. Which is it, PJK, was she awide-eyed believer, or was she in on some kind of conspiracy?Then elsewhere PJK turns around and claims I was hiding twenty-five miles awayat Bear Springs. PJK saw it as very suspicious that, in the crisis, my motherleft the remote cabin which had no phone, to return home to be near her familyand word of what was going on. If she had stayed at Bear Springs I’m certainthat PJK would have seen that as suspicious, too.Both his conflicting claims ignore the fact that the Navajo County Sheriff sDepartment knew for certain from the telephone operator’s tip, that my call forhelp had come from Heber, miles from either alleged hideout. PJK knew this—hereported it elsewhere in his book. (Sheriff Gillespie’s wife was a formertelephone operator and in the early days of his career the Sheriff s Departmenthad no dispatcher but instead had a big red light on top of the phone-companybuilding up on the hill, which they would turn on as a signal to call in.) Andmy mother passed a polygraph test as to her innocence of all PJK’s charges,which also included specific questions concerning this issue. Recall that hedeclined her polygraph challenge, obviously not really believing his chargesagainst her.I guess the man’s attitude could be summed up as the logical fallacy ofblack-or-white. Everyone who has any part of upholding the validity of a UFOcase is black, and anyone who attacks it is white, and there is no gray area.PJK speculated (before release) that the movie would contain elements concerninggenetic experimentation described in other recent cases which were not presentin my original account. His prediction missed; the movie contained no such“angles.” But if it had, it would have been a false hit. Because it’s simplyuntrue that my first book made no such mentions, there were, references toimplants, fetuses, reproduction, and genetic engineering.One of his favorite words was “eager.” When abducted, I was “eager.” If anypro-UFO person appears on television, they do so “eagerly.” He continuallyaccuses Pfiefer, me, and many other witnesses and investigators, of wanting tobecome “celebrities.” Contrast this with his constant plying the media with hismailings and his continual requests to be interviewed, to rebut this or commenton that.He just as frequently accuses witnesses and investigators of deceiving thepublic, not just for attention, but for profit. With his four books, lectures,newsletter, etc., we can see that PJK’s position has not left him unsullied bygain. I’ve been told that he owns an apartment complex, a big, oceangoing boat,and makes frequent trips to places like the Bahamas. With the many falsehoodsexposed here, Mike has said publicly that in a sense it is PJK who has beenshown to be a UFO hoaxer.Actually, humor aside, it is completely invalid from a logical standpoint tomake the test of virtue for someone on any side of any issue be whether theyprofit from their position. Like everything, it bears examination, but it’s noacid test. Such a standard falls apart if some Hitleresque zealot preachesgenocide and asks nothing for himself from his followers, while a dedicatedphysician earns a very comfortable living for himself and his family. This isAmerica, we believe in capitalism, free enterprise, and all that. If PJK hasmade some money, fine. The key is that he not be hypocritical in applying astandard to others he doesn’t want applied to himself.I want to repeat my request that the facts of this matter be evaluated solely onthe merits of the data and reasoning. No matter what the personal estimation isof a person who resorts to such tactics and reasoning patterns, the truth mustbe determined independently of such considerations. I don’t think I’d have agreat deal of trouble whipping up such emotion, if that’s what I wanted, becausehe already does this to himself. The more objective ufologists actually have asort of grudging respect for some of the other major skeptics and debunkers, butnot for PJK. No one else seems to engender the kinds of strong negative feelingshe does.Even those with initially sympathetic ears wind up becoming quite disaffected:skeptical people like Town Marshal Sanford Flake, Forest Service contractingofficer Maurice Marchbanks, reporter Richard Robertson, and several others Icould name, came to develop strong negative reactions to his approach. Asnegative as these people have been about my case, they came away using wordslike “biased” and “unfair” about PJK’s modus operandi.Bill Barry described it thusly: “His method of dealing with their evidence washarsh, smug, superior, unfair, and sometimes worse. And when push came to shove,and evidence could not be impugned, [PJK] simply ignored it and omitted it fromconsideration. So his investigation of UFOs finally suffered from severalinterrelated defects: there was a personal taint of obnoxia about it; it failedto deal with the complete subject; its conclusion was no more substantial thanthe premise that had spawned it.”Perhaps it’s his habit of badgering people who thought they were on his side.Even people completely neutral end up shoved one way or the other by the feelingof being cornered, cross-examined like a hostile witness, everything for therecord, everything for that isolated quote, trapped into choosing sides in abattle that wasn’t theirs. Those shoved to my side are sometimes surprised tofind themselves upholding an idea of a sort they never would have expected theycould ever back up. Those shoved to his side seem vaguely guilty or to faintlyresent it somehow, like they feel used or manipulated. Yet PJK criticizes modernUFO researchers for supposedly doing this very thing in surveys, interviews, oreven during hypnosis: leading, suggesting, pressuring subjects for the desiredanswers.The rational mind is neither credulous nor skeptical—it is objective.Objectivity means having no bias either for or against an issue. Our only“bias,” if you wish to call a priority or goal a “bias,” should be for thetruth—things as they are, to the best of our ability to determine it.If we are objective we believe only those things proven true and we onlydisbelieve those things proven false. In the real world these extremes are rare;those indeterminate things in between have to be assigned relative weight on thebasis of defensible criteria. The error of both the gullible and the skepticalis to try to lump too much into one of the absolute categories at the extremes.We can’t logically categorize the unproven as necessarily untrue, any more thanwe can categorize everything that is not disproved as necessarily true. Withthis understanding, the term “skeptic” is as derogatory as the term “gullible.”Both suffer a form of blindness. Each is a side of the same coin—the error ofthe criteria for belief.Ironically, the burden of proof lies with my critics. I am perfectly aware, andagree, that extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. So ordinarily thesituation would be reversed. But I am the one who has been pursued in this. Bythe time I was returned, the choice of going public about it or not was out ofmy hands. I have never sought out an interview in my life. They’ve come to me.And so have my attackers. It is they who claim. They who draw conclusions. Theywho make pronouncements that prove to be without foundation, withoutjustification, without logical defense.Years ago, from the very start, I frankly acknowledged the lack of indisputableproof. I informed my readers that I basically laid the material on the table, tojudge as they saw fit. It was my critics who claimed to provide them withanswers and conclusions—even proof.And again, over two decades later, I put the same limits on what I ask. I don’task for belief. For someone not privy to my perspective, such a conclusion mightnot be justified by the data available to you. You have to first allow anypossibility. (This means considering all things that are possible—notconsidering that all things are possible, because they aren’t.) Then I ask onlyfor a fair appraisal of the facts.I have pointed the way for those looking for more facts, more documentation. Youcan find it here if you wish to rely on my word, or go on and verify it foryourself if you want. Please take a minute to scan back through all thehalf-truths, distortions, and false charges leveled against me. Then askyourself if you would ever trust their source as reliable concerning anyinformation.In looking over the case presented by my critics, do the words thorough,accurate, scientific, fair, rational, or consistent spring to mind? It is theywho claim science and logic as their yardstick. I have tried to apply thesevalues as best I can, but in reality it is their claim. Just as they claim tojudge by these standards, it is their burden to be judged by them.I am no logician and I’m no scientist. And the reader of these words is alsounlikely to be either. But everyone has the right—no, the obligation—to use thebest available standards and criteria in judging anything in life. The moreimportant the answer, the more stringent your criteria better be.Look back at the hail of hot barbs that have been fired at me, raining down onmy life for decades. Want to trade places? The miracle is, I’m still standing.Trial by fire. I’ve gained some unique and precious insight, but at a price Idoubt anyone could begin truly to comprehend or willingly pay. It’s noexaggeration when I say that people’s reaction to what happened nearlyovershadows the experience itself. That’s saying a lot, but I could yet drop theword “nearly.” Ironically, PJK’s second book attacking me began with: “This bookis dedicated to those who will needlessly bear mental scars for the rest oftheir lives because of the foolish fantasies of a few.”I’ve always been struck by the extraordinary incidence of irony in situationsarising out of my experience. One is that my experience, which has come to beknown as Fire in the Sky, was attacked in two hardcovers published by PrometheusBooks. PJK and company have more in common with Procrustes than with Prometheus.Prometheus was the Titan of Greek religion who stole fire from heaven and gaveit to man. And, for having brought this metaphorical gift of fire to meremortals, Zeus sentenced him to be bound to a big rock on Mount Caucasus and beendlessly tormented by a vulture daily ripping at and consuming his liver, whichwould then regrow.I leave it to history to decide who is truly the Prometheus in this episode ofmy life story, and who are the vultures.I present these issues to the public for their judgment. My statements include arebuttal of PJK’s charges, but it is not a reply to him. Not after decades ofvicious and unfair attacks, with never a single direct word from him. He has hadample opportunity to prove himself completely unworthy of debate. Conspicuous inthis is the ugly prominence of his use of personal ad homineni attacks on methat are completely irrelevant to the issue. PJK’s unworthiness of a fair andopen discussion is due to his demonstrated lack of fairness, right on the faceof it, by publishing and sending his baseless assertions to almost everyone.Everyone except the person they were about, the one person in the best positionto most easily show they were wrong, if he’d been the least bit interested inprior verification or fact-checking. This is not a matter of pride, or ofwanting to avoid “dignifying by reply”—it’s simply a matter of not wasting timeon something so utterly futile. You can’t teach a pig to sing—it wastes yourtime and annoys the pig. In his exchanges with my proponents and his writings ingeneral, he has amply demonstrated his abysmal lack of intellectual integrityand adherence to even the most rudimentary standards of rational discussion.It’s far too late to undo the harm done. It is far too late for a chat.While PJK deliberately hid favorable data and ducked confrontation of mystrongest points, I have openly confronted his best; each has evaporated underfull illumination. Space prohibits specific refutation of the minutiae of hismaelstrom of misrepresentation (although more thorough and detailed analyses maybe published on a smaller scale). Yes, believe it or not, the foregoing is farfrom being exhaustive of every last detail of his attacks. However, not onepoint in his prosecutorial campaign can stand up to rational analysis, to weighobjectively against the incident’s authenticity. An honest response by PJK wouldinvolve his publicly acknowledging these points, and conceding that he hasn’tmade his case—even if he wishes to persevere in advocating his underlyingpremise that there are no such things as UFOs. However, I predict that in PJK’spublic rantings he will flatly ignore my most decisive points, try to rebut sometrivial points, and pound away at points of still greater obscurity andirrelevance. Perhaps, out of desperation he’ll come up with new, more convolutedad hoc scenarios he’ll tailor to fit the data (or tailor the data to fit thescenario). And when all else fails, the measure of his ineffectuality will beproportionally reflected in even greater reliance on ad hominem characterattacks.He’ll completely sidestep my examples of how he conducted his campaign, myexposure of his falsehoods, deceptive omissions, and distortions. He’ll continueto beg the question of the strongest evidence: physical traces, consistenttestimony from seven eyewitnesses, unassailable polygraph tests.He’ll rave on. Only this time, among those who now have the facts, no one willbe listening."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/TW.jpg]“All I ask is for an objective consideration of all the evidence.
