It began as a chapter in my Oxford BD thesis of 1963. Professor John Emerton encouraged me to develop it, which I did, using the resources of the University of London Sen- ate House Library, during the next ten years. Then, because of the demands of a pastorate and those of teaching at Northern College and the University of Manchester, it was set aside until my retirement in 1993. Bringing it up to date in the light of more recent work on the Psalms, and with the help of the excellent editions of the ancient Near Eastern material that have become available, has been a rewarding task, though perhaps not carried through as thoroughly as I would have wished. Critic s may be able to detect passages that still re fl ect the outlook and concerns of a generation ago. I should like to thank Professors John Emerton, Kenneth Kitchen, Wilfred Lambert and Alan Millard for sharing their expertise so generously with me; Professor David Clines for accepting the study for publication; Dr Adrian Curtis and Dr Jack McKelvey for the loan of books; and the Document Supply Unit of the John Rylands University of Manchester for the trouble they have taken to procure the material I needed. I should also like to thank the Society for Old Testament Study and the Ehrhardt Seminar of the Centre for Biblical Studies in the University of Man- chester for the intellectual stimulus they have provided over many years. The Appendix was read as my fi rst paper to the Society in 1974 and the Ehrhardt Seminar commented on a summary version of this study when I was begin- ning to revise it. The Centre’s kindness in making me an Honorary Research Fellow has greatly facilitated my work and is a privilege I value. Finally, I should like to thank my wife, Yvonne, with whom I have recently celebrated fi fty years of marriage, for not begrudging me the time to fi nish the book.

It is by no means the fi rst of its kind: there have been a number of such studies, some of them detailed and important, in the twentieth century. 1 Hitherto, as is natural, the chief c oncern has been the direct comparison of the psalms with the religious texts of Mesopotamia, Egypt and Canaan. From Mesopotamia and Egypt have come considerable numbers of texts compara- ble to the psalms in literary type, poetic form, content and expression. Thus in 1922 F. Stummer 2 analysed a typical Akkadian šu-illa— a prayer to Šamaš for protection against the misfortune presaged by a serpent 3 —and was able to show that most of its structural elements (address to the deity, description of 1.

Gressmann, G.R. Driver and A.M. Blackman collected together the most striking examples of the way in which Babylonian and Egyptian research shed light on the form and content of the psalms, though without limiting themselves to directly comparable psalm material. 5 In 1928 J. Begrich 6 compared the expressions of trust in the deity in the Akkadian šu-illa and the Israelite individual lament. Gunkel’s commentary on the Psalms, published in 1926, 7 was the fi rst to make detailed use of comparative material, and in the introduction to that commentary, completed after Gunkel’s death by Begrich, 8 the detailed analy- sis of each psalm type is illustrated at every point from the Babylonian and Egyptian literatures. In 1934 C.G. Cumming 9 compared the poetic form, phraseology and religious ideas of the Akkadian and Hebrew hymns, and in 1936 G. Widengren 10 compared the Akkadian and Hebrew laments, using a scheme of analysis similar to that of Stummer, but with much fuller citation of parallels and with special attention to the religious ideas expressed. Widengren may perhaps be criticised for quoting indiscriminately from various types of Akkadian psalm, 11 though it has not been shown that this has led to any serious misinterpretation of the Akkadian material. Some of his discussions are extended and valuable, for example, those on the reason for the praise of the deity (pp. 40-43), the character of God (pp. 49-52, 316-17), 4.

G.R. Castellino’s brief study 12 (1940) is an analysis of typical examples of the Akkadian šu-illa 13 and hymn and their Old Testament counterparts. C. Westermann included in his book on the praise of God in the Psalms, fi rst published in 1953, a brief com- parison with Babylonian and Egyptian psalms. 14 In the study by E.R. Dalglish Psalm 51 is interpreted in detail in the light of the Babylonian penitential psalms (the Sumerian and Akkadian šu-illa and the Sumerian eršahunga , ‘song to appease the heart’); and in that by A. Barucq, 15 after a review of pre- vious work, the Old Testament hymns and prayers are compared in detail with corresponding Egyptian material. There were fewer comparative studies of this kind in the second half of the twentieth century. A notable exception was E.S. Gerstenberger’s Der bittende Mensch , 16 which includes an analysis (pp. 64-112) of the Sitz im Leben of the Babylonian exorcism prayers. The prayers are seen to be part of an elaborate ritual, which included sacri fi ce and various apotropaic acts, diagnosis and therapy. They are the work of the specialists who devised and supervised the ritual. However, they are not part of the of fi cial temple cult: the ritual is carried out within the primary group in which the sufferer lives. Gersten- berger argues (pp. 113-60) that the individual laments in the Psalter were similarly devised by priests or prophets for local use. More recently there has been interest in comparing the structure, themes and occasions of the communal laments of Mesopotamia—the Sumerian city- laments and balag and eršemma laments—with those of the communal laments in the Psalter and Lamentations. This has been prompted by the publication of new editions of the Sumerian material fi rst published early in the twentieth century 17 and by the publication of texts hitherto unavailable. 18 12. G.R.

The biblical Lamentations is a series of laments for the fall of a city; 22 all the laments characteristically contain the elements of praise, descriptive narrative and entreaty. 23 It is clear from the work that has been done that the parallels between the Old Testament psalms and their Mesopotamian and Egyptian counterparts are rarely close enough for us to suppose that the Hebrew psalms are translations or adaptations of foreign texts. The only instance in which direct literary dependence is at all probable is that of Psalm 104 and the Hymn to Aten. 24 Otherwise it would be dif fi cult to maintain that any Hebrew psalmist had direct knowledge of any particular Mesopotamian or Egyptian text. Indeed, several of the scholars mentioned above have pointed out that the differences between the biblical psalms and their ancient Near Eastern counterparts are as striking as the resemblances. Begrich, for example, found the expressions of trust in the Psalms more colourful, less stereotyped than in the Akkadian šu-illa ; whereas in the latter trust was only a subordinate motif, in the Psalms it was dominant. 25 Castellino, contrasting the šu-illa and the individual lament 18.

Landsberger, in a review of Stummer’s book, contrasted the free fl ow of thought of the Psalms with the strict architectonic stru cture, the closely followed rules of style and the conventional themes of Babylonian hymns and prayers; 28 A. Falkenstein and W. von Soden, in the introduction to their selection of Sumerian and Akkad- ian hymns and prayers, drew attention to the polytheism of the Akkadian prayers and their attachment to tradition rather than commitment to one God, and to their lack of national consciousness compared with the Israelite psalms. 29 Barucq had similar observations to make on the differences between biblical and Egyptian prayers: in Egyptian prayers the requests chie fl y concern the life beyond; direct imperatives to the deity are avoided; virtuous conduct is stressed rather than innocence of transgression; Israelite prayers are much more personal. 30 Thus any theory of literary dependence would have to reckon, not only with the very general nature of the resemblances, but also with the pronounced differences. Explanations of Parallels Nevertheless the parallels, general though they are, are numerous enough and close enough to call for some kind of explanation. They cannot be due merely to coincidence. Poetry does not always mean an arrangement of words in half lines that balance one another in meaning, as it does in both Mesopotamia and Israel. It is not inevitable that a religious literature should possess a cate- gory ‘psalm’ that can be subdivided, however roughly, into hymns, laments and thanksgivings. Not all traditions of prayer give a regular place to protes- tations of innocence or loyalty or to the reproachful questions ‘Why?’ and 26. Castellino, Lamentazioni , p. 16. 27.

Resemblances of this character may not suggest direct borrow- ing or adaptation of psalms, but they do suggest a common literary tradition. The explanations usually advanced for these resemblances are of three kinds: direct literary in fl uence; a common proto-Semitic inheritance; indirect literary in fl uence mediated through Canaan. The advocates of direct literary in fl uence have pointed out that there were three periods in Israelite history when psalmists could have had direct knowledge of Babylonian or Egyptian psalm writing. During the exile there were Jews in both Babylonia and Egypt, but this period is not favoured because internal evidence suggests that most psalms are pre-exilic. 31 Judah was open to Assyrian in fl uence from the time of Ahaz onwards; 32 Egyptian in fl uence was probably known from the time of the united monar- chy under David and Solomon. 33 There were periods when Akkadian and Egyptian prayers could have been known to Israelite psalmists at fi rst hand and could have provided them with their basic models. The dif fi culty with this view will always be why the Israelite psalms are not more like their supposed prototypes than they are. The second explanation is that the resemblances are due to a common proto-Semitic inheritance. Just as the Akkadian and Hebrew languages derive from a common stock, so do their verse forms and parallelism, the impulse to express religious feelings in psalms, the general conception of God’s rela- tionship to the world and the serious attitude to sin. 34 Ferris, while conceding that there are ‘some very close similarities in style and substance’ between the Mesopotamian and biblical communal lament traditions, argues that ‘the parallels are best explained as coin cidental and the result of a common experience addressed by a similar, if not common, culture’. 35 While the most general points of resemblance may be satisfactorily explained in this way, however, it hardly covers the many echoes in detail, such as the use of the same metaphors. 36 Furthermore, the individual lament as we have it in the Psalter developed relatively late in Is rael, certainly after the settlement in Canaan: early Hebrew laments are far less elaborate. 37 Even if Israel’s ances- 31.

McHardy (eds.), Hebrew and Semitic Studies Presented to Godfrey Rolles Driver (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1963), pp. 59-71 (61), suggested that the Babylonian exile provided the opportunity for the Mesopotamian laments to in fl uence the composition of Lamentations. 32. 2 Kgs 16; cf.

Comparative Study of the Psalms  7  1 tors, or some of them, had a Mesopotamian origin, they did not bring the psalm types fully grown as part of their inheritance. Hence the third explanation, that the in fl uence of Babylonia and perhaps Egypt as well has been mediated through Canaan, b ecame the most popular. 38 It rests partly on the evidence of the Ras Shamra texts and partly on that of the Amarna letters. The Ras Shamra texts show that there was a Canaanite religious literature, prior to that of Israel in time and much nearer to it in place than the Babylonian and Egyptian li teratures. The mythical texts show numerous parallels with the Psalter in vocabulary, style and mythological content. 39 Nevertheless, only three fragments of what seem to be Canaanite psalms are known, 40 and these are insuf fi cient for any signi fi cant comparison of Israelite and Canaanite psalmody. It has been argued that certain psalms, for example, Psalm 29, are in origin Canaanite psalms which have been adapted to Israelite use, 41 but this remains a matter of inference. The Ras Shamra evidence fails to provide a prototype for the Israelite individual lament as a whole or to illustrate its characteristic motifs. The Amarna letters contain passages whose language and metrical structure are reminiscent of passages in the Hebrew psalms. It has been suggested that these are extracts from hymns to a Canaanite god, and only secondarily applied to the pharaoh to whom the letters are written. 42 This theory of quota- tion from a fi xed source would alone suf fi ce to explain how identical passages can appear in different letters from th e same writer and even from different writers.

No parallels with the Ras Shamra texts have been drawn, and certain phrases are commonly found in Egyptian literature. An alternative suggestion is that there existed ‘collections of approved formulas in Akkadian (with or without Canaanite glosses) for of fi - cial correspondence with the suzerain’. Secular Analogies If it is not regarded as established that the ‘hymnic’ passages in the Amarna letters are secondary applications of hymns to the gods, then we may rather be confronted by an important secular analogy to the psalms. Praise of and prayer to the deity are close enough to praise of and appeals to the king for them to sound very much alike. 43 Either psalms are religious versions of secular discourse, or address to the king is modelled on religious discourse. We shall see reason to believe that the priority lies with the secular situation, but at the moment it is suf fi cient to note that much the same language and many of the same motifs are used in both. It is the purpose of this study to show how this analogy was worked out in detail. Encouragement to study a secular analogy to a feature of biblical religious life comes from the well known comparison fi rst made by G.E. Mendenhall 44 between the biblical covenant Yahweh made with Israel and the treaties made by Hittite kings with their neighbours an d vassals. It is not to be supposed that there has been discovered in the Hittite treaties or in those from Ugarit or Assyria either direct literary sources for any formulation of the biblical cove- nant or evidence of a strict pattern to which the biblical covenant was bound to conform. 45 Nor does the analogy with Hittite treaties of the second millen- 43.

Covenant terminology and ideas can now be detect ed where the word ‘covenant’ is not expressly used. 47 Many of the great words in Israel’s religious vocabulary have their home in the context of the covenant. 48 The comparison of covenant with treaty has thus demonstrated that sometimes the most fruitful analogy for a religious institution is secular rather than religious. Archaeology has hitherto failed to show any example of a religious covenant (i.e. between a nation and its god) outside Israel, but even if it had done so, the secular analogy would still be important in its own right, as adding a new dimension to our understanding of religious institutions: relationship to God is conceived and expressed in terms derived from human social relationships. This had of course been pointed out many times before Mendenhall published his article, 49 but only in a very general way: the signi fi cance of Mendenhall’s contribution and all that has followed from it is that it has demonstrated in detail , in one area at least, the truth of the general statement.

It is useful because it catalogue s the various situations in which prayer would commonly be made. Hans Schmidt 1 used part of the prayer (vv. 31-32) in an attempt to identify the situation lying behind some of the individual laments in the Psalter, the psalms he called ‘the prayers of the accused’. If this approach is at all va lid, then the prayer as a whole will pro- vide a setting for the prayers of the Old Testament, most of which have come down to us as isolated psalms, leaving us to guess at their Sitz im Leben . The prayer is generally regarded as a Deuteronomistic composition. The question of its historical worth hardly concerns us: it does not matter whether Solomon prayed such a prayer, provided that it re fl ects Israelite practice during the period when the Psalms were being composed and used in the temple. More important is the need to allow for Deuteronomistic theological bias, for the doctrine that all obedience receives its reward, all disobedience its punishment, is more fi rmly held by the Deuteronomistic circle than by any other Old Testament writers. Yahweh ‘keeps the covenant with his servants, who walk before him wholeheartedly, and acts loyally towards them’ (1 Kgs 8.23). There can be no suggestion that God will not remain faithful to the covenant on his side; the only troubles contemplated are those which inevita- bly awaken a sense of guilt in the people of Israel. The catalogue of occasions for prayer is therefore de fi cient to the extent that circumstances that might possibly impugn the justice of God ar e omitted. Thus the person who is wrongfully accused is encouraged to pray, but not the person who has suf- fered an inexplicable reversal of fortune. The nation may pray before battle for the help of their God; but in famine, disease and defeat the only acceptable prayer is that which is accompanied by the confession of sin. The limitations of this catalogue of occasions for pray er must therefore be borne in mind. 1. H.

Old Testament Prayers  11  1 Prayer as Appeal for Help Nevertheless, it is interesting to note th at each of the prayers mentioned here relates to some emergency. 2 Nothing is said about regular occasions for prayer or subjects for regular intercession. In later Judaism it would appear that prayer was offered regularly and frequently as a kind of tribute or act of homage, 3 and in the synagogue parts of the Psalter were regularly used in worship. 4 There is also evidence that Israelites of an earlier period prayed in a general way for the welfare of Jerusalem 5 and the safety and judicial wisdom of the king, 6 and even for the welfare of their country of exile. 7 But the prayers of Israel were not originally or predominantly regular devotions, but appeals to God in an emergency. Solomon’s prayer, purporting as it does to catalogue the occasions when prayer would be made, provides some evidence of this, and an examination of the prayers actually recorded in the Old Testament con fi rms it. The Psalter provides the great majority of the recorded prayers. Out of 147 psalms 8 over 80 relate to an emergency, that is, to a situation which has dis- turbed the normal pattern of good behaviour and prosperity which should mark the relations of Israel or the individual Israelite with Yahweh. In eleven of these 9 the emergency is past, and the psalmist is giving thanks for his or his people’s deliverance by Yahweh. In fi ve more 10 the mood of the psalm is one of complete con fi dence, although the danger s till exists. In the remainder, although an expression of con fi dence or assurance may be reached at some point in the psalm, the note of urgent appeal is struck. Thus more than 60 psalms are in the nature of an appeal to God. 11 How large a proportion this is will be seen even more clearly when it is remembered that, of the psalms 2. Cf. 2 Chron. 20.9; and F.

The Psalter gives considerable support to the contention that prayer in Israel was fundamen- tally understood as an appeal to God. We should expect prayers outside the Psalter to fall into this category of pleas for help in time of crisis.

Old Testament Prayers  13  1 ultimately became ‘the hymn book of the second temple’ and of the syna- gogue, might be expected to include as much material as possible which was suitable for regular and general use. Akkadian prayers are likewise predominantly appeals for help in a speci fi c situation rather than petitions for general bene fi ts. Apart from prayers pre- served in inscriptions, which ask for the general welfare of the king con- cerned, 34 nearly all prayers ask for help in some emergency. The common šu- illa , or ‘prayer with uplifted hands’, for example, always contains a complaint and a petition for deliverance. 35 The same characteristic may be noticed in such Hittite prayers as we have. 36 It is less obvious in Sumerian and Egyptian prayers: Sumerian poetry consists chie fl y of of fi cial cult lyrics, 37 and was supplemented in use by the more popular Akkadian prayers; many Egyptian prayers are taken from the walls of tombs, and therefore understandably con- tain rather more general petitions for the welfare of the dead. 38 Criteria for a Secular Analogy We may now discuss the conditions that a secular analogy to such prayers would have to satisfy. There would seem to be four of these: (1) it must be an appeal for help; (2) it must be addressed to a superior from an inferior; (3) it must preferably come from Israel itself or from a society known to have in fl uenced Israel; (4) it must come from a period not too distant in time from that in which most of the Old Testament prayers were composed. The fi rst three of these conditions are self-evident. So indeed is the fourth, but further discussion is necessary because there have been widely divergent views about the date of the psalms, and it cannot be claimed even now that complete certainty or unanimity has b een reached. The fact that the Mes opo- tamian psalms have been discovered in the orderly excavation of ancient sites, and that in some cases they include the names of known historical fi gures, means that they, or at least the copies, can be fairly accurately dated. The fact that the biblical psalms have been handed down together as part of the scrip- tures means that no such evidence for their dating exists. The tradition pre- served in the psalm titles, that many of the psalms are to be associated with David, is of doubtful antiquity and ca nnot be accepted uncritically, without con fi rmatory evidence. However, a Maccabaean dating for the psalms now 34. SAHG B Nos. 24-38; HPD , pp. 504-26. 35. SAHG B Nos. 40-81; HPD , pp. 269-346. 36. CTH 371-89; ANET , pp. 393-401. 37.

References to the king are most naturally explained as hav- ing originated during the time when Israel and/or Judah actually had a king. 41 The use by the prophets of the hymn style or the lament style, in contrast to their normal oracular style, bears witness to the existence of a fl ourishing psalmody. 42 Similarly, the exiles in Babylon knew the ‘songs of Zion’ which they were unwilling to sing (Ps. 137.3-4). 43 Comparison with the Ugaritic literature shows many points of resemblance in vocabulary, style and ideas, and the most likely time for Canaanite in fl uence to have been exercised would have been in the early days of the monarchy, when a Jebusite cultus in Jerusalem was probably absorbed into the worship of Yahweh. 44 The laments in the Psalter stand midway in point of length, elaboration and bal- ance between the brief laments attributed to the Judges period (Josh. 7.7-9; Judg. 6.22; 15.18; 21.3) and the penitential laments of the M accabaean period and later. 45 The lack of precise historical allusions still makes it impos sible to date more than a very few individual psalms even to their century. Psalm 137 certainly belongs to the exile, but other communal laments (Pss. 44; 74; 79) can plausibly be assigned to any of a number of periods of national distress. Nevertheless, the considerations mentioned make it almost certain that most of the psalms, and in particular the individual laments, are pre-exilic. Secular analogies to the prayers in the Psalter should ideally come from Israel itself.

Some analogies between such requests and the individual complaint psalms are drawn out—the structures of both are com- pared (p. 127)—but not as fully or systematically as one might wish. By no means all these passages are urgent appeals for help—they include invita- tions to accept hospitality, proposals for mutual help and co-operation and requests for blessings—and the parties may be of equal status. The examples which are clearly appeals for help from an inferior to a superior are relatively few. 46 Archaeology has not produced many texts of Israelite provenance to supplement these: the Lachish letters alone come to mind. 47 It is therefore necessary to look further a fi eld. Ancient Near Eastern Letters The most important source is that provided by letters . Speeches, oral appeals from one person to another, would be preferable, but understandably these are rarely recorded. 48 Indeed, the Egyptian Eighteenth Dynasty inscription from the tomb of Rekhmire, which details the duties of the vizier, insists that all petitions should be made in writing and not orally. 49 The disadvantages of using letters are not serious. Care was taken that they should not be tampered with and that they should arrive promptly, (Let the scribe) write it down from his dictation, let it be sealed with the cross- shaped (stamp) seal, and let Ahu-dur-enši, the cohort commander of the crown prince, quickly bring it to me by express delivery (ABL 434 [SAA 16, No. 148], ll. R 9-17). 50 In the earliest period (ninet eenth–eighteenth centuries BCE ) they appear to be composed as if they were to be delivered verbally by a messenger, as the opening formula indicates: To Yahdun-Lîm say this: Thus (says) Abî-Samar (ARM, I, 1; DEPM , I, pp. 481-82 [No. 305]). 46.

The chief importance of the written message was that it veri fi ed the verbal message, as a passage from the Hittite treaty between Tudhaliyas II and Šunaššura of Kissuwatna (c. 1400 BCE ) shows: Furthermore: In regard to a tablet which I, My Majesty, send you—a tablet upon which words have been set down—and the words <of> the messenger, which he speaks orally to you—if the words of the messenger are in agree- ment with the words of the tablet, trust that messenger, O Sunaššura. But if the words of the speech of the messenger are not in agreement with the words of the tablet, you, Sunaššura, shall certainly not trust the messenger and shall certainly not take to heart the evil content of that report of his. Again: if the Sun sends you a letter (tablet), in which letter the (record) of a matter has been put down, and the messenger reports (verbally) to you about the matter which he has brought to you: if the words of the messenger agree with the wording of the letter, then you, Sunaššura, are to trust (believe) him. But if the words which you have from the mouth of the messenger do not correspond with the words of the letter, Sunaššura, you are not to trust him; and you shall surely not take any harm in your heart over these words ( CTH 41; HDT , No. 2, §59, p. 24). Kept as a record, it could also be valuable proof of a vassal’s loyalty, as Rib- Hadda of Byblos points out to the pharaoh in one of the Amarna letters: May the king inspect the tablets of his father’s house for the time when the ruler in Gubla was not a loyal servant (EA 74, ll. 10-12). 51.

(Translations of 150 representative Akkadian letters are given in Oppenheim’s Letters .) Not all therefore are appeals for help, but many are. Not all are from inferiors to superiors, but even the replies of superiors sometimes allow the correspon- dent’s appeal to be reconstructed, sometimes even quote it, as in a letter from Suppiluliumaš, the Hittite king, to Niqmaddu, king of Ugarit: Niqmaddu, king of the land of Ugarit, turned to Šuppiluliumaš, Great King, writing: ‘May our Majesty, Great King, my lord, save me from the hand of my enemy. I am the subject of Your Majesty, Great King, my lord. To my lord’s enemy I am hostile, [and] with my lord’s friend I am at peace. The kings are oppressing (?) me’ ( CTH 46; HDT , No. 4, §2, p. 35). Letters may lack the immediacy of direct oral address, but they record in detail the description of events, the enquiries, the promises, the explanations, the arguments used. In the completeness of their record, therefore, they are very suitable for comparison with the biblical prayers.

There are letters from Elam, Anatolia, Syria and Egypt, as well as from many sites in Mesopotamia.

Did Mari in fl uence Israel at a time suf fi ciently near to the composition of the psalms? Parallels between Mari and the Old Testament have frequently been pointed out. 61 These paral- lels, understandably enough, have been chie fl y with the patriarchal narratives. But interest has also been shown in the existence at Mari of functionaries resembling the Old Testament prophets, 62 who do not appear, as far as we know, until a period much later than that of the patriarchs. Admittedly the evidence Mari provides for the antecedents of Hebrew prophecy is important chie fl y because other evidence, nearer in place and time, is lacking. In rela- tion to our own subject, we may say that Mari is too remote to be of primary importance. Nevertheless the resemblances in the fi eld of prophecy suggest that use may be made of parallels from Mari when they are particularly striking. This will not imply any direct in fl uence of Mari on the culture of the Old Testament, but will simply indicate the antiquity and diffusion of the letter writing tradition. (2) The Alalakh tablets provide many points of comparison with the Old Testament, again particularly with the patriarchal period, 63 but only one or two letters can be described as appeals for help. Other documents provide incidental illustrations of particular points. (3) The Amarna letters provide what are almost paradigm cases of the material we are looking for. These we re written during the early fourteenth century BCE , to Amenophis III and Amenophis IV (Akhenaten), from their vassals and of fi cials in Syria and Palestine. 64 Thus many of the letters were written on the soil of Palestine itself, and presumably the same tradition of letter writing would have persisted up to the time of the Israelite settlement, 59.

It is highly likely that we have here a style with which Israel became acquainted, especial ly if Israelite kingship was at all modelled on Canaanite kingship, as the description in 1 Sam. 8.11-18 may well imply. 65 A very high proportion of the Amarna letters consists of appeals for help, because they were written at a time when Egypt’s hold on Syria- Palestine was weakening, and the pharaoh’s subordinates were being threat- ened both by each other and by the marauding Habiru. 66 The note of urgent appeal is well marked in this letter to the pharaoh from Rib-Hadda, the pharaoh’s agent in Gubla (Byblos): Rib-Hadda says to his lord, king of all countries, Great King: May the Lady of Gubla grant power to the king, my lord. I fall at the feet of my lord, my Sun, seven times and seven times. May the king, my lord, know that Gubla, the loyal maidservant of the king, is safe and sound. The war, however, of the ‘Apiru forces against me is extremely severe, and so may the king, my lord, not neglect Sumur lest everyone be joined to the ‘Apiru forces.

(4) The Amarna letters no longer stand alone as evidence for the letter writing of that area and that period. One of the Amarna letters 67 was written by Ammištamru, king of Ugarit, c. 1400 BCE , and there are references to Ugarit in the letters of its neighbours. 68 The excavations at Ras Shamra (Ugarit) itself have now produced some 170 letters in Akkadian cuneiform and 85 in alphabetic cuneiform. 69 These letters were written in the fourteenth and thirteenth centuries BCE , and show that in the reign of Niqmaddu II Ugarit became tributary to the Hittite kingdom, and remained so until the destruc- tion of the city by the ‘sea peopl es’ early in the twelfth century. 70 The corre- spondence of the kings of Ugarit was frequently with the Hittite overlord or 65.

Also, not many of the letters could be described as appeals for help. Nevertheless, there ar e some examples, such as this letter from the prefect of Qadeš: To the king of Ugarit, my master, say: Thus (says) Padiya, prefect of Qadeš, [y]our ser[vant:] At the feet of my master, from afar, twice seven times I fall down.

May my master therefore prove his favour to his servant! And may my master not abandon his servant! So then, all that my master asks of his servant I will give my master. But, as to (my own) request, I hope my master has sent me...[the request is repeated in detail]. Now I have declared to my brothers: ‘It is a great king who has taken (me) (into his service) and he shows me favour’. So then, may my master not put me to shame before my brothers. What my master gives to his servant, may he give (truly)! (RS 20.16, ll. 1-19, 38-44) (5) The fact that Ugarit was so directly under Hittite in fl uence at this period makes the Hittite letters from Bogazköy of the thirteenth century BCE rele- vant, just as the Hittite treaties are relevant to the study of the Old Testament covenants. In fact, however, there is no letter that is actually an appeal for help from a vassal or of fi cial. Nevertheless, occasional features of the com- mon letter writing tradition will be illustrated from Hittite material. (6) and (7) The letters from the late Assyrian period found at Nimrud and Nineveh are second only in importance to the Amarna letters. Most of them are letters from royal of fi cials or vassals to the Assyrian kings Tiglath-pileser III, Shalmaneser V and Sargon II (Nimrud) and Esarhaddon and Aššurbani- pal (Nineveh). The letters are an invaluable source for the history of the reigns of the last two kings, 71 and they also include a number of appeals for help. The royal of fi cials had to contend with revolts by conquered peoples and inroads by foreign tribes, as well as maintain the routine administration of the provinces. They also frequently had to defend themselves against accusations and complaints. 72 The following letter from an of fi cial in Nippur illustrates some of the problems that had to be faced: The king knows that I am very sick. Had I not been sick, I would have gone to the king to inquire about his health. So I am sending herewith my brother Bel- usatu and ten well-born citizens of Nippur to inquire about the health of Your Majesty. The king well knows that people hate us everywhere on account of our allegiance to Assyria. We are not safe anywhere; wherever we might go we would be killed. People say: ‘Why did you submit to Assyria?’ We have now 71. See A.T. Olmstead, History of Assyria (New York: Charles Schribner’s Sons, 1923). 72.

We are still doing our duty for the king; the envoy and the of fi cials whom the king has sent here have seen all this and can tell the king about it. But the king must not abandon us to the others! We have no water and are in danger of dying for lack of water. The king your father wanted to give us the water rights for the Banitu-canal under this condition: ‘Dig an outlet from the Banitu-canal toward Nippur’. [The...], however, refused us the water. The king should now send an order to Ubaru, the commander of Babylon, to grant us an outlet from the Banitu-canal so that we can drink water with them from it and not have to desert the king on account of lack of water. They must not say everywhere: ‘These are the inhabitants of Nippur who submitted to Assyria—and when they became sick and tired of the lack of water they deserted’ (ABL 327, ll. 5-R22; Oppenheim, Letters , No. 121). These Assyrian letters were all written at the time when Assyria’s in fl uence on Israel and Judah was at its maximum. War and the threat of war dissemi- nated Assyrian culture in the west. 73 The kings of Israel and Judah paid trib- ute and imported Assyrian cults. 74 People from the Assyrian empire were settled in Samaria. 75 Of fi cials demanding surrender appeared at the gates of Jerusalem and harangued its citizens. 76 Hezekiah received letters, not only from the king of Assyria, 77 but also from the Chaldaean leader Merodach- baladan (Marduk-apla-idinna), who was in revolt against Assyria. 78 Thus we know that letters of the type found at Nimrud and Nineveh were received at Jerusalem. If any of the psalms were composed in this period—and there is a tradition of some literary activity in the reign of Hezekiah 79 —then it is quite possible that Assyrian of fi cial procedure and correspondence exercised an indirect, perhaps quite unconscious, in fl uence upon their content. Thus connections or parallels with the Old Testament have already been noticed in all these major collections of letters. In two cases, those of the Amarna letters and the Assyrian letters , there is a strong possibility that the traditions they represent were actually known to Israel. It is also important to notice that the collections themselves are evidence that a common letter writ- ing tradition existed in the ancient Near East and persisted for over a thousand years. The differences in style and c ontent are not more striking than the resemblances. For one thing, although the letters come from widely separated 73.

There are other examples of the early spread of Akkadian in fl uence in the countries bordering on the Mediterranean, 80 but none so remarkable as the fact that the H ittite and Egyptian kings should correspond in Akkadian 81 or that the pharaoh’s vassals and of fi cials in Syria and Palestine should report to him in Akkadian. Certain formulas and stylistic features recur. A king is always addressed in the third person (‘May my lord send me an answer to my letter’). In Old Babylonian, Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian letters it is common to open with a wish that the gods may protect the addressee; this feature appears also in letters from Ugarit, but it is rare in the Mari and Amarna letters. Correspon- dents from Mari onwards frequently give an assurance that all is well with them: this is particularly noticeable in letters from the pharaoh and the Assyr- ian king. The formula of homage used by of fi cials and vassals in the Amarna letters (‘Seven times and again seven times I prostrate myself at the feet of the king, my lord, and my sun’) reappears only slightly altered in letters to the king of Ugarit from his of fi cials (‘Twice seven times I prostrate myself before my lord, even from afar’). This continuity extends also to the motifs and arguments used in the letters, as the rest of this study will illustrate. It is clear from the evidence of a common epistolary tradition that it would be pedantic to look only for the in fl uence of this collection of letters or that on the Old Testament. What the letters show above all is that there was an accepted way of writing letters in the an cient Near East. Everywhere letters had the same functions, covered the same subjects, used the same arguments and adopted much the same style. Local variations there were bound to be, but these did not disturb the underlying continuity. What Kind of Parallel? We may now ask what kind of parallel may be expected between the letters and the biblical prayers. Certainly not any that would imply direct literary dependence. Letters are generally read only by those to whom they are addressed: they do not obtain the same currency as stories, poems, hymns for cultic use, inscriptions, law codes and treaties. Therefore it is extremely unlikely that any psalmist read any of the letters known to us. It is only the letter writing tradition in general which could have had any in fl uence on the psalmists, not any extant letter. 80. R.

Most of the latte r are poetical in form, keeping more or less strictly to a metrical pattern and employing parallelism. Although pas- sages of a rhythmical or strophic pattern have been noted in the Amarna letters, 82 this is not a general feature of the letters; they are prose documents. Some types of Akkadian psalm follow a fairly rigid order of motifs. 83 Both the Israelite psalms and secular letters have a much freer structure, but it is unlikely that the letters exercised any in fl uence over the psalms in this respect. The letters are full of names, fi gures and facts, as the psalms are not. The contrast is partly due to the fact that the psalms, even if composed for par- ticular occasions, were adapted for repeated use in an inde fi nite number of similar situations. 84 But it is also true that prayer to a god lacks the concrete- ness of an appeal to ‘a living and capricious master’. 85 The same contrast may be seen between hymns to a king and hymns to a deity both in Egypt and in Mesopotamia: the former have to ‘take cognisance of actual achievements, current fashions, and ideals’, whereas the religious hymns use ‘tradition- bound terms’. 86 On the other hand, the psalms describe conditions of danger with varied imagery, whereas the letters are more matter-of-fact. In the letters, as we have seen, vassals normally address the king in the third person; in the psalms direct address is more usual, and where the third person address occurs, it may re fl ect the usage of letters and courtly speech. 87 The analogy between the letters and the prayers lies much more in content than in style, though certain expressions, particularly expressions of depend- ence, are common to both. 88 Appeal to God and appeal to a king or other superior were essentially regarded as the same kind of activity. 89 Virtually the same arguments might be used, for God and king would be moved in much the same way. The parallel between the two activities was consciously recognised. Psalm 123 makes the comparison very plainly, as G.R. Castellino has noted: ‘The 82. See Appendix. 83. E.g. the šu-illa . 84.

Old Testament Prayers  25  1 sense of a more intimate attachment to God together with the attitude of obse- quiousness and devotion is expressed in Ps. 123.2 by means of a comparison, of frequent use in social and religious contexts drawn from the relation of master and slave’. 90 See, as the eyes of servants Look to the hand of their masters, And as the eyes of a servant-girl Look to the hand of her mistress, So our eyes look to Yahweh our God Until he has mercy on us (Ps. 123.2). One of the Hittite ‘Plague Prayers of Mursilis II’ is equally explicit: The bird takes refuge in (its) nest, and the nest saves its life. Again, if anything becomes too much for a servant, he appeals to his lord,. His lord hears him and takes pity on him. Whatever has become too much for him he sets right for him. Again: if the servant has incurred a guilt, but confesses his guilt to his lord, his lord may do with him whatever he pleases. But because (the servant) has confessed his guilt to his lord, his lord’s soul is paci fi ed, and his lord will not punish that servant. I have now confessed my father’s sin ( CTH 378; ANET , pp. 395-96; CoS , I.60 [Second Prayer, pp. 158-59]). Mursilis’ argument is that the Hittite storm god should act as a paci fi ed master would, now that the king has done his best to discover the cause of his people’s guilt and make restitution for it. Letters to the Gods Prayers sometimes even took the form of letters to the gods. 91 There are in Sumerian, in the early second millennium royal correspondence of Ur, Isin, Uruk and Larsa, a number of examples of letter prayers, which begin with the salutation ‘To my god speak, thus says NN your servant’. Then follow com- plaint, protests, prayers, and formal reinforcements of the appeal. Two letters conclude by referring to ‘(my) letter which I have deposited before you’; this re fl ects the practice of leaving petitions in the temple, at the feet of the cult statue, which is attested by excavati ons.

Eventu- ally they in turn gave way to prose prayers and then to poetic laments. 94 Nevertheless the practice was revived occasionally. At Mari Yasmah-addu addressed a poignant letter to the god Nergal after being deprived of a male heir with the death of his son, 95 and Zimri-lim accompanied the offering of a golden vase to the river god with a letter imploring the god’s protection. 96 The reports of Assyrian kings on victorious campaigns are letters to the gods in form, even if they were intended more for the ears of the citizens of Aššur. 97 And when Hezekiah received a threatening letter from Sennacherib, he thought it worthwhile to spread out the letter before Yahweh and invite him to read it as well as to hear it (2 Kgs 19.14, 16). We may take it that in the ancient Near East prayer and lette r writing were not regarded as funda- mentally dissimilar activities. Connection between Treaty and Letter The analogy between letters and prayers is related to that between treaty and covenant. At Bogazköy, Ugarit, Alalakh, Nimrud and Nineveh treaties have been found in the same archives as the letters we are consideri ng. They repre- sent different moments in the same relationship. In the Hittite treaties, the right of vassals to appeal for help by letter is recognised, as the following clause from the treaty between Mursilis II and Tuppi-Teššup of Amurru shows: If some matter oppresses you, anyone should press you hard, T uppi-Teššup, or someone revolts against you, and you write to the King of Hatti, then the King of Hatti will send infantry and chariotry to your aid ( CTH 62; HDT , No. 8, §9, p. 61; cf. ANET , p. 204, §11). Similarly, Hattusilis reminds Kadašman-Enlil II of Babylonia of the terms of a treaty previously made: If an enemy somehow arises against you, or some matter becomes troublesome for you, write to me so that I can come to your aid ( CTH 172; HDT , No. 23, §4, p. 139). 92.

Old Testament Prayers  27  1 In a letter to Niqmaddu II of Ugarit, proposing a treaty, the Hittite king, probably Šuppiluliumaš, encourages the vassal to appeal to him: And if all of the kings release whatever troops they have for an attack on your land, you, Niqmaddu, shall not fear them. Send your messenger to me imme- diately. Let him come! ( CTH 45; HDT , No. 19, §4, p. 126). The historical prologue to the treaty between Šuppiluliumaš and Tette of Nuhašši records an instance of such an appeal being made in the past: When (the king of Mitanni) oppressed (?) him, then Šarrupši sent his messen- ger to the King of Hatti, saying: ‘I am the subject of the King of Hatti. Save me!’ ( CTH 53; HDT , No. 7, §1, p. 55). This close connection between treaty and letter is also to be seen in Assyria. One of the most important discoveries at Nimrud has been that of the text of a treaty which Esarhaddon made with a number of his vassals in 672 BCE , requiring them to recognise the succession of Aššurbanipal to the throne of Assyria and that of his brother Šamaš-šumu-ukin to the throne of Babylo- nia. 98 It is clear, however, that this treaty is closely linked with the oath of loyalty that every one of the king’s own of fi cials had to take at the same time. Several letters from Nineveh refer to the taking of the oath in different locali- ties. 99 In another, the well-known exorcist Adad-šumu-usur 100 refers to criti- cism of Esarhaddon’s action in establishing the succession or, perhaps, in dividing it, but himself applauds it. 101 Two more are in fact excerpts from the oath as it was re-administered by Zakutu, the queen mother, the widow of Sennacherib, after the accession of Aššurbanipal. 102 Since the centralised territorial state was not the native and natural form of political organisation in Assyria, its smooth running depended entirely on the loyalty of the provincial governors and other of fi cials. 103 The oath of allegiance was therefore the cen- tral feature of their relationship with the king. Correspondents sometimes show that they are aware of this. For example, an unknown of fi cial, reporting to Aššurbanipal on the action he has taken against rebels, says: 98. D.J.

A priest, reporting that he has made a royal proclamation public, adds: I keep the king’s treaty (ABL 555 [SAA 13, No. 45], ll. 7-8). By the terms of the treaty of 672 BCE the vassals promised to protect Aššurbanipal, to fi ght and die for him, to give him honest advice, to carry out his commands, and not to plot or rise against him. 104 They were also expected to tell the king about any plot or expression of public opinion that came to their notice, a demand that is given prominent place in the oath imposed after Aššurbanipal’s accession. 105 Of fi cials are well aware that this is their duty: Is it not said in the treaty as follows : ‘Anyone who hears something (but) does not inform the king...’? (ABL 656 [ LAS , No. 133; SAA 10, No. 199], ll. 18- 21; Wiseman, Vassal Treaties , p. 8). 106 The king will also remind them of it, Aššurbanipal writes to Bel-ibni, gover- nor of the Sealand: 107 Just as somebody who loves the house of his master informs him about what- ever he sees or hears, exactly so have you informed me (ABL 288, ll. 9-R4; Oppenheim, Letters , No. 117).

I am (now) in trouble and petitioning the king, my lord (ABL 347 [SAA 16, No. 82], ll. 6-8)— could have been echoed by many of those who wrote to the king. Thus, both in Hittite diplomacy and in Assyrian statecraft, letters play an important part in the relationships established by treaty or oath of loyalty.

Old Testament Prayers  29  1 of Aššur in the eighteenth century BCE . 110 There is no mention of an oath of loyalty in the Amarna letters, but correspondents express the same sense of being under obligation to the pharaoh and of having the right to appeal to him. The same kind of relationship is implicit. Widengren says of the Akkadian prayers: ‘God and his worshippers were here the two parties of a covenant, of a pact, by which both had assumed mutual obligations. As long as man ful fi lled his obligations, he expected the god to ful fi l his.’ 111 While we may agree that worshippers expected their gods to behave as if they had entered into a treaty relationship with them, there is no evidence that they were believed to have done so on any given occasion. The gods were the guarantors of the royal treaties and of the oaths of alle- giance, but they were not parties to them. 112 When a people is searching for the explanation of some disaster in fl icted on them by the gods, they are quite likely to feel guilty of breaking the treaty, not with the gods, but with their human overlords. Thus the Arabs, after a series of unsuccessful rebellions against Assyria, asked themselves: ‘Why have such calamities befallen the land of Arabia?’ (and they answered themselves) ‘It is because we have not observed the great covenants with Aššur, and have sinned against the kindness of Aššurbanipal, the king whom Enlil loves’ (Annals of Aššurbanipal, col. ix, ll. 70-74; Streck, Assurbanipal , II, pp. 78-79; 113 ANET , p. 300). The Babylonian and Assyrian laws are decrees of the king: Marduk (according to the prologue) or Šamaš ( according to the relief on the stele and the epilogue) merely commissioned Hammurabi ‘to guide the people aright’. 114 The Akkadian prayers frequently complain that what the gods require is not known. 115 In contrast, Israelite prayers are set fi rmly in the context of Yahweh’s covenant with Israel, Solomon’s list of occasions for prayer (1 Kgs 8.22-53) envisages possible future breakdowns in Israel’s relationship with God, whose covenant is deposited in the ark in the temple being dedicated (v. 21) and who has a reputation for keeping the covenant with his servants and acting loyally towards them (v. 23). The prayers themselves refer explicitly to the covenant. In one of national psalms the people say: 110. Laessøe, People , pp. 147-48, 153. 111. Widengren, Psalms of Lamentation , p. 289. 112.

In Ps. 26.1-8, for example, the psalmist claims that his life will survive the most searching test of his loyalty to Yahweh: Judge me, Yahweh, for I have lived blamelessly, I have trusted in Yahweh without faltering. Examine me, Yahweh, and test me, Try my character and my heart. For the thought of your loyalty I keep before me, I have lived trusting in your faithfulness. I have not associated with worthless people, Nor do I join the company of schemers; I hate the gathering of evildoers, And do not sit down with the wicked. I will wash my hands in proof of innocence, And I will go round your altar, Yahweh, To make the sound of thanksgiving heard, And to relate all your wonderful deeds. Yahweh, I love your dwelling, your house, 1 The place where your glory abides. Similarly, in Ps. 17.1-5 the psalmist is certain that God has no fault to fi nd with him: although the text of the passage is uncertain, the general sense is clear. Ps. 7.4-6 ( EVV 3-5) has the form of a conditional curse upon oneself. 2 Yahweh, my God, if I have done this, If my hands are stained with injustice, If I have done a bad turn to a friend, 1.

Hans Schmidt 3 interpreted these and other psalms in which the innocence of the psalmist is either expressed or presupposed as ‘prayers of the accused’, that is, as forms for the ‘oath of purgation’ to be sworn in the situation described in 1 Kgs 8.31-32: 4 When a man sins against his neighbour and is required to swear an oath, and he comes and swears it before your altar in this house, hear it in heaven and act: judge your servants, condemning the wicked, bringing the consequences of his way upon him, but acquitting the innocent, giving him what his inno- cence deserves. There are, however, several considerations which make this unlikely. It may be granted that these psalms are couched in the language of the courts, and the passage quoted from Psalm 7 may well be modelled on a formal oath. But the declarations of innocence are too comprehensive and general to be the reply to speci fi c charges, 5 and the dangers to which the psalmist is exposed are not those attendant on wrongful conviction, but, as in other psalms, those which the malice of enemies may devise (see, e.g., Pss. 7.2-3 [ EVV 1-2]; 17.7-12). Other passages which set out a form of words for a situation like this (Num. 5.11-28; Deut. 21.1-9) suggest that the reference to the allegation would be quite speci fi c. 6 Even more important, perhaps, is the fact that prayers that include this motif are found outside the psalter also, assigned to situations where accusation of crimes or sins is not in question. When Hezekiah prays Yahweh, remember that I have been faithful and devoted to you, and have done what is good in your eyes (2 Kgs 20.3 = Isa. 38.3), it is not because he has been accused of any crime. Similarly, when Jeremiah pleads that he has not been given to merrymaking (Jer. 15.17) and that he has not deserted his post (Jer. 17.16), it is in the context of his own complaint 3.

The same motif can occur in one of the so- called communal laments (Ps. 44.18-23 [ EVV 17-22]); again a trial background is out of the question. Protestations of innocence are felt to be appropriate in more contexts than that of accusation in a formal trial. The innocence of the suppliants is advanced either as a reason why God should help them, 7 or as a ground of con fi dence that he will. 8 It is taken for granted that the prayer of the wicked will not be heard: Yahweh is far from the wicked, But he hears the prayer of the good (Prov. 15.29); If I countenance wickedness in my heart The Lord will not listen (Ps. 66.18). This conclusion is con fi rmed when the same feature is found in certain Akkadian psalms, and the context is clearly that of sickness, which the sup- pliant feels to be undeserved. In a hymn and lament addressed to Ištar, Aššur- nasirpal I claims to have feared the goddess, provided her sacri fi ces and restored images and temples. 9 Aššurbanipal says: ‘I have done good to God and men, to dead and living’. 10 Both say they are being treated ‘like one who does not reverence (the god’s) divinity’. 11 In Sumerian letter prayers the prot- estation of innocence appears along with the recalling of one’s past service and present rank as something which recommends the suppliant for future favours from the deity. 12 Ramesses II pleaded his innocence of any transgres- sion or neglect of Amun’s commands: I have not transgressed a plan that you have decreed!... Have I not built for you a great many monuments? Have I not fi lled your temple with my captives?... I have given to you all my possessions by testament, I have dedicated all lands together to you in order to endow your offerings.

It was natural that such protesta tion should have a prominent place in prayer, because it has an equally prominent place in the analogous secular situation. The letters illustrate this clearly. Corres pondents, who are generally provincial governors or royal of fi cials of some kind, are often at pains to remind the king of their loyalty. Rib-Hadda’s appeal to his record of loyalty to the previous pharaoh has already been quoted. But perhaps the most vehe- ment protests in the Amarna letters come from those whose loyalty was rightly suspect. Rib-Hadda, who probably did rule and defend Byblos in the pharaoh’s interests, was threatened through a great part of his career by ‘Abdi-aširta of Amurru and his son and successor Aziru. Now Aziru not only harassed his fellow vassals in Syria: he also made a treaty of alliance with the Hittite king Šuppiluliumaš. 14 Nevertheless he can protest complete loyalty: Now may the king, my lord, know that I am your servant for ever. I do not deviate from the orders of my lord. My lord, from the very fi rst I have wanted to enter the service of the king, my lord, but the magnates of Sumur do not permit me. Now, of dereliction of duty or the slightest thing against the king I am innocent. The king, my lord, knows who the real rebels are. And whatever the request of the king, my lord, I will grant it (EA 157, ll. 6-19). Similarly, Lab’ayu (of Shechem?) 15 is complained of in the letters of Šuwar- data of Hebron (EA 280), ‘Abdi-Heba of Jerusalem (EA 289) and Biridiya of Megiddo (EA 244; 245), and is probably to be identi fi ed with the ‘Apiru chief mentioned in EA 366, but he nevertheless protests his loyalty: The fact is that I am a loyal servant of the king! I am not a rebel and I am not delinquent in duty.

Protestations of Loyalty  35  1 This may have been only a show of loyalty for political reasons, 17 but it is interesting that even these men should feel the need to clear themselves in the pharaoh’s eyes. Assyrian vassals and of fi cials protest their loyalty in similar terms. Mero- dach-baladan, who was later to rebel against Assyria in the time of Sargon II and Sennacherib, earlier assisted Tiglath-pileser III to put down the rebe llion of Mukin-zeri. 18 He expressed his loyalty to the Assyrian king in terms that were routinely reproduced by Babylonian of fi cials of the period: I would go as substitute (in death) for my lord (ND 2389, l. 2; Nimrud Letters , pp. 10, 17-18). 19 A Nimrud letter, possibly on a question of land tenure, contains this vehe- ment passage: Indeed it is true. The king will certainly not believe me. I am a dog. The king my lord has wrought truth for the gods; would I send an untruthful message to the king my lord? (ND 2380 + 2396, ll. R4-11; Nimrud Letters , pp. 104-106). A Babylonian of fi cial rebuts an accusation that he has failed to reply to a communication from the king: I do indeed send my communications to the king my lord. Someone has not allowed the royal messenger to get throug h quickly to the king or has sent him away. As soon as the communication of the king came before me, I had an answer despatched to the king, as I wrote it. If the messenger does not pass it on, the king should not set it to the fault of (me) his servant (ND 2478, ll. 13-24; Nimrud Letters , pp. 11, 53-55).

He mentions his loyalty as a reason why the king should intervene: The king, my lord, knows that I am a poor man, keep the watch of the king, my lord, (and) am guilty of no negligence within the palace (ABL 421 [ LAS , No. 114; SAA 10, No. 173], ll. 17-R4; Laessøe, People , p. 97). Nabû-hamatua rebuts the charge of negligence: The king, my lord, should not say: ‘He is a negligent servant; he does not do his work’. I drive the servants of the king, my lord, day and night (ABL 1068 [SAA 5, No. 211], ll. R2-8). Na’id-Marduk, governor of the Sealand in the reign of Esarha ddon, in a letter to Zakutu, the queen mother, couples a request for troops with an expression of loyalty: My lord should know that my heart is completely devoted to my lord’s house (ABL 917, [SAA 18, No. 85] ll. R14-15). Another letter is thought to be from the Sealanders to Esarha ddon con fi rming the truth of what the governor claims: When we heard that the king was angry with our lord, we became afraid, say- ing: ‘Our lord has committed no sin in the king’s eyes’, inasmuch as he prays every morning and evening to Šamaš and Bel for the life of the king, his lord; his heart is completely devoted to the king, his lord, he is despised because of the king, his lord, and his house has been destroyed because he grasps the feet of the king his lord (ABL 958 [SAA 18, No. 88], ll. R3-10). Mannu-ki-Libbali declares that he is not implicated in a certain matter in terms very similar to the oath of purgation: I swear that I did not know (and) did not learn about this matter, that I am not implicated in it... If I am implicated in this matter, let the king, my lord, punish me (ABL 211 [SAA 16, No. 78], ll. 6-9, 15-17).

For example, there are complaints about Aziru in the letters of Akizzi of Qatna (EA 55, ll. 44-47) and Abi-Milku of Tyre (EA 151, ll. 59-68). The latter mentions an alliance Aziru has made with the ruler of Qadeš, and this accusation is taken up by the pharaoh in a letter to Aziru: Now the king has heard as follows. ‘You are at peace with the ruler of Qidša. The two of you take food and strong drink together’. And it is true. Why do you act so? Why are you at peace with a ruler with whom the king is fi ght- ing?... What happened to you among them that you are not on the side of the king, your lord? (EA 162, ll. 22-25, 28-29) No reply of Aziru to this particular charge has been preserved, but clearly his professions of loyalty must be related to the accusations which have been made against him. Sometimes the correspondent quotes the slander and rebuts it. Yamsûm protests his loyalty in a series of letters to Zimri-lim prompted by the accusa- tions Hâya-sûmû has made against him: My lord gave me instructions in these terms: ‘You are to go to the town of Ilân-surâ, and there you are to watch over what I will command you’. Accord- ing to the instructions of my lord, I have conscientiously ful fi lled my role and I have not made any mistakes nor left anything undone with respect to my lord’s business. If I have not con fi rmed what I have heard here and there and my eyes have seen, I have not written about it to my lord. It is possible that once or twice I have not con fi rmed a report, but in no case have I lied, for I could not lie to my lord. Now someone has sought out my lord and slandered me in these terms: ‘Yasîm-El has entrusted to Yamsûm Numaean slaves. He has disregarded the oath taken by Itûr-Mêr and my lord’. I swear that I have not seen anything in the hands of Yasîm-El or in the hands of soldiers, that I have not brought anything into the town of Ilân-surâ and that I have not hidden the matter from my lord: if not, who will rescue me one day or the other from the hands of my lord? (ARM XXVI.302, ll. 4-27 [ AEM , I/2, p. 56]). 24 Similarly, the letters in which Bel-ibni, a Babylonian of fi cial in the reigns of Sargon II and Sennacherib, 25 protests his innocence of the things he has been accused of must be seen against the background of speci fi c charges (ABL 283; 793; Oppenheim, Letters , No. 90). But in other instances the protesta- tion of loyalty is introduced simply as a reason why the king should act on the subject’s behalf: he deserves it. This is true of the occurrences of the motif in the letters of Rib-Hadda and Marduk-šumu-usur which have been cited. It is clear therefore that the motif is not con fi ned to situations in which 24.

Even where an oath of purgation occurs, as in a letter from Zeru-ibni to Sargon, it is an informal stylistic variation, not part of a judicial process: As to Marduk-eriba about whom the king, my lord, wrote to me, if I have put Marduk-eriba in irons, let them release his shackles and put them on my own feet! If not, let them pull the tongue out of the throat of the man who lied to the king, my lord! (ABL 154 [SAA 1, No. 205], ll. 4-11). The prominence of this feature in the letters, and its general character as a ground of appeal, make it likely that its occurrence in the biblical prayers is equally general in character. The evidence from the letters thus con fi rms the view that Schmidt’s thesis should be rejected. Confession of Faults Declarations of innocence and faithfulness are not, of course, always appro- priate. In Old Testament prayers, the worshippers are often only too well aware that they have sinned, and so they confess it. 26 The confession of sin becomes a dominant feature of post-exilic prayers, partly because the Deuter- onomistic theology would not allow that disaster could be due to any lack of faithfulness on God’s side, and partly because Jewish national hopes contin- ued to be disappointed. 27 The motif is also found in non-biblical prayers. Penitence is rare in Egyp- tian literature, though there are some late instances. 28 The early Sumerian prayers also lack explicit confession of sin, 29 but it is prominent in certain Akkadian psalms, particularly of the eršahunga type. 30 The self-confessed motive of these confessions is the appeasing of the gods, as an important inscription of Aššurbanipal makes clear: Their angry gods and wrathful goddesses I appeased with intercessory rites and laments to quieten the heart ( ARAB , II, §797). 31 26.

Protestations of Loyalty  39  1 Confession of guilt is not frequent in the letters: possibly correspondents thought that guilt could be hidden longe r from the king than from the god, or that the mercy of the god was more certain than that of the king. Excuses are relatively frequent. 32 But the occasional confession does occur. Even the truculent Lab’ayu admits to having entered Gezer, the city of Milk-ilu, though he seeks to show his action in a favourable light (EA 253, ll. 18-22; EA 254, ll. 20-29; Oppenheim, Letters , No. 68). 33 The writer of a letter to Esarhaddon (possibly Adad-šumu-usur) 34 confesses to an offence, but there is no indica- tion what it was: I committed a serious crime against the house of my lords. I (deserved) to be killed, not to be kept alive. Yet the king, my lord, had mercy on his dog (ABL 620 [SAA 16, No. 36], ll. 3-5). The Old Testament itself contains tw o or three instances of subjects con- fessing to the king that they have sinned against him (1 Sam. 25.28; 2 Sam. 19.19-20; 2 Kgs 18.14). These instances, biblical and non-biblical, are a suf fi cient reminder that the confession of sin is not a purely religious phe- nomenon, but has its secular analogue. ‘What is my Sin?’ Midway between the protestation of innocence and the confession of sin comes the hesitant query: What is my sin? This arises in a situation where the suppliant cannot explain a present calamity as the consequence of any known sin, but is prepared to admit that he may have sinned unwittingly through ignorance. Thus the psalmist says: Who can understand his accidental mistakes? Hold me innocent of secret faults (Ps. 19.13 [ EVV 12]). Job asks to know how he has offended: I will say to God, do not condemn me, Tell me what charge your are bringing against me (Job 10.2); How many evils and sins have I committed? Tell me my transgression and my sin (Job 13.23). 32. ABL 202; 276 (SAA 10, No. 371) (cf.

In the Sumerian letter prayers, to say ‘I do not know my guilt’ or ‘I do not know my sin, of my sin I have no knowledge’ is little more than a variation on the protestation of innocence, 35 but in the Akkadian psalms the suppliant genu- inely wants to know how he has gone wrong. He confesses sins known and unknown. 36 He asks: Who can understand the ways of God? 37 He wants to know how he has neglected the goddess, 38 what he has done. 39 The speaker in a well known late Sumerian psalm knows neither which god or goddess he has offended nor what his offence is: O god whom I know or do not know, my transgressions are many; great are my sins; O goddess whom I know or do not know, my transgressions are many; great are my sins. The transgression that I have committed, indeed I do not know; The sin that I have done, indeed I do not know. The forbidden thing that I have eaten, indeed I do not know; The prohibited place on which I have set foot, indeed I do not know ( SAHG 45, ll. 24-29 [p. 226]; HPD , p. 141; ANET , p. 391). The most remarkable product of this feeling of uncertainty is the (second) plague prayer of the Hittite king Muršiliš II ( CTH 378; ANET , pp. 394-96; CoS , I.60 [Second Prayer]). The king has been unable to recall any obvious sin for which the plague might have been sent. He has prayed to all the gods and asked them to establish the reason for the plague: Either let it be established by an omen, or let me see it in a dream, or let a prophet declare it (§2). 40 But these entreaties have had no effect so far on the course of the plague. Now two tablets have come to light which suggest that certain sins of his father may be responsible (§§3-5). For the sake of his people the king shoul- ders his father’s guilt and confesses it: It is only too true that man is sinful. My father sinned and transgressed against the word of the Hattian storm-god, my lord. But I have not sinned in any respect. It is only too true, however, that the father’s sin falls upon the son. So, my father’s sin has fallen on me (§9). 35. Hallo, ‘Individual Prayer’, p. 79. 36.

Protestations of Loyalty  41  1 The reason for confessing the sin of one’s forebears 41 is here clearly seen to be lack of awareness of any serious sins of one’s own, just as confession of the sins of one’s youth 42 and former iniquities 43 indicate that the worshipper is not conscious of present or recent si ns. Elsewhere, where it accompanies the confession of one’s own sin, it is included so as to cover all possible grounds for the god’s displeasure. 44 The same uncertainty about one’s offence is found in the letters. Many of them ask what the offence is that has been committed. A subject or vassal of the Hittite king Tudhaliyas IV (1 265–1230 BCE ), suspected of transferring his allegiance to the Assyrian king Shalmaneser I, asks what it is he is supposed to have done: In what respect have I now offended against my father? ( CTH 179; HDT , No. 25, §4, p. 151). 45 The Assyrian letters provide a number of examples. 46 Bel-ibni reports to Aššurbanipal a query of this kind on behalf of the Elamites: Send these words by a courier to the palace, ‘Now Elam has sent its messenger to the king of Assyria, with this message: “What is the sin which we have committed against you?” In regard to all this you are being negligent’ (ABL 792, ll. 8-12). Here is a very vigorous protest, probably from the time of Sargon: Concerning what the kind, my lord, w[rote to me], ‘I gave you [explicit orde]rs regarding the work on [...], but you do not obey me’—if I did not obey the king, my lord, whom else would I obey? Now the king, my lord, has (already) three or four times written to me in this manner; how can I live? My heart does not beat, my blood has dried up in my veins (ABL 455 [SAA 15, No. 30], ll. 4-14).

(ABL 543, ll. 9-15). Promise of Future Loyalty A further variation on this theme is the promise of future loyalty. In the bibli- cal psalms this is at it s simplest a vow to offer sacri fi ce (Pss. 54.8 [ EVV 6]; 66.14-16 [ EVV 13-15]; cf. Gen. 28.20-22; Judg. 11.30-31), or the praise which Yahweh prefers to sacri fi ce (Ps. 51.17-18 [ EVV 15-16]; 69.31-32 [ EVV 30-31]). Similar promises are made in non-biblical prayers. In a Sumerian letter prayer the suppliant says that he will ‘dwell in your gates and sing your praises...and proclaim your exaltation’. 47 Akkadian psalms frequently close with a promise to sing the praise of the god or goddess when the prayer is answered. 48 Sometimes, however, the biblical psalmist promises loyalty of a more comprehensive kind. Thus in Psalm 101 the suppliant (probably the king at his enthronement 49 ) says: I will keep prudently to a blameless way: When will you come to me? I will behave irreproachably Within my house, I will not set before my eyes Any wicked thing. I hate any crooked dealing, It shall not involve me. I will put away corrupt motives from me: I will not tolerate a wicked person. Him who slanders his neighbour in secret I will get rid of, Him who has a proud look and an arrogant spirit I will not endure. My eyes will be upon the loyal in the land: They shall be in my household. He who conducts himself blamelessly Shall serve me. The man who practises deceit Shall not remain in my house, 47.

Day by day I will root out All the wrongdoers of the land, And so cut off from Yahweh’s city All who practise evil (Ps. 101.2-8). 50 The clearest parallels to a promise of loyalty of this order are to be found in the letters rather than in the non-biblical psalms. In a letter from Nimrud, Nabû-etir reports that the governor of a certain district had promised tribute as a result of punitive action: I myself sent a message for the king my lord to the governor. In this manner he replied to me, saying: ‘The people will cultivate as much as is at their dis- posal. I will not hold one back. I will send everyone out and will deliver to the king my lord’ (ND 2649, ll. 11-23; Nimrud Letters , pp. 206-207). Bel-ibni writes as follows to Aššurbanipal upon his appointment as governor of the Sealand: Now the king my lord [sees] the faithfuln ess of his servant with the house of his lord, how indeed (it is), when I keep the watch of the king my lord—a ser- vant, a friend, and a sharp blade am I [in] the hand of the king my lord (ABL 521, ll. 18-22). 51 The foregoing has shown that pleas in the biblical psalms based on wor- shippers’ conduct, whether they declare themselves innocent or penitent or mysti fi ed, have close parallels in the letters which passed between subjects and their kings, as well as in non-biblical prayers. Since there is no reason to believe that there was any literary dependence of the biblical prayers on the non-biblical, the presence of these pleas in the psalms is most simply explained as due to the recognition of the analogy between the secular and religious situations. 50. It is not certain that the imperfect tenses in this psalm should be translated as futures: if they are taken as past or present tenses, then the passage quoted becomes a protestation of loyalty rather than a promise. 51.

For my life is ending in grief, And my years in groaning, My strength is failing because of my distress 3 And my bones are wasting away.

We may instance the well-known lament of Aššurbanipal: Why have sickness, sorrow, (wasting) and ruin come upon me? Discord in the country and fi erce quarrelling in my household never leave me; Insurrection and slander are continually plotted against me. Deep af fl iction and bodily pain have bowed down my fi gure; I spend the day groaning and complaining ( SAHG B 17, ll. 2-6). What is the purpose of these descriptions or narrations of distress? In the case of the Akkadian prayers, the answer to this question is complicated by the presence of magical ideas. Although magic is not always presupposed as the cause of the distress, and even some of the šu-illa prayers, which were those most closely associated wi th magical rituals, lack any reference to magic, 12 nevertheless it is very common for sickness to be regarded as the work of magicians and demons. 13 Thus it is likely that one reason for cataloguing the sufferings in detail is that this is required for a successful exorcism: the af fl iction must be named before it can be removed. 14 But the suppliant has at least been allowed to fall into the hands of evil powers by the god, 15 and so 9.

The long descriptions of sufferings are therefore to be understood wholly as elements in the appeal to Yahweh. 20 ‘This description is in itself aimed at getting the prayer heard: it is intended to rouse the compassion of Yahweh and make him help’. 21 Comparison with passages in the royal correspondence helps to indicate what their function is. Many letters describe the situation of the writer in the starkest terms. 22 The trouble may well be enemy action: the complaints in the Amarna letters about the activities of ‘Abdi-aširta and his sons, and of Lab’ayu and the ‘Apiru are well known and have already been mentioned. Rib-Hadda of Gubla (Byblos) writes as follows about the way his position is menaced by Abdi-aširta of Amurru: May the king, my lord, know that the war of Abdi-aširta against me is severe, and he has taken all my cities. Now only two towns remain to me, and even these he strives to take.

An of fi cial in Syria, Uhati, reports that There is continual hostility (ND 2437, l. 40; Nimrud Letters , pp. 169-71; SAA 1, no. 176). Nabû-balassu-iqbi, a Babylonian of fi cial, quotes to Aššurbanipal an earlier letter he had sent about the opposition he was encountering in Akkad: ‘There are people here, my enemies, who are putting obstacles in my way— without the king knowing about it—and who say terrible things about me to the king so that the king should destroy me’. Your Majesty should know that the same two men who took the gold jewellery from around my neck still go on planning to destroy me and to ruin me, and what terrible words about me have they made reach the ears of Your Majesty! (ABL 716, ll. 25-R4; Oppenheim, Letters , No. 128). 26 Like some of the psalmists, 27 a correspondent quotes the boasts of those who are guilty of lawless behaviour: When the king, my lord, had not yet stationed me in my post, they [the priests of Ea] used to commit thefts and cover them up. Left on their own, they can cover anything up without any effort, thus causing great whispering in the temple. Now they are all of one accord, saying, ‘Let’s do it this way’. I speak to them but they don’t listen (SAA 13, No. 138, ll. R2-11). Hostile words and actions are by no means the only trouble complained of. Mušezib-ilu explains why he has not been able to report to the king in person: I have been taken ill on the way; I am very sick; and the scribe apparently con fi rms this: He cannot go. He cannot come into the presence of the king (ND 2387, ll. 5-7; Nimrud Letters , pp. 246-48). Even those who did reach the king were not guaranteed a sympathetic recep- tion: During my audience with my lord, I was not able to tell my lord about my misfortunes. ‘Get out!’ I was told. So I went, and on my honour I was not able to tell my lord anything (ARM XXVI.145, ll. 3-8 [ AEM , I/1, pp. 309-10]). Nergal-šarrani, a priestly functionary, writes to tell Esarhaddon that he is sick and appeals to him to send a physician or a conjurer: 26. Cf.

Let the word come forth from the mouth of the king that he should act and get me through this sickness of mine (ABL 203 [SAA 13, No. 73], ll. 7-R12). 28 During the civil war between Aššurbanipal and his brother Šamaš-šumu-ukin in 652 BCE , the citizens of Ur complained that their loyalty to Assyria was putting them in danger of starvation: We and Sin-tabni-usur (the governor of Ur) have kept the watch of the king my lord. In hunger [we] have eaten the fl esh of our sons and daughters (ABL 1274, ll. 7-11). 29 Others complain of shortage of water (ABL 327), shortage of oil (ARM XXVI.29, ll.

Writers frequently complain of bei ng slandered or falsely accused. Thus Rib-Hadda of Byblos writes to the pharaoh: As to his having said before the king, ‘There is a pestilence in the lands’, the king, my lord, should not listen to the words of other men. There is no pesti- lence in the lands. It has been over for a long time (EA 362, ll. 45-53; Oppenheim, Letters , No. 75). An Assyrian of fi cial, Aššur-da’’inanni, had apparently been accused of dis- loyalty by another of fi cial: I have approached the king my lord to say, there is no one who is not obedient. If I am guilty of an offence before the king my lord, let the king my lord kill me. But why should these people kill me?... Now that man has indeed been quick to send a message of calumny against me to the king my lord, when he said...that he sent me a message. We do our duty to the king my lord. Let that man and me argue it out eye to eye with the king (ND 2711, ll. 4-8, 38-44; Nimrud Letters , pp. 297-300).

He plundered my patrimony. All that my father had acquired under the king’s aegis he plundered and carried off. (ABL 152 [SAA 13, No. 154], ll. 8-R2). 31 Others complain of being out of favour, such as Adad-šumu-usur (ABL 2 [ LAS , No. 121; SAA 10, No. 228]; 657 [ LAS , No. 120; SAA 10, No. 224]) and Nabû-tabni-usur: (While) all my associates are happy, I am dying of a broken heart. I am treated as if I did not keep the watch of the king, my lord (ABL 525 [ LAS , No. 264; SAA 10, No. 334], ll. R10-12). Or the trouble may be that the writer’s appeals or the king’s orders are not getting through. This was particularly true, perhaps, when Sargon was away in Babylonia, and Sennacherib was left in charge at Kalhu (Nimrud). Nabü- usalla, an of fi cial in the extreme north, passes on the complaint of a deputa- tion to Sargon: ‘We spoke with the governor and the royal bodyguard, but they did not agree to bring us to the Palace’ (ABL 206 [SAA 5, No. 104], ll. R7-11). 32 Asqudum, 33 who took rather seriously the duty of informing on other of fi cials, reports to Zimri-lim that a divi ner is not receiving maintenance: When I arrived at Qattunân, he stated his grievance before me. The man has not received his maintenance. My lord has fi xed the amount of his maintenance but Ilu- ŝ u-nasir [the governor] has not given it to him (ARM XXVI.141, ll. 8-13 [ AEM , I/1, p. 305]).

He is very upset about the cost of redeeming the fi eld. At present the diviner has calmed down (ARM XXVI.147, ll. 18-21 [ AEM , I/1, p. 312]); or because of the desperateness of the complainants’ situation: The daughter of my lord, Kirû, who lives here, has said to me: ‘Write and tell my lord that Hâya-sûmû no longer cares for me’. Now she has said to me, ‘Because my lord no longer cares for me, either he will kill me, or else I will throw myself off the roof. That is what Kirû has said to me in no uncertain terms (ARM XXVI.304, ll. 37-46 [ AEM , I/2, p. 60]). 34 Yamsûm intercedes for Ibni-Addu, fearing for his safety at the hands of Hâya-sûmû: This man has been tied up inside his palace and taken to the town of Elali. Moreover, he has been imprisoned in a yoke and his house has been looted... At the moment I do not know whether this man is dead or alive. My lord should hold an enquiry about this man!... He is one of your loyal servants! You must not assume that he has committed an offence when it’s a matter of life or death for him! Send a trustworthy man, a mounted man, who will be impartial, so that the man may live (ARM XXVI.312, ll. R7-9, 25-32 [ AEM , I/2, p. 71]). Plainly the main purpose of these passages in the letters is to inform the king just how serious the situation is. If only the king knows what is wrong, he will act. When someone like Rib-Hadda of Byblos sends repeated letters describing his situation, he is obviously not sending routine reports, but reminding the king of a situation he would prefer to forget, trying to move him by his importunity to take pity on him. Possibly none of the biblical psalmists thought he was telling Yahweh something he did not already know. But he would be haunted by the fear that Yahweh might have forgotten him: Will the Lord reject us for ever? Will he never show us favour again? Has his loyalty utterly ceased? Is his promise at an end for all time? Has God forgotten to show mercy? Has he shut up his compassion in anger? (Ps. 77.8-10 [ EVV 7-9]). 35 This fear would arise partly out of the fact that the distress continued, but also partly from experience of being forgotten by human authorities.

Yahweh is reminded that his worshipper’s enemies are his enemies: For see, your enemies are in turbulent mood, Those who hate you are asserting themselves. They plot cunningly against your people, And they scheme against your intimate friends. They say, ‘Come, let us wipe them out, so that they are a nation no longer, So that the name Israel may be remembered no more’. For they have become of one mind, 2 And they are making a covenant against you (Ps. 83.3-6 [ EVV 2-5]; cf. 5.11 [ EVV 10]; 74.23). Yahweh is also reminded that when Israel is defeated, his property is being de fi led: 1. Gunkel and Begrich, Einleitung , §§4.8, 10; 6.17; Clifford, Psalms 1–72 , pp. 47-48: ‘The psalmist urgently asks God: Will you, my divine patron, allow me, your loyal client, to suffer serious injury or death? The triumph of the enemies makes the patron God look ineffectual and uncaring. The client appeals to the patron’s sense of noblesse oblige rather than to the client’s own virtue.

Appeal to King’s or God’s Own Interests  53  1 O God, the nations have invaded your inheritance: They have profaned your holy temple, They have reduced Jerusalem to ruins (Ps. 79.1; cf. 74.2, 7). This motif is exceedingly common in prayers outside the Psalter, particularly from the post-exilic period. 3 Again, when the man at the point of death reminds Yahweh that when he is dead he will not be able to worship him, besides the man’s own sense of loss there may be a suggestion that it is in Yahweh’s own interests to keep him alive, since only in this world is he able to testify to Yahweh’s faithfulness: For Sheol cannot thank you, Death does not praise you, They that go down into the Pit cannot hope for your faithfulness. He who is alive—he can thank you As I do today. A father to his children Can make known your faithfulness (Isa. 38.18-19). 4 Yahweh’s kingdom is not regarded as beyond the reach of harm; it is not thought that disaster can make no inroads into it. It is bound up with the fortunes of a people, and the individual people alive in it, even though it does not owe its existence to their consent and is not at their disposal. Yahweh’s rule will be discredited if he leaves his servants defenceless. 5 The same themes are found in non-Israelite prayers. Ramesses II, in his prayer before the battle of Qadeš, demands of Amun: ‘Has a father (ever) ignored his son?’ 6 In the Egyptian prayer to Thoth found in Pap.Anastasi V.9.2-10.2, the suppliant prays: ‘Come to me and care for me. I am a servant of your house.’ 7 The suppliant’s ‘introduction of himself’ in the šu-illa 8 may well have this aim of establishing his claim on the god’s mercy. The quotation 3.

The argument is used even more freely in letters. The of fi cial is himself a tangible part of the king’s realm and ought therefore to be protected. Padiya, the prefect of Qadeš, writes thus to the king of Ugarit: Constantly to the nobles, my brothers, I have declared: ‘The king of Ugarit is my master’. May my master therefore show favour to his servant! And may my master not abandon his servant! (RS 20.16, ll. 8-14; Ugaritica , V, p. 119).

Appeal to King’s or God’s Own Interests  55  1 An of fi cial at Calah, appealing for res ources, asks the crown prince who will look after the latter’s interests if he does not: If only the crown prince, my lord, would turn his attention to me, I’d perform the works of the crown prince and deliver them to the crown prince, my lord. If I did not do it, who would do and deliver (them) to the crown prince? Would the accountant (and) the drunks do it? (ABL 885 [SAA 16, No. 34], ll. 22-R 2). Correspondents remind the king that his property is in jeopardy. Rib-Hadda says of Gubla (Byblos): There is much property of the king in it, possessions of our ancestors in the past. If the king neglects the city, of all the cities of Canaan not one will be his (EA 137, ll. 74-76 [Oppenheim, Letters , No. 76]; cf. 286, ll. 35-38, 57-60). There are two vivid illustrations of this motif in the Mari letters. Yasmah- Addu charges Šamši-Addu with neglecting his own property in forcible terms: Does the palace of Šubat-Šamaš really belong to another king? Or does the palace of Tuttul belong to another king? Both these palaces belong to Addâ (ARM I.118, ll. R21-23; DEPM , I, pp. 165-68 [No. 48]). Halismu, king of Hansura, uses the same appeal very plainly in a letter to Zimri-lim, after he has reported that certain cities have been abandoned: These cities are yours! Do not be inactive and do what has to be done to liberate these cities! (ARM II.62, ll. 6-8; DEPM , I, pp. 484-86 [No. 307]) 13 The Old Testament yields one clear example of the secular use of this motif: Abigail persuaded David not to carry out his intention to kill Nabal, on the ground that when his fortunes are secu re, as they surely will be, he will not want the enjoyment of them spoilt by the memory of a needless act of revenge (1 Sam. 25.30-31). We may also note that a king occasiona lly admits the force of the appeal. In a letter to Kadašman-Enlil of Babylonia, Hattušiliš says of his vassal Bantešinna: Bantešinna is my subject. If he has cursed my brother, has he not cursed me too? ( CTH 172; HDT , No. 23, §11, p. 142) Once again, it is clear from these parallels that when the psalmists appealed to God to consider his own interests, they were using an argument familiar in secular life. 13.

ARM XIII.143 ( DEPM , I, pp. 475-78 [No. 303])."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" 1 6 Q UOTATION OF E NEMY ’ S R EPROACHES A fourth common motif is the quotation of the enemy’s reproaches. 1 If only the king (or Yahweh) can hear what the foreigners are saying about him, he will be stung into activity. 2 Examples from the psalms are numerous: Remember this, that the enemy is taunting you, Yahweh, A barbarous people is treating your name with contempt (Ps. 74.18). 3 Even the insults which the enemies hurl at the psalmist are quoted, since they are indirectly disparagements of the God he worships: I am a worm, not a man, Taunted by my fellows, despised by the people. All who see me mock me, They sneer and wag their heads— ‘He depends on 4 Yahweh; let him save him, Let him deliver him, if he is pleased with him (Ps. 22.7-9 [ EVV 6-8]). 5 The argument from the enemy’s reproaches is made particularly clear in Psalm 69. The psalmist has endured these insults for Yahweh’s sake, as a good servant should, but he fears that ot her worshippers of Yahweh will be involved in his shame: Do not let your followers be shamed through me, O Lord, Yahweh of hosts; Do not let your worshippers be humiliated through me, O God of Israel. 1.

I am a stranger to my brothers, An alien to my mother’s children. Zeal for your house has consumed me, And the taunts of those who taunted you have fallen on me. I bowed down 6 my soul with fasting, And that brought taunts upon me; I wore sackcloth, And became an object of scorn to them. Those who sit in the gate mock me, And I am the subject of the songs of drunkards (Ps. 69.7-13 [ EVV 6-12]). There are no clear examples of this motif in non-Israelite prayers. This may be taken as an indication that the Israelite prayers are closer to the actual situation of the suppliant, and not so thoroughly adapted for cultic use as the non-Israelite psalms. In the letters, the reproaches of the enemy are frequently quoted, but some caution is necessary before deciding the reason. First, quotation is a feature of the letters: what others say is given as direct quotation, and earlier corre- spondence is sometimes quoted in full. Then we have already seen that of fi - cials were duty bound to report any seditious words or acts: they were the ‘eyes and ears of the king’. The reproaches would be reported in any case, not only to stir the king to activity. Nevertheless, it is clear enough that the enemy’s malicious words are in many instances quoted to buttress the appeal for help. It is for this reason that Rib-Hadda quotes both the discontented grumblings of the people of Byblos: Look, the people of Gubla keep writing, ‘Where are the days when the king, your lord, used to write to you? Where are the troops of the days when they were sent to you?’ (EA 138, ll. 122-26) and the avowed intentions of the enemy: They seek to capture Gubla, and they say, ‘If we capture Gubla, we will be strong’ (EA 362, ll. 23-27; Oppenheim, Letters , No. 75). In a letter to Aššurbanipal’s son Sin-šarru-iškun, Dadî, the chief treasurer, quotes the seditious words of Arbela in order that the king may con fi rm his authority: I have now written to them as follows, ‘Why do you not fear the king?’ Ten men run around with them, draped with weapons, saying, ‘Whoever comes against us we will cut down with (our) bows’. My lord, should c[all] his servants [to account] (ABL 727 [SAA 13, No. 20], ll. R4-14). 6.

The chiefs have spoken insolently, saying, ‘We have not heard in regard to [the governor]’. Let the king inquire of the second of fi cer. He was present when the report was given to the commander-in-chief (ABL 205 [SAA 5, No. 169], ll. 14, R1-7). Another of fi cial asks Aššurbanipal why such words are allowed: Why do Bel-šumu-iškun, the son of Sillaia, and Ša-Nabu-šu of Uruk speak, saying, ‘In this house he is not faithful. B ecause you do not recognise Elam... Why have you established the base of the wall here? As long as you live, the land of Assyria will never love you’ (ABL 1204, ll. R2-10). This use of hostile words is especially clear when what is quoted is what the enemies may say if the king does not act. Thus Rib-Hadda writes to Ameno- phis III: Let it not be said in the days of the commissioners, ‘The ‘Apiru have taken the entire country!’ Not so shall it be said in the days of the commissioners, or you will not be able to take it back (EA 83, ll. 16-20), and ‘Abdi-Heba of Jerusalem writes to Akhenaten: Let no man say in the presence of the king, my lord, that the land of the king, my lord, is lost, and all the regents are lost (EA 288, ll. 54-56; ANET , p. 489). 7 Similarly, the governor of Nippur writes to the Assyrian king: The king should now send an order to Ubaru, the commander of Babylon, to grant us an outlet from Banitu-canal so that we can drink water with them from it and not have to desert the king on account of lack of water. They must not say everywhere: ‘These are the inhabitants of Nippur who submitted to Assyria—and when they became sick and tired of the lack of water they deserted’ (ABL 327, ll. R11-22; Oppenheim, Letters , No. 121). 7. Moran ( Amarna Letters , p. 331) reads EA 288, ll. 54-56 as a denial that such losses have been reported: ‘They have not reported to the king that the lands of my king, my lord, are lost and all the mayors are lost’."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" 1 7 D IRECT R EPROACHES Both in the prayers and in the letters, the suppliants feel free to turn to direct reproaches. If the duties of the subject towards the king or those of the worshipper towards God were felt to be clearly de fi ned, a corresponding understanding of the king’s duties towards his subjects and of the duties Yahweh recognised as his had been built up. It was therefore possible for a subject to charge a king with unworthy conduct, or laxness in the protection of his subjects. Similarly, it was possible to reproach Yahweh for allowing what was unjust to happen, 1 for neglecting what he had created, 2 for forget- ting his oath and his covenant 3 and for not coming to his servants’ aid, as he had shown himself willing and able to do in the past, 4 or as his quality of ­ esed implied that he would. 5 In the psalms these reproaches fi nd expression chie fl y in ‘the short reproachful question’. 6 These questions begin either ‘Why?’ ( hm @ f l f , ( a w % d @ m a ), implying of course that the suffering seems to be undeserved, 7 or ‘How long?’ ( hn F ) f -d( a , yt a m f -d( a , hm f -d( a ), implying that the distress is long drawn out. 8 Examples are numerous.

How long will you hide your face from me? How long shall I take counsel with myself And have sorrow in my heart all day long? How long shall my enemy triumph over me? (Ps. 13.2-3 [ EVV 1-2]). 10 These complaints can also take the form of statements about what Yahweh has done or permitted or failed to do, particularly in the communal laments: But now you have rejected us and humiliated us, And you do not set out with our armies; You have made us retreat before the foe, And our enemies have taken their plunder; You have given us up like sheep for food, And you have scattered us among the nations. You have sold your people cheaply, And you have not bene fi ted from the price. You have made us the object of our neighbours’ scorn, The butt and the laughingstock of those around us; You have made us a byword among the nations, Cause for the peoples to shake their heads (Ps. 44.10-15 [ EVV 9-14]). 11 These accusations against God belong to the earlier history of the lament: in post-exilic prayers they are replaced almost entirely by confessions of sin and af fi rmations of God’s justice. 12 Reproaches of this kind are also f ound in non-Israelite prayers. Before the battle of Qadeš Ramesses II asks: ‘What is wrong with you, my father Amun?’ 13 ‘How long?’ questions occur more frequently than in Israelite prayers, 14 in both the communal laments and the individual laments. In the former, Enlil, the god held responsible for the destruction of the cities in Sumer, is asked by Damgalnunna, the patron goddess, how long it will be before her city can be rebuilt: 10. Cf.

The complaint ‘Like one who does not fear god and goddess am I treated’ 17 occurs in wisdom literature as well. 18 The complaints here are stylised, how- ever, and show little evidence of having grown out of particular situations. An exception is the letter prayer Yasmah-addu addressed to the god Nergal when the death of his son deprived him of a male heir: Why have you taken away my son?

And how is it you have appointed Enlil-îpûs as major-domo? (ARM XXVI.5, ll. 20-22 [ AEM , I/1, pp. 83-89]). Albright speaks of the ‘truculent tone’ of Lab’ayu in an early letter (EA 252) to the Egyptian court; 20 but other correspondents are in their way equally forthright.

Similarly, the inhabitants of Tunip complain that the pharaoh has failed to send Aki-Teššup with a chariot force: Why does the king, our lord, call him back from the journey? (EA 59, ll. 19-20). In the Assyrian letters the most frequent complaint is that letters have not been answered or that a plea has been ignored. Bel-ibni has sent captives and horses to Aššurbanipal but has received no reply (ABL 794). Aššur-resuwa writes to Sargon II: Why is my lord silent (while) I wag my tail and run about like a dog?

Similarly, the ruler of Arzabia sends this message to Sargon for Sennacherib to pass on: The ruler of Ukku must be kept away from me; why do you keep silent while he is trying to destroy me? (SAA 1, No. 29). It may be added that in the Old Testament itself there are some examples of such reproaches of the king, and not only from prophets. Shimei even dares to curse the king (2 Sam. 16.5-8). Jonathan protests against his father’s treatment of David: He took his life in his hand when he killed the Philistine and Yahweh brought about a great victory for the whole of Israel. You witnessed it and you were glad. Now why will you wrong an innocent man and kill David for no reason?... Why should be die? What has he done? (1 Sam. 19.5; 20.32) The woman of Tekoa turns her petition into a criticism of David’s treatment of Absalom: Why have you thought to do the same sort of thing against God’s people? In giving this judgment the king pronounces himself a guilty man for not recall- ing the person he has banished (2 Sam. 14.13). Joab can with equal force condemn David’s unrestrained grief for Absalom: Today you have disappointed all your servants, who have today saved your life and the lives of your sons and daughter, your wives and concubines, by loving those who hate you and hating those who love you. You have shown today that your leaders and servants mean nothing to you. I can see today that if Absalom were alive and we were all dead, you would be well pleased (2 Sam. 19.6-7 [ EVV 5-6]). It is therefore overwhelmingly probable that the freedom the psalmists use in reproaching Yahweh re fl ects the freedom subjects used in making com- plaints to the king. The theme is too stylised and conventional in the non- Israelite psalms for cultic inspiration to be a suf fi cient explanation. 23. Cf.

General Terms We will fi rst consider some quite general terms used to express this sense of dependence. Trust The psalmist frequently expresses his trust in God: Preserve my life, for I am loyal; My God, rescue your servant who trusts in you (Ps. 86.2). 2 The same motif occurs in non-biblical prayers, such as this prayer to Enlil: My lord, I trust you, I praise you, my ears are inclined to you ( SAHG B 41, ll. 17-18; HPD , pp. 274-75; Before the Muses , III.38[b], p. 558), 3 and a prayer to Amun after the downfall of the heretical Amarna dynasty: Amun, I love you and I trust in you (Erman, Ancient Egyptians , p. 310; 4 Barucq, L’expression , p. 327). 5 1.

Expressions of Dependence  65  1 Such expressions of trust or con fi dence provide a further motivation for the deity to hear and answer the prayer. 6 Letter writers similarly express their trust in the king. The king of Hani- galbat writes to the Hittite king: I have put my trust in Your Majesty, my father ( CTH 179; HDT , No. 25, §3). Raši-il writes thus to Esarhaddon: I am the one who blesses the king, my lord . I trust in the king, my lord. I pray to Marduk and Zarpanitu for the life, happiness, health, and longevity of the king, my lord. I must not become estranged from the king, my lord. Marduk- zeru-ibni is slandering me because he trusted Urdu-Nabû and Nadinu. I, on the other hand, trust in the king, my lord (ABL 498 [SAA 13, No. 174], ll. R1-11). And a priest writes: He has silver at his disposal and trusts in his gold; but I trust in the king, my lord (ABL 555 [SAA 13, No. 45], ll. R7-10). Waiting for God or King Trust means, in practical terms, waiting for god or king to act. This is what is meant by the psalmists’ declarations that they are waiting for God. 7 Let integrity and uprightness defend me, For I am waiting for you (Ps. 25.21); Guide me with your truth and teach me, For you are the God who will save me, I wait for you all the day long (Ps. 25.5); I wait for Yahweh, my soul waits, I expect his word (Ps. 130.5; cf. 27.14; 40 2 [ EVV 1]). This becomes even clearer against the background of the letters. Šarru- emuranni awaits orders from Sargon: I am waiting for the king my lord’s me ssenger; what are the king my lord’s orders? (ABL 311 [SAA 5, No. 199], ll. R5-10). Urdu-Nabû, who is sick and cannot come to the king, writes to Esarhaddon: The king’s servants are saying to me: ‘Appeal to the king, go, get yourself cured’. I keep asking myself: ‘How is the king, my lord, disposed? Neverthe- less, I will appeal to [or, wait for] him’. Now let me not be lost to my lord. Let him appoint one exorcist and one physician to attend me. (ABL 1133 [SAA 13, No. 66], ll. R6-12). 6. Mowinckel, Psalms , I, p. 206. 7. It is possible that in some cases (e.g. Ps. 38.16 [ EVV 15]) this should be understood as waiting for an oracle (Gunkel and Begrich, Einleitung , §6.4 [p. 178, ET p. 125])."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"66 ‘I have written to the king, my lord’ 1 It is in response to an expectation of this kind that Aššurbanipal writes to Bel-ibni: You have informed [me], I shall act to the best of my ability (ABL 402, ll. R5-7). Eyes Fixed on God or King The psalmist may say that his eyes are fi xed on Yahweh: My eyes are continually upon Yahweh For he will draw my feet out of the net (Ps. 25.15). 8 The same motif is found, understandably enough, in Egyptian prayers to the sun, for example: You cross the sky (and) all faces are (turned) towards you, Unceasingly, (even) at night (N. de G. Davies, Rock Tombs , IV, No. 4; Barucq, L’expression , p. 27). In the letters, subjects have their eyes fi xed expectantly on the king. Thus in a letter to Esarhaddon in which the correspondent confesses an offence, he says: My heart, my arms, (and) my feet are placed beneath the chariot of the king, my lord. My eyes are constantly fi xed upon the king, my lord, and the crown prince, my lord, constantly encourages me (ABL 620 [SAA 16, No. 36], ll. 7-11). 9 This expression is also used with refe rence to the king in the Old Testament: Upon you, my lord the king, are the eyes of all Israel, that you should tell them who is to sit upon the throne of my lord the king after him (1 Kgs 1.20). It is especially interesting for two reasons. First, keeping one’s eyes turned to the king or suzerain is the attitude required by treaty obligation. Thus Muršiliš, in his treaty with Tuppi-Teššup of Amurru, says: You shall not turn your eyes to another. Your ancestors paid tribute to Egypt, [but] you [shall not pay it...] ( CTH 62; HDT , No. 8, §5, p. 60). Second, the analogy between the relationship with a human superior and that with God is made explicit in a psalm: 8. Cf. Pss. 104.27; 141.8; 145.15; Tob. 3.12. 9. Cf.

Protection What do subjects and worshippers depend on king and god for? In the fi rst place for protection. A number of expressions may be classi fi ed under this heading. Protection in General A letter shows that the protection of kings and gods can be thought of together: I always used to take refuge with Marduk and Zarpanitu. I always used to take refuge with the king, my lord (ABL 1034 [SAA 13, No. 182], ll. R4-6). Tammaritu, the deposed king of Elam, says this in his reply to a kindly letter from Aššurbanipal: By the heart of the god and the protecting genius of the king he lives (Olmstead, History of Assyria , p. 463; ABL 943, ll. 5-6). Zimri-lim implored the river god for protection: May my lord neglect nothing which concerns my protection! May my lord not turn his face elsewhere! May my lord not show his ki ndness to anyone else but me! (ARM XXVI.191, ll. 12-15 [ AEM , I/1, p. 413]) The Hittite king Hattušiliš says of Ištar: I will take my refuge in God continually ( CTH 85; Goetze, Hethitische Texte , I, p. 47). 10 Esarhaddon received oracular assura nces of protection from Ištar: I will protect my king. I will bring enemies in neckstocks and vassals with tribute before his feet (SAA 9, Oracle 2.5, ll. 23-25). 11 10. A.

Davies, Inscriptions , p. 235). The promise of protection is a vital part of treaty obligation. The treaty between Muršiliš II and Sunaššura of Kissuwadni contains the following clauses: As His Majesty protects his own person and land, he must likewise protect the land and person of Sunaššura... As Sunaššura protects his own land and person, he must likewise protect the person and land of His Majesty ( CTH 41; HDT , No. 2, §§11, 12, pp. 19-20). 15 The citizens of Babylon remind Aššurbanipal that among their chartered rights as a free city is the royal guarantee of protection: The kings our lords, from the time they ascended the throne, set their faces to protect our chartered rights and for our welfare, The kings our lords have ordained that those who occupy our fi elds, whether a woman of Elam, of Tabal, or of the Ahlamu, should have protection, as they have declared: ‘The gods have given you open ears and an open heart. For all the lands is Babylon the bond of the lands; whoever enters there, his protection is guaranteed’. ‘One breaking through the house of Babylon’ is the name given to the charter. ‘A dog which enters shall not be killed’ (ABL 878, ll. 2-11; Olmstead, History of Assyria , p. 432). Another letter consists of a proclamation of Aššurbanipal to the Babylonians as ‘men under my protection’, that is, c itizens of an imperial free city (ABL 926, l. 1; Olmstead, History of Assyria , p. 476). That mention of dependence on the king’s protection is no mere conven- tion is well illustrated by a letter from Rib-Hadda: Why does the king, my lord, write to me, ‘Guard! Be on your guard!’ With what shall I guard? With my enemies, or with my peasantry? Who would guard me? If the king guards his servant, then I will survive. But if the king does not guard me, who will guard me? (EA 112, ll. 7-18). 12. Ramesses II, Poem on the Battle of Qadeš, l. 171; B.G.

Expressions of Dependence  69  1 Physical Defences It is common to describe a god’s protection in terms of physical defences. For example, in the Psalms: Yahweh is my rock and my stronghold and my deliverer, My God, my rocky cliff where I seek refuge, My shield, my horn of rescue, my secure retreat (Ps. 18.3 [ EVV 2]). 16 In Egypt the gods assure the pharaoh that they are his shield: My hand is a shield for your breast, averting evil from you (Medinet Habu 26.3-4; Edgerton and Wilson, Historical Records , p. 18 17 ) says Amun-Re to Ramesses III. 18 In Assyria Ištar gives Esarhaddon a similar assurance: O Esarhaddon, I will be your good shield in Arbela (SAA 9, Oracle 1.6, l. 18, p. 8). Akkadian proper names contain references to gods as bulwark, mountain, wall defence. 19 Similar metaphors are used of the king’s protection, particularly in Egypt. Abi-milku of Tyre writes as follows to Akhenaten: You are the Sun who comes forth over me, and a brazen wall set up for him, and because of the powerful arm I am at rest. I am con fi dent (EA 147, ll. 52- 56; Oppenheim, Letters , No. 67; ANET , p. 484). Similarly, Ibašši-ilu writes to Esarhaddon: The king is the bulwark (lit. ‘city wall’) of the weak one (ABL 166 [SAA 16, No. 30], l. R 1). 20 The metaphor of the wall has a long history in Egypt. A hymn to Sesotris III (Twelfth Dynasty; nineteenth century BCE ) describes him as ‘a rampart of walls of copper’; 21 Amenophis II (Eighteeenth Dynasty; fi fteenth century BCE ) 16. Cf. Pss. 27.5; 61.3-4 ( EVV 2-3); 62.3 ( EVV 2); 91.1-2; Jer. 20.11; Barucq, L’expression , p. 346. 17. W.F. Edgerton and J.A.

Thus Raši-il to Esarhaddon: The king, my lord, has reared me from my childhood until the present day, and ten times has the king, my lord, taken my hand and saved my life from my enemies (ABL 499 [SAA 10, No. 166], ll. 6-12); and Adad-šumu-usur to Esarhaddon: Nobody has reminded (the king) about Urad-Gula, the servant of the king, my lord. He is dying of a broken heart, and is shattered from falling out of the hands of the king, my lord. The king, my lord, has revived many people (ABL 657 [ LAS , No. 120; SAA 10, No. 224], ll. 16-R8; cf. Oppenheim, Letters , No. 95). 26 The inhabitants of Tunip deplore the lack of the pharaoh’s protection in the same terms: And now Tunip, your city, weeps, and its tears fl ow, and there is no grasping of our hand (EA 59, ll. 39-42). The protection of the gods is spoken of in the same way, both in non- Israelite sources and in the Psalms. The Egyptian god Min ‘gives his hand to him whom he loves’, 27 and an Egyptian prays ‘Give me your hand’. 28 An Akkadian hymn says of Ninurta 22. ARE , II, §792; B.G.

The expression used for assuming the kingship, ‘seizing the hands of Bel’, though it primarily indicated an act of fealty towards the god on the part of the king, 29 may also have implied that the king was putting himself under the god’s protection. This imagery is of course very familiar in the Old Testament. Yahweh delivers his people from Egypt ‘with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm’ (Deut. 26.8, etc.). From the Psalms we may quote the following from a com- munal lament: For they did not occupy the land by means of their sword, Nor did their arm give them victory: But your right hand and your arm, And the light of your face, because you showed them favour (Ps. 44.4 [ EVV 3]). 30 Shadow Another very striking metaphor for protection is the shadow, whether this is thought of as the shadow of wings, the shadow of a rock or mountain or the shade of a tree. The shadow of various gods is referred to in Assyrian inscrip- tions, for example, in Sargon’s Letter to Aššur: Šamaš, the great judge of the gods, who opened the way and spread his protection over my army ( ARAB , II, §176). 31 Yahweh’s shadow similarly is referred to in the Psalms: He who lives in the hiding place of Elyon And lodges under the shadow of Shaddai... He will cover you with his pinions And under his wings you will seek refuge (Ps. 91.1, 4). 32 The king’s shadow is mentioned more than once in the Old Testament: in Jotham’s fable, with reference to Abimelech’s attempt to make himself king of Israel: 29.

In Egypt itself, Sesostris III is comp ared both to ‘a cool place that lets every man sleep to daybreak’ and to ‘a shade in the inundation season, a cool place in summer’. 33 In Assyria, the king’s shadow is referred to both in inscriptions and in letters. Building inscriptions frequently record that Sar- gon or a later king ‘stretched his protecting shadow’ over such and such a territory or city. 34 An oracle of Ištar says: Who is the man who had no friends, the man who is despised? Let him take courage under the shadow of Esarhaddon (Langdon, Tammuz , p. 139; 35 Olmstead, History of Assyria , p. 358). In a letter found at Nimrud Sargon sends this message of encouragement to Sennacherib, who at that time had military duties on Assyria’s northern frontier: Now eat your food and drink your water in the shadow of the king my lord. Let your heart be glad. There is indeed no reason for anxiety on account of the Muskaean (ND 2759, ll. R39-42; Nimrud Letters , pp. 188-92; cf. ND 2784; SAA 1, No. 1).

(ND 2636, ll. R9-10; Nimrud Letters , pp. 61-63). Warrior It is natural that the subject should depend on the king for protection, since one of the king’s chief functions was to lead his people in war. ‘We will have a king over us’, say the Israelites to Samuel, ‘to judge us, to rule us, to go out at our head, and to fi ght our battles—so that we may be like all the other nations’ (1 Sam. 8.19-20). The king’s prowess in war was one of the chief themes of praise. 37 Yahweh is conceived as a warrior along very similar lines. 38 There is something of the hero or the champion about both. Compare, for example, this description by Esarhaddon of how he donned his armour before battle in Egypt— I raged like a lion, I put on (my) coat of mail, (my) helmet, emblem of battle, I put on my head. I grasped in my hand the strong bow and the [mighty] arrow which Aššur, king of the gods had put into my hands ( ARAB , II, §561)— with the similar description of Yahweh: Yahweh saw it, and it was wrong in his eyes, That there should be no justice; He saw that there was no man to put things right, And was appalled that there was no one to intervene. And so his own arm won victory for him, And his own integrity, that upheld him. 36. Adad-šumu-usur is fond of this image of shadow or shelter: cf.

Again, Psalm 46 celebrates Yahweh’s victory in terms very similar to those used in a hymn to Ramesses II. In the psalm, Yahweh brings wars to an end throughout the earth; He snaps the bow and cuts the spear in two; Chariots he burns in the fi re (Ps. 46.10 [ EVV 9]), while in fear of the pharaoh the Asiatics ‘break their bows and are given over to the fi re’. 39 As Yahweh’s power in this respect is said to extend ‘throughout the earth’ (hardly ‘throughout the land’ merely), so Ramesses is said to r each ‘the ends of the earth when seeking for battle’. Provision Protection is not the only thing for which people depend on God or king. They are also regarded as providing for their subjects or worshippers, provid- ing either the necessities of life themselv es or the conditions that ensure their supply. This is intimately connected with protection of course: it is the king’s protection that makes normal life possible: Didn’t the king say to me as follows, ‘Go, plant, fi ll the cellars with harvest and eat under my protection!’?

But similar language is used of the king. 44 Even in the Old Testament he is described as ‘the breath of our nostrils’ (Lam. 4.20), and this is frequently paralleled in Egyptian sources. It is said of Amenophis II in the fi fteenth century, ‘There are no foreign lands which can build a boundary against him for they live by means of his breath’; 45 and Libyan captives are still saying to Ramesses III in the twelfth century ‘Give to us the breath, that we may breathe it, and the life, that which is in your hands!’ 46 Akkadian sources also provide more general language about the king as lifegiver.

May it please the king, my lord, to give life to his servant (EA 198, ll. 17-25). 50 Royal inscriptions often express as much pride at having successfully provided for the people as they do in military victory. For example, in the Instruction of King Amenemhet I (twentieth century BCE ) the king claimed: I was the one who made barley, the beloved of the grain-god. The Nile hon- oured me on every broad expanse. No one hungered in my years; no one thirsted therein ( ANET , p. 419a).

Ramesses II is proud of the fact that Food is in his hands and af fl uence is beneath his feet, and provisions rest beneath his sandals (B.G. Davies, Inscriptions , pp. 122-23). Much later, an inscription of Ramesses III says that ‘supplies and provisions are abundant in his reign’ (Medinet Habu 46.9; Edgerton and Wilson, His- torical Records , p. 51). In Assyria, a cylinder commemorating the founding of Sargon’s new capital at Dur-Šarrukin describes him as The sagacious king, full of kindness (words of grace), who gave his t hought to the restoration of (towns) that had fallen to ruins, to bringing fi elds under cultivation, to the planting of orchards , who set his mind on raising crops on steep (high) slopes whereon no vegetation had fl ourished since the days of old; whose heart moved him to set our plants in waste areas where a plough was unknown in (all the days) of former kings, to make (these regions) ring with (the sound of) jubilation, to cause the sp rings of the plain to gush forth, to 49.

Sun This favourite epithet for the king probably belongs under the heading of the king as provider. It is especially frequent in the Amarna letters, where the king is both like the sun and ‘is’ the sun. For example, Rib-Hadda says to Akhenaten Moreover, is it pleasing in the sight of the king, who is like Baal and Šamaš in the sky, that the sons of ‘Abdi-Asirta do as they please? (EA 108, ll. 8-13). 52 The Assyrian king Esarhaddon similarly is compared to the sun god (among other gods): The king, the lord of the world, is the very image of Šamaš (ABL 5 [ LAS , No. 143; SAA 10, No. 196], R 4-5). 53 Abi-milku of Tyre, on the other hand, calls Akhenaten the sun or the sun god, the same word šamaš being used for both in Akkadian: My lord is the Sun who comes forth over all lands day by day, according to the way of being of the Sun, his gracious father... You are the Sun who comes forth over me, and a brazen wall set up for him... I indeed said to the Sun, the father of the king, my lord, ‘When shall I see the face of the king, my lord?’ (EA 147, ll. 5-8, 52-54, 57-60; Oppenheim, Letters , No. 67; ANET , p. 484). 54 51. Cf.

Ham- murabi is the ‘sun of Babylon’ (CH, Prologue, col. v.4); 56 the early Assyrian kings describe themselves as the ‘Sun of all peoples’; 57 in an oracle Aššur promises Esarhaddon that ‘from sunrise to sunset there is no king equal to him; he shines as brilliantly as the sun’; 58 the Hittite kings regularly take the title, ‘the Sun, the Great King’; 59 the inscriptions of Ramesses III refer to him as the sun. 60 The analogy in prayer is obvious in Egyptian and Mesopotamian reli- gion: prayers are regularly addresse d to the sun (god) Re or Šamaš. 61 There is only one possible instance of Yahweh being described as ‘sun’ in the Old Testament (Ps. 84.12 [ EVV 11]), but here the parallel ‘shield’ suggests that the correct translation may be ‘battlement’. 62 Although the Israelite king is described as the ‘lamp of Israel’ (2 Sam. 21.17), the title ‘sun’ is never used of him in the Old Testament. Both the Egyptian pharaoh (EA 266, ll. 13-15) and Yahweh (Ps. 36.10 [ EVV 9]) are, however, said to give light. Shepherd This is another title that expresses the idea of provider. Passages in the Old Testament in which this title is used of Yahweh are very familiar. 63 It is also used of the Israelite king: 55.

All the of fi ces of state were in the gift of the ruling monarch. Continuance in of fi ce as well as promotion depended on the royal favour. 70 Mannu-ki-Libbali is at pains to assure Esarhaddon that he is not dependent on the patronage of anyone else: What have I been able to give to my lord in exchange for this favour that the king, my lord, has shown his servant? Would the patronage of the palace scribe have had such an in fl uence over me that I would still be obliged to him? (ABL 211 [SAA 16, No. 78], ll. 8-11). Rib-Hadda expresses the wish to be near the king: Moreover, it would please me if I were with you and so at peace (EA 116, ll. 48-50). The reason is that the king provided for a circle of favoured subjects at court: the Old Testament provides many instances of this ‘open hospitality’. 71 Yahweh is thought to hold court in much the same way. The following pas- sage from a psalm must be read in the light of this system of patronage: How precious is your loyalty, O God! Men can take refuge under the shadow of your wings, They can take their fi ll from the abundance of your house, You let them drink from your river of delights. With you is the fountain of life, And by your light we shall see light (Ps. 36.8-10 [ EVV 7-9]). 72 Those who enjoy a standing at court are to be congratulated, as Solomon’s courtiers are by the Queen of Sheba: Happy are your men, 73 happy these servants of yours who always stand before you and hear your wisdom!

Ineni, a courtier of the sixteenth-century king Thutmose II, is in no doubt of his good fortune: I was a favourite of the king in his every place; greater was that which he did for me than those who preceded (me). I attained the old age of the revered, I possessed the favour of his majesty every day. I was supplied from the table of the king with bread of oblations for the king, beer likewise, meat, fat meat, vegetables, various fruits, honey, cakes, wine, oil. My n ecessities we re appor- tioned in health and life, as his majesty himself said, for love of me ( ARE , II, §117). One of Amenophis III’s architects, however, attributes his advancement in the king’s service to the favour of the god Amun: My lord made me controller of your monuments, Because he knew my vigilance. I was a vigorous controller of your monuments, One who did right as you wished. For I knew you are content with right, You advance him who does it on earth. I did it and you advanced me ( CoS , I.27 [p. 44]; ANET , pp. 367-68). The man who cannot gain access to court feels left outside in the dark. Thus the governor of Barhalza, a province west of Nineveh, to Esarhaddon: Like sunshine, all the countries are illumi nated by your light. But I have been left in darkness; no one brings me before the king (ABL 916 [SAA 16, No. 29], ll. 14-15). Seeing (the Face) An expression much used in this conn ection is ‘seeing (the face of) god or king’. 74 Amarna correspondents express the desire to see the face of the pharaoh. Thus Abi-milku of Tyre: I indeed said to the Sun, the father of the king, my lord, ‘When shall I see the face of the king, my lord?’ (EA 147, ll. 57-60; ANET , p. 484; Oppenheim, Letters , No. 67), 74.

Thus Akhenaten to Aziru: Come yourself, or send your son, and y ou will see the king at whose sight all lands live (EA 162, ll. 48-50); Aššurbanipal to Nabû-ušabši Come now, in joy behold the face of the king your lord, and give him the counsel which is good for the king your lord (ABL 517, ll.

I want to encourage him and appoint him over you (ABL 293, ll. R1-7). A letter from Nabû-šumur-iddina in Calah makes it clear that the image implies a personal audience: The face of the king, my lord, has been seen by very many people. Let an order be given to the palace overseers: when the elders pass by beneath the terrace, let them allow me to see the face of the king, my lord, and may the king look at me. Let them constantly send me word on the health of the king, my lord. Upon whom are my eyes fi xed? In that I have written, let them allow me to enter before the king and speak to him (ABL 377 [SAA 13, No. 80], ll. 11-R9). For the king to allow subjects to see him is in itself an act of patronage. Ramesses II compares his daily custom of hearing petitions with the rising of the sun each day—both are welcome: He shines in the horizon every day in order to hear all his petitions (which are addressed) to him. He says to him (every) time that he rises: What do you want? I will do it for you (B.G. Davies, Inscriptions , pp. 128-29). For subjects, then, seeing the king is an opportunity to put a case in person, remove misunderstandings, and obviate the weariness of writing letters and getting no answer: [Once] or twice I have written to the king my lord, and I long [for] the sight of the king my lord, that I may see the face of the king my lord.

Sadly, being summoned to court was no guarantee of getting an audience: Unlike a servant of the king, on the day when I came here at the written order of the king, my lord, I did not even get an audience with the king, my lord. And I perish at my work, like a dog; I have not even entered the presence of the king, my lord. Am I not your servant? O king, my lord, let me behold that beautiful face of yours. Why must I die for want of food? Like a dog I bound about and roam around. I have no house, no maid, no servant. If this is the way the king, my lord, regards me, I am fi nished.

Much has been written about the meaning of ‘seeing (the face of) God’ in the Old Testament, 77 and the parallel with ‘seeing the face of the king’ in the Old Testament 78 as well as in Akkadian letters has more than once been pointed out. In one interesting letter to Sargon, Aha-lurši welcomes the opportunity a visit to Babylon will give him to ‘see’ both the god Bel and the king: May Nabu and Marduk bless the king, my lord! that the king, my lord, invited me to Babylon, that I am going to see Bel and present a votive gift to Bel..., that I am going to see the face of the king, my lord, and kiss the ground before the king, my lord (ABL 842 [SAA 1, No. 132], ll.

Thus, when the psalmist says O God, you are my God: I will seek you earnestly; My soul thirsts for you, my fl esh faints for you (In a parched, thirsty, waterless land 81 ) To see you as I saw you in the sanctuary, To see your strength and your glory (Ps. 63.2-3 [ EVV 1-2]), 82 the possibility of a visual experience is by no means excluded, 83 but it is clear that something like a reversal of fortune is thought to be involved as well. In Egypt the desire to see God is expressed almost exclusively with reference to solar deities. 84 It is obviously a desire literally to see the sun, but for its life- giving qualities as much as for its light and heat. In Akkadian prayers the expression ‘to see the face of the god’ no doubt means that the worshipper saw an image of the deity, 85 but even here the sight of the image symbolises the opportunity to plead with the deity in person. The case for thinking that ‘seeing (the face of) God’ has this idiomatic sense is strengthened when it is remembered how many idioms there are which include the face. A good Old Testament illustration is Gen. 32.21 ( EVV 20): For he said, I will placate him ( wyn F p f hr F p ; @ k a ) j , lit. ‘I will cover [or wipe, smooth] 86 his face’) with the present which goes ahead of me; after that I will see his face ( wyn F p f h) f r : ) e ); perhaps he will receive me ( yn A p f )# & % f y I , lit. ‘lift up my face’). 80.

R11: ‘[May I not] perish. [May I] see the f ace of the king [my lord] among the living’. 83. Widengren, Psalms of Lamentation , pp. 251-57, argues that ‘the formula “see the face of God” and “seek the face of God” ought to be considered traces of allusions to images of the Israelite God’ (p. 256). 84.

Expressions of Dependence  85  1 In addition, Yahweh is said to ‘hide his face’ 87 and his face is said to ‘shine’ upon his people; 88 they may ‘smooth’ Yahweh’s face 89 or rejoice in the light of his face. 90 The same expressions may be used in secular situations. 91 In every case it is clear that the literal sens e is entirely subordinate to the idio- matic; what matters is Yahweh’s anger and the appeasing of it, or his good pleasure and the enjoyment of it. An idiom of a similar kind which occurs both in the psalms and in the letters is ‘lifting up the head’ of the suppliant. 92 Gifts of Land The king’s patronage sometimes took the form of gifts of la nd. When Samuel was telling the Israelites what kind of king they must expect, he said: He will take the best of your fi elds, your vineyards and your oliveyards and give them to his servants (1 Sam. 8.14). 93 It is likely that when it is said that the Egyptian crown prince led Thutmose IV ‘to pleasant ways’ ( ARE , II, §836), acquisition of territory is meant. The following lines from Psalm 16 may therefore have been composed with this form of patronage in mind: Yahweh is my share of inheritance and my cup; You wield my lot when I cast it; The measuring lines have fallen in pleasant places for me; Indeed, my property is excellent (Ps. 16.5-6). In Loco Parentis The king’s patronage would have been especially important to any whose hopes of an inheritance from their parents had been disappointed.

(ARM X.90 [ DEPM , III, pp. 374-76 (No. 1185)]) Zakir, the head shepherd of Nabu in Babylon, writes to Aššurbanipal as follows: He has deprived me of my father’s house, and he plays tricks on me constantly. May the king my lord not forsake me (ABL 416, ll. R4-7 [ CAD , N 1, p. 155b]). Sidqum-Lanasi, an in fl uential citizen of Carchemish, asks Zimri-lim to treat their new king, Yatar-Ami, as a father would his son: (Yatar-Ami says): ‘My father Aplahanda is not dead; he is still living, since Zimri-lim acts as my father’. Yatar-Ami is a son for you, full of loyalty: guide him! And since his father is dead and he himself lacks experience, you should speak to him with no reserve (ARM XXVI.537, ll. R2-9 [ AEM , I/2, p. 530]). Rib-Hadda, writing to Amanappa, an of fi cial at court, asks him to say to the pharaoh: You are father and lord to me, and to you I have turned (EA 73, ll. 35-38). Adad-šumu-usur similarly speaks of Aššurbanipal as acting like a father: The king, my lord, has treated his servants as a father treats his sons; ever since mankind has existed, who is the king who has done such a favour to his servants, and what friend has returned a bene fi t in such a manner to his friend? (ABL 358 [ LAS , No. 122], ll. 22-29). 94 Sometimes the subject realises that he has received far more from the king than he could ever have hoped for from his parents. It has already been remarked that neither the rulers of Egypt under the Eighteenth Dynasty nor the Assyrian kings relied upon hereditary of fi ce holders, but created a new aristocracy of their own followers. Thus an of fi cial might say that at the start of his career he was ‘without (in fl uential) kindred’ or that he ‘was humble of family, one of small account in his town’. 95 The king therefore was ‘he who has built me, created me, caused me to exist’ and caused him to take his place ‘among men’. 96 Abdi-Heba of Jerusalem says explicitly that he owes his position to the king and not to his parents: As far as I am concerned, neither my father not my mother put me in this place, but the strong arm of the king brought me into my father’s house (EA 286, ll. 9-13; ANET , p. 487). 97 94.

Similarly, Aššurbanipal says to the goddess Mullissu: I am your servant, Aššurbanipal, whom your hands created, whom without father and mother you brought up and raised to greatness ( CoS I.144, ll. 16-17 [p. 475]). Tokens of Approval If it is impossible for the suppliant to attend the court, he may ask for some tokens of the king’s approval. Padiya, the prefect of Qadeš, in a letter to the king of Ugarit, gives a long list of gifts which he has asked for and which the king has promised to send him, and then he adds: I have told my brothers: ‘It is a great king who has taken (me into his service) and he gives me proof of his favour’. May my master then not shame me in front of my brothers. What my master is giving to his servant, may he give (indeed)! (RS 20.16, ll. 38-44; Ugaritica , V, p. 119). Bel-ibni asks to receive insignia of of fi ce from Sennacherib, Sargon II’s son and successor: Would that [your Majesty consider me again] one of his servants, that an of fi cial acknowledgment of my status as a servant of your Majesty come forth so that I will not be treated with contempt any more by my fellow Babylonians and will not have to [bow] my head in shame.

For you, Yahweh, have helped me and comforted me (Ps. 86.17); Our signs we do not see, There is no longer a prophet, There is no one among us who knows how long (Ps. 74.9). There is a well known suggestion 100 that the transition from prayer to thanksgiving in certain psalms 101 is to be explained, not by assuming an inward conviction on the worshipper’s part, but by predicating the interven- tion of some objective sign from God, such as an oracle, an omen or a dream. The desire that prayers should be answered in this way is clearly expressed in Zimri-lim’s letter prayer to the river god— Now, I have just had brought to my lord a golden vase. Earlier, I had informed my lord and my lord had made me see a sign. May my lord make me obtain unreservedly the sign which he made me see! (ARM XXVI.191, ll. 5-9 [ AEM , I/1, p. 413])— and in the (second) Plague Prayer of Muršiliš II: If indeed it is for these reasons which I have mentioned that people are dying,—as soon as I set them right, let those that are still able to give sacri fi - cial loaves and libations die no longer! If, on the other hand, people are dying for some other reason, either let me see it in a dream, or let it be found out by an oracle, or let a prophet declare it, or let all the priests fi nd out by incubation whatever I suggest to them ( CTH 378; ANET , p. 396; CoS I.60 [Second Prayer, p. 159]). 102 The story of Saul and the witch of Endor shows that the same expectations were entertained in Israel: Saul consulted Yahweh, but Yahweh did not answer him, by dreams, by the sacred lot, or by prophets (1 Sam. 28.6). The narrative in which Hezekiah’s prayer is embedded includes the promise of recovery through the prophet (Isa. 38.4-6 = 2 Kgs 20.4-7), and this is supported by a miraculous sign Hezekiah asks for (2 Kgs 20.8-11; Isa. 38.7- 8, 22). This strongly suggests that some tangible assurance was expected after a prayer had been offered, in the same way as the letter writer expected a reply and a token of support and con fi dence. 100.

Expressions of Dependence  89  1 The archives contain an occasional royal letter giving the desired promise of support. Aššurbanipal gives the following assurance to Sin-tabni-usur, the governor of Ur: Because I knew your loyalty, I have in turn conferred favour on you... The favours which I shall requite you shall be to children’s children (ABL 290, ll. R4-6, 20-21). We may compare with this the many oracles the Assyrian kings received from their gods. These might take one of two forms: either they would con- sist of favourable omens observed in the liver of a sheep, 103 or they might be put in the form of encouraging messages, such as the oracles from Ištar sent to Esarhaddon: [Esarh]addon, king of the lands, fear [not]!... I am the Great Lady, I am Ištar of Arbela, who cast your enemies before your feet... Could you not rely on the previous utterance which I spoke to you? Now you can rely on the later one too... You shall eat safe food and drink safe water, and you shall be safe in your palace. Your son and your grandson shall rule as kings on the lap of Ninurta (SAA 9, Oracles 1.1, ll. 4-5, 11-15, 1.10, ll. 6-12, 21-29, pp. 4, 10; cf. ANET , pp. 449-50). 104 An inscription of Esarhaddon recounts how astronomical phenomena, ‘mes- sages from ecstatic prophets’, and good omens in dreams and oracles com- bined to make him con fi dent. 105 There is also a prayer of Aššurbanipal to Nabu which contains the answers of the god as well as the petitions of the king ( SAHG B 39; Before the Muses , IV.4[f], pp. 712-13). Oracular elements in the psalms 106 and the encouraging oracles of the prophets (Haggai and Zechariah provide good examples) ful fi l the same function. Discom fi ture of Enemies Tokens of approval would have added value if they were public enough to discom fi t the suppliant’s enemies. The city Irqata writes to Akhenaten: May the king, our lord, heed the words of his loyal servants.

I will fl ay your enemies and give them to you (SAA 9, Oracle 1.1, ll. 8-10, 18-19, p. 4). 109 Counsel Letters are written, not only to elicit encouragement and tokens of approval, but also speci fi c directions in particular circumstances. Hence correspondents frequently say how much they value the king’s counsel. Aziru, the son of ‘Abdi-Asirta, writes as follows to Tutu, a high of fi cial of Akhenaten: Hatip has come and brought the gracious and sweet words of the king, my lord, and I am quite overjoyed. My land and my brothers, the servants of the king, my lord, and the servants of Tutu, my lord, are overjoyed when the breath of the king, my lord, comes. I do not deviate from the orders of my lord, my god, my Sun, and from the orders of Tutu, my lord (EA 164, ll. 4-17). The king has been endowed with wisdom by the gods: Bel and Nabu have given vast insight to the king, my lord (ABL 211 [SAA 16, No. 78], ll. 13-14). The king’s decisions, and even those of the queen mother, 110 are fi nal: The word of the king, my lord, is just as fi nal as that of the gods (ABL 1221 [SAA 13, No. 46], ll. 11-12). They defer to it against their better judgment: a letter from Nimrud contains the following: If the king my lord should say: ‘Let th em take and eat for themselves’, then let them take and eat; the king my lord certainly knows best (ND 2766, ll. R 5-9; Nimrud Letters , pp. 161-63). In another Nimrud letter an of fi cial who pleads that he cannot carry out the king’s orders fi nds it prudent to disarm a possible rebuke by quoting what 108.

A hymn from the First Dynasty of Babylon says of Ištar: With this goddess there is counsel. The fate of everything she holds in her hand ( ANET , p. 383; SAHG B 1, ll. 13- 14; HPD , p. 39; Before the Muses , II.1, p. 69). In the Neo-Assyrian period queries were regularly addressed to Šamaš. 112 The advice may fi rst of all be given to the other gods. They seek the advice of Sin, for example: The great gods inquire of you and you give them advice ( SAHG B 52, l. 14; HPD , p. 278; Before the Muses , III.52[b], p. 667). Marduk is imagined acting in a similar capacity. 113 The advice reaches human beings through divination and oracles. 114 So in Israel: I will bless Yahweh, who has advised me (Ps. 16.7). 115 This would often be the result of consulting God at a sanctuary and receiving an oracle in reply. 116 The praise of Yahweh for his word and his law is a development of this gratitude for good advice. 117 Hyperbolic Expressions We may conclude this section on expressions of dependence by noticing that certain hyperbolic expressions are used of king and god alike.

We may recall Adad- šumu-usur’s praise of Aššurbanipal already quoted. 120 Aha-lurši tells Sargon that his deeds are far superior to those of his predecessors: Verily, [by Bel and Nabu, your gods,] there are no works done [under] your royal forefathers that can be compared to those [done] in the reign of the king, my lord!

The pharaoh, similarly, is a ‘brave warrior without match’, a ‘bowman with- out equal’. 121 There is, however, an awareness that this may be pardonable exaggeration: Strong King of whom one boasts; Sovereign of whom one exaggerates (B.G.

Strong, exalted, splendid are her decrees ( ANET , p. 383 [ SAHG B 1, ll. 21-24; HPD , p. 40; Before the Muses , II.1(vi), p. 69]). 122 It is found also in Egypt: O my God, Lord of the Gods, Amen-Re, Lord of the Thrones of the Two Lands! Give me a hand, deliver me, shine forth for me, may you enable me to live; You are the unique God, unequalled (Berlin 6910 H.6-7; Kitchen, Poetry , pp. 274-75). 123 Yahweh is praised in similar terms in the Old Testament: Who is like you among the gods, Yahweh? Who is like you, majestic in holiness, Inspiring reverent praise, performing wonderful deeds? (Exod. 15.11). 124 To the Ends of the Earth A passage which has often been cited as an important parallel with the Old Testament is the following, from a letter written by Tagi, who held territory on the coastal plain just south of Mt Carmel in the Amarna age: Should we go up into the sky, or should we go down into the netherworld, our head is in your hand (EA 264, ll. 15-19; Oppenheim, Letters , No. 71). 121.

Whereas the English ‘lament’ is a response to a situation about which nothing can be done, such as the death of Saul and Jonathan (2 Sam. 1.17-27) or the condition of Jerusalem after its fall (Lamentations), the German Klage can be used in the sense of a complaint about a situation which can still be recti fi ed. The lament is addressed to no one in particular; the complaint is addressed to someone who may be able to help. Hence some prefer to call the psalms in question ‘Communal (or Individual) Complaint Songs’. 4 But hesitations have been expressed about the appropriateness of the term Klage . According to Westermann, it is both too broad—covering lament for the dead and lament arising from distress—and too narrow—leaving out other important elements in the psalm. 5 The psalmists understand themselves to be uttering a ‘prayer’ ( hl f @ p i t @ ; ) or ‘supplication’ ( hn % F x i t @ ; , Nw % nx j t @ a ), in which the actual complaint or description of plight is only one element. 6 According 1.

Implications and Limitations  97  1 to Gerstenberger, the petition is the heart of the prayer, and ‘all the other elements can be interpreted as preparing and supporting the pe tition’. 7 Hence the type of psalm in question is sometimes termed Bitte or Bittgebet or ‘supplication’. 8 Although the terms ‘communal lament’ and ‘individual lament’ have been retained in this study, it should be seen as supporting the use of a more inclu- sive term. It is hardly conceivable that anyone would describe the Amarna letters or the Neo-Assyrian letters as ‘laments’. They are essentially appeals to the ruler to take action on the writers’ behalf, and help to show the psalms in that light. Who Were the Psalmists? Unlike the letter writers, the psalmists ha ve been very successful in conceal- ing their identity. They do not give their names, and introduce themselves and their circumstances only in the most general (and often metaphorical) terms. A fairly strong case can be made for regarding the speaker as the king in most if not all of the individual complaints and thanksgivings, whether or not he composed them himself. 9 This is based on the tradition which associ- ates so many of these psalms with David; on the use of expressions such as ‘my God’ that are taken to indicate a more intimate relationship with God than the ordinary worshipper would experience; and on the fact that the psalmist is represented as having many enemies and being engaged in battle with them. The chief dif fi culty is the marked difference in style between the unambiguously royal psalms and the individual complaints. But other fea- tures of the psalms of the individual have suggested that some at least are the prayers of private persons attempting to clear themselves of unjust accu- sations, 10 or seeking asylum because their lives are threatened, 11 or resorting to cultic procedures in the course of litigation. 12 The strength of these propos- als is that they are related to instituti ons which are attested elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible; their weakness is that there are no clear references to these 7.

The ancient Near Eastern archives ha ve yielded letters by a great number of people. Some are written by vassal kings to their Hittite or Egyptian over- lords; some by the governors of outlying provinces; some by scholars— priests, diviners or exorcists—at the Assyrian court; some by or on behalf of the citizens of a particular city. There is evidence that the letters of kings and of fi cials were written (and read) by professional scribes, but at the dictation of the king or of fi cial concerned. The overall impression is that there was a wide circle of people in the ancient Near East over many centuries who were accustomed to expressing themselves in writing, chie fl y in relation to their needs in their everyday lives. Although pre-exilic Israel may not have been as advanced culturally as Egypt and Mesopotamia and estimates of the level of literacy may be prob- lematic, 13 it is not at all improbable that a similar wide circle of people communicated by letter when need arose and therefore were accustomed to expressing themselves in writing as well as orally. Most of the Amarna letters were written from cities in or near Canaan, and it is unlikely that literacy skills would have been lost in whatever political or cultural changes took place subsequently. It was certainly th e understanding of Isr ael’s historians that rulers wrote and received lette rs (2 Sam. 11.14-15; 1 Kgs 21.8; 2 Kgs 5.5; 10.1; 19.14; 20.12; 2 Chron. 30.1, 6); a prophet might also do so (Jer. 29.1). Then we have the direct epigraphic evidence: the 48 letters which have been discovered, mainly at Tell ed-Duweir (biblical Lachish) and Arad. The extant letters are strictly functional and no literary merit can be claimed for them, though the writer of the Lachish letters replies spiritedly to accusations of neglect which have apparently been made. Not all those who could read and write would have thought of composing psalms. But it is at least a possibility that the psalms were contributed by a similar range of people in a variety of circumstances. Who those people were and what their circumstances were we shall never be ab le to assert with any certainty, but some suggestions may be made. The interpretation of the individual psalms as spoken by a king cannot be easily dismissed, but some of the arguments may not be as strong as at fi rst appears. The fact that the ancient Near Eastern letter writers routinely address the king as ‘the king my lord’ suggests that for the psalmists to address God as ‘my God’ is not necessarily an indication of special intimacy, but rather an expression of loyalty and dependence, and may have come naturally to those who asserted their loyalty to and dependence upon a human ruler.

Implications and Limitations  99  1 instances the enemies envisaged are foreign nations (Pss. 9–10; 18) and the circumstances are those of war (Ps. 27). But in others the enemies are closer to hand, neighbours and acquaintances, people who pass the psalmist in the street or call on him (Pss. 31.12 [ EVV 11]; 38.12 [ EVV 11]; 41.6-7 [ EVV 5-6]; 55.10, 12 [ EVV 9, 11]; 88.9, 19 [ EVV 8, 18]), even former close friends and relatives (Pss. 41.10 [ EVV 9]; 55.13-15 [ EVV 12-14]; 69.9 [ EVV 8]). Refer- ences to war here (Pss. 55.19, 22 [ EVV 18, 21]; 56.2-3 [ EVV 1-2]) border on the metaphorical: the element of physical danger is clearly there, but the enemies’ chief weapons are the smooth words they speak to the psalmist himself and the slanderous words they speak behind his back (Pss. 55.22 [ EVV 21]; 57.5 [ EVV 4]; 59.8 [ EVV 7]; 64.4 [ EVV 3]; 120.3-4). The psalmist could be a king, but there is no compelling reason to assume this. Psalm 59 is particularly ambiguous: the psalmist asks God to ‘punish all the nations’ (vv. 6, 9 [ EVV 5, 8]), but his enemies lie in wait for him and prowl about the city every evening (vv. 4, 7-8 [ EVV 3, 6-7]). There is just a hint of anti- monarchical sentiment in Ps. 76.13 [ EVV 12]). Psalm 107 catalogues some of those who would be expected to cry to Yahweh in their distress and to thank him for deliverance: refugees (vv. 4-9), prisoners (vv. 10-16), sick people (vv. 17-22) and sailors (vv. 23-32). Sick- ness is clearly the reason for the complaint or thanksgiving in Pss. 30; 38; 88; and 116, but in others there are complaints about enemies as well (Pss. 6; 22; 41). The one explicit reference to imprisonment is in Ps. 142.8 ( EVV 7). It is possible that some of the psalms in which the psalmist appeals to God for refuge or protection (Pss. 7.2 [ EVV 1]; 11.1; 16.1; 31.2 [ EVV 1]; 43.2; 71.1; 141.8) are the prayers of asylum seekers in the modern sense rather than those seeking sanctuary from blood vengeance, in the kind of situation envis- aged in Isa. 16.3-4; 21.14-15; Obadiah 14 and Ruth 2.12. The psalmists frequently describe themselves as ‘poor and needy’ (Pss. 40.18 [ EVV 17]; 70.6 [ EVV 5]; 86.1; 109.22). This need not mean that they were chronically poor in the economic sense. In other places they pray on behalf of the poor and the oppressed (Pss. 9.19 [ EVV 18]; 10.12, 17-18; 12.6 [ EVV 5]). The expression may be used in the sense of ‘the poor in spirit’ (Mt. 5.3). Or they may be temporarily poor, suffering the kind of hardships of which the letter writers complained. Psalm 71 stands out as the prayer of a man experiencing the anxieties that old age brings (vv. 9, 18). Many of the psalmists regard themselves as members of a group: of the righteous ( Myq i yd @ I c a , Pss. 5.13 [ EVV 12]; 64.11 [ EVV 10]; 140.14 [ EVV 13]), the faithful or loyal ( Myd I ys i x j , Myn I w % m) j , Pss. 4.4. [ EVV 3]; 30.5 [ EVV 4]; 31.24 [ EVV 23]; 32.6), the humble ( Myw I n F ( j , Ps 25.9) or the upright ( Myr I # $ f y : , Pss. 36.11 [ EVV 10]; 64.11 [ EVV 10]; 140.14 [ EVV 13]). These expressions, and the psalmist’s self-designation as ‘your servant’, are further af fi rmations of loyalty to God."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"100 ‘I have written to the king, my lord’ 1 Hitherto we have assumed that that the experiences described in the indi- vidual psalms were those of the psalmists themselves. It has frequently been supposed, however, that the psalms we re composed, not by the petitioners themselves, but by professional poets, the guilds of temple singers or cultic prophets. The grounds for this are that the composition of psalms requires skills that the ordinary worshipper would not have; that the formulaic and metaphorical language suggests compositions for repeated use; and that the later use of the psalms and the analogy of modern hymn books attests the willingness of worshippers to use prayers written by others. The temple singers are represented in 1 Chron. 16.4-36 as singing, and presumably com- posing, psalms, and the name of Asaph, their leader, appears in the super- scriptions to Psalms 50 and 73–83. It may be pointed out, however, that the psalms in 1 Chronicles 16—Psalms 106 and 105—are hymns, which would naturally be composed to be sung by or on behalf of a congregation of wor- shippers, and that none of the Asaphite psalms is a typical individual petiti on. While it is entirely understandable that people should ask a prophet to intercede for them (1 Sam. 7.8; 12.19, 23; 1 Kgs 17.17-24; Jer. 37.3; 42.2-4), the idea that a prophet or other cultic functionary should pray in the name of another person or compose a psalm for that person to sing or recite is much less plausible. It is hard to think of the note of urgency as coming from any- thing other than the authors’ own experience. Perhaps some of the psalmists were prophets or members of the temple personnel and the others were peo- ple closely associated with the temple or the court—a fairly restricted circle of literate people of standing, familiar with the traditional formulas and meta- phors which are repeatedly drawn upon. The analogy with modern hymn books does not suggest a different conclusion: the authors of many hymns are fi rst of all expressing their own faith and experience, though making it available for others to enter into and use. The Psalms and the Cult Many interpreters of the psalms have concluded that the psalms of the indi- vidual were sung or spoken or inscribed at a sanctuary, generally the Temple in Jerusalem. The most speci fi c argument is the number of references to ‘taking refuge under Yahweh’s wings’ (Pss. 1 7.8; 36.8 [ EVV 7]; 57.2 [ EVV 1]; 61.5 [ EVV 4]; 63.8 [ EVV 7]; 91.4). These are understood as indicating that the psalmist has literally put himself unde r God’s protection by taking refuge under the wings of the cherubim in the innermost room of the Temple 14 or at 14.

Implications and Limitations  101  1 least in their immediate vicinity, in the Temple area. 15 There are, however, dif fi culties with this in terpretation. Literally taking refuge under the wings of the cherubim invites the question: Did the ordinary worshipper have access to the inner sanctuary? It was the understanding of the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews that even the priests did not enter it, except for the high priest, and even he only once a year to make atonement (Heb. 9.6-7). This of course may have been a misunderstanding. The instructions for the making of the altar of incense say that Aaron (= the high priest) had the twice daily duty to offer incense on it (Exod. 30.7-8). And the restriction on access may have been a post-exilic innovation. The Chronicler’s account of Uzziah’s pre- sumption in offering incense on the altar allows that the priests generally might carry out this duty (2 Chron. 26.16-20), and the story of Korah’s revolt suggests that there was a time when an y member of the congregation might offer incense (Num. 16). An altar of incense, distinct from the altar on which other sacri fi ces were offered, may in itself have been an innovation in the Second Temple: there is no mention of such an altar in the account of the building of Solomon’s Temple, and earlier sanctuaries would seem to have had a single altar of earth or stone for all purposes (Exod. 20.24-26; Deut. 27.5-8; Josh. 8.30-31). One of those purposes was to provide a place of sanctuary for a person who had committed manslaughter or killed another accidentally (Exod. 21.12-14; cf. Deut. 19.4-5) or was otherwise in fear of his life (1 Kgs 1.50; 2.28). The fugitive grasped the horns of the altar, and there- fore, if any of the psalms are to be seen in the context of seeking asylum, it is surprising that there is no mention of the altar and its horns, but only of sheltering under God’s wings. A further dif fi culty is that it is unlikely that the wings of the cherubim would be termed ‘God’s wings’. The wings of the cherubim enable them to fl y and draw the divine chariot (Ps. 18.11 [ EVV 10]; Ezek. 1; 10); they have no protective function. On the other hand, Ruth may be said to have taken refuge under the wings of the God of Israel (Ruth 2.12) in a context which is clearly not cultic but indicative of the choice she has made: ‘Your people shall be my people, and your God my God’ (Ruth 1.16). In Ps. 17.8 ‘hide me under the shadow of your wings’ is balanced by ‘guard me like the pupil of the eye’—a highly fi gurative expression and nothing at all to do with the Temple. As with the references to the king’s shadow men- tioned above, ‘the shadow of God’s wings’ in the Psalms is a metaphor for God’s protection in general without an y reference to the contents of the Temple and their supposed function in cases of asylum. One of the ways of explaining the transition from complaint to con fi dence in the individual psalms is that the worshipper, present at a festival in Jerusa- lem, shared in the experience of a ‘t heophany’, ‘Yahweh’s self-revelation in 15. Beyerlin, Rettung der Bedrängten , p. 131."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"102 ‘I have written to the king, my lord’ 1 the presence of his people’. 16 Mowinckel understood this to be ‘visibly expressed through the symbols and rites’ of the enthronement festival and ‘the emotional reactions of the congregation’. 17 For Johnson the orientation of the Temple suggested that God’s appearance might have been symbolised at the moment when the early morning sun caught the cloud of incense in the inner sanctuary. 18 Weiser envisaged a visual and auditory experience: the congregation witnessed a ‘primitive drama’, in which the Sinai event was re- created, God’s presence being symbolised by the cloud of incense (Lev. 16.2; 1 Kgs 8.10-11) and the congregation responding by shouting and blowing of trumpets (Ps. 47.6 [ EVV 5]). 19 Kraus resisted the idea that the theophany could be produced by a ‘manipulation of scenes’, and thought that God’s appearing would be declared in a ‘charismatic proclamation’ by a prophet. 20 That there were festivals celebrated in Jerusalem is beyond dispute, t hough whether one of them was characterised by the enthr onement of Yahweh or the renewal of the Sinai covenant or the reaf fi rmation of the election of Zion may still be debated. That individuals claimed to have seen God in the Temple is also beyond dispute (Isa. 6; Ps. 63.3 [ EVV 2]). However, it is not at all certain that such individual experiences were the re sult of witnessing a ritual drama in the Temple at a festival: one prophet claimed to have seen God elsewhere, when no festival was taking place (Eze k. 1; 10.20); another seems to have received his vision after being summoned by the king to ‘inquire’ of God (1 Kgs 22.7-23). It is also unlikely that a psalmist in dire straits would have been reassured by a general reaf fi rmation of God’s concern for Israel. The analogy of the letters strongly suggests that only intervention in his own case, or at the very least an assurance of swift intervention, would have satis fi ed him. We have also seen that the language of ‘seeing’ the king is more impor- tant for its connotation of receiving th e king’s attention than for its literal reference. The psalmist is more anxious to be heard than to have or share in 16. Weiser, Psalms , p. 29. 17. Mowinckel, Psalms , I, p. 142. 18. A.R.

The Collections of the Psalms It has long been recognised that the Psalter must have been compiled from earlier collections, and Michael Goulder in a number of studies has argued that these collections and the order of the psalms within them are the key to the interpretation of the particular psalms. They were used in parallel with various narrative histories in liturgies performed at different periods and at different sanctuaries. The study most relevant to our present concerns is that on Psalms 51–72, 21 since it contains many of the individual complaints. Goulder points out that these psalms exhibit ‘a web of common language and ideas’ (though this is illustrated from only nine of the twenty-two psalms) and maintains that ‘the only plausible motive for the collection is liturgical’. The psalms are related to the incidents of the Succession Narrative with great ingenuity (‘far too interesting to be acceptable’) and the interpretation of some details undoubtedly bene fi ts from this fresh approach. But it is dif fi cult to accept that psalms as different in ch aracter as 53 (virtually the same psalm as 14), 60 (which shares a passage with 108), 68 and 72 were composed for the same liturgical sequence, and the nine psalms which exhibit ‘common language and ideas’ have more in common with individual complaints out- side the collection than with many of the psalms within it. Our study of the themes and motifs which appear in both the psalms and the ancient Near Eastern letters points to a general outlook and habits of thought rather than to a speci fi c liturgical context. Structure and Arrangement Some recent study of the psalms has focussed on the structure of individual psalms and on signs that their present arrangement is deliberate rather than haphazard. 22 It is hardly necessary to say that this study has nothing to con- tribute along these lines. The emphasis here has been on the themes and 21. M. Goulder, The Prayers of David (Psalms 51–72) (Studies in the Psalter, 2; JSOTSup, 102; Shef fi eld: JSOT Press, 1990). 22. Notably P.

R.C. Culley, in his study of formulaic expressions and their distribution in the Psalter, suggested that themes or motifs, ‘elements of subject matter or a group of ideas repeated in a variable form’, might usefully be investigated as ‘an intermediate structural device between the line and the poem itself’. 23 This would of course demand an examination of complete psalms to discover how the themes or motifs that have been identi fi ed interact and contribute to the impact of the psalm. Thematic Analysis The kind of analysis to which this study might lead would differ from the form-critical analysis which identi fi es the structural elements in a psalm (invocation, lament, confession of trust, petition, vow of praise), 24 and from the stylistic analysis which uncovers the artistic devices employed (inclusio, chiasmus, repetition, word-play, alliteration, assonance). 25 It would not be chie fl y concerned to identify the cultic b ackground. It would assume that the intention of the psalm is to persuade God to intervene on behalf of the individual or the people, and to show how the arguments stated or implied contribute to that end. We can only offer a few examples here. Psalms 25–28 form a convenient group of the psalms of petition under consideration, simi- lar in intent but varied in expression. Psalm 25 Psalm 25 relies heavily on expressions of dependence. The psalmist trusts God (v. 2), waits patiently for him (vv. 3, 5, 21), fi xes his gaze upon him (v. 15), and takes refuge in him (v. 20). He pleads for forgiveness (vv. 7, 11, 18). The appeal to God’s character, his mercy, loyalty ( ds e x e ) and faithfulness (vv. 6, 7, 10), exhibited in his past deeds (v. 6), may be read straightfor- wardly as a ground of con fi dence, or possibly as a gentle reproach: Why are these attributes not in evidence in my life? There is also an understated appeal to God’s own interests: if believers are put to shame (vv. 2, 3, 20), by suffering ill fortune and becoming objects of scorn, it is God’s reputation for mercy and loyalty that will suffer. The psalmist of course recognises that expecting God to keep his covenant obligations demands a corresponding 23. Culley, Oral Formulaic Language , pp. 99-100. 24.

Implications and Limitations  105  1 readiness on the part of the human partners in the covenant to do what God expects of them (v. 10). They must display integrity and uprightness (v. 21) and to that end rely on God’s guidance and instruction (vv. 4, 5, 8, 9, 14). The psalm does not stand out, however, as a passionate plea for God’s intervention. The acrostic form of course imposes constraints. But there does not seem to be any urgency about the petition. The references to the psalm- ist’s enemies are few, brief and widely separated (vv. 2, 3, 19). Although the appeal at the beginning and the end is addressed to God (vv. 1-7, 16-22), the middle of the psalm has a different audience in mind: those who need to realise afresh the goodness of God and the rewards of living in the right way (vv. 8-10, 12-15). The claim that this is deliberate artistry is questionable, as one of the appeals for pardon comes in the middle of the didactic section (v. 11). The psalmist is lonely and af fl icted (v. 16), but his distress is only brie fl y alluded to, and then in the most general terms. Despite the deployment of so many of the motivations for God to act, it has to be admitted that none are developed at any length, and that th e psalm reads more like an exercise than an outpouring of a person in desperate straits. Psalm 26 Psalm 26 is dominated by the psalmist’s protestation of innocence, not of any speci fi c misdeed, but of following a way of life of which God would dis- approve (vv. 1-5). His concept of the virtuous life is similar to that expressed in Psalm 1: he shuns the company of the wicked (vv. 4, 9-10). He symbol- ises his blameless life by a ritual act of handwashing (v. 6). He promises to testify publicly to God’s goodness (vv. 7, 12) and professes his love for God’s house (v. 8). Nevertheless he fears that despite his good character and unfailing trust (v. 1) he will not be treated any better than violent and corrupt men (vv. 9-10). This ought not to happen; the righteous should prosper (cf. Pss. 1.1-3; 25.13). Hence his prayer that God will vindicate him (v. 1), redeem him and be gracious to him (v. 11). The protestation of innocence and profession of devotion may be seen as arguments for God to show his favour, and the desired outcome to be a general improvement in the psalmist’s fortunes rather than a not guilty verdict on a speci fi c charge. Psalm 27 Psalm 27, like Psalms 9–10, 40 and 89, begins with con fi dence (vv. 1-6) but switches to complaint and appeal (vv. 7-14). There is no need to suppose that two psalms of different type have been inappropriately joined together. Although it is only in v. 12 that that the psalmist prays, ‘Do not hand me over to my adversaries’, the threat is there from the beginning and alluded to at various points (vv. 2-3, 6, 11). If he is not afraid, it is not because there is no danger, but because he can rely on God’ s protection (v. 5), provision (v. 13)"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"106 ‘I have written to the king, my lord’ 1 and patronage (v. 10). God’s protection is described in metaphorical terms: the desire to be constantly in God’s house, offering worship and seeking guidance (vv. 6, 8), is an expression of the psalmist’s loyalty rather than an indication that he has taken up permanent asylum in the temple. Another expression of his dependence on God is his willingness to wait patiently for the removal of the danger (v. 14). Psalm 28 The author of Psalm 28, like that of Psalm 26, is afraid that his fate will be no different from that of the wicked (vv. 1, 3; cf. Ps. 26.9). He does not however complain directly of any ill-treatment he is receiving at their hand. Nor does he appeal to God for help on the ground of his own good character. Avowal of dependence on God’s protection comes both at the beginning (‘my rock’, v. 1) and in the thanksgiving at the end, when he acknowledges that he has been heard. (‘Yahweh is my strength and shield, in him my heart trusts... Yahweh is the strength of his people; he is the saving refuge of his anointed’, vv. 7, 8). Since mention of any speci fi c distress is lacking, it is doubtful whether the psalmist’s gratitude is due to any marked change in his fortunes. He may have received a reassuring oracle, or he may have reached an inner conviction that his prayer has been heard. Analysis along these lines, with an awareness of the motivations of the ancient Near Eastern letter writers, shows that the individual complaint psalms display considerable variety in the situations envisaged and the argu- ments deployed. At the same time they illustrate in their different ways how the human situation of petition to a ruler helps to illuminate that of prayer to God. Theological Signi fi cance Brueggemann has proposed that a helpful way to understand the ‘function’ of the psalms is as a sequence of orientation–disorientation–reorientation. 26 This leads to form-critical analysis of the lament or complaint psalms and discussion of their theological signi fi cance. 27 Brueggemann argues that the psalmists’ situations should be studi ed from psychological and sociological 26.

The analogy of the letters cer- tainly supports the attempt to understand ‘the political, economic and social’ aspects of the complaint. Less convinci ng is the claim that the reorientation represented by the thanksgiving psalms and the thanksgiving element in the complaint psalms is radically different from the previous orientation. Resto- ration of the status quo ante is what most of the psalmists and letter writers hope for. Anything beyond that is expressed very tentatively. 28 Study of the Letters This study has been greatly facilitated by the excellent editions and transla- tions of the various collections of anci ent Near Eastern letters now available. In some ways they have been better served than the religious literature, which tends to be anthologised rather than treated comprehensively. Careful atten- tion has been given to textual and philological matters, and much effort has been put into establishing the historical and sociological context of the letters and their writers. The work done on the prosopography of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, 29 based to a large extent on the letters, must be the envy of the histo- rians of other civilisations and periods. But commentary on the letters has tended to be restricted to textual and philological matters. The publication of serviceable editions woul d probably not have been achieved without such self-discipline. It is hoped that this study will stimulate further attempts to explore the way the letter writers thought and conducted their relations with their rulers. 28. R. Tomes, ‘The Psalms’, in S.

Here we shall examine this thesis in greater detail than would have been appropriate in the main text. If we take as an example EA 264, ll. 15-19, Should we go up into the sky: ša-me-ma , or should we go down into the netherworld, our head: ru-šu-nu , is in your hand, the argument runs as follows. The passage occurs in the middle of a report on quite mundane matters. Tagi of Gezer is apologising that a promised caravan has not been sent to Egypt. The change to an elevated style suggests a quota- tion. Two words—‘sky’ and ‘our head’—are accompanied by Canaanite glosses. This suggests that the source of the quotation is not Akkadian but Canaanite. The passage can also easily be translated into Hebrew verse. The original is thus likely to be a poem of some kind. And the striking resem- blance of the content to that of an actual Hebrew psalm (Ps. 139.8-9) sug- gests that the quotation was being made from a religious hymn. The argument is at its strongest in relation to this particular passage. No other passage shows all the features mentioned quite so clearly. However, the argument for quotation is supported by the fact that other passages almost 1. O. Weber, in Knudtzon, Die El-Amarna Tafeln , II, pp. 1128, 1153, 1195-96, 1229, 1243, 1281, 1323-24. 2.

How could they coincide if they were not all quoting from a common source? Strong as the case may appear to be at fi rst sight, it has to meet fi ve objections: (1) It has not been con fi rmed from the Ras Shamra texts. The Amarna letters were of course discovered in 1887; Knudtzon’s edition of them was completed in 1915; and Böhl and Jirku had both put forward the theory of quotation from Canaanite hymns before 1928, when the fi rst discoveries were made at Ras Shamra. They must have been disappointed that none but the merest fragments of Canaanite hymns have been discovered 3 and that the mythological texts have not yielded any striking parallels to the Amarna passages in a religious context. Even if we turn to Psalm 29, the Hebrew psalm which is thought to be most probably an adaptation of a Canaanite psalm, because of its parallels with Ugaritic texts, the af fi nities with these Amarna passages are slight. In the psalm ‘the God of glory thunders’; in EA 147, ll. 9-15 the pharaoh ‘thunders in the sky like Baal so that the whole land trembles at his thunder’. In the psal m Yahweh ‘will bless his people with peace’; in EA the pharaoh ‘establishes the whole land in peace by the power of his arm’. It is true that one is more likely to say that a god thunders than that a king thunders, and so the latter idea must be secondary to the former. But the source need not be Canaanite hymnody, as we shall see. It is more immediately obvious that the king has es tablished the land in peace than that God has; there is no good reason therefore for assuming that this was origi- nally a religious idea. In the psalm the line comes in the context of Yahweh’s enthronement as king, so that it may be a conscious elaboration of that analogy. But even if the parallels were more signi fi cant than they are, we should still not be sure that the psalm was originally Canaanite. Direct con fi r- mation from Canaan of the Böhl–Jir ku thesis would still be lacking. (2) The motifs which are common to the Amarna letters and to known hymns and psalms are not con fi ned to these ‘poetic’ passages. Böhl and Jirku concentrated on what we have termed ‘expressions of dependence’ which are common to the Amarna letters and to psalms and hymns, such as the mighty hand or arm of the king, his life-giving breath, his protection rising like a wall of bronze, his being father and lord to his servant, seeking his face. But both letter writer and psalmist protest their loyalty. When Lab’ayu says, The fact is that I am a loyal servant of the king! I am not a rebel and I am not delinquent in duty. I have not held back my payments of tribute; I have not held back anything requested by my commissioner (EA 264, ll.10-15), 3.

Both are protesting their loyalty. Neither is quoting from the other, but it is natural for the psalmist to approach God in the same way as he would approach the king. Similarly, when ‘Abdi-Heba says, As the king has placed his name in Jerusalem for ever, he ca nnot abandon it (EA 287, ll. 60-63), he is appealing to the king’s own interests in the same way as the psalmist appeals to God’s: Remember the assembly of your people taken long since for your own, and Mount Zion, which was your home (Ps. 74.2). The analogies between the Amarna letters and religious literature are thus much wider than Böhl or Jirku recognised, and the expressions of dependence which attracted their attention need to be considered as one set of motifs among a number. (3) High fl own language in letters is not con fi ned to the Amarna texts. The Assyrian exorcist Adad-šumu-usur could be most eloquent and original in his praise of the king. 4 Something must be allowed to the skill and imagina- tion of the letter writers. Furthermore, the standard opening of an Amarna letter— At the feet of my lord, my sun, seven times and seven times I fall down— is very similar to that of Akkadian letters at Ugarit— At the feet of my master, from afar, twice seven times I fall down. Some of the features of Akkadian political correspondence are thus interna- tional, and it should not be assumed too readily that any elements in it have a purely local origin. (4) There have been one or two attempts to show that some of the motifs in question can be found used of the king in Egyptian inscriptions. Alt drew attention to four examples in an article published in 1933 5 and Albright 4. See, e.g., Oppenheim, Letters , Nos. 86; 87; 96. 5. A.

(a) Alt’s fi rst example was the comparison of the pharaoh with Baal in EA 147, ll. 10-15, who thunders in the sky like Baal so that the whole land trembles at the sound. 7 This sounds like clear evidence of a Canaanite source, until we realise that a number of Asiatic gods were domesticated in Egypt, and that Baal is the one most frequently mentioned. 8 Baal was equated with the Egyptian war gods, Montu and Seth, and his name was used in fi gures of speech relating to the pharaoh’s prowess in battle. The comparison is very frequent in the records of Ramesses III (‘He appears on the battle fi eld like Baal’, ‘He is like Baal at the time of his raging’, ‘His battle cry is like (that of) Baal in the heavens’), 9 but it also comes earlier, in a papyrus text of the poem on the battle Ramesses II fought at Kadesh. 10 There may be even earlier instances. 11 This use of the name of Baal is possibly a legacy of the Hyksos period in Egypt (eighteenth– sixteenth centuries BCE ). In the story of King Apophis and Seqnen-Re we are told that Apophis ‘made Seth his lord and served no other god in the whole land beside Seth’; 12 and Siegfried Morenz comments: ‘Here it may be assumed that Seth stands for the Syrian god Baal, because of all foreign deities Baal alone is designated in later Egyptian texts by Seth’s animal’. 13 Thus the comparison of the pharaoh with Baal could already have been familiar in Egypt by the beginning of the fourteenth century. (b) In EA 147, ll. 41-56, the pharaoh is described as a wall of bronze, and Alt pointed out that Seti I is referred to in that way: ‘A great wall of bronze protecting his army’. 14 Ramesses II is described as a ‘wall of iron (or 6.

The king’s protection of his army is constantly emphasised in Egyptian inscriptions, and the comparison of the pharaoh with a wall is older than the Amarna letters. Amenophis II is ‘a wall protecting Egypt’; 17 Sesostris III is ‘a dam and a rampart’. 18 (c) References to the king’s life-giving breath (EA 100, ll. 36-38; 137, ll. 5-15, 41-56) are also frequent in the inscriptions. It is the standard formula for captives pleading for the lives to be sp ared. ‘Give to us the breath, for it is yours, and no one can live without you’, say Libyan captives to Ramesses III. 19 ‘I am a sovereign bene fi cent to the trusting, mild, and giving breath to every nostril’, says Ramesses III to his princes, of fi cials and commanders. 20 The idiom appears from the time of Thutmose III onwards. 21 (d) Alt thought that the direct comparison of the Egyptian king with the sun or the sun god (EA 147, ll. 5-15, 41-56 22 ) was originally non-Egyptian. The familiar Egyptian title for the king is ‘son of Re’; the assumption of the direct title ‘the sun’ or ‘the sun god’ is more characteristic of, say, the Hittite kings. 23 However, the direct comparison has a long history in Egypt: the Instruction of Sheetep-ib-Re calls th e Twelfth Dynasty King Amenemhet III ‘Re, by whose beams one sees’. 24 In the opinion of Morenz the Egyptian king was originally identi fi ed with the god, but later people became increasingly aware that he was indeed a human being, and so the term ‘son of Re’, con- veying the notion of ‘only just’ divine, was added to the titulary from the Fourth Dynasty onwards, alongside ‘Horus’, the older term expressing iden- tity. 25 EA 147 does not contain any dogmatic identi fi cation of the king with Re. Re is clearly the king’s father (l. 8), and in l. 52 the reference to the sun is metaphorical, as is that to the wall of bronze. The king’s granting of life and protection is analogous to the functions of the sun and the wall. Comparison of the king with the sun or the sun god is frequent in the inscriptions of Amenophis III and Akhenaten. 26 There is no need to postulate any usage but Egyptian behind the references in the Amarna letters. 15.

Several of the ideas in EA 147, ll. 41-56, are found in a hymn to Amun of the next generation. 27 O Amun, you brazen rampart (?)... The sun of the one who does not know you, O Amun, sets. As for the one who knows you, he rises... The whole earth is in light. He who puts you entirely into his heart, O Amun, Behold, his sun rises. Language previously used of the king is here used exclusively of the god. Did its author derive it from previous hymns to the god or has he in reaction against exaggerated claims for the ki ng deliberately taken the courtly lan- guage of the Amarna age and appropriated it for the god alone? (f) In EA 73, ll. 35-38, Rib-Hadda says of Amanappa ‘You are father and lord to me’, and Jirku cited this because ‘father’ is commonly used to describe the deity in the Hebrew Bible. We may add that this usage is not con fi ned to the Hebrew Bible. Non-Israelite hymns compare the god with father and mother. 28 But Rib-Hadda may be acknowledging Amanappa as his patron, just as in EA 286, ll. 9-13, 287, ll. 25-28 and 288, ll. 13-15, ‘Abdi-Heba of Jerusalem is acknowledging the king as his patron. This was not mere rhetoric in the time of the Eighteenth Dynasty. According to W.C. Hayes ‘more than one of fi cial of the Eighteenth Dynasty boasted that at the start of his career he was “without (in fl uential) kindred” or that he was “humble of family, one of small account in his town” ’. 29 The pharaoh’s of fi cials were a ‘new aristoc- racy’, and it was natural to them to express appreciation of patronage. André Barucq cited evidence 30 that the courtiers of Akhenaten were particularly prone to these sentiments, and maintained that they did borrow the language of religious hymns. One refers to Akhenaten as the one who ‘has built me, created me, caused me to exist’; another says that Akhenaten has caused him to take his place ‘among men’. The king is the ‘destiny of their life’, ‘breath for every nose that breathes’, ‘the god who gives life’. The language here is fulsome and no doubt borrowed from religious sources. But the references to 27. Cf. Erman, Ancient Egyptians , pp. 309-10. 28. E.g. ANET , pp. 385-86, 392, 397, 401; Before the Muses , I, p. 159, II, pp. 576, 585-87, 589, 672. 29.

(g) In EA 147, ll. 5-15, the king ‘establishes the entire land in peace, by the power of his arm’. Praise of the king for bringing peaceful conditions is of course one of the themes of the Merenptah stele 31 and it occurs in other inscriptions as well. 32 (h) The expression ‘under the feet of the king’ (EA 292, ll. 13-17; 296, ll. 17-22; 266, ll. 16-25) is a very frequent one in Egyptian inscriptions. 33 It expresses subjection, and while it is not an exclusively Egyptian idiom, it is one that is entirely expected in Egyptian documents. (5) The fi nal objection to the view that the pharaoh’s correspondents drew upon Canaanite hymnody is that some of the motifs are to found in letters from the pharaoh. It is not of course suf fi cient to demonstrate that the motifs are Egyptian: one must also show how the correspondents in Syria and Pales- tine came across them. Alt believed that there must have existed ‘a collection of approved formulas’ in Akkadian which correspondents could draw upon when they wrote to the court. 34 This was rejected by Böhl 35 on the ground that there is no trace of such collections in the ancient Near East. We have already seen that the opening formula, ‘At the (two) feet of my lord, my sun, seven times and seven times I fall down’, must have been common to the Akkadian international correspondence of the time. That there should be formulas for conventional openings to letters and routine reports is understandable enough. It is less likely that there were formulas to cover every variation of content. One source from which correspondents would be likely to learn acceptable expressions, however, would be the pharaoh’s own letters. We do not have any matching pair of letters in the Amarna corpus, but we have some ten letters from the king to various vassals, of fi cials and foreign kings. The phrase ‘under the two feet of the king’, which we have just been considering, occurs in a latter from Amenophis III to Milkilu of Gezer: Amun has indeed put the Upper Land, the Lower Land, where the sun, šamaš , rises, where the sun, šamaš , sets, under the feet of the king (EA 369, ll. 28-32). We note here that the king uses Canaanite glosses in his letters. This shows that, whatever the purpose of the glosses may be, they provide no conclusive evidence that a correspondent is quoting from a Canaanite source. The theory that writers quoted back to the king language he had used in letters to them may possibly explain the occurrence of the same passage in the three letters 31.

We should have to assume that the king wrote in such terms as these: You have looked here and you have looked there, but there is no light. And you have looked upon the king, your lord, and it is bright. And though one brick should move from under another, you shall not move from under the two feet of the king, your lord. This is not an entirely satisfactory explanation of the coincidence of the three passages. One would expect the writers repeating the king’s words to preface them with a formula of quotation, such as, ‘You have said...’ Another sug- gestion is that the writers were quoting poems addressed to the king rather than hymns addressed to a god. 36 But it is more likely that something the pharaoh did or said prompted them to write in the same terms than that they each independently quoted from the same hymn or poem or chose the same passage from a stock collection of approved formulas. A number of the letters mention seeing or seeking the king’s face (EA 147, ll. 59-60; 165, ll. 4-8; 166; ll. 6-8; 169, ll. 7-10) or speak of the king giving life (EA 169, ll. 7-10; 238, ll. 29-33). For a possible source for these letters we need look no further than a letter from the pharaoh to Aziru, the ruler of Amurru: Come yourself, or send your son, and you will see the king, at whose sight all lands live (EA 162, ll. 48-50). The description of the king as the sun or as like the sun (EA 147, ll. 5-8, 52-56) was certainly used by the king as well as by his subjects: And know that the king is hale like the sun in the sky (EA 162, ll. 78-79; 367, l. 22). The case for quotation from Canaanite hymns in the Amarna letters is thus a good deal weaker than appeared at fi rst sight. The surmise has not been borne out by any material from Ras Shamra; the motifs which appear in the ‘hymnic’ passages are familiar from Egyptian sources; some of them even appear in what examples we have of the king’s letters. What does emerge from a comparative study of the Amarna letters and religious texts is not that the one contains quotations from the other but that there is a broadly based analogy between the way a man addressed his king and the way he addressed his god, and that for the most part it is the human situation which has imposed its pattern on the religious situation and not vice versa. 36.
