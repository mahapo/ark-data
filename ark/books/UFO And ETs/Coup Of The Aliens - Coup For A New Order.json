[{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Unidentified Flying Objects, unexpla ined abductions, cattle mutilations: Are these the work of some advanced extraterrestrial beings bent on unlocking the physical and psychologica l secrets of Earth's inhabitants, or is something even more sinister at work? Ernest G. Takala's Coup of the Aliens: Coup for a New Order asserts this is not the work of alien forces but rather of governments and economic powers. Takala, utilizing the advanced military and medical technology of Nazi Germany, contends that secret government agencies are playing upon the UFO myth to continue carrying out the experiments begun in the Nazi death camps of World War II. Nazi s who, with the aid of America's secret intelligence organization, fled to South America in the collapse of Hitler's Third Reich have since further developed the weapons, aircraft, and medical technology they formulated in the 1930s and 1940s. Takala explains in detail how these UFOs work and who their alien inhabitants really are. Tying in international finance, the \"super rich,\" the \"New World Order,\" and satanic forces, Takala paints a picture of the frightening revelation of what truly lies behind the alien sightings so prevalent today. About the Author Ernest G. Takala's personal experience with UFO sightings, along with his avid interest in science and militar y history, led him to research and develop theories about the nature of alien sightings.

Much of this story is based on facts, and part of it is based on speculation. In the opinion of this author, the historical facts plus a close sighting by the author was sufficient reason to formulate this theory. I write this story to inform the public of a possibly urgent matter. The urgency may not be immediate because it is of great future consequence. However, to avoid a future which may be very bleak and sinister, one must understand with a greater perspective, the proper view of the subject matter, namely, the UFO phenomena. To begin with, the real truth of the UFO phenomena is that we are not being visited by extraterrestrials, but instead we are being made fools of by cunning covert operations on the part of various governments. This began in approximately 1937 in Nazi Germany. At that time Germany's military industrial complex was secretly producing many different types of unconventional aircraft and other exotic weapon systems to be used at a later date if not immediately. Although Germany was not at war at the time, they were preparing themselves for fu ture conflict. Hitler's plan was to expand Nazi influence and power beyond its existing borders. Germany began to Prussianize itself on the m odel of the great Prussian military state. It produced a great standing army, well equipped and superbly trained in the arts of war. It would la ter become the world's first mechanized mobilized military force, with technologies far surpassing most of its opponents. Germany paid the greatest attention to creating a vast array of aircraft, realizing the importance of air superiority. During the war which eventually developed, Germany wa s to succeed beyond her wildest dreams... at least for the first three years. After that her fortunes turned. As 1"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"soon as Hitler took over command of his general staff following some disappointments and disagreements with his generals, disaster after disaster plagued Germany. Also, due to Hitler's fanatical zeal, he placed his priorities less on winning the war than on his occult mission of sacrificing the Jews and murdering as many eastern Europeans (especially if they were Communists or Communist symphasizers) as he possibly could. Those in high places within the Third Reich who could see the future fate of the war effort's impending doom made preparations for themselves and their families to escape to far away places in the world. They would accomplish this through their own inner circle of friends and accomplices. Even the American army in telligence agency of that time (the OSS) would become an accessory in order to a ttain German intelligence, know-how, and a host of other desirable expertise such as science and technology, including in the field of medicine. Incidentally, modern medicine in America has been greatly enhanced by this technology. The Gestapo was even cordially asked to staff and train the OSS with people of its own and to organize it in the manner of the Gestapo. The OSS would never be the same again. In fact, it would have a new name as well. It would now be known as the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). It would take on a much more pragmatic posture now, to say the least. \"Infamous\" would be a more appropriate term. Other bargaining powers the escapees had were their secret aircraft (flying saucers) and other technologies they succeeded in escaping with, as well as all the valuable loot which was taken from the occupied countries while they were there. This booty would be their main ticket out of Europe and used to pay their way to foreign countries (especially South American countries where they could count on a very friendly welcome from most of the dictators there). Opportunity had knocked. The dictators loved the loot and needed their newly arrived friends for other reasons as well. The new arrivals could teach their host countries how to combat terrorism and show them how to create anti- communist fronts along with commando operatives. The best part of the whole plan would be that they could stay hidden from most of the world and be protected by the host countries and their CIA a llies while they continued working on secret technologies flying craft (flying saucers) they might sell to the highest bidder (usually the U.S. A.). Over time they would teach their children how to fly them, and their children would teach the Americans and others how to fly them. By constructing safe hideaways inside mountains and underground (with the host governments' aid) they could build the factories which would manufacture more saucers and other exotic devices. Of course, the 2"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"best way to sell all their goodies w ould be to sell everything piece by piece over a period of many years. Of course, they coul d look forward to the utmost secrecy as well as protection from their friends at the CIA. Because of the performance capabilities of flying saucers (especially hoverabiltiy) and their silence, a continuance of exotic medical experiments performed on the hapless inmates at the various death camps would now be possible by abducting animals and people in remote places. One man's work in particular comes to mind: Dr. Mengele, the notorious \"Angel of Death.\" The best way to do this would be to use tranquilizer guns or other devices to paralyze their intended victims. Contrary to popular opinion the death camps during the war were an important factor in creating much in the way of modern medicine and more efficient medical tools. So, ironically, the flying saucers would now be used at some time for such experiments. To control public outrage over these flying death camps, it would be of vital importance not to let the general public know exactly what was going on. They would have to be deceived and confused and also divided, thus the public camps of believers and nonbelievers. This could be accomplished easily through an extraterrestrial visitation charade. Hollywood-style masks and costumes would be used. More likely than not midgets, and in certain circumstances, even monkeys would be used. In one popular case a dummy was used for a phony autopsy. One wonders also about the so-called cattle mutilations and what purpose they serve. One possibility which exists is the creation of new deadly viruses. Perhaps AIDS was crea ted by splicing the RNA molecules of a particular sheep and cow virus, which is not dangerous to humans unless the two spliced halves are merged togeth er surgically to create an entirely new virus which is deadly to mankind. Thus it may very well be that they have created a population control weapon to sell to various secret intelligence agencies worldwide, in turn, to be used by those governments to rid themselves of their undesira bles and certain ethnic groups. Such plans are probably in the interest of an oligarchy. By volunteering their services to an oligarchy, they have positioned themselves very well within the world's systems (in particular the super-rich Eastern Establishment). If they are able to stay at least ten years ahead of the rest of the world in certain strategic technologies (with help from the superrich); then some of the effects created by flying saucers to fool witnesses would seem magical or extraterrestrial. The most important way to fool the public is by abducting individuals. Realizing in advance that sooner or later the abductee would in some way remember his or her experienceâ€”even though the victims had been 3"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"paralyzed, hypnotized, drugged with hallucinogenics, etc., it was necessary, as mentioned before, to confuse the victim through the use of strange costumes and masks. Also, very little information would be given to the victim if he or she should ask. If information was given to them, it would be nonsense or half-truths. While victims were in such an altered state of mind, they would tend to believe things much more readily. It appears to the author of this manuscript that something else important is going on inside these flying laboratories. That is the placing of a small transmitting device somewhere inside the victim, much the same as when wild life workers tag an animal so th at it can be located more easily on some future date. There may be a long-range sinister plan on the part of international bankers and conglomerate corporations bent on monopolistic and socialistic designs to have total control over every living soul on planet Earth. It is becoming more and more possible that in the near future every action and possibly every thought of every individual will be monitored by way of small implanted bio-chip computer devices surgically implanted under the skin. This device could be implanted in the head or attached to a main nerve in the body in order to relay signals (information) to the brain or receive information from the brain. Then the information would be centralralized in the world computer system. When this happens Big Brother will be everywhere (in you and out of you). My sole purpose in writing this manuscript is to alert as many people as I possibly can to the true nature of flying saucers. There is too much disinformation in books, magazines, TV, and the movies. The majority of people in the world probably believe our earth is being visited by extraterrestials. This is danger ous politically, as a government or governments can seize upon this situation to install a totalitarian-type regime and perhaps already do plan such a scenario for our near future. The governments of the world are already under the control of international bankers and conglomerate corporations. The only ones to gain out of a fascist socialistic regime for an entire worldwide government would be them. More on this later. There are man-made secret multi-purpose aircraft (flying saucers) capable of using various propulsion syst ems. I advise everyone to begin in- depth research of all the facts of mode rn history, especially just before, during, and just a little after World War II. You will be amazed at what you might find. Much has definitely been censored, but a few things have been missed by the censors. During the last months of World War II, Germany was desperate for fuel. In her desperation she sought out various synthetic types of fuels. Electrical 4"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"energy became their main choice, but the saucers were the only aircraft they had which could operate solely upon electric current without having to rely on any other type of fuel. This author (E.G. Takala) believes hydroelectric generators, the same type as are used in dams) had been placed in the saucers, most likely in the outer rim which is circular (donut- shaped hollow tubing), surrounding the center pilot and crew areas of the craft. The tubing was made to carry a mixture of water and mercury for the conduction of electrical current created by the hydro-electric generators. The water was spun around the tubing and through the hydro-electric generators until it created a powerful electrical charge (possibly powerful enough to light up a small town). This would eventually heat the water enough so that it could be used to lift the craft (similar in principle to the way the Sun's rays play on water and draw it up to form cloud layers over the earth). With proper control, the craft would lift only as high as desired by the pilot (perhaps only to hover a few feet above ground). In retrospect some UFO witnesses have claimed to have seen a craft create its own artificial cloud covering to hide itself. This would be easy to do if, like a steam pressure cooker, it released enough steam from th e vents in the tubing, thus cloaking itself in a form of camouflage. Keeping control of such a system might be quite dangerous and could possibly explain some sightings in which witnesses have claimed they have actually seen the explosion of such craft. This particular method of propulsion is probably based on a more primitive type of toy the Romans of ancient times actually had. The toy, which was made of iron, was filled with water and then heated to a high temperature. At the right time vents were opened for the steam pressure to come out, and away it flew into the air. Since this toy is an historical fact, and the artifact does exist, I feel we should be asking the obvious question concerning flying saucers. Keep in mind, however, that this is only one propulsion method the saucers use. Vertical lift propellers are also used. Now it stands to reason that the gov ernments of the world, being under control of international bankers as they are, do not wish for the general public to know too much about alternative propulsion systems since it could upset the oil cartels and their greedy monopolistic empires. Can you imagine how much international bankers stand to lose with all the stock shares they have invested in oil? There are other reasons for secrecy as well, possibly what was mentioned earlier in this book about the creation of a New World Order, and its trickle-down effect of a one-world religion and a one-world monetary system. A government run by the super rich could have its own hand-picked messiah (antichrist?) with the Fuher concept and new laws promoting socialistic ideals for all the 5"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"rest of us, like it or not. This, of course, will go hand in hand with a new religious system for everyone (watered down to satisfy a majority of planet Earth's people), and of course, last but certainly not least, an economic system which is totally electronic and cashless. (Thus international bankers will have succeeded in stealing all the world's mineral wealth for themselves while giving all the rest of us electronic numbers to use in all our financial transactions.) International bankers already have succeeded in hoarding most of the world's mineral resources. They have even taken over most of the farm land from the people. In order to bring all their designs into reality they will first have to convince us their New World Order is the best thing for us. The Christian Bible speaks of such times in Revelation (the last book of the Bible) when it mentions that he (antichrist) will seek to change laws and times and will speak flatteries and speak of peace a nd security but will destroy without warning (by spreading viruses created for bacteriological warfare?). He will even make a law in which every li ving soul on earth will be forced to take a mark on either their forehead or their right hand (computerized bio- chip) on penalty of death by decapita tion if they refuse. The number that the Bible says he will want us to ta ke will be the number of the \"Beast\" number 666. The Bible also says that during the \"Tribulation\" there will be lying signs and wonders in the sky heralding the coming of the devil's chosen one. Flying saucers landing at most of the world's capitals after a grand display of themselves and pret ending the occupants are God's angels bringing back His chosen one? Do not be deceived, for this will actually be the antichrist. We will probably be told of a great galactic federation and live on Earth as the angles live in the heavens. Remembering back to World War II days, we recall that Dr. Mengele, too, was known by the inmates of those infamous concentration camps as an angel, an angel of death, that is. I feel it to be very appropriate to bring up the subject of Dr. Mengele once more. It is mentioned in history that when he was conducting his weird experiments on the prisoners, it had been noted that his goal was to unlock the genetic mysteries concerning dwarfs (a genetically created hybrid to be used as the small crew members in the saucers?) and twins (a cloned Hitler DNA cell artificially inseminated at a later date to grow into adulthood and carry on the programs of the Third Reich?). Now thinking back to some of the abduction cases reported in UFO books, doesn't it strike you as strange that there is usually a taller being who seems to be in charge of the smaller creatures? Perhaps the smaller creatures were never intended to be in tellectually designed. Perhaps their only function is to carry out menial tasks. They may even be completely 6"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"controlled mentally by way of surgically implanted bio-chips in their brains. The taller ones are usually refe rred to as the leaders or the head surgeons. These are probably no rmal people wearing disguises. If anyone has read the entire story of the Betty and Barney Hill case, they would have come across a certain part in it in which Barney Hill screams out during one of his hypnosis sessions, \"They're Nazis, they're Nazis.\" Most writers (especially those who lean towards the alien hypothesis) fail to mention this little episode. Obviously Barney was a very good observer, and Betty was not. Barney must have seen something he was not supposed to see. Sometimes abductees have me ntioned that the so-called extraterrestrials are able to communicate with them by way of telepathy, but is there a way to communicate mind to mind other than through telepathy? The answer to that is that there probabl y already has been, and this brings us back to the bio-chip once again. It may just be that these bio- chips (sometimes known as transponders) are much more technologically advanced than we think. Perhaps the type they use in their victims is quite capable of two way signals. If so, then they can not only track down anyone who has one of these implants, but al so feed information to or receive information from him or her. In other words, their victims' most private thoughts can actually be intercepted and possibly even recorded. If this is happening, the most perfect Big Brother surveillance system is being prepared for all mankind. All one will have to do is to take the mark (the individually numbered transponder of the Beast). I believe many different types of tools and other devices, vari ous types of new technologies, and even new medicines and bacteriological warfare viruses are applied to the victims of UFO abductions. Such abductees are being used as guinea pigs. Many of these devices and medicines, etc., are later found to be on the market after being successfully demonstrated inside the saucers (flying death camp laboratories). As the author of this manuscript, 1 (E.G. Takala) feel it is imperative I make it clear to the reader that I know for certain the flying saucers were made by Germany during the second world war. The reason I can make such a statement is because of a close sighting I had while still a youth (I was sixteen years old at the time.) It was the year 1957 when I saw it. At that time I did not know what to make of it. I could not even figure out what it was. Then around 1984 (twenty-seven years after the event) I was browsing in a used book store when I spotted a book about flying saucers, with a rather unconventional title. It was called UFOs, Nazi Secret Weapon? There were two authors, Mattern and Friedrich. 1 decided to buy the book. I was to have the most astonishing surprise of my life. On page 119 7"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"was an engineering drawing, with German words on it, of the same thing in every detail of what I remembered seeing in the sky in 1957. Never in my wildest dreams did I expect to find in the pages of a book the machine I once saw in the sky. This is significant because it means I am actually able to say that I am able to identify what I saw. In other words, what I saw is no longer a UFO, but instead it is an identified object. At this point I shall proceed to describe the craft to the best of my ability. For one thing, at the beginning of my sighting this thing was completely motionless, and it remained motionless throughout the entire time I stayed there to watch it. I watched it approximately two hours, and it was only about two hundred feet in the air and in the north west sector of the sky. The time was about nine-thirty in the evening, and it was July. It was a brilliant sight to see as there were a variety of different colored search lights on top of what I would call, at that time, the upper deck. There was what looked like an inverted cup in the center of the top of the deck. The dome was florescent orange with black riblike lines vertically placed around the dome. Below the platform was what looked like an under carriage for a dirigible, except it was a flat military black with iridescent green windows. You could not see through these windows from the outside, but I would be w i l li n g to bet whoever was inside could see out. Other features were a flat black tail, a black rocket motor pipe, and black inflatable shock absorbers underneath th e carriage. The search lights, as I call them, were extremely bright. They were so bright they lit up the sky just like daylight in the direction they shone. Not too long ago a Vietnam veteran told me that during his tour there he witnessed powerful lights from American fighter bombers which, when pointed downward, could light up everything below as bright as day. 1 also recently happened to come across a book about ace pilots of World War II which explained how some German pilots experimented with powerful lights which they would use in their slow-flying Stukas, which were no match for the faster American P-51s. What they would do was shine the light at the cockpit of the allied aircraft, blinding the allied pilot long enough for the Stuka to get away. I would like at this time to note a few important facts concerning the situation of the German nation during World War II. As tacticians, the German general staff and officers all the way down to the company commanders had proven themselves time and time again to be quite capable, innovative, and resilient unde r the harshest and most strained battlefield conditions. As for the common German soldier himself, he was extremely well trained and disciplined and, more likely than not, was probably among the world's best combat soldiers of the war. The German 8"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"navy and air force could be equally commended for these capabilities. However, in spite of all this and in spite of the tremendous power the German nation had achieved at her height in 1942, her grand strategy was totally lacking. All her brilliant successe s in the previous years would be in vain as the Fuhrer took on more and more responsibilities and demanded impossible goals from his generals. Since the generalship was afraid of the Fuhrer and his loyal SS, they would obey the Fuhrer even while knowing Hitler's strategy was incorrect and foolish. Hitler had brainwashed himself into believing in his own superior intellect and invincibility. He made himself into a god-man. The Fuhrer was now completely in charge of all military operations. His generals could no longer think freely for themselves as the Fuhrer would make all the important decisions from this point on. As a result of this, Germany would suffer reverse after reverse and ultimately total defeat. In actuality Germ any went far to defeat herself. She thus proved to all thinking people worldwide that a totalitarian state is intellectually defective and self-defeating. Today we are threatened with a new and far worse form of totalitarianism. It is much more subtle and deceiving. A New World Order is emerging from the depths of Hell, with the Eastern Establishment at its reigns. That is the one world government and world religion and world economy we have mentioned earlier in this manuscript, a world in which international bankers and conglomerate corporations will rule over governments. Already their power is immense. Their influence on the foreign policy of major nations is quite noticeable if one examines current events and recent history. So-called democracy as it is today is less and less the government of the people as politicians become puppets of their money masters the: evil merchants and money lenders. Because of their unholy alliance, that is the alliance between the Nazi escapees and the world's financially pow erful elite, the Nazis live safe and secure in complete luxury in their colonies. Even the CIA is known to have funded them in many ways and continues to do so at present. This is in addition to the fact that they can also expect powerful protection from the intelligence agency. Once again Jesus gave us fair warning in his days when he said that there was a conspiracy amongst the kings of the earth and the rich men of the eart h against us and against God. Our leaders may inform us of the impending New Order (which will also coincide with the loss of national sovereignty) and of how much better it will be for us-an end to wo rldwide hunger, an end to war, peace and safety for everyone, plus security, an end to most crime, more openness in society, and democracy for the entire world, but do not be deceived. For this is how they will bring in their mixed bag of socialism, blending 9"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"of right wing and left wing socialism. The super rich have always hated capitalism. (They can't stand competition but love monopoly.) As you have probably noticed, small businesses are disappearing rapidly and are being replaced by large chains a nd shopping malls as big business continues to wipe out the small. The larger businesses usually don't compete with one another and instead try to keep out of each other's way. If one really thinks about it, it isn't too hard to see that Satan is indeed alive and well and is the prince of the air and the holder of the light. He is in complete control of the minds of the world's greediest, most corrupt, and most power-hungry individuals. As Jesus warned us once again, in those end times the merchants of the earth would be our kings, and they would all think with one mind and in one hour with the Beast. They would give him leadership over all the earth, (This could probably be done through U.N. legislation with the super rich controlling the U.N.). I, the author, feel it is important to note the fact that (Ernest G.

Thanking you, 10"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"A Final Note: In 1989 this author (Ernest G. Takala) was to be a witness once again to the sighting of the same type of saucer. My older daughter, who was fifteen years old at the time, was with me. We were returning to my house after seeing a movie and were traveling north down Cicero Avenue. As we approached Midway Airport, which was off to our left, something caught my eye. As I looked toward it 1 was surprised to see once again the same type of object I had seen many years previously in 1957. This particular saucer was the prototype of its kind produced by the Germans, and it was known as the Wing-Wheel Airplane. 1 brought it to my daughter's attention, and she asked me what it was. I was a bit shocked and surprised at what we were witnessing, and my own mind just found it difficult to believe I could be seeing the same thing again and so I made the statement that it must be a balloon or something, nevertheless it was traveling pretty fast and coming up from one of the runways of the airport. It was slightly tilted on its way up. As it leveled off in front of us it began to travel in a definite north east direction. My mind continued to rationalize what I was observing, and now 1 suggested that perhaps it was a dirigible. 1 just couldn't accept the fact that I was once again seeing the same thing I had seen in 1957. The only difference this time was that it had no search lights shining from it and it had no undercarriage beneath it (I believe the undercarriage is retractable), nor did it have a tail behind it. (1 believe this, too, is retractable.) Another difference to note was that on top of the dome was a red blinking light just as regular airplanes would have. Other than these particular differences, everything else about the craft was the same as in 1957. After reflecting on this event the next day, I began to 1 1"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"realize why my mind had such a hard time coping with my second sighting: In my subconscious I just couldn't believe that after nearly half a century the same type of model was still in use clandestinely. I cannot explain this, but I know I saw what I saw. Perhaps the saucers were made more technologically superior than we might imagine, so superior that even with today's greatly advanced jet aircraft we are still behind in such technology. Oh yes, there was one other difference of minor importance, and that was the color of the dome. This time instead of florescent orange it was florescent green. We followed behind this thing as long as possible, but eventually it was lost to our sight as it disappeared behind building structures. The next day I checked all the major Chicago newspapers to see if anyone else reported seeing this thing, but I found nothing. This did not surprise me as I was already informed of the fact that the people who work in the airport control towers of this country are not allowed to report UFO sightings for fear of loss of their jobs . As for airline pilots, they, too, are warned by their superiors not to disclose any information about sightings of such craft. In fact, it is probably worth noting at this time that even military pilots are not allowed to mention anything like this to the media either, upon penalty of court martial. This was the second and last time I saw anything of this sortâ€”as of this writing. 12"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 13"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Coup for a New Order?

We reproduce here a few of his photo copies which date back as far as 1941. Hermann Klaas knew Victor Schauberger personally and transported U.F.O. parts from Mauthausen to Vienna and most likely to the factory named Kertl which is mentioned in the book \"Flying Saucers over South Afri ca\" written by Sievers. The director of this Viennese firm complained once to Klass about the fantastic speed and silent take-o ff of Schauberger's invention which had caused the hole in the roof â€” earlier reported.
