R idge was the Director of the UFO Filt er Center at Mt. Vernon, Indiana, from 1973 to 1995, doing special computer studies on regional and national UFO sightings. He is currently a researcher and field investigator for the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS). His official experience with UFO investigation and research began at Vincennes, Indiana, in 1960 when he was appointed Chairm an of Indiana Unit No. 1, of the National Investig ation s Comm ittee on Aerial Phenom enon ( NICAP). Hi s seven m an t eam was one of four such NICAP team s in the state. In 1972, after m oving to Illinois, h e becam e a MUFON State Section Director for a th ree county area located at Hillsboro, IL. In 1973, he returned to Indiana where he becam e the MUFON State Sectio n Director for three county area located at Mt. Vernon, IN. To m ake it easier for the public to report UFOs to local autho ritie s he estab lished the UFO Filter Cen ter and work ed close ly with th e m edia and law enforcem ent agencies in the area. As part of this effort he au thored and distributed a monthly status report on UFO sightings. He appoi nted a num ber of \"spotters\" throughout the area and trained som e of these as UFO field investigators. In 1986, he becam e the MUFON State Directo r for Indiana, which becam e known a s The Indian a Group with approxim ately 150 m ember s and 36 field investigators.

UFOs can som etim es appear and disappear as if by m agic, but if you can hit it with a rock or shoot it with a gun and it clanks, its som ething real. If you can pick it up on radar, chase it with a jet intercepto r, get gun cam era photos o f it; it’s no t an apparitio n. These things land, leave indentations in the ground, and break off tree limbs. They are real! There are other things that look like UFOs but we ar e not concerned with them here. Som e of these are, in fact, IFOs or Identified Flying Objects. Som e of the ot her visions belong in other realm s; possibly the supernatural. Som etim e in 1956 a friend of m ine handed m e a pa perback book to read. I didn' t read m any books in those days, but this one really got my attention. I sim ply couldn' t put it down. To say that I was fascinated w ith it would be an understatem ent. That book had a profound effect on my entire life because it drew m e in to the UFO c ontroversy. The book was Edward Ruppelt' s Report on Unidentif ied Flying Objects . Captain Ruppelt had been head of Air Force Project B lue Book in the early 1950s. And, as you will see, th ese were the y ears in wh ich the Air F orce put its best foot forward in UFO investigations. Incidental ly, that book is now on the NICAP site at: http://www.nicap.org/rufo/contents.htm That book convinced me that I just had to, som ehow, get involved. If Earth was being visited by beings from another world, the im plications for hum anity were to great to ignore. Even if UFOs didn' t physically ex ist, so mething just as im porta nt was tak ing place. Too m any creditable peop le were seeing incredible things. In October of 1956, NICAP had been incorporated in the District of Columbia. NICAP was the National Investigations Comm ittee on Aerial Phenom enon. It was headed by Major Donald E. Keyhoe. It was an im pressive group which in cluded Major D ewey Fournet who was m entioned repeatedly in Ruppelt' s book and who was a m ember of NICAP' s Board of Governors! Major Fournet was also Headquarters Project Monitor for Project Blue Book and he had conducted the famous m otion studies showing th at UFOs were intelligen tly c ontrolled devices. Indiana' s own, Frank Edwards, a well known radio and TV announ cer who wrote several books on UFOs, was also a m ember of NICAP' s Board of Governors. Th e very first CIA Direct or, Vice Ad miral R.H. Hillenkoetter, USN, was also a m ember of the bo ard. The NICAP Public Inform ation website is located at: http://www.nicap.org/ 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"In 1960 I was living in V incennes, Indiana wh ere we had a local UFO study group called CRUFO, Civilian Research Unidentified Fly ing Objects, for a couple of years. I also join ed NICAP because many of the people with who Ruppelt worked were invo lved in it. Ruppelt him self wa s not involved because be could not officially wo rk with NICAP since he was still a reserve Air Force officer in th e Air Force R eserve. On Nove mber 17, 1960, the best peo ple we had in the CRUFO study gro up becam e a NICAP subcomm ittee called Indiana Unit N o. 1. There were about twenty such team s in the country and I was the subcomm ittee chairm an of Indiana Unit No. 1. Besides m e, there were several young m en who were the crux of our group. Jim Catt was our m ain transportati on source and head of communications. Jim and I both had mobile and base CB radios. Phillip Studl er was in charg e of public relations. Phil and his brother had a hom e photo lab. Our group was also a civil defense radiological monitoring squad and we had a com plete set of radiation detection equipm ent. Anot her member was Jerry Sievers who w ould later attain the rank of NI CAP Assistant State Director. Besides the four m an field inves tigation team we had three scient ific advisors; one of which had worked on Project Saucer b ack in the late 1940s. Our NICAP group worked together for about ten years before I relocate d out of Vincennes. Before I left, our group investigated a good many UFO r eports. In those days there were no real territories. We went wherever we had to go to do our investigations. Som e critics allude to the glam our of UFO investigations work. It isn' t glam orous. M ost UFOs turn out to be IFOs and a great deal of tim e and money is expended investigating false alarm s. Most of those th at are UFOs are distan t light s or other objects. In the early days UFO buffs s uch as we were a m inority and m any people thought that we were deluded. As Rodney Dange rfield would say, \"We didn' t get no respect!\" in those days. I have intentionally skipped over m ost of the inves tigations work in order to present only the m ost im portant cases. This will give the impression that UFO activity was rare for us. It wasn' t at all rare. However, it was nothing in the sixties like what it would becom e in the la ter y ears. Please bear with m e concerning som e cases only briefly m entioned in this book. The fact that they were close encounter objects with in 500 feet of the witnesses is im portant enough to include them here. These cases turned up in th e databases but there wasn' t enough inform ation to present them in more detail. In m y opinion, there inclusion in the com puter database is relevant. The illu strations pres ented in th is re port ar e rem arkable. Som e are original witne ss s ketches, bu t most were redrawn from the original sketches by my able staff artist, Robert Taylor. The rendition of the Trindade Island com puter enhancem ent of the original photo on page 38 is m y own. My thanks go out to all those who have worked with m e all these years beginning with CRUFO, then NICAP, and later, MUFON. A special thanks m ust go out to those w ho pioneered the path for us in the early years. To nam e just a few of these early pathfinders: Frank Edwards, Edward Ruppelt, Donald Keyhoe, and Lan Spri ngfield. Justly deserved cred it for their contributions are given throughout this book. This book is especially dedicated to a pioneer and co mrade right here in Indian a: Jim Catt. Jim was one of the first Field Investigators in the In diana Group.

All were distant encounters, mysterious lights in the sky, et c. Nothing really exciting was happening. At least nothing exciting was being reported to us. In contrast, 1960 was, however, inte resting for a lot of reasons. August 1960: Som ebody else was in orbit and that \"som ebody\" wasn' t us or the Russians. The 100 foot diam eter, silvered m ylar balloon, nam ed Echo, t hat NASA had put into orbit to reflect radio waves was a reason for a lot of people to look up. W hen they did look up, they started seeing things that were not supposed to be there. An unidentified satellite was tracked by Grum ann Aviation in August 1960. A photograph of it appeared in Life Magazine. Our sate llites a re launched to wards the w est nea r th e equator in order to take advantage of the Earth' s rotational speed, about 1,000 m iles per hour at the equator, to help our rockets achieve orbital velocity of around 18,000 m iles per hour. The unident ified satellite w as trave ling in a retrograd e orbit m eanin g that it wa s moving east to west inst ead of west to east the way all s atellites laun ched up to that ti me m oved. On August 30th at 11:00 PM and again on August 31st, a m oon watch team in Chicago along with m any other witnesses observed the m ystery satellite. (R ef. 1) July 22, 1960: Even before the m ysterious satellite was spotted som e interesting activity occurred which turned up years later when I completed the regional database. On July 22nd there had been a CE2 at Martin, Tennessee. CE m eans Close Encounter and the 2 indicates that the UFO left a record of its visit. Us ually a CE2 sighting m eans that there is a landing trace or an electrom agnetic effect on an autom obile. (Ref. 2) Beginning in Nove mber 1960, there were a few stra nge fireball reports that we investigated. These reports can' t, by any stretch of the im agina tion, be called close enc ounters. Still, these sighting s were in terestin g because th eir was an elem ent of strangeness in them that makes them worthy of m ention. November 17, 1960: On Nove mber 17, 1960, our NICAP UFO Subcomm ittee Team was authorized to conduct investig ations of this phenom enon. Th e action, however, started on Nove mber 14th. Quoting the newspaper article f rom that time: \"RED F LASH SEEN I N SKY MUST HAVE BEEN A M ETEOR Th at brilliant red flash seen over Vincenne s and southern Indiana and adjoining areas Monday night m ust have been a m eteor.

O n Decem ber 1st I r eceived a letter fro m Battery C, 5th Miss ile Battalion, 56th Artillery, at Dillsboro, Indiana. The letter w as in response to a request I had made regarding their public report of a rada r track. The Executive Officer, 2nd Lt. Charles A. Millick, s tated : \"W e were not rad ar tr acking an unidentified flying object on Monday, 14 Nove mber 1960. Therefore, we m ust subm it a negative report .\" (Ref. 3) November 29, 1960: Before we got that letter, we had a UFO sighting of our own. On Nove mber 29th at 8:00 PM, the phone rang. Phil Studler, one our team m embers who lived in town, had gotten a phone call that a bright UF O was heading in m y direction. At this tim e I lived with my parents in their hom e located outside of town on a hill southeast of Vincennes. I imm ediately cont acted another UF O enthusiast, Ji m Eddlem an, and his brother, Paul, who lived nearby. W e all watched this br ight object as it pulsa ted and traveled across the sky without any sound. I was lucky enough to have m y mother and father, m y brother Steve, and my sister Sherrie. W hile watching the object with binocular s I told Steve to call Jim Catt, another team m ember. The object was th en in the east and trav eling from north to south. It ev entually swu ng to the so utheas t, ceas ed pulsating, and becam e very brigh t. The moon, that night, was full and the object had banked and was re flecting the bright moonlight. There had been a sm all red light n ear the m ain UFO but not connected to it. Shortly, we were all startled by a rumble which cam e from behind us and, as we turned to look. we saw a jet in hot pursuit of the m ain object. W ithin 15 seconds the m ain object faded com pletely out, however the sm all red object re mained in view for 10-15 m ore m inutes. Apparently the pilo t of the jet wasn' t concer ned with sm all red object because he did not pursue it. Possibly, he did not see the red object at all. The bright UFO was in view a total of about 10 m inutes before the je t cam e in to view. (Ref. 3) 1961 May 1961: During the first week of May 1961, persons at Union Mills in northern Indiana had a CE1 UFO sighting. A he mispherical UFO with \"portholes\" was actually on the road and took off as a car approached. This sighti ng w asn' t one of our case investigations but it was the beginning of important UFO activities. (Ref. 4) Another strange object was reporte d near LaPorte near Chicago. It was hat shaped and m ade a sound like an \"eggbeater\". Th e exact date of this sighti ng are not given in the source material.

It was a CE1 si ghting and it occurred at Waukegan, Illinois. (Ref. 7) June 21, 1963: A CE2 sighting at Hillsid e, I llino is, f ollowed on June 21st. The identif icatio n on this s ighting is a \"possible aircraft\". (Ref. 7) July 10, 1963: On the afternoon of July 10th four boys in Fern Creek, Kentucky had a rare CE3 sighting. They saw a cigar shaped obj ect which discharged a sm all disc which subsequently landed. A m oment later a sm all en tity with a la rge head, tig ht f itting clo thes, and tubes like a respirator was seen. Two of the four boys received wounds from a black tube pointed at them by the entity. T his was before all publicity concerning alien appearan ce. (Ref. 10) August 4, 1963: The big event of 1963 occurred on th e Sunday evening of August 4th at about 11:30 PM at W ayne City, Illino is. W ayne City is a little out of our territo ry being about 75 m iles away and out of state but we had to respond because there wasn' t an FI anywhere near there and it was to importan t a si ghting to b e neglected. Because of ou r jobs, we had to delay until the weekend before we could respond. By the following Saturday evening we were on our way to W ayne City. Accom panying m e on this investigation were Jim Catt and Phil Studler. Phil had earlier co ntacted the news m edia and the W ayne County Sherif f's Office and a rra nged an inte rview. W e interv iewed the witnesse s to the c ase there in Fairfield, Illinois, and then m ade a trip to the hom e of other witne sses in ru ral Keenes, Illinois, nearby. By that tim e it was getting la te in the day. Here is what we found: A week earlier a young m an, Ronnie Austin, and his girlfriend had left a drive-in theater at 11:30 PM and headed east on Highway 15 towards the girlfriend' s hom e. They noticed a big, white ball of light towards the southwest th at was following them at treetop level. The light speeded up and slowed down to m atch their every m ove. It then changed position to the south of them and then crossed over in front of them to the north side. At a point six m iles west of the Orchardville Road in tersection, the light headed f or the car. It appeared to get within a few hundred feet of the car and then suddenly gained al titude and stopped for 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"several seconds over an electroni c relay tower. T he ligh t then shot acro ss the road to the north or left side of their car and m aintained this position at about 500 feet distance for som e period of tim e. The couple then turned north on to a gravel ro ad which led to the girl' s hom e about 1 1/2 miles away. The object was now on their right. When they arrived at the girl' s hom e the girlfriend' s sister also saw the object which was now towards the southeast. The object appeared to move closer as al l three went inside, turned out the lights, and watched through a window. After 15 m inutes the boy decided that he should go hom e and made a run for the car. The object began to \"stalk\" the boy. He had to head south to get hom e. The object was now on his left. W hen he turned east onto a nother gravel road the object suddenly shot diagonally ahead of him and stopped above a ba rn about a m ile away just beyond the \"T\" road. The light changed from a brilliant white to a duller or dimm er light with an orange tinge. He really \"poured the coal\" to the car and m ust have been doing 120 m iles per hour when he topped the h ill on the gravel road. Th en, the obj ect flared a b right orange and cam e straight toward him at high speed. It then hovered within about 100 feet of the car. Just before it began to hover it had swerved upward so that th e boy got a closer look at it. He judged its size at about that of an autom obile. When the object was directly over the boy' s car his AM radio went crazy with static which he descri bed as a loud \"whining sound\". He also felt a \"cooling effect\". The object m ade another pass at the car ; th is tim e f rom west to eas t. Again, at the po int where the o bject was d irectly overhead of the car, the car eng ine started \"m issing\". The object then proceed ed back to the position over the b arn where it h overed and its color changed to a dull orange. The boy now turned north at the road intersec tion and headed for hom e which was over three miles away. The object again follow ed him . As he headed w est down the lane toward his hom e, the object cut across the road behind him to the left. H e spun the car around in the driveway in front of the house, got out, and ran inside. The object was now above another far mhouse in the east about 300 yards away. His arrival had awakened his parents and they thought he had gone crazy. He could barely talk. Every other word would \"trail off\". The boy' s father took a look at the object and determ ined that the shotgun near the door wa s no m atch for what had scared his son. He tried to call the Fairfield Poli ce Departm ent which really scared all of them because the phone was \"dead\". They finally determ ined that their young son was in need of m edical attention and that they had to contact a doctor. B y then, the phone was in working order. In all there were seven witn esses including the boy' s mothe r and father and sister and brother. The total sighting tim e was 50 m inutes. This unknown is listed as a CE2 with electrom agnetic effects on the car radio, car engine, speedom eter, and telephone. The car was a 1956 Ford Victoria which was equipped with a m agnetic speedom eter which probably gave false readings due to electrom agnetic effects from the UFO. This case w as investigated by our NICAP Subc ommittee and a team of Air Force P roject Blue Book physicists. E vidence ga thered by the Air For ce indicates that the car was slightly radioactive or m agnetized. This was determ ined by the type of readings given by m embers of the Air Force team as they insp ected th e car while the fam ily watched and listened. 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"As an interesting histo rical note for the reco rd, the Air Force team of investigators consisted of three m en: Lt. Col. Robert J. Friend, then Director of Project Bl ue Book; Capt. Hector Quintanilla; and Sgt. Charles R. Sharp. Eith er later in 1963 or in early 1964, Quintanilla becam e the Project Director of Project Blue Boo k. At this tim e the Air Force in general, and Ca pt. Quintan illa in part icular, were ridiculing many witnesses who claim ed sighti ngs of UFOs. In keeping with this philosophy the official Blue Book \"explanation\" of this sighting which wa s issued after this i nvestigation was that it was either \"a refueling o perati on\" or \"the planet Venus\". In contrast, the Air Force must have consid ered th is case im portant because th ey had flown in a spec ial team of phys icists from W right-Patterson A FB, Dayton, Ohio. No rm ally, when investigating a case, they would send the local \"UFO Officer\" from the n earest Air Force base. Apparently the Air Force thoug ht that som ething strang e was going on in the m idwest becau se Air Force Inte llig ence was inter ested in som ething tha t officially did no t exis t. A quick check would have elim inated a refueling ope ration as a possible explanati on and, consequently, the need to m ake an onsite inspection. (Ref. 3) August 7, 1963: On August 7th at 8:45 PM in F airfiel d, Illinois, about 20 m iles northeast of Wayne City and Keenes, Chauncy Uphoff and M ike Hill had their attentio n attracted to a light in the sky when Uphoff' s dog began ba rking. Looking up, they saw a yellow orange, diam ond shaped object traveling west to east at an altitude of a thousand feet or m ore. The object later turned a dull gray colo r. The UF O made a sharp turn at high speed and headed north directly toward the observers while changi ng color to orange and, finally, to a brilliant blue white. At its closest approach which was right in front of the witne sses, they sa id tha t it loo ked som ewhat like \"a ball diam ond turned sideways\". \"It had depth to it\", said Uphoff. The object m ade a U-turn, tilting on edge, and turned southeast toward Gra yville. After hovering briefly, the UFO took off at a 45 degree angle. T he \"ball diamond\" description at all viewing angles sugg ests a sh ape sim ilar to th at shown in Exhibit 1a. Because of the barking d og, this case is also classed as an an im al reaction case. (Ref. 3) Exhibit 1a When the object started the U-tu rn it tilted on edge exhibiting a tail like projection on the bottom . The witnesses described the projection as like \"a fluid drippi ng\" rather than an actual part of the object. W e considered this as evidence of corona discharge.

The newspaper account said that there were a total of 26 witn esses but no one would file a report. (Ref. 3) There were a large number of UFOs reported in the summ er of 1963. Many reports were filed; others were not. I ha ve purposely excluded distant enco unters in ord er to con cen trate attention on the m ore succinct sight ings. In spite of the high num ber of total sightings in the Illinois area, 1963 was not, however, considered a \"flap\" year. \"Fla ps\" are waves of UFO sightings that generally cover, as a m inim um, a large part of the United States. The 1963 \"m iniflap\" was actually a concentration of sightings in southern Illinois. August 16, 1963: Even more eerie is the fact that the earth satellite nam ed Anna Firefly, which had been out for two m onths, suddenly cam e back to life. On August 16th, Richard B. Kershner of the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins laboratory who developed the satellite said , \"W e don' t like to believ e in sp ace grem lins, but we' ve reached the poin t where that' s as good an explana tion as any.\" (Ref. 1) September 1963: In Septem ber I was contacted by an Air Force reserve group, the 1127th Air Reserve Squadron, requesting m e to gi ve a briefing on UFOs. The briefing was scheduled to be given at the Robert Green Auditorium in Vincennes, Indiana, on August 16th. I was flattered and thought th at the briefing was requested due to th e recen t increase in UFO activity in the region. However, in the last few years researchers turned up an official docum ent concerning crashed UFOs and a secret project called \"Operation Moon Dust\". This document stated th at retrieval o f downed space objects, includ ing UFOs, was the responsib ility of a special unit at For Belvoir; the 4602nd. The 4602nd becam e the 1006th AISS in July 1957. In April 1960 the 1006th AISS becam e the 1127th USAF Activities Group of which the 1127th Air Reserve Squadr on, the unit which had requested the UFO briefing, was a subordinate unit! Project Blue Book was a sham organization whic h fronted for another \"special group\" which actually had prim ary responsibility for investigating good UFO repor ts. It' s interesting that this special group was interested in our investigati ons. (Ref. 11) 1964 By now, Ca ptain, now Major, Quin tanilla had re placed L t. Col. Friend as Project Blue Book Directo r, the drive for co ngression al UFO h earings had failed, and the Air Force was explaining away all UFO sighting reports at all costs. Thes e were the d ark ages of UFO investigation and NICAP was alm ost forced to disband. Then, som ething awesom e happened at Socorro, New Mexico. April 24, 1964: A CE3 sighting, one of the highest ra ted cases on record, occurred at 5:45 AM (Mountain Standard Tim e) on April 24th, ne ar Socorro, New Mexico. I recall receiving a call from David Goodnow, then an announcer fo r radio station W AOV in Vincennes. Mr. 14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Goodnow is now a fa mous television anchorm an for CNN. He had a teletype m essage that had just come in over the news ticker and he wanted m e to com e down and get it. (Exhibit 2a) An egg shaped object had landed in New Mexico and then taken off. Hum anoid beings were seen near the craft and they had gotten back ab oard before the object took off. The witness to all this was a police officer. (Exhibit 3a) June 8, 1964: On June 8th at 9:30 PM in Lawrencevil le, Illinois, which is just across the river from Vincennes, a CE1 si ghting took place. The witness, Mrs. Helen Reed, described a close-up observation she had of a peculiar looking object which was in the vicinity of her barn and in the air not more than 10 or 15 feet high. It was a typical dom ed disc with a flat 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"bottom . W hen she first observed it the dom e was glowing a soft blue. T he object then moved erratically away from the barn and the dom e turned a bright red orange in color. It then execu ted several sh arp righ t ang le turns and disappeared behind her shed. Walking over to a position between her barn and shed, Mrs. Reed saw the objec t app roach at a m oderate speed and then stop within 50 feet of her. She estim ated that the object was no more than 15 feet in diam eter and she late r described a series of round, yellow lights that encir cled th e base. She said th at th ese ligh ts were \"brighter than headlights\" but caused her no discom fort as she observed them . The lights then began to rotate from left to right and Mrs. Reed noti ced th at there was one space where a ligh t appeared to b e missing. (E xhibit 4 a) The object hov ered in the sam e position for several seconds with the speed of the revolution of the lights increasing to a high RPM. The object then began to m ove away; m aking a sharp, right angl e turn to the n orth and, without gaining altitude, it disappeared from view. Mrs. Reed sa id that as the object departed, its yellow lights were rotating so rapi dly that it gav e the appe arance of a sin gle band around the object' s base. This entire seque nce of events lasted, perhaps, 10 m inutes. (Ref. 12) Although they seem ed slightly silly at the tim e, reports of sm all, ba sketball sized objects were not uncommon. I refer to these objects as OBOLs (Or ange Balls of Light). They generally appear near the ground; som etimes near fence rows, house windows, etc. I believe that these are probes with TV cam eras not unl ike the ones on our own spacecraft su ch as the Viking, etc. There correlation with parent objects is docum ented. They are not unlike the little red light in the m ovie \"Close E ncounter s of the Third K ind\". Such an object is apparen tly what appeared at Dale, Indiana. June 24, 1964: Dale, Indiana is about 45 m iles southeast of Vincennes, Indiana. A Spencer County youth told police that on June 24th at 9:00 PM he was held frozen in his tracks as he watched a glowing object cavort in his backyard and then strea k away. Puzzled au thorities found a burned spot about the size of a dinner plate in the grass. They said that they had no idea what th e object m ight have been . Charles Eng lebrecht, 18, said th at he was al one in his darkened hom e watching television when a bright flash of light beside a window attracted his attention. Englebrecht said the television and the lights in an adjoining room blacked out. Englebrecht said that the object was already on the ground near the back steps when he went outside. He said that \"som e strange power\" kept him away from it. He noticed that a nearby chicken feeder trough was overturned, a large can of chicken feed hand been knocked from a 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"table, and the fa mily power m ower was ten feet away from where he ha d lef t it ear lier. \"I was num b\", he said. \"I didn' t know what to do.\" The boy said that, as he watched unable to move, \"it be gan to r ise a nd then dis appeared ove r the ba rn\". A sm ell of sulf ur f illed the air, he said. The Dale Town Marshall, Leroy Musgrave, said he phoned state police asking about any other reports of this incident but no other reports were received. Englebrecht told Jim , Phil, and I that the obj ect was sharply defined, self lum inous, that the actual size approxim ated that of a basketball, and that it landed on the ground right next to him . After about 5 m inutes the object took o ff over the barn which was about 40 feet away with a whistling sound and disappear out of si ght. The object changed color from a bright red to a bluish purple to white to a brighter red on departure. He was in near shock an d he exper ienced a loss of appetite a nd lost cons iderable bod y weight during the two week period imm ediately following the sighting. William T. Powers, the Chief System s Engineer at Dearbo rn Observator y, investigated the case for Project Blue Book. He stated that he thought the boy m ay have seen only a burning piece of pap er. I do not have the date that h e vis ited with Eng lebrecht but is prio r to o ur investigation. I never heard th e resu lt of the f inal analy sis by the Air Force. Possibly, CUFOS has a record of it since Dr. Hynek and Mr . Powers were associates. This sighting is listed as UNKNOWN, C E2, possi ble probe. (Ref. 3) June 28, 1964: Four nights later three girls were chased by a white ball of light. This sighting was classed as a CE1, also occurred at Dale, Ind iana, and it happ ened in th e wee hours of the morning. Fifteen m inutes after m idnight to be exact. The five-m inute event frightened the three girls. Jim Catt, Joetta Fields, Carolyn Roach, and m yself investigated. We had visited the Englebrecht boy and he took us to see the witnesses. I think the presence of the wom en in our group eased the tension of the young girls during our interview of them . They turned out to be very credible w itnesses. (Ref 3) Interestingly , there was a news clipp ing about a UFO trace case near Rom e, Indiana, that appeared in the Indianapolis Star on the 28 th of June titled \" Mysterious Markings in Field Baffle Perry County Farm Family. \" The article s tated : \"A sp aces hip land ing or freak act of nature could be responsible fo r the mysterious m arkings found in an alf alfa field on Germ an Ridge. The m arkings were found in the field n ear Rom e in southern Perry County yesterday afternoon on the farm of Mr. & Mrs. Jam es E. St owe.

By the tim e things started getting interesti ng during the summ er of 1964, Jim and I and six other m embers of our reserve unit got orders to report for active TDY (Tem porary Duty) with the U.S. Ar my.

A fe w nocturnal light sightings in Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, and Missouri also marked the beginning of the wave. The 1967 wave wasn' t apparent until we reviewed the sightings database in 1992. At the tim e that the wave began, I was still living in Vincennes, Indiana, with m y wife of one year. The w ave began w ith a close encounter near hom e. 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"January 10, 1967: This sighting occurred at 8:30 PM in Bruceville, Indiana; just five m iles northeast of our hom e in Vincennes. A lady and her sixteen year old son were driving down the lane leading to their cabin when they observed an unusual object. The obj ect was dull gray, elliptical in shape, and glowing a sort of bluish color around its rim . It was in the air about 25 feet above the car. Higher than than a nearby light pole. It appeared to be about th irty f eet in diam eter and about eight feet thick. It hovered for a few seconds; then accelerated slowly at f irst, then fast toward the southeast. It vanished from view in six to eight seconds. As the object banked slightly it exhibited a disc shape and several dim light s under its rim . (Ref 1) January 15, 1967: A CE2 sighting involving an elongate d object occurred at 9:00 P M in Shelbyville, Kentucky. (Ref 2) January 17, 1967: Francis Bedel, Jr., age 23, of Portla nd, Indiana was driving on State Highway 135, a two lane, blacktop road. Nort h of Freetown, 15 m iles north of Colum bus, he later reported to Indiana S tate Police that a brilliant, g lowing white ligh t dar ted in to his field of view. It apparently hovered over the road for a few seconds; then slowly reversed its course. Bedel was so engrossed with the sp ectac le tha t he lost contro l of his ve hicle which left the road and was badly dam aged. On the sam e stretch of road on the sam e night, Mr. and Mrs. Phil Patton of Freetown, Indiana, reported to s tate po lice that a brightly lit, d isc sh aped craft cam e down alongside th eir car. M r. Patton told State Trooper Conrad th at the object m oved along the highw ay directly in front of their car and about a hundred f eet ahead of it. They estim ated that the object was about 100 feet above the road and they described it as circular in sh ape and about the size of a sm all house. (Ref 3) January 19, 1967: A CE2 sighting occurred where the witn ess m anaged to tape a photograph. If the photograph actually shows a humanoid' s above the craft, the si ghting would be classed as a CE 3; however, I have not been able to confirm this. The witness, 15 year old R eed Thom pson, com pleted and forwarded a signed questionn aire but subm itted no photo graph or neg ative. Twen ty years later I learned that Don W orley had also conducte d an investigation of this sighting. At about 3:00 PM the witness said he heard a ru mbling sound like a train. Wh en the noise persisted the boy said that he went to the window and wa s startled to see a shiny object which w as m oving slowly abou t 25 feet abo ve the groun d. The objec t was described as a s ilver, quilted surface object in the shape of a six feet by ei ght feet jar with a top opening. It followed the ground contour and made angled turns around trees. Grabbing a sm all, plastic cam era, the witness snap ped several pictures. He got one good photograph of the object through the bedroom wi ndow. The object disappeared instantly when it was near a pine tree. According to the witness the photog raph is very dark becau se of the brig ht sun reflecting on th e silvery object but the photo does sh ow the tree limb reflections on both sides of the object. In the top of the object is what a ppears to be a faint shadow. The photo n egativ es were sent to the Condon Committee Colorado UFO Study. The total tim e of observation wa s about seven m inutes.

Som etim es it pulsated. Trooper Chastain never heard a sound from the object during the thirty m inute observation. The obj ect finally disappeared behind a tree line in the southwest. The range to the object was es tim ated to be five m iles. (Ref 1) Eight m iles west of Browntown, Indiana, Trooper Blev ins followed the object for fifteen m inutes to Lawrence County, Indiana. The object was reported by Trooper Blevins to be \"softball sized\" and changing colors from blue to green to white. \"It wa s stationary when I first saw it,\" he said, \"but it was to big to be a star. Suddenly, it started to m ove.\" The object flickere d and wobbled as it went from southwest of his position to due south during the fifteen m inut es that he saw the object. The object then dropped straight down behind a tree line and disappeare d. Trooper Blevins observed the object through binoculars at least once during the sighting. The estim ated range to the object was 2- 10 m iles. (R ef 1) February 5, 1967: At 1:45 AM a sighting of a \"boom erang\" near Oakland City, Indiana was reported.

It wa s about 7:50 P M as Trooper Swider was patrolling Interstate 65 near Ind iana State Patro l (ISP) H eadquarters (H Q) when ISP HQ advised him of a UFO that had been reported to them . He, him self, saw the object in the west for about ten m inutes before it finally went out of sight. He described the ob ject as a huge, round object m oving slowly left to right and changing colors from white to red to orange. The colors changed as the m ovem ent of the object slowed and then accelerate d. This was not a sighting o f th e planet Venus because Venus was visible at the sam e time.

Orange in color and oval shaped, it had a light in the center and a ring of red lights circling the m iddle. Yellow light sources near the base of the object were separated by br ight m etal. The whole object glowed with the brightness of the m oon but the red lights around th e m iddle of the object were extremely bright. Both wom en were frightened. The prim ary witn ess, the m other, opened the window for a better view and, at that instant, the objec t rose at an angle toward the eas t and leveled off at about thirty feet above the field. It then m oved s outh for about a half m ile and then w est along a railroad track before disappearing behind the trees in the distance. There w as no sound. Because of rain and m ud, the wom en did not check the landing site un til March 23rd.

R ichard Hall of NICAP detected this be fore I was aware of it because he w as receiving sighting reports from all over and it was apparent to him that the concentrati on of sightings at this time was in my area. My RSID listings compile d in the early 1990s confirmed our suspicions.

As he turned into the lane that lead to his house he noticed a strangely lighted craft in the sky. It was m ovi ng slowly to the south cr ossing som e fields behind his house at an altitude he estim ated to be about one thousand feet. The thing that attracted his atten tion wa s the lightin g a rrangem ent of the object. The object had a b rilliant white light in f ront, a rapidly blinking red light at the re ar, and pulsating red light s underneath from front to back of what appeared to be a cigar sh aped craft. Reaching his house, the pilot phon ed the airport c ontrol tower and asked if they had an ything on their radar scope in his area. The radar m an assure d him that they did indeed have an unidentified object on the scope and they had been watching it for several m inutes. The pilot inquired if either of the Goodyear blimps were airborne? The radar m an replied that neither were airborne and that he could clearly see bot h blimps tied down at the airport only a few hundred yards from his position. A nd, he added , th ere were no planes an d no weather balloons in that area. The pilot n ext called th e Marion Cou nty Sherif f's Of fice and that office broadcast an alert on their radios. The dispatcher at the sheriff' s office contac ted th e rada r room at the airpo rt and was told th at they were w atching an unidentified radar return on the scope of an object m oving about at a very low altitude in the area indicated. Two deputies who answered the the radio broadcast were in the general area of the pilot' s house and they were d ispatched to the scene to check the report. The first to reach the scene wa s Deputy Kenneth Toler who told the FI: \"It was a sight; a very strange sight. The light on the front end was brilliant. W e (the deputy and the pilot) could see the shape of the thing, like a fat cigar about forty to fifty feet long, we estim ated. It was m oving slowly against the wind. The row of lights along the bottom was unusual. I never saw a craf t with lights lik e tha t. \"W e watched the thing for about 25 minutes altogether. It w as som ewhe re beyond a m ile from us .

I had been to Elberfeld, Indiana, with my oldest son to visit m y youngest sister and we were on our way hom e and talking about religion with nothing on our m inds besides the topic, when I glanced up and saw the UFO. W e had just ente red the c ity lim its past th e airport and turned right on a side road towards town, when I suddenly saw an odd sight in the sky on m y right. The day was very warm and the car window was open, so I saw the object very clearly. The day had been as clear as a crystal with warm sunlight and I could see every detail of th e UFO. At first I thought it was an advertising gimm ick. It was in the sky, not m ovi ng, and had it been m ore rounded and stream lined, I m ight have though it was a blimp or the like, but it was long-shaped, darkish in co lor, and definitely not stream lined. The object did not appe ar to be tall enough in height to hold an upright m an, and if a hum an being was inside he would ha ve very likely had to be sitting, at least to fit into the flat- looking shape. The object was long, however, about the length of an airplane, and it looked very old, very heavy m etal, a dull brown, with sm udges that appeared to have been m ade by great heat or the like. It was a lead color, with smudge s as it it had been on fire at one tim e. \"It was very ugly, and the thing did not seem to have windows, but along both the top and bottom there was a row of squares set waffle-like back in to the m etal, and along between the squares was a band, running from one end to the other. On the side to m y right was, what I took to be, the nose of the thing, although it could have been the other en d, I don' t know, anyway, it was blunt like that of an old m ode l \"T\" car, with step-l ike projections around it. (E xhibit 6B) \"I did not pay as m uch attention to the other end, but I think it wa s not stream lined, either, so I' ll illus trate it a s best I can, but I'm not as sure abou t it. 36"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"\"It had no visible m eans of locom otion, and m ade no sound. It did not have wings, or a rotor on it, or fum es that I could see com ing from it, and it just hung in the sky without m oving. It was beyond som e trees, above them , and over a railroad tr ack, and there were no hom es close by. Although, on down the road further, there wa s som e mobile hom es and a house or tw o. These likely could not have seen the thing, as there were trees to cut off their view. \"I felt irritated at it, as it did not m ove, and I couldn' t figure out what it was, so I asked m y son, 'what in the world is that? ' He said, \"I can' t see it, Mother, wait until I can pullover, and I' ll get out and see.' W e we re rounding a turn in the road by then and I was looking b ack at it, and the trees then hid it. He stopped and offered to walk back and l ook, but I was anxious to get hom e, m y feet were hurting, so I told him to let it go. Later I wished I had gone back with him and had used m y ca mera which was loaded and o n the seat between us. I never even though of the cam era, til I got hom e.\" When she got hom e she told her husband about the si ghting. He told her to call the airport and she did. The people contacted at th e airport had no explanation so she called a radio station, a newspaper, and, last, a local TV station. The TV station people said that they didn' t doubt that she might have seen som ething because there had been calls on th e previous n ight. The witness appears to be a religio us person. In f act, she and her son were discussing religion when the incident occurred. Her son did not see the object . Her description in the letter of the duration of the sighting was \"6 m inutes\". Duri ng a subsequent telephone intervie w she stated that this duration was to long and that it w as closer to a m inute. This revised durati on is in her favor and shows her dedication to the truth and accuracy. Her estim ate of distance and altitude are lacki ng because sh e states that sh e knows she couldn' t accurately judge them . This is also in her favor. Escalation of Hypothesis is one of the scientifically interesting aspects of good UFO s ightings. Under this sighting aspect the witness doesn' t first try to m ake the obje ct a UFO. The witness f irst tries to com e up with a logical explanation for the even t. In this case, the w itness spen t the f irst pa rt of that m inute that she says she had the object in sight, thinking about it being an advertising gimm ick such as a blimp. There was a loaded cam era on the seat beside her. She was so caught up in the sighting that she never though to use it. The m eticulous detail provided by the witness in dicates clo se proxim ity to the object at som e point even though she would not hazard a guess as to proxi mity other than one-quarter to one-half m ile. Because of the unsureness of the distance between the witnes s and th e ob ject, I could not class th is as a Close E ncounter. Her son did not see the o bject b ecause by the time she decided that it was som ething unusual, it was lost to v iew. No other witness es to th is even have com e forward. (Ref 7) September 30, 1968: At about 1:00 AM there w as a sightin g by five witnesses from an aircraft flying near Louisville, Kentucky. The commercial pilot, Dodgie Stockm ar, and four passengers reported reported seeing a light sour ce above them with two to three beam s of light shining towards the ground. One light beam was longer than the others and they pulsated. The light source, at first, seem ed like a star but then it be gan moving west, dropped to the plan e's altitude, and then descended into a restricted area near the L ouisville airport and went out. 37"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"October 26, 1968: At approxim ately 10:00 PM Mr. and Mr s.

W hen they reached the landing site o n the road th e car lights went out for half a m inute or m ore as they re ached each land ing location. (Ref 8) Fall, 1968: On an unknown date in the Fall of 1968 at about 7:30 PM a sighting occurred at Aurora, Illinois. There are four adult wi tnes ses to th is s ighting: Mr. and Mrs. Roy W iakur, Mr. Everett Percell, and Mr. Bill S chinke. Accor ding to th e witnesses a shiny sauce r shaped obje ct with a spinning outer rim m ade a very loud noise like \"50 steel rakes being scrapped over concrete.\" The object was estim ated to be 45-50 fe et in diam eter and between 200 and 1,000 feet in altitude. The object was first seen in the east and then it m oved west over the Aurora Country Club. The spinning rim see m to change direction several tim es. Sl owing down or speeding up the spin rate can produce this effect by strobe action sim ilar to the way stagecoach wh eels seem to change direction in old western m ovies. After thirty m inutes of observa tion by the w itnesses the obj ect m oved straight up and was gone in seconds. (Ref 8) 1968 was a year etched forever in m y m emory and in the m emory of m illions around the world. It was the year that a Christm as m essage was broadcas t to the w orld by th e thr ee m an crew of Apollo 8 as they orb ited the m oon f or the f irst tim e. 1969 On January 9, 1969 the Condon Report of the Univer sity of Colorado UFO study was publicly released. N ICAP disputed the conclusions of the study at a press conference held at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., on J anuary 11th. In May, the Mutual UF O Netw ork (MUFON) formed under the or iginal name of Midwest UFO Network. The organization incorporated the publication, Skylook . On December 17th, Secretary o f the Air Force R obert C. Sea mans, Jr., announced th e termina tio n of Project B lue Book. Based on the Condon Report and its endorsement by the National Academy of Sciences, he said continuance of the project \"cannot be justified either on the grounds of national security or in the in teres t of science. \" Later, we discover ed the \"Bolender Memo\" tha t revea led th at UFO sightings that in volve nationa l security were never part of the Pro ject Blue Book system. Investigations of UFO sightings by the Air Force c ontinued. Twenty plus yea rs la ter we discovered that there w as a special group that w as responsible for investigating the g ood cases and that this group was watching us, too. 1970 Interest in UFOs dropped off rapidly when witnesses were told that officially UFOs didn't exist. T he release of the Condon Report and pub lic, official discontinuance of Project Blue Book caused a reluctance by witnesses to report UFO sightings and resulted in a dearth of sightings during this period. With the birth of MUFON in 1969 there were now three major UFO reporting organizations; NICAP, APRO, and MUFON. As thes e grass roots organizations grew in size the number and quality of U FO sightings began to improve. All that was needed was for witnesses to see something and know where to report their sighti ng. I was still a NIC AP Field Investigator and NICAP Subcommittee Ch airman in 1 970. 38"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"August 30, 1970: The first interesting case th at I investigated this year involved three witnesses; a man, his wife, and his daughter. It occurred east of Vincennes, Indiana in a housing subdivision about 11:00 AM on August 30th. Th e prim ary witne ss who we will refer to as Mr. W , a good frien d and neighbor of m y brother, Steven, was at hom e in the process of loading film into his cam era to be taken on a trip. He was interrup ted b y his daught er who claim ed she saw a m etallic, disc shaped craft. Mr. W, along with his wife, followed thei r daughter back outside a nd saw the object. Mr. W then reentered the house to retrieve his 7x50 binocula rs. W hen he returned the object was closer. Mr. W described it as lik e a garbag e can lid with a piece of waterm elon on top. It was hovering o ver Wheatland Road. (See the Reed Ca se, exhib it 1 A) The witnesses es tim ated th at th e object was approxim ately thirty f eet in diam eter. They were positiv e tha t others m ust have seen it because it was so low in altitude. T he object suddenly dived a nd arced out of sight behind a tre eline. It was in the sight of the witnesses for about one and one-h alf m inutes at a distance estim ated to be one- quarter m ile. (Ref 7) I decided that an early warning de tection system for UFOs would be helpful as a way to obtain better data on UFOs than we were getting from w itness observations. With the help of a local scien tist, Louis Blevins, who was an adviser to our NICAP Subcommittee, I constru cted a magnetic variometer to try and detect distur bances in the local magnetic field. Hopefully, the detector would act as an early warning system fo r the presence of UFOs. Later, in 1973, this magnetic variometer was incorporated into a security alarm system panel and became the MADAR system. Please see the entries for 1973 for more inform ation on this system. September 8, 1970: The m agnetic filed disturbance detect or picked up som ething at 4:45 in the afternoon. No visual sighting was reported. September 22, 1970: Again, the detector indi cated a disturbance in the local m agnetic field. This tim e, it was at about 12:30 PM. Again, ther e were no reports of a visual sighting. October 2, 1970: At 9:55 PM the detector, again, indica ted a disturbance but no one reported any sightings. 1971 - 1972 It is fortu nate for me tha t the rate of UFO sighting was reduced dur ing these years. I was promoted, in 1971, from assistant manager to manager of a la rge department store and had to relocate from Vincennes to Villa Grove, Illinois, a small town n ear Champaign, Illino is. In 1972, I was again pro moted to manager of a larger stor e; this time nea r St. Louis a t Hillsbo ro, Illinois. The detector was not in service during these years and I was not active in UFO investigations. This period, however, was when I began my research and I began tabulating UFO sightings in an eleven state area. In 1972, I was contacted by Walter A ndrus and asked to join MUFON. At that time MUFON was still th e Mid west UFO Network with more or less local inter ests. Now, of course, MU FON is the Mutual UF O Network, Inc., an international or ganization. I became a Field Investigator and a State Section Director for MUFO N over a few counties in Indiana. 39"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" References 1. Don W orley files 2.

As the MUFON representative for this area, I introduced myself to th e local law enforcement and news media representatives. I also established the UFO Filter Center wi th a hotline.

To foster efficient communications between all th e individuals concerned, I crea ted and published a monthly Status Report.

January 1973: The RSID indicates that close encounter s for 1973 began at som e tim e in this m onth with a CE2 sighting reported at Blue Creek, Tennessee. (Ref 1) February 21, 1973: A sighting occurred at Piedmont, Mi ssouri that m ade news all over the country. Reggie Bone, an eight year coach of th e Clearwater High School Ti gers, and five of his basketball players were driving hom e from a basketba ll tournam ent when t hey saw a row of rotating red, green, amber and white lights. They drove on and, shortly, one of the basketball players said, \"There' s that thing we saw over on Highway 60, s itting in the field.\" The witnesses could not discern a shape of the dark object that wa s less than two hundred yards from them and approxim ately fifty feet up in the air; however, it had the sam e light rotation that they had seen previously. The driver stopped the car and they all got out to look. About ten m inutes later the object rose silently at an angle and disappeared behind a ridge. (Ref 2) February 1973: The exact date of this sighting is unknown. At about 8:30 PM a close encounter with a dark object with lights occu rred near Tennyson, Indiana. The fe male witness told m e that she saw the object while sitting in an autom obile pa rked near Tennyson which is a sm all town near Evansville, Indiana. At the tim e of this sighting, the area was rural wi th fields and forests. The sky was very dark and a slight wind was blowing. A ccording to the witness, the object m ade two low passes, less than twenty feet overhead, from nor th to south. The car radio m ay have be en tem porarily knocked out or the witness m ay have been so intently concentr ating on the object that she failed to hear the radio. She m ay even have been hypnotized.

I was sitting in a VW in an isolated area waiting for my husband who was talking to the owners of a far mhouse situated near our car (front yard). It w as an extremely dark night, slight wind. The farm house was a two-story fra me house, br ightly lit upstairs and down. It would surely be an eye catcher to a U FO out in th at iso lated area. \"There was a car parked near our car to the left and a little in front of our car. Soon after m y husband went into the house I heard som ething hit th e car w ith a rather loud bang. I decided a tree lim b had hit it. I played the radio and was getting pretty bored. I happened to look to the left and there was the UFO, quite low and moving directly aw ay from the car to the south. No way could a regular plane have m aneuvered that low and soundle ssly. I was very excited. I was sure it was a UFO and disappointed that it di sappeared over the horiz on and was wishing it w ould com e back. I saw a plane high in the sky, m aking the usual sound, about fifteen m inut es later. In a short tim e, a light started to bounce back and forth off the back of the car to the le ft and in front of me.

(Ref 1) March 22, 1973: A good CE1 sighting which occurred about 9:15 PM which, in future years, really im pressed me. A witnes s, Mr. Oscar W ills, 57 ye ars old, was an opera ting enginee r at the Centr al Illinois Public Service C ompany' s power genera ting station located on th e Mississipp i River at Grand Tower, Illino is. Mr. W ills was on duty a t the station when anothe r em ployee, Mr. W illis Hughes, a tu rbine operator, telephon ed from his ho me in Grand Tower to ask Mr. W illis to check on som ething that was hovering over or near the station' s 66,000 volt transf orm er yard. Mr. W illis went out the north door of the power generating stati on and immediately saw an object approxim ately 1,500 feet in the air over the yard. He estim ated the object' s size to be twenty-five feet in diam eter and it w as about 250 yards away. He described the object as a ring of lighted panels or windows with definite spacing between them . Each window was e mitting pulsating light v aryin g from a dark red to orange to white in color se quenced in a clockwise rotation that resembled a theater m arquee. The pulsations gave the im pres sion that the object was sp inning clockwise but the separation between the windows was st ationary. He said that the object was donut shaped or m ore like a wedding band because only the lighted panels or windows were visible. Mr. W illis walked to within 150 y ards of the tran sfor mer bank while viewing the object with g reat curiosity. T hen, he becam e slightly apprehensive and decided to return to the power plant building and ask two other em ployees on duty to com e out to witness the phenom enon. As he retraced his steps the object, which had been hovering directly ov er the transform er bank, started m oving directly toward him and passed over his head. As the object darted noiselessly past the northwest corner of the building he lost sight of it m omentarily becaus e the building obstructed his field of v iew. He walked rapid ly around to the west side of the building which faces the Mississippi River and noted that th e object was now hovering directly over the m iddle of the three water pum ping station buildings. H e walked up the ram p leading to the pum p station house and out on to the wall which protected the plant from the rive r. In this location, he was again directly under 41"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"the hovering object. Mr. W illis s tated that the ob ject at th is p oint appeared to be abou t the s ize of a circular object four and one half to five feet in diam eter held at arm 's length. After watching the object for seven to eight m inut es, th e plan t speaker sy stem operator called Mr. Willis back to answer a telephone call within th e plant bu ildin g. The calle r was Mr. Willis Hughes who wanted to know what Oscar cou ld see from his vantage point. Mr. W illis cut th e telephone conversation short so that he and the two other men on duty could go outside to view the object. When they went back o utside the ob ject was gon e. In approxim ately 25 to 30 m inutes, three or four jet aircraft m ade eight to ten sw eeps over the area about two to th ree m inutes apart. The nearest military bas e is Scott Air Force Base in Bellev ille, Illinois. ( Ref 4) There were other sightings in Missouri, some of which were close encounter sightings, continuing into Ma y. Then the s ightings began to spread into Illinois. B y August, so me multiple witness cas es occurred in Illinois which are worthy of mention. August 4, 1973: Several sightings w ere reported near Greenup, Illinois. At 8:00 PM, three witnesses reported that a boxcar si zed object descended in a sideways manner toward their car. The driver slam med on the brakes throwing one passenge r against the dashboard. W ith one end of the object settling towards the ground first, the object appe ared to land in a corn field. T hen, a m an a nd his son returning from a fishing trip in their car, saw, apparently, the sam e object in the air over a far mhouse about three quarters of a m ile away. They described the object as being \"big as a house.\" It was rectangular in shape, even ly illum inated, and seem ed to be descending. Their view of the object was lost as the car went down a dip in the road. Then, a girl reported that she saw one end of the object over som e trees. She said that it \"looked like som ebody pulled a string and pulled the end down.\" August 19, 1973: At night, the \"boxcar\" object, previously seen on August 4th, was seen by over 200 persons who reported the sighting to a disc jockey at radi o station WEIC in Charleston. Jim Jenson, the station disc jockey, sai d, \"about 80% of the reports were id entical in their descriptions of the UFO.\" (Ref 6) August 1973: The exact date of this si ghting is unknown. At about 9:00 PM just w est of Princeton, Indiana, the prim e witness, an electrical eng ineer with a m ajor electronics firm , age 38, told m e, \"we were over at m y m other-in-law' s in Mt.

It' s going to be kinda stirred up. But, directly in line with this was Owensville Road. We thought m aybe they m ight be headlights bouncing off low clouds. These (lights) were up in th e air. Our angle of pe rspective changed as we approached it, so we found out it was above the tr ees. The lightning caught up with us about this tim e and a pretty good sized bolt was behind it and we got it illum inated, all around us, and we saw what appeared to be a ' saucer' . (Exhibit 1D) Kinda weird but the whole fam ily witnessed it and nothing was said until we got hom e. 42"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" \"W hat surprised m e, of c ourse, we thought it was a car because it was the sa me spectral response that you' d have (receiv ed) from hea dlights.

And, this thing (the cone) didn' t appear to be solid, the cone that cam e down to the ground or whatever it went down to. It was sort of wide at the bottom of the sauc er and evidently went to a point which could have been the opposite of a flashlight beam . And, ah, we kinda got a shock over it.

The object described on pa ge 63 of the MUFON Sy mposium proceedings b ears a VERY STRONG resemblance to the UFO observed in the August 1973 sighting listed above. The drawing down by the witness in th is sighting appears to resemble an alleged photograph I have. The source and any other details concer ning the photograph are not known. On an unknown date also in August 1973, the Skylab III crew photographed a strange red object in earth orbit on the 59th day of the flight. The object was not more than th irty to f ifty nautic al m iles from skylab. It rotated for several m inutes before disappearing. August 22, 1973: The RSID shows a CE2 trace case sighting at St. Joseph, Missouri. Summer, 1973: On an unknown date but in the summertim e, four persons repor ted that at about 9:30 PM, a \"catfish shaped\" object w ith a flat bot tom cast a floodlight on their car near Littleton, Indiana. The object passed over their car. It was observed for about ten m inutes before the witnesses lost sigh t of the object. A whis tling noise sim ilar to an airflow sound was reportedly heard. (Ref 3) In September, sighting reports began to greatly in crease. Most of th ese reports were of distant sighting s, ho wever, FI Don Worley investigated a case for th e Center fo r UFO Studies (CUFOS) that may have been a short term abduction; a CE4.

At 11:00 PM near Mansfield, Ohio a CE2 sighting occurred. An Ar my Reserve helicopter with a crew of four m en encountered a gray, m etallic looking, cigar shap ed object with unusual lights and maneuvers as they flying between Colum bus and Cleveland, Ohio.

The light turned toward the helico pter and app eared to be on a converging flight path. Captain Lawrence C oyne verified his crewm an's assessm ent, grabbed the controls from the helicopter pilot, and put th e UH-1H helicopter into a powered descent of approxim ately five hundred feet per m inute. Al most simultaneously Coyne established radio contact with Mansfield control tower ten m iles to the northwest. Coyne thought that the light was an Air National Guard F- 100 aircraft from Mansfield. The red light continued its radial bearing and increased greatly in in tensity. Coyne increase the rate of descent of the helicopter to tw o thousand feet per m inute and his airspeed to one hundred knots. The last altitude he noted was 1,700 feet.

The helicopter, however, inst ead of going down was going up! (Ref 13) Thanks to Jennie Zeidman the NSID lists eight other sightings in Ohio that night. These sightings confirm that something truly unusual was in the skies over Ohio near where Captain Coyne and his crew encoun ter th e UFO. One sighting involved w itnesses in a car who obser ved th e UFO, the lig ht beam, and the helicopter. October 19, 1973: At 8:35 PM over Ohio a private aircra ft with two observers aboard reported sighting a UFO and they picked it up on the aircraft radar. (Ref 14) At about 9:0 0 PM at Goshen, Indian a a m an out raccoon hunting with his dogs cam e on a dim ly lit object on tripod legs about three hundred feet aw ay.

After about three m inutes of observation the figures clim bed a ladder under the center of the objec t, which took of f vertically. (Ref 8) October 20, 1973: I received a call early in the morning from a train conductor who had just had an encounter with a UFO at 6:50 AM just a few m iles eas t of my hom e; at a point on the railroad tracks near St. Phillips. The previous train crew had experienced engine trouble near Upton, Indiana, a sm all town three or four m iles northwest of Mt. Vernon. One of the rear diesel units overheated. The Burlington engine was pulling a six thousand ton load and wa s overloaded without the rear diesel units. The off goi ng conductor, a 30 year m an with the railroa d, m entioned to Mr. \"P\" that the rear un it was \"dead\" and that there w as \"ne use m essi ng with it\" because he had already tried. In any case, the new crew lumbered into Mt. Vernon taking twenty to tw enty-five m inutes longer to get there than us ual. The sk y was clear. The te mperature was a cool 55 degrees and the wind was calm . It was about 6:50 AM. The train had gone through Mt. Vernon and was neari ng the Lam ont crossing a bout two m iles east of the city head ing west to Evansville. The sun wa s just barely peaking ove r the tree top s. The two men in the front engine saw a bri ght but distant light in the sky co ming from the north. At first they thought it was an aircraft, the late r decided that it couldn' t be. Th e object was tracking north to south and was pulsating form very bright to dim and back to bright. The distant light appeared to travel a short distance, approxim ately fifty to sixty feet, between pulsations. The li ght f inally turned to a more easterly direction and disappeared. When the train neared Caborn which is six to seve n m iles east of Mt. Vernon, the conductor told the crew in th e rear of the train that they had seen a v ery bright light.

Mr. \"P\" again told him that he ha dn' t heard anything on the radio. Mr. \"C\" reportedly then stated s omething to the effect th at \"W ell, he' s been following us and I can see his light back there and the ' board' s' red!\" The object f ollowing them had given them a \"red signal\" on their blocking system . The signal referred to h ere is a se rie s of colo red lights sim ilar in co lor to regula r traffic ligh ts, situ ated on a po le on the side of the tracks. The blocking system lights show either red, green, or am ber m eaning danger, all clear, or caution respectiv ely. The light system is part of the autom atic blocking system which tells each conductor of other traffic on the sam e track. The \"red board\" comm ent norm ally means that som ething was on the track behind them . A quick check with the train yard m aster revealed that there was no train behind them at all. Upon receiving this news, Mr. \"C\" reportedly replied, \"There is a headlight behind us. I can see it.

Actually, it was qui et in my particular area of interest in the early part of 1974. January 8, 1974: A CE3 was reported at Spri ngfield, Ohio. (Ref 1) January 17, 1974: A CE3 occurred at Shores, Tennessee. (Ref 2) In February, 1974, the Center for UFO Studies (C UFOS) in Evanston, Illinois printed its first newsletter. J. Allen Hynek, the former UFO consu ltant to Project Blue B ook, was the director of CUFOS. CUFOS later relocated to C hicago, Illinois. February 4, 1974: Another CE3 sighting was reported at Shores, Tennessee. (Ref 3) February 9, 1974: An abduction was reported at Shores, Tennessee. (Ref 2) At this tim e, there we re CE1 a nd CE2 sightings being reported a ll over the U.S. The CE3 sightings where hum anoids are observed were, however, getting all the attention. May 9, 1974: A CE4 occurred very near Mt. Vernon, Indian a. In fact, it was only 25-30 m iles from us. The original sighting report was i nvestigated by FI Don W orley who related the incident to m e. In later years the case was invest igated by Mike Christol. The sighting involved a local m an and six other witnesses w ho, at the tim e of the sighting, were working f or a vacuum cleaner s ales c ompany and were re turning hom e on Highway 57 af ter se lling vacuum swe epers. The moon had just com e up and was on the horizon at the tim e. An object appeared about 300 feet away a nd 100 feet above the ground.

The back door itself was open but the outside screen door was closed. \"I was laying in bed. I heard a lit tle disturbance on the front porch. It sounded like a dog kickin' . We did have four dogs at that tim e. They're always in a ruckus. All of a sudden I saw three big headed 'things' com ing around the side of the house, st epping up on the porch, opening the door up just about a foot, enough to squeeze th rough com ing into that utility room where th e wash ing m achine and dryer w as at, stopping right in front of that before they entered m y bedroom doorway, about three foot, standing in there gazing at m e. I rem ember m y rea ctions at th e tim e, 'what the hell h ave I done? ' I thought they w ere som e kind of de mons or ghosts or som ething. I had no idea what they were. And then, they cam e in m y be droom .\" They cam e near to the right side and at the foot of his bed. All three of them stood there, \"just looking m e right square in the face. T hey looked at me, and then they all looked at each other, and then began to ' pogo' or bob up a nd down, just like they got som e kind of i ncredible excitem ent.\" They, then, stopped this move ment. The bed covers were on the end of the bed and he quickly pulled them up over him self. Two of the entities then moved forward, grabbed the blanket and pulled it down. The ot her being moved ahead toward the doorway and the other tw o grabbed h im and took him . When they took hold of his hand he said he felt like he was num b all over. \"It m ight have been fear or it m ight have been som ething they did.\" H e described his feeling as \"creepy, almost like a haunting feeling.\" \"They took m e outside and (we walked) one in th e front, one on each sid e, by the han d, went arou nd the corner of the side of the house, and there wa s this other m an standing there by the side of the house.

T here appeared to be only telepathic communication and only with the one who he thought was the older one. The older one, m ore or less, told him to sit dow n on the couch or whatever it was. First, they took a sam ple of his ha ir. They took the sam ple from the le ft side of his head toward the back. Then, they began to do som e annoying things. The older alien took a long, silver, pencil like instrum ent and stuck it in his m outh and began to look at his teeth. \"And a ll the tim e the other three were just standing there observi ng, like they were learning som ething.

The other three tended to be ve ry curious of what I wa s going to do, and how I was going to react to this. It was ju st like a teach er teaching s tudents. That' s th e way I took it. \"Then, all of a sudden, he instructed m e to lay down fl at on my back. W ell, I began to balk a little bit then.

A m ale neighbor, two days later, m et his father at a grain elevator. Both w ere farm ers. The neighbor told the witness' father that he saw som ething land in the field around m idnight.

(R ef 5) July 30, 1974: At 8:50 P M a sighting occurred near Solit ude, Indiana. Later that evening I received a phone call from the local County S heriff, Bill Cox. Sheriff Cox told me that a well known and respected lo cal coup le h ad just enco untered a UFO. I alerted the local F Is; B yron Koenig and Greg Bacher t, and all three of us de parted in separate cars to see if anything of interest was still occurring. We were all som ewhat tense about w hat had been reported. Each vehicle had a CB radio. W e all watched the sk ies look ing f or the rep orted object and talking together as we drove. We didn' t see anything in the sky but, on our trip back, all three vehicles experienced a loss of CB radio communications . We never figured out w hy we could not communicate that evening. W e were only separated by about a quarter m ile on the highway but we could not communicate on the radios. As usual the first interrogation of the m ain w itness to this sighting t ook place over the telephone. The witness said th at at 8 :50 PM, near Solitud e, Indiana, which is about th ree m iles no rth of Mt. Vernon, Indiana, they and their li ttle boy were returning hom e by car to Mt. Vernon after attending a play in New Harm ony, I ndiana. They were trave ling south on Highway 69 when they observed an object silho uetted again st the m oonlit haze that wa s hanging in the sou thwest. Althou gh a couple of miles away, the object had a clear cig ar shape with three steady white lights on it. They continued down the highway and, as they topp ed a sm all hill, the object began to descend appearing to get large r and la rger a ll the tim e. W hen they reach ed the bottom of the h ill the y slowed down. The object appeared to be hovering approxim ately a hundred yards from them . The object was m oving very slowly. \"It acted like it was on water or som ething. It was just floatin' like.\" It now had four lights on it; two on each end.

It had just vanished.\" T he object was \"thin on th e ends\" and, \"as it got to the m iddle, it was thicker. But, like I say, we could just see the shadow.\" (Ref 5) The sighting duration was seven to ten m inutes. The UFO did not activate the MADAR alarm even though it was very close to the MADAR location. It was not detected on radar, either. I was told by the rad ar people that an object that low was below the radar beam and would not have been detected. A f ew days later, I m et the witnesse s, co mpleted the f orm s, and f iled the re port. August 15, 1974: MADAR was triggered at 12:19 AM. One of the MADAR recorders alm ost imm ediately picked up a clap of t hunder. A very close li ghtning strike caused it to go in to alarm . September 3, 1974: At 9:35 PM MADAR anom aly No. 7 occu rred. There were no close sightings that were reported; however, a MA DAR event record er showed background radiation levels rose to 86% above norm al. In alm ost every instance of MA DAR activation, the radar at Dre ss Regional airport was not in service at th e tim e of the alarm .

What appeared to be the flashing lights of a police, fire, or EMT vehicle in the dark cam e towards us from the we st about a quarter m ile away. The flashing lights then turned south on Highway 62 and headed towa rd Mt. Vernon. Later, a voice on the CB radio told us that he had seen a civil defense fire truck at 8:15 and 8:30 PM. W e never inquired where the C B radio user was located or asked if the vehicles he had seen had their lights flashing. When we checked with the police dispatcher w e found that, in fact, there had been a fire that night, but for som e reason we didn' t bother to check in to it any further to determ ine th e loca tion of the f ire o r when it occurred. None of us rem embers seeing autom obile headlights. W e all saw just a bunch of red, blue, and white flashing lights sim ilar to those on EM T vehicles. The m ystery surfaced when we check ed where the lights cam e from before turning south on the high way. There was no road intersecting with Highway 62 at that point. The lights would have had to pass low over a cornfield in order to m ove the way that they did. (Ref 5) November 11, 1974: A CE3 sighting was reported at Cr oss Mountain, T ennessee. (Ref 6) November 28, 1974: A sighting from an aircraft occurred at 11:43 AM over Shabonna, Illinois. A pilot with three and on e half years of experience was flying an Aeronca Cha mp, aircraft num ber N82198, from DeKalb to Mendota, Illinoi s. It w as bright daylight with visibility lim ited to six to seven m iles by haze. Th e pilo t was flying at an altitude of 2,500 feet on a com pass heading of 240 degrees. As the aircraft passed ov er the sm all town of Sha bonna, the p ilot was checking his po sition on the aeronautical chart that he held on his lap in orde r to dete rm ine if he wa s still on cou rse for his destination of Mendota. W hen he looked up from the m ap he noticed with am aze ment that the magnetic compass was rotating counter clockwise at four to f ive rpm . He then looked to his right and saw nothing but the town of Shabonn a below him. W hen he looked to his left, however, he saw an object f lying parallel to h im at the sa me speed of 75 to 80 m ph and at th e sam e altitud e. The objec t was pacing him at 120 degrees at an estim ated quarter m ile distance. He described the object as being shaped like a disc or ellipse. If the dist ance between the observer and the object is accurate, the object would have been 120 feet long and 3 0 feet thick. It appeared to be a solid object, white or dull silv er in color, without any openings or protrusions. There m ay have been a depression on the top of the object but the angle ne cessary to view the top only occurred for a brief second as the object departed. After pacing the aircraft for eight to ten seconds, the object tipped slightly and the pilot saw that it was actually round and n ot an ellipse.

The object causing the illum ination was a twenty to thirty foot, disc shaped object that was descendi ng into their field of view. The object had red and yellow rotating light s around the lower edge of it' s rim. Apparently trying to land, the objec t was about 1,000 feet from the ro ad and descended to about fifty feet above the trees when the witnesses lost it from view due to obstructi ons. They never saw the object again that night. Later, the trio parked th eir car at an intersec tion facing north with Darm stadt Road running east and west in front of the parked vehicle. At 4:30 AM, in the northeast a light appeared that moved around and projected beam s downward as it began to des cend. It was about a m ile away from the witnesses and about fifty feet abov e the treetop s. The beam s continu ally broke up and never seem ed to reach the ground. The driver started the car and headed west on R oute 13. The pie shaped object changed course and followed the car at about a 1/2 m ile distance.

The UFO, fifty to sixty feet wide, had green and white li ghts around the lower part and seem ed to be rotating. A white light shone from three or four squa re windows around the upper portion (see the Blyton drawing, October 16, 1973, exhibit 2C) where two sm all dark hum anoid fi gures could be seen to be m oving back and forth in \"cramped positions\" continually gesticul ating (or, moving levers ) with th eir arm s.

She was startled by a brilliant object seen th rough a south facing window of her hom e. The object was described as big and round, m oving slowly eas tward following Fourth Street over the tree tops. The object st eered a steady, slow, eastward cour se without stopping over a nearby grocery while changing to a reddish color. The witne ss stated that the object had tentacles or legs. The duration of the observation was one or two m inutes.

When Bobby' s father, Mr. Bob Doane, ran outside the object was gone. The witness said that the object resem bled \"two Frizbees together edge to edge about 27 feet across.

However, acco rding to th e witness, th ere never was any sound connected with the UFO. (Ref 2) Steps were taken by Dr. Hynek' s group at the Ce nter for UFO Studies (CUFOS) to improve the transm ission of UFO reports from the public to the UFO investigative co mmunity. On April 1, 1975, the Feder al Aviation Ad ministra tion approved cooperation with CU FOS, authorizing air traffic contro llers and other personnel to report UFO sightings as th eir worklo ad perm itted. This, plus CUFOS request for coo peration fro m law enforcem ent officials, helped ensure UFO reports were sent to som eone who could follow up on them .

(Ref 3) October 27, 1975: Beginning on this date, serious incide nts took place along the U.S./Canadian border involving all of the northern tier U.S. Air Force bases in th at area. (Ref 4) In 1983, I appeared on a two hour, radi o call in talk show on WGBF in Evansville, Indiana. During the show, an ex-Air Force m an called in and repo rted that an alert had tak en place at Headquarters, North Am erican Air Def ense Command ( NORAD) during these sightings. The NORAD Command Post, Cheyenne Mountai n, Colorado, includes the National Com bat Operations Center.

In late October, 1975, when bona fide UFOs vi olated airspace over NORAD Comma nd Post enough concern was generated for NORAD to upgr ade their security alert status. No one except cleared, high ranki ng officers or security patrols was allowed to enter the Cheyenne Mountain base. No one was allowed to leave. T hose persons on base who had just completed duty were called back to wor k. Jet in ter ceptors were s cram bled.

Hearing the klaxons, they imm ediat ely packed their gear and headed for the Mountain to m an their security posts. They had been off duty for ten to twelve hours but, except for the pilot among them , they were still subject to reca ll to duty as part of the s ecurity f orce for the Mountain.

At 0210 hours they showed their passes to the ga te guard and were adm itted as part of th e base se curity f orce. Th ey did not have an opportunity to change clothes and were still in their hunting gear. They retrieved their weapons and reported to thei r assigned security posts.

He stated that it was \"weird\" and proceed ed to describ e the radar tracks to the rest of the group. His descrip tion matched what the rest of th e group had seen visually. A couple of days later som e of the men in the gro up began checking into the records to try determ ine the reason for the security alert. They found that nothing about the alert was in the records. \"W e couldn' t find anything in the records th at were av ailab le to us, \" said Mr. E. \"Now, we didn' t try to get into clearan ce areas, but the records that were av aila ble to u s were prim arily se curity r ecords.\" Eve n 62"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"the files of the radar m en of the group were devoid of any mention of the alert.

The W alton experience becom e the subject of a motion pictur e, \"Fire in the Sky\", released in March 1993. 1976 January 6, 1976: At 11:15 PM a now well publicized CE4 sighting took place at Stan ford, Kentucky. Louise Sm ith, Mona Stafford, and Elai ne Thom as were abducted. Please see the very detailed description description of this sighting , which seem s destined to becom e a classic, as related by L eonard Stringfield' s paper published in Skylook. (Ref 5) February 7, 1976: At 5:15 AM, a m iddle aged couple a few miles north of Mt. Vernon, Indiana at Farm ersville had a clos e encounter. The initial inv estig ation of this s ightin g was conducted by Greg Ward, one of the FIs I had trained. The couple lived in a m obile hom e. The dog was barking and woke them up so the m an looked out a window, saw a light, and went outside on the porch to see what was arousing the dog. The sky was clear and the weather m ust not hav e been to co ld because he walked out on the porch in his nig ht clothes. There had been som e thefts of gasoline in the area an d he was concerned abo ut this. He also wanted to check on the security of som e equipm ent: a backhoe, a dum p truck, a 4-wheel drive, etc. He \"saw the glow from the object. \" The whole area was lit u p \"like a dusk to dawn light that wasn' t supposed to be there.\" His wife didn' t, at first com e out of the house. When she did, she only went out on the porch. \"She was scared f or two or th ree da ys after that,\" he said. He was at the rear of the traile r looking south at the object which was less than two hundred feet above the ground and five to six hundred yards aw ay. At first it was stationary but then m oved slowly eastward clim bing gradually. He said that he knew what airplanes, balloons, and dirigibles looked like and it wasn' t anything lik e those things. \"It was shaped a whole lot like a dirigible but it was flat on the bottom .\" The object continued to move eastwar d across a field and a g ully to a point south of his son' s trailer about five to six hundred yards fr om his own trailer. The object appeared to long and som ewhat rectangular shaped with blunt e nds and a strong yellow-greenish b eam of light com ing from it that could be seen m oving very slowly across the open field. The witness said th at it was a \"gree nish, pink ish , overly bright light, extrem ely bright light. I stood there at th e window (at first). I' m telling you I co uld see the g round out th ere, th e gras s, the weeds. . .clear as a bird. . .good n' daylight (like).\" \"W hen I first saw it,\" he continued, \"it was le ss than two hundred feet (of f the ground).\" A little later, just sou th o f his son' s trailer, th ere was a round object. \"It wa s darker green than the rectangular thing and looked like it w as right in the fence row. This one looked like it m ight have been eight or ten feet in diam eter and on, or very near, the ground. It changed color f rom pale green 64"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"to bright blue and back to pale green. W hen the la rger rectan gular ob ject got over in the area back of the trailer an d a little sou th, the sm aller sphere m oved up to the bottom of the big object and went out lik e a lig ht.\" The sin gle rem ainin g object then departed slowly to the east. The m ain rectangular object app eared to be projecting a beam of light that was com ing down and for ming a moving bright rectangle on the ground. \"And, I could see clouds going between the object and the (round) thing that was down here on the ground, which I (at first) presum ed was (from ) a beam of light.\" The large object was m oving very slowly. \"I m ean I've heard stories about them zoom ing away. They didn' t. It was slow. It was (going) easy, just like it was drifting with the wind, but it was going up and going in that direction (east). The witness return ed to h is bed while the obje ct, n ow very distant, was m oving slowly away. (Ref 2) March 26, 1976: At 8:45 AM the MADAR system indicat ed an anom aly. The background radiation was norm al and no one filed a UFO report. This was MADAR anom aly No. 8. March 27, 1976: I had a sighting myself within a m ile of m y house at 5:05 PM. The object I saw was oblong and very high in the sky. It looked like a jet airliner without wi ngs. I watched it for about 25 seconds. The MADAR unit did n ot reg ister an anom aly most likely because it w asn' t a real UFO. We 'll never know. June or early July, 1976: A huge, \"barbell\" shaped UFO wa s seen by tw o witnesses at 7:20 AM near Liberty in Union County, Indiana. The objec t was just sitting in the sky som ewhere beyond a train that was passing. It was a silver-gray, m etalli c object with a few \"black spaced p laces\" that o ne witness thou ght were windows. There was an ope n space in the bar between the two b alls. The im pression of the witnesses were th at the object was as large as a football field. Afte r about thirty seconds, the object m oved behind a single tree in the landscap e and vanished. (Ref 3) August 15, 1976: At 10:55 PM an object was sighted in a creek bed off Harrisburg Road in Fayette County, Indiana. The m ain witness, the m other of a rural fam ily, while out in her backyard noticed a wide band of light under som e trees in a nearby cr eek bed. The whole family watched as a glowing white oval object slowly rose up out of the creek bed and flew away to the northeast where it assum ed a dark oval shape with green and red li ghts revolving around its edge or m iddle. Their appeared to be a hum p or dom e on top of the object. (Ref 3) August 18, 1976: The August 15, 1976, sighting above , was repeated. (Ref 3) October 28, 1976: One of the strangest UFO sighting reports that I' ve ever personally investigated occurred at 7:05 PM at Evansville, Indiana. There were six witnesses to this event. Although it was a night sighting, the distance between the witnesses and the object at its cl osest was two hundred to two hundred fifty feet which m akes this a close en cou nter s ighting . The high degree of strangeness is evident from the testim ony of witness Lee Golden: \"This is no hallucination. This thing cam e right over the top of the house (which was fifty feet from the 65"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"witnesses), I' d say at one hundred to one hundred fifty feet over the top of the house. A nd, it was rectangular on the top and had a bi g light at the bottom . I couldn' t see how the bottom was m ade, but it was totally noise-proof (there wa s no sound at all).\" As it cam e ove r it appeared to be the size of an autom obile and it was gaining altitude and m oving northw ard. W hen it got to a higher altitude, som ething shot out from the bottom of the object . Later, som ething shot out from the side. The object cam e from the south, initially headed northward at low altitude (one hundred to one hundred fifty feet), then turned and began m oving to the northeast, gainin g altitude and finally shrinking to the size of a st ar. The duration of the enti re sighting was 15 minutes. \"The object had a rectangular shap ed cage of some sort on the t op portion (Exhibit 1E), and looked very clearly like it had som e sort of cylinder or entrance from top to bottom located in the m iddle (see drawing). Also, noticed what appeared to be a door or heavy screened opening at the top part located in th e m iddle.\" The ligh ts on the obje ct in itia lly h ad a yellow cas t and th en changed to white. The object moved very slowly at first and then moved quickly away and out of sight. (Ref 2) Other, distant sightings of lim ited merit, occurred in 1976 which are not listed here. References 1.

CHAPTER 7 - 1977, A MADAR YEAR It started out like m ost years. W e we re always ho ping for something really exciting to sink our teeth into. But nothing was going on, at least reg ionally , un til M arch 23rd. I' ve always said that som e of the best close encounters occur in the wee hours, and this one is a good exam ple. A lady was driving on State Road 36 near Farm land, Indiana, on a snowy m orning. Farm land is in Randolph County, northeast of Indianapolis on the In diana/Ohio border. The lady noti ced that som e blue lights were ahead and thought that they were on a snow plow. One blinking light of unknown shape flew across in front of her, then suddenly 6-12 blue lights took up position two to three feet in front of her slowly trave ling c ar. The car wa s illum inate d with a blu e ligh t and s tatic cam e over the radio . W hen the lights dived, a red light cam e on, as if braking. Th e sm all lights all flew to gether and out of sight over a field. (Ref.1) On April 5th, there was a notewor thy encounter in broad daylight near Deerfield, Illinois. At 2:17 PM in the af ternoon, a pilot was northbound, driv ing on I-94 on a cold, cloudy day. The sky was overcast at 5,000' . He re ported that he saw an object com ing toward him , first in the d istan ce, then directly above him . He described it as like a silver m ushroom, about three tim es the apparent size of the m oon, that m oved silently toward distant Ch icago, against the wind. Th e object was in view 60- 90 seconds. (Ref.2) The next case is interesting, but probably not a close encounter. On May the 8th, there was a 30- second observation of a strange craf t near Joliet, Illinoi s. An adult couple driving westbound at 2:00 PM watched a silv er \"s traw hat\" the size of the moon , rush eastbound over 1-80. The object m ade no discernible noise (possibly m asked by ca r) and was flying against the wind. (Ref.3) Thirty m inutes la ter, ne ar Jolie t, another adult couple experienced an object like a silver sphere with a \"saturn ring\" or \"halo\". around it. This was eas tbound, too, and was in view for about 30 seconds. (Ref.3) In June we had a sighting about 30 m iles to the north-west of us, at Mt. Carm el , Illinois. It started with a distant sighting at 9:00 PM on June 9th. Byron Buchanan describes his encounter with a UFO: \"Me and Scott were com ing back fr om a ball gam e. Scott had been the pitcher. W e were just com ing back into Mt. Carm el. We saw a bright light. First we thought it was a falling star, but it was extrem ely bright. W e we re waiting for it to burn out, but it didn' t. It just kept falling and falling, and before it \"hit\" the ground, it split in two. So we followed it and kept following it, and when we got out to th e place where w e thought it hit, th ere were 4-5 oth er cars out there. So they h ad seen what we had seen and, hell, w e stayed there about an hour, hour and a half. Everybody (else) took off after about 30-45 m inutes.\" About 10:00 or 10:30 P M, another object was observ ed. \"O ne of the objects took off and went over the car, probably 100-300 yards abov e. The only one that took off wa s a silver disc and it took off, shooting. That' s when I went hom e and called the sheriff' s de partm ent and then called the Evansville airport and they gave us your num ber. 67"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"\"The next day we went out looking for it. It' s hard to estim ate wher e it exactly hit. It glided down like a shooting star. Before it cam e dow n (to Earth) it split in two.

At first it cam e down l ike a shooting star, fa st, then it slowed down.\" Louis Blevins was the scientist who helped m e design the MADAR system, and he told m e that he had worked on \"Project Saucer\" back in the late 40' s. He said that evidence indicated UFOs could disrupt the local m agnetic field up to a five m ile radius. I later learned that an Air Force report had studied a cas e where a prospector h ad seen a UF O and watched his com pass needle spin. W ell, things were about to get spinning! MADAR Anomaly No. 9 On July 10th, at 1:04 A M, the siren s ounded! I jum ped out of bed and headed for the room downstairs where the equipm ent was set up, and hit the audio alarm switch. The siren, now silent, had done its job. W hile the rest of the county sl ept, MADAR was recording a 17-pulse disturbance in the local m agnetic field. The anom aly lasted 55 seconds. This was the longest disturbance on record at th e station at th at ti me and the fluctuations were th e most erratic ever recorded by MADAR' s event recorder. Background radiation was a norm al 16 counts per m inute. I had looked outside to see if there was anythi ng in sight, in all dir ections. Nothing unusual, at least near the facility. MADAR was still r ecording data at that tim e . When I was sure th e event was over, I rese t the sensor, pulled out the data tapes, labeled them and put new ones in the data recorders. There were no calls com ing into the Center. I had contac ted the police departm ent and spoke with Officer Kerm it Steele. He hadn' t heard anything, either. I went back to bed. For days I pondered over what had happened, a little dism ayed that I couldn' t get what I' d hoped for, for years, a correlation between detections and lo cal sightings. This would be a documented cause and effect relationship, proof UFOs c ouldn' t be all IFOs, and I would also have an \"early warning system \". I also wanted to be able to g rab a cam era and run with it, getting a pictu re to go with the other data. Or, have an independe nt witness ca lling in a UFO that was o bserved a t th e sam e tim e MADAR was picking up an anom aly. Even if I had had a cam corder in those days, it wouldn' t have done any good. MADAR Anomaly No. 10 Two days later the siren sounded again! On July 12t h, at 1:48 AM, I jum ped out of bed with greater expectations. This was a one-pulse disturbance. On the data tape there was no reading. The first pulse (I call the \"phantom pulse\") is the one th at turns on th e syst em , therefore it is no t reco rded. Radiation background was 18 cpm , still norm al for the area. No calls. No visual sightings from the facility. The police departm ent was alerted, but had heard nothing from ca llers or cruisers. MADAR Anomaly No. 11 At 4:35 AM I was awakened again by the sire n, indicating an anom aly wa s occurring. Two hours and 47 m inu tes had elapsed and MADAR had recorded another anom aly. This tim e it was a 5-pulse, 68"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"53-second disturbance. Radiation w as a norm al 16 cpm . I went through all the m otions, however probably appearing as a \"zom bie\" to anyone who could have seen m e, and went back to bed. I don' t know why. I think the sun was com ing up. I didn' t record the tim e. I should have. But som etime within an hour, the sm oke alarm star ted beeping. T here was no sm oke or noticeable fum es. The batte rie s were in pe rfect order and no t rep laced u ntil s ix m onths later! In o rder for th e beeping signal to occur, the batteries must be lo w. Som ething caused the voltage to drop or m imic the sam e effect as low power. W hatever it was, it was an anom aly in itself, because th ere was nothing wrong with the unit or the b atterie s. MADAR Anomaly No 12 Three days later, on July 15th, this tim e at 10:06 PM, MADAR logged another one. T his was a 4- pulse, 4-second disturbance, radiat ion 13 cpm . Again, it seem ed as if it was all a waste of tim e. Right across the Ohio River from Cincinnati, Ohio, is a little town in Kentucky, called Bellevue. A t 10:45 PM that evening, Mrs. Fern Frey (nam e ch anged) was lying in bed with her 11-year-old daughter who was asleep. She was shocked to s ee her bed light up with a bright green glow. Thinking her hone was being burglarized, Mrs. Frey jum ped out of bed. (There was a lot of this \"jum ping out bed\" this summ er). The glow wa s coning through one of the two windows in the bedroom . She cautiously peeked through the curtain a nd watched in bewilderm ent as the green light retreated, \"just like a liquid bei ng drawn up through a straw.\" In a m atter of seconds the light was \"siphoned\" up into a low hovering object that was shaped like an inve rted saucer a couple of hundred feet away. She guessed it was about 30' in diam eter and was m etallic. Th e m oon' s glow reflected on it and sh e co uld determ ine that its visible surface was clearly divide d into equal-s ized squares. The bottom was in darkness, appearing flat, and it was in to th is s ection that th e reco iling b ean of light was drawn. The object then gracef ully lifted and disappeared in to a wood ed area. (Ref.4) Then, on a routine visit to the Mt. Vernon Police Depa rtm ent as part of my local PR work, Officer Kerm it Steele had advised m e that they had pick ed up transm issions on the police radio from two locations. T his had happened righ t af ter I called o n the 12th ? At approxim ately 2:18 AM, citizens had been reporting UFOs to poli ce at Mt. Vernon, Illinois, 68 m ile s to the northwest of us? Also, reports were com ing in from Hayfield, Kentucky, 85 m iles to the southwest! Finally, I had a corre lation ? Not a loca l one, but too much to be a coincidence. That evening a report cane in over the KNI Net (police scanner frequency), som ebody had phoned in a report to the Kentucky State Police at Hancoc k County. They thought they had seen an aircraft \"going down\". This has happened many tim es. I imm ediately contacted the Control Tower at Dress- Regional Airport. No aircraft was ever reported missing or crashed. This was a m eteor or a UFO. We 'll never know. But things we re starting to look very odd. MADAR Anomaly No 13 This was logged on July 26th. This was in the w ee hours, at 2:29 AM, a one- pulse, w ith radiation a norm al 16 cpm . I was now getting enough sleep. Th e events were getting farther apart. On July 31st, Nor mal, Illinois, had a daylight si ghting of interest. At 6: 30 PH, a university art professor called his wife and secret ary to see the silve r \"s tre tched cigar\", three tines the size of the 69"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"moon in length. It was observed for three m inutes as it flew in a slow straight path from southwest to northeast, with no trail, no wings , no details, no sounds. (Ref.5) MADAR Anomaly No 14 This was logged on August 1st at 10:11 PM. It was a 4-pulse, 4-second disturbance with a 16 cpm reading. It w as starting to get boring. MADAR Anomaly No 15 The final one for the year, was logged on August 15t h at 19:14 PM. It was an 17-pulse, 3-m inute and 29-second disturbance. M ADAR had logged the best and longes t APD so far. And the background radiation reading was 39 cpm , a 100% increase? For the reco rd, th is was a significant reading? MADAR had recorded seven events in a little over a m onth. Som ething was going on. UFOs we re being seen and MADAR was working overtim e. There was another UFO case involving a train som etime in October, possibly the 21st, near Fostoria, Ohio. On this dark m orning, the engineer (who we 'll call How ard) was sitti ng in his locom otive cab on the m ain line track. It was cold and clear. Several box cars had been cut loose to th e south of the switch track to the war ehouse. Th e en gine was co upled to the rest of the cars which w ere being moved into position w ithin the warehouse. At about 3:20 AM, he saw what looked to be a shooting star to the w est, it curved down out of the north west. He was facing south and the first box car w as blocking his view. The light cam e down in the fi eld toward Rt. 23 between him and a church. Slowly, at about the speed of a walking m an, it cam e toward him across the field. It was approxim ately 16' off the ground and stopped on the ot her side of the tracks between four and five box car lengths away (180-270' ). He picked up his radio and called out to his c onductor who was about seven or eight car lengths down the track. \"Donald...com e up to the engine.\" Donald replied by radio and asked what was happening. Howard answered, \"Hey, we got a damn ed UFO up here.\" By this tine the UFO had moved to within two ca r lengths of the track. The object was \"birthday cake\" or d isc shaped, about 90' in diam eter, and 45' high. It was brightly lit, with banks o f nine vertical \"tub es\" s eparated by a dark void s pace that ref lected no lig ht. Short horizontal tubes ran over the top a nd bottom of these voids. T he bottom of the disc was like ceram ic and gray in color, with a trace of lavender. The disc was slightly tilted and rotating counter clockwise. B oth m en ti med the rotation at 9 rpm . The object glowed yellow. Electric-like energy spar ks ran around the disc in a clockwise direction. These were blue. As the arc tou ched the cen ter of th e tubes, the ends lit up. As the arc touched the ends, the centers lit up. When the men trained the cab headlight on the U FO it would light up very bright. This happened several tim es. Testing his engine, a General Mo tors Model 3900, he increased the output to 1500 am ps. The e ngine worked. The walky talkies worked, also. 70"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Twenty two m inutes late r, the ob ject star ted sp inn ing faster and faster and got as bright as it had been earlier when responding to the lightbeam signals.

(Ref.6) On the 12th of Dece mber there was a sighting fr om a comm ercial aircraft over Tennes see. It occurred at 2:25 PM, therefore a daylight sighting. There were two witnesses for this 5-m inute observation recorded by Richard Haines in his computer catalog. (Ref.7) Around Christm as of that year, perhaps a few days before, a couple had a st range encounter with a UFO near Ft. Mitchell, K entucky. The lady and he r husband were watching TV at about 1:10 AM when suddenly their living room was bathed in an eerie green glow. \"It cam e through the curtain,\" she said, \"f lashing th ree tines. \" Both she and her husband jum ped up and scurried to the win dow there to see an egg -shaped object, glowing green, about 50-100' distant in a low hove ring position. They both estim ated the object to be about 10-15' in diam eter. It was encircled by a soli d row of green flickering lights which had cast a greenish g low on its entire surface.

A few seconds later at her destination sh e saw a silver disc shaped o bject “with teacups on to p and botto m of the saucer” as large as the full m oon that was m oving forward with a yellowis h-orange trail behind it. The saucer stopped, reversed direction, and then moved forward again behind the building next to which she was parked. The trail was visible only when the object was in m otion.

A single engine Sundow ner flying from Evansville, Indiana, to Cincinnati, Ohio, encountered a UFO on a collision course approxim ately 22 miles north of Louisville, Kentucky. The Pilot, accompanied by his instructor and girlfrien d, related that he was flying at 5,500 feet when he spotted two bright lights at eye le vel at an unknown distance ahead. Suddenly, one of the lights began to move horizontally away from the other light. Then, it m ade a perfect circle and then another while rem aining at the s ame distance. Th is e rratic behavior continued for several m inutes. Then, the m oving object becam e brighter and, looking lik e a “blob”, began what appeared to the pilot to p roceed on a collision co urse with th e S undowner. As the blo b cam e closer the pilot, fearful of a collision, dove his aircraft down one thousand feet. In an instant, the white blob streaked overhead and out of view. When the aircraf t arrived at Cincinn ati the pilot called the Standiford Control Tower in Louisville, Kentucky concerning the incident. He was told that hey had no UFO confi rmed by radar but they had received calls from people in the area who had seen a UFO.

This sightin g is the on e with the greatest num ber of witnesses. The UFO also appears to have been briefly seen on radar. If this even t was a hoa x, it was an unprecedented elaborate one. The total duration of this sighting was 45 m inutes. Most witnesses saw a large red light dropping flare like objects. One witness who was directly underneath the object saw strange strobe like light s encircled by rows of red lights rotating like a turntable.

The objects were large and oval and appeared to be about f ifty to one hundred feet in diam eter with round dom es that had what appeared to be round dom es all around. The object on the right started to dim and we nt out. The object on the left started to dim out also. Then, th e object on the right brightened up and shot over the northern horizon. The other object followed suit. It was five m inutes after the objects departed before the natural sounds of th e night returned. Gary' s brother, who was traveling in a car five m iles north of their lo cation, said that he too saw the lights at the sam e time but, to him , the lights were in the sou th. The total duration of this sighting was fifteen m inutes. (Ref 5) September 10, 1978: At 8:30 PM a sighting from an aircraft occurred near Springfield, Missouri. Richard Renne, a 30-year-old physicist, was flying southeast in his sing le engine Beechcraft Bonanza (N7311B) at a true air spee d of 170 knots, when he caught si ght of a yellowish white light descending f rom 15,000 feet at his 4:30 or 5:00 o'clock position. Renne wa s flying at 9,500 feet seventy-five to one hundred m iles southeast of Springf ield, Missouri, enroute to W alnut Ridge, Arkansas. “Why didn' t the Center (Mem phis ARTC) ca ll about this traffic,” he thought. He radioed them and wa s told that they had no traffic. The light then descended below his tail at the 4:00 o' clock position and he looked to his left to watch it em erge from be hind th e tail. It did not em erge from behind the tail. He saw it again at his 3:00 o' clock position , then back to 4:00 o' clock, then back to 3:00 o' clock again. “If I turned, it held.” At one ti me it was between him and the lights of Springfield but he still could not see its shap e. Suddenly, it ascended to twenty to twenty-five t housand feet “in a snap” on a perfectly straight traj ectory. Then, it flew in an odd \"step function\" to his 1:00 o' clock position in two seconds. Then, back to his 3:00 o'clock position one m ore tim e where it rose above the clouds. Then, another errati c light dropped from a high altit ude and moved erratically while changing colors until it shot off into th e heavens at his 2:00 o' clock position. The witness subsequently learned th at a total of eight UFO sighting cl aims were f iled by pilots with the Mem phis ARTC that night. Renne, him self, h eard a com mercial jet out of St. Louis report a sighting. Renne was flying above a haze layer that ex tended up to 9,000 feet. The air was clear at his altitud e. The visibility was five to seven m iles in the h aze itse lf. (Ref 6) December 1 6, 1978: At 8:30 PM an interesting sighting took place in the vicin ity of Abington, Indiana. The five witnesses were in an autom obile when a dark object abo ut three tim es the size of the m oon cam e over the nearby low trees and hovered over their car causing its m otor and radio to stop. As it hovered in front of the car three red lights and a large white lit on the rear were seen. T he object departed with a “whooshing” sound. (Ref 4) December 1 978: On an unknown date two teenage girls from London Mills, Illinois, reported a tubular aircraft that approached th eir car as they drove on Illinois Rout e 116 near Rapatee, Illinois, at night.

If anyone would have told m e about this sighting, I would have been p olite about it, investigated it, a nd fou nd a place to privately sh ake m y head in am azem ent. These thing s are not sup posed to happen but, this tim e, it did. It was very dark at 5:00 PM and it w as about time to head for hom e after a hard days work. Right before quitting tim e I got a call from Byron Koeni g, a good friend of m ine who was also one of my FIs.

Five m inutes before quitting tim e at 5:00 PM m y wi fe and I went outside to try to get a look at the object. W e thought that after identif ying it we w ould get in the car and go hom e, but it didn' t work out that way. The bright light we saw in the no rth west was not a star or a planet. It was too bright and it was m oving. All six of us that were there watched as the object approached us while it descended very slowly. An aircraft must fly fast enough to generate enough lift over its wings to stay in the a ir o r it will stall o ut and f all o ut of the sky . This objec t was m oving so slowly th at we all agreed that it could not be an aircraft. Then, we saw a pair of lights. W hat we thought had happened was the “jet” had been further away than we th ought and had its 200,000 ca ndlepow er landing lights turned on. T hen, when it got close enough to us we could actually resolve the two lights. The object still cam e toward us very slowly. Som ething about it was just not right. After fifteen minutes, far to long for the object to have been a ny type of jumbo jet or conventional airplane, the object cam e in to our vicin ity. It was still descending all the tim e as if we ha d a landing field at Mr. Vernon. The airport is tw enty-five m iles northeast at Evansville, Indiana. At ten m inutes after five o' clock the object was not a few hundred feet above the ground and it looked like it was following Highway 62.

My theory is that certain im portan t UFO activ ities occ ur at certain tim es and MADAR is a witness to those activitie s. The lack of correlation of the MADAR events to local sighting reports most likely m eans that reports are not being f iled by witness es. It app ear s that the ty pes of activ ities that are occu rring when MADAR is activ ated are the CE3 UFO and hum anoid and the CE4 abduction incidents. The correlation is circum stantial but there is no co rrelation at all with Nocturnal Light, Daylight Disc, CE1, or CE2 incidents.

A JSLX is a moving, very bright , strobing light that is definitely not an aircraft.

At 10:40 PM I saw a bright, silver white light in the northeast. It was strobing at one tim e per second. There was no detectable aircraft lighting around the strobing light as required by the FAA, there was no sound, and the light was moving at a fair rate of speed. I m entioned to the two others present that we had a “bogey” in the northeast and all began to wa tch the light through binoculars. Even through the binoculars no FAA required lighting was detectable. The strobing light m oved from northeast to southw est passing alm ost overhead at about 45 degrees. No sound was heard. W hen the light got in the s outhwest about 45 degrees up in the sky, it stopped and reversed its course and headed back north eas t.

He said that the size of the object would be sam e as a pickup truck located at treetop level o ver the tree , but he believes that the UFO was farther away than the tree. It' s possible that the UFO was indeed ov er the tree when he saw it and not farther away as he believes. Since his neighbors said they never saw it, the tr ee m ay have blocked thei r view, which would be unlikely if the object were farther aw ay. Later, the witness m entio ned a couple of curious things that had been om itted when he was first interviewed. He said that the light from the UFO was round but with a quarter of it m issing.

The total num ber of objects invo lved was on e to five. Th e activity to ok place of an approxim ately two-week period with incidents occurring during that tim e that were ho urs in duration. Som e incidents were low-level activity and there was one apparent landing. The objects were observe d with the naked eye and with binoculars. Mr. XXX also reported that a m ysterious fog woul d com e in during the evening hours and he and Pa m would wake up to discover m issing tim e and other strange happenings. Mr. XXX stated that these incident s were reported to CUFOS at the tim e and, again according to Mr. XXX, CUFOS was supposed to send som eone b ut they never did. Mr. XXX was scheduled to be released fro m pr ison on a work release program on 09/17/86. In the fall of 1986, he was transferred to a halfway house and one night he wa s taken to the Encore Dinner Theater in E vansville, Indiana. It just so happe ned that m y son, Brian, and his friend, Scott, were working as bus boys there at the time and they overheard Mr. XXX' s conversation about UFOs. I have always considered their ove rhearing the conversation as a littl e strange. My son suggested the Mr. XXX call m e concerning the incidents and gave him m y phone num ber. Mr. XXX was surprised at the suggestion and said that he had called m e in August and that he wanted very m uch to get in contact with m e when he got out of prison on a w ork release in Febr uary. Both Brian and Scott were im pressed with his story and with the m anner and sincerity with which it was told. Mr. XXX beca me very excited and nervous when he discussed the incidents and felt com pelled to tell som eone who may be able to help him understand what the incide nts were all about. His ex-wife was a waitress at the Dinner T heater and she was nervous about discussi ng the incidents. It was obvious that she didn' t like to talk about it. On February 3rd, 1987, Mr. XXX called and asked if I rem embered him . He was then out on work release. He was supposed to be released in Septem ber but he had just gotten out that day. He gave me his address and phon e num ber. He wanted to be gin work on the cas e. He adm itted he had read UFO m aterial. He had done drugs but was not on dr ugs at the tim e of the incidents. H e went to prison for selling drugs. He repeated his story about contacting MUF ON i n Chicago and said that a young sounding lady had talked to him and told him that a field investigator would com e to see him the very next day. Mr. X XX's impression was that sh e acted as if she alrea dy knew all the answers to his questions. 83"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"The area where the alleged incide nts took place was west of Ford Road on Middle Mt.

CHAPTER 10: THE SAVAH CASE I first heard of what came to be known as the Savah Case at 8:45 PM on October 16, 1985 when I got a phone call from a m an who sounded very troubl ed and concerned and who was very cautious. The incident that prom pted the phone ca ll allegedly occurred on Nove mber 17, 1984. The caller h ad read an article that ap peared in the newspaper during National UFO Infor mation Week that had m entioned MUFON a nd m yself. His first comment on the phone was “ Why do you have an in terest?” I told him that m y inte rest was hard to explain but that I had been obsessed with the subject since high school. He qui ckly replied, “So am I. I can tell you why I am obsessed with it.” Thus began m y involvem ent in the investigati on one of the m ost interesting, confusing and tim e consum ing cases I have ever com e upon. The caller said that on Novem ber 17, 1984 he and a male companion had been out looking for Indian artifacts near the W abash River when a UFO cam e up from down the river to ten feet overhead. Although the duration of the sightin g was only about a m inute to a m inute and one half , considerable tim e was m issing. The caller asked that I contact hi m on Friday, October 18th to schedule an on site investigation for the following day. The weather was bad on Saturday, O ctober 19th, so we canceled the on site investigation and I sent him a sighting report form, For m 1, to com plete and return to m e. 84"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"On Monday, October 21st, I received the com pleted Fo rm 1 t ogether with a sketch of the object. According to the com pleted Form 1 there was some evidence of E-M effects and also som e psychological physiological effects so I asked the witness to com plete Form s 3 and 5. He also said that he would supply a topographical m ap of the ar ea of the sighting. I recei ved the com pleted Form s 3 and 5 and the prom ised topographical m ap on October 28th. On Nove mber 8th I attempted to contact “Carl”, the second witness. He wasn' t available but his sister told me that she didn' t know a nything about the alleged incident. Appa rently, this witness had not even told his own fam ily about the sighting. On Nove mber 12th I sent a typed report of the inci dent along with copies of the com pleted form s 1, 3, and 5, and the topographical m ap and sketch to W alt Andrus, Budd Hopkins, and my assistant, Jerry Sievers. The original caller, also the prim ary witness, requested anonym ity so I' ll call him “John”. The second witness, John' s com panion, also anonym ous, I' ll call “Carl”. On Nove mber 17, 1984, John, 30 years old, and his m ale com panion, Carl, 31 year s old, were hunting for Indi an artifacts on a cool, clear day. T he area where they were looking is in the W abash River bottom s near Savah, a very sm all far ming community near Mt. V ernon, Indiana. The area is about 7.5 miles northwest of Mt. Vernon and twenty m iles west of Evansville, Indian a. To the west of the area, across the river is southern Illinois. It was a Saturday morn ing and they had arri ved at about 8:45 AM. Carl found a hole in the ground and called John to com e and see it. As they searched the two m en had split up. It was burial site. Under hypnosis Carl said, “There' s no footprints. There' s no dirt. I' m going to stay away from it. Leave it alone. Don' t bother it!” He described the hole as four foot by four foot. The bones in the hole we re “finger bones, big bones.” The men were discussing the burial plot when they heard what sounded like a bunch of bees nearby. Then, they thought the sound m ight be that of a boat becau se they were very clos e to the winding W abash River. The buzzing sound was rhythm ic similar to a m otorboat. John saw an object low on the horizon com ing down the river toward them . The object was disc shaped, grayish silver and m irror like in appearance. It m oved fas t toward them, stoppe d overhead for about thirty seconds, and then departed. Origina lly, Carl sa id tha t the ob ject cam e f rom th e north going south down th e river, it saw them and turned east and headed fast toward them . They were approxim ately two hundred yards from the river in a plowed field about f ive hundred acres in size. Tracing th e flight of the object on the topographical m ap supplied by the prim ary witness s howed that it actually made a flight pattern resem bling a box. The actual path of the UFO was nor thwest to southeast, then southeast, then northeas t, an d then the o bject d eparted heading n orthwest. The witness describ ed th e elevation o f the object as low on the horizon at first and then com ing to ten feet directly overhead. On depa rture, the elevation increased to about one-quarter of the way up on the horizon. The object itself was described as “big as a house” and “thirty feet wide.” The sketch of the object supplied by the prim ary witness sug gests th at it was large r. 85"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" Exhibit 4H The object b ecam e “invisible” when overhead bu t still cast a shadow on the ground. During the thir ty secon ds or m ore that the ob jec t was overh ead, the witnesses describe d the feeling of static electricity around them . Their hair stood on end. The buzzing sound, which pulsed at about two tim es per second, was still h eard wh en the object was overhead and “inv isible”. When the object was overhead the witnesses tried to m ove out from under it but were unable to do so. The object was not seen by the w itnesses to move away on the northeas t leg of its box flight patte rn beca use it was s till “invisible ”. It r eappea red in the no rtheas t startling som e crows which took flight from a tree line before it headed back in the direction from wh ich it had com e. After the object d eparted the witn esses s tayed in the area f or what they perceived to be a short tim e and then drove back to Mt. Vernon, approxim ately a twen ty-m inute casual drive from their location. They arrived in Mt. Vernon to discover that they had approxim ately ei ght to ten hours of missing tim e! Since the in cidence o ccurred th e prim ary witness has had recurring nightm ares of being taken “up into a dark area” and b eing confined “in a glass cont ainer.” H e says that h is experience doesn' t scare him , consciously, that is, but his m ale com panion, Carl, is very upset by his own personal experience. Relevant data from the Form 1 includes the fact that John had a B. A. degree and was working on his Master' s Degree at the tim e of th e sighting. He was self-employed as a contract designer. He wore contact lenses and his vision was excellent and his hearing was good at the tim e of the encounter. His ability to recall past inform ation and to ca rry on a good conversation was excellent except when it cam e to th e day of the inciden t. He showed som e degree of confusion when recalling and discussing the incident. John told m e that during the approach of the objec t from down the river and also on the departure, the object moved very slowly. It, however, m oved very fast while covering the two-hundred-yard distance from the river to their lo cation. On the Form 1 he circled “ap peared transparent” referring to the overhead portion of the even t. On the Form 3 John checked static electricity as th e cause of their hair sta nding on end. He said that his eyes watered and h is eardrum s and f illings in hi s te eth vib rated du ring the even t. Since the ev ent he has becom e more interested in physic phenom ena. 86"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"On the Form 5, he reiterated som ething that he had previously told m e during our m any telephone conversations. During and after the experience he had a f eeling of curiosity a nd a wonderful feeling of calm ness. He used calmness to also describe the “air” durin g the even t. Even norm al noises such as those of birds, etc., were not noticed just before and during the sight ing. He also m entioned a “tran ce like state” that th ey were in when the object was overhead and a personality change and a feeling tha t this was a so mewhat religious experience afterward. I still had questions concerning th e in cident after I received the com pleted form s so on Novem ber 13th I called John and clarified som e of the inform ation. There had been a general disagreem ent between the two witnesses, he said, about the m issing time. They had started out early in the day but m ost it wa s lost in, in their term , “lim bo”. John thought that they had lost about two and one-half hours. Carl thought that it was m ore like six hours. The data suggests that it was m ore than six hours. The day of the incident was clear and cool, a bout 40-45 degrees, with a slight wind. John saw the object several seconds before it m oved overhead. He heard the buzzing before Carl heard it. The object was described as f ive to eight f eet thick, thirty to fifty feet wide, dark gray or black in color, and shiny like a m irror finish. The tim e to zoom approxim ately two hundred yards from the river to overhead was extrem ely short. At this point John could see the round shadow of the object on th e ground but despite looking up and all around h e could not see the ob ject because it wa s invisib le. The object was apparently overhead for thirty seconds to one m inute. W hile it was ove rhead the hair of the witnesses stood on end and flopped around. John saw the shadow on the ground m ove toward the tree line where the crows w ere startled from the trees. It was daylight and a clear shadow was visib le. C arl was aware that som ething was over their heads but he never saw the object of the shadow. After the object left, both m en were in shock a nd sat down on the ground for a while. At the tim e John though that it was about 2:00 P M. I took som e tim e for them to walk to the van wher e they sat and looked at each other for about ten minutes. It m ay have be en thirty to f orty-five m inut es after the sighting before they actua lly lef t the area. They both asked each other the sam e ques tion: “W hat the hell was that? ” John f elt very relaxed. Carl was troubled by the experience and is still troubled today. A ccording to John, Carl vom ited and had a severe headache. It was begi nning to get dark and by the tim e they got to Highway 69 near Solitude, it was dark. Thus, the men arrived in the area in the early morning twiligh t and lef t the a rea in the ev ening twiligh t. Carl went through a lot of changes since the tim e of the sighting and he had a lot of problem s. John, in contrast, seem ed to benefit from it. John had nightm ares of being “taken up into the da rk,” but he felt that he had gotten som ething of value out of the experien ce. W hether real o r im agined, he said he could see the “old m an” passing away and see other things such as his getting a good job. He even suggested to som eone in the oil business where he felt that there was oil. Core samples were subsequently taken and som e very successful oil wells were drilled at Richland. On Nove mber 15, 1985, I again spoke with J ohn on the phone. During the conversation he mentioned that Carl was bothered quite a bit by thei r experience. John' s tone of voice indicated that 87"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"he was very worried about a bad situation that was affecting his long time friend. Paraphrasing John' s comm ents, he said that “it (the experience) was really bothering him (Carl).” H e (Carl) hasn' t been the sam e since the sighting. H is divorce was blam ed on the sighting and he was having som e very bad nightm ares. “It (Carl' s experience) was a very bad incident, opposite to m e,” John said. Carl even threatened John on one occasion becaus e John had told m e about the incident. Recently, things were starting to get better for Carl. John said th at Carl wan ted to talk bu t not on the telephone. H e wanted to talk face to face. I was a little reluctant to get toge ther with the two m en, let alone take them to a rem ote site without a few of my c omrades along. Due to bad weather we w ould not be able to visit the area of the sighting for som e time. Two days later John called again and said, again, that Carl was afraid to talk over the phone and that he wanted to m eet in person. A tentative date for the m eeting was set for the following Sunday but for m undane reasons we were unable to m eet at that tim e. On January 25, 1986, I tried to contac t Carl. I called his hom e but he wasn' t there. John and I had talked on the phone earlier in the day. John had again m entioned the grayish black, m irror like object. He said that the actual tim e period that he plainly saw the object was for five to ten seconds before it got overhead and then neither of the m en saw it. He m entioned a sk in rash that looked like red, dot like boils that Carl had gotten on his chest after the incide nt. Carl had reportedly gone to a derm atologist and the rash had di sap peared after a year o r so. I forwarded Form s 1 and 5 to Carl and I received the com pleted for ms on the third of February. Finally, about 4:45 PM on February fifth, I m anaged to speak with Ca rl on the telephone. He said that he thought that the tim e and date of the event was wrong. They had made num erous trips to the area and a y ear had pass ed so it was difficult to say for sure as far as he was concerned. He said that he was affected m ore than John by the event and re membered very little of it except that when the event was over he was very upset. I suggested to him that we m eet in person very soon and that he consider undergoing hypnotic regre ssion in the very near future. On February 7, 1986, I drafted a written accoun t of Ca rl's report of the sig hting. This report, written before any regressions were done, conflicted with John' s account of the incident and it lacked th e visual s ighting data. It was subm itted on Februa ry 10th but was not publish ed. This rep ort is presented below for the record: The witness, Carl, was 3 1 at the tim e. He is an el ectrician by trade. Carl' s report sta tes that it was mid Nove mber (established as the S aturday imme diately preceding Thanks giving, i.e., Nove mber 17th) around m idm orning. The sky was clear. The te mperature was 40-45 degrees with only a slight wind. The wind direction was not recalled. They were about 200 yards from the W abash River which was to the west o f them and from where the source of the even t cam e. The two m en were separated by a m oderate distance of about fifty yards. Carl' s report gave Solitude as the location; however , it was th e little f arm ing community of Savah which is to the west of Solitude. The m en were looking for arrowheads. What first caught Carl' s attention was the sound. He heard the buzzing which he described as a “swarm of bees.” When asked what he though it was, he reported, “at first, a boat because we were by the Wabash River.” His reaction, he said, was “scared , then curious, then (after) confused, because it s eem ed like 45 seconds but it was hours later.” W hen it cam e to describing the actual object and its actions, Carl said, “I couldn' t see it---but I heard and 'felt' it directly above m e. It just hovered there.” Later, he told m e: “Som ething was directly above John and I that day, m aking m y eye s water and a pulsating hum sound for approxim ately 45 88"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"seconds.” In the shadow the m en experienced seve ral strange effects. Th eir hair stood on end and was whipped around as the buzzing sound increased in loudness, pul sing at two tim es per second. The tem perature in the shadow, which should have been cooler, was about ten degrees warm er. The object overhead that was creating the shadow was i nvisib le. N oises in the area s eem ed depressed o r considerably less, except for the buzzing. Both m en experienced tem porary paralysis. C arl never saw the object, even on its departure. “I sensed th e (object' s) departure to the northeas t,” h e said. The Form 5 that Carl had com pleted noted the eff ects of the encounter. He reported an electrical affect or goose flesh during the overhead portion of the encounter. He also reported “thinking im paired and dream s” afterward, al ong with a serious personality ch ange that lasted about a year. Carl said that he even had problem s rem embering th ings, bo th little things a nd im portant things such as where he left a too l, etc. During th e event h is eyes watered and he becam e paralyzed. His eyes watered after the ev ent, also. He had a rash th at a ppeared on his ches t after the event. The rash las ted about a year and he had just assum ed that it resu lted from contam ination from entering an Indian burial site in Uniontown, Kentucky. The rash was de scribed as large, rou nd, splotches, four in num ber about one-half inch in diam eter. The splotc hes were flat, not raised. These appeared about mid chest, were brown in color, and were reporte d not to itch or be irritated. I asked him about nosebleeds and he said that he had no problem s in that area. On August 12, 1986, John called m e concern ing a recen t article by Stev e Kinney which appeared in the Evansville Courier . The article m entioned the Savah case and our upcom ing state MUFON meeting. John asked what was going on at the site of his encounter a nd I didn' t know what he m eant. He said a couple of F-4 aircraft had flown ve ry low over the area and had swooped down below the ridge. He said that he and Carl c ould plainly see the pilot' s helm ets. John also mentioned that Carl wanted to m eet w ith m e at a secluded apartm ent in Booneville. He said, “He' s really gone inside.” Carl, apparently, was still not the sam e person that he had been before the event. W ith the MUFON m eeting occurring in just a few days it was not possible to have the m eeting at that tim e. During the conversation, John also passed on som e ne w inform ation. He said that when the object or shadow left the area, th e pulsing sound speeded up. For the record, John was obsessed with the idea of working with m irrors to m ake a hom e in the forest inv isible. He thin ks the UFO was invisib le at one po int becaus e of its extrem ely reflective, mirror like s urface. 89"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" Exhibit 3H On August 16th our state MUFON m eeting was held in conjunction with National UF O Infor mation Week.

W hen they arrived I m ade sure that their presence wasn' t announced to the m edia representatives who were there for the opening press conference.

Present at the session were Byron Koenig, the m otivational hypnotis t, L ee S ilen and m yself. The session was audio taped. Three days later we conducted the second regression se ssion with John and videotaped it. The regression sessions verif ied the previous verb al testim ony and brought out a lot of em otion; especially fear. John had no recoll ection of being onboard a craft. A week later, on Nove mber 16, 1986, we conducted an onsite investigation. On the 21st we conducted the firs t and only regression session with Carl as the subject. He rem embered nothing af ter the inciden t began, but he verif ied the previous ly subm itted data in cluding finding the Indian burial spot and seeing the extrem ely tall skeleton. On February 7, 1987, John cam e by and dropped off a dr awing he had made of the object when it was near him (exhibit 3H). It was different from hi s original sketch of th e object as it was com ing toward them (exhib it 4H ). The m ore recen t sketch a ttem pted to explain so me of the mysteries he h ad observed during the overhead portion of the event. J ohn felt that the clear sky was reflected off of a “m irrored cone” that m ay have been a “force field” rath er th an the solid b ottom surface of the craft. EPILOG In summ ation, we conducted severa l hypnotic regressions on the two m en. Later, m y team visited the site of the encounter. Carl' s m other and fa mily were of the Pentecostal faith and greatly influenced his story. They told him that he was po ssessed an d that the de vil was invo lved in a ll th is. He did, in fact, try to commit suicide several times. Once, he wrote m e a letter saying that John had made up the entire story. Later on he told m e that his fam ily pressured him into saying that. There are a lot of sim ilarities be tween the even ts in this case and other abduction reports. I believe that these m en told m e what they be lieved to be th e truth. John told m e later that Carl was crying and vom iting after the incident and that he had to lite rally c arry h im to the van . If we ignore the abduction im plications, this ca se is a good daylight sighting of an unknown object by at least one witness. It m ay have been an at tempted abduction that w as som ehow aborted but the report of m issing tim e indicates that it m ay not have been aborted at all. The rules for reporting scientific da ta are very strict. This case doe s not pass the tes t as eviden ce to present to the scientific comm unity. Both of these m en had drug problem s. They were honest about their problem and never tried to con ceal it. They even had th eir therap ists at a drug rehabilitation center call m e and confirm that they had had an encounter. They sim ply had an experience with which they could not deal. W ho, if not som eone in the UFO investigation f ield, would have listened to them and their uncann y story ? Sin ce they were n't able to recall what happened on board the craf t even under hypnosis, who would listen? I think that you, the reader, if you m et these men w ould be as im pressed with them as I am and you would also appreciate and sym pathize with them fo r the situation in which they found them selves. In a sad note, Carl again tried to com mit suicide. John' s wife finally left him and took his children with her. 92"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11: 1985, ANOTHER SLOW YEAR In the region, there were only 15 entries on com puter, but one was a clos e encounter and possible Radar Visua l! This occurred at Riverview, Missouri, on Marc h 14th. This one cam e into UFOFC from Barbara Becker of the UFO Rese arch Network. A lady driv ing a car saw three light s, two of which \"went out\". The other light turned into red and white blinking lights on a boom erang shaped craft which passed directly over her, and then pretty m uch stayed in one p lace from 7:13 PM to 8:15 PM. The other two lights/craft flew over the area from we st to east. The \"m other ship\" changed from white to red, then started blinking while it receded into the west. Other objects fo llowed and disappeared by 8:29 PM. The m ain object had com e as close as 700' to the witness. However, Air Route Traffic Control was f aintly pa inting two stationary targets, m aking this a possible RV. The M TI (Moving Target Indicator) m ode was \"on\" and stationary targets should not have been painted. Objects had faint engine sounds and were observed for over an hour. On the 18th of June, Jerry Sievers called m e . On t he day before, two persons had seen the elusive \"black tr ian gle\" a t Luck y Point. This tim e at 11:00 PM. They saw it for about a m inute. Later on in the summ er, Jerry had another report for m e. This sigh ting was a close encounter with another triangle, but this tim e observed at Lafayette, Indiana, on August 3rd. A couple was driving east of bypass 52 com ing from the west side of Lafa yette, w hen they saw an object in the east, low on the horizon. The m an saw it first. The object apparently was sta tionary or m oving very slowly away from them , because they appeared to app roach it and pass directly u nder it durin g the 45 minutes in sight. By the tim e they reached it, it was about the size of a pa per dollar at arm' s length, shaped like a triangle with the th ree corners \"squ ared off\". The colo r was blackish to a slate gray and it had three lights on it. T he triangle wasn' t an equila teral. It had one sm all end. The object was less than 200' from the ground. Too long in sight to be a conventional aircraft, there was no other explanation. The high strangeness com es in once ag ain: These people were credible, but nobody else reported the thing! On August 28th we had a rash of sightings of stra nge aircraft near here and into Kentucky. I saw a flight of these low-flying jets, m yself. Fort Cam pbell, Kentucky confirm ed th at a flight of a C-5A Galaxy and som e C-130 Hercules tr ansports had been cleared fo r night visual training. The spokesm an s aid they were not cleared for anythi ng below 1,500' , howeve r. W hat I saw was right \"on the deck\". And what I saw was a flight of A-10' s, \"tank killers.\" Is that confusing or what? These spokesm an always have an answer , but I believe the A-10' s were pa rt of the support for a special night operation. No m ystery, just confusion. Case closed. The year ended with an observati on of a rectang ular ob ject at Vi ncennes, Indiana. Jerry Sievers called m e the next day and filed this report. At a quarter to one on the m orning of the 18th of October, a lady reported she saw a dark gray object like a \"cracker box\" with very bright lights on each end.

Jerry Sievers, 58 m iles north of m e at Vincennes, who had been supportiv e for 25 years, becam e my Assistan t State Directo r. The com put er listed 36 cases for the region, Indiana with 25. One third of the total sightings were close encounters. Things were picking up. January 7th. The year started with a sighting on January 7th, at 2:00 P M. It occurred in southw est Indiana. A lady was driving south on Hwy 41 with he r husband and saw a dull black aircraft with no markings. The object allegedly cam e right in front of their car. The craft ca me within 20-30' from west to east, cut its engines, banked, the red flam e stopping and black sm oke followed. The engine had a roar and the duration of observation was a litt le over 2-m inutes. If the range and the report is correct, this is a serious FAA violation. Probable aircraft, possi bly som ething else. W e'll never know. Nobody said it would be easy. (Ref.1) January 12th , 5:00 PM. Valparaiso, Indiana: This case invo lved what ap peared to be a 12' diam eter disc observed for 10-seconds. No sound was noticed and the object reportedly was less than 180' off the ground most of the tim e, and at one tim e actually lower. It appeared to be a vehicle/device and passed overhead, acco rding to th e witness. (Exh ibit 11) I had to investigate this case by m ail and telepho ne. The site was up near Chicago in Lake County, Indiana, a little too far to travel and I had no FI' s up there, at leas t yet. Later, in January of 1989, I assigned a new FI, Michael Rigg to th e case for follow-up. T hanks to Mike, an excellent artist, w e have som e great drawings to go with it.

It was desc ribed as pyram id shaped with red and blue lights near th e \"altitude\" of th e triangle and corners. Th e area of the sighting was listed as suburban, near a lake. Sky was clear. The object appe ared at first to be at about 8,000' up and larger than a house at the sam e distance. Best range estim ated at 6,000' . The m ain reason the witness decided to report th e sighting was that the object looked strange: a shape, with dots of lights, that m aneuvered, circle d a radio tower at very high speed. \"It wasn' t a regular craft. It seem ed so high up, you know, when you look at a plane so high up, you can tell it' s sm all?

A m an, his 14- year old son, and a neighbor boy (about the sam e ag e), were fishing. Late that afternoon they saw an oblong object which th ey thought was the Good year B lim p. This object was at l00-1 50' altitude, had portal windows on the upper half and lights on the bottom half. The only sound they heard was on departure, w hen it sounded like a \"vacuum cleaner \". The sighting portion lasted about 45-seconds, too short for the Goodyear blim p. The description doe sn' t m atch, either. L ater, they found that they had \"m issing tim e\" and had been abducted. The last I heard, Budd Hopkins was working the abduction part of the case. The story about the Corydon sightings begins here near Crandall, chronologi cally, but it would be awhile before trouble would be brewing and our sour ces of UFO infor mation in that southeast corner of Indiana would be literally cut o ff. It wasn' t Hopkins' fault. CE-4' s are his expertise and he' s a heck of a lot better at it than we are. And it takes money, which has always been a problem in UFOlogy. We didn' t have it, he did. The problem ca me from a m an using a phony last na me. He wanted to write a book about abductees and I wouldn' t give him the nam es of witnesses in th e state of Indiana. In e ssence, I/we prom ised to protect these people from the prying eyes of the public and the press. It was his belief that we regressed these people, brought out the \"truth\", then left them hanging! When I wouldn' t do what he asked, he told the people at Corydon that MU FON worked for the governm ent and I don' t know what else.

In an article in the CORYDON DEM OCRAT (June 16th) it states that he was on duty the first tim e he saw the lights. He got a call on the evening of Marc h 9 from Mickey Shawler about strange lights in the sky. That first n ight, at Shawler' s place sou theast of Corydon, he saw \"12 different objects,\" very bright, just over the tree li ne. The sightings by Mr. Hamm (and Mickey Shawler) started on March 9th at 10:30 PM EST and som e of the lights he ob served were visible off and on for about 4-hours. The objects were first observed by looking out of a window at a resi dence (Shawler' s) near Corydon. The attention was called by Mrs. Shawler. Mr . H amm did not know what the lights were. He expressed, \"at first disbelief, then intrigue.\" Describing the objects, he stated that they were brigh t lights and there was one sighting involv ing a quick descent. They lost si ght of the objects at daylight. Objects firs t seen in the northeas t, last seen in th e north, m oved from north to east. First seen low at 1/4 elevation, last seen at 3/4. At one point the objects (lights) were reported at approxim ately 250' range. Objects were in front of and passed behind trees at range 1/2 m ile, suggesting very low elevations at tim es. Distance above ground was unknow n. Also in the area were aircraft before, during, and after the sighting. No sound was heard or reported from these objects.

This event of 17/18 March is the subject of this particular report. This CE-1, witnessed by three observers (one being Deput y Sheriff Steve Ha mm ) took place in the early m orning hours of 18 March. Ms. Shawler said there w ere four lights seen in the sky over the tr eeline, hovering. T he largest object was orange in color with three sm all white li ghts above it and a red and green one on the bottom side. About four m onths ago she had first noticed the strange li ghts. At that tim e she summoned police, but no one res ponded to the call. On Tuesday, 17 March at 2330 hours EST, Ms. Shaw ler saw the objects again. The orange lights were hovering above the field which faces northea st and the treeline beyo nd. At no tim e was any noise whatsoever heard. She said the larger orange ball hovered and then m aneuvered and the sm aller white ligh ts see med to be \"'swallowed\" up and disap peared. Officer Stev e Hamm of the Harrison County Sheriff's Departm ent responded to Ms. Shawler' s call within five m inutes. Officer Haa m confirm ed her story of seeing UFOs and hear ing no sounds. During his sighting he said that there were as m any as twelve lights seen. For alm ost the next two hours Hamm and Mickey Sh awler followed the objects in the police cruiser. At one point the UFO was chasing the police car alternating slowly down and speeding up. Ms. Shawler described it as \"playing with us\". Officer Haam said he was joine d at the site by off-duty jailer Randy Fessel, who also saw the objects and de scribed them as \"a mazing, like nothing I' ve ever seen before, a large object with lights flashing around it.\" Officer Hamm said one of the objects seem ed to be righ t at the top of the tr ees with in 200 or so yards of hi m. He and Fessel shined a spotligh t at the UFO and its lights vanished and the object was gone in a s econd, join ing two others in the distance. Hamm is a veteran of nine years as a police officer and ha s never seen anything like UFOs befor e. Sheriff Ed Davis, Jr. seem ed to dow nplay the incident, stati ng that there was probably a logical explanation, but Ha mm and Fessel both stand by what they saw. Ha mm believes that there is a larger object with sm aller ones nearby. Both he and Ms. Shawler say the UFOs seem to have the ability to hover, spin and go from bright to di m. The only tim e Officer Ha mm ever heard a sound was a sligh t whine af ter he put the sp otligh t on th e objec t.

Part of the event which lasted approxim ately 5-10 m inutes, a 1.5 m inute segm ent was videotaped. As a result of intense NL activity in the Corydon area, we had conducted a fi eld test of our Rapid Deploym ent Group that particular ev ening. After our initia l investigation with many witnesses, w e proceeded to an area wh ere th ese NL' s were bei ng observed. We observed a jet aircraft com ing from the west, and I requested that a camcorder be used to gauge resolution. T here were four lights on the jet. A few m inut es later, at approxim ately 9:30 PM, an object described as brilliant orange, suddenly materialized in the south-southwest. The s uddenness and the brilliant orange, flare-like characteristics were unmistakably unusual. The elevation of the object was approxim ately 20-25 degrees at the beginning of the sigh ting. The object appeared to be an orange headlight and appeared to be either hovering or moving towa rd the witnesses. At one point there was a rapid descent to the lef t, all the tim e the brilliance va ried only sligh tly . Several tim es the light winked complete ly out, only to \"flare up\" again. After about 5-8 m inutes, the object went into a flat west to east flight m ode at a relatively slow rate of speed at an elevation of 10-15 degrees.

He looked out of his bedroom window to notice five objects, 1-1/2 to 2 feet in diam eter \"floating\" approxim ately 5-6 feet away from the window and about 6-7 feet off the ground. Som ewhat scared, he watched the objects change from white discs to \"big bubbles\" with pulsing blue lights com ing from within the objects.

That' s exactly what it looked like, a big shiny saucer flying upside do wn across the sky.\" It didn' t do anything fancy, it just flew over and kept on going till it was out of sight.\" (Ref.2) \"Red Buttons\", the com edian, was famous for sayi ng, \"Strange things are happening...\" W ell, some very strange things continue to happen even in lean years. This one still bugs m e. On June 29th I attended a baseball gam e my son Br andon (then 12) participated in. I was sitting in the outs ide b leachers, facing south. A num ber of peopl e were shading th eir eyes look ing \"up\". It was 8:19 PM and still very much da ylight outside. Moving north to southeast on a curve and at a moderate altitude was som ething that looked OK at firs t. The best way to descri be it was an ordinary aircraft at first glance. T he \"m ind\" never \"flagg ed\" this one as unusual w hile we watched AT ALL? After it was all over, it was like we had been hyp notized, and now awake we couldn' t believe what we had just seen. Picture a slende r ju mbo jet lik e the old \"747 \" with a jet f ighter stuck on the nose? It looked like it was pushing the sm aller jet, but it was obviously part of the m ain craft. If it was making any noise on the curving north to southeas t pass it couldn' t be detected very well. There might have been a slight roar, I really don' t know. These ball gam es are very noisy. It was in sight only about a m inute or less, la st seen in the southeast. When I got hom e I drew the sketch. This wasn' t a hang glider. It was too bi g for that. And if it was what it app eared, th ere s hould have been a lo t of noise. Can I guess the altitud e? It was higher than an ultra light and lower than a regular jet. It wa s probably at a light plane altitude. Bu t it was larg e 143"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"and slender, much m ore slender th an a \"747\" was. And I have to c onfess.

The second tim e wa s when the extrem ely slow light that took 25 m inutes to descend turned into what appeared to be a low-flying jet right over the highway, twenty-five miles from the airpo rt. T hese th ings are not supposed to happen, but they do and they did. I liked it better wh en we were dealing with flying saucers. Most of us now agree that there is so me for m of deception in volved in all this UFO business. Not only from the governm ent, but from the phenomenon its elf. Abductees speak of seeing a \"deer\" in a forest only to find that under hypnosis, that \"deer\" was actually a hum anoid being and that they had been abducted. As Richard Hall stated in a recen t video from the Fund for UFO Research, m aybe even the \"Nordics \", the talle r, m uscular bu ilt b lue-eyed be ings are ac tually \"scre en im ages\" of sm aller aliens. That would m ean that Travis Walton had been escorted out of the ship by a \"friendlier\" being than the ones he enc ountered earlier in the exam ining room .

When we capture and \"tag\" an animal, we m ean it no harm . In fact, we are concerned about its ability to resist extinctio n. I realize that it is m uch m ore co mplicated than that, but the abduction story is far from being as clear as m any would s uggest. Almost everyone agr ees that deception is part of the phenom enon. Is this to protect us ? Or is it to deceive for som e other purpose? 144"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"If you are a newcom er to UFOlogy, you need the hist ory lesson to see the whole picture. The UFO story is not all about extraterre strial kidnappings by bug-eyed crea tures. UFOs, structured nuts & bolts m achines, have been around for quite a while. They' ve been picked up on radar and chased by military jets, seen by m ilitary and civ ilian pilo ts, as well as civilians on th e ground, an d even photographed They leave indenta tions on the ground, break off tree branches, and have actually interfered with auto ignition syst em s and stopped trains.

T he UFO ope ration is a m ighty one and has im plications for m ankind beyond m ere contact w ith stellar neighbors. Our very existence m ay be at stake, not because ET wants to con sum e us or replace u s, but becaus e Man m ay still want to rem ain unique and alone in the universe. Just what E T m ay be doing m ay be as diverse as what we all do every day. There would be young ETs, adult E Ts, and old & wiser ETs.

So, for those who are the experts, and those who are new at U FOlogy, and those that have sim ply forgotten why we got in volved in all this in the fi rst place, here is som e sobering h istory provided by the Regional Sighting Inform ation Database. The earliest item listed on com puter for the region is Septem ber, 1888. It is a very brief report because we do not have the newspap er article for th e details. However, this alleged ly occurred at Diam ond Island, Illinois, and m ay ha ve been a Clos e Encounter of the Third Kind. Som e of the CE- 3's listed in the EGBA ( George Eberhart' s Geobi bliography Of Anomalies) are actually hum anoid reports (HR) since a UF O has to be involved and, in m any cases, was not. (Ref.1) Out of over 4,000 UFO sightings on the RSID, about 6% occurred in the region in 1897! Most of these were h oaxes created BY newspapers to SE LL newspapers. There was one sighting in Indiana, however, that appears to be a close encounter with aliens in 1897, a CE-3. Bear in m ind, these early cases are very difficult, if not im possible, to veri fy. However, the purpose here is to show som e of the earliest reported close encount er cases listed in the region. On April 14, 1897, an object reportedly landed 2 km south of Gas City, Indian a, on the property of John Roush, terrifying the farm ers and causing the horses and cattle to stampede. Six occupants of 145"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"the \"ship\" cam e out and seem ed to m ake som e repa irs. Before the crowd could approach the object, it rose rapidly and flew toward the east. (Ref.2) By the turn of the centur y, som e re ports of what appeared to be genui ne UFOs started to com e in. On January 12, 1910, there was a daylight di sc sighting at Chattanooga, Tennessee. There were f our other sightings for that year, in cluding a humanoid case at E ffingha m, Illinois, exact date unknown. The first close encounter recorded on the RSID for the new century occu rred at Bowling Green, Kentucky, in the summ er of 1913. Sorry to say, ther e are no details on this case or the ones above. In 1923 there are three entries listed. One is a CE-1 at Indianapolis, Indian a, a Nocturnal Light at Greencas tle, Indiana, an d the CE-1 at Rend City, Il linois, below. The exact m onth and date of the latter is unknown. Veral Lage r lived in Rend City, Il linois. He was sitting on the front porch of his home when he observed an object, which he firs t thought was a falling star, as it seem ed to be \"com ing down\" fro m the north. Then it hovered, m oved below the southern horizon, then reappear ed and moved to its original position. The object was cigar-shaped and so bright, a news paper could be read from its light. Mr. Lager and his grandm other watched the object for 30 m inutes before it m oved toward a swa mp and disappeared. (Ref.3) Decatur, Illinois. On an August even ing in 1930, around 7:30 PM, Mr. and Mrs. Jack H uffman and four other observers saw two white objects coming toward them , and the objects flew directly overhead. When overhead, they appeared to be about as large and of the sam e shape as the wings of a m odern airliner, but there was no body or tail. They flew side by side into the western sky, suddenly m ade a sharp 90-degree turn toward the south and disappeared from sight. (Ref.4) In 1941 there was a CE-1 reported at Clev eland, Ohio, and a CE-2 at Middletown. There were som e sightings of dist ant objects or lights every y ear afte r that during the early forties. And then, in 1947, all hell broke loose! References 1. Geobibliography of Anom alies, page 557, Eberhart. 2. Passport To Magonia, Vallee. 3. Skylook, No. 57, page 12. 4. Skylook, No. 66, page 15. CHAPTER 19: THE FIRST WAVE - 1947 1947 - A MASSIVE UFO WAVE In the summer of 1947, people all over the United St ates began reporting flyi ng saucers. In fact, about half of the reports were OF flying discs obs erved in broad daylight. The RSID lists only four close encounters for the region, but the U. S. had over 888 sightings in six weeks. 146"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"I could devote a whole chapter to the W ave of 1947 and the R oswell, New Mexico, UFO crash. However, the 1947 wave dealt with mostly distant sightings. The m idwe st region had m ore than its share of activity during those six weeks. The repo rt you are about to read deals with special UFO cases, close encounters, pilot sightin gs and radar cases in our region. And the Roswell crash, the single m ost im portant ev ent of the century, occurred in New Mexico, not the m idwest. Suffice it to say, a UFO (or possibly two) crashed, practically next door to the 509th Bom b Group, the only A-Bo mb group in the world at the tim e. One of t he possibilities for the massive sighting wave in the summ er of 1947 may ha ve been the discovery of a m ajor threat. The massive action taken against that th reat could have created a possible danger in itself, the danger of collision. It is also possible, but not very pr obable, that we shot down a UFO in July of 1947. The m ost civilized natio n of 150 trib es on Plan et Earth dropp ed two atomic bom bs, killing 200,00 0 people, m ostly civ ilians. How it was perceived b y an advanced race, on e that understood us very little at the tim e, is not known. In 1947, we were working on m issile delivery system s for bigger atom ic weapons. During the m assive wave that lasted only six weeks, a UFO crashed! The crash of a genuine U FO and its recovery is borne out in the testim ony of over 600 prim ary and secondary w itnesses. The subsequent cover-up be gan, and has worked m agnificently ever since. On Septem ber 23rd, a letter was sent from Gen. Nathan Twining (ATIC) to Comm anding General, U.S. Air Force, concluding that UFOs were real, disklike objects and recomm ending a detailed study. 1948 - A FAMOUS SIGHTING F ROM AN AIRCRAFT Som e aren' t aware of it. Som e ha ve forgotten it. Others think it wa s explained away. For the record, here is the Mante ll ca se. It was January 7th. At 1:15 PM th at afternoon the contro l tower operators at Godm an AFB, outside Louisville, Kentucky, received a ph one call from the Kentucky State Highway Patro l. The patrol wanted to know if Godm an Tower knew anything a bout any unusual aircraft in the vicinity. Several people from Maysville, a sm all town 80 m iles eas t of Louisville, had reported seeing a strange aircraft. Twenty m inutes later th e state police called again. T his tim e people from Owensboro and Irvington, west of Louisville, were reporting a st range craft. The townspeople had described the object to the state police as bei ng \"circular, about 250-300' in diam eter\", and m oving westward at a \"pretty good clip\". (Ref.1) At least twenty official UFO inci dents have been logged on the RSID for that one day for the region. But, literally hundreds of people saw som ething unusual over a very large area that day. Fourteen official entries were for the state of Kent ucky, alone, which incl uded the Mant ell case. At 1:45 PM Godm an Tower m ade vi sual con tact with the ob ject. And at 2:30 PM, Captain Thom as Mantell becam e involved. He and three wingm en fl ying F-51 Mustangs cam e in from the south, one wingm en low on fuel landed. Captain Mantell and thei r three F-51' s were put on an intercept course for the UFO. Mantell was the only pilot to see the UFO at about 2: 45 PM and went after it. He was reportedly killed while chasing a \"flying sauc er\" when his Mustang cr ashed near Fort Knox (actually, F ranklin, Kentucky). It was thought that he had \"blacked out\" due to anoxia when he had reportedly clim bed to 30,000 feet without oxygen in an attempt to intercept the UFO. The F-51 then went into a spiral dive and disint egrated. There has been a lot of controversy a bout this incident and 147"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"there isn' t en ough space here to p resent all the ev idence, but h e reported som ething \"large and metallic\" an d \"trem endous in size\" just before radio contact ceased.

Skyhook balloons were 100' in diam eter, had average sp eeds of 175 mph and reache d altitud es of 13.2 miles. And th e Venus answer for this daylight si ghting was ridiculous.

And nowhere in the records could anyone find the launch of a skyhook balloon for that tim e and location! If their had b een a laun ch, ev en a secret one, there would have been a record of it. But it was never provided because it didn' t exist. Hundreds of witnesses from Kentucky and Ohio observed an unusual craf t in the sky. Am ong the witnesses w ere police of ficers, m ilita ry pilo ts, a irport con trol tower oper ators and rank ing m ilitary officers, all of whom are f amiliar with the planet Venus and ball oons, but were una ble to identify this object. Dr. J. Allen Hynek (then an Air Force consultant to the UFO project) had studied the case and he found that the sam e object had been seen sim ultaneously at Madisonvill e, Elizabethtown and Lexington, nearly 100 m iles from For t Knox, a few m inutes after the F-51 had crashed. In other words, the object had been seen at the sa me tim e in three locations 175 m iles apart! Observers in the Lockbourne cont rol tower (Ohio ) estim ated the sp eed of one object at m ore than 500 m ph and reported that they were watching it for no less than twen ty m inutes. In twenty m inutes an object traveling 500 mph can cover a distance of about 175 m iles! (Ref.2) On January 22, the Air F orce Project, \"Sign\" was officially established. The RSID shows a CE-1 at Indianapolis, at 9:55 AM. The source of the repor t is Project Blue Book Special Report 14. Nowhere in the report is th e location given. Two m en were driving across a bridge when they saw an object glide across the ro ad a few hundred feet of them . It was shiny and metallic in construction, about 6-8' lo ng and 2' wi de. It was in a flat glide path at an altitud e of about 30' and in a moderate turn to the left. It was s een f or only a few seconds and apparently went down in a wooded area, although no trace of it was found. (Ref.3) And on July 31st, there was another good sighting at Indy. T his was a morning (8:25 AM) Daylight Disc sightin g, not a CE-1, but worth y of inclusio n because of the detail a nd the fact it was illus trated in an Air Fo rce report.

They had called the operations office of the Ohio Air National Guard at th e airpo rt and a pilo t was running tow ard an F-51, dragging his parachute, helm et, and oxygen m ask. The tower ops called ATIC (Air Technical Intellig ence Center) and told th em where to look. They also had it, an extrem ely bright light, much brighter and larger th an a star. (This was mid-m orning, now!) It was pretty high because thick, high, scattered clouds every once in a while blanked it ou t. While ATIC was watching, som ebody ran in and called th e radar facility at W right Flight to see if they were \"on the air\". T hey weren' t, but they sa id they could get operationa l in a hurry. They said they would search SE of the field and suggested, th at ATIC send som e people over. By the tim e the ATIC people arrived the radar was up and running and had a target right where the light was! The radar was also picking up the Air Guard F-51 and an F-51 had been scrambled from Wright- Patterson. Both pilots could see the UFO and we re going after it. The m aster sergeant who was operating the radar called the F-51' s on the radio, got them together and started to vector them toward the target. W hen they reached 15,000' , the clouds m oved in and they lost it. T o be safe, the jets decided to spread out to keep from runni ng into one another and go up through the clouds.

It was 8:25 P M and Goshen, Indiana. A Trans World Airways DC-3 was heading west. The pilot was Captain Robert Adickes, an ex-Navy pilot with 10-years experience with TWA. The co pilot was Robert F. Ma nning, a four stripe captain who was acting as first officer on this flight to Chicago. The DC-3, Flight 117, w as cruising at 2,000' whe n a strange red glow below and behind the airliner caught Manning' s attention. Moving swiftly, it cl imbed up on the right, overtaking the plane. The red light was too bright for a wingtip light . The DC-3 was cruising at 175 m ph, but the light overtook it rapidly, growing in size. It was now an orange-red color, like a round blob of hot m etal sweeping through the night air. He as ked his co-pilot to take a look at it. Over the top of the object, its bottom half in shadow, could be seen the s cattered ground lights and cars m oving on the highway. Adickes called the ATC, but they ha d no record of any craft near them . It was now parallel with the DC-3 and m atched th eir every move.

At 1:43 P M a CAA employee at Hul man Municipal Airport was walking across the ramp in front of the adm inistration bui lding. His peripheral vision picked up a flash of som ething on the southeastern ho rizon. W hen he looked for the cause he couldn' t find anything. Then he saw a pinpoint of light (this is afternoon, m ind you). In a s econd or two the pinpoint grew larger and it was obvious that som ething reflective was approaching the airport at terrific speed. It grew larg er and larg er and then flas hed overhea d so fast he was am azed that he h adn' t called anybody to com e out of the nearby hanger and look. But he realized that the UFO had been in sight for only 15 seconds and had passed from horizon to horizon. It was shaped like a \"flattened tennis ball\", was a bright silver color, and w hen it was d irectly overh ead it was \"the size of a 50-cent p iece held at arm' s length.\" A m atter of m inutes later a pilot radioed Terre H aute th at he had seen a UF O. He was flying from Greencastle, Indiana to P aris, Illinois, when just east of Paris he' d looked back and to his left. There, level with his airplane at 5,000' and fairly close, was a large silvery object, \"like a flattened orange\", hanging m otionless in the sky. He lo oked at it a few seconds, then ha uled his plane ar ound in a tight left bank.

UFO activity started on February 13th, tim e not liste d, at Granite City, Illinoi s. According to a once- secret Air F orce report (Project Blue Book Speci al Report 6, page 101) a \"Radar Bomb Scoring Group observed unusual radar returns while attempti ng to score bom b run (SECRET)\". Speed: High up to 1090 mph. Altitud e: 30,000 feet. Heading : varied. Sou rce: Radar crew. (Ref.l) March, 2:30 PM, Kirksville, Miss ouri. This pilot was flying for TW A. One day in March 1952 he, his copilot, and a third person who was either a pilot deadheading hom e or another crew m ember, were flying a C-54 cargo plane fr om Chicago to Kansas City. At about 2:30 PM the pilot was checking in with the CAA at Kirksv ille flying 500' on top of a solid overcast. W hile he was talking, he glanced at his No. 2 engine, which had been losi ng oil. D irectly in line with it, and a few degrees above, he saw a silvery, disc-shape d object. It was too far out to ge t a really good look at it, yet it was close enough to able definite ly to m ake out the shape. The UFO held its re lativ e position with th e C-54 f or five or six m inutes, then the pilot decided to do a little on-the-spot invest igating him self. He started a gradual turn toward the UFO and for about 30 seconds he was getting closer, but then the UFO began to m ake a left turn. It had apparently slowed down because they were still closing on it. About this tim e the copilot decided the UFO was a balloon; it just looked as if the UFO was turning. The pilot agreed halfway - and since the com pany wa sn' t paying them to intercept balloons, they got back on the ir course to Kansas City. They f lew on for a f ew more m inutes with \"th e darn th ing\" still 153"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"off to their left. If it was a balloon, th ey should be leaving it b ehind, the p ilot recalled thinking to him self; if they m ade a 45-degree right turn, the \"balloon\" shouldn' t stay off the left wing; it should drop way behind. So they m ade a 45-degree right turn, and although the \"balloon\" dropped back a little bit, it didn' t drop back far e nough to be a balloon. It seem ed to put on speed to try to m ake a turn outs ide of the C-54's turn. The pilot continu ed on around until h e'd made a tight 360-degree turn, and the UFO had followed, st aying outside. They could not j udge its speed, not knowing how far away it was, but to follow even a C-54 around in a 360 and to stay outside all the tim e m akes a mighty speedy object. This shot the balloon theory righ t in the head. A fter the 360 the UF O seem ed to be losing altitude. The pilot opted for a better look. He asked for fu ll power on all four engi nes, clim bed several thousand feet, and again turned into the UFO. He put the C-54 in a long glide, headed directly toward it. As they closed in, the UFO lost altitude a little f aster and \"sa nk\" into the top of the overcast. Just as the C-54 flashed acro ss that spot, the crew saw it ris e up out of the overcast off their right wing and began to clim b so fast that in several seconds it was out of sight. Total tim e in sight: 16 m inutes. (Ref.2) April 14, 6:34 PM, Memphis, Tennessee.

One of those was the Vincennes incident, which occurred in the m orning at 10:38 AM. Then there was a Sharonville, Ohio, evening sighting, which was an NL and is listed as a possible UFO. And then another daylight sigh ting at Cincinn ati. Of pri me interest to m e was the othe r two cases. One was a Radar/Visu al. I had first heard of these in the 60' s when I had read Major Donald Keyhoe' s book, FLYING SAUCERS FROM OUTER SPACE.

About this sam e time the strange m achine was seen from the ground by several civilians near Bellefontaine. It appeared to be round, with a shiny, m etallic gleam . When the blips cam e on the scope, two F-86 jets were about ten m iles from the UFO, on a GCI problem . The two pilots, Major Jam es B. Sm ith and Lieutenant Donald J He mer, were imm ediately vectored to ward the UFO. As Sm ith and He mer reached 30,000 feet, they saw a bright, round, glowing object m aneuvering above them . To m ake certain it was not a ground reflection, both pilots changed course, circled, clim bed, to view it f rom dif ferent an gles. The UFO' s appear ance did no t change. Pos itiv e it was a solid object, both pilots switched on thei r gun cam eras and clim bed at full power. At 40,000 feet the m ysterious dev ice was still abo ve them . Pulling up at a s harp angle, Major Sm ith tried to get a picture. But his F-86 stalled and fe ll off.

(Hem er's radar sight was \"caged\" - inoperative - so he saw no radar blips. ) F rom the range of his radar set, Major Sm ith knew the unknown device m ust be between 12,000 and 20,000 feet above him to cause such a weak blip. To confirm his estim ate he quickly checked with his telescopic gunsight and found it just covered the UFO. But before he could ge t a better look, the m achine quickly accelerated, di sappearing at a trem endous speed. Later, using the radar and optical sight data, Sm ith carefu lly calculated the UFO' s size. Apparently, it had been one of the m edium -sized types. If it had be en 12,000 feet above him , then it was about 24 feet in diam eter. If it was at 20,000 feet, its di am eter was not less than 40 feet.

They were watching a circul ar thing w hich hung motionless in the sky an estim ated 200- 300' overhead. Both Gilh am and his neighbor guessed that it was not less than thirty or m ore than forty feet in diam eter. None of the little group of witnesses heard any sound from it, not even the buzzing oftentim es reported. When brilliant beam s of bright bl ue light began projecting downward from the center of the object, the fam ily across the road decided it was tim e to reti re. Mrs. Gilham suggested that they, too, should get back inside the house. Mr. Gilham laughed and told her to \"take the kids and go on inside. I want to see this th ing!\" He stood there under the object for a total of about te n m inutes, in the recurrent blue beam s of blue light, each o f which lasted about half a second. Th en, he said, \"The thing m ade a sizzling, lik e a high speed electric m otor, and away it wen t?\" That was on a W ednesday night. He felt no discom fort on Thursday, but by Friday he had eye inflamm ation and his face was beginning to swell a nd to itch. By Saturday the top of his head and his face were showing s uch unm istakable swelling and redd ening that h e went to a d octor. Dr. Joseph Dukes sent him to a hospital in Sullivan, I ndiana, f or trea tm ent. He was tre ated there and released a few days later afte r being interrogated by Air Force officers who advised him not to discuss the m atter with civilians. Fortunately they were too late. Dr. Joseph Dukes of Dugger, Indian a, told the FI (Frank Edwards) that the burns Gilham suffered were sim ilar to the burns caused by overexposure to the rays from an electric welding torch. Gilham contended that he had not been near a welding to rch for three weeks nor for that m atter, anything else that could have caused burns, ex cept that blinking light on the UFO.

All of th e other 150,000 som e-odd cases were rated below it! For a long tim e that was the best and highest num ber we could com e up with. But everyone pretty well agreed that the Socorro cas e was at least one of the very best we had. With the docum entation we now have concerning the Roswell crash, it appears we now have one case th at outranks them all. Thanks to Kevin Randl e, Don Schm itt, Stanto n Friedm an, and others, we now have, apparently, a case where at least one UFO was occupied by living creatures from som ewhere else, whether that be an other planet or another dim ension. My 34 years of investigation and research were w orth th e effort. But once we establish that there is som ething real out there, and m anne d by alien bei ngs, the rest of the repo rts, including the one hundred year plus history, begins to m ake even more sense. And there' s more to it than just abductions. \"They\" appear to be do ing all the things we would do if we we re in the sam e situation. In all probability, m en and wom en and young adults , doing all kinds of round- the-clock scientific work. This would include younger aliens doing fiel d work, collecting soil, plant, and anim al sam ples, just as our children and college students do today. What we understand less is the abduction pheno menon. Is it what it seems to be? Are we being deceived, o r are we to take all th is at face value? And as the Sa vah abductors \"m entioned\" throug h one of the abductees during regression, \"You have som ething we need. We have som ething you need!\" One thing is for sure. The world will never be the sam e. W e're not alone. Francis L. R idge 174"}]
