When Barbara Marciniak and I met in 1988, we had both ju st begun an exciting ne w phase of our lives: I had moved to Michigan to birth a new magazine, Connecting Link, with publishers Barrie and Susie Konicov, and Barbara was birthing the Pleiadian channelings. Af ter years of working many and varied j obs while traveling, searching, and studying consciousnessexpanding material, we had created fo r ourselves work that encompassed who we were and what we believed, and we were excited about it. During the next two years, Barbar a and I traveled to many expos, pl ayed a lot with the Pleiadian teachings, and generally had a great time with all of it. We talked about doing a book of the Pleiadian teachings but never really pushed it; the book would come when it was time. The year 1990, the beginning of the \"unnamed decade,\" came. Connecting Link was getting well established, and Barbara ha d made some three hundred tapes with the Pleiadians. I felt it was time fo r me to move back to New York, wh ere I could continue to do the maga zine on my computer as well as do more networking. I also felt it was time to do the book. When I thought of \"the book,\" I imagined that the Pleiadians would dictate it to me and that I would simply transcribe the tapes, edit the material, and ther e it would be. It would take no particular effort and very little time out of my pre ssing magazine schedule. So, in May, when Barbara and I sat down to do a \"book channelin g ,\" I was q uite sur p rised to hear the Pleiadians' idea of how to do the book."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The Pleiadians assured me that th ey would not dictate th e book to me and that I would have to pull it together through my own process. I was intrigued. They said to me, \"If this book was just given to you, you would be an employee. What effort would it be of yours? It is going to be a birthing of something for you, a birthing of process in yourself that is a whole new way of ut ilizing creativity.\" Phew! \"OK, so, how do I do this miracul ous process?\" I asked. \"Where do I begin?\" They answered, \"You are going to piece this together using your intuition only. This is not at all to be a logical-mind project. By using your intuition, you will be guided and te sted to see if you can perform and complete a project without your logical mind knowing the steps that are coming next. It will be a tremendous exercise for you. It will lift you into a much higher place of consciousness, a higher place o f order, and a higher place of trust. When it is completed and is ve ry successful, you will say, 'I don't know how I did it. I have no idea.' \"The story will show that if yo u can clear people of th eir personal information, they can go cosmic. The p rocess that you will be going through during th e next few moons will be very intense for you. You will go through the process of an initia tion yourself as you write it. You have some mastering to achieve in a few areas during the next six moons, a nd all of this is tied together.\" They said that I was to listen to the tapes and transcribe only the pieces that I felt would go into the b ook. Barbara's sister, Karen, would intuit what tape s had good information on them and send them to me. Also, my friend Marsha would get impulses on which tapes needed to be included. Then it would be up to me to pick out the parts to use. I was instru cted to use no order and not to even think how they would fit together. I could use a one - to five-word code and a bit of color on each page to categorize the information, and that was it. I began to grasp the idea. My logical mind had one more question. I asked the Pleaidians, \"Should we attempt to find a publisher before the book is completed, or at least announce that we are doing the book?\" The Pleiadians replied, \"Ideally, yes, you will send out the announcement that you are beginning the b ook. The first time that you sit down to work on it, clear your desk top and have no clutter o r disorganization around you. Have a clean space, with your crystal stones that will assist you. Then you can make a prayer of intenti on by saying, 'I am now announcing th at I am beginning a book, and I am sending this announcement out to anyone who is a pub lisher and to anyone who is involved in bringing this data into publication for those whom it will serve best . It is my intention th at the person to publish this book discover me and be brought to me, and I promise that I will be av ailable for that recognition. I understand that I have very little to do with this. That part is not mine. I understand that I am to b roadcast the announcement like I am sending out th e birth announcement and that a response will be sent to me. In this I trust.' That is it; it will be brought to you. \"Remember that the process you will be going through is very much a part of the stor y, because you will discover something of yourself; then the story will be told in the terms that you put together. You will understand the importance of the book because you will have had an experience as you create for others a pathway into reality based upon juggling your realit y and allowing different sentences and contexts to b e juggled through you and made in to a new order. Someone who di d not trust would find this very difficult. Trusting is the absolute ke y. There is nothing else that you can turn to in this process. This is about commitment, and you are going to learn that you can commit to who you are, th at you will not screw up, that you will always be provided for and th at never will you be left wi thout. It will always all work out accordin g to y our intentions."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"\"Your part in this is to intend wh at you want and to simp ly let the data flow. Th e book will make its own order as you learn about your self during the process and as you code certain information. It will be mind blowing what you experience.\" As I now read the words they said to me then, I ge t a whole different picture than I did at the time. I realize now that they mentioned se veral times that doing this book was going to be an initiation for me, that I would be tested, a nd that people would need to clear thei r personal information in order to go cosmic. Now I know - what those word s mean; at the time, I had no idea. My personal issues started coming up big time. I didn't trust myself, I didn't love myself, and, in fact, 1 didn't really know who I was - I couldn't separate the r eal me from the facade. I began a series of deep- tissue bodywork sessions that brought up more stuff-memories from childhood that I'd blocked out, trauma and pain stored in my body. I was a mess. I was in no shape to work on the book, for I was barely managing to get the magazine out every two months as it was. In October, I went to Egypt with the Pleiadians. I knew this trip was going to be an important turning p oint in my life, and I t hought it would kick me into high gear so I could get to work and pump out the b ook. It was a wonderful trip, a powerf ul trip, and it flattened me like a board. It blew open my circuits and awakened areas in myself that I had no idea were there, many of them dark and ugly. When I got b ack to New York, I was definitely not capable of beginning the book and, in fact, I wasn't sure I would ever be able to do it. The only thing I knew for sure at that time was that I had to move out of New York. I couldrit get centered or clear there and I fe lt bombarded with energy. I felt naked and exposed walking on the streets, and I couldn't use the subway anymore. It was t ime to get out. That December, I moved to North Carolina. When something is right, it works out beautifully. Libby, one of the friends I met in Egypt, lived in a rural area south of Ra leigh, and I knew I wanted to live there. I made an intention that I would have a house to move into be fore I came down there. I pictured what it would be like and what the land would look like, and Li bby said she would keep her eyes and ears open. About a week before my move, my curre nt landlord walked into Libby's shop and started complaining because her tenant wa s moving out with no not ice. Libby said, \"That' s because it's Tera's house!\" I drove down from New York the following week with all my belongings and moved in. The house was j ust what I wante d -roomy, with lots of light, and on 175 acres of land. It was perfect! The minute I got there, I began healing. I lay on the ground or sat with my back to a tr ee and just let nature heal me. Healing myself was all I focused on. In January, when I went to Michigan to typeset the thirteenth issue of Conrtectino Link, I realized that my time with the magazine eras finished. I had grown a lot doing it, and now it was time for me to move on to something else-what something else I didn't know, but when I get these knowings I have to go with them. When I came back home, I spent a fe w days asking myself if I'd been a total fool to give up a job when I now lived out in the mi ddle of the country and didn't know wh ere I would get a nother one. Then I realized it was perfect that I ha d no job: it was time to do the book. I began listening to the tapes and transcribing bits and pieces of them. The work went smoothly and easily, and things seemed to be flowin g . I didn't q uestion the order or attem p t to make one. I j ust let ever y thin g flow throu g h me."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"During this time, the Pleiadians di d a series of daytime classes for a few people in order to catapult us out of our issues. The classes were called \"Firing Codes of Consciousness,\" and th at's exactly what they did. I got to deeper levels of the issues I thought I'd finished with in New York. Those of us in the classes cleared much emotional ba ggage and developed a very tight bond with each other. The series ended with a rebirthing that was one of the most powerful experiences in my life. I had another \"book reading\" with the Pleiadians in which they talked about the Bringers of the Dawn making the cosmic evolutionary l eap in awareness possible by anchor ing the frequency first inside o f their own bodies. Suddenly, an awareness hit me: I ha dn't been able to do the book in 1990 when we had first talked about it because I hadn't been able to hold the frequency vet; I hadn't been cleared out enough to do it. I asked the Pleiadians about this. \"You did not trust yourself, Miss Te ra. l\"ou told everyone you did, but you did not really even like yourself. You compared yourself, and you were not hone st with what was really going on kith you, and p eople very close to you were mirroring this for you. You had to go deeper, as everyone must go deepe r into the layers, for everyone has laye rs of self-hatred and dislike. Y ou had to explore certain behaviors you had that did not work and discover the reasons for them, and that disc overy brought you to be a Keeper of Frequency. This is why th e book was given to you the way it was- b ecause you had to have a major breakthrough in consciousne ss. By hashing over and translating much material that you would not even use, you went through a proce ss of a direct relationship with us. You heard over and over again, in a neutral way, all of the things that you needed to directly apply to your self if you did not wish to be left behind. And, you did it.\" Then they told me that I had transcribed enough mate rial and that the book was r eady to be put together. I had no concept of how this could be done. Was I to re ad all of the pages at on ce and see where they fit together? I had some pages with only a few senten ces on them and other lengthy excerpts of several p ages. How was I to put it in to some sort of order? The Pleiadians said that every night when I was going to sleep I was to gi ve them one minute and visualize the cover of Bringers of the Dawn. I was to play with this and change the artwork every night if I wished. I was just to look at the cover, ope n the book and begin reading the pages, and then go to sleep. The information would be show n to me in the dream state. They said I w ould begin to pull the b ook into existence by reading a book th at already existed in the future . They said it would be no wor k for me-that they would do all the work. Well, why not? The first week didn't go so well. I was doing the visualizatio n before I went to sl eep, but when I woke up I would panic looking at all the page s, and my logical mind would frantically attemp t to read them all to make some sort of order. It was completely frustrating. Finally, one afternoon, as I was sitting in the middle of the floor in my office surrounded by papers and feeling a bout ready to cry, I said, \"Hey, Pleiadians! You said you were going to do this work! I give up! Here, you do it!\" I started picking up the papers, one by one, like I w-as going to just stack there together and put them away. But I was picking up one from the left side, and then one from the right side, and then maybe one in back of me, and then one around to the left again. There was no rhyme or reason to this-no order to it. I wasn't even thinking about it, I ha s just picking them up. After gather ing about thirty pages, I suddenly stopped and looked at the stack in my hand. I got chills all over, and I said to myself, \"Oh my God, I think this is the first chapter.\" I took the pages to my desk, sat down and began reading. They fit togethe r like a puzzle. I was shocked ~ I know I believe this stuff, but still, wh en it really begins happening it's q uite amazin g . The rest of the book be g an fallin g to g ether effortlessl y , to use a favorite Pleiadian word."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"I had another \"book reading' and told the Pleiadia ns how pleased I was with the new process and how much fun it was. They said, \"It is the beginning of receiving direct guidance in how to do things. The more you say, 'I relinquish control, I don't know how to do this,' the more the energy will come in. As you get out of your own way, it wi ll become easier and easier. All you need to do is intend. The more intending you do, the easier it will become. Later on, when the book is put together and many ask you how you did it, we want you to say that this is the proce ss you used. We want you to verify ou r teachings as you were able to receive them by dem onstrating that you believe what we are telling you. \"Remember how long it has taken you to grasp the process fully. We are not lectur ing you-we are guiding you through this, pul ling you back, reflecting back to you over and over again so that you can understand where the power of operation is. It is th rough clear intention-through acting as if, and then simply receiving continuously.\" The rest of the book just fell into place, and, true to their word, the Pleiadians found us a publishe r without Barbara or me doing a nything. Of course, they hooked us up with Barbara Hand Clow-who b etter to understand how to get the material out to the public? And her ex cellent guidance brought me through a rewrite and a polish of the book that turned it from just another channeled book into something really wonderful. The Pleiadians were ri ght. When I look at this book, I don't know how it happened. I didn't design it, p lan it, conceive of it, or make an order of it. All I did was trust and allow them to work through me. It was a wonderful experience, and one that has cha nged my life. I have learned how to work with nonphysicals, and I will never agai n set out to work on any projec t alone. I'm writing an original screenplay right now, and I called in a group of experts to work wi th me on the writing and a group o f experts to work on selling it. It's phenomenal how it's working out. It's truly effortless. The Pleiadians thanked me for my work with them and my trust, and they said they wanted to compensate me and gift me with many paychecks from Spirit (paycheck s from Spirit are not like normal p aychecks that give one dollars and cents). They have gifted me with so many things. My most important gift from doing this book is myself. I now trust myself, love myself, and depend on myself, and I've opened my heart. Because of that new love of myself, I have drawn w onderful friends into my life who have become a family to me. I have heal ed relationships with my blood family, and I have drawn in a major surprise: twenty -four years ago I gave a daughter up for adop tion, and she has foun d me. She lives only two hours away from me, and we are establishing a warm and close relationship. I'm thankful she is back in my life. Another important gift has been confidence. I said I was a writer for years. I've even written for years. But not too long ago, I woke up one morning and was going over the page s of my screenplay that I'd written the night before, and I suddenly got this knowing - I am a writer! Not I'm going to he a writer - I a m a writer! Learning how to communi cate with nonphysicals has been anothe r priceless gift and has opened up many new areas to me. I'm beginning to communicate wi th animals, both domestic and wild. It's been a wonderful experience, and I reali ze that avenues of communication ha ve been opened th at I'm not even aware of yet. They are limitless. There have been many, many other gifts. The Pleiadia ns told me that the process of this book would be the most powerful teaching of my li fe, and I agree. I'm thankful that I chose myself to do it, and I'm thankful for all the love and suppor t I had from my family of friends during the process. And I'm very thankful to the Pleiadians for their love, their friendshi p , their encoura g ement, their su pp ort, and, most"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"of all, for tricking me into my own evolution.

Preface Content of „Bringers of the Dawn “, pg. xxi - xxvii, Preface. Trapped in Bali! That's exactly how I felt, as I wondered why the bureau cratic necessity of an Australian visa had never been mentioned until now. With ticke t and passport in hand and luggage on the scale, I was told I needed the document to board the flight bound fo r Darwin. My mind raced for the logic of the event and an immediate method to overrule it. I woul d will this one around! I was not new to this game and had been tested many times dur ing the last four years on my ab ility to transform and transmute obstacles into messages and to m ove with the living sym bols into a new vista of experience. Telexes were sent to the consulate in S ydney, and for the first hour's wait, I was certain I would be cleared, verified, and on my way to begin a Pleiadian teachin g tour in the land down under. I had left North Carolina a week earlier, stopped in Hawaii for a brief visit, and now, after a three-day sojourn in Bali, was rested and ready to begin the ne xt segment of a two-month odyssey. I glanced at the terminal clock and noted the slow passage of mi nutes. I was pati ently waiting fo r intentions and events to be set into motion. As time crept forward, its movement began a dawning within me that maybe, just maybe, I was no t going to get on board. Perhaps this was going to be one of those times where, intend as I might, I was not going anywhere. I could feel my body resisting this new plan and the rearrangements that potentially would have to be made be cause I could not board the plane and meet my tour schedule. It felt ominous. Damn! The eleven p.m. hour of departure had ar rived, and with ticket, passport, and tour schedule, I was told to see the local Australian consulate on Tuesday, th is being Saturday even ing and Sunday and Monday being holidays. The next flight for Darwin was scheduled for the day after I was to be there. I surrendered, located a taxi, and, luggage aboard, headed for the retreat and soli tude of the quaint seaside Balinese hotel I had left hours earlier. My room was waiting. I did not have an immediate solution to this potentially aggr avating dilemma, and knowing that , I dropped it. I moved into the p ersonal creation of comfort and trust that somehow this would all turn out fine and that if I was to be tra pp ed an y where, Bali was certainl y ideal."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The next day, as I sat by the window of my treetop room , a second dawning brought the realization that I had committed to writing a preface for Bringers of the Dawn and that I was not going to move ahea d into Australia until I was complete with that task ! Sipping Balinese coffee, I was feeling nurtured by my surroundings and the lush vegetation that framed my view. I began to contemplate where to begin and how to insert into time and space myself and this phenomenal process called the Pleiadians that through me had created a life of its own. As if haunted by a recurring dream, I have had the que stion put to me over and over again, how did it all b egin? Early on I would respond by just delineating the impulses and sequence of events that had led to my actual channeling of the Pleiad ians and stop there. Through the s eemingly endless repetition of this question, however, an energy churned restlessly in my reality, and as I kept repeating the story, I began to get glimpses of a grander view, where events a nd beginnings came from ma ny directions and multiple \"times,\" to be woven, now, into a tapestry of purpose. In childhood, I felt I was different and marked to stand out by inheri ting an older brother who was mentally retarded. His presence offered many challenges to my young mind, and our family had many lessons to learn. It was only recently that I was impulsed by the P's, as I have affectionately come to call them, to reexamine old photos from childhood and to reconsider my in terpretation of who I thought I was. Embracing this approach, this time I saw celestial -like love beaming from th e face of my dear olde r b rother, Donald, and in one photo after another the li ght seemed always to bend and illuminate him. I had not considered that I was, perh aps, blessed by his very presence. Our family shared and explored its boundaries under the infl uence of my Polish maternal grandmother, Babci, who embodied a dignity and a pride that tr anscended her earthly experience. A pioneer and p roduct of the vast European immigr ations of the early 1900s, she was drawn to the land where, she was told, the streets were pave d with gold. It was under her stabilizing influence that my two brothers, my first younger sister, a nd I played as children, exploring the ma gical land that wa s her domain. It was through her that I felt truly loved and learned to ha ve great reverence for the land and for the love o f Earth. She told us that her maiden name meant \"Star\" in Polish. T hose teachings of loving the Earth would later be echoed through the voice of my own star connection, the Pleiadians. In my teens, my so-called \"differe nce\" led me to an exploration of metaphysical ideas, and for the first time, I became excited with the di scovery that there were many interp retations of reality from which to choose. By the late 1970s, I was exploring the Seth material among other things and thereafter spent a number of years recording my dream adventures while I absorbed page upon page of Seth lore. In August of 1987-the summer of Harmonic Convergenceand again seve n months later, in March o f 1988, I experienced brief reality co llapses, where segmented and stored events from a seemingly insignificant past came screami ng forward, anxiously demanding a place of recognition. On these separate occasions, my body was ca tapulted into a state of shock, as data on UFO abductions was casually being viewed a nd shared by those around me. The first time this occurred, I somehow glossed over it, but the second time, my body was activated beyond anything I had ever experienced-or almost. Memories overwhelmed me. The pres entation of the UFO data was tappi ng into my dream file, exposing a truth that was very di fficult to assimilate. Fears before, in the early eighties, while living in Taos, New Mexico, I had had a late-night encounter in my bedroom with three bright- b lue beings. At the time, the experience se nt me into deep panic, not at all a common feeling for me. To resolv e this conflict, for 1 had no frame of refere nce around which I could fathom my own relationship and safety to this un known, I stored the event/experience in my Seth- inspired dream journals a nd left it there, an unexpl ained slice of reality that certainly wasn't a dream, thou g h for y ears it would find a secure p lace in m y p s y che with that title."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"N ow the old question resurfaced. Under what category of life's files did my personal encounter reside? Was it really real? A replay of my encounter fl ashed into my now as every cell in my body suddenly knee extraterrestrials were real. My body would never forget the meeting of the three blue beings and how they hovered over me, cal ming me from some appa rent, yet camouflaged tr auma. My intellect was on call to expand its worldview-and comprehend. I wa s challenged to live with and integrate this experience, which would open me for what was to come. The Pleiadians and I offi cially intersected realit ies a few months later in Athens, Greece, on May 18, 1988. I had been touring with a li vely metaphysical group for almost three weeks through the temple sites of Egypt and Greece. Starting with the Gr eat Pyramid, we moved through the ancient vortexes, innocent and naive as children, enth ralled by the mystery stored within the silent stones. The trip concluded with visits to the Acropolis and Delphi, a nd as we were saying our good- b yes in the hotel bar, something impulsed me with the notion to begin to channel by going to my ro om, sitting quietly, and imagining myself back in the King 's Chamber of the Great Pyramid. I recall feeling inspired by this idea-I felt it was timely and in the spirit of the trip. I proceeded to my room, and once I felt safe and secure, I sat with my spine erect an d led myself with my mind back into the King's Cham ber and the sound of many \"om-ing\" voices. To myself I said, I intend to become a clear channel nor. Within a few short minutes I felt the urge to speak, and as this urge began to express itse lf in a whispered voice dissimilar to my otan, another portion of my mind-the rational, \"in char ge\" versionbegan to question, through thought, the very voice that ryas speaking! This initial venture took great mental and psychic dexter ity on my part- b eing that I teas speaking for a heretofore unknown, dire cting questions in my mind to this unknown, and then listening to the answers so I could further dir ect the communication. After what seemed to be a half hour, the unknown announced its presence as \"the Pleiadia ns\" and left it at that. The total communi cation was no longer than one hour. The \"energies\" had been distinct and abundant, and somehow I had been thrust into a ra ther blissful union of contact-the spoken words soothing me with answers- that today I can only recollect as feelings of wis dom and peace. Upon opening my eyes I was filled with a deep sense of w onder! Could this be? I-Iad I stepped into something by following the deep-seated urgings th at originally impulsed me to join this trip at the last minute, o r had I dived too deep into the worl d of wishful illusion and dreamed it all up? What was the difference? And Pleiadians! I felt burdened by th is from the start. Who in their right mind was going to believe I was in contact with and speaking for ETs? This was almost too much for my already long-established, quietly radical self to presume. What inner turmoil my following all these impulses led to! I've since learne d to trust and honor the energies that move me, and I can now read the tale of those initial impulses in my astrological birth chart and within the Pleiadian chart as we ll. During the first month of our relationship, the P's suggested that I b egin to study astrology. Little did I know of the complexi ty and deep commitme nt to higher knowledge that this ancient science required in order to pr operly access a universal lan guage and code of purpose. The Pleiadians, in their natal chart for that day of infusion, have a sun in Taurus at 27 degrees 57 minutes. The star cluster of the Pleiades is lo cated at 28 degrees Taurus . Quite a trick indeed. Back in the early stages of gett ing to know one another, I was no t up on their tricks and the subtle methods they employed for notching my reality-I was too busy adjusting to the idea that I had contact with ETs. Our meeting and merging took practice to bring about grea ter ease, trust, and understanding. From the beginning, my sister Karen, who assisted me in the sessions, would eagerly await the appointed time when I would si t down to channel.

This behavior may appear to be the height of absu rdity to some, though t hose with experience in these realms understand that it is quite necessary to se t boundaries. It took me a good two year s to make a deep bond with them, and it came about during a body-therapy session, where a wave of Pleiadian love, like no other, engulfe d me and imprinted in my emotional body the inest imable value they held for me. I surrendered. Eventually I understood that the Pl eiadians had demonstrated their s ubtle presence in my world from day one. They became the teachers and friends I had longed for. They seemed to have a direct line on the synchronicity/impulse game th at brings people and events into being. Never having been a great investor in worry, it became quite easy for me to move into the Pleiadian moment of letting go, as they created a life of their own thr ough me. People and opportunities came from every direction. My job was to manage and be a physi cal steward for their energies. All that they taught, I was to embody-to encounter and live.

As all realities are not soli d, and as the future is not set (it is only a number of probabilities), we see an opportunity at this time to insert a more positive pr obability for Earth. We wish to reinsert light on this p lanet and restore Earth to its original purpose-that of becoming a magnificent intergalactic exchange center of information. So we have come back in a sect ion of time to a place we call a kernel or a seed in order to effect change. This change will not only affect Earth, it will affect your future, our present, and the entire universe. This is big news! You have come to Earth at a place and time when evolution is at hand. A major leap is about to take place that you came to participate in, and you are not alone, for many en ergies are coming to Earth now to participate in this great project. There are mother ships surrounding this planet that are acting as literal transducers of en ergy. There are beams of light coming to Earth from old and ancient star systems that have been work ing w-ith you for eons. These beams of information are being blasted onto the planet. As this information is being beam ed to you, your body must be able to receive it, tran sduce it, boost it, and beam it back out to others. Ma ny of you will build telepathic links with these mother ships that will be like having your m-n ra dio stations through which you will be able to tune into a wealth o f information at will. This is the evolution of super-cons ciousness, the evolution into the hi ghest aspect of your being. You do not need to worry about becoming this being, for you already are this being, and you just need to remember it. Since the veils aroun d Earth were lifted at the time of Harmonic Convergence, you have b een steadily beamed with this ener gy from the outer cosmos, and it is constantly being stepped up and increased as you are able to handle it. You are evolving now at such an extremely accelerated rate that each year of this decade will be like ten years or more from the previous century. Feel how much you will accomplish by 1999 and feel who you will be. It will be as if you have lived one hundred years in a decade. You will be flooded with memory, flooded with many other things. Many of you will take trips upon the ships to various portions of the so lar system. As you come into the Ag e of Light, worlds will open that you never knew existed. You have m oved past the other ages: the Bronze Age, the Iron Age, the Industrial Age, the Information Age, and so on. Th ese other ages had to do with seeding, planting, cultivating, and putting the potentialities of life into the third dimension. A transition is about to occur, a di mensional shift that w ill lessen the density of the third dimension so that you will move into hi gher dimensions in which the body does not have such a solid state. You have come here because you wish to master the evolutionary process and be ab le to live with it. This is going to be very exciting, because it means that you are going to functi on in many realities. Buried deep inside of you are al l the answers. The questions that come to the forefronts of your minds are arising so that you can bring th e answers from within your own bei ngs. In order to achieve this, you must first believe that the information is stored there. Humanity is learning a great lesson at this time . The lesson is, of cour se, to realize your godhood, you r connectedness with Prime Creator and with all that exists.

The majority of the extrater restrials are here for your upliftment, though there are also those who are here for other reasons. Your history moves in and out of very special ti mes. Many of you became involved on Earth eons ago through star energy and through wo rking with the higher realms. You know quite completely the difficulties that Earth has gone through, such as how many times the lands ha ve shifted and how many times help has come from the skies.

The concept behind th is method is one of the belie f p aradigms that you have come here to change. The thir d -dimensional world is one of great challenge, fo r it allows magnificent limitations to set themselves up. Through these li mitations, struct ures are formed, and through this process, you create and learn that you are a portion of Prime Creator and that Prime Creator desires experience. You are magnificentbeings, members of the Family of Light, and you came to Earth at this time on assignment to create a shift, to make a change, to assist in the transition. Love is the key. Love is what makes up the univ erse. The present technology on Eart h will only develop to a certain extent because mankind does not ve t understand that love is necessa ry. Energy can take all forms o f creativity, but when one is dealing wi th greed or hatred or any emotion that is not working toward light, one is only allowed to go so for.

Bringing bac k the concepts of light, which are information and love-w hich is creativity-is the plan. It takes renegades like the Family of Light to come into a system th at as been primarily dark for eons and change it. We are very much renegades where we are.

There is a cer tain credibility and a certain sensationalism in the way we present data.

(2) Chapter Two On Prime Creator’s Journey Content of „Bringers of the Dawn“, pg. 13 - 21, Chapter Two. Humanity is an experiment. Humanity has been desi gned, as has just about ev erything else that exists within creation. Prime Creator bega n experimenting with creation a l ong time ago in this universe fo r the purpose of greater self-explor ation, self-gratification, and self -expression. Prime Creator brought ener g ies and essences of life -extensions of itself-int o this universe and endowed those extensions with"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"the gifts that it had. It gave will ingly and freely of its capabilities . There are many other universes and many other ways of designing universes; this particul ar one was designed as a free-will zone in which all would be allowed. Prime Creator said to these extensions of itself, \"Go out and create and bring all things back to me.\" This was quite a simple assignment, was it not? In other words, Prime Creator was saying, \"I am going to gift you of myself. You go out and gift of yourselves freely so that al l you create in this universe can understand its essence as my identity.\" These extensions of Prime Creator , which we will call creator gods, went out and began to experiment with Prime Creator's energy as it existed within themselves. They be gan to create their own hierarchy, which in turn created other hierar chies. Each succeeding hierarchy crea ted another hierarchy to endow it with its own essence and to assist in the development of this universe. Eventually, in one of the galactic systems, a plan came together to de sign Earth as an intergalactic excha nge center of information. It was an incredible plan. Earth was a beautiful place, located on the fringe s of one of the galactic systems and easily reached from other galaxi es. It was close to many way por tals, the highways that exist fo r energies to travel throughout space. There was much scurrying and shuffl ing to create individual representa tion from all of the galaxies here upon this planet. Some of the crea tor gods were master geneticist s. They were able through thei r hierarchies to tie molecules togeth erencoded molecules of identity, frequency, and elec trical chargeto create life. Many sentient civiliza tions gave of their DNA to have representation of their coding upon this planet. The master geneticist s then designed various species, so me human, some animal, by playing with the varieties of DNA that the sentient civilizations contributed to make Earth into this exchange center of information, this light center, this Living Library. The plan for Earth was a grand one. The Original Planners of Earth we re members of the Family of Light , beings who worked for and were associated with an aspect of consciousness called light. Light is information. The Family of Light created the information center th ey had conceived of; they designed a place where galaxies would contribute their information and wh ere all would be able to part icipate and share their specific knowledge. Earth was to be a cosmic library, a place of incredible b eauty that experimented with how information could be stored through fre quencies and through the genetic process. Outside the structure of time,100,000 year s can pass in what may be a year within the structure of time as you know it. These creator gods did not exist in time as you know it. A fe w hundred thousand years or a million years wa s nothing to them. Different energies were brought into existence. There were species of humans on Earth perhaps 500,000 years ago who developed very highl y evolved civilizations. We are not speaking of the civilizations that you call Lemuria or Atlantis; to us , those civilizations are modern. W'e are talking about civilizations that are ancient, civilizations that are buried under some of the ice ca ps of the far southern continent of .Antarctica. The project of the Living Library on Earth was eventually fought over. It looked enticing enough to be mined by some. During Earth's early hist ory, there were w°ars in space for ownership of this planet. Have you ever wondered who owns Ea rth? It's a prime hunk of real estate. Do you think it would go ownerless in space? Skirmishes took place, and Earth became a place of duality. Certain creator gods who had the right to do whatever the y wante d - b ecause Earth is a free-wil l zone-came in and took ove r. We call this \"raidin g \""},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"the Earth. It was like corporate ra iding on Wall Street. These creator gods raided Earth approximately 300,000 years ago-the time period, historically spea king, that you would call the beginning of human civilization. This is merely the time period that you, in this present day, are ta ught was the beginning o f civilization. In actuality, it was only the beginning of the later phase , the phase of modern humanity. When this skirmish occurred, a certa in group of entities fought in space and won th e territory of Earth. These new owners did not want the native Earth specie s-the humans-to be informed of what took place. Uninformed, the species would be easier to control. Th is is why light is inform ation and darkness is lac k of information. These entities be at out light, and Earth became their territory. It gives you a new idea o f light, does it not? There was great radioactivity and nuclear action, a nd much of Earth was rent asunder. The original species, human creation, experi enced great destruction and was scattered. These new creator gods who were th e new owners were also master geneticists. They understood how to create life, and they wanted this territory for th eir own reasons. Territories are created and held by certain energies for many reasons, one of which is that there is consciousness within all things. Consciousness communicates continuousl y. Consciousness vibrates, or can be led to vibrate, at certain electromagnetic frequencies. Electromagnetic energies of consciousness can be infl uenced to vibrate in a certain way to create a source of food. Just as apples can he prepared and eate n in a variety of ways, consciousness can be prepared and ingested in a variety of ways. Some entities, in the process of th eir own evolution, began to discover that as they created life and put consciousness into things through m odulating the frequencies of forms of consciousness, they could feed themselves; they could keep themselves in char ge. They began to Figure out that this is how Prime Creator nourished itself. Prime Creat or sends out others to create an electromagne tic frequency o f consciousness as a food source for itself. The new owners of this planet had a different appetite and different preferences than the former owners. They nourished themselves with chao s and fear. These things fed them , stimulated them , and kept them in power. These new owners who came here 300,000 years ago are the magni ficent beings spoken of in you r Bible, in the Babylonian and Sumerian tablets, and in texts all over the world. They came to Earth and rearranged the native human species . They rearranged your DNA in or der to have you broadcast within a certain limited frequency band whose frequenc y could feed them and keep them in power. The original human was a magnificent being whose twelve strands of DNA were contributed by a variety of sentient civiliz ations. When the new owners came in, th ey worked in their laboratories and created versions of humans with a different DNA-the two-strande d, double-helix DNA. They took the original DNA of the human species and disassembled it. The original DNA pattern was left within the human cells, yet it was not functiona l; it was split apart, unplugged. Within human cells are light-encoded filaments, fine gossamer threads of energy that carry information. When these gossamer threads are work ing together like a cable -the way fiber optics works-they form the helix of your DNA. When you here rearranged, you were left with the double helix. Anything that was unnecessary for survival and that could keep you informed wa s unplugged, leaving you with only a double helix that would lock you into controllable, operable frequencies. A frequency fence, something like an electrical fence, was put around the-planet to control how much the fre q uencies of humans could be modulated and chan g ed. As the stor y g oes, this fre q uenc y fence"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"made it very difficult for the frequencies of light -information-to penetrate. When light frequencies w ere able to penetrate the control fence, there wa s no light to receive them. The humans' DNA was unplugged, the light-encoded filaments were no longer organized, so the creative cosmic rays that brought light did not have anythi ng to plug into and hold onto. What part do you play in this story? You are members of the Family of Light. The mere fact that you are reading this book shows that you are Family of Light. For some of you, this is just like a dream. We are reminding you of what you know inside yourselves. We have come ont o this planet to trigger you r memory banks-to inspire the human race through the band of light so that you will begin to remembe r who you are, to create your own reality, and to al ter the frequency on the pl anet and claim rightful ownership of yourselves and this territory. We, as Pleiadians, come back through time-into what would perhaps be called our past-in the vestige o f representatives of light. We come back in order to share a frequenc y with you, a frequency that each one of you has agreed to carry on this planet in order to change the DNA of the rearranged human race. This is a big story. It could make headlines, you know. The Original Planners are not about to lose the territor y. Do you think they are going to give up so easily? The Original Planners began to call on the Family of Light to go in and infiltrate the project, to incarnate one-by-one and bring the li ght-as information via cr eative cosmic rays-int o the place where it was lost. The Family of Light bega n its work here, coming into a syst em that was devoid of light and devoid of information. By mutating the laws of humanity, these creati ve cosmic rays began to pierce p eople's bodies, individual by individual, then group by group. In very small amounts throughout the eons were these frequencies of in formation brought onto this planet. At times, great battles were fought to keep out the light or informa tion that was always looking to be expressed. The Original Planners knew that, cosmically speaking, this w as a lesson for them in a llowing, in understanding the creato r gods who took their project. The Original Planners set out to in sert their own version of a plan to coincide with a time when the frequency of Earth would be altered, a time when the owners would peri sh if they could not change thei r own frequency. Emotions are a source of food. There are those whose food source is love, and the Original Planners intend to alter th e frequency of Earth to that of love. The current owners' food source of fear, anxiety, chaos, hunger, a nd despondency must be removed. Guess who is removing this food source? You are! As members of the Family of Light, you are renegades. You are systems busters, here to conquer your own fears and to show the rest of the planet that there is no reason to fear anything. You love to go in and cause trouble. You are famous, you r b ranch of the Family of Light. Y ou are famous for going into syst ems of reality and altering the frequency, thus bringing informat ion. It is not your task as me mbers of the Family of Light to p roselytize. You simply go into syst ems and act as receptacl es; you receive the creative cosmic rays into your bodies, the bodies that you occupy as humans. You are in disguise as humans, and you allow a p rocess to take place. You are coded, and as your memory begins to ri se, you will respond to the plan with which you came here to participate to alter th e frequencies. You will begin to hold, keep, and maintain a certain frequency and then to line it. Identity as frequency is the sum tota l of your physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual bodies broadcast as electronic pulsations. As you live your frequency, you affect everyone, every place you go. That is what y ou are doing now.

There are those who ha ve already receiv ed a realignment of the twelve strands of DNA, the twelve helixes. These twelve spiral strands of DNA interact with one another in the body and outside of the body. The connection of the twel ve strands means that the twelve energy or information centers can begin to function a nd send information back and forth to one another. Traditionally, seven of these cente rs are located in the body, and five are located outside of the body. They are commonly known as your chakra centers a nd are aligned with the spinning of the twelve heavenly bodies that you know of at this time within your solar system -the twelve heavenly bodies that are vibrating, as you recognize them, in 3D. These twelve he avenly bodies are spinning with information: they spin with the chakra systems that go out to the end of the universe, and they spin with the DNA spinning inside your body. When human DNA begins to rebundle as a twelve-stranded helix system and this information is acted upon, there will be incredib le power. Individuals, simply by comi ng together and jointly intending what they want-jointly becoming a telepath ic receptacle for energies from all over the cosmos-will change the face of the universe.

The universes are full of intelligent beings who have, over time, evolved and developed all sorts of capabilities and functions to serve their needs to express themselves creatively. The importance behi nd existence and consciousne ss is creativity, and creativity takes many forms. Eons ago, Earth was but a thought in the minds of gr eat beings who had set before themselves the tas k of creating new forms of existence. Many of these be ings affected the creation of this universe, and you have termed them God. In actuality, they were extraterrestrial light- b earing energies far removed from Prime Creator. We rarely use the term God with a big G. If we were to use that term, we would be referring to the entity we know as Prime Creator. Prime Creator, in its ow n personal implosion through love, endowed all things with consciousness. All th ings are Prime Creator on Prime Creator's journey. We see ourselves as an extension of Prime Cr eator-always gathering information, going off on adventures, and doing what ever we need to do to make our li ves more interesti ng and challenging so that we can feed Prime Creator. As we feed Prime Creator through our schemes and our endeavors, we endow Prime Creator with greater en ergy to give to new creations. We have never gotten close to the entity Prime Creato r. Even those of us who are beings of the grandest light vibration do not have th e capacity at this stage of our evolut ion to be in proxim ity to Prime Creator. We are not prepared enough to handle the intensity of that emanati on. It is our desire at some point in our evolution to get a glimpse of and perhaps merge with Prime Creato r for a time. We know that this is p ossible, so it is something we strive for. The evolution of consciousne ss and the ability to house information is what allows one to come into the p roximit y of Prime Creator. Man y p eo p le on Earth have felt that the y have mer g ed with God. The y ma y"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"have merged with a portion of Prime Creator that best suited th eir vibration at the time. The total vibration of Prime Creator would de stroy the physical vehicle in an in stant, because it cannot house that much information. Those that represent \"God\" to you are but a minute port ion of Prime Creator. Even Prime Creator is but a portion of something larger. Prime Creator is always discovering that it is a child of another creation and that it is in a constant proce ss of self-discovery and awareness. Remember, consciousness is within al l things, and consciousness was never i nvented, it simply was. Consciousness is knowing, and your knowing is your closest place to Prime Creator. When you trust what you know, you are activating the God within you. At this time, there is a great awaren ess moving over the planet as to how big the world really is and as to who's who in the world ballgame: not only who's w ho in the world ballgame, but who's who in the cosmic ballgame. Just as you have hierarchies upon Ea rth that you may or may not be aware of, there are hierarchies in the cosmos. You can live within a cer tain area and not be aware that any hierarchy exis ts. You can farm your land, pay your taxes, decide not to vote, and simply be oblivi ous to any bureaucratic political structure. In somewhat the same way, Earth is oblivious to the bur eaucratic political structure that operates in the universe. It is important for you to understand that bureaucracies or hierarchies exist, a nd that these organizations have different experiences of time than you do. Others do not live within the structure of time as you know it. What you call one year pe rhaps to others may be only one small portion of a day. If you can really begin to comprehend this, you can understand why this planet has seemingl y been left to itself fo r the last few thousand year s. Now-, activity is beginning to bubble and boil again from the skies, and you will be faced with inse rting a vast amount of new knowledge into your paradigms and your belie f systems. This plan et is in for a culture shock-a big surprise. You have come here at this time for a certain purpose: T hose creator gods who rearranged the human species are returning. Some of them are already here. This planet ha s been visited over and over again, and many different forms of human being have been seeded here through a variety of experiments. There have been many influential f actors that have created the course of histor y on Earth. There have b een civilizations on this planet that have existed for millions of years that have come and gone and not left a trace. These civilizations , each and every one of them, we re influenced by those you may term God. Your history has been influe nced by a number of light be ings whom you have termed God. In the Bible, many of these beings have been co mbined to represent one being, when they were not one being at all, but a combination of very power ful, extraterrestrial light- b eing energies. They were indeed awesome energies from our perspective, and it is easy to understand why they were glorified and worshiped. There is no literature on Earth that gives you a true pi cture of these beings. All of the gods came here to learn and to enhance their own development thr ough working with creativity, consciousness, and energy. Some became very successful and master ed their own lessons, while some made quite devastating errors. Who were these gods from ancient times? They were beings w ho were able to m ove reality and to command the spirits of nature to bend to their will. Humans have traditionally called beings God who could do thin g s that the human race could not do."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"These beings were passed down through the ancient cultures of may- societie s, portrayed as winged creatures and balls of light. The world is permeate d with hints, clues, a nd artifacts of who your gods have been. However, those wo wished to manipul ate humans made up their owm stories to create a p aradigm that would control you. You were told that these beings were tr uly gods, and you were taught to worship, obey, and adore them. Th is paradigm is now on the verge of making a gigantic shift. The truth is going to come forward, a truth that will completely change the way you view the world. Woe be to those wo are unwilling to lo ok. The shock reverberations ar e going to move around the world. The creator gods who have been ruling this planet have the ability to become physical, though mostly they exist in other dimensions. Th ey keep Earth in a certain vibr ational frequency wh ile they create emotional trauma to nouris h themselves. There are some beings who honor life before everything else, and there are also beings who do not honor life and do not understa nd their connection to it. Consciousness feeds consciousness. It is hard for you to understand this concept because you feed yourself with food. The food for some beings is c onsciousness. All food contai ns consciousness at some p oint in its own development, whethe r you fry it, boil it, or pick it from the garden; you i ngest it to keep yourself nourished. Your emotions are food for others. When you are controlled to bring about havoc and frenzy, you are creating a vibrat ional frequency that supports the existence of thes e others because that is how they are nourished. There are those who live off the vi bration of love, and that group woul d like to reestablish the food o f love on this planet. They would like to turn this uni verse into the frequency of love so that it can have the opportunity to go out and seed other worlds. You represent the renegade group of light, and you have agreed to co me back on the planet. You are on assignment. You come into thes e physical bodies and take them over, and you intend, through the powe r of your spiritual identity, to cha nge the physical body. You a ll selected with great care he genetic lines that would best give you head star ts with all of this. Each of you chose a genetic history through which members of the Family of Light have threaded. When human beings existed in th eir rightful domain and could understand many realities, they had the ability to be multidimensional, to be one and equal with the gods. You are beginning to awaken this identity within yourself. The gods raided this reality. Just like corporate ra iders in your time come in and take over a business b ecause perhaps the pension funds are in great abunda nce, so the funds upon this planet were in great abundance at the time these raider gods appeared. In order to have you believe they were Gods with a big G, they rearranged you genetically. That is when the Family of Light was scattered from the planet, and the dark team, which operated out of ignorance, came in. Y our bodies carry a fear a nd a memory of striving fo r the knowledge that those gods represented and took away fr om you. The gods who did this are magnificent space creatures. They can do many kinds of manipulations and work with realities in many different ways. Humans, in ignorance, began to call these space creatures God with a big G. God with a big G has never visited this pl anet as an entity. God with a big G is in all things. You have only dealt with gods with a little g who have wanted to be a dored and to confuse you, and who have thought of Earth as a principality, a place that they own out in the ga lactic fringes of this free-will universe."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Before the raid, you had tremendous abilities. The original biogenetic example of the human was given incredible information, was inte rdimensional, and could do many th ings. When those creator gods raided, they found that the local sp ecies knew too much. The local speci es had abilities that were too much like those who were pa ssing themselves off as God. A biogenetic manipulation wa s done, and there was much destructi on. There were experimental versions of the species brought onto the plan et, where the original database was scattered but not destroyed. At one time, your DNA was int act. It was like a beautifu l library where the info rmation was all catalogued and referenced and you could find anything you want ed to find instantl y. When- the biogenetic alteration occurred to unplug the data, it eras as if someone hid the re ference system and pulled all the b ooks off the shelves and heaped them into a pile on the door so that there was no order to them. This is how your DNA was scattered and scrambled by the raiders a long time ago. We are telling you a story now; there is definitely a story to th is. We speak not to your logical mind but to your memory banks, so that you can begin to remember pa rticipating in this story. In this way, you will begin to understand what has happene d and who you are within this process. All of the genetic information was scattered; it did not have an order, but it was left inside the cells. The only information that remained for you to play wi th and to keep you functioning was the double helix. Many of the databases along the double helix were shut down, closed, so that you began to function with very little data. You were very easy to manipulate and c ontrol by many aspects of consciousness passing themselves off as God with a big G. Certain entities took the existing spec ies, which was indeed a glorious species, and retooled it for thei r own uses, their own needs. They disrupted the in formational frequency inside human beings, changed the DNA, and gave you the double helix so that you could be ke pt in ignorance. Your frequency o f accessibility was simply shut off so that you couldn't turn the dial of your own radio. These creator gods set out to alter the DNA insi de the human body, which is the intelligence, the b lueprint, the code. If a code does not have a place to operate withi n, it cannot fire itself into existence or express itself into existence. If you are locked up in a little ti ny room and never given any place to grow, you can never express yourself . The last number of thousand year s, your code has been forced to fit inside a very limited DNA. One of the most exciting aspects about being on Earth right now is that there is a reordering or a retooling taking place in your DNA. Cosmic rays are coming onto the plan et so that a change is being b roadcasted and a reordering is taki ng place inside the body. The scattere d data that holds the history and awareness of the Living Library is now lining up. The DNA is evolving. New helixes or strands are being formed as the light-encoded filaments are b eginning to bundle themselves together. The scattere d data is being pulled together in your body by electromagnetic energies fr om Prime Creator. We ar e here to watch this pr ocess in you, to assist you, and to evolve ourselves as well. As this rebundling or reordering comes together, you will create a more evolved nervous system that will allow much more data to move itself into your consciousness. You wi ll awaken many brain cells that have been lying dormant, a nd you will come into use of your full physical body ra ther than the small percentage that you have been functioning with. Ever y p lace on the p lanet is bein g affected b y this chan g e, this awareness. Those of y ou who are the"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Guardians of Light and who wish to completely change this present r eality and bring di fferent options in are anchoring the frequency. If it is not anchored and understo od, it can create chaos. It will create chaos. This is why you must ground yourselves. Chaos brings about a state of reor ganization when utilized properly. Time is collapsi ng, and the energy is becoming larger and larger. You have come here to use that energy first. You will make pathways o f consciousness as you pull the energy into your body that will as sist others so that they may not have to go through what you go through. Many people will suddenly begin to f eel this energy without any prepar ation at all. You are all pulling light, which is data and information, onto the plan et, and as you do this you create new pathways fo r consciousness to explore without even saving a word. The new pathways of consciousness create new real ities, new options, and ne w ways of living and b eing. That is why the collapse of your society is inevitable: It does not hold light; it does not hold the multidimensional possibilities ; it holds you in limitation, and you are tired of that. The creator gods are space beings who have their own home in spa ce. They are also evolving. There are those who would like to kick them out of the \"creator god club\" because they feel that they do not value the life that they create. Before the takeover a bout 300,000 years ago, many of the original team worked here to bring information and create this vast inform ation center that was to be used to connect many galactic systems. Then there was a great war among the creator gods, and the space beings, whose stories are in the ancient manuscripts of this planet, won the fight. Th ey came here because they wanted this place for many of th eir own reasons. In Prime Creator's universe here, all things are allowed. Because all things are allowe d, many lessons arelearned. Some of these creator gods married and merged their lines, just as on the European continent different monarchs and royal families have married and merged their kingdom s. The creator gods would mix one kind with another to see what they could create . Remember, they understood genetics, and all things were created by manifesting and us ing the life force and understanding how the life force works. It is beyond your comprehension at this time how vast this project has been. Who are these beings who came in and rent asunder the original plans for Earth? Who are these space beings we sometimes refer to as the Dark T-Shirts ? Be kind when you speak of the forces of darkness. Do not speak as if they are bad. Simply understand that they are uninformed, and they create systems that are uninformed because that is how they believe they must operate. They fought at one time and separated themselves from knowledge, so now they desperat ely hold onto their existing knowledge an d onto life as they have evolved it in to being. It is life ba sed on fear, life that doe s not honor other life, life that uses other life. Who are these beings? They are the reptiles. These space beings are part human a nd part reptilian. We call them the Lizzies because we like to make things a little less emotional and a little humorous so th at you don't take them so seriously and get so upset. We are not here to frighten you-we are here to inform you. You know all of this inside you, an d as you begin to open the history of who you are, some' of you will be gin to access reptilian memories. You are under a delusion if you believe that you alwa ys incarnate as human beings. You incarnate to experience creation, to gather in formation about creation, and to comprehend it collectively. You certainly don't go into just one experience. It woul d be like eating dinner at the same restaurant you r whole life and then saying, \"I know all about food.\" It's foolis hness. Begin to expand your boundaries and realize that y ou have to ex p erience man y thin g s. There is brilliance within all life."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Creator gods take many forms, and they are not al l Lizzies. There are creator gods who are insectlike. We Pleiadians are associated with the creator gods that are birdlike and reptilian. There were those who came from space and worked with th e energy of the birds in many diff erent cultures. If you look at the drawings of ancient cultures in Egypt, South America, and North America, you will see signs of the b irds and reptiles. At one time, the birds and the reptiles wo rked together, and at other times they fought. As you comprehend more, the story will get larger . You will begin to remember your history. The creator gods are very connected to you. When you decide to beco me a parent, you agree to learn from your children, to be responsi ble for their welfare, and to teac h them to become responsible fo r themselves. It is the same with the creator gods. Through watching you grow, they are learning about life; they are learning about what they create; they are learning how to be good parents, so to speak. Some creator gods created life just to have it take care of them or meet thei r needs. They have fed of f your emotions. One of the big secrets that has been ke pt from you as a species is the richness and wealth that accompanies emotion. You ha ve been steered away from e xploring emotion because through emotion you can figure things out. Your emotions connect you with the spiritual body. The spiritual body, of course, is nonphysical, existing on the multidimensional sphere. The range of frequency modulation has now been shif ted, and energies from th e outside are working to alter the planet. These energies deed you. They cannot alter the planet fr om the outside-the planet must b e altered from the inside. The ener gies simply bring in creative co smic rays that penetrate your body and create the evolutionary l eap inside your body. Once you understa nd the proper use of emotion and b egin to get control over your own frequency, you will be able to broadcast these rays. Then, you will not feed the frequency of fear to this plane of existence. As the frequency of fear begins to diminish upon this planet, many activities will be promulgated to b ring about an increase in fear because those who live off the fearful fre quency will be losing thei r nourishment, their food. They will make an attempt to reinstate that frequency before they change thei r nourishment to the new frequency of love. The Lizzies have set Earth up with de vices that can broadcast and magnify the emotional turmoil on this planet. That turmoi l is sent to them, a nd it sustains them in some way. In order to come to a planet, you must have a portal or way to get into it. You coul d fly into space, say to Jupiter, but if you never find the portal that allows you to enter the planet's time frame of existence, you could land on a place that looks deso late and without life. Portals al low you to enter the dimension o f the planet where life exists. Portals open onto the corridors of time and serve as zones o f multidimensional experience. There have been different portals on Earth that have allowed different species, creator gods from space, to insert themselves. One of the huge portals that presently is being fought over is the portal of the Middle East. If you think back over the history of Earth, you will recognize how many dramas o f religion and civilization have been introduced in that portal. It's a huge portal-with a radius of a thousand miles or so. This is why there is so much act ivity in the Middle East. Th is is the portal that the Lizzies use. To some extent, the Lizzies have controlled this portal . They have used this area to create thei r underground bases and caverns, from which they ope rate. The ancient civili zation of Mesopotamia, b etween the Tigris and Euphrates ri vers, was a space colony where a ce rtain civilization was introduced. Kuwait sits at the mout h of this territory. This is a portal that involves manipulation of the human p o p ulation to serve the needs of others."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Within the Lizzie population, there are those who are benevolent and those who are malevolent. Why are we telling you all this? Why do you need to know it? You need to know it because th e Lizzie reality is reentering and merging with your dimension. Part of your evoluti onary leap in consciousness is not simply to go into love and light and eat ice cream sundaes every day. You must comprehend how complex reality is, how many different forms of reality there are, and how they are all you. You must make peace with them and merge with them to create an implosion of the coll ection of your soul. In this way, you can come back to Prime Creator. You are going to be faced with ma ny opportunities to judge many thin gs and label them as bad. But, when you judge and label, you will not experience and f eel the new realiti es. Always remember that this is a free-will zone and that there is a Divine Plan, which is going to be the last plan, the last card to be p layed. You all must remember that this last card is going to be an ace. The nature of the drama on this planet is quite in teresting. Whenever there is a frequency modulation o f an existing system, there is a certa in magnetism that moves out from that system. This magnetism draws every energy that was ever involved wi th that system back to the system so that it can be part of the evolution or process. You are magnetizing everything to yourself that you have ever experienced so that you can feel everything you need to feel about it. The creator gods of ancient times ar e being drawn back here at this time because of the Divine Plan. They must participate in it and understand that their frequencies are goi ng to be changed. They are resisting this, just like many human s are resisting. Yet, they create their own realitie s. These creato r gods of the last 300,000 years have forgotten who created them! They have forgotten their gods. As members of the Family of Light, you have not fo rgotten. Your task is comprehension: to pull comprehension and understanding onto the planet, which will stabilize the energy and generate the p ower to create. Light is underestimated on this planet, and these creator gods underestimate you. Even in their own brilliance, they have blind spots. They are so enamored of power that they fight amongst themselves. The creator gods gave up a porti on of themselves and became ensconced, enamor ed with their own p roject. You are linked to these bei ngs because you are extensions or operable forces of them. You are here to affect reality not simply from the outside but from the inside. It is this that you are intending to remember. The creator gods are coming back to raid you again because they don't want to starve. They understand that there is \"systems busting\" going on through you, so they are here to create greater havoc and fear, to fight once again for this territory. Th eir food source is important to them . They are losing control of the p lanet, so they are going back to their prime porta l in the Middle East, wher e their nest is located underneath the ground, to create fear and chaos. The Original Planners wish to bri ng freedom of choice with respect to frequency back to this planet. The gods who have been in charge here for this last period of evolution use frequency modulation and do not allow freedom of choice. They rob your psychic ener gy by giving you a false pictur e of reality in every way that you could possibly imagine. We are not sa ying these gods are bad. We are simply informing you of events that take place and of how innocen tly you become involved in these events.

Once upon a time, there were beings who wanted to crea te something. In order to do this, they needed to go in and very subtly change a pa rt of creation. These beings worked for, were associated with, and carefully guarded an aspect of consciousness called light. At diffe rent times, these Guardians of Light met and worked together and crosse d paths in the different realms of reality. They planned, they shared blueprints, and they designed a time wh en their plan would go into effect. Certain members of this light team plotted the probabilities of Prim e Creator: what Prime Creator would do, where Prime Creator would act , and how Prime Creator would be stimulated. These entities understood what could be done with light, and their plan was very ca refully orchestrat ed. For several hundred thousand years, these beings of light were trained to carry out this plan. Part of the plan involved being ready for a cosmic jolt that they anticipated would eventual ly be coming from Prime Creator."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"There was a great deal of dedica tion and preparation as the groundwor k was laid and the training begun. There was much to be learned before this plan coul d be implemented, for it was a daring plan. It was the intention of these Guardians of Li ght to take light, or knowledge, into a reality where that light was not welcomed and did not fit. It was like putting your foot in a shoe that does not fit. These beings had a plan to prepare for the time when that light wou ld fit. These be ings are you , and tha t time is now . The time has been carefully orchestrated, and each of you knows in the deepest portions o f your being that you have come here for a purpose. You have come to begin the pivotal movement to release everything that has bound you up until now- into your reality, that has held you with fine threads like steel cords and locked you into ideas about yourselves and your relationship to the cosmos. For those of you who have come to act out your plan and to work with the consciousness of light, you r time is n ow. Your action springs from this moment. All you need to do is be gin to allow this energy to come into your body. You must begin to vibrate with this energy and to clear the passages of the self, the emotional energies that hold th emselves locked in your physical body. As you begin to examine the self, you will find that th ere are many selves in which to travel on the inner highway s or inner nervous system of consciousness. You will find that your society ha s been very cleverly designed to keep you from knowing this most intimate and rewarding and exciting portion of your self. As Guardians of Li ght, you are going to create options of reality and bri ng them to the mass consci ousness of the planet. You will do this by first doing it for yourself, creating an inne r peace and inner love by accepti ng who you are and all that you have done in life and all that has been done to you in life. You wi ll accept and integrate these things because you will know they have been exac tly the situations necessary to bring you into this final stage o f anchoring light. This story is an ancient one, and it is stored within your body. Part of what we are requesting of you and reminding you is to open this histor ical treasure house and become an inner archaeologist. Be willing to travel the roads of memory of th is lifetime and many other lifetime s so that you can begin to have a p icture of the purpose of consciousness. When you begin to picture the purpose of your ow n consciousness, and you discover the clever ways you have traveled, th e many guises you have used, and the many actions you have participated in, you will learn to accept the totality of your being. When you are able to accept behavior that was not uplifting behavior, and accept your own identity of sexuality, and accept how you valued or did not value life in many lifetimes, it will open. a chakra center in your body that is located around the thymus gland, between the fourth and fifth chakras.

We want you to begin to unders tand the magnitude of what is occurring to your species on this planet so that you can operate wi th comfort, knowledge, and knowing. The Original Planners are quite capable of plo tting different courses a nd different realities. As we have mentioned, in a free-wi ll universe, all is allowed by Prim e Creator. Therefore, since time does not exist as you know it outside of your local sector, things are le ft to work themselves out. So, to you humans, it seems as if it has been a long time since any kind of cosmic planetary excitement has taken place on Earth. In the larger scheme of evolution, it has not been so long, but because you are locked in the time frame of Earth, it feels as if it has been a long time. Light gives information, and darkness withholds information. So, in the ti mes that are coining, it will be easy for you to discern who's who and what's what as you travel outside the thir d-dimensional realm. All you need to do is discern whether so mething is light and you are being gi ven information or whether it is darkness and you are being disinformed, misinformed, or information is being co mpletely withheld from you. Darkness and light have come from the same creator, Prime Creator, who has created a host of creato r gods to go out and do its bidding. It has given all these creator gods fr eedom to form worlds: to discove r how to create life, how to become responsible stew ards of life, and how to become parents for the p lanets in the galactic systems th at they have created. Learning to become a good parent has been a constant ongoing process. The creator gods have taken themselv es and made themselves and fed their worlds from themselves. In Egypt, there is a story about a creator god who masturbated and cr eated the world. The god took himsel f and made small identities out of himself so that he could be in what he made and not outside of it. You are all needed to access the por tion of memory that is part of the creator gods. Who are these gods? Who are the gods that fought with these gods? Who are some of the gods who came here and controlled you? Part of your task is to access your memory. When these beings return to Eart h, there will be many of you who will turn to th em and say, \"Yes, these are wonderful gods. I feel wonderf ul about them. They are so ma gnificent. Look what they can do.\" Some of these gods will seem to fi x and save your world. This is wher e it will be easy to miss the bigge r p icture. It will look as if they are coming to fix and save your world when, in actuality, what they are doing is simply creating anot her form of authority and control. Wh at we are saying is that people will p ut a belief system and a paradigm on these entities. There will be a large mark eting program to sell the p resence of these entities to you. This program is already going on. You are not like the masses on Earth, for you are members of the Family of Light, and you know things that others do not. You may know that these beings are not of li ght, and you may know it to the core o f your being. You may become sickened in a society that does not know this. Many people will turn to worshiping these beings because it w ill seem as if miracles are occurr ing and the grandest event in the history of the world is taking place. It may seem that humanity is being gi ven a whole new opportunity, a whole new golden era. Then there will be a very big surprise, and people will find that the tyrannies are larger than ever before. The purpose, of course, is for each individual to become sovereign and for the planet to unite. Not everyone is going to make the shift. Everyone is not in the vibration that wants to work in harmony at this time.

You are all learning about authority. Who is the boss for the beings who are here now? Who is thei r God? Who is their authority? That authority is coming back to Earth. Th ere is a lesson in this for Earth. These beings, who are neither spiritually informed nor lean in spiritual ways, deny the existence of a spiritual force. They have devel oped scientific principl es and technologies that scatter the laws o f spirituality. You may think that because you unders tand or believe in the spiritual realms that every person, as they evolve, will naturally embrace that information. It is not so. It is possible to become a brilliant master o f manipulating matter and r eality without understanding spiritual conne ctions. It is very important that you learn this. There will be those who will come from the stars to this planet who will have abilities that will be incredible to the mass consciousness of the people up on Earth. But these beings will not feel, for they will not be connected to any spir itual seeking. The choice to seek, to awaken the spiritual self, is, o f course, free to each person upon this planet and to each person in this whole universe. Not everyone is going to realize it. Just as you have cultivate d very powerful individuals upon this planet who are not in touch with thei r feeling centers-who have no connect ion to emotional and spiritual consciousnessthere are those who exist in space who are extremely powerful space kings or space ent ities who have nothing to do with spirituality. They are powerful fo rces. If you met these forces, you would feel like David meeting Goliath. That is why it is important for all of you to learn how to alte r your reality so that you can dance between the vibrations of frequency, or flip into th e station of the world that you want to experience. Wanting to have something to worship is the freque ncy control on Earth. What the planet is headed fo r is someone or something new to worship. That is the potential holographic insert-a new god to worship. The creator gods, the reptiles, know that their plan has run short, so to speak, and there is an intention o f creating a new plan, a new diversion, a new di sempowerment. Therefore, beyond anything else, listen to y ourselves. Listen to the internal message that comes through to you a nd begin to dance with it an d make friends with it. Y ou, yourselves, are meant to discover reality from inside and to direct your life in this way. This is really the gift th at is given in the free-will zone. Part of the dichotomy or balancing in a free-will zone is the allowance of all things, even tyrannies. In this free-will zone, everyone is endow ed with the potential to create th eir own reality. It is a free-will choice to create having so meone else create reality for you. Most people on Eart h allow others to create and dictate their reality to them. Through frequency control, you have been steered to look outside o f y ourself for answers. When new gods appear, you are ready to worship them. It goes on and on. Those who control frequency in this way are lost in the same thing, and you are their mirror. As you begin to live accordi ng to your own guidance and your own daring, everything changes completely. This is occurring in many places. Just as thought trav els on Earth, there are highways on which thought can be directed thr oughout the cosmos. The gridworks a nd creative cosmic rays are part of an intergalactic system that di rects what you believe into other plac es of existence.

The Original Planners are after much more than this particular zone here: they are after a shift in the universal DNA. They want the entire universe to orchestrate a new symphony in consciousness. They are not only after the rees tablishment of frequency availability on Earth. Their game is much bigger: they are after a restructuring of the vibratory rate of this entire universe. Th ey are creating this by going into key zones to infiltrate and bring about a simultaneous implosion. There will be a universal awakening within these various centers so that the entire universe will change its frequency in its own time. The Original Planners have solicited the interest of Prime Creator. Prime Creator learns from all things that exist because it is all thi ngs. Just as you are learning to honor your lessons, the things that you manifest for yourself, Prim e Creator honors all creations . Prime Creator lets its creations be and learns about its own potential by wa tching what it has birthed, just as a wise parent le arns from its children. Prime Creator needs you to go out and bring the newest inventions unto it so that it can experience and evolve. Prime Creator has turned its energy to ward this free-will zone because, from a vast point in your future, it has been shown where this expe riment will go if left unchecked and unattended. Energy could simply run rampant and own other energy. There is a vast probability that reach es out for hundreds and thousands of years of a dictatorsh ip in this universal system. From a place far into the future, this experiment is being reworked: its essential energy is being transmuted and tr ansformed. You are a part of that transformation by going into the bowels of the system in various disguises and becoming awakened. The human portion of you has delin eated who is a good guy and who is a bad guy and who is who in the space hierarchy.

What is occurring upon the planet now is the literal mutation of your phys ical body, for you are allo wing it to be evolved to a point where it will be a computer that can house this information. This is going to occur due to biogenetic engineer ing that really has nothi ng to do with you. You can facilitate the process, of cour se, by intending cooperation with it. As a species, you are being b iogenetically altered by the beings who created you and who redesign your DNA at periodic junctures in your history. This time period was designed by the original creator gods or project designers for them to come bac k and take over this place and return it to its original plan. Millions have been ca lled to participate in this p roject. Millions have sai d, \"Yes, we are renegades. Let us go and take back this project and see if we can set it right. We will rebuild the ruins and put it together.\" So the plans have been drawn and the designs made and the genetics studied to find who carries the recessive genes and the chord of li ght inside them. You have selected with great clarity the parentage that genealogically pr ovides you with the fullest accessibility to combinations of li ght-encoded filaments that can potentially evolve. Before you came into the body, all of you committed to designing events that would fire your codings, or blueprints that would activat e your memories. Then you came in to the body and you forgot. All o f you have had your blueprints and co dings fired to some extent beca use you understand that there is a divine purpose or Divine Plan that you are a part of . The firing of the codings and the realization of you r identity are going to become phenomenally intense. The reason for this is the evolving DNA. When you have twelve helixes of DNA in p lace, those helixes will be g in to p lu g into the twelve-chakra s y stem."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"The twelve chakras are vort ex centers loaded with information that you must be able to translate. You are evolving yourself even when you are not on the planet and you are perhaps more involved with othe r identities of yourself. Therefore, to evolve, you pick part icularly challenging si tuations in which you have to rise beyond what has been established as a ceiling or boundary of what is possi ble. You have to b ecome super beings in wh atever reality you enter be cause, as members of the Family of Light, the b ranch of renegades, this is your forte. You purposely came to this planet to give yourself such a challenge so that you could be defiant-not in a wa y that would give you probl ems or create disharmony, but in a way that would create harmonic defiance. Through your harmony, you are defiant toward the old vibrational frequency. Part of the friction you feel with others is that you are on this path of evolution and bursting forth. Others don't like this because they are not coded at this time to respond th e way you are. Some people are not coded at all for this. Some knew the plan of change and came he re at this time to be observers. Some timid beings came here knowi ng that if they had the courage to step onto this planet-while realizing what the blueprint of the planet was-that somehow this would be an accreditation of their own conscious journey and would catapul t them into higher consciousness ev en if their only participation in the transition was simply to be here. j ust to be in the vicinity of this kind of activity is empow ering. So give due credit to all who are on the p lanet at this time who have decide d to be participants in this gr eat frequency change. All of these p articipants are necessary, because the more frequencie s that are on the planet, the more energy that can b uild to alter the old frequency. Those who have ope ned themselves to light are literally having thei r b odies rearranged. Sometimes you may wake up at night and literall y feel the rearrangement. This rearrangement of the body is th e restructuring of the DNA. Your DNA is a filament; a scientis t would describe it as a connectiv e filament. Scientists, doing the best they can up to this point, have found certain codings within certain portions of the DNA. They have also found superfluous portions of the DNA . In other words, there are porti ons that they cannot translate o r figure out, so they think these portions of the DNA ar e just there for the ride, and they call them \"jun k DNA.\" They are off track. We have talked about how all of you were built by the creator gods. You we re built like houses that were going to be expanded or added on to in the futu re. You are now at that juncture when those who designed you are adding on to who you are. What the scientists call \"junk DNA\" has been dormant in your body for a long time, and it is now becoming activated. In our teachings, we alwa ys emphasize the importance of oxygenation, because oxygen feeds th e coding and awakens the junk DNA in your body (which certainly isn't junk at all). What scientists are calling \"junk\" houses the perceptions deep inside of your body that will allow you to become an entire percei ver, a fourth-dimen sional being. This awakening DNA will allow you to change your eyesight, change your hearing, increase your life span, and so on. This dormant part of the DNA that has baffled the scientists is now coming to life. You are mutating so quickly now th at certain scientists call the process a disease. Some are very concerned about it. They ha ve persuaded the government to invest billions of dollar s to research DNA. What is occurring in your body is certainly not a disease: you ar e being naturally mutated and rearranged. This mutation occurs most often while you are sleeping, so you may be waking up in the mornings noticing that something feels a little different in your body. You can expect that the changes will begin to show themselves and that you will develop new abilities. You will automatically know, man y thin g s."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The original designers of the hum an body were benevolent beings. These original creator gods were very generous in endowing you biogene tically with a tremendous vitality of spirit and a tremendous zest of capability. Much of this inform ation is stored within your body in the light-encoded filaments that are scattered and are coming back into alignment. Your bones a nd skeletal form correspond with that information. When your skeletal form is in alignment, th e energy from sacred po wer sites is released, the cosmic rays are pulled into your body, and the light-encoded filame nts inside your cells begin to reorder themselves, you will find that you are in the change. The ch ange will be mirrored to you everywhere you look. The present evolutionary system designed by the creator gods to step you up a number of dimensions o r frequencies is based upon the evolution of the twel ve helixes that correspond to the twelve chakra centers-seven within your body and five outside your body. This is simp ly the way the system plugs in. With respect to the evolution of the helixes within the human body, a common denominator frequency must be attained that even those in the lowest possible stations can reach. There are also those humans who c ould go beyond the twelve helixes. In general, however, the state o f consciousness of humanity cannot achi eve that kind of acceleration. It is enough of a leap for people to go from a double-helix system to a twelve-helix system. Some people will be functioning wi th the twelve helixes within a short period of time, while others around the planet will not receive this shift until later in the decade. This is simply because each individual is coded to be given th e frequency when they are capable of integrating it. Many are already having a difficult time inte grating the changes at this early stage of the plan. A large majority of the humans on Earth have convinced them selves that there is only one reality and there can be no other. This could be the downfall of the human race. As the helixes come into full force in a person, there is an aw akening of the person's inner knowledge, knowledge that goes beyond what th e person has been taught. This inner knowledge is knowledge o f self, knowledge that says there is much more than this physical world. B elieve it. Know, it. Understan d it. The physical world is a clue to the spiritual world. The world of spirit and self-evolution is on the verge of an information explosion: cheap energy, free energy- everything will be given to you. All of this is related to the evolving light-encoded filaments, whic h are millions and billions of tiny little fibers. As we related the story to you, the raiding creator gods who came in and took over needed to have you operate in a certain way in order to control you. Th ey needed to unplug your intelligence, and so they did, by scattering and di sconnecting the light-encoded filaments that form the helixes in your DNA. These filaments are now beginning to reconnect into he lixes. The helixes will evolve in sets of three until there are twelve strands, or helixes. When these tw elve helixes or strands of many light-encoded filaments begin to vibrate within the body, each of the strands will correspond to a chakra center. There are multitudes of chakra centers, and there ar e multitudes of potential he lixes that can form. Right now, the common denominator with respect to the num ber of helixes and chakra s that the consciousness of humanity can handle without dest roying itself is twel ve. So we are deali ng right now with an evolvement of twelve helixes to plug into the twelve chakras as mentioned befo re, seven chakras in the b ody and five chakras outside the body. The seven chakras in the body are not too difficult to work with b ecause, if you allow yourself to feel, you can physically touch and lo cate all of them. The first three are the chakras of survival, sexuality, and perceptual feeling. The fourth chakra is the heart-center o f com p assion and connectedness to all thin g s. The fifth is the throat chakra, which relates to s p eakin g ."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"The sixth is the third eye, the vi sion.

When you get to the five outside of the body, you must b egin to find new ways to figure out what is going on with somethi ng that you don't even know for sure is real. The eighth chakra is within your realm of activity. It hovers twelve inches or more above your head. Most people keep the eighth chakra center close to th eir physical body. The ninth ch akra is close as well, within a few feet of the body. Once nine helixes ar e formed, this chakra will move out into the atmosphere of Earth to become more of an Earth chakra, connecting into the gridwork. It is a link. The tenth, eleventh, and twelfth chakras are much fu rther out. The tenth chakra , once it is in line and p lugged in, will be in your solar sy stem. The eleventh chakra will m ove out into your galactic system, and the twelfth will be located and anc hored some place in this universe. You will receive informatio n from these personal centers, for they are collective center s as well, just as your other personal chakra centers are collective centers. As you learn to translate the chakra experiences, you will discover that life is not the same anymore. N ot all people on the pl anet are going through these changes right now, because you are not all coded to respond at this particular time. Each of you came in with a certa in order-a map of when and where an d how you best operate. Many of you are learning how to foll ow this plan of the self that will lead you to discover your exalted self. Once you l earn how to do this, life will become quite effortless because you will become a vehicle for light and you will be moved just by your intention to commit. Different humans will be exposed to these changes at different time s because it would not do to have them occur all at once. Th is would create chaos, wher e a certain order is need ed. As an individual goes through the changes and translates th e experience, they can turn to someone to assist them who has already gone through the changes. For those of you who are the beginning people, the process can be very difficult. You are the way showers. Once you are able to go through the changes, you can make the p ath and show others. There are road maps that indicate certain events that can occur if you wish to plug into those gridworks of time. The greater comm itment you have in every moment to your own evolution, the sooner the changes will occur for the last person. There was a time when the human species occupied higher dimensi onal frequencies and you had the ability to move through r ealities and manipulate matt er. Many of these abilitie s were purposely scattered b y those beings who are in char ge of your reality. You must unde rstand that every reality has its guardians and that there are different stewardships and gua rdians at different times. We are using the term guardian in a neutral fashion. You use the term guardian for someone who is p rotective. We will say that a guardia n is in charge of reality and that perhaps they guard it from others; they don't let others come in and change their real ity. Guardians, as we are referring to them, are not necessarily benevolent, uplifting en tities. The entities who are guard ing your reality could be keeping out those entities who would set you free. You have forgotten so much because you were re tooled, and many of your inherent abilities were scattered and unplugged so that they would not wo rk. Control came down over minds in your society. There are veils of protection that were put around Earth, because if you were to attempt to plug into some of this information, you woul d not have the tools or the backgr ound or the ability to make sense o f these realities."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"N ow the whole planet is immersed in expanding realities.

You are going to ha ve to travel the emotional highway, b ecause the human body expresses its elf through the emotions. That is the uniqueness and gift of you r species. First you will need to open the em otional highways to areas that you have hidden from yourself in this p articular lifetime. Memories may flo od in as this data is lined up inside you memo ries about events that were difficult for you at the time or perhaps that you did not have a context for. Some of you may uncover the events of extraterrestri al contact that all of you had wh en you were children. Some of you may uncover expressions of sexuali ty that you did not understand at th e time you were involved in them, whether you were a passive or an active participant. Such thi ngs have been buried by the human emotional body because it is ve ry sensitive to judgment, and the mental body passes tremendous j udgment. The emotional body, linked to the spiritual body, hides from this. You all think you know who you are. You have stories of who you are based upon what you remembe r of growing up in this li fetime. What we want to communicate to you is that you have a number o f p arallel, legitimate existences th at have different memories than you have. You stopped these memories or didn't focus on the related events because your emotional body could not compute them. Much of what you will tap into is tied to your sexuality because it is a part of yourself that you have not understood and that you must go in to in order to understa nd its purpose. What is sexuality all about? Who made these rules about the a ppropriate and inappropriate expre ssion of it? Also coming up for you will be the realization of the contacts and en ergy that were continuously around many of you when you were younger to teach you; you bloc ked out these events because you were not given the support to believe they tr uly occurred. As you begin this multidimensional exploration, the memories that you have hidden fr om yourself will come forward. You will be astounded that you could have co mpletely forgotten wh ole events and large chunks of your life, espe cially events that occurred when you were under twelve y ears old. You will be amazed when you explore the ability of the nervous sy stem to shut down the flow of data that the mind cannot compute. And yet, the record s are there, so you will replay th em. You now will have the ability to compute many of these things because you will learn to be neutra l and not to judge what you have p articipated in. As you explore your curren t body, identity, and lifetim e, do it quickly. You do not have years to study them. As the information in your DNA is retooled and replugged in, you will be able to feel how the events from this life connect and blossom and have a thread of purpose with many different places that you have lived and many different id entities that you have occupied. Ideally, you will move out of judgment, and because of that you will be able to pick up the story of what really happened here, which you will experience firsthand through cellular memory. The only way you can step into this higher frequency and determine the future of your lives on this planet is to not judge y our participation within this process. This is very complex and very important: feel what we just said. This process involves smashing the existing paradigm and becoming a heretic of reality.

DNA carries the coding, for this gene tic material and its helixes are made up of light-encoded filaments- tiny gossamer threads that carry information the way fiber optics systems do. The pillar of light that you use to activate yourself and to br ing information into your body is also composed of light-encoded filaments.

The light-encoded filaments inside your body are similar to a grand library-a library that is so gigantic it carries the history of your universe. During the c ourse of the Earth's hist ory, there have been many different species who have lived here. You have convinced yourself that humanity is native to this p lanet. Human beings were put here. People are in for a shock because they are going to discover very shortly the skeletal forms of very different creatures. Some of th ese have already been discovered, p articularly in South America, though they have been either written up in your tabloid newspapers and p assed off as a hoax or fear fully kept in secret. When the consci ousness of humanity is raised to the frequency of receptivity, a nd the nervous system of the mass psyche is balanced to the point that you can have a paradigm shift, Earth itsel f will reveal its secrets through a variety of means such as weathe r p atterns, Earth changes, psychic discoveries, a nd so on. You will unearth a whole new history. The task you have before you is to consciously co mmand, intend, and will the evolvement of your DNA. Commanding and willing a nd asking for this is not easv, for you must move through many identities. From the historical perspective of your multidimensi onal existence or essence or soul, you have been all kinds of characters, and some of th ese experiences have been painful. They have been challenging and difficult. It is time for you to m ove through the challenges and unlock the history that is inside of your body by allowing the lightencoded filament s to rebundle, forming new helixe s, and by allowing yourself to be receptive to what this ne w information in the DNA is going to pl ug in to you. It will not always make sense to your logical mind. You will learn that your logical mind has a place , a function, and a purpose, b ut that it is not your identity. The logical mind is overused by many people. It is overtaxed and abused, and when you overuse and abuse the logical mi nd, you create stress upon yo ur body. You do not always need to understand logically what you are experiencing. Watch yourself , maintain humor at all times, and maintain the idea that you are evolving. You will be going through many thi ngs because you are climbing a ladde r of identity made up of you r chakra system. The chakras are en ergy information centers that are keyed into lifetimes in which you activated or expressed yourself in one area or another. It is imper ative for you to discover your identity in these next few years. The light-encoded filaments ar e a tool of light, a part of light, and an expression of light. These light- encoded filaments exist as millions of fine, threadlike fibers inside your cells , while counterpart light- encoded filaments exist outside of your body. The light-encoded filame nts carry the La nguage of Light geometry, which carries the storie s of who you are. These lightencode d filaments were not previously able to come onto the planet because there was a pollution created by the dark team that kept them out. The light-encoded filaments are like ra ys of light that hold a geometric form of language. They come to you from a cosmic database and hol d information. Many of you are at the point where you don't need to have a healing done on your body. You need to have a spontaneous education, or implant, put into you r body to teach you. This is what will be coming during the next number of years. Some of the people on this planet, particularly those wo rking with crystals, will learn to fill and activate other bodies with these filaments. I ndividuals seeking this experience will have the filaments activated in their bodies to give them instant information a nd instant knowing. This is wh at education is evolving into. There will be beings who wi ll assist you with all of this. Y ou are going to have to be able to reco g nize these bein g s and to reco g nize other realities as the y exist around y ou."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"When the information in the light-encoded filaments was scattered, there was no burning of the libraries- it was simply that all of the books were torn off the shelves and left in the center of th e room. Imagine i f you walked into a room the size of a gigantic stadium and all of the books or information it had been filled with was pulled off the sh elves and left in the middle of the floor. How could you find anything except by chance? Since humans don't be lieve in the order of chance, th ey have never followed the orde r that is within them. The information in the filaments was left inside of you, yet there was no logical way to make sense of it. So, in the present time, how do you find the informa tion? The information is going to reveal itself to you. That is the process. You don't have to go looking for it because this revela tion is your heritage and who you are. As the DNA begins to form new strands, these new strands will travel along a nervous system in the body that is being developed at th is time, and memories will come flooding into you r consciousness. You must work to develop this nervous system, to pull light into your body, to oxygenate your system, to learn how to move through energy acc elerations, and to call mo re ideas and experiences into your body. As this process begins to grow and nurture itself in your body, simply observe it, for you will want to know how to access it. Getting stuck in your dramas is like reading one of your books ove r and over again and not letting all of the information in other books come together. There is more: there is n whole story. This whole story has to do with your entire soul. As members of the Family of Light, you are agreeing to hold in your physical bodies a conscious awarene ss of all of your existe nces. You are agreeing to accept what you have done and the pa rts you have played in all thes e existences and then to raid different realities and change them according to the dictates of your agr eement as a representative of the Family of Light. You have free will within this agreement, of course. The triple helix brings you into the feeling center. The feeling center is emo tion, and emotion is you r road or bridge or ticket to the spiritual self. When people deny the emotional se lf, they can't get into the spiritual realms. The Christed one said, \"Know thyself.\" Know thyselves. It's the same thing. That message was given on the planet a long time ago, but it was dist orted so that people could not understand how grand indeed they were and that all they had to do was rearrange themselves. The work is always internal. When you want to know how to go about bringing a change upon the p lanet, we always tell you to work with yourself. Develop yourself. Move be yond the boundaries of self. Learn to become multidimensional, to exist in th e astral world, and to travel beyond the physical body. Stop defining the body as ending \"her e,\" which is what society encour ages you to do so that you can be controlled. In a free-will zone, control is part of the game beca use someone wants to be in charge. You are members of the Family of Light. To wh at hierarchy and to what gods do you answer? DNA is a living history of truth and life. When one is able to merge with this history, one is able to go into realities without videos, ta pes, or books. One is able to experience. Many native cultures were trained to find the remnants of th e Living Library left upon this planet . That explains their reverence fo r Earth and animals and their understanding of the c ooperation that runs thr ough everything. These native cultures were purposely put upon the planet so that there would be a training ground and a place o f p otential memory activation when the time was right. DNA holds the code. It holds the blueprint of identit y, the plan for existence, the history of the universe, and the history of life in this particular lo cale. And, it is stored within the cells of huma ns. The original DNA of the stewards of th is planet, the human occupants, had a ge netic blueprint system that was based on the number twelve.

Earth is now entering a conjuncti on or lineup with purpose through wh ich the Original Planners are returning to reactivate the twelve-helix system in the occupying species-the hum an to date-and put Earth b ack on its track. When the biological library was con ceived of eons and eons ago, it was decided that the stewards of the planet would hold the key to unlocking the data that was stored in this Living Library. How does this tie in with the twelve information centers? When human chakra systems are connected, open, and activated, information st arts to seek its own expression and become available. There are certain things that will c ode or trigger this informat ion, bringing it to the forefr ont of existence to get it to begin to express itself. When you are hooked into the informati on centers, seven in your body and five outside your body, you ar e ready to receive energy through a nother set of twelve information centers. When you activate your own twelve chakras, you hook into ener gy stored in parallel sets o f twelve centers that will further activate your process. This wi ll eventually bring the brain into its complete, full, computerlike function. The twelve parallel realities hold ways to unlock information that ha s been secreted away. There are many steps to unlocking this inform ation. You could compare this to governmental deep security, which uses different levels of fingerprints and imprints to access the final bit of information. There are many different ways things must be connected if something ve ry secret is stored away. The activation of the twelve stra nds of DNA coincides with the activation, spinning, movement, and opening of the twelve centers of information-the twelve chakras or etheric energy discs. This is the b eginning of the connection of the sp inning of the twelve. When this alignment of energy takes place, it b rings and pulls energy into the twelve heavenly bodi es in your solar system. These bodies then begin to feed energy back to Earth. They activate themselv es by releasing what they hold so that Earth can biogenetically come alive. There ar e more and more of these groups of twelve-the twelve universes spinning, for example. Through the spinning of the twelve centers, there will be a chaos of new consciousness, because when these twelve energy centers-particula rly the outer five- b egin to hoo k themselves back up with the planet, there w ill be an incredible flood of new energy. The formation of the twel ve helixes will not mean that you will become completely informed as a species. It means that in order to catapult the sp ecies of humans forward in to a higher consciousness, there is a maximum and minimum mutation that needs to take pl ace to create a new standard o f operation. This mutation will bring in a new frequency level that each person will become affected by in their own way. The process could be compared to a new sun bein g born in your atmosphere. These twelve helixes certainly do not co mprise all of the information in side the light-encoded filaments. However, the forming of the twelve helixes will be plenty to give you, as a species, a much bigge r p icture of who you are. As members of the Family of Light, you know who you are. It is the humans who don't know who they are. Since you are in disguise as humans, however, so metimes you trick yourselves into thinking that you don't know who you are either. You know from the et ernal portion of your being that you are a member of the Family o f Light. We call Earth the Living Libr ary because you all have an image of what a library is: it is a place where information is stor ed and available. We use this analo gy because we intend to evoke the ima g e that"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"everywhere you go you are in a library. You just haven't figured out yet how to translate the information or recognize where it is in the library. This is the image that we would like everyone to begin to have. It will create a greater loving for Earth, and a greater realization that there is something for everyone to relate to in this place. No one need eve r b e alone when they find out that th ere is intelligent life willing to communicate with human beings. Once there is formulation of the twelve helixes, which hook one up to the twelve information centers, the library will be activated. Humans were designed to be the key to access this information in the Livi ng Library. There are many stories that we can go into about th is. Millions of years ago, all life co existed on this planet, particularly during the dinosaur period, when these large beasts operated as guardians of the planet and certain energies were building to store data here. For many millions of years this occurred. Right now twelve is the system that connects, and if you look around, you will see it everywhere. It was a symbolic insertion for a reas on: so that you would someday fi gure out that it connects you to something somewhere else. It is not your natural rh ythm but is a group agreem ent to use the energy o f twelve in many different systems of reality. It is a coded formula. Many things that make no sense to the logical mind make a tremendous amount of sense to the light-encoded fila ments and to the body as it is becoming more sensitive. There are those who would say that th is is a very inefficient system a nd that it is not a natural flow. But this system of twelve is the flow that this planet was adjusted t o. In actuality, if you, look, you are a system of thirteen. How many time s a year does the moon come full? Thirteen. The system of thirteen will come. You will open to it soon because you will move pa st time. The energy of thirteen moves beyond logic and beyond the forced system. N ow, as we have indicated, the Fam ily of Light has come onto the pl anet to receive energy from the Original Planners. This energy wi ll create a genetic alteration a nd reactivate and rebundle the light- encoded filaments. The filaments will make up the twelve-helix sy stem that can move the body into activation. This will make human be ings very valuable because they will then be ready to be used to access the data that is stored in Earth. What is this data that is so impor tant? It is disguised in insects a nd flowers and pigs and donkey tails and rabbit ears and all kinds of things, and it is for you to discover. We want to emphasize that when the data was stored in the twelve librarie s, it was stored in many different layers. When you came into the libraries, there were different codes of clearance. In other words, there were many different ways o f entering the libraries. You could not just walk in and say, \"I have free clearance to r eceive all of this information.\" Just as there is now security clea rance within your government , so the libraries holding this information had security systems. There was reason to build the libraries in the first place, for the pulsation of tyranny was beating at the time. There was concern on the part of certain energies, th e Keepers of Time, that information might get into the wrong hands. So, very playfully, libraries were designed in many di fferent modes. The othe r libraries, or worlds, are not at all like your world. The task for the Keepers of Time was to engineer a p roject through which consciousness could evolve, have informati on, and be utilized to access information. Originally; the role of the human occupant as th e way shower to the library was one of great honor. Without the human occu p ant, one could not access the librar y ; and the more tuned in the human"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"occupant was, the more one coul d access the library. The human occupa nt had a certain pride in being loose enough and connected enough to find the data in all things. If humans were the library cards, then some were better library car ds than others. There was training that went into being the library card, and when beings came who wanted to find information on the planet, they would merge with the human occupant who was coded to respond to certain codes. If someone had a low code, they might only see a certain amount of so mething; each one came with the purpose o f accessing specific information. Info rmation was not withheld from so meone because it was secretive, but because the information was not electromagnetically suited to their biological structure. Data must be able to penetrate th e belief system of an individual; otherw ise, the individual could blow up if they are overwhelmed with en ergy that is not strongly tempered with love. When something is strongly tempered with love, it pr events the individual fr om blowing apart and keeps them focused on receiving a very enlarged concept. This is how larg e concepts are transduced onto this planet: they ride the love frequency. Light frequency cannot carr y large concepts because it is not conn ected with emotion. Love frequency is connected with emotion. When an individual is crea ting an expanded concept of themselves, there must b e a love that gives the individual purpose. Without love, the individual does not feel there is purpose, and the individual must always feel connected with purpose to understand how vast things are. You are going to discover someday th at sex is part of the process. When you own your own sexuality, you will see the opportunities you have to express it, and you will decide whet her you want to express it in those ways or not. As you beco me accessible, and as others utilize you to di scover. the library, you may have very interesting encounter s as the years evolve. If you go back and study the scriptures and ancient manuscripts, you will understand that the gods came down and intermingled with the daughters of human beings. Sexuality has been used to spark the library card. Th ere is something very da ngerous in this, however, because it has been mi sused. That is why it is very important to own your sexuality and be very certain whom you share it with. We don't want any of you to be in a position to be bought or enticed. You are advised to look and see if you experi ence others as being honest and havi ng integrity or whether they are flattering you. You are beco ming stewards for power. There are traditionalists who feel we are making entirely too much information available without supervision. We say that Earth is headed for a major collision, so no holds barred. We are flooding the p lanet, as are many others, with opportunities to remember. So, as you begin to amass this knowledge and these abilities, th ere will be others attracted to you for th eir own reasons because of what they can access through you. When you are sexual with someone, it is like opening an avenue to the other libraries. It has to do with many, many things. Part of what we want all of you to do is love and honor your bodies, love yourself, and make certain that if you are going to be sexual wi th someone that the person really love you. It doesn't mean you are going to marr y them. But there has to be love so that you know who you are b onding with; in this way, the discove ries that you make move between the two of y ou. We are not so much warning you as we are informing you, because you will see things happe n to others who are not careful of their power. In other words, sexuality is not something to fool around with. It is a way to open many avenues. If one does not a pp roach it carefull y , one can attract ener g ies even without havin g a p artner. If one is usin g"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"sexuality to activate information, one could invite the wrong energies in. So be aware of the frequency of sexuality, because it brings up the emotions, and the emotions are the key to accessing the data that is stored in the Living Library.

By simply being in physicality, you are endowed with experiences and characteristics that you cannot gather anywhere else. To be part of phys icality on Earth at this particular time and dur ing the last 200,000 to 300,000 years is a very potent event indeed, because it means that you have come into a place where dar kness has been reigning. Yo u have had to struggle to open your eyes in any capacity and to recognize j oy and upliftment. If you think back over modern history, you will find that it has been a rare event indeed for people to have had uplifting lives. Therefore, you must birth upliftment for yourself, and you must convince yourself that you can do it. The nature of existence on Earth has been a struggle between light and darkness for many eons. Some would call it a struggle between good and bad, or upliftment and evil. We will simply say that it is an event and place where certain laws and rules exist and that Earth is certainly not the only place in existence that deals with these kinds of challenges. You are unique in that the biogene tic structure you operate Within has much greater capability than you have ever dreamed of. It is so interesting to watch you perform within these st ruggles, because you have b een convinced that you can utilize only a small percentage of your potential. In actuality, you are grand creatures designed in the image of gods. Even gift ed with this incredible potential, you have been controlled to such an extent that that potential has been denied its own existence. Most people use only 3 or 4 percent of their ca pabilities. Those who are more advanc ed may use 12 to 15 percent of thei r capabilities. Where does that leave most people? Where is the other 80 or 90 percent? What can that 90 p ercent of capabilities do? That 9o percent is awakening now, and the ancient eves are going to begin to remember and see what the self is capable of be ing. When the ancient eyes are open, a nd you recognize your true potential, you will stop ar guing with yourselves. You will st op arguing for limitation and will begin to move beyond the things that you insist on using to hold yourselves back. In ancient Egypt, it took many lifetimes for the ini tiates trained in the prie sthoods to completely open their eyes to other realities. They were trained to reincarnate into cer tain families and to remember who they were. Mothers and fa thers understood who they would be birt hing because they would dream of it.

You are renegades, so your society is not waiting for yo u to bring your gifts forward as it was in ancient Egypt. There is no place to put these talents to work within official dom, no sect within society. This is not how you are liv ing yet. So you will go at the p ace that the body and soul and mind deem appropriate for the use of your talents. Do not chastise yourself for not ac celerating at the rate that your ego deems appropriate. The ego has eyes that see one part of yourself . The soul, or the eyes of Horus that look through you, has a completely different vision of what is appropriate. Knowing your needs, your constituti on, and your blueprint, you will operate at a pace that will ke ep you intact. Mental institutions are filled with people who opened the ancient eves and couldn't make sense of it or figure it out ; they cannot find thei r home station. Without a p lace to plug into, the de licate balance of the nervous system is upset. You are rapidly developing your ner vous systems, and there are ways to recognize it. Every once in a while, you are able to catch the puls ation that takes you out of physical reality as you know it-out of the frequency that is third-dimensional identity. You are then able to move into another vibration and see, feel, and recognize that something out of the ordinary something extrao rdinary-is going on. It is usually then that denial comes in, because if the logical mi nd can't explain what is happening or get a grip on it, you deny the experience or block the memory of it. It is best if you stay in your intuition-if you rely on what you feel and, even though it may not make logical sense, operate wi th trust. Impatience is a trap for many of you because you feel you need to move somewhere. Don't deny the virtues of the tur tle who moves very slowly, stops to go inside and contemplate, is close to th e ground, and sees very well. When you desire an acceleration in this opening of the ancien t eyes, state your commitment. Thought is. Thought creates. If your thought is that you wish to move in to an acceleration with the greatest growth and ability, that is what you will do. When you doubt, that doubt is a thought, too, a nd it will also create itself. When doubt occurs, it st ops the expansion proc ess because you deny the subtlety of what is coming to you. You are in the decade that we have labeled \"the unnamed decade\": the 1990s. It is during this time that all the great events are going to begin to occur upon Earth. Many even ts have already been occurring, b ut they have been sequestered away in little co mpartmentalizations of offi cialdom. Officialdom is now outgrowing its own outfit and can no longer fit within its boundaries becau se it does not hol d reality as it truly is evolving, Those of you who are ancients-who are the masters aw akening as you awaken, we want you to be able to see out of the ancient eyes and to awak en something that you know, something that you remember, something that is deep inside. You are going to need to trust your self and rely upon yourself. You need to be able to see, to understand What you are seeing, and to translate the grander vision for others.

When you begin to take this process from the intellect and put it inside the b ody, and when you begin to commit to live your life this way, then the ancient eyes will really begin to see. As you begin to view your soul's history, your identity in this particular body-the \"I\"-may seem to be very insignificant. You had a magni ficent essence expressed on this pl anet in very ancient times, and there is so much more going on than you can presently perceive.

Honor each one, whether you are picking strawber ries in the fields or looking fo r cigarette butts on the street corners. Allow the aspect of self that carries the primor dial fire to express itself through you. You can still be the \"I\" when it is appropriate to be the \"I.\" Then, when the vastness of energy wishes to utilize your physical ve hicle as part of the plan to effect reality, the \"I\" is not annihilated. Instead, the \"I\" is incorporated: this is becoming mu ltidimensional. This is being able to move. You each know that you are here in a time sequence that is quite profound. The age th at has been written about, whispered about, and spoken about is upon you. It is the age when humanity physically mutates b efore your eyes and literally turns into something that it was not a short time before. What do human beings turn into? It is quite simple: human beings turn into mu ltidimensional beings. This is a big word and a big concep t. However, it is something that will be as familiar to you as tying your own shoes. Multidimensional humans are humans that consciously exist in many different places all at once. Humans are mutating or evolving into beings with the ab ility to flip from one station to another and to understand the grandne ss of who they are-that they do not end where their skin ends. Human beings do not end where the aura or etheric body ends; they exist in ma ny different realities. This is the age of the multidimens ional self: the self w ho can move with awaren ess in many different realities; the self who can even tually bilocate and disa ppear; the self who can move into fourth- dimensional consciousness-the perceiver, not the thinker. It is the age of the self who understands that the thinking portion of the self is ve ry important but that it is not to be the CEO of the physical body; it is to be an advisor. Intuition is the avenue that y ou are now being guided to cultivate to bring about a marriage o f consciousness. It is the marriage of the male aspect, which is logical, with the female aspect, which is feeling. It involves bringing th em together to become one. It is time to get moving. You are at a very crucial point, and it is time for a huge cha nge, a huge leap, a giving up, a releasing, and a letting go. It is time to completely allow light and spirit to move you throughout your existence, and time to let yourself become one with th e multidimensional aspects of sel f and portions of self that you have no idea exist.

All of the consciousnesses drawn to this planet at this time will begin a sp ark of evolution that will change the universal structure. Think big. Think really big and go for it. Who are these multidimensional selves? Many times y ou have been led to belie ve that there are othe r p ortions of yourself that are much more together than you are and that know much more than you do. To some extent that was true, and to some extent it is still true. Howe ver, you will find that in being the standard bearer of your soul, you will begin to activate data that is st ored inside of your body that carries your whole history. How will you know when thes e other aspects of self begin to show themselves? This can be very subtle, or it can be like being hit over the head with a two-by-four. It simply depends on the self. You may be sitting one day and find al l of a sudden that upon bli nking your eyes you are sitt ing in a different room. That is getting hit over the head with a two-by-f our. More subtly, you may be walking down the street looking at a window display when s uddenly a mannequin or picture or wo rd triggers something inside o f you; for a moment, you drift off and ge t a clear image of a simultaneous identity of yours-existing at the same time as you. You will begin to discover aspects of yourself that exist nonphysically, or parts of self that exist as b eings working in space who are truly space creatures. The soul is going to wake up. It will know every aspect of itself, and every aspect of the s oul's self will know of all of itself at once. You will be aware of all realities at once as you learn to ride the vibrational rate and become fourth dimensional. You will de velop this ability by first bala ncing three or four realitie s, then five or six, and so on. You are awakening Prime Creat or's abilities and will become your Prime Creator. Your Prime Creator's goal in creating this univers e and all other universes was to deve lop itself to such an extent and have so many multidimensional cha nnels of data open that it-whose consciousness is in all things you know-could become aware of itself in all things, aware of every event that all th ings are involved in, and compute this and not go insane. You are evolving that ability in your selves. Basically, the part that you are presen tly going through is the toughest part because you are doubti ng and wondering if it is really real. The body says one thing and the mind says another. The body says one thing and society says anot her. The knowing is growing, and it is a knowing of what is awakening inside of you. You must be committed all of the time. When these g ifts and abilities be g in to be firsthand ex p eriences"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"for you, you must learn to work with them no matter what. Begin to know that you are divinely guided and that all events are drawn to you for your upliftment no matter what kind of upheaval they seem to p roduce in your life. Ultimately, thes e events will make you richer. The present situation is like someone dumping barrels full of gol d in your back yard and you saying, \"Gos h darn it, the gold is wrecking the grass.\" You think the lawn isn't as beautiful as it us ed to be because all of that gold is being dumped there. Whenever you get an experience, le arn to participate in it; be a full participant in your physical body. Enjoy it, have a good time wi th it, and learn how to simultaneously observe your experience, the impact of your experience, the ef fect your experience has on other people and yourself, and the results you get from all of your experiences. Then, whenever something of an extraordinary nature comes into being, you can say to yourself, \"Oh, goody, goody-here it is again. What can I learn from this?\" When you are not having these experiences, begin to fa ntasize, to take charge of your life, and to act as if you can command or m ove one of these experi ences the next time it sneaks up on you. You can do this the same way you may have learned to come awake in a dream and command that you not be chased b y boogie men or to make the bell ri ng when you are just about to get an \"F.\" You must, as individuals and as a species, cultivate th is kind of belief or intenti on over all experiences of life. There is a convergence of your se lves about to occur on this planet. The selves that you are going to meet are coming from all over the universe. There ar e selves that petrify you when you think about them and selves that you could die of a heart attack looking at. They are selves that are you. Earth is going through an initiation at this time. You are going through an init iation because you are part of Earth, and you cannot separate yourself from this system. Ea rth is transforming itself and intending to act as a domino for your solar system. It is intending to merge multiple worlds into one , to be grounded enough to allow all those worlds to exist, and to translate the experience. This is what Ea rth is up to. So, of course , you all must be up to the same thing. The 3-D world is headed for a co llision of dimensions -not a collision of worlds, a collision o f dimensions. Many dimensions are going to come cras hing into each other. So me of these dimensions may seem horrifying and very frightening. The test, the initiation-and initiati on always means to move through another reality to conquer it and transmute it-is to be faced with these en ergies and entities that seemingly are of incredible darkness and to unders tand that they are coming to merge with you because they are you. They are part of your mul tidimensional self, and you are the standard bearer, and you are light. Dark will come to light. Be very clear when you deal with these things. If you are hesitating about something, do not do it. Be clear. We define light as the promoting, dispensing, and sharing of in formation. Dark is the controlling and withholding of information. Think a bout this and feel it. You have co me onto this planet with a coded b lueprint to carry light and to br ing about a huge planet ary transformation. You ha ve come to be the standard bearer of your soul, the portion of your soul that is going to lead. That por tion of your soul says, \"I set the pace here, and the pace is light and information; no more being in the dark.\" Have you ever thought that there are portions of yourself that are in the dark that don't know how to find the light except through you? They wa nt the light as well. They want solutions and answers. What you may feel is not necessarily the inte nt of the dark force but the emot ional makeup of the dark force-the fear that vibrates out of lack of information. Portions of y ourself that are uninformed are g oin g to come"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"to you to be informed. How do you inform them? You shed light; you share light. You say, \"I intend fo r all of my other selves to come along on this journey a nd for them to get light as well.\" It is quite simple. The battle between light and da rk doesn't really serve you. It is part of the separation stor y that keeps you confused. In actu ality, there are simply aspects o f individual souls taking different gui ses in conflict with themselves. You are batt ling yourself. The battle of light and dark and good and evil is only be tween portions of yoursel f. These portions are multidimensional extensions or reincarnations of the same collective of energies that you are a part of as an individual. Because you don't understand something, you fear it. As separated forms of consciousness that are part of Prime Creator's game, you are in a universe that is made up of dualities. Prime Creato r b rought this universe into being with the components of free will so that free will could lead to chaos and then to a realignment of energy and a re alization of the Creator within all things. With free will, all things are allowe d and oppositions occur. These oppositi ons split off of the self just as the Prime Creator is in all things and allows all things. Th e things you meet that you fear are you. So when you focus on the story of good and evil and want to figure it out, all you need to realize is that you are playing ball with another aspect of yourself that allows you to pl ay ball from your point of view. So-called evil serves a great purpose. You just judge it because it s eemsbad. As member s of the Family of Light, when you exist in other places, you move into various aspects of yourse lf and play the parts to p erfection. When you came here, you entered the density of the planet and worked with the double helix, which is barely functioning, so you forgot many things. Now, as you come awake and realize what you can become, you are leading yourselves toward the realization that you are your enemy. As members of the Family of Light, you have access to a treme ndous amount of understanding that others do not have. You came in with it, you are being reminde d of it, and you are now learning it and accepting it. Part of your task is to allow yourself to merge with your selves that seemingly are you r enemies and are separated fro m you. These selves are within all variet ies of existence. The task is also for you to carry the fre quency of love, which is the frequency of creation, and light, which is the frequency of information, throughout the collection of your soul. You have come together as a soul to gather experience and enrich Prime Creator. As you separate, you go off and act with free h ill however you choose, without j udgment, so that you can gather the proper information and bring you to wholeness. This good-and-evil thing is some thing that can entrap you if you do not get beyond it. You are a collection of an incredible wealth of personalities who incarnate in many different syst ems of reality. As members of the Family of Light, you come into this reality to bri ng information, and you do so in many different systems. There are versio ns of yourself that are doing the sa me thing within the communities o f lizards, insect bei ngs, or bird beings. You are a collection of personalities. As members of the Family o f Light, the reincarnational experience of yourself includes nonhuman forms. A characteristic that members of the Family of Light have in common with one another is thei r p articipation in many versions of sentient or composite reality. Many of the forms that you have chosen to incarnate within would look very foreign and be very frightening to you, yet this is how you have evolved your soul. You do not incarnate in only one species; you are trav elers. As you are in disguise as humans, you may be in dis guise as lizards or something else. Y ou do this so that you can unite yoursel f to understanding the essence of Prime Creator through a variety of species that seemingly have nothing in common."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"As members of the Family of Light, you know the inside scoop. Y ou come as ambassadors to make realities merge and become more in formed within themselves so that everyone involved can release fea r and become uninhibited. Part of your job is to meet these other selves, to merge with them, and to feel what this is like. Ideally, you will b ecome multidimensional travelers and will be able to take the force from your body. You maybe working in the field, perhaps gardening or chatting with someone o r p icking strawberries, and something strikes you a sound. You excu se yourself and say, \"I am being called. I will return later.\" You go and sit and al low your current Earth pers onality to depart. With conscious awareness, you then take th at personality to where it is needed to add to the Family of Light's capability in that reality. You will know it. You will all become multidimensi onal players. You will think nothi ng of it when one of you excuses yourself from the others when you hear the tone and are called. You will tr avel with conscious awareness, and entertainment will come from the self. You will not seek to read books or listen to tapes or go to movies, for you will be living those things. As you bring th e abilities of the Family of Light to this planet, others are not going to want you to be here, because you will not fit with their gods. N ot everyone wants to be free. You, as members of th e Family of Light, are goi ng to create a new Earth that is going to be free. Those who do not wish to be free will have their Earth as well. There will be a splitting and a time of sepa ration. Members of the Family of Light know that there is no need to force anything. You are simply to work together in harmony, to support one another, and to seek one anothe r out so that you feel comfort in what you do becaus e some of the things th at you do will be very outrageous. Each of you volunteered to come here at this time to carry a frequency. At th is time, that frequency is light, but eventually you will learn how to carry the frequency of l ove. The large majority of you have no idea what the love frequency can be. You talk about love and light, yet you do not comprehend the ramifications and the true meanings of them. Light is information; love is creatio n. You must become informed before you can create. Do you understand this? As you grow and come to these higher realms of recognition, you will break through what feels like cement blockslayers of yourself th at have held you down. Think of th e frequency that has limited the human experiment as a radio st ation. The human experiment has had one radio station on for 300,000 years. Same old tunes! The human experiment was unable to turn the dial and hear a different band, so the same frequency was broadcast. This created a quarantine-a sealing off of this planet. The creative cosmic rays sent by Prime Creator and the Original Pla nners pierce through this frequency shield. They bombard Earth. Howeve r, they must have someone to receive them. Wit hout a receptacle, these creative cosmic rays would create chaos and confusion. You, as members of the Family of Light, come into this system to receive these ra ys of knowledge. You then di sseminate the knowledge, the new lifestyle, and the new frequenc y to the rest of the population to alter the entire planet. As members of the Family of Ligh t, you are here to anchor frequency and allow the mutation process to happen inside of your bodies so that you can make it available to the planet. Yo u live this process, then you broadcast it to the pl anet. What does that mean? It means th at eventually your reality is going to change and that how you deal with reality will change. You will stop being you, as you know you, and will become more connected with all of the other yous who are l ooking to make the same leap in consciousness as this you!

There is no reaching higher knowle dge without going through the multidimensional self. This means coming into full realization and ex periencing, meeting, and merg ing with a collective o f intelligence existing in the eve r-expanding now, beyond space and time. Believe us when we say that you, as members of the Family of Light, made a vast study of the historical manipulation that has been going on on this planet, ju st as anyone sent on assi gnment would be trained for a long period of time be fore they were sent out into the fi eld. Each of you has been trained, and you have the knowledge inside you. Our part is to hit key chords and play your consciousness into activity so you can go ahead and make the tune or song or dance you are prepared for. Your knowledge is inside o f you, and as you agree to discover it, it will awaken on deeper and deeper levels. You will become very selfsufficient, those of you who ag ree to this. You will also become incredibly knowledgeable, those o f you who do not stop because you are frightened. We will say to you very honest ly that fear will always play a part in your evolutionary process, so get used to it. Do not feel that fear is bad. When you succumb to your fears and allow yourself to buy into them, then you must cycle through th em and experience all you feel so that you can overcome them.

(8) Chapter Eight Outside the Ultimate Tyranny Content of „Bringers of the Dawn“, pg. 87 - 96, Chapter Eight. The ultimate tyranny in a society is not control by martial law. It is control by the psychological manipulation of consciousness, thr ough which reality is defined so th at those who exist within it do not even realize that they are in pris on. They do not even realize that th ere is something outside of where they exist. We represent what is out side of what you have been taught exists. It is where you sometimes venture and where we want you to dwell; it is outside of where society has told you you can live. You have been controlled like sheep in a pen by those who think they own you-from the government to the World Management Team to th ose in space. You have been de prived of knowledge by frequency control. Think of frequency as individual broadcasting and receiving through which you dial into the station of your choice. It is the broadcasting of carri er waves of intelligence. The range of frequency is unlimited, and the ran g e of intelli g ent matter transmitted is unlimited."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Frequency control limits the number of stations you can tune into. As members of the Family of Light, you must anchor new frequencies through static chaos and bring them into the physical realm. The range of accessibility on this planet to a variety of frequencies has been very minimal for a long time because of many things that you most desperately need to become aware of. As you learn about your own p ersonal history and discover patterns of ineffectual behavior that you must br eak and change, the planet p ulses through its own patterns of be havior. You are about to repeat history as a planet in a most dramatic way. You have come to alter and rem ove the frequency of limitation and to bri ng in the frequency o f information. When you are inform ed, you move beyond the need to be in fear. When you feel uninformed and out of control, you do not understand the bigger picture. Each of you came to awaken something inside yourself, inside the coding of your being-the DNA-and you are responding to it. This is why you are on a search in all directions of your life. You and multitudes of others have begun the mutation process on the planet. As you mutate electromagnetically, you alter your frequency or the tune that you broadcast. You will eventually outgrow the frequency that holds you down and c ontinually blasts you with chaos and confusion. Eventually, when you alter, carry, and maintain your own frequency, you will vibrate differently and thus affect everyone around you. They will feel the availab ility of this frequenc y alteration, which will then move like a wave around the planet. As the plan et accepts this new frequency that you have worked very hard to obtain, those at the end of the domino chain will receive it. This new frequency is called knowledge, light, and information. It is called be ing taken out of bondage. You are being taken out o f disinformation and misinformation and you are becoming informed; you are coming into light. As each of you has been assigned to become informed and to bring about a frequency alteration on this p lanet, you must learn to become Keepers of Freque ncy. You must rise to a certain place of knowledge and consistently stay there. Y ou must become in command of your body so that you can will it into stillness or into activit y. You must be able to go inside yourse lf and heal what needs to be healed emotionally and physically. You must begin to part the jungle of self and fi nd the clearing so that you can show others the way. Sometime s you will show others the way not by speaking to them, but just by maintaining, living, and working on your own frequency and having the courage to do this. As systems busters and potential Keepers of Fr equency, you will obviously go into the areas where you r specialties are most needed. Many of the beings who have incarnated as members of the Family of Light came to the United States because this is the land where you can make the most progress. This also happens to be a land where denial is pervasive. You be lieve that you live in the land of the free and the home of the brave, yet you live in the most controlled experimental society on the planet. The tyranny that has been set up here is rather interesting, because it is a tyranny without walls. As a country and a collective consciousness, the United States still has not reached an awareness that something is not right. The environment of the United States is actually much more controlled than that of the former Soviet Union, where the control was obvious. Because everyone is so frightened of giving up the system in the Unit ed States, they are going to be f orced to give it up. The system is co rrupt, it does not work, it does not honor life, an d it does not hono r Earth. That is the bottom line. If something does not honor life and does not honor Earth, you can bet it is going to fall, and it is going to fall big time. Consciousness must change. This is part of the Divine Plan, and this opportunity and se tup are not going to be missed. There has been an overinvolvement in the material world and a complete lack o f understanding of the nonphysical world that exists al l around you, so there will be a reprioritizing o f what comes first in life.

People will awaken to the incredible potential of themselves. In the next few years, a connectedness and communa l cooperation will begin to run through this country so that you will stop separating yourselves with respect to poli tical ideology. That separation was designed. Whenever a people are sepa rated, and they focus on what they do not have in common or label themselves different from others, it is a perfect di sguise to keep them from discovering what they do have in common. This separation keeps people fr om banding together and becoming very strong. Much of the political maneuvering going on, particular ly in the United States , is purposely designed to separate you. Look at the New Age. Do you see how the New Age is separated? Al l kinds of things are said to keep you from discovering what you have in common. When people discover this, they will b egin to get angry. As more and mo re of the methods of control and separation are revealed to you, the anger will build in the United Stat es. Events will occur that may look as if the country is falling apart, yet they will serve the purpose of bringing people t ogether. A new pride and a new sense of integrity will come about, because this is what is designed for the times. The material realm is one area that ever yone relates to. Life in the Unit ed States translates into how much money you have in your pock et and how much money the government wants out of what you have in your pocket. Taxes will be the issue that will create both the greatest am ount of havoc in the United States and the greatest amount of unificat ion, because you all have taxes in common. You may not worship the same God, but you all pay taxes. In a clever move, the Middle East crisis allowed the government to ha ve what it wanted without going through the problem of asking your permission for a tax ra ise on gasoline. You see how clever these things are? With a few more taxes piled on top of one another, people will begin to examine the quality of their lives. You will see a lot of anger in th is country, because many peop le will feel powerless. Anger is one of the first emotions that will occur when people fi nally understand the manipulation that has been going on and begin to get in touch with their feelings. Modern technology is one of the bigge st weapons of frequency control. You have been sold devices fo r entertainment and convenience, a nd they are all involved with fr equency control. We recommend strongly that you get rid of your television sets. They are the pr imary tool used to manipulate you r consciousness on a day-to-day basis. This experiment is so finely tuned that you respond subliminally to disease via the television. So there is an entire generation that is ki lling itself by watc hing television-and supporting the medical societ y while they are doing it. Sometimes liberating information is broadcast-perhaps even a New Age show. However, you may watch such a television show about how uplifted and unlimited you can be, while subliminally you are being hit with a frequency that keeps you from original thinking. This subliminal keeps you immobilized and holds you in a \"survive, arrive, be-on-time, be-sile nt, go-towork\" society. Television also promotes inactivity and a sedentary, obese life. Look around you. Wake up, humans! Most of the subliminals on tele vision are done through technology that was developed in conjunction with off-planetary beings. The use of subliminals to upset hum an consciousness has become a worldwide program. If you think about the houses that have two, three, and four televisions in them, you must agree that this has been a very successful marketing program. Some people who know about the subliminals on television f eel that they are immune to them. However, the ef fects of television are so p ermeating that no matter how cl ear you say you are going to be, you cannot counterbalance what the technolo gy is p resentl y doin g to y our vibrational fre q uenc y ."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"We have said that there are entit ies who feed off your emotional bodies.

They don' t have to have too many wars anymore to get you all riled up -they can simply make movies! People who need to watch television are not tapping into the wealth of information within their minds and immediately accessible all around them . As a matter of fact, if you re ally want to evolve, do not read your newspapers, do not listen to the radio, and do not watch television. If you are able to be media free for periods of time, and you disengage yourself from the frequency of chaos a nd anxiety and stress and hustle- b ustle and temptations of all kinds that you don't need, you begin to get clear. You begin to listen to what is going on inside of yourse lf and to live in the world and not necessarily be lost in it. You become clear. We cannot emphasize this enough! Electronics also jam your freque ncy. Even when they are not specifically designed to jam you r frequency, sometimes there is incompatibility be tween the electronic fre quency of something and yourself. Plus, as we said, many of th em are designed to crea te static so that you will always stay at a certain vibratory rate, turning you into sa fe, harmless, inactive, productive cattle. What about computers? The second most predominant piece of hardware in the United States is the computer. How many of you go to work on computers and end up gett ing headaches, particularly when you work for large corporations and are hooked up to their mainframe? Large companies are into aspects of mind control; they use your minds to generate energy to achieve something for themselves. Personal computers are not as potent and powerful. Some new inventions are going to surface in the ni netiesvery underground inve ntions, because they will never be given patents to be promoted in the marketplace. Ther e will be a whole underground economy b ased upon barter, in which certain i nventions will be traded between people. There will be technologies that can counteract much of the fr equency control: these technologie s can change the quality of your ai r and water, and they can eliminate and seal off your home so that you are an in tegral of energy and nothing can bombard you. There are technologies that do phenomena l things. Do you understand how technology has been used agains t you? It has not been used for you. Television is not ne cessarily bad in itself, but it has been put to ill pur pose. There is nothing wrong with technology. I t is now technology is being used that is the bottom line. That is the difference. The education system is another ar ea where you are controlled. Most of what you are taught is malarkey. You work hard, take loans out, and pay money to lear n something that is antiquated before you even set foot in the door, particularly in the realms of scientific, mathem atical, psychologi cal, and medical exploration. What do you do when you live in a society that rewards you for degrees? You begin by saying, \"I believe that I formulate my world. I believe that I do not need these credentials to define my existence. I can be unique unto myself, sovereign unto myself.\" Co me up with a me thod or way to explore the world without degrees. Educ ation is actually the pursu it of knowledge, and knowledge can come from a wal k in the desert. It does not have to come from flipping pages in a book. It is not harmful to explore a little bit of schooling, but don't buy into the idea th at what you are being taught is correct. You are controlled and separated by i ssues that strike at the core of your emotions. The abortion/pro-life issue is not a global issu e, it is a national issue. Sometimes it does look as if innocent victims are trampled or stampeded by ev ents that seemingly have nothing to do with them. Of course, that is what y ou have been tau g ht-that y ou are p owerless and can onl y be saved b y the mood of the g ods, which has"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"never been the case. Those who find thei r lives taken by accident or violence select it. The pro-life/abortion issue has been purposely orchestrated in the United States by different factions within the government to create a lack of harmony. Divide and conquer, and you own the people. Allow the people choice, freedom, and the ability to c ontinuously improve their lives, and you cannot own them. Whenever people oppose people, those in contro l benefit, even down to the issue over abortion. How do they benefit? They keep women from uniting with each ot her and men from uniting with each other here in the United States . They keep people in fear. They convince you, by continuously putting these issues before you, that a woman has no cont rol over the birthing process in her body. You don't need abortion: you never need to get pregnant in the first place if y ou don't desire it. How? By will. A woman can say to herself, \"I am not prepared at this time for a child.\" Or, alternately, \"I am in receptivity of a child.\" When you own yourself, you will not need perm ission from the government about what you can do with your own body. Violence on the streets of major cities is another subtle means of cont rol. The big cities in the United States-Los Angeles, New York City, Washington, D.C ., and so on-are energy buckets, or holes, where energy comes into the North American continent-or has up until now. There has been an increase in violence in these cities because it is known that if unrest can be kept brewing a nd reported, it can be a likely vehicle for manipulating th e entire nation. These things ar e purposely set into motion on the p hysical level and assisted on the ethe ric level because the mo re fear that is generated the more those in charge can feed on it. When a woman goes out with her family and is assaulted, and her young son, a seemingly innocent victim, fights the assailan ts and goes down by knife an d dies totally unexpected ly on his vacation, the fear that is promoted throughout multitudes of people feeds many. The fear that the war in the Middle East brought about was phenomenal. You have been raped of your life force. If there is anything that you as memb ers of the human species have in common it is that you have been raped for your emotions. Othe rs have played your emotions as though they were instruments, and they have never let you know the pow er you have with you r emotions. Always this whole story comes back to emotions. Emotions are like tickets that can get you places and p lug you in. You are incredib ly rich. If you would onl y realize how wealthy you are with your emotions. The lower vibratory beings, if we ma y be so bold as to call them that, exist off emotions in a very small range of frequency-emotions that are based on fear, chaos, and violence. The ability to use the human will over the human mind is your ultimate resource. This ability to maste r the body according to your will is ex actly what the people in charge of the planet do not want you to figure out. As more of you become sovereign and in charge of your own frequency, those who do not want the new frequency here will bring an opposite frequency to cr eate chaos, confus ion, and polarity. Always, whenever a society is on the verge of a huge leap or change, there are diametrically opposed activities. Always look at an issue from the pers pective of the bigger picture so that you have neutrality with it, fo r the picture gets bigger and bigger all the time. The planet is head ed for a major confrontation with certain entities. We are simply pointing this out; we ar e not here to promote fear . Fear is what the othe r team wants y ou to feel.

Earth's owners have not wanted hum ans to understand that their feeli ngs and emotions are like a crop, such as wheat, that can be harves ted. If you are in charge of your own harvest, then others cannot take advantage of you and use you unle ss you decree it. When you operate with a certain frequency and sovereignty, those who wish to cont rol you are not interested in yo u. They want a fearful, chaotic frequency, which is what nourishes them. Fear a nd chaos have predominated on this planet because these entities have stir red them up. They have divided and conquered everywhere to create that frequency. When you operate in peace and love and with information, you alte r the structure of this p lace drastically: you bring choice of frequency back to this planet.

Since you are a frequency-controlled society, the ability of humanity to create technologies has been limited. In a less controlled societ y that has greater outreach or tr avel capabilities through space and greater interchange betw een systems, technological advances are quite astounding and uplifting. Many gifts and influences from outside this planet have been hushed up. Some information has, of course, b een given to the planet in many different ways, a nd the resulting technologies have brought about great changes in lifestyle. One of the changes in lifestyle th at occurred during this century was the introduction of movies. A whole new way of influenc ing thought was brought to th e planet by the film indus try. Just as there is a movie industry on this planet, th ere are those in space who have a holographic industry. They make holographic inserts-dramas that look just like th ey are realand insert th em through portals into you r reality. Since these space beings have been around for hundreds of thousands of years, and humanity's frequencies have been controlled, it is quite easy to hoodwink human beings.

As we see it, those who use the holographic inserts are not always afte r bringing light or info rmation or upliftment to p eople. They have ulterior motives, although they may pass them off as light. Holographic experiences, es pecially viewings in the sky, are set up to influence a large group of people at once. Many, though not all, UFO sightings ha ve been holographic inserts. There have been holographic inserts of one individual, designed in many fashions, projected simultaneously in many different cultures. That is why some of Earth's religi ous stories are parallel from one corner of the world to another when there was no physical contact. Holographic inserts look exactly li ke 3-D reality. They are creati ons of events manufactured and inserted in your reality to look as if they are part of a sequential action. They are used to influence the minds of observers, and they are very difficult to r ecognize. You will have plenty of practice in the next number of years when-in the Middle East and other areas around this pl anet-a lot of ex traterrestrial activities come into full force and begin to be published. Some of the grand events will be very legitimate, and some of th em will be inserts designe d to move the consciousness of humanity toward the one world order to be controlled. Holographic inserts have energy fi elds and can be dowsed. Dowsing rods move differently in them b ecause their energy fields are dive rse and vibrate at an incredible rate. You can walk into them and p articipate in them. People may be part of them and swear they are real. But they are orchestrated events designed to influence the minds of humans. Holograp hic inserts are not done for information, they are done for control. They are simply an aspect of technology that exists. R ealities can be constructed and inserted just like movies. Movies, tele vision, and so on are your version of creating reality. There ar e other, very evolved beings who clever ly create realities so \"real\" that you can't tell the difference. They are like beams. Just like spotlights are projected into the night, holographic inserts are projected onto this planet through porta ls. Tremendous energy is ne eded because the process involves the merging of dimensions . The technology does not exist in th e third dimension, it exists in other dimensions, and they n eed the dimensional fusions. What is the difference between dimensions? Why is one dimension important to another? Because each dimension has a diffe rent vibratory rate or way the molecu les move. These holographic inserts need p laces where the dimensions are alr eady merged because they need to play through the other dimensions in order to enter here. Humanity has been blind and hoo dwinked over and over again because of the unevolved helixes that information could not plug into. The Family of Light has come to chan ge all of that. You are here to carry a new frequency on th e planet and hold it in you r bodies so the rest of the planet can begin to vibrate at the same frequency. That frequency is going to create disr uption of the structures based on two-stranded DNA on this planet. It cannot help it; it is time to evolve. Earth is ready to go through whatever is necessary for that evolution. Human beings must learn to read energies. They must learn to us e more than the senses of their eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and so on to perceive reality. We ha ve said that the eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and sense of touch are deceivers of reality. They lock reality in. You think you are perceivi ng reality with these senses when in actuality they lim it your perceptions of reality. You have been trained since you were a child to rely on your eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and sense of touch to interpret experience.

In the deepest core of your being, there is an integrity you can discover and begin to operate with. It is an integrity that honors life and honors yourself first and foremost as the life that you are in charge of.

That is why we say that humani ty is in for a drastic awakening as far as what is really real. The boundaries of reality are quite profound. We talked about the portal in th e Middle East being a di mensional doorway or entryway onto the planet for certain energies to find ci vilization. Remember, when you leav e a planetary sphere and go into space, once you traverse certain be lts of consciousness you must fi nd the proper portal to come bac k onto the planet in the precise tim e period or corridor of time that you are looking for. This is how systems are kept locked and intact, and how they ar e prevented from being raid ed and taken over. There are portals on the South American continent, the No rth American continent, Asia, China, and all ove r the globe. The huge portal that we are presently discussing is the port al in the Middle East. It is gigantic. Many holographic inserts or dramas have been inserted through that portal to upset the minds and b eliefs of the population. Sin ce this portal is in the midst of crisis , it is a prime candidate for holographic inserts and also prime for a belief system to alter this chaotic world and get everyone to move in a different direction. Be aware of your feeling centers when these kinds of events begin to occur on this p lanet. The Middle East is a portal where ma ny dimensions meet and where enti ties from other dimensions can come onto this planet. It is a hot spot. In recent times, in the last forty or fi fty thousand years, many civilizations have surfaced and many religious dramas have started in the Mi ddle East. Because of the vortex, holographic inserts are easier to produce in that area, just like movies are easier to produce in California."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"A potential holographic insert in this portal is the arrival of extrat errestrials from space. Or Christ returning. Or some god returning, or some savior, or some reason fo r everyone to begin to follow one way of thinking. At this tim e, as we see it, it is not of light. An example of a hologra phic insert that was p ut on the planet in the past to ch ange the course of hist ory is the crucifixion of Christ. The drama that was played out and passed on historical ly to you is not the reality that th e Christed One came in to play. A version of this entity's life was molded and designed in a holographic entertai nment movie, which was then inserted and played out as if it were real. Christ came in as a committee of beings over a period of time. The story that you have been told is a dramatized, marketed version-a very controlled version of who this enti ty was and is. Part of the Christ drama you have been taught was a holographic insert. And part of what you will discover in the future about the Christed One has the poten tial of being another holographic insert. So be aware. Most people would say that we are sacrilegious and of the devil to say this. Ho w can we question what the Bible says? How can we question all of these things? Be cause they were all said and done by patriarchal organizations that promoted themse lves. That was all they were. Th ey were utilized to bring bac k control of the energy on the planet. In reality, the Christed One was sent as a systems bu ster, a member of the Family of Light, to bring light through the portal in the Middle East. This created a way for many to enter and seed a reality that would p repare the consciousness of humanit y for the cycle that will terminat e in approximately the next twenty years, depending upon how events pr oceed. The Christed One came not as one entity but as a number o f entities, influencing people in humanity's dark hour, an hour when human beings were ready to understand their mysteries. One of the things that wa s not promoted to you in a very truthful way was that the Christed One was very well accepted. The kind of energy that the Christed beings brought to the p lanet was received very well. There are a number of dramas going on with the Christ en tity. There is the original blueprint: the plan o f the Christed committee to come in, to spread light or information, and to show humans what the human b ody is capable of doing. Then there are the beings w ho said, \"What are we going to do about this? This one is coming in our portal, and we want control over this portal. Ho w are we going to be able to use this energy? It is a free-will universe, and we can do what we want.\" So they created a holographic insert of the drama of Christ bei ng crucified to create fear and emotion out of someone else's intentions and to move consciousness in a way that wa s not originally intended at all. This means that in a free-will universe it is possible, particular ly in portal areas, for one group of gods to raid another\"s story and insert their own version of it. At the time, perhaps, this does not affect many, alt hough over time the impact of the holographic in sert is eventually known. We know this is frustrating for many of you. Yet wh at we are doing by sharing this information with you is getting you to move , feel, remember-and not think so much. This is not a process of logical thinking, it is a process of fe eling.

Light is underestimated, and it is a good thing, because light is going to liberate you all. You have an exciting assignment-an enviable job- and you have all the help you are going to need to complete your task. There has been a tremendous influx of entities and mother ships on this planet that are now acting as intermediaries or perhaps literal transducers of energy. The beams of light that come to the planet come from old and ancient star system s that have been working with Earth for eons and eons. Many of them are simply numbered by your astr onomers, while others have names you are familiar with-Sirius, Arct urus, Orion, the Pleiades, a nd so on. Beams of light ar e being caught by quite a number of mother ships surrounding Earth, filtered through an entire ly different system, and then b lasted onto the planet. Many of you have implants inside of you to respond to this communication and to bypass psychotronic warfare and interference that would keep your frequencies jammed and prevent you from being able to rece ive this information. These implants ar e not negative. You were not abducted and probed to receive them against your will. They are etheric implan ts that you called to yourself as tools to receive off-planet energi es. These implants are being ac tivated now. Many of you are finding that you are feeling altered. At diff erent times of the day, particul arly when you are going to sleep, you are hearing a variety of tone s or feeling a kind of elect ric vibration in your body. When this information is beamed to you, your body must be able to receive it. In order for your body to receive it, it must be in a certain state. The info rmation is like a current, and if your body cannot handle the current it moves into a state of discomfort. The people of Earth were programmed for this time, and there is no one incarnated upon the planet who can sa y that they made a mistake and did not know what was going to occur here. No one was born upon this planet w ithout a mechanism inside of them that can be activated to tune into or turn on to the ability to house these frequencies. We have encouraged many of you to move out of the logical mind because the logical mind will come into conflict with this info rmation and electronic energy. In the next number of years, you r understanding and vibration with the frequencies comi ng to you will be like turning on your own radio. You will have a direct telepathic link with mother ships broadcas ting to you. There will come a time when you will never even think of going to a ch anneling session because you will have your own linkup with information. The wealth of inform ation that will come to you will be of great reassura nce; it will be broadcast to fill you in on what is happening.

The Bringers of the Dawn are those who carry the rays of the sun and bring light and knowledge. They have an anci ent organization, an ancient society, an ancient spiritual bonding that k eeps them doing certain wo rk within a certain star system. You are members of the Bringers of the Dawn; otherwise you would not be drawn to this book. The members o f this elite organization come to Earth at different ti mes to do their work. This occurs when a cycle has b een set and events are perfect for them to allow the energy from the high cosmos and the energy from Earth to merge within their own beings. The energies from the cosmos ar e always coming to Earth, and the energies from Earth are always lifting up toward the cosmos. Humanity creates the sacred bridge between Ea rth and sky, which some have called the rainbow bridge. The Bringers of the Dawn allow these energies to merge so that the dawn, or the light, is awakened within them. They then bri ng that dawn to civilizations. This is who you are. This is what you are doing. So are multitudes of others. You are the Bringers of the Dawn. As Bringers of the Dawn, there is a certain stance th at will facilitate the co mmitment you have made. This stance is one of allowing and moving out of self-indulgenc e and the discounting of you r experiences. For the Bringers of the Dawn, each link makes up the whole, no matter how it is constructed, no matter what strengt h or weakness it has, and no matt er how big or small its role. Strength or weakness or influence ar e not necessarily to be compared; they are simply the stance that consciousness, in its own dance of reality, chooses to focus upon. We teach you about yourselves and assist you in unlocki ng what is inside of you, not what is outside o f you. As Bringers of the Dawn, you are in your darkest hour before the dawn, wh en you may wonder i f there is going to be a ray of light. Then, almost in stantly, the light will begi n to show from nowhere. Where will it come from? How will it change your thinking? How is ex istence as dark as it can be one moment, and then the next instant there is light? As Bringers of the Dawn, you will that light to dawn. You were trained for this; it is your forte. You, the Bringers of the Dawn, al so known as the Family of Light, agreed to go through the process o f mutation to evolve yourselves into higher beings by intention and conscious agreement. You bring light b ack to the planet, bring about the new evolution of humanit y, and make the cosmic evolutionary leap in awareness and intelligence possible by anchoring th e frequency first inside your own bodies and living it. The Family of Light comes from a centr al place of operation-a source within this universe that acts as a b roadcast station. There are central suns within your galactic system and a central sun within this universe. The Mayans named this central sun Alcyone. Others know it by other names. The sun has light, and light has information. To make this very simplistic, memb ers of the Family of Light come from a place that is the central stor ehouse of information for the universe. You cycle or spiral out from this central sun and carry the inform ation from it throughout the various s y stems in this universe; y ou p lot, p lan, and travel.

You sometimes incarnate in these systems for hundreds of thousands of years in preparation for the time when you may be called on to bust the systems. You have a resume to back you. For example, you incarnate on Earth a number of times soy that if the call goes out that Earth is going to be busted open and the paradigm is going to be shifted, you can sa y, \"I have been there 24 7 times, in this many varieties, and once I was able to ascend my body.

However, when al l goes according to plan and you succeed in busting the system and creating a new paradi gm of light, it is like a cosmic orgasm to you. Members of the Bringe rs of the Dawn or the Family of Light work in teams. You don't go into systems alone. You need each other to do this work b ecause you cannot hold the frequency by yourself. By going in as teams, you increase the odds of successful ly carrying out the plan. You are like rays and light spirals of the central sun th at are very intelligent, and you are guided by a great intelligence inside the central sun. Light is a kingdom of consciousness, and it has a purpose in existence. The story we tell you today is a story that you can comprehend. Every time we spea k to humans and you comprehend more, we give you more. We do not want you to think that light is more noble than anything else. Something in the essence of your soul connects you to this light source and dr ives you to this profession, but it does not make this p rofession better than any other pr ofession. There are others who have different sources and spiral out with different intentions, and they make the ballgame possible. You are learning about this. We remind you that Prime Creat or creates it all, and it endows all things with itself. Just as you are seeking self awareness, Prime Creator is mastering this as well. It seeks to be aware of itself within all things and to endow the things that it is within with awareness that Prime Creator is in them and aware of its existence. The awareness is like a mirror going back and fo rth between Prime Creator and all creations, down to the smalle st little bug or ant that crawls on the ground. Just as Prime Creator is in light, it is also in so-called evil, knowing that \"evil\" also has a divine purpose. Many kingdoms of consciousn ess exist. \"Kingdoms of consciousne ss\" are fancy words for a concept that we would like you to grasp. Within the kingdom s of consciousness, there is a likeness of energy, and there are many kinds of kingdom s of consciousness. The Family of Light comes from a particula r kingdom of consciousness. When your consciousness learns the laws of creat ion, manipulation, and manage ment of reality, it is quite easy for you to manifest in to any form you choose. For thos e of you who have activated you r shamanistic and native cultural me mories, you well know that part of the teachings of native cultures was how to go into various realit ies and change form. The shamans in certain cultures were revered fo r this. They carried genetic coding, and there were very few on the planet in relation to the entire p opulation.

In times of tumultuous change, when dimensions have the potential to me rge and collide - as you are setting up here for Earth-there is a great gathering of energies that come to participate in the big show. The big show happens on many leve ls, not just in 3-D. A chain reaction moves through all of the dimensions of existence and all of consciousness. Some beings beam th emselves to Earth in disguise as humans, or they incarnate, picking an opportunity to get a ticket into this reality to be here for the event. Perhaps some of those you sense as not native to the planet and not here as sy stems busters are here to observe, to participate, and to understand so that they can take the information back to their own systems, which are always evolving. There are intelligent creatures who are able to manifest as humans an d play the role out to perfection; sometimes their memories are intact, and sometimes th ey have the veil down. It is not always easy fo r these beings to come here with full conscious memory of who they are elsewhere because of the frequency control. You will grow in your awareness over the next few years that you are members of the Family of Light in disguise as humans. Part of the planned evolution of the human species and the p lanned rearrangement of the human DNA is for each person to begin to open a memory bank and remember who they are. In different dimensions of reality, there are, of course, di fferent experiences and di fferent laws. In 3-D, where you have been locked as a human species for so long, ther e is a limitation on what you can experience. The third dimension is designed to focus on one existing real ity at a time. It is designed this way according to frequency and nerve pulsation and th e rate that frequencies adjust the nerve pulsations within the body. You are magnetically and biogenetical ly tuned and designed. The member s of the Family of Light are much more than human. Characteristically, you are s upreme achievers in the multidimensional realm. One applies for a position in the multidimensiona l realm as a member of the Family of Light. As members of the Family of Light , you have incarnated on this plan et to prepare yourselves to do you r work. What is your work? Your work is quite simple: you car ry frequency into syst ems that have limited light frequency, because light is information. This is not cold, co mputer-data information; it is information that is transmitted biologically through an electromagnetic send-out of consciousness. This is what you are experts i n. If you were to have a business card printed up fo r yourselves when you are in full memory of your identity, it would say someth ing like: \"Renegade Member of Family of Light. Systems Buster.

This is an aspect of your identity that you all have in common, and you are here in the millions at th is time. You are here primarily to remember who you are, to operate multidimensionally within the system, and to teach humans-the natives in this place that have been under frequency control for a long time-a new system.

Distri buting knowledge on the planet at this time is based on technology- something outside of yourself . It is another clever bill of goods y ou were sold as a means of control. A long time ago, communication on this planet occurred through contact with one another by the use o f internal mechanisms, not by te chnology outside of yourself. Most humans cannot gras p that their history goes ba ck more than a few thou sand years. You will learn, remember, and teach the planet that it has a histor y of millions of years. First, you will uncover and integrate the history of the planet for the past 300,000 years so that you can expand the picture of the human dilemma. Remember, the hist ory is all inside of you, not outside of you. In your current technology, light-encoded filaments are being created outside of your body in symbolic form as a representation of the transmissi on of intelligence through fiber optics. The human species creates outside of itself what it must learn is inside of itself. It is part of the mastery of light. When the great library of yourselves was put into chaos, there was a littl e bit of data left that kept the species controllable, operable, manageable, and yet functioning on its ow n, performing tasks and stimulating it as a life form and form of consciousne ss to produce a certain frequency: fear. This fear has b een promoted for the past 300,000 years on this planet as a controlled substa nce in every version that you can think of. When a human being resonates elect romagnetically and broadcasts the frequency of fear, a transmission of consciousness is sent out. Where does that fear go? Where do your thoughts go? Where do you r emotions go? We have already said that, collectively, consciousness forms food. As systems busters, you have come in to eradicate the food source, or to change the food source fr om one of fear and chaos. Those who are nourished by that food source will have to either change their diet or leave this planet. You are here to bring information, light, the comprehension that there is potential for change, and a food source that works in cooperation and resonates with li ght.

We understand that some of you are very puzzled about ho w to do this and how to bring about this state of impeccability in your own lives.

But you must act as i f you are newly beamed down, innocent as a babe, and r eady to step forward in to the circumstances o f your daily life. As you awaken each morning and step forward each day, state with clarity what you intend to experience that day. If you are not doing this or cultivating the habit of doing it, then you had best get going! It is the wa y that reality is designed. As we have said before, the big secret that has been kept from the human species is that thought creates experience, and thought creates reality. All reality is created by thought. It is all a subjective experience. But electromagnetically, you ar e being controlled in such a way as to create experiences within a certain spectrum of reality.

They may be p ierced by light and have a reaction, because the more light you bring the faster it will spread. Light is definitely growing on the planet as you remember that you are the na tive species, working closely with the Original Planners, here to take back your world from the raiders. (11) Chapter Eleven A New Paradigm of Light Content of „Bringers of the Dawn“, pg. 117 - 124, Chapter Eleven. In order to survive in the times that are coming, it is imperative to move into the idea of thought manifestation or superconsciousness. Superconsciousness is only a word to you at this time. It is not a concept that is inside of you yet because you cannot c onceive of being so in tune and filled with so much information. Yet, as you evolve, that is what you are moving toward. Ther e are those who are very aware that this movement of c onsciousness could begin to sweep the planet, a nd they are banking on it not occurring. It has already occurred. We have come back into your past to assure you of this. Thought comes first. Experience is always seconda ry. It is never the other way around-that you have the experience and then you base the t hought around it. Always your experience is a direct reflection o f what you are thinking. Clarity and recognition of your own power are the bottom line. Your thoughts form your world all of the time. Not cafeteria style-all of the time. Because you are bombarded wi th so many frequency-control vibrations that attempt to keep you from being clear, you fluctuate. You must, as a species, make it you r intention to stay very clear, to stay centered, and always to bring yourself in to the moment. Stop living in the future or livin g in the p ast, and alwa y s live in y our now. Sa y to y ourself, \"What do I want? I want"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"to accelerate my personal evolution. I want Spirit to assi st me in a greater cap acity. I want my body to regenerate itself. I want to emanat e health. I am willing to give up difficulty so that I can be a living example of what humanitv can be.\" It is this line of thinking-this commanding from your being and calling out what you want with clarity-th at brings you everything in acceleration. Watch your patterns. If you find your self denying that you created a portion of your ex perience, and you don't want to own it as your creation, simply look at it. Say, \"Isn't this interesting-I do this all of the time. I don't want to own what I am creating. If I don' t like it, I blame some one else. Let me see how long I will do this, and let me come up with a solu tion to develop a differen t pattern of behavior.\" Don't judge yourself. Begin to say to yourself, \"I will accept responsibility for al l that I am involved in. I will accept responsibility for everything that happens to me. If I don't like wh at is happening to me, I will begin to ask myself why I create things that I don't like. Maybe it's to get my attention about something so that I can change what is re ally not working for me that I cannot see.\" Always act as if there is an impeccable purpose to everything you do. Act as if your highest good and your highest opportunity involve work ing through every event you are i nvolved in. Always act that way. If you are walking down the street and someone says, \"I've got a gun in your back; let's have you r p urse,\" act as if you are being given an opportunity for your highest growth. You never know what the results are going to be if you be gin to act this way. When you act as if, you act without knowing an d without expectation. This is an attit ude. If you all could have this atti tude and act as if every event is designed to propel you further in your growth and awareness, then you might turn around and find that the person holding the gun in your back is a counterpa rt or portion of yourself . You might be able to heal something; you might be given an oppor tunity to do something you are afraid of. Do not be afraid of what you create. Trust what you create. Trust that there is always something in it fo r you. Do not sweep your dramas under the rug as if they are dirt y old horrible things and you never wish to see them again. Get finished with these dramas: stop cycling in them and being lost in them. However, understand that the drama you have had with your mother, your br other, your sister, you r lover is something you may us e twenty years later to come to a w hole new realization. So let these life dramas be like a file for you. Fi nish them up, resolve them as be st you can, create peace, accept you r p art in them, and then let them cycle back thr ough your consciousness to teach you something. Let them b e ongoing treasures of experience for yourself rather than hackles that you want to get past. Emotion is connected with these things, and remember, emoti on can take you into other realms of activity. Do you believe that you only create your reality in certain areas and that in other areas you are disempowered? Do you argue that you have no control over some ar eas of your life? Do you give up what is naturally yours because society tells you you cannot have it? You will find that events do not come out of the blue. Some of yo u believe that you create your own reality but that others do not create theirs-especially little babies who ha ve all kinds of things happen to th em or children who are abused. It is a difficult concept for many of you to grasp that seemingly helpless children or starving people also create their own reality. Whenever you buy into the victim mentality, you send people the idea that they are powerless and you make that proba bility one for yourselves. You mu st learn to honor other people's dramas and lessons. Realize that th e newspaper is not going to tell you about the potential for change that exists for all of those invol ved in a particular s cenario, because newspape rs do not report and cove r things in that way. You do not understand the underlying synchronicities of ev ents: your media exposes only the external so-called facts and ignores the rich riverbed of emotional significance that accompanies human dramas and lessons. Those who are involved in dramas in which it looks like someone is a vi ctim are usually so out of touch with their feel in g s that the y do not connect how the y feel with what the y are thinkin g . Victims find"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"victims. Victors find victors. So, please, with any newspaper event or world drama in which it looks as if people are hopeless victims, honor them and honor yourself by saluti ng that they created their own reality. It may not be a reality that you need to learn from--or anything you feel a need to participate in. You must understand that others must go through the realms of de nsity to bring them to light. Sometimes the greatest enlightenment lies in the greatest catastrophes and the greatest difficulties. When you go to a restaurant and order something you want, the chef prepares it and the waiters bring it to you. You order it; however, you don' t make it. Somehow the cooks or the spiritual energy make it, yet, you select it to be put before you. It will not be put before you unless you go into the restaurant to order it in the first place. So you ar e responsible for it and you pay for it. Life is the same way; life is like a restaurant. Learn how to order what you want from life like you do in a restaurant and then tr ust that, because you ordered it, it will be put before you. When you go into a restaurant, you don't worry over ever y item and wonder whether or not you deserve to have it. Well, sometimes you do. Sometimes you say, \"Wel l, I don't deserve to have that . That costs fifteen dollars. I can only have something that costs seven dollars or less.\" The way you act in restaurants is a wonderful indication of the way you ac t in life. It is an incredible teaching to understand. When you go into a restaurant, do you simply order and say, \"This is what I want,\" and trust that it is going to come to you, or do you worry that they ar e going to screw it up? As soon as the order is in, do you foll ow the waiter into the kitchen a nd say, \"Oh, they probably won't have the right lettuce. They probably won't saute those onions just so, and they won't have those kind o f mushrooms I want.\" No. You trust it will be presented to you exactly the way you want it and you let it go. When it is presented to you, you say, \"Thank you.\" If it is not quite right, you ask for what is needed and then you proceed. Look at the divine nonchalance you have when you orde r things in a restaurant. That is how you orde r up life. Get clear on what you want, order it and be done with it. D on't keep calling up Spirit to see i f they got the order or give advice on how to fi ll it. You ordered it. Trust that it will come. You are a result of your thoughts. If there is nothing else you learn on th is planet, you will learn that this is the rule in this reality and the rule of many other realities. Thought creates experience. Why not give yourself a gift and begin to think of yourself in a capacity that is exceptional, magnificent, and uplifting; free yourselves from the need to have the rest of society agree with you. Validate yourselves. For some of you, this is very difficult. Ho w do you validate yourself when you are in the habit of not doing it? Your words are either em powering or disempowerin g. We want you to have the courage to live you r light, so we want to emphasize to you and convince you in whatev er way possible that your thoughts formulate your world. Eliminate the words should and trying from your vocabulary. If you were to pay money every time you say these wo rds, you would be in great de bt. You are in a great debt o f disempowerment or impotence. Should implies that you are operating und er someone else's sovereignty. We would like to remind you that you are sovereign unto yourself. If someone is trying to put out a newsletter or trying to change their patterns, th ey can try for the rest o f their life. Trying is not doing. Whenever you use the word trying, you will not accomplish anything b ecause trying is an excuse: \"I tried to do it. I tr ied. I tried.\" In your own life, use the words \"I am creating,\" \"I am doing,\" \"I am manifesting,\" \"I am intending,\" and \"I am bri nging about.\" Forget \"I am trying.\" When y ou become a doer and are able to manifest what y ou want in life, y ou set y ourself u p as a mirro r"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"for many people. There has been a belief that ther e is a limited amount of everything and that only one p erson or the other can be a doer or manifester. When you begin to show that you can bend the laws they want and they can't get it unless you don't have it. If you put yourself behind others and are afraid of having what others do not have because you thin k there is not enough, you do not understa nd that as you allow the divine principles to work in your body and anchor themselves upon the planet that you b ecome a living example of light. You allow the underlying purpose of light to mo ve through your vehicle and you become a living example of what others can do. This is the high vi bration that we intend to teach al l of you. We want you to understand that there is no limitation. There is no limitation on th e entire planet. Each person on the w hole planet can operate in cooperation and in a uniqueness of being. What ever gifts of spirit and materi ality come your way, don't think that you are more lucky than others. Instead, simply unders tand that you are able to get the divine principles to work in your physical body and th at you can show others how. You can say, \"Listen, it works. I have been able to do it. You can do it as well.\" We spend hours teaching people about not being afraid to manifest. Each of you is frightened because you grew up with an ethic that says, \"Only if you work for something is it of any value. If you do not put in hard work, you cannot get things.\" It is imperative for all of you to l ook at this idea of hard work and where it came from. Look at your parents and the belief systems th ey have had. We are talking about birthing a consciousness that represents the ne w human species that learns how to do things effortlessly. If something is not being done effortle ssly, then forget it. If it looks like if is too much work, something is telling you it is not the way. Only when something comes together effortlessly and simply fits, with no one doing too much to it, is it right. If you all begin to live like this, you will completely change how the species of consciousness approaches life. It is not irresponsible or a cop-out-it is a new way o f carrying bricks from one place to another. One time we talked about a big pile of bricks with a group of people and asked them, \"How do you move the bricks?\" They all sai d, \"Well, you pick them up one by one.\" And we said, \"No one eve r thought of hiring someone else to do it?\" If your assignment is moving bricks from here to there, how are you going to do it? Your first answe r may be, \"Well, I will move them . I'll pick them up.\" However, you could go call someone up and say, \"Move these bricks for me .\" If you do that, you are s till doing the assignment. You are doing what needs to be done. Do you think we are going to chastise you if you don't do it yourself ? No. You are still getting the job done. You see the difference? Money seems to be an issue with everyone. You al l have very definitive beliefs about how money comes to you. The more you believe you must work ha rd for money, the harder you are going to have to work. Many of you believe it is quite normal to work hard for money, and that if you don't work hard fo r money then it is \"dirty.\" Let us ask you to remember the word effortless and incorporate it into you r vocabulary. Say to yourself, \"I am e ffortlessly intending that this come about.\" To be effortless is to command to reality to bri ng itself to you in a way that gives room for plenty of energy to be expended in other experimentation. Remember, your reality is a result of your thoughts. If you believe th at things are ha rd, what are you creating? Many of you have spen t lifetimes honoring and respecti ng family members or people o f societ y who y ou believe are u p liftin g citizens and who re p resent to y ou a certain work ethic and value"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"system. You have not thought to ques tion this work ethic or to see if there is any other way. So you b elieve that in order to get m oney you must expend a great amount of energy, or you must be employed b y someone who is going to give it to you, or wh atever. These ideas are completely and totally erroneous. We cannot emphasize th at enough. When you are allowing, Spir it will compensate you in a variety of unexpected ways. The only reason this ha s not happened before is that you just haven't believed it was possible. When you believe things are possible, reality changes. State of mind is the name of the game here. We cannot emphasize that to you enough: how you feel about reality and how you program reality is how you are going to respond to it or how it is going to p resent itself to you. That is why we say, \"Go for it! Be outrageous! Do what excites you! Do the impossible!\" You can do it. You can do whatever you want to do. Y ou will transform your world no matter what state the world is in. Remember, when you learn the rules of the game-that you are a result of thought, and that this is a law within your universe-all you need do is think of how you want to be, and so you shall be. Once you figure this out, you ca n design your body, you can design your ag e, and you can fix everything about yourself, because you will be self-motivated , self-empowered, and self-generated. (12) Chapter Twelve It’s an Awesome Task to Carry Light Content of „Bringers of the Dawn“, pg. 125 - 137, Chapter Twelve. It is time for all of you to redefine your own identities in a much great er sense. Events are transpiring in the cosmos that you and even many of your political leaders have no idea of. You must stop this foolishness about your definitions of godsthinking that there are beings who come from the skies to this p lanet with special talents and abil ities and that they ar e all spiritually conne cted. You are going to discover as a species some very di sturbing ideas over the next number of years. We are preparing you by decree of the Family of Light so that you can understand and be informed about your own options. We have stressed with you this idea of multidimensionality-the concept that you can be in many places and can shift your consciousness. We have shared with you the idea that there will be a number o f worlds created out of this Earth. At one time or another, you will come to doubt everything we have shared with you. Your system will be shocked, and you will not want to believe the extent to which you have been uninformed, so you will deny the va lidity of our information for a time. We can only offer you information based upon your own acceleration. Y ou must evolve yourselves and have your wits about you to ask for information because there is a di vine law concerning interference. There are man y who have broken that law and interfered wi th Earth: even those in our own ancestral"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"realm have done so. We have said to you often enough that this is a free-wil l universe and a free-will zone so that, of course, the underlyi ng theme is that all is allowed. Ther efore, there are always those who wish to be the lords and masters and authorities over others. You ha ve been too simplistic about how many beings control others here. The Family of Light has been noted for its penchant or pred ilection for creating societies in which there is a tremendous movement in all directions along the light rays . What does this mean? Light is information, so the Family of Light is the family of information. There are consciousnesses - families o f war-that spend perhaps billions of years in your conception of time studying, promoting, and experiencing control over consciousne ss. In a universe that exists outsi de of the limitation of time, all scenarios within a free-will zone get played out. This is a time for you to radically change your views about yourselves and to break down boundaries. It is time for you to rise out of the pettiness of day-to-day dramas a nd events and begin to connect on a cosmic level with the higher drama that is occurring. In this way, you can be better in formed about you r own intentions, purposes, and drama. You must be able to understand both your identity and your ability to ride your identity into any world you choose. This story of the Family of Light, or \"The Return of the White T-Shir ts,\" as we like to call it, is who you are. You have committed to do a certain task, to be on assignment, and to reme mber and fulfill what you came here to do. We have told you that your worlds and your identit y within them are going to change drastically, and you are coming clos er to those times. You have ha d changes, many of you. If you loo k b ack to see who you were one year ago, ideally each of you will see that you are now much more empowered. Ideally, each of you is begi nning to feel that you do, in every inst ant, create your own reality, and that every situation you experience, whether you are em ployed or unemployed, is by your own design. At this time, ideally eac h and every one of you has the art of mani festation down, because it is now time fo r you to pull the cosmic gridwork of information into your body and plug it into your psyche so that you can become a broadcaster of this da ta upon the planet. This is the gr idwork that is fired by the light- encoded filaments ou tside of your body. You must become much more discerning about what and who is coming from th e skies, because you are going to be duped and tricked and you are not going to understand it. We see this because we ourselves know how easy it is to dupe and trick you. Sometimes we do it to you to move you along. We told you that we have already been very tricky with you. This wa s necessary, because if we told you the whole story, many of you would have turned tail and run a long time ago. Ideally, we have instilled confidence in you. We have also instilled in you a ne w codicil of information so that you can take the basic building bl ock of this system-the concept that you create yourselves, that y ou create your reality by your thoughts-and formulate a world designed by th e Family of Light. In this way, a plan and new gridwork can overlay a portion of this Earth so that a completely new probability can burst forward. Without you and th e new probability that you are br inging, there is potential for a great cosmic war here upon Earth at some time. Reach out with your feeling center and feel the conf usion that is spreading around this world about what is going on. This planet has operated on a very lo w frequency, a frequency based on survival, and a frequency based on disempowerment. Your identity has been based on what you could gather outside o f yourself.

Feel the fear and uncertainty running through the live s of humans as they begin to realize that the way their lives have been defined is now crumbling. Realize that light is th e culprit of this crumbling and that you, as members of the Family of Light and Keepers of Fr equency, are causing th is crumbling to take p lace because you carry the electromagn etic charge onto the planet th at broadcasts the new frequency. You help create this chao s of new consciousness. Think back over your own lives for the last year or two and realize that there have been times when you, yourselves, have been in an incredible chaos of c onsciousness. You have been in a chaos of decisions about who you are, where you want to live, who you want to mate wit h, whether you want to stay mated or not, whether you want to have a child or not, whether you want to co ntinue to be a parent, and many other things. Reach your minds out into your co mmunities and feel how the founda tion that people have based thei r lives on is slowly slipping away to rubble. The global grasp of reality is going, going, gone. The foundation is sliding away, and there are those w ho cannot see the slide at this time. The most significant reason for this slide is that there is new information accessible that makes the old information archaic and decrepit, and you are responsible for th is. So you are responsible to a certain extent fo r evolving yourselves through this and for being your ow n forms of inspiration-for being living examples for others. You take a very active role. There are many who sa y, \"Oh, no, here comes the light!\" because light is known to alter every vibrational fre quency that it encounter s. Light carries inform ation, and information expands systems so that old systems can no longer exist. So, as li ght moves to destroy, it also births new systems by what it leaves be hind. A new order is formed. Some of you find it difficult to th ink of yourselves as destroyers b ecause you have a belief system about destruction. It is a paradigm, and if you get stuck in that vibration and do not smash t hose ideas, you will b ecome very confined and restricted in experienci ng reality. Yes, you are de finitely destroyers. You destroy systems where the dark team and ignorance prev ail. Light goes in to destroy all systems, and the experience of destruction is relative to how strong or with what fervor consciousness clings to what is being destroyed. Who's going to bail you out wh en the going gets rough? Wh ere is the rescue team? You are it. In orde r to have this transformation take place, you must use what you have to bring it about. There is incredible assistance from all kinds of realms; however, it all depends on you, not us. Y ou are going to change the frequency simply by commitment , determination, and willpower. Discover what you are in your physical body because it is your outreach of power here. Learn to direct and use it and become one with it. By carrying light inside of your body, you bring that frequency onto the planet, and that frequency has information. Th e frequency of light cont ains the history of you r identity and the history of your particular consciousness. As we have said, that consciousness was scattered from your database or cellular structure because those who came in to be your gods could not control you if you had the same abilities they did. So they did the biogene tic experimentation and mutation that has been called \"t he Fall.\" That was when the i gnorance of the human species became more predominant.

There is a need for each of you to examine th e boundaries you have set ar ound yourself. You believe that you have evolved, that you have a large pictur e, and that you see many things. And, relative to where you have journeyed from, indeed you have ma de progress. However, we guarantee you that you are not seeing the boundaries that y ou presently set for yourself, which still define what you believe you can and cannot do. They are what tethers you to this versi on or frequency of reality. These boundaries that you set, and that you adve rtise and announce about yourselves, keep you from moving with the information that is awakening insi de you. The information is part of the spiritual upliftment. Different layers of reality are removed so that you beco me more in tune with the realms o f spirit. That is what spiritual advancement is. We want you to gi ve up boundaries and stop defining and p rotecting every aspect of your lives. It is an awesome task to carry light. Once you allow light to come into your body, you begin the process of change-which is not always jo yous, uplifting, and fun filled, as some of you have discovered. In this p rocess, when things are not so f un filled, the first thing you may do to keep yourself from evolving and changing is to respond to emotional events with fear. You may blame someone else and whine and complain, and you may feel and believe that someone did something to you. The rest of the planet believes this, but they are not members of the Family of Light. There are millions of members of the Family of Light here, of course, and light is retu rning to this planet where the Dark T- Shirts were in charge for a very long time. The Da rk T-Shirts have fed off your emotions of fear an d negativity and war and greed; because this is a free-will universe, a ll of this has be en allowed.

In a short period of time there will be a great need to realize which people are really Keepers o f Frequency and which are just talk ing about it. The Keepers of Fre quency are going to be called upon to create a certain stability upon this planet, for they know 100 percen t of the time that they create thei r reality.

We are here to be your cheerleaders and encourage you to rememb er-to give some guidance and assistance so that you can discover for yourselves the miracl e that awaits inside the human body. The way you can best operate at this time is to be keepers of your own frequency and not go around \"saving\" everyone else.

Each of you assists in making that frequency alive on this planet by living your life accord ing to light and according to wh at you know. This is work of an individual nature.

The continuity we have been speaki ng of-that it will behoove you to brin g into your lives involves knowing from moment to moment inside your beings that you are committed to discovering this exaltation.

I don't use my body for sickness.\" By saving things like this, you bring others to awakening. Speak what you know in casual conversation with family and friends.

Service is not going out and martyring yourself and sayi ng, \"I'm going to save you.\" Service is doing the work yourself and living in such a way that everyone you touc h is affected by your journey. There is nothing wrong with getting a little feisty with Spirit and savi ng, \"Listen guys, I' ve had it. I've b een asking and I'm willing to do it . Please, I want acceler ation.\" If you want an acceleration, be clear, b e very prepared to take off, and be open to r eading the symbols as they come to you. When a book falls off a shelf, read it. When an op portunity comes for you to go somewh ere, don't say, \"I'm sorry- I can't afford it.\" Do it. When a person is put in your path, and yo u have been saving you want a relationship, b ut the person has the wrong packaging, do it. You are operating in no sense, and perhaps these things are Spirit's way of bringing you pattern breakers. If you are clear and you communicate in every situation, you can make a lot of progress. You all think too much about how things are going to come about a nd what the packaging is going to look like. This is important to re alize. So when you ask for an acceler ation, be prepared to take chances that the logical mind may scream about. The logical mind is going to kick and fuss ove r some of these things because it will be afraid. As soon as you hear yourself say \"I can't do that\" or \"That doesn't make any sense,\" listen. These are key words. Simply say, \"I am divi nely guided. I am intending an acceleration. I am intending that I wo rk through an uplifting capacity, and I will take a chance on this. This feels right even though it makes no sense, so I will go for it.\" However, if it doesn't feel good and it doesn't make any sense, then don't do it. Trust your feelings. There is a culling going on-a culling of the chosen. Wh at does it mean to be called \"the chosen?\" Those who gather when we speak and those who hear th e sound of their internal songare the chosen. Just b ecause you are the chosen does not mean you are automatically going to rise in the ranks and perform the duty that needs to be performed. Who chose you? You chose yourselves. You are not members of an exclusive club-and yet, on the othe r hand, you are. The membership in this club is vol untary, and all o f you decided who you woul d be and why you would come he re. We cannot emphasize enough that courage is going to become the middle name for eac h and every one of you. Many of you have lives th at are u1 the closet. You are not willing to let everyone know what you r intimate beliefs are. You may feel very safe in a room discussing a variety of subjects, some of them very far out, vet, in your workplac e or with your family or whatever , you put a zipper across your mouth and hill not give yourself permission to speak your truth. There are a multitude of people whose codings are wa iting to hear your voice. So you, the chosen, are b eing culled at this time. You are being sorted out for courage. If you cannot ga ther courage now, we are not too certain that you are goi ng to gather courage later on. You each came to this planet to do a task, and that task is at hand. It is now. The decade of change is upon you, and as you integrate and realize what this change means, it will alter each and every one o f your lives. The change means giving up many th ings, coming apart from many things, and coming together with other things because you will trust. Trust is the word that all of you would love to have as y our middle name, and y et trust is somethin g y ou all sa y that y ou don't have."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"What does it mean to trust? It means to ha ve such inner knowing th at your thoughts create your world-to simply be quite certain, with divi ne nonchalance and inner knowing, that if you think something, it is. It is this theme over and over again that we are attempting to presen t to you, in every capacity and every means of expression, so th at one of these days you will get it. On ce you get it and begin to live it, you will begin to change your lives. We keep emphasizing that the time to get moving is now. It is not necessarily that you have run out o f time. It is that time is begi nning to squeeze itself in upon you, and if you do not act, things can move into discomfort. As we said, there is a culling of the chosen. You ha ve chosen yourselves; therefore, i f you do not move into the work of the blueprint you ha ve designed for yourselves, to a certain extent you will run out of time. You ha ve a few more years before things will be so topsy-turvy and hectic that i f you are not living your life in the true eminence of li ght you have volunteered to, it could be too late. In other words, if you procrastinate and procrastinate, you will be washed into the undertow of the tidal wave as it comes-perhaps literally. N o matter what the endeavor in whic h you are being led to participate, it is part of your blueprint and p lan so that you can evolve. And by evolving, you affect the evoluti on of the planet. Everything you do is for your evolution. As you come into comprehension of who humans are and what this place is, you b egin to open new pathways for others. You will find that events you never imagined will somehow be p ut together before you. These will be things that are beyond your comp rehension \"setups,\" as we like to call them, or opportuniti es you never thought of. This is when you will know that you are living you r light and doing so with courage. There is a good possibility that light carriers will come into question in the next few years. Understand that this is part of the plan. Al l of you must have a clea r intention as to how you would like your reality to be designed. This does not mean that you are not flexible; it means that you operate with clarity. You say, \"To my guides and all of those who are assisting me in my evolutionary jour ney on Earth: It is my intention that I be successful. It is my intention that I be always safe in all things that I do. It is my intention that I receive love and gi ve love in all things that I do. It is my intention that I have a good time and that I be provided for with prosperity according to my need s. It is my intention that I not become overly enamored of the material world.\" Though you must do your own work to evolve, there are many off-pl anetary and nonphysical beings ready to work with you. All you n eed do is call them for assistance. When you do, always state clearly that any assistance come to you from light. Stay in your integrity and be aware. On this planet, it is assumed that if someone is intell igent they are spiritually aware. This is absolutely a falsehood! Someone can be brilliant and learn to transcend human laws and yet st ill not operate wi th the frequency of light or the frequency of love. Be aware of this and be clear about the assist ance you call to yourself. We have mentioned many times that light frequency brings informati on. Love frequency brings creation as well as respect for and connection to all of cr eation. Love frequency wit hout light frequency can be very crippling. If you think that love frequency comes from someth ing outside of yourself instead o f from inside yourself, you will do what has been done on this plan et over and over again: worship someone who is promoting love frequency as if they were a saint. The ideal is to carry the light fre quency of information-to become informed-and to couple it with love frequency. This will allow you to feel a part of creation and to not j udge it or be frightened by it but simply to see the divinity and perf ection of it as it e volves to teach every included consciousness about itself."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" (13) Chapter Thirteen Whose Purpose Are You ? Content of „Bringers of the Dawn“, pg. 139 - 148, Chapter Thirteen. We said that you exist for a purpose. Whose purpose? Did you ever think of that one? Whose purpose are you? You have purpose because all aspects of consciousness are connected to one another. None exist outside the system; they are all parts of th e whole. That is the purpose we wa nt you to seek. The essence of the vehicle you occupy and the energy you generate are part of a developmental se quence that you can say has a purpose for your personal se arch in life. But what purpose do you add to the whole? Can you conceive of someone el se using your purpose and growing fro m it? An energy that you do not know exists? This universe is interlocked in such a way that it is based on the domino system. All aspects o f consciousness have gathered in th is universe to affect each othe r because that is the only way consciousness in this partic ular system can experience itself. In another system or another universal structure, each and every type of consciousness may be completely fr ee. In other words, you could be on your own and serve no purpose to anyone else. That is not true in this universe. There are many different universes and themes. Just like one hundred pennies make a dollar, certain collections of universes make something that is a collection of energies. Ev entually, you will begin to fathom and recognize that there are whole systems of existence that ha ve nothing to do with existence as you are working with it. This syst em is designed as a free-will zone, within which everything is interlocking and interworking with everything else. There are other kinds of zones, which perhaps you could also call free-will zones, where everything is independent of everything else. Here on Earth, everything is interlocke d with everything else. There is much more space in a system in which everything is independent. Or, let us say, there is much more awareness of space, not necessarily space. That kind of universe could in actuality be much smaller than this universe, but because it is not operating out of density, the awareness of space could be greater. Your purpose is to carry informati on and, by carrying it, to make the information accessibl e to others by frequency. When we share a story with you, you end up carrying information. Info rmation is light; light is information. The more you become informed, the more you alter your frequency. You are electromagnetic creatures, and ever ything that you are, you broadcast to everyone else. Just as you can recognize someone in fear, you can r ecognize someone in joy if you be gin to learn how to use your body to tune into this kind of reco g nition."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Your assignment is to carry inform ation and to evolve yourself to the highest capability within the human form. When you do this, you ca nnot help but affect multitudes. You may feel that your particula r occupation is not on a grand scale-say, for instance, you are a waitress. Rememb er, things are not what they appear to be on the outside, and everyone you come in contact wi th is affected by your vibration. Some of you may be left in very menial or mundane jobs for a while, or you ma y be led simply to be p arents and guardians of your chil dren, or you may do work that you f eel is not exactly on the road to high glory. Yet you will have a certain time period in which you must assimilate all of this information that is indeed radical. You must fit it into your life, and you must fi t it into the history of your world by living it, perceiving it, and getting used to it. Once you can consistently maintain a frequency o f information and not be riding the roller coaster of emotions up an d down because you don't know who you are, you will be given a task. It will be put before you, and it will be part of your blueprint. You r blueprint is your own personal detailed plan or outline of action for this lifetime. Many of you already know your blueprint and what you will be guided to. E ach of you knows your plan in the deepest portion of your being. What gets in the way of your knowing is logically thinking that you don't have the talent for your plan or that you can't do it. If you go into a meditative state, you will receive a picture of your identity and reality and the next step of your assignment day by day. Meditation is a state of communicati on; it is not a way to go somewher e to get lost. Me ditation is a way to get informed and to go to a place that nourishes you. You will move into your pur pose and, more than likely, it will have to do with facili tating the frequency: transducing it, stepping it down to others, explaining it, using it to heal others, and stabilizing it for the human race. When each of you can hold a frequency of information without freaking out and can be counted upon to be consistent, th en you anchor the frequency on the planet. That frequency is recognized. It cannot be traced, ex actly, but it can be recognized, and it is being recognized now. That is why there has been a frenzied step -up to alter that frequency. You will see more frequency control everywhere you look, only now you will be ab le to recognize it for what it is. You will find that all th e things in your life have prepared yo u step by step for wh at you will be doing. At one time, perhaps, you were a Boy Scout leader and learned how to work with young boys. Maybe at another time you worked in a restaurant and learne d how to work with food and to serve. Through you r j obs, you created certain aspects of re ality so that later on, when you mu st teach these systems how to go beyond themselves, you have an idea where these humans are coming from. We speak to you as if you are not human because, to us, you are not. To us , you are members of the Family of Light, and we know your multidimensi onal selves. We speak to you about dealing with humans because it is your assignment to integrate with them , soothe them, and aw aken a spark of light within them so that they are not all destroyed and so that this pl ace can house a new species and a new realm of activity. We have talked many times about the evolving DNA and the frequenc y modulation that has kept the species and the experiment controllable and mana geable.

If it were easy for you, how could you possibly unders tand how difficult it is for others? Humans have been controlled by frequency for a long ti me. They are so used to this frequency control and the logical mind has been so overly developed in recent times th at there is much suspicion and fear- a dark place of self that is so cont rolled that people are frightened to even go into it a nd trust that they could possibly receive information on their own. When you think of the entities who have modulated the way humans broadcast themselves by rearranging their DN A and instituting va rious scenarios and events upon this planet-and then funneling the results of this psychic energy through different portals out into space for their own reasons- you can see what you are battling. There are those who want you and the whole planet to function in no other way but through logic-a very fearful logic. The best advice we can offer you at this time is toy use that logic. Say, \"I wi ll be in logic here for a moment and see what my logical mind is doing. It is wanting to take ove r. It has been told that this is how it is. I have also been told that this ot her stuff is true too. I will simply observe how I waive r b etween one and the other. Am I angry? Am I insecure? What bri ngs me upliftment? What brings me security? What does each mode of thinking do for me? What am I pe rceiving about myself? How am I feeling?\" Observe and acknowledge all of this. Then say, \"Now that I've give n everyone a chance to be on stage, what do 1 want?\" Reaffirm what you want, and you know you want to evolve. Do you see how cycling b ack through doubt is in actuality part of the Divine Plan? It is part of unde rstanding what others who will be following in your footst eps will go through. You must learn to open your compassion center o r heart center, which is probably one of the most difficult things to do. Learn to feel compassion fo r yourself and for everyone else, as you all have the courage to let go and feel. It is very important to observe how you deal with ev ents. Different events are brought to you so that you can observe them. Learn to observe your behavior and to spend much more time alone even i f sometimes it is difficul t for you and you feel lonely. In the l ong run, you will thank us for directing you to have a more meaningful encount er with yourself. You hold the ri chness and ripeness that can bring you into higher realization. There is an order that you operate within that part of yourself ca nnot see. Sometimes when part o f yourself is operating without visi on or seeing, events occur to get you back on track. Be aware that, in this new chaos of consciousness and confusion and sh ifting of uncertainty, ther e is a divine order. This could be compared to baking a cake. Each ingredient in the recipe is of itse lf an integral whole and has its own sense of struct ure: the eggs, the flour, th e butter, the sugar. When you begin to put them all together, it looks as if you are making chaos. Someone could say, \"You are wrecking everything. You wrecked that egg. Where did the s ugar go? You are wrecking all of th e essential elements here.\" They don't understand, perhaps, the magic of the catalytic formula of heat. There is a catalytic energy present at this time on the planet as all of the individual structures begin to melt and merge to create what looks like chaos. There will be somethi ng new born out of this, just like a cake is born out of the chaos of mixing together certain ingredients. Some one who does not understand that after you mix cake batter, you put it in the oven to bake it, c ould look at the goopy batter and thin k they made nothing.

You enter an altered state, particularly when you go to a sacred site on Earth. You move into a different dimensional frequency and everything changes. You feel uplifte d and full of energy, or sick to your stomach. Something goes on when you move into an altered state. Since you are in the altered state, you do not always know you are in it. That is the beginning of the dimensional merge. When you return home from a sa cred site, you may look back and say, \"Wow, what happened there?\" That is the feeling of experiencing different dimensions. Dimensional collisions are another story. Those who are gripped wi th fear and refuse to change, even though their purpose is to be on the planet at this time to cha nge, will experience the dimensions as collisions.

There are those who exist in this universe who have yet to disc over human emotion. When you visit Earth's ancient lands and look at th e creations of other times and plac es, you can feel the frequencies and vibrations inherent in the sites. You know that there are keys there, and you know that there are messages that there is something locked within that once existe d and will surface again. In the same way, human beings have something hidden within them that is very valuable for the evolution of the universe. We refer to this data as the codes and master numbers : geometric formulae of li ght that are integral to recreating and producing life fo rms throughout this universe. Human beings have been tucked aw ay, hidden, and forgotten in the an tiquities of time ever since thei r DNA was rearranged, because it is in the distant past of the chronicles of t ime when the species was alive and vibrating very di fferently. That time has been forgotten or shelved by some.

There are those, however, who have not forgotten.

Wh at is in Earth is like a locked-away secret in the chronicles of time, a nd it has to do with emotion. In this gift of emotion th ere is wealth and richness; there is incredible ab ility to transcend many different realities and to move through and experience many different states of awareness. Emotio n allows certain energies to coalesce, fuse, bond, and come together in reali zation of themselves. Without emotion, that bond could not be. There are those existing in this universe who are very ancient and who have come to the realization o f what this place is. They have been working for eons .

They steer this unive rse on its course; that is their job. Just like you have jobs, their job is to st eer this universe on a course of discovery. They have discovered from their own learni ng and journey that they must connect with other universes. There is a plan to catapult and send energy into new experience. At this time, Earth and a number o f other systems where you simultaneously exist are inst rumental in the reemerge nce of emotion, with the p urpose of comprehending all identities compacted into one.

This is new territory. Emotion is the key to all of this. As human beings, you need em otion to connect you with your spiritual self. Emotion is essential to unde rstanding spirituality because emotion generates feeling. The mental b ody and physical body are very linked, as are the em otional body and spirit ual body.

If you wish to have an acceler ation, dive into something that b rings up feeling. Stop skirting the i ssue so that you can think you are in control. Dive in the middle of it and then see if y ou are in control. It's not that you don't know how to feel, it's that you are afraid of your feelings. You don't know what to do with them when you have them. They bring up a sense of powerlessness within you, so you associate feeling with a sense of, \"Oh, no, I blew it.\" You have a boundary in your belief system that states that when something comes up that is emot ional and brings pain or anger, then it is not good. It is time to stop tiptoeing around things and avoiding your emotions. Anger serves a purpose. All of you wa nt to get finished with it: you wa nt to sweep it under the rug and act as if it is no good. You act like it is rotten vegetables, throw it out, and bury it in the back garden as if there is no purpose to it. We are emphasizing that there is a purpose to fear and a purpose to anger. I f you would allow yourselves to expres s and experience your fears, whic h might lead to the expression o f your anger, you would learn something. Those of you who want desper ately to avoid fear and anger, and who are really afraid of these feelings, have some thing great to learn through these emotions. They are techniques that move you beyond your personal boundaries of identity and behavior, and you are simply afraid to experience this. Most of the time, all you want is to be accepted. You feel that no one will like you if you do certain things or feel certain ways, so you don't give yourself perm ission to have those cer tain feelings. That is where the anger comes from. You have anger because you make j udgments about what you can and cannot do. If you do not give yourself permission to feel, you cannot learn. Feeling connects you with life. Feelings serve a variety of purposes in human beings. We enc ourage all of you to please trust and cultivate and rely on your feelings. Understand th at your feelings are your ticket to ride into multidimensional realit ies, where you must go if you are seriously playing this game. In multidimensional realities, you learn to hold and focus many diff erent versions of yourself at once. Feelings can take you to these pl aces, particularly feelings th at you trust. Many of you are very suspicious and masterful over your feelings. You will not allow certain feelings to come forward, or you j udge them when they come up instead of observin g where they take you or what they do for you. Because you have a fear of something, you keep your self from experiencing it because you put up a wall that says, \"If I go there, it is bad.\" You put the brakes on. In actuality, your fear will ev entually energize the experience into your realm of development because all thought is drawn into form based on the emotional influence behind it. So so metimes the greatest thing to do is to simply say, \"What the heck, I will go there. I surrender.\" Then deal with being there and don't wo rry about being centered while you are in your feeling center. If you intend to go into your feeling center and always be in control, you are not giving yourself the range of movement that is needed to ride the emotions that knock down boundaries and belief systems. Anger has its purpose. A nger is not purposeless a nd pain is not purposeless. They all lead you to something. You can make an intenti on to go into your feeling center and learn how to be centered there while you explore the opportunities. If you say, \"I am going to be cen tered there,\" it sounds as if you won't allow yourself any movement within it. Instea d, just intend to have a centeredness. A centeredness does not mean that things don't fluctuate; it means that you allow things to fluctuate. Whether a boat is ready to tip over or is in calm water, you allow it. You ride it, then you get out of the event either a calm ride or a rou g h ride. Your emotions are not j ust food for others, the y are f ood f or the sel f . This is how"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"you nourish yourself and create your identity. This is your identity as frequency through your emotions. Emotions feed you and feed your call letters into existence. You are going to deal with each of your boundaries, simply because th at is what you do not want to do. You would love to say, \"Golden star dust, eliminate all that has limited me. Boom! I am free!\" Ideally, it would be so simple. That is a cla ssic example of wanting to recircu it and bypass the feeling center. You have certain emotional beli efs or feelings th at assist in making these b oundaries outside of yourself, so when you break a boundary, you have to deal with the emotion that put the bounda ry there in the first p lace. Through your emotional body you are connected to your spiritual body. You may want to bypass something that is difficult, yet you have to feel your way through it. You want to sweep difficult things under the rug and say, \"I don't want to do th ese,\" when the difficult things are your gemstones. Even if you discove r you have 101,000 boundaries, do not feel frustrated. Simply say, \"This is interesti ng.\" Look at the boundaries you have set up and, in stead of swearing at them, simply observe them and see if you can discover how they came about. See what purpose they served-what grocery store you shopped in when you bought those items. As soon as you acknowledge and recognize and are wi lling to release something, it moves. When you cling or have fear or think, \"I like that boundary; that serves me very well,\" then you limit yourself. You must learn to love your emotions. As long as you describe somethi ng as difficult, you are making it difficult. No one else is. You are resisting and judging the change s coming about. You are feeling that you do not know what is going on, and you wish to be in control. Contro l is something very convenient and very handy. It must be a pplied at the right place at the right time, like supe r glue. Super glue in the wrong place doesn't do much good. Did you ever super glue your hands or lips together? You must learn to exercise control in the way you use super glue. If you screw up with super glue, you get stuck and you can't do anything. Control is the same way: you get stuc k with it, and it sticks you to something that you don't need to be stuck to. You must be very selective about what you decide to control or not control. The old human pattern, or the paradigm that exists, says, \"You must be in control.\" You, as members of the Family of Light, are having an awakening. You need your emotions. You must b ecome friends with your emoti ons because, through feelings, you can climb the ladder to the multidimensional self and the twel ve-chakra system and explore wh at you discover. Through feelings, you can tell if something is going on or not. The logical mind will di sinvolve itself when something is going on if the body is not plugged into feeling. Feel ing registers frequency change. Logical mind does not register frequency change. You are experiencing an awakening of frequency change. You are bei ng led to change many portions o f your life and to give up many things . Don't resist the cha nges and feel out of c ontrol because you don't know what is coming and it appears that your emoti ons are getting in your way. Your emotions are simply wanting to show you somethi ng; you don't like it because you th ink your emotions are interfering or will embarrass you. Get clever. Next time you come in to one of these emotional situat ions, say to yourself immediately, \"Alright, I know what is going on; I'm not getting ca ught in this one. I know there is something here fo r me to learn, and something for me to change. I believe that I am guided and th at I am following a b lueprint, so I will check out what is in this for me by not judging it a nd by going with the flow. I request that all my changes come in joy and safe ty and harmony. That is my decree. Everything in my evolution I am inte nding is covered by that: I experience joy and safety and harmony.

It is imperative fo r p eople to trust the feeling center and operate with it. When \"stuff \" activates your feeling center and b rings you into discomfort, face the feelings that you do not like. This is your essence. These feelings are your jewels, your treasures, and your gems, from which you can learn about your identity. They are your springboard, and you are never fi nished with them. You cannot s hove them away and say, \"Yuck, I don't like the me I was then!\" However, you can alte r the \"you\" who perceived reality in that way. As you continue to become aware and gain a vast comp rehension of who you are, you can look back at that entity in that place and have a whole new realization of who you we re then. This process is ongoing. You will begin to see it in one another. Honor your friends as they go through their \"stuff\"; just don't get involved in it. If it is for you, do it, but don't help others prol ong their dramas. It is time to move through \"stuff,\" not to stage a 365-day Broadway run with it. We suggest telling your stories once or twice or three time s, and that is it. You don't need to tell everyone everything, because ever yone else has their \"stu ff\" occurring too. Do you understand? When you continually sp eak about your \"stuff ,\" you are missing the point because you are talking instead of doing and seeing what you are telling yourself. By ta lking to everyone about what is going on with you, you are simply wanting to ge t attention, and you don't need to do that. Events are ongoing, and you never real ly finish with them because they are your \"stuff.\" If something is p ainful for you at the time, we guarant ee that later you will encounter a situation that is similar, and you will have gained a compassion that you never had before. You will see the situation all in a different p erspective. What is coming up now are the things that originally blocked you from perceiving reality. These are the p arts of your emotional body in which the highway system was severed and the information could not flow, so you moved into pain and translated the emotional pain out of your physical body. We recommend to all of you that you receive bodywork. Bodywork simply involves bringing energy from outside the cosmos into your body, infusing it with your other bodies-m ental, physical, emotional, and spiritual - and making the energy grid fit. Where the energy grid fits a nd you don't block cellula r memory and you allow - energy to step into your body, the energy moves th rough your chakras and feeds your body its data. Wh en you are afraid or you shut down, or when y ou blame someone else, o r when you are in denial, you get stuck. Then, even though light floods unto your body, it does not fit with the gridwork. So you are in chaos, and everybody else wants to stay aw ay from you because you emanate chaos. Chaos is a fine place to be; th ere is nothing wrong with ch aos as long as you don't p ermanently dwell there. When you deny emotion, y ou are asking for major Earth changes to take place within your psyche. When you allow a tornado here, a hurricane there, or a small volcanic eruption here and there, you are allowing your emotions freedom of expression, and they will not run rampant over your personal environment. Feeling is what connects you to your humanity; f eeling is what connects you to your emotions. Emotions connect you in this realm of existence to your spiritual body. What we are saying is that emotions, or feelings, are the key to being alive in this reality. Many realities exist without emotions, but in this reality they are your greate st gift. If you deny your emotional self in this lifetime, then you had b est realize that you have hung it up. If you are not going to be part of your em otional self, then you are never going to make the game we are talking about.

This beautiful Earth is a treasure so profound and so magnanimous that it draw s those from far in space to come cherish the beauty that is here. We want you to feel that beauty inside yourselves and let it p ulsate within your own beings. As you allow this beau ty to come into yo u, it will move you p rofoundly, and you will begin as a species to command that the beautification of Earth become the first p riority for all. We want to seed this idea into you so that you awak en to your respons ibility to Earth. We have awakened within you the responsibility to yourselves, and you are on the road to becoming the b est that you can be; we congrat ulate you. Now, what ar e you going to do for Earth, and how are you going to do it? We have taught you to command the best for yourse lf in all possible mome nts. Since Earth is you r home, how are you now going to extend this energy to Earth and affect this planet with what you know? How many of you have walked your own property, consider ing it a sacred space, and let Earth know how much you treasure it? That so rt of communication will get you i nvolved with the beautiful Earth. I nvolve yourselves in doing. Look at your garbage, at what you ar e throwing away, and at what you are unconscious of. It is an exact re flection of what we have asked you to do with yourselves. Look at you r thoughts and at the garbage that clutters your psyche . All we have taught you, you can extend to Earth. Wherever you go, communica te with Earth and let the planet know you are aw akening. You must thin k of yourself as a thread of light; wherever you walk, drive, fly, or visit, you are carrying your thread o f light. As more and more threads ar e woven around the planet, eventually there will be a fantastic cosmic wave of light. We are in a world that is on the brink of slowing down before it goe s into a mad frenzy. You can begin that slowdown by consciously taki ng greater care of Earth. The pre dominant consciousness on Earth at this time, particularly in the Un ited States, maintains that having the best-looking lawn is a status symbol. In order to have that be st-looking lawn, you use as many pesticides and ch emical fertilizers as p ossible until the lawn begins to look like a carpe t that would be in your living room. Where did that value system come from, and what is the sense in it? The sense in that value system is that someone made money off a product and creat ed a marketing campaign that ga ve that product legitimacy, and someone bou g ht it."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Communicate with Earth, listen to it, and let this beautiful planet teach you how to live in harmony. This is a slow process, and you are not going to learn it overnight. He ar Earth saying, \"L isten, would you like someone pouring pesticides on your sk in?\" This is what happens wh en you pour them on Earth. Earth is a sentient being, or collection of be ings. The sentient beings that make up Earth came into this collective of consciousness out of love for the unity of this consciousness and desire to experience being a home for consciousness. This is like you being the home for all the bacteria and all the things that live on you r skin and inside your body. You work with them. Earth understands that , in order to be a good mother to its children, it must let the children learn their own lessons. Your less ons are, of course, the lessons o f responsibility. If you want something, there are cer tain ramifications and things you must do and responsibilities you must take on to accomplish your goal. Earth is teach ing human beings responsibility by allowing you to create disruption upon its surface and into its interior. When Earth is in jeopardy and humanity has pushed th ings too far, Earth will do whatever is necessary to teach the human species about the proper care of its home, in order fo r you as the inha bitants to learn a bigger lesson. In divine love of humanity and divine acceptance of its role as teacher, Earth will teach you about its own secrets and power so that you can understand how to walk with cooperation and love of Earth and not walk with disrespect. This inevitably leads to the overw helming probability of Earth doing some major changes in order to capture the consciousness of human beings and poi nt out to them what they are missing. If twenty million people disappeared in an afternoon because of an Earth change, perh aps the other humans would wake up. Perhaps. You have heard the predictions of Earth changes over and over ag ain. Some of you have taken them with a grain of salt. You have not thought they would happen to you, though you might think they would happen to someone else or in the newspaper ha lfway around the world. What about when a change happens at your doorstep or in the next city over? What about when the major cities in the United States b egin to collapse? How do you think you will feel if you awake someda y and find that there has been a tear in the Earth from New York City to Washington, D.C.? Would that be enough to shake you up a little bit? Enough to restru cture and revalue your lives? You are becoming more aware of what is going on b ecause now your newspapers are beginning to carry the stories. The stories ha ve actually been there for some time. There have been environmentalists and conservationists talking about envi ronmental changes for twenty year s, but people figured that the p roblems would fix themselves. Besi des, environmental issues do not sell newspapers, and, to a certain extent, people have not been intere sted in learning about responsibi lity. That attit ude is going to b ackfire; most people will claim ignorance and thi nk the issues came out of nowhere. Things are going to get so severe that we predict there will be countries that will ban the use of the automobile. Earth's teachings or lessons at th is time have to do with many things. As frequenc ies change, everything changes. When frequencies change, it is like m oving from your house: the w hole environment changes. These changes are designed to uplif t everyone's life. They are designe d to bring everyone to a greate r p lace of ease and comprehension. They are designed to disengage human beings from the paradigm that has defined your world as solid and in very limited terms. When human beings make quality of life the number one priority in their lives by honoring the quality of Earth's life, there will be very few Eart h changes upon this planet. However, most humans, p articularly in the Western world, are concerned with a very different qualit y of life: how many electronic devices they own, how many clothes are in their closet s, and how many cars are in thei r garages. They are not at a ll connected to the effects of all of th is material manufacturing on the sentient b ein g that is y our p arent."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"If human beings do not cha nge-if they do not make the shift in valu es and realize that without Earth they could not be here-then Earth, in its love for its own initiation a nd its reaching for a higher frequency, will bring about a cleansing that will balance it once again. There is the potential for many people to leave the planet in an afternoon. Maybe then everyone else will begi n to wake up to what is going on. There have been events all along stimulating you, encouraging you, a nd bringing you to the realization that there must be global cha nge. There are grass-roots move ments that are going to grow p henomenally. What happens to Earth depends on how willing everyone is to change. What is your responsibility in this? How willing are you to change? The time has co me not to just tal k about it but to do it. As you commit to change in your own life, you automatically make the change available to the entire planet. Earth is striving fo r its integrity. The planet feel s at this time deprived of its integrity, dishonored, and unloved. Earth loves you and gi ves you a place to operate; it is a living organism. Earth is about to reestablish its integrity and let you understand the importance of loving yourse lf by loving Earth. Love yourself and love Earth, because they are the same. Earth changes could play an important role in br eaking down the system. They will bring about the collapse of the insurance companies, which will bring about the coll apse of many other systems. Many of the banking businesses sell their mortgages to the insura nce companies, and the insurance companies invested very heavily in the junk- b ond industry. Given a few more majo r disasters like Hurricane Hugo or the San Francisco earthquake coupled with war and the underground econom y-how long do you thin k they can continue to operate? On pa per, no one has quite caught up with this yet. It is still a matter o f checks shuffling from one bank to another and keepi ng everything just above wa ter. So Earth changes, more than likely, will be utilized in some way to bring about that co llapse. Earth changes will also bring about a joining and triumph of the human spirit because men and wome n will go out to help other men and women when disasters occur. This bonds people. There are technologies that could cl ean this place up very quickly if th at were the plan. However, as the species at present does not take re sponsibility for Earth, th ere would be no point. The present species must learn to honor its nest. All of you must learn to honor your bodies because without your bodies you would not be here, and without Earth you would not be here. Your body and your planet are your two greatest gifts and the most valu able things you own. Ideally, you w ould express a sacredness and honoring and cherishing and love of Earth and your physical being. Th is would resonate in your home, your property, the land you are associated with, and the land of your body as well. Earth is more resilient than you w ould imagine. It is here to feed you and sustain you. The animals are also here to work in cooperation wi th you. If everything is done with l ove, it has the force of the Creato r b ehind it. Done with love, there would be no hurt and no harm. If you need a guide to make decisions about your behavior, ask yourself: \"Am I operating with rny highest integrity? Am I operating with love? Is love my intention for Earth, the animals, all the people I encounter, and all the things I do? Everything of Earth can be used if Earth is loved and honored in the process. It may be difficult to imagine a gang of oil workers, before they se t the bit into the ground, holding hands and asking fo r guidance and permission to penetrat e Earth. Yet, if this were done, things would be much more in harmony. You laugh becaus e you deem it foolishness to communi cate to something that does not tal k b ack. But if industry, educ ators, and all people first stopped and co mmitted to the highest integrity and love for all involved and asked that there be no ha rm to Earth or humans, it would be phenomenally received. This would put into motion the plan fo r a high civilization.

They say, \"I will just keep my job and my security; what the heck.\" One o f the most incredible things that can happen in any so ciety occurs when everyone's security is taken away. Courage begins to blossom like a freshly planted garden because people have nothing to lose. Humans begin to stand up. N ever feel that your efforts are in vain. Use the power of your mi nd to clearly intend what you want. Ask for assistance from the nonphysic al realms and visualize the out come you would like to have.

When you approach anyt hing, approach it from the bigge r p icture. When enough people create their own reality-consciously create it-you will create a new planet. There will literally be a splitting of worl ds. This splitting will more than li kely not occur for more than twenty years. In the meantime, Ea rth will more than likely be ravaged by war quite a few t imes. You will have some very puzzling and confusing space dramas take place with some space cousins who need to figure out quite publicly who they are. Earth is on a dimensional collisio n course, and many dimensions or probabilities will intersect one another my this decade. Some of these realities will be shoc king, depending upon the level of shoc k each person needs to kick their co nsciousness into another paradigm . Shock does not mean destruction, necessarily. It can simply be a method to alter the way you view reality. Whenever you are shocked by something, you can no longer grip r eality the way you gripped it th e moment before. There is an instantaneous kick in the stomach, and everything ch anges. The world is in for numerous shocks, and not simply on a national level. We are talking about global inters ections of dimensions by which realities will seem to come tumbling down only for those whose realities need to crumble. The concept of probabilities mainta ins that there is no one reality and that you, yourselves, branch of f into other realities continuously th rough your thoughts. It is not that you change the world, it is that you change which world you occupy. This goes back to the id ea that the world is not solid. It is constructed of energy, and that energy takes form through the thought s of those that particip ate within the world. There are, and there always have been, probable Earths and probabl e experiences. There are probable \"you's\" leading quite different lives than the you you know. You are frequenc y and energy. You are p ulsating to the beat of a chord of energy that sings you into existence, and you are so familiar with it that you stay focused continuously on one aspect of your experience. Experience is gained from many p erspectives, and you are lear ning how to change the frequency and beat so th at you can notice what you usually do not notice. You are continuously monitored as to the effect of the ne urological changes that are taking place in you r bodies. The rewiring or restructuring is like your ne rvous system going from a two-lane highway system to a twelve-lane highway system. When this takes place, you will have me mories of events that have run simultaneously with other events. At first, this may freak you out a little bit because you will have no p lace to plug them in. For example, say two years down the road you remember a Thanksgiving dinner you had in 1989 o r 1990. Then suddenly, you have a memory of an event you never before re membered, and it is right next to and parallel to the Thanksgiving dinner you did remember. You then realiz e that you were at two Thanksgivings. This is what will happen as the nervous system co mes into a new pulsation and the body has its librar y p ut back to g ether. As the li g ht-encoded filaments reform th emselves and broadcast what"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"they have available, the nervous system must be able to car ry and translate it. There is a great polarization of energies occurring, with many participants a nd observers. Many who have come to observe have come to disrupt as well; they have come to learn their \"stuff \" in this time. There are also participants who are completely intent on creating a worl d that will be quite glorious. As we see it, as the probable worlds begin to form, there will be grea t shiftings within humanity on this p lanet. It will seem that great ch aos and turmoil are forming, that na tions are rising against each other in war, and that earthquakes are happeni ng more frequently. It will seem as if everything is falling apart and cannot be put back to gether. Just as you sometimes have ru mblings and quakings in your lives as you change your old patterns and move into new en ergies, Earth is shaking itself free, and a certain realignment or adjustment period is to be expected. It will also seem that the animals and fish are departing Earth. Those animals are now moving over to the new world as it is being formed. They are not ending their existence, they are merely slippi ng into the new world to await your joining them. It is difficult to explain this , to a certain extent, because it is beyond the third-dimensional experience. Basically, you are moving into the f ourth dimension. When this move is made, you will literally form a new Earth. It will se em as if you have awoken from a dream into a world that is pristine and beautiful. Your sk ies are full of observers watching and waiting to see how you will do this and offering to give you assistance in doing it. For many people, it seems as if this shift is co mpletely beyond all possibility. Bu t not for you who have studied this energy as alchemists and ancient Atlanteans in temple li fe. The training you have had in other times is encoded within your bein gs to prepare you for this juncture. The people who leave the planet dur ing the time of Earth changes do not fit here any longer, and they are stopping the harmony of Earth. Wh en the time comes that perhaps twenty million people leave the p lanet at one time, there will be a tremendous shift in consciousness for those who are remaining. When a large group passes over together, they create an impact upon the consciousness of those who remain. Expand yourselves. Begin to dwell in other realities besides the reality that is wo rk and sleep and eating. When you are awake, let your mind expand to possib ilities and let ideas co me to you. Ideas are free; they are everywhere, and there are broad casts continuously coming to the planet. When Earth does its shifting, not everyone will experience the same thing. Those who need to experience destruction will experience an Earth shift or rotation w ith destruction because they will not fit with the new frequency. Those who are prepared to hold a higher vibrat ion will experience a frequency shift. So for one person there may be the end of their life as they know it and dire destruction, while for another there will be a st ate of ecstasy. All potentials exis t. Remember, you live in a symbolic world that is a result of your t houghts. The outside world represents to you what is going on internally with you. So if the world is falling apart, what does that represent? It represents the falling apart o r collapsing of what is inside in order to create the rise of a new system and a new energy. It is imperative for you to love and bless the changes within societv an d not move into fear or anxietv about what is presenting itself. It is your task to be in the vibrati on of knowing, even without sense, that in every event there is an opportuni ty for Spirit to do its work and to uplift. You are an exceptionally lazy species.

In order to turn you toward yourselves, you need some events to put you in charge of your lives. Bless th ese changes that come to Earth and, in these events, trust that what you want with clarity will be ma nifest. You will find yoursel f tested. You will say, \"Am I a vict im here?

Or is it uplifting itsel f around me while ever y thin g is seemin g l y in the midst of colla p se?\""},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"An important primary belief for you to hold is that you will be in the right place at the right time doing the right thing.

I shall take this.\" Believe it or not, ther e will come a time or let us say, there could come a time-in many of your lives when you will shut the door on life as you now know it. Literally, you may give up the house that you have and walk out of it with onl y a few possessions. It does not seem possible now , does it? Something inside of you will say, \"My God, has the world gone mad? What are my values?

We are not talking about the evolut ion of a few dozen peopl e; we are talking about the evolution of the species. There will need to be some events to bring people to awaken ing. That is why it is going to be your challenge to live your life with courage and to have the courage to live your light. We recommend that all of you in tend that the Native American teachings come your way. Begin to explore them through sweatlodges, drumming, dancing, and so on. This will awaken many things in you and teach you much about Earth. You are coded to r itual; when you perform ritual, your body begins to remember who you are and what you know. As we see it, communities are going to be very influential in the 1990s. They will form on tracts of land that will be anywhere from fifty to a few hundred acres, perhaps as small as twentyfive acres, and they may house anywhere from thirty to one hundred peopl e. These groups will come together because the members will be responding to an i nner knowing. The new technologies th at will be used in the coming communities will be t echnologies based on love. There is nothing wrong with technology. The majo r stumbling block of technology now in use on this planet is that it is used to separate, manipulate, and control people rather than to uplif t them. Technology with love is the key. Many people will be given great amounts of technological inform ation that will seemingly come out of nowhere. Y ou may be given information for an invention and yet not have any idea what it is you are inve nting. You may have to hand it over to someone else to brin g it into reality. People will work together in harmony to bring forth this new technology. Part of the evolution of consci ousness involves uniting one conscious ness with another-not keeping yourselves separated. Perhaps one pers on will come up with an idea, a nd another one will take the idea and put it into manifestation, and so meone else will sell it. As we see it, there will be a tremendous underground market for inventions. These inventions will never be shown in th e traditional marketplace b ecause you would be wiped out, s nuffed, if it was known that you had these abilities. There will be great trading from one community to another of these underground tec hnologies that will do all kinds o f thin g s for y ou."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"It can be one of the most rewardi ng experiences of this lifetime fo r you to live in cooperation with a group of people who love the land a nd get the land-Earth-to respond.

(16) Chapter Sixteen Heretics Ahead of Time Content of „Bringers of the Dawn“, pg. 171 - 179, Chapter Sixteen. The sixties were a time of prepar ation. They held your initial awakening and were a time that showed you that new paradigms could be born. During that decade, you sudde nly became far removed from the values of the previous generations. The sixties were full of events, su ch as the movement for peace and the movement for expression of the body, which supported looking at th e body and accepting and sharing sexuality with fu ll consciousness-with clot hes off, rather than by finding body parts between layers of clothes, which is what the generation before did. Cons ciousness was birthed, and the idea o f p eace and freedom was awakene d. That was kindergarten. The nineties are the time to bring the movement of spirituality onto th e planet-not just in small pockets, b ut onto the entire planet. The planet is awakening all over. We travel the pl anet and can tell you that you have your counterpa rts in every corner of the globe. The te am of light that you represent made sure that they covered all their base s, because there are lightworkers everywhere. You are coming into you r own. The movement toward spirituality is a movement away from materialism. Over the last number of years, many people have gotten very into their bodies, regenerating them, exercising them, and making them more beautiful. That has simply be en preparation so that you could m ove into Spirit. The realm of Spirit is a very exciting place. It has more flexibility: there are places to trav el and great advent ures to be had, and there are no limitations. The reason physical reality has been so frustrating for you is becau se you bought the stories about its limitations hook, line, and sinker. Y ou bought them because you had made an agreement to do so. It was p art of your plan to buy into thes e limitations so that you could rela te to those who have no idea about light and who have been buying in to the limitations for their w hole existence. You are going to electromagnetically alter the planet-r ewire it, so to speak-so that all of these ot her beings can be plugge d in once again. You can only do this if you can relate to where they are. If you had come here with your memory banks open, either you would not have wanted to stay or you would not now understand the others. So you have been submerged in a society that has been without li g ht, and y ou have for g otten y our li g ht ( or va g uel y remembered it as y ou g rew u p) so that y ou could"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"relate to that world. Now it is time for you to integr ate that world of society into the multidimensional world of light and Spirit you represent so that the values and designs of this planet will begin to change completely. Heretics are ahead of th eir time. The heretical ideas that come onto the planet always prove to be b rilliant later. So have courage; it only seems as if these new ideas are being ridiculed. You must remember that there is much act ivity in the nonphysical realms to assist you and that, even though each of you has your own blueprint and plan to evolve into, you are part of a global b lueprint and a global consciousness. You are firing that gl obal blueprint and awakening others. You awaken in waves as each of you learns to carry information and broadcast it. If everyone were awakened at once, it would be very chaotic. The awakening must happen as you are able to handle it, b ecause putting too much light into an element that cannot handle it w ould blow a fuse. If the electrical currents are not matched up, the body can be destroye d. You will see this. You ar e going to see a disease move over the planet that has to do with the nervous system a nd memory because pe ople won't be able to handle the energy. They will beco me frightened of it. They may discover a multidi mensional portion of themselves and think they are crazy. Then they will be obsessed with keep ing their insanity quiet. from their husband or wife or children. People will drive themselves into a frenzy with this energy because they won't understand it. We cannot emphasize enough that the nervous system is the key to open your ancient eyes and see, and for you to remember who you are, where you come from, and where you are going. The nervous system must be able to take the electrical current into the body, transduce the high ener gy and fit it inside the b ody, and let the body evolve and nurtu re itself on this high energy that is consciousness. This is literally what is occurring. It is as if you were to take a new born babe and feed this babe a formul a that would force it to grow from a day-old infant to a thirty-year-o ld adult in one year. This parall els what will be happening for you ove r the next twenty years. That newbor n child would become thirty in one year. Think about what that child would have to do and what its body would have to integrate to grow like that. Think about the organs, the functions, and the hormones. Since you are committed carriers of light, there is a certain opening within your auric field. There is an opening that the pillar of light brings so that guardians can co me down and act as gate keepers for how much energy you can handle. Even though your intellect, mind, and ego may say, \"More, more, more,\" the gate keepers know that, because you are a carrier of light and have committed to a certain task, you cannot be lost. Unless, that is, you are bent on your own pers onal destruction and y ou move past what is called the highest will into the will of yourself. The nervous system, which is a hi ghway within the body, can only move at the rate you can process the data flooding over it into the cells. Many of you are stil l cleaning out caverns wi th in portions of you r being that have been filled with darkness. These caverns may be from this lifetime-they may go back to childhood-or for some of you they ma y be from other lifetimes. Many of you have been on this journey for twenty-five or thirty vears, while others of you have newly joined the journey. Not everyone is going to take the same amount of time. Those who have been plodding along for thirty years are way showers. You set up a vibrational frequency that those of you who are new joiners can feel. You who are new j oiners don't have to go looking for the new frequency and discove r it; the mapping is done, and the mapping hits your body. You all need one another.

Harmony is required. A time is coming when many of you will be put to work with Spirit to br oadcast frequency and assist others in comprehending what is going on. The wave s of awakening will cont inue, and Spirit will b ecome a way of being on this planet. That is the plan for this planet, and the creative cosmic rays from Prime Creator are hitting the fringes of your galactic system-moving here first. That is why the great gathering of energies has come he re. These energies want to partic ipate in the transformation here so that they will be prepared when it comes to th eir own area of galactic and universal existence. There is a huge transformation taking place, but what you do with it, of cour se, is up to you. We have said that your world is going to split into two worlds and that thos e who move with light will be in the world of light. This split is already beginning to take place. Those entities who wish to work with the higher vibratory fields that repres ent light, and those who wish to wo rk with the lower vibratory fields that represent fear, darkness, chaos, control, and confusion, are beginning to polarize and choose sides. Those who work with the lower vibratory fields will say to you that you are witches or the devil because you represent something that they don't understand. You represent cha nge, and you must remember that most people are frightened to death of change. On e of the curious things about human consciousness is that it is enamored of stability. You bought the concept that stabilit y is something desirable hook, line, and sinker. So you stri ve for it; you think that if you do not have stab ilitv and security then who are you? You might not exist, you might be annihilated. We are talking about many people you know; some may ev en be family members. You will need to develop a tremendous amount of patience and co mpassion for those who feel this energy and do not want to respond to it in a way that can benefit th em. You are going to have to become very allowing- p erhaps even allowing others to destroy themselv es so that they can learn the value of life. Even though human beings are not consciously aw are of it, you know in the deepest portion of you r b eings that you move from one existence to another and gather experience so th at your soul can understand and process data to give you a view of one realit y. Someday you will be able to scan the lives and existences of your soul and hold the energy of that soul just like you would hold a crystal, loo k at the different facets and sparkles within it, and feel and know that identity. When you are able to do this with your soul, your soul will be able to connect with other forms of intellige nce that it is a part o f but does not presently comprehend. We are stretching you. We want you to become complete ly confused so that you will be energized. Then you will utilize your curiosity to take you into areas that, not onl y have you never thought of, you neve r even knew existed. This is our intention-that you come to a higher ground where you can create a new order of identity courageously, with humor, and with confidence. All things are frequencie s. If you knew how rapidl y you are evolving, you might want to sit in a chai r and put your hand over your head and say, \"I can't do it. There is t oo much going on for me.\" You keep the veil pulled down and pretend to go about life as if nothing is happeni ng when you are continuously b eing upgraded with all kinds of changes to bring you closer to the higher dimensions. Think about and feel what you are going to achieve in one lifetime.

All the p ieces are coming together, but because of the vision of your ego, you do not unders tand at this time that they make the greater whole. You will be put to task, and you will find that all you are seeking will be yours. That is the good news. Be aware and learn how to recognize when your will is usurping the divine wi ll and the Divine Plan- when you are forcing too much onto yourself becaus e you are not operating out of common sense. Loo k at yourself in the mirror and see how you look. Look in to your eyes because your eyes are an indicato r for your whole physical body. Are they clear? Are you able to look back wi th clarity? Is your face lined, or exhausted, or calm? How does your body feel? Are you able to sit in a serene position? Are you able to hold your body erect, or do you feel the need to slump over? Do you fidget because you cannot hold the energy in your body-so your body is always dancing and twitching because it does not know what to do? Are your fingers always drumming, or are you gnawi ng at your flesh? Ther e are many indications to watch for. You can look around and see who cannot integrate energy. Once you bring this energy into your body and are ab le to hold it, your body will begin to feel a lightness. There will be a vitality in your skin, or perhaps your hair. Your hair is a very good indication of your health. Common sense, of course, is one of your best comrades to hang around with. Common sense will show you what is right and what is not. At times you will recognize that the energy has become too much and th at you are not calm and centered. This will occur for each and everyone of you at some point. In some way, you will feel as i f too much is happening: there will be too much data to compute, too ma ny people to talk to, or too much going on. When this happens, you must think of yourself as an applia nce and unplug your self. Just like you are a toaster, simply unplug yourself so that you can be out of use. At those times, what you need to do more than anything else is rest. Some of you wi ll need a tremendous amount of sleep at different p oints. Do not think you ar e getting lazy and beat up on yourself; simply acknow ledge it. There will be times when some of you will wish to sleep eighteen hours. Do it. It is necessary. You have no idea of the lands you travel to and the work done on your physical body when you sleep. It is the time when you are unplugged from this reality and rechar ged and taught in other realities. The bridges, and your eyes, will open between realities, and you will be gin to see and carry these memories. When you go to a Chinese restaurant, you eat Chin ese food; you don't order a hamburger.

The avatars and masters have now permeated the gridwork of the wo rld, bringing with them their own tools for teaching. The tools that ar e being utilized on this planet are artifacts that are not of you r dimension, symbolic forms that liter ally have a life of their own. They make up what is known as the Language of Light. You are implanted with a structure, a geometric fo rm, which triggers certai n information within you. It also facilitates, for those who wo rk with you, the sending of informat ion directly into your being. The large majority of you are implanted, and, if you are not now, shortly you will be if you choose to open and align yourself. No one is implanted who does not choose it. This structure of the Language of Light is a way of receiving information a nd energy to facilitate your developm ent. It is a method of learning without doing it through books or through the intellec t. It involves opening to the belief that there is indeed a hierarchy, immens e beyond your comprehension, that has been working with humanity since the very beginning. This hierarchy works with love, cherishes who you are, and has been able to see through the time mechanisms that are keyed into the planet to know th at consciousness is ready for the evolutionary leap. There are 144,000 members of the spirit ual hierarchy who are infused in the gridwork of the planet at this time. Each master has its ow n seal that represents one portion of the Language of Light, and you have 144,000 seals of energy th at will eventually be infused within your being. To start with, you will work with the twelve forms that the body wi ll be able to hold. Much later, once the transformation has occurred, th ere will be an infu sion of the entire 14-1,000 symbolic language structures through your being. That wi ll be an unfoldment that cannot even be explained in this lifetime. This mutation is a proce ss unfolding within you that will allo w you to move into another realm o f experience. Each person on the pl anet has the potential to move through this mutation. Many will stop the process because they do not ha ve the desire to align themselv es with higher consciousness. When you are aware of who you are, that is one thing. Wh en you become aware of the divine consciousness that seeds this planet-an intellect that is vast, loving, and works with you-and when you call to that consciousness and ask to be a portion of it, that is when you are implanted with the geometric forms. The forms that are implanted come in a variety of shapes such as the pyramid structure. Why is the p yramid so important? On this pl anet and throughout the cosmos, the pyramid structure is utilized to represent a great unity of consciousness. It is the stru cture that is the most diff icult to create in all of its many facets, and yet it is a structure of perfection. It is a structure that gath ers energy from Earth and sends it outward. The structures of the sphere and th e spiral will also be implanted inside you. The sp iral is very dear to many of you because you have sojourne d within cultures and societies where the spiral was utilized to communicate many ideas.

Which implant or geometric form wi ll be implanted inside you will depend first of al l on your request for alignment. It will also depend on your belief that these entities choose to be available to you if you choose to be available for them . As you begin to unfold and allo w what are called miracles o r magnificent events to manifest in your life, they will begin. Many of you will start with the implant of the circle because it represents God-form, unity, and completeness. Some of you will select the pyramid structure to be implante d since you have had many lifetimes with discovered and still undiscovered pyramids all ove r the planet. You think your geography is known, but there are many things still undiscovere d because they are sli pping from on e reality to another. Deep within jungles, th ere are many buried pyramids, of ten lying buried beneath mounds o f earth. There are still ma ny wonders to uncover. Those of you who are willing to believe that there ar e truly no limitations will be able to take the Merkabah structure and move yourself off the planet with it while you ar e still living on the planet. The desire to do this must exist in you if you are to be implanted with the Merkabah. Already some of you have attempted to travel with it, and you know how it can be used in your being. When you truly call the Merkabah to yourself, and you are willing to get the feeling of what that tr uly means-to be unlimite d consciousness that travels with your body, without your body leaving the planet-that is when implanting will occur. The Merkabah is not the highest implant ing, as there are no highest or lowest implantings. Implanting comes when it will be st suit your personal development. Once you have become implanted, there will be an unendi ng process of new forms coming into your being. You do not consciously choose the fo rm that will be implanted in you. However, you choose the life you have, which opens you to the structures of the Lan guage of Light. You choose what is important to you each day. That is your access to th ese forms. Through this marriage of energies, eventually you will all hold the alphabet of light inside your beings, and this alphabet of light will teach you. If you have dreamt of geometric forms, it is an indication that the forms are wo rking with you. Or perhaps you loved studying geometry in school. If you wi sh to know what you have been implanted with, see which forms continuously come first or are la rger than the others. There are many shapes that do not even have names. There will be shapes th at you know and recognize that later will take new forms and new shapes that your consciousness cannot translate. The spiral is one of the basic forms of the Language of Light ge ometry. It is a bridge, a teaching unto itself. The form of it is coded with information, and when you ri de the spiral, it is seemingly nonending. This shows you that the journey into your self is nonending and that the jour ney outside of yourself is nonending. You, as a species, will be able to split your consciousness and go in both directions so that consciousness can be connected. By taking the nonending journey w ithin and the nonending journey without, you link yourself up into a connected sp iral in which there is universal truth. We have said that the cells in your body contain the entire history of this universe. Ideally, you will come to realize the existence of this golden library within yourselve s during this lifetime and learn how to read what is there.

There are circles and other shapes being put upon this planet in the grain fields that are inexplicable as far as you are concerned. These imprints are a frequency, not a process or action. There is a song or story or langua ge that is being implanted on the surface of Earth with language symbols. These symbols come to establish a cer tain frequency, and they are going to increase. Eventually, some of you will build houses that are geometric shapes that are not si mply squares o r rectangles. Many of the dwellings in the Pleiades do not have sh apes as you know them, and it is understood there that shapes and angles hold ener gy. In astrology, it is unders tood that certain angles have power points and that certain things happen with certain angles. It is the same with shapes. The Great Pyramid is all about the use of angles and shapes. Energy collects in angles, in shapes, and in forms, and you can learn to create these shapes and live in and around them. Energies are formed and transmitted in this way. You will also discover that certain degrees have certain powers, and that some angles are very uncomfortable for you to be in. It is sometimes better to sleep in th e middle of a room rather than having your bed jammed into a ninety-deg ree angle, because the ni nety-degree angle creates an energy lock. In the middle of the room, the energy flows around you. In third-dimensional reality, many portals are now being opened to bring about evolution upon Earth. At one time, the planet was sealed off and put in quara ntine because there were forces that fought here. There have been incredible wars upon this planet, and some of the vestiges of these wars still exist as very barren areas upon the planet. This was the time of chaos and confusion when creator gods fought creator gods. During the most recent wave of the wars, about ten or twelve thousand years ago, Earth was sealed off because those beings who operated with light lost the battle. Light does not always win, you know. Light is not al ways the victor as you think of a victor, for li ght must learn to integrate with all p ortions of itself. Prim e Creator is within all things , and light and dark are part of the Creator. Therefore, light must incorporate with the dark portion of itself.

A number of cycles were set to pass since the last wars, after which time the energy portals into the plan et would again be opened so that light could enter. This is that time period.

Intelligence is beyond the spoken word and beyond the written word, for it is frequency that sometimes comes in geometric shapes. Pyth agoras had a beginning grasp of this, but his geometry was not understood by others.

The circles and shapes being put on Earth are here to assist you in holding and managing your frequency and having the courage to live your light. They make frequency information av ailable in a very subtle way, and no one can figure them out ye t. These shapes are all connected to one another, and if they were all written out simultaneously on some farmer's field, something w ould happen to them immediately. They are spaced from one continent to another, and they move a frequenc y band around the planet that will help activate Earth's gridwork. They will allow you not to feel so weird with what you know and to feel more comfortable with the cha nges in frequency as they occur. This is just a little bit of what the crop circles do. They are quite interesting. Many of them are designed and constructed by what some cal l Ascended Masters. There is al so a joke behind them. You must understand that some beings, as they become very evolved, develop a tremen dous sense of humor. They see the humor in all things. As we have said, geometri c shapes and forms are carri ers of intelligence. They are frequency waves that can be modulated and changed. The shapes coming onto Earth are like energy gates or energy glyphs. They hold intelligence and are being set up to even tually connect and make an intelligent gridwor k around the planet. This gridwork will have a frequency that humanity can use to evolve. The whole language is not on the plan et at this time. The glyphs come onto Earth as a result of a certain evolvement of consciousness. They work with places that are vortex centers that are now drawing them in. Over the billions of years that Earth has been in orbit, these centers have been covered over and b uried. Some have gone into dorma ncy, and many of them are bei ng reawakened because the seal around the planet has been penetrated. The crop circles are phenom enological expressions of consciousne ss. They come into your reality to show y ou that the reasonin g mind cannot control all of the data, much as it would like to. These events"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"occur to intersect with the coding of consciousne ss of all human beings. Wh enever reality cannot be explained, a certain niche is opened within consciousness. The crop circles are completely beyond the logical mind. Therefore, th ey force the consensus view of realit y to expand, since reality, as formerly designed, cannot house these events as a possibility. They are a trigge r. They force reality to move beyond its own limitations. There are a number of reasons for the existence of the crop circles. Basi cally, they exist to force reality to move-to get you feeling rather than thinking. Most who e xplore these circles think their way through the circles rather than feel their way through them. Great Britain is having a rash of them because, in general, the British have a very logically oriented consciousne ss. However, the land of the British Isles is imprinted with megalithic spiral s and stone forms that have intensel y imprinted the intuitive faculties of the inhabitants. This phenomenon has no logic to it. It is forcing a logically oriented society to recognize something that makes no sense, and it is being done in a very playful and obvious way without creating a threat to anyone's view of reality. If ships were to land everywhere, people would get upset. When corn lies down in concentric circles and doesn't even break or die, no one really gets too upset. Do you understand how energies play with you? It is necessary to do certain things so that you can' get it and figure it out without having your circuits overloaded. This language is being introduced onto the planet as a story-a glyph of information that holds a frequency to assist you in holding your own frequency. As you awaken, it is easy for others to read you and recognize you. You are monitore d all of the time, because ther e are devices that monitor the evolution and location of consciousness. Once consci ousness has reached a certain place, assistance is brought from the outside to establish other realms of that frequency. In other words, say you open a restaura nt, and it is a big hi t. You run and maintain it and sell really good food. Then someone comes along and says, \"How about franchising? Let's get you everywhere.\" These geometric shapes help you franchis e the frequency by spreading it al l over the planet and holding it. They bring you to a new level of attainment.

It uplifts you, b ecause once you are informed, you feel more powerful. When you are not informed y ou feel p owerless."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Sound is another way to carry information because it is part of light. To you it may seem that sound and light are two separate things, becau se from your point of view you perceive light with your eyes and sound with your ears. Because you use two separate areas of pe rception on your body, it seems that sound and light are separated as well. In actuality, they are very connected. They wind themselves around one another because they both carry information. Many of the structures built on this planet, particular ly ancient sacred sites, have information stored within stone. In the same way, you have informati on stored within the bones of your skeletal form. When you allow sound to move through you, it unlocks a doorway and allows in formation to flood into your body. It also penetrates the gr ound, affecting the vibrations of Earth and allowing a rearrangement of a molecular alignment of in formation to take place. Thos e of you who use sound when you are working on others' bodies bring about a rearrangement of the molecular struct ure and create an opening for information to flood in. This kind of wo rk will become more and more profound. In Tibet, when a master who was able to transcend realities passed over, the body was kept and allowed to move into its own natural deteri oration because the skeletal form held a sensibility to frequencies. informatioin is stored in bone and stone. In some places in Tibet where the lines of continuity in sects o f monks can be traced back for thousands and thousands of years, people have kept the skulls of different masters. They have very secret cr ypts and rooms filled with these skulls.. When one walks into these p laces, one can, through sound, access the intelligence factors of the humans who once occupied those skulls. Do you understand why crystal skul ls were designed? Crystalline structures are like holographic computers: they can transmit to the evolved or plugged-in human a tremendo us amount of information. They are designed like skulls to act as a code for understanding your own skull and understanding that the bone in your body is ve ry valuable. www.universe - people.com Sound is a tool for transformatio n. Keepers of Frequency, which is what we are encouraging you to b ecome, learn how to modulate the frequency they hold thr ough sound. Sound can penetrate any substance, move molecules, and rearrange realities. In ancient Egypt, the ankh, or sym bol that represented life, in act uality was a frequen cy modulator. It was utilized by individuals who we re masters of keeping frequencie s and able to do many things with those frequencies. The ankh is simi lar to a tuning fork and can direct sound. That is how it was used a long time ago. Before you will be able to expe rience using sound in the manner of the ancient Egyptians, you will have to demonstrat e your integrity. You will have to pass an in itiation or a testing to see whether you can be trusted with this kind of power. This planet is not ripe for this kind of energy simply to be thrust into anyone's hands. If you were capable of this ki nd of work at this time, your life would not be safe because there w ould be too many who w ould want to misuse your gift. You will be given abilities as you can best mature into them. You can begin to work with s ound by allowing it to \"play\" your body. Get yourself centered, clear you r mind, and allow tones to come th rough you. The ancient mystery school s worked with sound in this manner, and it is a very powerfu l technique when done in a gr oup. Many years down the road, but within this decade, you will amaze yourselves with what you will perceive as the results of you r cooperative sounds or symphonies of consciousness playing themselv es. When you tone together, you will be shown what you can do w ithout even knowing you can do it. Y ou will learn how to use and cultivate this kind of energy to make your own ankh. When you buy a child cla y, the child at first doesn't know how to make many things, so you make little ball s and spaghettis for the child so he or she can see the potential within the clay. Then the child, after playing with the clay for awhile, discovers his or her own sense of creativit y with form."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"The creative form of sound is shown to you first as a potential. You are led and orchestrated through the use of this sound. Eventu ally, you will discover on your own some of the things that sound can achieve. Then you will become more dari ng, and you will learn wh at sound can create. En ergies are introduced this way to make certain there is not a misuse of them and that you don't overextend yourself or overdo out of enthusiasm. You will go very far with your use of sound after working w ith it for awhile. It is like a powerful tool b eing given to an infant. With out proper awareness, you could do things and not realize the ramifications of what you are doi ng. Think about what sound does in stadiums and auditoriums. The cheering or booing of a crowd crea tes an ambience. When groups of you make sound together, you create an ambience for yourselves. You allow certain energies to play the instrument of your bodies. You let go of preconceived ideas a nd allow different melodies and en ergies to use your physical bodies as opportunities to represent themselves on the planet. In actua lity, what you experience is the life force of energies that you allow to express through your own selves. You become channels. Just as our vehicle allows us to come into your real ity through her body, you allow a vibration to come onto the planet in its full glory through your bodies and your joint c ooperation. You birth something. You create an opportunity, and an energy takes advantage of that opportunity. Emotion, because .it brings feeling and connects you to feeling, allows you to recognize different states of consciousness. The logical mind does not allow you to recognize states of consciousness because it holds onto its own identity. It is locked into the boundary of ego and does not want to recognize othe r areas. Feeling, however, al ways acknowledges other areas because f eeling discerns the difference. You can read the signs and the definiti ons by the energy that you call feeling. It is, in actuality, a vibration. Sound brings about states of emotional feeling. When you create harmonics of sound, it reminds you r b ody of something. It reminds your body of light, of deep cosmic love , and of other worlds. Your body comes into joy and sometimes overw helmingly into sadness. It seeks and accesses a frequency that it has b een longing for, which the sound has reminded it of. As you allow s ound to play your body, you discover a frequency that you have s ought. This frequency is connected to the evolution of the helixes within your body. Sound is a vehicle or conduit to c onnect you to the higher chakras outside of you r b ody because you do not have a way of accessing them logically. You must access all frequencies and chakra centers by feeling, and s ound will connect you with feeling, which will allow you to understand the information. If sound could be pictur ed, some of you would beco me entranced with watchi ng it. There are realities where sound does picture itself. You feel the m ovement and language of sound when you wave you r b ody or move your hands. You expe rience the richness of this form of communication and how multidimensional all things are by feeling sound express it self. It has its own language, and it has a form. Sound carries a certain frequency, a nd the body recognizes the frequency. The body is keyed to respond to the acceptability of the fre quency. The great master musicians such as Be ethoven and Mozart were coded to bring in information of a stable nature, for they received the harmonics of sound at the time when there was great darkness ove r the planet. In order to keep a certain remembrance open in the minds of the human race, lower vibrat ory rates of sound were translated into the minds of these masters. Sound is going to evolve. Now hum an beings can become the in struments for sound through toning. Human beings become the flute, the piano, the harp, the oboe, and the tuba. They allow energies to use their physical bodies to make a variety of sounds that they do not direct or at tempt to control the range of. Spirit plays, and human beings simply observe the attendance of the symphony that they and all the others are p erformin g . It is q uite p rofound."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"These harmonics can be utilized in incredible ways, for harmonics can evolve many things. One of the things that is important for utili zing these harmonics is to be ve ry silent once the harmonics are complete. The harmonics alter some thing; they open the door. Certai n combinations of sounds played through the human body unlock information and freque ncies of intelligence. Being silent for a long p eriod after the harmoni cs allows human beings to use their bodies as devices to recei ve and absorb the frequencies and to use the vehicle of breathi ng to take them into an ecstatic state. When you tone with others, you have access to the group mind that you did not have prior to making the sound. It is a gigantic leap in consciousness. The key word is harmony. When the entire planet can create a harmonic of thought, the entire pl anet will change. That is what you are working for. You are going to b roadcast a frequency, and that sound is going to travel. It is going to become a desperate aching and longing for the return to harmonic s within the human race -a return to the power of the group mind an d the simultaneous empowerment of the individual. What you intend to do with sound is of the utmost im portance. If you are not cl ear about your intentions, sound can have away of enveloping upon itself and growing beyond its original capacity. It doubles and quadruples itself with its own impact. It is very im portant for you to have a cl ear intention of what you p lan on doing with the sound. That is number one. N umber two is that sound stirs ener gy up. It creates a sta nding columnar wave, building frequency upon frequency. This energy can then be directed at or toward anything. You have heard about those who marched around the city of Jericho. They marched fo r days around Jericho and cr eated a standing wave. The wave eventually built up so much energy that the city walls imploded. N ative dance, rattling, shaking, and moving in circles creates the ener gy of this wave. When you make sound in a circle, or in the circum ference of the pillar of light, you create a column that is capable o f doing many more things than you ever realized. It is capable of creat ing explosions and of destroying and creating ma ny realities. Among the war-oriented trib es, the warhoop was used by those who went into battle. The unified and intended invocation was to ask the nonphysical forces to accompany them. The warriors would use this kind of sound to combat their opp onents by allowing energy to move through a portal and create a standing column. When you hear a sound like a warhoop, you remember uncomfortable ways that the sound has been utilized because it is very powerful. It makes othe rs uncomfortable because it reminds them of the responsibility of sound. Some of you are petrified of sound; you are petrified of the sound o f your own voice speaking out and stating with clarit y what you prefer. You have cellular memory o f what sound can achieve, a nd the impact or capability of what you can do with it is to some of you rathe r devastating. Sound can link you to pl aces where your intellect ca nnot. Your intellect strives to categorize, but you cannot categorize s ound; you must simply experience it. Misuse happens through intent. You can discover the power of sound a nd then misuse it to manipulate others. What do you experience when you live in a city and hear sirens? Fear. That is a misuse of sound, and it is altering your frequencies. It is a very base wa y to do so. Those who make the sound know the result of it on the human psyche . It is jarring and disturbing and keeps you from p lacing your attention somewhere else . That frequency is like a lock; it is hypnotizing, and it captures your consciousness and your intelligence . It is as if your intelligence cannot focus any other place. It is almost like being in a prison, beca use the sound imprisons your awareness so that it becomes addicted to or locked into a vibratory rate and does not seek anything else. It become s subdued. Think also of you r televisions or the sound comin g from other electrical devices."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"It is always upsetting to look at the different form s of frequency control and to see how powerful allies such as sound are used to control y ou.

We share these things with you for many reasons. The ultimate purpos e is to bring you to greater self- empowerment. You must realize that you are not powerless in any situ ation and that your mind is the ultimate of your creativity. Your mind and your thoughts de sign your experience no matter what method of technology is being used.

Those who are rewarded with the understanding that they are called to use sound as part of their work and who recognize that call and respond to it will evolve at a rapid pace. Those of you evolving at this rate will be called one day to represent many pe ople, to represent world gatherings of consciousness, and to change the available frequency with your sound. (19) Chapter Nineteen Igniting the Internal Flame Content of „Bringers of the Dawn“, pg. 199 - 209, Chapter Nineteen. The planet is looking for a balance in the self. Since the self is a compos ite of all things, it is a harmonic that balances all of your extrater restrial selves, multidimensional se lves, and male and female selves. You are incredibly whole beings, which you are beginning to realize. Allow yourself to blossom and come into this completeness. No one hinders you but yourself. If you allow this completion, there are vistas awaiting you that are beyond your imagination. You are discoveri ng that you need your emotional b ody and that you need both your femininity and your masculinity. You need all that you have been gifted with in order to survive and understand wh at is unfolding upon the plan et. Please realize the severity of the times that you are li ving in. As we spend tim e with each of you, you in turn will be tested and then taken to teach many others when the time comes. Through feeling, you can discover much more, for you are seeking to resolve something and make something whole within yourself. To show yourself how unwhole you are, you have created a situation of tremendous separation that appear s to be outside of yourself. It l ooks as if your drama has to do with a powerful man against a powerful wo man. Which one is going to be th e victim? Who is right and who is wrong? What is this internal drama actually saying? What is this outside mirror that images what is g oin g on inside of y ou?"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"As you access multidimensionalit y, you must merge male and fema le. You will not stop at the separation or fight between men and women that has been going on for thousands of years. Who is creating the separation between men and women' It is the creator gods , who have set up this paradigm for you and instigated these frequenc ies from other points of view. Th e separation story has served them well because of the havoc it has created. The male vibrations came into pow er in recent times some five t housand years ago. In order to slowly recognize who they were, they completely and totall y disassociated themselves from anything that was formerly in power: the matriarcha l movement and females. Females operate traditionally through the realms of intuition and feeling. Ma les have also been carriers of intuition and feeling a multitude o f times, but in this recent separation they did not carry feelings with them. There was a huge schism, and the males and females on the planet came into great c onflict. Why did this occur? It was a setup. It was set up by the creator gods who took over the planet and raided the r eality-feeding, keeping themselves alive and functioning, and nourishing th emselves off emotional turmoil. This planet has been subjected to all kinds of plan s and activities orchestrated to create greater and greater emotional turmoil. The more people involved in these activities, the more potentia l for emotional turmoil there has been. The creator gods instigated these activities and set you up to work against each other. In order to bust this paradigm, as you all are on assignment to do, you must change many of the separating structures that have been set up. Whatever the separa tion may be between man and woman, black and white, or Oriental a nd Caucasian-you must change it. You came onto the planet purposely to insert yourselves as members of the Famil y of Light in situations that are archetypal. As we have said, you are doi ng this so that you can understand the masses and transmute energy for them by being able to transmute it with in yourself. Once you make a healing o r j oining, you take it on and heal not only yourself, you heal the species and the mass psyche. Remove yourselves from your personal drama and realize that it is all symbolic. See yourself as a female entity looking for identity, and not ice how a male identity consta ntly seems to oppose you. You must discover how you can bring these iden tities together inside yourself. When this joining occurs inside you, it will automatically proceed outside you. As you have journeyed upon this planet, part of what you have come to heal is male dominion over the female. You don't need to take what you are doing p ersonally or carry it as a personal burden as if it is just yours. It is not ju st yours; it is universal. Each of you carries energies to resolve within your collective experience. As members of the Family o f Light, you each have your reincarnat ional goodies-your \"stuff\"-in areas that most impersonate you and that you find to be stimulating. Th at is why you are all different. As members of the Family of Light, you need to branch out or fan out to get the hang of being human. You need to cover the full spectrum o f experience so that you can comprehend from a cellu lar level how much need s to be transmuted, how deep the sense of powerlessness r uns, and how lost the energy of th e Goddess is from the consciousness of the species. Remember, you are creatures who have been locked in development by frequency, and your task is to b ring human beings to the place where they can be poised to consciously acc elerate human evolution. When you are locked in evolutio n by frequency and DNA manipulation, there is only a certain kind o f frequency that can broadcast. There is fighting with the self, and thi ngs seem to be more separated. As you become more complete, you do not se parate things in such a way: yo u see that all things are part o f the experience. Sometimes you become so lost in the experience of being human that you forget what y ou are here to do."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"As members of the Family of Ligh t, you have come here to transmut e for the species. As soon as you get less attached to the drarnas, you will not feel so caught up and victimize d by them. You will understand that this is a collective of energy you are dealing with. So, collectiv ely, if you can come to the realization inside yourselves , you can broadcast a ne w vibration for women and men to harmonize with. Everv time you feel as if you have made headway, you have. Do not discount the steps you have taken. You discredit yourself when you look at your behavior and judge your self or others as bad. Look fo r what you get out of everything. The conflict that is going on is actually between the male and fe male inside of you. You have not figured out how to merge your male and female parts, and there are millions of others with the same conflict. Be kind and generous to yourself. As you build cooperati on between your male and female counterparts within yourselv es, you will be able to find the coopera tion to work with one another on the p lanet and the cooperation to work with the bei ngs who come from space who are all yourselves. You all need to become sovereign. As you change , you need to have a space around you within which you can operate without feeling obligated to someone else. At the same time, you cannot make demands on someone else without allowing them the same right. You are re defining in many ways the whole concept of relationship and cooperation. Relations hip is cooperation. It is agreed cooperation o f frequency, or frequencymodulatio n blending. Many of your old ways of relating are becoming very irritating because you are discoveri ng a freedom frequency. Your assi gnment is to pull that freedom frequency onto the planet. Of cour se, you will pull it into your own life and family and relationships first. Ideally, you will learn how to be free while still being involved in an intricate number o f relationships, relatings, and relayings of life. Unfortunately, on this planet, re lationships connote ownership. When a man and woman get married, the woman's father traditionally has th e role of giving her away. In other words, a male figure must hand he r over. There is an incredible exp ectancy within relationships about another's behavior. Get clear about what your idea of relationship is, an d this will facilitate things in the long run. Just as there is no ownership with parenthood, there is no ownership in a relationship. You relate to one another as you relate energies back and forth. Ideally, there is co mmunication with all of this relaying and relating. The male vibrations give their pow er away just as much as the fe males. They give it away to a government that says, \"Here, go jeopa rdize your life. Go take a stand and shoot fo r us. If your body gets chopped up, we will take car e of you in a hospital a nd give you a bit of m oney. What the heck; go fo r it,\" and the males just obey. The chain of obeying and giving the power of the individual away is then complete. You are opening your feeli ng centers. Men tend to have greater blocks in their feeling centers than women do. Energy in the male has been stuck, because it has moved from the first chakra to the second chakra and stopped. The feel ing center in the male vi bration has not been activat ed. This is part of the experiment that has gone on for the last four or five th ousand years. The female energy, which feels and b rings life onto the planet and repr esents creativity, moved into a subm issive state in order for the male vibration to have its opportunity, w ithout feeling, to run the world. We want you to get the big pictur e. We are looking at movements of consciousness. The female, who carried the magic and the intuitive, agreed to give these up-female meaning not just female physical beings but consciousnesses who were female. Many of the native cultures that lived with Earth an d knew about life were ver y feminine. Remember, the female literall y brin g s life onto the p lanet, for life"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"comes out of the female body. The female therefore carries feelings , because you can't bring life onto the planet and not feel-unless you participate in the patriarchal movement that creates drugs to numb you from feeling. When you can' t feel life, you don't valu e life. When you feel life and participate in the creation and deliverance of life, you value life much more because you know about it. The patriarchal movement over the la st five thousand years has remove d itself from the birthing process so that it could carry out its e xperimentations involving war and th e continual annihi lation of people. The energy was purposely blocked in the male. As we mentioned, the ma le energy is very stuck. We are not pointing fingers. However, we are saving, in general, that the energy of the male species on the p lanet is very stuck in the second chakra or within the penis. Females, you ar e stuck in your throats b ecause you agreed four or five t housand years ago to be silent about the magic and intuition of what you represented and knew as one part of the twin flame. The thin flam e is the male a nd female existing in one body, whether you are physically male or female. The patriarchal society has been run by the male as pect of the self, which you all have been. You have all experimented with c onsciousness and taught yourselves about what works best, preparing for this time when the flames will be lit together in your body. At this time, the twin flame is not sought as a p artner outside of the self but is understood to be the integration of the male and fema le selves and the ripeness of all that self has done. After you have integrated the male and female within yourself and activated your own twin flame, th en, when you seek a partner, you will seek someone complete, not someone to fill the need that you have not acknowle dged or that you have not filled for yourself. During these times of change, women are going to need to open their throats and give themselves p ermission to speak out. Now is the time. And men, your challenge in understanding women and othe r men is to feel, and to let feeling enter your expre ssion of sexuality in your relationships. Many men now, are having a very difficult t ime with women. Women are driv ing men crazy. It is true. What we are suggesting for the male vibration-and also fo r the female who operate s in the male aspect of herself-is that you move into feeling in your sharing of sexualit y. Move into the emotionality o f things, rather than just the sexuality and stimulati on of the body. There is an emotional stimulation that needs emotional commitment and emotional trust. Electromagnetical lv, this emotional stimulation will open a frequency within you. This frequency that sexuality represents is a reminder of your godhood. . The male shut down his feeling center in order to experience stewardship upon this planet. He was able to carry on war and to kill and dominate the planet because he had shut dow n his feeling center. The female agreed to have her speaki ng center shut down so that the male would have the opportunity to experience being in charge of this system. All of this is now coming to a poi nt of stabilization or equalization. The female began to open her throat about thirty years ago, making the opportunity to speak fashionable. The problem is that many females ended up shutting down their feeling centers as they opened their speech centers . They began to become very much like males. A balance is needed. Now the female is findi ng the need to awaken the feminine p rinciple inside herself. She is in a female body a nd has mastered the use of the male vibration within herself. She has gone out into the world, and she feels powerful. She can walk the street s without a veil on her face, and she can decide whether she want s to be married. She is her own property. She is responsible in this country for he r own decisions. She is beginning to soften and to awaken the portion of herself that nurtu res her and brings he r life. As she makes herself whol e with her male and her female p ortions and allows herself to experience the e volved DNA, she broadcasts this frequency. This fre q uenc y will become ver y p revalent u p on the p lanet."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"It is inevitable that men will open their feeling ce nters. That is the next step men must go through to establish a balance with the female. This will happe n very quickly for men. It will not be a thirty-yea r p rocess because men at this time are moving as a populace into confus ion. Men are realizing that they don't like what is occurring, a nd they are questioning authority. At some point, the frequencies will become predominant. The n, for example, a person may be experimenting on an animal in a laboratory when their feeling cente r is suddenly and radically opened. The person feels the pain that the animal is feeling, and what they have been doing becomes abhorrent. They turn around and walk away from the laborator y and never go back because they are so shaken. This is what is coming for the male vibration. We have said that the male vibrat ion will transform in a very short period of tim e. We will not tell you why or how because some of you will consider it to be entirely too om inous. However, we will say that, as the waves continue to come, there will be a unilateral rising of consci ousness within the population. At a certain point, when me n are in the deepest struggle of master ing feeling, the feeling center will be activated. This will either occur gent ly, or it will be blown wide open. Women at the same time will be hi t, infused, and envelope d with the opening of th e heart chakra so that they can have compassion while they watch their me n feel. We are speaking of mass events that will trigger people through waves of light. Female energy, that which feels a nd connects life to life, is being awakened in ev eryone. Women must redefine their ideas of femaleness a nd strength. They must find what it is to be strong as females, just as men must discover what it is to be vulnerable as males. What is the endearing aspect of the male when he is vulnerable? What is the end earing aspect of the female when sh e is in self-empowerment-when she is a feminine version of empowerme nt and not a masculine version? Women have had a hard shell around their energy fields; they have been protecting themselves. Now they are going to develop true emot ional strength. That hard outer sh ell will diffuse, and the light body will radiate from the heart. The goddesses and the gods are agreeing and working with this energy. It is so decreed that this is how the drama will unfold. The old stories have be en buried and covered that recount the magic of the female, the creator, the one able to bri ng birth, the one holding the myst ery of blood-the life force-and the one able to put that life force back into Eart h. Where are the stories of the Goddess-she who loves and feels and nurtures? The male species used to have Goddess energy inside, too, and felt the need for the Goddess.

We have said you are an experiment. At times, the experiment has been uplifting and l oving, but in recent times it has moved into incredible decay. You, as members of the Fa mily of Light, have come to raid this planet and p ull light back onto it so that th e nonsense of separation and war neve r need be believed again. Man and woman are meant to complement ea ch other, not oppose each other. Remember, feeling is emotion. Emotion is the key to getting off this pl anet; it is the key to figuring out the multidimensional self, healing it , and becoming one. It is also the key to lovingly ac tivating Earth as a Living Library, returning a valuab le area of existence from exti nction.

You have been automat ons, performing roles that were given to you to keep you separated. You do not have a pantheon of powerful female creator images. You have nothing on which to pattern a p ositive image of the empowered femin ine. So men are striving to be male and women are striving to be empowered through a male vibrati on because you do not have a clear vision of the empowered female. You must create it. Begin to recognize the wealth of energy in the female version of self, which is intuition, receptivity, creativit y, compassion, and nourishment. You are discovering that there is a wealth of identity in an essence that has been discredited for along time. If you are fe male, of course, you are a living form of that esse nce. Men must discover their form of the Goddess within themselves where the Goddess meets the god in them. By the same token, the view of the masculine is distorted. You do not have an example of an empowered, feeling male. Society has deemed feel ing males \"soft\" and lackin g in masculinity. Men are beginning to look at their emotions and say, \"Hey, I feel this,\" and know that they are still men. So men and women are both creati ng role models for empowered, inte grated versions of masculine and feminine. These models are coming, and they are co ming quickly. The time for separation is finished. As we mentioned, it is not outside yourself that you are looking for a twin flame partner. You are looking for the integration of the female and male essence within yourself. They make one whole. Whole people are looking to connect with other whol e people in relationships that are based on trust, desire, and choice. The rela tionships are not based on \"I need you in my life to complete me and validate me.\" You become complete in yourself and operate wi th someone else who is complete in themself and offers a whole new te rritory to explore. When you marry that twin flame inside yourself, you are recognizing the intuitive, Goddess, life- b ringing, sensitive portion of yourself as well as the portion of your self that is powerful, rational, and intellectual. One that is very much of the Earth plane and the other is very much of the spiritual plane. When you merge these energies togeth er in yourself, it will be impera tive that you fi nd someone who has the same qualities. You will not fit with someone who is not integrated and whole. You will automatically draw whole people to yourself, a nd it will be effortless. You will be able to plug into one another out of desire and recognition, not out of need. You will ac hieve something that you never recognized as a possibility in any relationshi p before, and you will give relationship a very new p ersonality, a new boundary, and a ne w definition. You will become your own role models for this new type of relationship. Many of you will find that the marriage institution is meaning less. It will not fit and house what you know or how- you want to live. As all of you are on the path of integrating the polaritie s within yourselves, diff icult issues are going to come Lip over and over again. Welcom e the difficult times, for they can be your greate st teacher. Stay focused on your own growth, your own path, and your own self, and no t on what others are doing. Call on your own internal masculine an d feminine and set up a dialogue be tween them so they can begin to work in partnership and harmony. Gi ve yourself a lot of love and en couragement. Make an appointment with yourself and say, \"I love you, self. You are a wonderful self.

(20) Chapter Twenty Sexuality-A Bridge to Higher Levels of Consciousness Content of „Bringers of the Dawn“, pg. 211 - 223, Chapter Twenty. When the library of yourselves was torn from the shelves and scattered, and the DNA was split so that there were only two strands le ft with very little data and very litt le memory, sexuality was left intact in the physical body. It was left as a fo rm of reproduction, of course-as a form for th e species to stay in touch with its own essence and bring itself into life. Very deep in side the mechanism of sexuality is a frequency that can be attained th at has been sought afte r and misunderstood by many people. It is called orgasm. The orgasm has been distorted fro m its original purpose. Your body has forgotten the cosmic orgasm o f which it is capable because society has taught you for thousands and t housands of years that sexuality is b ad. You have been taught this in order for you to be controlled and to keep you from seeking the freedom available through sexuali ty. Sexuality connects you with a frequency of ecstasy, which connects you back to your divine source and to information. Sexuality has been given a bad name upon this plan et, and that bad name is stored in your cellula r memory. This is not just from this lifetime; it is from thousands of ye ars of misappropriation and misuse. It is necessary for you to clear the negativity surrounding sexuali ty from this lifetime, as well as to experience and examine how you utilize sexual energy and sexual expression in you r multidimensional selves. The sexual parts of the body are avenue s to pleasure that create frequenc ies that heal and stimulate the b ody and potentially lead it to its hi gher spiritual self. Sexuality is so misunderstood on th is planet that, when it is exchanged between two persons, very seldom is there an intent to connect spirituality with it. Sexuality invokes a spiritua lity that is free and that looks at itself as a creator. However, very seldom is sexualit y used as a brid g e to take y ou to hi g her levels of consciousness."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"We have spoken with a number of individuals who have been uti lizing light. Sinc e finding the prope r p artner in a monogamous situation, they have been able to achieve very high states of being. Monogamy tends to work for most of you very well because of where you are vibrati onally. When you have many p artners, you tend to be less than honest and to hide who you are: you share a little here, there, and everywhere in scattering your seed. It is best to be wi th one person, but this does not mean the same p erson forever. Be loyal, be open, and be sharing wi th the person you are work ing with, and go as far as you can with them. If it happens to be your whole life, wonderful. If it doesn't, then when you come to a p lace where you are no longer communi cating and serving one another, and you feel the relationship is not going to be able to make a leap, terminate the relationshi p and find another pe rson who works with your vibration. When you work one-on-one intimately, you develop trust. Most of you ha ve difficulty trusting yourselves because you don't have a role model for tr ust. You can learn about trust in a relationship b ecause a relationship acts as a mirror for you, showing you what you ca nnot see from your own viewpoint. It shows you yourself outside of your self when you have ope n communication within sexuality and deep intimacy, and when you are not us ing sexuality as a distraction for getting close. Many of you have used sexuality as a distraction and a way to avoid inti macy rather than to develop it. You begin to get energo and to look in to one another's eves and to feel all hot and exci ted. Then, instead of exploring each other intimately and spirit ually, you shut down your feeling centers, put on you r armor, and have shallow, genital sex because it is too frightening and too intense to go the deeper route of full body and full spiritual conn ection. Sometimes hot sex feels grea t and is wonderful. We are simply saving that there is more. There is much more, a nd no one is keeping it from you except yourselves and the beliefs and fear you have of le tting down your boundari es and walls. Many of the fears you have are based on what you ha ve created for yourselves and what you have done to others in your sexual life. Your sexual history affects every other portion of your soul, so all of you r soul's issues are broadcast loud and clear throughout your body. You don't want to look at this sometimes because it is too painful, and you judg e it because you think it is bad. Stop judging, and get neutral about what you have done-no matter what y ou discover, no matter how heinous it seems, no matter how difficult it seems, and no matter how much violation it involves. Understand that you r p urpose has been to gather data and to understand your selves. Sexuality is a frequency. It repres ents what was not taken away from you even though your history, you r memories, and your identity were removed and scatte red. The way you were left intact with the ability to discover who you were was through the sexual experience. Of course , you were never taught this. We are going to do some church bashi ng here. So sorry for anyone who is a member of the churches. The churches came about as organizations- b usinesses to control religion and spiritual development and to create jobs, to create a hierarchy, and to create a cl ub. Very few churches came about with the idea o f b ringing information to people. You don't usually think of religi on as something that keeps you informed, do you? Any religion that br ings information is a religion ope rating on the vibration of truth. Spiritual realms are places of ex istence that the human bodyis locked away from. Because sexuality was an opportunity for human beings to regain their memo ry, or to connect with their spiritual selves and spiritual creator, or to find an avenue to the spir itual realm that you are seal ed off from, the churches came about and promoted sexuali ty for procreation. They tau ght you that the only reason you had sexuality was to produce little humans. Sexuality was promoted as something very bad. Wo men were told that sexuality was something they had to undergo to serve men and th at they had no control over the birthing process. Women believed this; hence, to this day, you believe in general that you have no control ove r that portion of your body. You must realize that onl y y ou decide whether y ou are g oin g to birth a child or not. This is not such a"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"complicated thing as you have been told. Decision a nd intention are what bri ng the experience to you r b eing. You can control whether you have a baby or not. If woman had had this ability for the last several thousand years, and if she had been able to expl ore her sexual self without fear of having a child, p erhaps men and women would have di scovered that they were much free r than they had been told they were. The discovery of the highest frequenc y of sexuality arises fr om the love experience. It has nothing to do with relationships being either homosexual or hetero sexual. It has to do with two human beings bringing p leasure to one another in a way that opens frequencies of cons ciousness. You have bought many ideas about what is proper and what is improper within sexual expression. Love is the essence that is to be created in al l relationships. If you love and honor someone, it doesn't matter what your composition of de nsity is. What matters is the love vibration and how you explore this love, which ideally is gifted and coupled with the integration of th e male and the female counterparts that make the twin flame. Ideally, sexuality is explored through feelings. The third and f ourth chakras connect you to the emotional and compassionate selves, which connect you to the spiritual se lf. The spiritual self is the part of yourself that is multidimensional through which you exist in many forms simultaneously. It is vou r assignment and agreement and task to be aware of a ll these realities in the id entity that you are. When you are aware, you can time into th e different frequencies, rememb er who you are, and change the vibratory rate of this universe. We love to talk about sexualitv because it is so mvst erious upon this planet . Certain mystery schools have held some of the knowledge about the poten tial uses of sexuality in secrecy. You are electromagnetic creatures , and when you come together physica lly with another human creature, you b ond your electromagnetic frequencies together. When your frequencies are attuned and joined by a love frequency, incredible things can occur. Thousands of years ago, when society had more of a matriarchal view in certain areas of the planet, Goddess energy was coming through a nd working with certain individua ls. The female understood he r p ower, her intuition, her fee ling center, her connection, and her desire to create life. She also understood that she never had to conceive a child if it was not her intention to do so. In order for the patriarchal society to come full circle and prepare Ea rth for this shift in consciousness, female energy needed to take a b ack seat. So female power, energy, and understanding of sexuality were suppressed. In modern time s the past two thousand years-it came to be upon the planet that women b elieved they had no control over wh en they could have children, th at sexuality was deemed bad and disgusting, and that sex was taught to be performed on ly within the rights of marriages and so on. All o f this was a marketing program. Some of the present-day marketing programs to create an even greater fear of sexuality and its expression are the new diseases: AIDS , herpes, and all the other things . You read about these things in your newspapers and become fright ened of your own expression, fri ghtened of your own intuition, and frightened of your own joy. Do you understand? Before DNA was rearranged, the way many people reached the higher realms and were able to climb the ladders of themselves and reach into off-planet fr equencies was by electror nagneticallv bonding through love. They created a rocketship-like experience to propel them out into other systems of reality. This has b een one of the best-ke p t secrets u p on the p lanet."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Many we have spoken to have had absolutely prof ound experiences with their sexuality. We would like to point out again that we are not making distin ctions or judgments about who you happen to bond with in a relationship, and we suggest that you give up th at judgment as well. It is old programming. It does not matter whether you bond with a member of the opposite sex or a member of your own sex. We are talking about two humans coming t ogether by physically joining them selves in whatever ways are appropriate for them to join and cr eate love, because they are sharing love. When integrity and love are missing from a joining of human bodies, that is when human be ings do not think well of thei r experience. This can create all kinds of damaging results within the physical body. You were left with the frequency of the orgasmic experience in se xuality so that you could remembe r your higher identity. When this en ergy or history of yourself is revealed and you discover who you are, you will unite many bodies of your pe rsonal multidimensional identity in your physical form. To receive the full impact of the gridwork of your identity, let th e twelve helixes fit in your body and allow the light-encoded filaments to rearrange themselves. This process ha s to do with the mental body, which is of course connected to the phys ical body. The emotional body, which is connected to the spiritual body, is the body that everybody wants to sk ip. You say, \"I want to evolve. I want a rapid acceleration, but I do not want to go through the feeling center to do it.\" You are connected to your multidimen sional selves through your feelings, and it is in your feelings that you primarily get stuck. Accept that your \"stuff\" comes up for a reason. Many of you would like to bury your \"stuff\" and throw it out in the trash as if it is something ugly and not who you are. This \"stuff\" is the shadow portion of your identity that you don't like to deal with or accept. We understand that sometimes, wh en something comes Lip, you label it and say, \"I hate this part o f myself. I want to just finish it a nd sweep it under the rug and forget it. I'm finished with this stuff.\" Guess what. Your \"stuff\"-your issues-are the treasures of your life. They are how you learn. You have agreed to mutate, to pull light into your body, and to birth the Family of Light on this planet. Since light is information, you must deal with all of the things yo u have hidden from yourself. Sexuality is the primary issue because it is th e secret self-the self you hide from . Society has said to you, \"This is good. This is bad. You are to do this. You are not to do this.\" Who gave you these laws? Who gave you any of your laws to begin with? You have been stuck because you can 't read the symbols of the langu age you are speaking to yourselves. So you dwell upon it. Many of you love your stories because th ey get you attention. If you didn't have a story, who would talk to you? Observe your body and se e what it is teaching th e self. Ideally, you will heal the sore and create a place of greater co mfort and joy as you learn to dwell more completely in you r p hysical body and have a new id entity of your sexuality. Sexuality is a key. It is a doorway to the higher re alms of conscious ness. As you redefine yourselves, and the light-encoded filaments gi ve you a new definition of yourselv es, you are going to change who you are sexually as well. Sexuality mu st come up for all of you, and, we will say from experience, it is the area that you are most frightened of at this ti me. We guarantee there will be more frightening areas later. If you are stuck on the idea of l ove and cannot comprehend what is going on with it, your difficulty is that you are looking for love outside yourself. You are looking for somebody else to put meaning in your life and validate you. If you do not have that person, you become angry or feel you are worthless.

If you would stop feeling sorry for yourselves, you would find that there is so much data constantly being blasted at you that you may wa nt to be alone so you can have a good time receiving the contact. When you love yourself and stop getting convoluted about the need to have someone else love you, you are able to accept what someone offe rs. It is imperative that you valu e yourself so that you do not settle for a love disguised. If you decide to go for a partne r or to vibrate with someone, and you do not receive what you want, do not whine or nag or pout about th e person to make them change according to you r needs. If you set a value for yourself and do not create it, then simply change your reality and continue onward alone until you meet so meone who reflects your va lue. All the while, vibr ate in the love of the self, honor the self, and understand th at the journey here is about selfdiscovery in relationship to others. It is not just about husba nds or wives. The journey here is a bout honoring your phys ical body and the uniqueness of the self as you touch th e lives of many. Always allow yourse lf to work with the self and let the self evolve. You are all afraid of being intima te with yourselves-of being alone with the self. Once you develop an intimacy, a silence, a self-love, an d a containment of your energy, th en you will want to make that aspect of intimacy your standard for intimacy with someone else. Sexuality can be very confusing at this time because you are rais ing and studying your frequencies. When you join bodies, even when you hug one anot her, you exchange frequency. When you have a sexual experience, there is a hor monal release inside the body. The hormones awaken certain energies inside the cells, and there is a tr ansference of one person's essence onto the other person. That is why when vote have had sexual experiences with some one volt sometimes cannot get their energy off vote. Even though you don't want to be with the person, the sexual experience stays with you because you have had an electro magnetic exchange. You are going through this frequency modulation and learning how to raise your frequency to a place o f consistent information, self-love , and self-intimacy. Therefore, it can seem very confusing and sometimes frightening to take th is vulnerable thing you are learni ng about yourself and layer up and merge with another. The more you become aware, the more you take charge of how you use your body, where you plug it in, where you sit it down, an d certainly who you mix it with sexually. If expressing yourself sexually now encouraged your greatest growt h, you would automatically create that experience for yourself becau se you would be ready for it. Unde rstand that, during the process o f evolving the self, very often a period of dormanc y in sexual activity occurs. Within the sexual frequency, you exchange with one another. So if you are bonding yourself and chemically exchanging with a person who is not of your likeness, you are taking on their garbage because you are exchanging energy quite intimately. Sometimes you will be led away from that kind of exchange. Y ou may think, \"Oh, my goodness, what is happening? Am I turning old? Am I drying up? What is going on?\" That is not the case. You can learn to use the energy that would stim ulate you sexually without giving it over to another person. Instead o f getting chaotic and crazy, you may explore that en ergy by practicing the art of masturbation, knowing that it is perfectly legitimate and fine to do it. Or , you may want to simply obs erve that you feel a sexual arousal and decide what you are go ing to do with it. You may say, \"W ell, I'm not going to act on this now.

You cannot find answers by dialing the telephone all day long and asking everyone else for them . If you attempt to, you are demonstrating that you are looki ng outside of yourself. When you lear n how to turn within to find answers, the self will speak. Usua lly you cannot hear because you are lo cked in behavioral patterns that you know you have to change but that you don't want to change because you don't know who you will be. In all honesty, you are afraid of your selves. This is a very common th ing. You are afraid you will not be complete, and you want to be comple te very much. So you say, \"I am complete. I am sovereign. I need someone else. I am attracted to someone. Oh, no, I ca nnot look. I am too frightened of that. I don't need anyone. I do need someone.\" You go back and forth. Learn to st ill your mind. Le arn to become completely in charge of your en ergy. What does that mean? It mean s that wherever you are, you observe yourself-how your body is positioned, how you are us ing your hands, whether y ou are repeating yoursel f over and over again, whether you are speaking or silent. Learn to wa tch yourself with no judgment. Learn to watch and selfco rrect by determining how you would like to be versus how you are. Learn to quiet your mind. Frequency is carried from you to another person particul arly if there is a love bonding. A love bonding does not mean that you are going to cleave to one anot her forever. It simply means that you are in a relationship for however long you deem that relations hip appropriate in that you honor one another and exchange energies and let the ener gies flow as if through open ci rcuitry. When you do not love anothe r and you are not bonded, there is no exchange; the ci rcuitry does not open. It does not mean that you cannot have good sex; it simply mean s that the circuitry is not open. As this electrical current is rais ed higher and higher, there are grea ter heights of orgasmic experience that the human body can receive because the nervous system is able to handle the higher ecstatic frequencies. The nervous system will determine how you express your self and how you feel. If you have a poorly evolved nervous system, your sexual experience will be ve ry limited because the nervous system conducts the electrical curren t. The orgasmic experience brings about a healing and realignment of the physical body. Eventually, you will not be able to get close to or be with someone who is not operating at the same voltage you are. You simply wi ll not fit. It would be like putting a size nine foot into a size two shoe. It won't work or be comfortable. You won't fit b ecause you won't be able to merge vibrationally. You will eventually understand the importance of vibrational nourishm ent as you begin to link sexually. Linking sexually is only one way of merging with people who are movi ng at the same or a compatible voltage rate. Your realit y is very interesting to us because you have so many clues in your waking world. When you go to a foreign count ry, your electrical app liances do not plug in. They don't fit, so you need an adapter. It would be stressful if you ha d to continuously adapt to a vibration when you were involved intimately in a sexual re lationship. It would be too much effort. You would spend all you r energy creating the adaptive mechanisms.

That is simply body aerobics in the area of sexuali ty. We want you to get into the aerobics and contortions of the s oul-the vibration. The depth of tw o people coming together and linking in this capacity is what you all crave. If you are frightened of it, it is because you don't have a framework or role model for it. You must design one. You must trus t that somehow the energy in the design of the cosmic blueprint wi ll instantly bring about a new move ment based on the desire for this next step of understanding yourselves. You will remember with great clarity your e xpressions of sexuality in your different manipulations through reality-when you have been both men and women and explored sexuality in every aspect. It takes courage to do this. If there is one area in which you really judge yourselves, and in which the p lanet does great judging, it is sex. Y ou have had some definite ideas a bout what is sexually proper and improper. So, many of you may be shocked to re member what you have done with your sexuality. Understand that, on this planet, sexuality has always been the body's link to it s higher frequency. Even though much of the data was scat tered and disassembled in the body, this potential to create life remained for you to completely understand who you are at the base of your being and at the core of who you are. Sexual vibration has been your link with your cosmic identity, but this whole concept has been completely misunderstood and lost. We are simply sayi ng that there is a bigger st ory and that it is much more exciting than anyone has dare d to believe. There were those who did not want you to be in tune with these frequencies because the sexual frequencies coul d have taken You to area s of liberation where you would have begun to figure things out. Sexuality wa s left as a frequency for you to ride through the nervous system and connect with the higher mind by going out of your body. If you had been told that this was the route out, who could ha ve controlled or manipulated you? The population must clear the ne gative connotations and judgments that have colored your sexual experience for eons. You must make peace with sex in order to integrate the frequencies and identity. Things have been manipulated and given a boundary of limita tion so that the truth of sexuality has been kept from you. You have been told that you can procreate with it and have or gasms, but you have not b een told that you can open frequencies with it. You can come into contact a nd use it as a method o f remembering who you are and altering th e vibrational frequency of your body. In the next few years, your expression of sexuality will have a whole new dimension. You will evolve and grow, provided that you have a pa rtner who is willing to take the same route and to be that open. But if you are with someone who wants to play the a voidance game or the game of denial, you will not get there.

These chakras are information centers or vortexes that, onc e activated, begin to spin. When they spin, they create a movement inside your body that activates the light-en coded filaments to work together, rebundle, and form the twelve evolving helixes in the body.

Move from left to right, spinning ar ound and focusing your vision on your thumb, counting and spinning. We recommend that you spin thirty-three times at le ast once a day. You may build up to the thirty-three spins very slowly. If you are able to work up to thirty-three sp ins, three times a day, so that you are spinning ninety-nine times, well, we will see how long you stay on the planet-or at least in this dimension. When you complete spinning, however many times you spin, bri ng your palms togethe r at chest level. Press them toge ther, keeping your eyes open, and ba lance yourself with your feet a shoulder's width apart so that you feel anchored and still feel th e spinning at the same time. This tremendously accelerates the sp inning of the chakra systems inside your body, which tremendously accelerates the rate at which y ou can inter p ret and receive data."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"So, the methods to use are intent ion, breathing, using the pillar of light, and spinning. We will add a p ostscript to these. As you are elect ronic beings who are a ltering your frequency at a very fast rate, we would recommend that you drink a tr emendous amount of wate r: fresh water, purif ied water, or spring water. Water acts as a condui t or conductor. It keeps your system open and flowing. There are many other things you can do. Learn to have altered-state experiences and not feel out o f control. Cultivate them and go into them to gather information, change probabilities, move onto the corridor of time, a nd alter your own lives. Then come out of them with complete and total use of you r will with respect to how you use these altered states. When you lear n to do this, the acceleration will be absolutely phenomenal. When ther e are many consciousnesses on the planet registering that kind o f ability, the whole network that orga nizes and monitors human conscious ness alters itself . More energy is able to come onto the planet because there are those who can accommodate it. Everyone can learn to accommodate and honor this energy , because it must be housed. It is like an oil well. What good do oil well s do if they are untapped and shooting off here, ther e, and everywhere? Very little; they just create a mess. However, when you take energy gifts from Earth such as oil wells o r sources of natura l gas or waterfalls and you combine them with your will, you put together a purpose o r way of directing the energy. Then a wealth occurs for those of you who direct these natural resources. The most essential aspect of this entire process of directing and housi ng energies is to value Earth and her experience first and foremost. Y ou are being given an incredible na tural resource at this time, and you must tap it and direct it. Then you will all become very weal thy individuals in the realms o f accessibility and mastery. Many of you want to reach th e higher realms and stay there, forge tting that your task is here on Earth. You must learn to stay grounde d. The necessity of being grounde d is something many of you do not understand. You will soon find out th at if you move into greater a nd greater acceleration and you do not have grounds-things to connect you and pull the worl ds into one you may have difficulty with you r nervous systems. When frequency changes and more light comes into the body, the typical vehicle b egins to receive much more data. Sometimes yo u get very bored living in your world, and you just want to come into data receptiv ity and forget about what you consid er the mundane world. If you are not grounded, you will not have a way of al lowing that information to enter your reality and be put to use. It could simply overload your system, or you could not be able to translate what you are getting and stay calm. You need to balance many worlds at once. How do you do this? By intent ion, by practice, and by decree. Grounding allo ws worlds to merge and allows you to access many worlds. It allows you to feel surges of energy and then to dire ct these surges of energy where and when you need them-to become superhuman. A good way to ground yourself is to go outside and si t on the ground. So go outside and be in nature. Stand or sit next to a tree for awhile. Put your chair in the sun and read a book wi th the sun shining on you. Or go swimming, or put your feet in water. Th ese are the elements. They make up Earth, so you can feel them. As you evolve and your entire spec ies moves to merge di mensions, your nervous systems must be able to translate all of this informat ion that will change how you define your world. This is coming. In the last year, the information that you may have known for years has become much more public. Many more people who have not been in terested in extraterrestrials or personal development have become either interested or at least aware of these things. They are aware that there is a growing movement and that somethin g is chan g in g all over the world, not j ust in the United States."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"There is a conflict of ener gies at this time, which you could call either a skirmi sh or a grand battle. The b attle is going to become grander still because it is a battle over whose frequency will prevail on this p lanet and who will own, manipulate, and train your frequency. Who ar e you, as a frequency in disguise as a human, and what specifically is your job in this time? It is essential to know who you are and What you are doing wh en you are doing it. As you become interdimensional and multidimensional, and as the frequencies alter and the energies accelerate, you r b ody goes through a drastic rapid ch ange that the nervous system, the conveyer of information, must handle. You must learn to handle ma ny realities at once, to realize that you are doing th is, and to have a place- Earth-to translate information int o. You would not be here if it wasn't important for you to groun d information and energy into Earth. So whenever you find yourself electrified or energized, realize that you are in an altered state. Realize also how many vers ions of altered states there are and that you must instruct yourself to become a condui t, like a big pipeline. When you know you are in an altered state and are being given informati on, healing energy, exaltation, or upliftm ent, act as a pipeline. Funnel the energy through yourself, and acknow ledge and recognize that you are in a multidimensional expression. Register this, but do not analyze it . Just let the energy filter thr ough you into Earth, and it will make more sense later on. You can discover your emotional body by making a decree that you believe emotions can be trusted. Decree that you believe emotions ar e good, that they are safe, that they can take you somewhere, that they are beneficial, and that they are not just in the way or misunderstood. Any time emotions are released in you, look to see what they do for you. Wh en you have a fight with your child and your child screams at you and then afterwards you feel bad a nd cry, look at your emotion. What is the emotion doing for you? Whenever you are in emotion, you are accessing inform ation from many realities. Find that frequency and hold it. It is somewhat of a universal be lief that emotions are uncontrollabl e. They are not. You can control emotion, and you do not have to go out of control. Emotion can become a frequency inside of you through which you feel to the depth and core of your being. Yet, someone ma y look at you and not have any idea that anything is going on with you. This doe s not mean you are blocking; it simply means you have set up a way to feel an emotion and not feel ba d about it or good about it but just recognize you are feeling it. See what you can do wi th an emotion. Where does it take you? What is the next step? Disengage from the event that br ought about the emotion. That wi ll help some of you. www.universe - p eople.com Bodywork serves to bring about a release. You have used the tis sue and muscle of your body as armor to cover up your skeleton. This tissue has compacted and burie d itself and kept what is in the skeletal form from rising to the surface. You wa nt to access information that is within bone, for bone is where the story is held, while the blocks are held in tissue. You must go through al l of these layers to get to the truth inside your body. Your blueprint, or what you came ont o this planet to achieve, begins to get excited when you get close. This is just like the game you played when you were a child; you would hide something, and when someone got close, you would say, \"w armer.\" Your body gets excited as your blueprint begins to take over and you move out of your logi cal mind and into experience. Th at is because you are aligning yourself with your purpose. Your body, not your mind, takes in the information. If you allow you r emotions to have a free reign, y ou will have a much more satisfyi ng experience than if you judge you r emotions, do not understand what y ou are g oin g throu g h, and attem p t to control them."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"You need your emotious. We cannot emphasize that enough. Some of you pride yourselves on the fact that you don't have emoti on. This will not work much longer because you will find th at what you pride yourself on will bring about your destruction. You may feel as if you have worked things through with your parents. It would be more accurate to say that you have had as much vision as has been poss ible at a given time. Wh en you experience some sort of bodywork or crystal work, or you create any kind of movement to higher ground, you get a bigge r p icture. Information is stored and wr itten in stone. Information is also stored and writte n in bone. That is why it is important to work with the sk eletal structure, because it houses much of your experience in this lifetime. Let things come out, and do not chastise \\-ourself because you thought you were finished with certain events. Say, \"This is wonderful! There is more here. I love it!\" Use the experien ce as if you are discovering a gold mineas if you are discovering th at you are a newly birt hed, wealthy person. All you go through is what you decide you have to go throug h. You don't know how much you are clearing. You are opening av enues of consciousness for the plan et, not just for yourselves. The good thing is that what you are clearing now is the easier stuff. Some of the far-out bizarre stuff will come later when you will be so blase about it that it w on't make any difference. Ev erything happens in its own time. The mutation occurring is the evolut ion or plugging-in of internal data to external data. The clearing occurring is the accessing of all the emotional bodies you have been frightened of using. You need to access your emotional body in order to understand your spiritua l body. As we have said, the mental b ody and the physical body go hand in hand, while the emotional body and the spiritual body go hand in hand. Because the spiritual body is nonphysical and you are locked in the physical realm, you must access the whole realm of the nonphysical through your emotions. Human beings tend to love their dramas so much th at they can get lost in the process of processing. Processing can become a way of life. This is not useful. It is not \"c ool\" to always be processing and saying to people, \"Don't call me, I'm processing. I'm deep in my stuff. I can't figure it out.\" Yes, you r p ersonal dramas need to be examined. Yes, your personal dramas are a banquet of nourishment fo r yourself. But, eat the food and get on with life and make yourself another banquet. Quit holding onto these gems of your past and being so frightened that if you resolv e these issues you will never have anything else exciting come up agai n in your lives. It is good to put processing in perspective. The human body is evolving and changing. It may believ e that it needs a certain nutritional combination b ecause this is what you have b een taught. Ideally at this point, however, you will forget what you have b een taught. You will listen to your body and let your body tell you what it wants. We would guess that many of you in the last year have changed the thi ngs you want to eat. You no longer feel comfortable eating what you used to eat because the vibration within certain food is so intense that it is not compatible with you. In the meat i ndustry as you know it, the cattle, pi gs, and chickens are not fed food. They live in small compartments, and many of them do not see the li ght of day. Many of them defecate on top of one another because they li ve in layers of small metal boxes. This is how they are raised. They are fed steroids and antibiotics-th ings other than food. They are not raised with love . When they are taken to slaughter, they are also not killed with love. So you are in gesting this vibration. Remember that all things exist as a vibration. Animals were put upon the planet to be companions fo r you, to live on the land, and to feed you and shelter you if n ecessary. This was to be done with love. I f y ou live on a farm and raise y our own chickens and p i g s, and if y ou feed them food, and if, when it"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"comes time to bring them to sla ughter, you do it with compassion and love, then it is fine. You give quality of life to the animals, a nd then the animals in turn recycl e themselves to give you love and quality of life. That is the ideal. Th at was the reality for a long time upon this planet . It is not the reality any longer. Be aware of the vibration within things. Let your body speak what it wants. Let yourself be willing to cha nge, because your body, as it attempts to raise its vibration and build a light body, will move away from certain foods. Intend that you wish to change your diet and then intend that things come to you. We emphasize ove r and over again that you are much more than physical beings . You exist in many real ities, and you have a multitude of guides. So each of you needs to beco me more clear in your intentions. What do you want State, \"I want to evolve. I want to change my diet. I wish to have a greater sense of intu ition.\" Be clear about what you intend. The words I intend have tremen dous power. True health would consis t of twelve completely mutated and evolved helixes inside the body, which would activate full brain capacity. It will take a while for the twelve helixes to be completely activated, though they can begin to be plugge d in. Some of you have experien ced them as plugged in, yet not activated. When they are in activ ation, the full brain is in oper ation and you are geniuses. You know everything, you are telepathic, and you are able to do anything becaus e you are the host of the Living Library. You have the card that allo ws you to access any kind of informat ion stored all over this planet. If you could aspire to anything, we would ask you to become impeccable K eepers of Frequency. Keep inside yourself knowledge and inform ation of the highest order, an order of unlimited being. Make that frequency, simply by living it, available to al l around you by walking your streets, shopping in you r stores, and simply resting on your pillows in the even ing and knowing who you are. There will come a time when you wi ll no longer need to seek informat ion outside of yourselves. At this time, we and others like us co me to trigger you, to round you up, to gather you together, and to put you into clusters so that you can refl ect off each other and el ectromagnetically charge each other. When we work with you, we create sparks of light that allow openings. As these openings occur within you, you vibrate at such a rate that you affect everyone around you. Whenever something clicks with one of you, you send out a freque ncy of recognition and other people pick it up. That is how the group mind grows. It occurs without you rati onally understanding it or specifically ha ving a picture or a realization of it b ecause it happens electromagnetically within the body. You create the raising of energy according to how much you are able to handle. Individuals must tri gger themselves into multidimensionality. Pa rt of the self makes a decision and says, \"Alright, I wish to go into this multidimensional experience. What do I want to do?\" The desire must wine first. The desire is a reali zation that puts you in the moment. Then you must decide what you are going to do with this desire. You might forget it tomorrow. In orde r to structure this desire and demonstrate that you are really seri ous about it, participate in events , actions, rituals, and ceremonies that demonstrate your commitment. Th en you can proceed to st ructure your life in such a way as to send the signal that this is what you mean. This can be like living and walking pray er. Churches teach people to pray and beg certain lords for th ings that they want or for forg iveness. We are suggesting a living p rayer, a process by which every moment in the da y has meaning and leads you because of the way you are acting and your focus on what you are praying for. Living prayer involves having a very conscious intention about the objects in your environment: having an altar, having sacred things, and having nothing in your reality that does not have meaning for you. We know that suggesting you have nothing in your reality that has no meaning sends an earthquake through some of you. But how many of you are putti ng up with things you don' t want in your life, whether it is the coat y ou have been wearin g for the last fifteen y ears that has a few moth holes unde r"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"the arm or the partner you have be en carting around for thirty-five year s who has more than a few moth holes? It is a challenge to get rid of everything in your life that does not have meaning for you, yet this is essential. Putting an altar together is a great overlay for acti vating ritual. Ritual stirs up cellular memory and reminds you of ancient teachings th at are stored inside you. It puts these teach ings into your active memory. Ritual puts you in the now and takes you from one expa nding now to another by honoring aspects of Mother Earth that have personal signi ficance. You create personal significance for yourself. All things first come into being because someone de cided to energize them. Anything can be energized. It comes down to the power of the i ndividual mind to activate the will and use it to restructure reality. There is no one on the Earth plane at this time who is not impulsed to ward evolving. No one without this impulse would have come here. All th e portals that were opened and the blueprints that were laid out fo r this time were conditioned to wo rk toward self-motivating, self-a ccelerating, rapid evolution. This boo k itself is a process and a trigger. The keys are hidden within this book. We encourag e you to act on the impulses that are whispering in your ear saying, \"You are part of this Family of Light, and Earth is a Living Library.\" We will entice you and assist you by saying that there are many rewards. Even though we will never guarantee that the challenges will stop, th ere is a stance of mastery that you will achieve. Learn to read the symbols and fo llow the impulses to their highest conclusion. Being multidimensional means opening the channels and turn ing the dials to the various fre quencies, and then receiving the transmissions or knowings. There are not enough words in the pr esent vocabulary or dic tionary of expression to convey the feelings of the nonphysical realm. The Spirit we speak of en compasses many ideas. It ba sically refers to that which is not physical or not wi thin third-dimensional viewing. You can liken this enticement or leap to bounding on a trampoline and going for one gigantic jump, afte r which you never touch the trampoline again. You bound and bound and then go for that gold that sends you into the realm of Spirit. This is not to say that you are lost or de stroyed or that y our molecules are disseminated. It is simply the vaul t that all of the ancient shamans on Earth practiced and maintained as a potentiality a way of linking intelligent form s and assisting the evolving human species. Multidimensionality to us is a way of life. We realiz e that part of our chal lenge as teachers is to transduce our way of life into systems that are evolving. To put you at rest, however, unless you chec k out of the planet, this is a pr ocess you are heading toward, though how you encounter it is up to you. We want you to be able to go to the edge of a cliff, step off it , and stand in the air ne xt to the cliff edge. We want you to be out there. We want you to recognize the heretic inside of you: tile part that knows and is going to break this reality wide ope n and establish a whole new paradi gm of consciousness. This is not going to be done by one world leader; it is going to be done by the masses, beca use the masses are ready for it. At this time, the Guardians of Light are on this pl anet in the millions. Al l you need to do is evolve yourselves. Your work at this time is very intensely involved with the self, the physical vehicle that you p resently occupy. It is the self that allows you to play this game at this time. Love it, honor it, cherish it, take good care of it, speak very well of it, and inte nd that it perform at optimu m capacity. That is all you need do to be open to connect with your Family of Light. Then be prepared to find out who light has met, who light is going to introduc e you to, and who light, indeed, are.

We have decided to come onto this p lanet and operate with light first by informing you, strengtheni ng you, and firing your blueprints according to information. N ow that you have become in formed, and you unde rstand what you are up against during the multidimensional light infusion with your identity, you will begin to experience the love frequency that Will allow you to extend love to other versions of your multidimensional se lf and create a massive healing of consciousness on many leve ls.

You will be in a vibration of connectedness, and everyone and everything you draw to yourse lf will be a part of th at vibration. Anything that does not resonate with this frequency will not even be able to get near you. In actuality, when you resonate with the highe r frequencies, anything that is not in those frequencies will not even see you. When you operate in the frequenc y of information coupled with cr eation and love, you will be put to work spreading that frequency-not by doing it for others, but by allowi ng others to feel your frequency when they come in contact with you. You all are invaluable, you know. Thos e of you who master these things, and there is no reason why all of you cannot, will be in very high demand one of these days. You will be looked upon as superhuman. However, it is not for you to separate yourself from the population. It is your place to teach the p opulation and show them how they can do the same thing. Frequencies are to be given and shared freely so that everyone can discover what they can do for themselves. This is how this planet is going to evolve.

We feel that we have gi ven to this planet at this time a succinct message of inspiration-a message that holds waves of trut h. It is a message to tickle-a message to entice and call fo rward that part of the se lf that has been hidden away and lying dormant. We feel that the material we have be en sharing through this book is to awak en within you what you know. It is to bring you to an understanding of the different versions of your reality's illusion as it is sold to you and to an understanding of what your part in all of this is or can be. We have stimulated each and every one of you with our thought-p rovoking messages. It has been ou r intention to move each one of you and stir you fro m some place, not to ma ke you uncomfortable. You may make yourselves unco mfortable; we en courage you to find comfort. We also encourage you to climb a few- mountain ranges of consciousness within yourself: to go to new- pl aces of comfort and to find those valleys of eternal yout h, eternal vitality, and ongoing expression of creativity. There you will find new vistas of consciousness and a gal actic wave of light from the future. It is our intention in delivering th is final message in chapter 22, the fi nal chapter, to use the vibration o f the number 22, a master num ber. This number is associated wi th imprinting and delivering into this version of physical realit y a master teaching-a message that i nvolves an encoding. The message is not simply in the way the words are strung together: there ar e layers of information hidden within the method and unfoldment of this book. Ideas are presented, conflicts aris e, solutions ar e suggested, and inspiration weaves its way through, turning you always to that final commitment to inspire yourself. We feel that you will benefit from this orchestrati on that we have been influencing behind the scenes. There is a process of understanding th at this book represents . Where it seems that there has been chaos and confusion, and where it seems as if things have been scrambled, that scra mbling has created its own order. This order is being summed up in this final delivery under the stamp of 22. In this final message, we speak into the soul and heart of ever y one of you. We ask you to hear the call, to recognize it, and to step forward as a member of the Family of Light . Have the courage in all the days you walk this planet to live that light and share it with all you encoun ter. This does not mean to preach or sell that light. It means to live the light you know you are, to discover in the simplicity of your being the purpose of your existence, to blo ssom with it, and to reseed this place that is Planet Earth in its deepest time of transition. The process of moving into this higher octave of under standing-th is blending of dimensions an d creation of new territory-will le ad everyone through greater understa nding of death. Your light will be needed. Your light represents what you know. This book has many wa ys, through designs and codes that you have been unable to recognize, to remind you in these final pages that you know everything we speak of and that it is inside of you. It is time for you to share the di scoveries and miracles of operating the physical vehicle in these times of change and tr ansition that involve the death of the world as you know it. When there is a death, there is always a rebirth; something dies and something new is born.

As the days begin to unfold, they will reveal the ancient prophecies as they are coming alive. These ancient prophecies will be much more colorful and have their own versi ons of themselves as they teach this planet its greatest lessons. As you evolve, you carry what you know forward, and you share it a nd live it. You become a greate r vessel or greater expr ession of light.

The abilities and talents and information that will come to you are simply inside of you. We will remind you that there is a ga lactic tidal wave of light from the future coming toward your planet and that this intersection will be felt throughout the masses in the year 1993. It will be as if the entire p lanet has a unilateral raise in consciousness. This wave has to be gigantic to affect all of the masses who are locked in frequency control. It is you, the Family of Light, who are here in the millions making room in your bodies for this galactic tidal wave, who wi ll allow this infusion of the first layer of the light body to be held by all of the masse. The light body is the body th at holds the complete mutation of the species. It will be able to juggle realities through the shifting of cons ciousness by intent from one view to another, like turning the stations on a television. The light body will hold all of this encoded data and be able to translate it at will. It will communicate innerdim ensionally and interdimensionally. Remember, matter is si mply light that is tr apped. As you build your li ght body, you are allowing a reorganization of the molecular stru cture-a loosening of your grip upon a certain aspect of materialism so that your spiritual understanding can be more in tune with your day- to-day life. The building of the light body is the allowing of less trap ped matter to manifest and allow light, which is freer in expression and in seeking its own source, to become who you are so that you are not so solid. As you raise your vibratory rates, you become your light body. You will see the change in your body literally. Your body will become more vital, more youthful, more nourished in its own being, and definitely the processor of a multitude of informati on. It will become a super being. The building of the light body involves beco ming a super being. Extending the longevity of the ce llular body through rejuvenation and extension of cellular life is coming back into fashion. This is part of building the light body-a body that is not so dense, that does not self-destruct, that self-generat es, and that self-replenishes. That is what you are all striving for. You would be your light body, and you would feel it, if your logical mind we re not so worried about whethe r it is possible; society is not telling you it is possible. We cannot emphasize enough to you that you must stop listening to society. Th is is going to be the hardest task for you to do and the biggest break for you to make.
