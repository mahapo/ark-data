I picked up the telegram from m y desk and r ead it a third time. NEW YORK , N. Y., MAY 9, 1949 HAVE BEE N INVE STIGATING FLY ING SAUCER MYSTERY. FIRST T IP HINTED GIGANTIC HOAX T O COVE R UP OFF ICIAL SECRET. BELIEVE IT MAY HAV E BEEN PLANTED TO HIDE REA L ANSWER. LOOKS LIKE TERR IFIC STORY. CAN YOU TAKE OVE R WASHING TON END ? KEN W. PURDY, EDITOR, TRUE MAGAZINE I glanced out at the Potomac, recalling the first saucer story. As a pilot, I'd been skeptical of flying disks . Then reports had begun to pour in from Air Force and airline pilots. App arently alarmed, the Air Force had ordered fighters to pursue the fast-flying saucers. In one mysterious chase, a pilot had been killed, and his death was un explained. That had been seventeen months ago. Since then, the whole flying-saucer r idd le had been hidd en behind a curtain of Air Force secrecy. And now, an assignment from True magazine o n flying saucers. Twenty-four hours later, I was in Ken Purdy's office. “I’ve had men on this f or two months,” he told me. “I might as well warn you, it's a tough story to crack.” “You think it's a Russian missile?” I asked him. “Or an Air Force secret?” “We've had several answers. None o f them stacks up. But I'm positive o ne was deliberately planted when they foun d we were checking.” He told me the whole story of the work that had been done by the staff of True and of the reports s ent in by competent writers. The deeper he delved into the mystery, the tougher the assignment got. The more I learned about flying saucers, the less I knew. “There's one angle I want rechecked,” Purdy said. “You've heard of the Mantell case?” I nodd ed. “O.K. Try to get the details of Mantell's radio report to Godman Tower. Before he was killed, he described the thing he was chasing — we know that m uch. Project ‘Saucer’ gave o ut a hint, but t hey've never r eleased the transcript. Here's another lead. See if"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"you can find anything ab out a secret picture, taken at Harmon Field, Newfoun dland — it was around July 1947 . I'll send you other ideas as I g et them.” Before I left, Purdy wished me hick and told me that he would work in closest harmony with me. “But watch out for fake tips, ́ he said. “You'll probably run into some people at t he Pentagon who'll talk to you ‘off the record.’ That handcuffs a writer. Look out t hey don't lead you into a blind alley. Even the Air Force statements and the Project 'Saucer' r eport contradict each other.” For six months, I worked with other investigators to solve the mystery of the disks . We checked a hun dred sighting reports, frequently crossing the trail of Project \"Saucer\" teams and F.B.I. agents. O ld r ecords gave fantastic leads. So did Air Force plans f or exploring space. Rocket experts, astronomers, Air Force o fficials and p ilot gave us clues pointing to a startling solution. Many intelligent persons — including scientists — believe that the saucers contain spies from another p lanet. Wh en this f irst phase was ended, w e were faced with a hard d ecision. We had un covered important facts, We knew the saucers were real. If it was handled carefully, we believed the story would be in line with a secret Air Force policy. It was f inally decided to publish certain alternate conclusions. The Air Force was informed of True's intentions; no attempt was made to block publication. In the Ja nu ary 19 50 issue o f True, I reported that we had r eached the following conclusions: 1. The e arth h as been observed p eriodically by v isitors from another p lanet. 2. This observation has increased markedly in the past two years. “The o nly other p ossible e xplanation,” I wrote, “is that, the saucers are e xtremely high-speed, long-range devices developed here o n earth. Such an advance (which the Air Force has denied) would require an almost incredible leap in technical progress even for American scientists and d esigners.” Nation-wide press and r adio comm ent followed the app earance o f the article. This publicity was obviously g reater than the Air Force had expected. Within twenty-four hours the Pentagon was deluged with telegrams, letters, and long-distance calls. App arently fearing a panic, the Air Force hastily stated that flying-saucer reports — even those made by its own pilots and high-ranking officers — were mistakes or were caused by hysteria. 1 But t hree days later, w hen it was plain that m any Americans calmly accepted True's disclosures, the Air Force released a secret project “ Saucer ” file containing this significant statement: “It will never be possible to say with certainty that any individual did not see a space"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"ship, an enemy missile o r other object.” In this s ame document there app ears a confidential analysis of Air intelligence reports. 2 It is this summ ary that contains the o fficial suggestion Of. space visitors' motives. After stating that such a civilization would obviously be far ahead of our own, the report add s: “Since the acts of mankind most easily observed from a distance are A-bomb explosions, w e should expect some relation to o btain between the time o f the A-bomb explosions, the time at which the space ships are seen, and the time required for such ships to arrive from and r eturn to home ba se.” (In a previous report, w hich alternately warned and r eassured the public, the Air Force stated that space travel outside the solar system is almost a certainty. 3 ) Since 1949 there has been a steady increase in saucer sightings. Most of them have been authentic r eports, w hich Air Force denials cannot disprove. In Ja nuary, mystery disks were reported over Kentucky, Indiana, Texas, Pennsylvania, and several other states. O n the Seattle Anchorage route, an air freighter was paced for five minu tes by a night-flying saucer. Wh en the pilots tried to close in, the strange craft zoomed at terrific speed. Later, the airline head r eported that Intelligence o fficers had quizzed the pilots for hours. “From their questions,” he said, “I could tell they had a good idea of what the saucers are. O ne o fficer admitted they did, but he wouldn't say any more.” Another p eculiar incident occurred at Tucson, Arizona, on February 1. Just at dusk, a weird, fiery object raced westward over the city, astonishing hu ndreds in the streets below. The Tucson Daily Citizen ran the story next day with a double-bann er headline: “FL YING SAUCER OVE R TUCSON?” “B-29 FAILS TO CA TCH OBJEC T” Flying saucer? Se cret experimental plane? Or perhaps a scout craft from Mars? Certainly the strange aircraft that blazed a smoke trail over Tucson at dusk last night defies logical explanation. It was as mystifying to e xperienced p ilots as to groun dlings who have trouble in identifying conventional planes. Cann onba lling through the sky, some 30,000 feet aloft, w as a fiery object shooting westward so fast it was impossible to gain any clear impression of its shape o r size. . . . At what must have been top speed the o bject spewed out light coloured smoke, but almost directly over Tucson it app eared to hover for a few seconds. The smoke puffed out an angry black and then be came lighter as the strange missile appeared to gain speed\""},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The radio o perator in the Davis-Monthan air force ba se control tower c ontacted First Lt. Roy L . Jones, taking off f or a cross- coun try flight in a B-29 , and asked him to investigate. Jones revved up his swift aerial tanker and still the un known aircraft steadily pulled away toward California. Dr. Edwin F. Carpenter, head of the University of Arizona departm ent of astronomy, said he was certain that the o bject was not a meteor or other natural phenomenon. . . . “Switchboards Swamped” — S witchboards at t he Pima coun ty sheriff's office and Tucson police station were jammed with inquiries.

[A later c heck showed no planes missing.] H e said it wavered from left to right as it passed over the moun tains. Bailey also noticed that t he craft app eared to slow perceptibly over Tucson. He said the smoke app arently came o ut in a thin, almost invisible stream, gaining substance within a few seconds. This incident had an odd sequel the following day. Its s ignificance was not lost on the Daily Citizen. It ran another front-page story, headlined: “WHAT DO YOU MEA N ONLY VA POR TRAIL?” As though to prove itself blameless f or tilting hun dreds of Tucson h eads sk yward, the U.S. Air Force yesterday afternoon spent hours etching v apour trails through the skies over the city. The demonstration proved c onclusively to the satisfaction of most t hat t he strange path of dark s moke blazed across the e vening sky at dusk Wednesday was no vapour trail and d id not emanate from any conventional airplane. The Wednesday night spectacle was entirely dissimilar. Then, heavy smoke boiled and swirled in a b road, dark ribbon fann ing out at least a mile in width and stretching across the sky in a straight line. Since there was no proof as to what caused the strange predark manifestation, and because e ven expert witnesses were un ab le to explain the app earance, the matter r emains a subject for interesting speculation. There is s trong evidence that this s tory was deliberately kept off the press wires. The Associated Press and other wire services in W ashington h ad no report. Requests f or details by F rank Edwards, Mutual newscaster, and other r adio commentators ran into a b lank wall. At t he Pentagon I was told that t he Air Force had no knowledge o f the sighting or the vapour-trail manoeuvers. On February 22 two similar glowing objects were seen above Boca Chica Naval Air Station at Key West. A plane sent t ip to investigate was hopelessly outdistanced; it was obvious the things were at a great height. Back at the station, radarmen tracked the o bjects as they hovered for a moment ab ove Key West. They were found to be at least fifty miles ab ove the e arth. After a few seconds, they accelerated at high speed and streaked out of sight. On the following day Comm ander Augusto Orrego, a Chilean n aval officer, reported"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"that saucers had flown ab ove his antarctic base. “During the bright antarctic night,” be said, “we saw flying saucers, one ab ove the other, turning at tremendous s peeds. We have photographs to prove what we saw.” Early in March, K en Purdy phoned the latest development in the investigation. He had just received a tip p redicting a flurry of saucer p ublicity during March. It had come from an important source in W ashington. “You know w hat it probab ly means,” he said. “The same thing we talked ab out last month. But why were we tipp ed off in advance?” “It's one more piece in the pattern,\" I said. \"If the tip's on the level, then they're stepp ing up the program.” Within three days, reports began to pour in — from Peru, Cuba , Mexico, Turkey, and other p arts of the world. Then on March 9 a gleaming metallic d isk was s ighted over Dayton, O hio. O bservers at Vandalia Airport phoned Wright-Patterson Field. Scores of Air Force pilots and groundmen watched the disk, as fighters raced up in pursuit. The mysterious object streaked vertically skyward, hovered for a while miles ab ove the earth, and then disapp eared. A secret report was rushed to the Civil Aeronautics Authority in Washington, then turned over to Air Force Intelligence. Soo n after this Dr. Craig Hun ter, director of a medical supp ly firm, reported a hu ge elliptical saucer flying at a low altitude in Pennsylvania. He described it as metallic, with a slotted outer r im and a rotating ring just inside. On top of this s ighting, thousands of people at Farmington, New Mexico, w atched a large formation of disks pass high ab ove the city. Throughout all these reports, the Air Force refused to admit the e xistence o f flying saucers. O n March 18 it flatly denied they were Air Force secret m issiles or space-exploration devices. Three days later, a Chicago and So uthern airliner cr ew saw a fast-flying disk near Stuttgart, Arkansas. The circular cr aft, blinking a strange blue-white light, pulled up in an arc at terrific speed. The two pilots s aid they g limpsed lighted p orts on the lower side as the saucer zoomed ab ove them. The lights had a soft fluorescence, unlike anything they had seen. There was one peculiar angle in the Arkansas incident. There was no app arent attempt to muzzle the two pilots, as in earlier airline cases. Instead, a United Press interview was quickly arranged, for nation-wide publication. In this wire story Captain Ja ck Adams and First Officer G. W. Anderson made two statements: “We firmly believe that t he flying saucer we saw over Arkansas was a secret experimental type aircr aft — not a visitor from outer space. . . . ” “We know the Air Force has denied there is anything to this flying-saucer business, but we're both experienced p ilots and we're not easily fooled.”"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The day after this s tory app eared, I was discussing it with an airline o fficial i n Washington. “That's an odd thing,\" he said. \"The Air Force could have persuaded those pilots — or the line president — to hush the thing up.

Wh y was McLaughlin, a regular Navy officer subject t o security screening, permitted to give o ut t his s tory? Was it an incredible slip-up? Or was it part of some carefully thought-out plan?

For almost a year I have watched the behind-the-scenes manoeuvers of those who guide this program. In the following chapters I have tried to show the strange developments in our search for the answer; the carefully misleading tips, the blind alleys we e ntered, the un expected assistance, the confidential leads, and the stunn ing contradictions.

Mantell died mysteriously in the skies s outh of Fort Knox. But before his radio went silent, he sent a strange message to Godman Air Force Base. The men who heard it will never forget it. It was Ja nu ary 7, 1948 . Crowded into the Godman Field Tower, a group of Air Force o fficers stared up at t he afternoon sky. For just an instant, something gleamed through the broken clouds s outh of the ba se. High above the field, three P-51 fighters climbed with swift urgency. Heading south, they quickly v anished. The clock in the tower r ead 2:45 . Colonel Guy Hix, the C.O., slowly put down h is binoculars. If the thing was still there, the clouds now hid it. All they could d o was wait. The first alarm had c ome from Fort Knox, w hen Army M.P.'s had r elayed a state police warning. A hu ge gleaming object had been seen in the sky, moving toward Godman Field. Hun dreds of s tartled p eople had seen it at Madisonville, ninety miles away. Thirty minutes later, it had zoomed up over the ba se. Colonel Hix glanced around at the rest of the men in the tower. They all had a dazed look. Every man there had seen the thing, as it ba rreled south of the field. Even through the thin clouds, its intermittent red glow had hinted at some mysterious s ource o f power. So mething outside their un derstanding. It was Woods, the e xec, w ho had estimated its s ize. Hix shook his head. That was unbelievable. But something had hun g over Godman Field for almost an hour.

No o ne spoke. \"The thing's starting to climb,\" Mantell said swiftly. \"It's at twelve o 'clock high, making half my speed. I'll try to close in.\" In five minutes, Mantell reported again. The strange metallic object had speeded up, w as now making 360 or more. At 3:08, Mantell's wingman called in. Both h e and the o ther p ilot had seen the weird object. But Mantell had out-climbed them and was lost in the clouds. Se ven minu tes dragged by. The men in the tower sweated out t he silence. Then, at 3:15 , Mantell made a hasty contact. \"It's s till ab ove me, making my speed or better. I'm going up to twenty thousand feet. If I'm no closer, I'll aba ndon chase.\" It was his last report. Minu tes later, his fighter d isintegrated with terrific force. The falling wreckage was s cattered for thousands of feet. Wh en Mantell failed to answer the tower, one o f his pilots began a search. Climbing to 33 ,00 0 feet, he flew a hun dred miles to the south. But the thing that lured M antell to his death had vanished from t he sky. Ten days after Mantell was k illed, I learned of a curious s equel to the Godman affair.

Colonel Hix was quoted as having watched the o bject, which was still un identified. But there was no mention of Mantell's radio messages — no hint of the thing's tremendous size.

Wh en I called the Pentagon, they admitted this much, and that was all. In the next few months, other flying-disk stories hit t he front pages. Two Eastern Airline pilots reported a double-decked mystery ship sighted near Montgomery, Alab ama. I learned of two o ther sightings, one o ver the Pacific Ocean and one in California. The second one, seen through field glasses, w as described as rocket-shaped, as large as a B-29 . There were also rumours of disks being tracked by radar, but it was almost a year before I confirmed these reports. Wh en Purdy wired me, early in May of '49, I had half forgotten the disks .

Then h e said ab ruptly: \"You know anything about the disks ?\" \"If you mean what they are — no.\" He motioned for me to sit down.

Purdy shrugged. \"They deny it was Venus in this report. But that's what they told Shallett — that all those Air Force o fficers, the pilots, the Kentucky state police, and several hun dred p eople at Madisonville mistook Venus for a metallic disk several hun dred feet in diameter.\" \"It's a wonder Shallett believed it.\" \"I don't think he did.

It quoted M antell's radio report t hat t he thing was metallic and tremendous in size. Linked with the death of Mantell was the Lockbourne, O hio, report, w hich tied in with what Ja ck Daly had told me, over a year before. I read the report: \"On the same day, about two hours later, a sky phenomenon was observed by several watchers over Lockbourne Air Force Base, Columbus, Ohio.

Mantell died mysteriously in the skies s outh of Fort Knox. But before his radio went silent, he sent a strange message to Godman Air Force Base. The men who heard it will never forget it. It was Ja nu ary 7, 1948 . Crowded into the Godman Field Tower, a group of Air Force o fficers stared up at t he afternoon sky. For just an instant, something g leamed through the broken clouds south of the ba se. High above the field, three P-51 fighters climbed with swift urgency. Heading south, they quickly vanished. The clock in the tower r ead 2:45 . Colonel Guy Hix, the C.O., slowly put down his binoculars. If the thing was s till there, the clouds now hid it. All they could d o was wait. The first alarm had c ome from Fort Knox, w hen Army M.P.'s had r elayed a state police warning. A hu ge gleaming object had been seen in the sky, moving toward Godman Field. Hundreds of s tartled p eople had seen it at Madisonville, ninety miles away. Thirty minutes later, it had zoomed up over the ba se. Colonel Hix g lanced around at t he rest of the men in the tower. They all had a dazed look. Every man there had seen the thing, as it ba rreled south of the field. Even through the thin clouds, its intermittent red glow had hinted at some mysterious source o f power. So mething outside their un derstanding. It was Woods, the e xec, w ho had estimated its size. Hix shook his head. That was un believab le. But something had hun g over Godman Field for almost an h our. The C.O. turned quickly as the loud-speaker, tuned to the P-51 's, sudd enly came to life. “Captain Mantell to Godman . . . Tower Mantell to Godman Tower . . .” The flight leader's voice had a strained tone. “I’ve sighted the thing!\" he said. “It looks metallic— and it's tremendous in size!” The C.O. and Woods s tared at each other. No o ne spoke. “The thing's s tarting to climb,” Mantell said swiftly. “It's at t welve o 'clock high, making half my speed. I'll try to close in.”"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"In five minutes, Mantell reported again. The strange metallic object had speeded up, was now making 360 or more. At 3:08, Mantell's wingman called in. Both h e and the o ther p ilot had seen the weird object. But Mantell had out-climbed them and was lost in the clouds. Se ven minu tes dragged by. The men in the tower sweated out t he silence. Then, at 3:15, Mantell made a hasty contact. “It's s till ab ove me, making my speed or better. I'm going up to twenty thousand feet. If I'm no closer, I'll aba ndon chase.” It was his last report. Minu tes later, his f ighter d isintegrated with terrific force. The falling wreckage was scattered for thousands of feet. Wh en Mantell failed to answer the tower, one o f his pilots began a search. Climbing to 33 ,000 feet, he flew a hun dred miles to the south. But the thing that lured M antell to his death had vanished from t he sky. Ten days after M antell was killed, I learned of a curious s equel to the Godman affair. An A.P. accoun t in the New York Times had caught m y attention. The story, released at Fort Knox, admitted M antell had d ied while chasing a flying saucer. Colonel Hix was quoted as having watched the o bject, w hich was s till unidentified. But t here was no mention of Mantell's radio messages— no hint of the thing's tremendous size. Though I knew the lid was probab ly on, I went to the Pentagon. Wh en the scare had first broken, in the summer of ’47, I had talked with Captain Tom Brown, who was handling saucer inquiries. But by now Brown h ad been shifted, and no o ne in the Press Branch would admit knowing the details of the Mantell saucer c hase. “We just don't know the answer,” a security officer told me. “There's a rumour,” I said, “it’s a secret Air Force missile that sometimes goes out of control.” “Good God, man!” he e xploded. “If it was, do you think we'd be o rdering pilots to chase the damned things?” “No — and I didn't say I believed it.” I waited un til he cooled d own. “This order you mentioned — is it for all Air Force pilots, or special fighter un its?” “I didn't say it was a special order,” he answered quickly. “All pilots have routine instructions to report unu sual items.”"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"“They had fighters alerted on the Coast, w hen the scare first broke,” I reminded him. \"Are those o rders still in force?” He shook his head. “No, not t hat I know of.” After a moment he added, “All I can tell you is that the Air Force is s till i nvestigating. We honestly don't know the answer.” As I went out the Mall entrance, I ran into Jack Daly, one o f Washington's veteran newsmen. Before the war, Ja ck and I had done magazine pieces together, usually on Axis espionage and c ommunist activity. I told him I was trying to find the answer to Mantell's death. “You h eard anything?” I asked him. “Only what was in the A.P. story,” said Ja ck. “But an I.N.S. man told me they had a saucer story from Columbus, O hio — and it might have been the same o ne they saw at Fort Knox.” “I missed that. What was it?” “They sighted the thing at t he Air Force field outside o f Columbus. It was aroun d sun down, ab out two hours after that pilot was k illed in Kentucky.” “Anybody chase it?” I asked. “No. They didn't have time to take o ff, I guess. This I.N.S. guy said it was going like hell. Fast as a j et, anyway.” “Did he say what it looked like?” “The Air Force boys s aid it was as big as a C-47,” said Ja ck. “Maybe bigger. It had a redd ish-orange e xhaust streaming out behind. They could see it for miles.” “If you h ear any more, let m e know,” I said. Ja ck promised he would. “Wh at do you think they are?” he asked me. “It's got m e stumped. Russia wouldn't be testing missiles over here. Anyway, I can't believe they've got anything like that. And I can't see the Air Force letting pilots get killed to hide something we've got.” One week later, I heard that a top-secret un it had been set up at Wright Field to investigate all saucer reports. Wh en I called the Pentagon, they admitted this much, and that was all. In the next few months, other flying-disk stories hit t he front pages. Two Eastern Airline pilots reported a double-decked mystery ship sighted near M ontgomery, Alaba ma. I learned of two o ther sightings, one o ver the Pacific Ocean and one in California.

Wh en Purdy wired me, early in May of '49 , I had half forgotten the disks . It had been months s ince any important sightings had been reported. But his message quickly revived my curiosity. If he thought the subject was hot, I knew he must have reasons. Wh en I walked into his office at 67 West 44th, Purdy stubb ed out his cigarette and shook hands. He looked at m e through h is glasses f or a moment. Then h e said ab ruptly: “You know anything about the disks ?” “If you mean what they are — no.” He motioned for me to sit down. Then he swiveled his chair aroun d, his s houlders hun ched forward, and frowned out the window. “Have you seen the Post this week?” I told him no. “There's s omething damned queer going on. For fifteen months, Project ‘Saucer’ is buttoned up tight. Top secret. Then sudd enly, Forrestal gets the S aturday Evening Post to run two articles, brushing the whole thing off. The first piece hits the stands — and then what happ ens?” Purdy swun g around, jabb ed his finger at a document on. his desk. “That same day, the Air Force rushes out this Project ‘Saucer’ r eport. It admits they haven't identified the disks in any important cases. They say it's s till serious enough — wait a minute — “he thumbed through the stapled p apers—” ‘to require constant vigilance by P roject \"Saucer\" personnel and the civilian population.’” “You'd think the Post would make a public kick,” I said. “I don't m ean it's an out-and-out denial,\" said Purdy. \"It doesn't m ention the Post — just contradicts it. In fact, the report contradicts itself. It looks as if they're trying to warn people and yet they're scared to say too much.” I looked at the title o n the report: “A Digest of Preliminary Studies by the Air M ateriel Comm and, Wright Field, D ayton, O hio, on ‘Flying Saucers’” “Have the papers caught it yet?” I asked Purdy. “You mean its contradicting the Post?” He shook his head. “No, the Pentagon press release didn't get m uch space. How many editors would wade through a six-thousand-word government report? Even if they did, they'd have to compare it, item for item, w ith the Post piece.” “Wh o wrote the Post story?”"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Purdy lit a cigarette and frowned out again at the skyscrapers. “Sidney Shallett — and he's careful.

'd his s cript, which practically says the saucers are bun k. Then they reneged on it.” “Maybe some top brass s udd enly decided it was the wrong policy to brush it off,” I suggested. “Wh y the quick change?” demanded Purdy. “Let's say they sold the Post on covering up the truth, in the interests of security. It's possible, though I don't believe it. O r they could simply have fed them a fake story. Either way, w hy did they rush this contradiction the minute the Post hit the stands?” “So mething serious happ ened,” I said, “after the Post went to press.” “Yes, but what?” Purdy said impatiently. “That's what we've got to find out.” “Does Shallett's first piece mention Mantell's death?” “Explains it perfectly. You know w hat Mantell was chasing? The planet Venu s!” “That's the Post's answer?” I said, incredulously. “It’s what t he Air Force contract astronomer told Shallett. I've checked with two astronomers here. They say that even when Venus is at full magnitude you can ba rely see it in the daytime e ven when you're looking for it. It was only half magnitude that day, so it was practically invisible.” “How'd the Air Force e xpect anybody to believe that answer?” I said. Purdy shrugged. “They deny it was Venus in this report. But t hat's what they told Shallett — that all those Air Force o fficers, the pilots, the Kentucky state police, and several hun dred people at Madisonville mistook Venu s f or a metallic disk several hun dred feet in diameter.” “It’s a wonder Shallett believed it.” “I don't think he did. He says if it wasn't Venu s, it must have been a ba lloon.” “Wh at's the Air Force answer?” I asked Purdy. “Look in the report. They say whatever Mantell chased — they call i t a 'mysterious object' — is s till un identified.” I glanced through the case report, on page five.

They’ll swear it isn't haunted— but they won't go near it.” Later, I asked a security major for a copy of the Project “Saucer” report. “We’re o ut of copies right now,” he said. “I’ll send you one next week.” I asked him bluntly what he thought the saucers were. “I doubt if anybody has the full answer,” he said seriously. “There’s been some hysteria— also a few mistakes. But m any reports have been made by reliab le pilots, including our own. You can't laugh those o ff.” As I drove home, I thought over what I’d heard. All I had learned was that t he Air Force seemed d ivided. But t hat could be a smoke screen. In less than twenty–four hours, I received my first suspicious tip. It was ab out ten A.M. w hen my phone rang. “Mr. Keyhoe? This is John Steele,” said the voice at t he o ther end. (Because o f the peculiar r ole he played, then and later, I have not used his real name.) “I’m a former Air Force Intelligence o fficer. I was in the European theater d uring the war.” I waited. He hesitated a moment. “I heard you're working on the flying-saucer pr oblem,” he said quickly. “I may have some information that would interest you.” “Mind telling me who told you I was on it?” I asked. “No o ne, directly. I just happ ened to hear it mentioned at the Press Club. Frankly, I’ve been curious ab out the flying saucers ever since ’45.” That startled me, but I didn't tell him so. “Do you h ave any idea what they are?” Mr. Steele said."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"“No, I've just begun checking. But I'd be glad to hear what you've got.” “I may be way off,” said Steele. “But I’ve always wondered ab out the ‘foo fighters’ our pilots s aw over Europe near the e nd of the war.” I thought for a second. “Wasn’t that some kind of antiaircraft m issile fired from t he groun d?” “No. Intelligence never d id get any real answer, so far as I know. They were some kind of circular gadgets, and they actually chased our planes a nu mber of times. We thought they were something the Nazis had invented— and I still think s o.” “Then who's laun ching them now?” “Well, it’s obviously either Russia or us. If it is the So viet— well, that’s what’s worried me. I don't think it should be treated like a joke, the way some people in the Pentagon take it.” I stared at the phone, trying to figure him out. “I’d like to talk it over with you,\" I said. \"Maybe you've got something.\" \"I've given you about all I know,” Steele answered. “There was an Intelligence report you might try to see— the Eighth Air Force files s hould have it.” “Wait a minu te,” I said. “Give me your number, in case I find anything.” He gave it to me without app arent hesitation. I thanked him and hun g up, still wondering. If it was an attempt at a plant, it was certainly crude. The mention of his f ormer Air Force conn ection would be e nough to arouse suspicion, un less he coun ted on his app arent frankness to o ffs et it. And what ab out the Press Club a ngle? That would indicate S teele was a newspaperman. Could this be merely an attempt to pump me and get a lead on True’s investigation? But t hat would be just as crude as the o ther idea. O f course, he might be sincere. But regardless of his motives, it looked ba d. Arid who had told him ab out me? I thought about that for a minu te. Then I picked up the phone and d ialled Jack Daly’s nu mber. “Ja ck, do you know anyone named John Steele?” I asked him. “I think he’s a newspaperman.” “Nobody I know,” said Jack. “Why, w hat’s up?” I explained, and add ed, “I thought m aybe you knew him, and he'd heard ab out it from"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"you.” “Hell, no,” said Jack. “You ought to know I wouldn't leak any tip like that.” “It wouldn't be a tip— I don't know anything about t his deal yet. By the way, w hen you were o n the S tar d id you h andle anything on ‘foo fighters’?” “No, that was after I left there. Bill Shippen would have covered that, anyway.” I told him I would look it up in the S tar’s morgue. Jack said he would meet m e there at three o 'clock; in the meantime he would see what he could find out ab out Steele. Ja ck was a little late, and I went over the S tar's f ile o n the foo fighters. Most of the facts were covered in a story dated July 6, 194 7, w hich h ad been inspired by the outbreak of the saucer scare. I copied it for later use: During the latter part of World War Two, fighter p ilots in England were convinced that Hitler had a new secret weapon. Yanks dubb ed these devices “foo fighters” or “Kraut fireba lls.” One o f the Air Force Intelligence men n ow assigned to check on the saucer scare was an officer who investigated statements of military airmen that circular foo fighters were seen over Europe and also o n the bombing route to Ja pan. It was reported that Intelligence o fficers have never obtained satisfactory explanation of reports of flying silver balls and disks over Nazi-occupied Europe in the winter of 194 4-45 . Later, crews of B-29 ’S o n bombing run s to Ja pan reported seeing somewhat similar objects. In Europe, some foo fighters danced just off the Allied fighters’ wingtips and p layed tag with them in power d ives. O thers app eared in precise formations and on one occasion a whole bomber c rew saw ab out 15 following at a distance, their strange glow flashing on and off. O ne foo fighter c hased Lieutenant Meiers of Chicago some 20 miles down the Rhine Valley, at 300 m.p.h., an A.P. w ar c orrespondent reported. Intelligence o fficers believed at t hat t ime that t he balls might be radar-controlled objects s ent up to foul ignition systems or baffle Allied radar networks. There is no e xplanation of their app earance here, unless the o bjects could have been imported for secret tests in this country. I read the last paragraph twice. This looked like a strong lead to the answer, in spite of the Air Force denials. There was another, less pleasant possibility. The Russians could have seized the device and developed it secretly, using Nazi scientists to help them. Perhaps the Nazis had been close to an atomic engine, even if they did fail to produce the bomb. Ja ck Daly came in while I was reading the story again. “I g ot the dope o n Steele,” he said. “He does pieces for a small syndicate, and I foun d"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"out he was in the Air Force. I think he was a captain. People who know him say he’s O.K. — a straight shooter.” “That still wouldn't keep him from giving me a fake tip, if s omebody told him it was the right thing to do.” “Maybe not,” said Ja ck, “but why would they want to plant this foo-fighter idea?” I showed him the clipp ing. He read it over and shook his head. “That's a lot different from disks three hun dred feet in diameter.” “If we got the principle— o r Russia did-building big ones might not be too hard.” “I still can't swallow it,” said Jack. “These things have been seen all over the world. How could they control them t hat far away— and be sure they wouldn't crash, w here somebody could get a look and d ope o ut the secret?” We argued it ba ck and forth without getting anywhere. “I’d give a lot to know Steele’s angle,” I said. “If you h ear anything more o n h im, give me a b uzz.” Ja ck nodd ed. “I’ll see what I can do.

The next day I decided to analyse the Mantell case from beginn ing to e nd. It looked like the key to o ne angle: the question of an Air Force secret m issile. Unless there was some slip-up, so that Mantell and his pilots had been ordered to chase the disk by mistake, then it would be cold murder. I couldn't believe any Air Force o fficer would give such an order, no matter how tremendous the secret to be hidd en. But I was going to find out, if possible. ~"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"CHAPTER V FOR MORE than two weeks, I checked on the Godman Field tragedy. O ne fact stood out at the start: The death of Mantell had had a profoun d effect on many in the Air Force. A dozen times I was told: \"I thought t he saucers were a j oke-un til Mantell was k illed c hasing that thing at Fort Knox.\" Many ranking officers who had laughed at the saucer scare stopp ed scoffing. One o f these was General So ry Smith, now D eputy Director of Air Force Public Relations. Later in my investigation, G eneral Smith told me: \"It was the Mantell case that got m e. I knew Tomm y Mantell. very well — also Colonel Hix, the C.O. at Godman. I knew they were both intelligent men — not the kind to be imagining things.\" For fifteen months, the Air Force kept a tight-lipp ed silence. Meantime, rumours began to spread. O ne report said that Mantell had been shot, his body riddled with bullets; his P-51 , also ridd led, had simply disintegrated. Another rumour reported M antell as having been killed by some mysterious force; this s ame force had also destroyed his f ighter. The Air Force, the rumours s aid, had c overed up the truth by telling Mantell's family he had blacked out from lack of oxygen. Checking the last angle, I foun d that t his was the e xplanation given to Mantell's mother, just after his death, she was told by Standiford Field officers that he had flown too high in chasing the strange o bject. Shallet, in the Saturday Evening Post articles, described Project \"Saucer's\" reconstruction of the case. Mantell was s aid to have climbed up to 25 ,000 feet, despite his f irm decision to e nd the chase at 20 ,000 , since he carried no oxygen. Aroun d 25 ,000 feet, Shallett quoted the Air Force investigators, Mantell must have lost consciousness. After this, his pilotless plane climbed on u p to some 30 ,000 feet, then dived. Between 20 ,000 a nd 10 ,000 feet, Shallett suggested, the P-51 b egan to disintegrate, obviously from excessive speed. The gleaming object that hypnotized Mantell i nto this fatal climb was, Shallett said, either the planet Venus or a Navy cosmic-ray research balloon. The Air Force Project \"Saucer\" report of April 27 , 194 9, released just after the first Post article, makes these statements:"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"\"Five minutes after Mantell disapp eared from his f ormation, the two remaining planes returned to Godman. A few minu tes later, one resumed the search, covering territory 100 miles to the south as high as 33 ,00 0 feet, but foun d nothing. \"Subsequent investigation revealed that Mantell had p robab ly blacked out at 20 ,000 feet from lack of oxygen and had d ied of suffocation before the crash. \"The mysterious object which the flyer c hased to his death was first identified as the Planet Venu s. However, further probing showed the e levation and azimuth readings of Venu s and the o bject at specified time intervals did not coincide. \"It is s till considered 'Unidentified.' The Venu s explanation, even though n ow denied, puzz led me. It was plain that the Air Force had seriously considered offering it as the answer then aba ndoned it. App arently someone had got his s ignals mixed and let Shallett use the discarded answer. And for some un known reason, the Air Force had foun d it imperative to deny the Venus s tory at once. In these first weeks of checking, I had r un onto the Venus explanation in other c ases. Se veral Air Force o fficers repeated it so quickly that it had the soun d of a stock alibi. But in the daytime cases this was almost ridiculous. I knew of a few instances in W orld War II when bomber c rews and antiaircr aft gunners had loosed a few bursts at Venus. But this was mostly at night, w hen the planet was at peak brilliance. And more than one gunn er later admitted firing to relieve long hours of boredom. Since e nemy planes did not carry lights, there was no authentic case, to my knowledge, w here plane o r groun d gunn ers actually believed Venus was an enemy aircraft. Checking the astronomer's report, I read over the concluding statement: \"It simply could not have been Venu s. They must have been desperate e ven to suggest it in the first place.\" Months later, in the secret Project \"Saucer\" report released December 30 , 1949 , I foun d official confirmation of this astronomer's opinions. Since it has a peculiar bearing on the Mantell case, I am quoting it now: Wh en Venus is at its greatest brilli ance, it is possible to see it during daytime when one knows exactly where to look. But on Ja nu ary 7, 1948 , Venus was less than half as bright as its peak brilli ance. However, un der exceptionally good atm ospheric c onditions, and with the e ye shielded from direct rays of"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"the sun, Venu s might be seen as an exceedingly tiny bright point of light. . . . However, the chances of looking at just the right spot are very few. It has been un officially reported that the o bject was a Navy cosmic-ray research balloon. If this can be e stab lished, it Is to be preferred as an explanation. However, if one accepts the assumption that reports f rom various other localities refer to the same o bject, any such device must have been a good many miles high — 25 to 50 — in order to have been seen clearly, almost simultaneously, from places 175 miles apart. If all reports were o f a single o bject, in the knowledge o f this investigator no man-made o bject could have been large e nough and far enough away for the appr oximate simultaneous s ightings. It is most un likely, however, that so many separated p ersons s hould at t hat time have chanced on Venus in the daylight sky. It seems therefore much more probab le that m ore than one object was involved. The sighting might have included two o r more ba lloons ( or aircraft) or they might have included Venu s and ba lloons. For r easons given ab ove, the latter explanation seems more likely. Two things s tand out in h is report: 1. The o bvious determination to fit some e xplanation, no matter how farfetched, to the Mantell sighting. 2. The impossibility that Venu s — a tiny point of light, seen only with difficulty — was the tremendous metallic object described by Mantell and seen by Godman Field officers. With Venu s eliminated, I went to work on the ba lloon theory. Since I had been a ba lloon pilot before learning to fly planes, this was fairly familiar groun d. Shallett's alternate theory that Mantell had c hased a Navy research ba lloon was widely repeated by readers unfamiliar with ba lloon operation. Few thought to check the speeds, heights, and d istances involved. Cosmic-ray research balloons are not powered; they are set free to drift with the wind. This particular Navy type is released at a ba se near M inn eapolis. The gas bag is f illed with only a small per c ent of its helium capacity before the take-off. In a routine flight, the balloon ascends rapidly to a very high altitude-as high"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"as 100 ,00 0 feet. By this time the gas ba g has s welled to full size, about l00 feet high and 70 feet in diameter. At a set time, a device releases the case o f instruments un der the ba lloon. The instruments descend by parachute, and the ba lloon, rising quickly, explodes from t he sudd en expansion. Occasionally a ba lloon starts leaking, and it then remains relatively low. At first glance, this might seem t he answer to the Kentucky sightings. If the ba lloon were low enough, it would loom up as a large circular object, as s een from directly below. So me witnesses might estimate its diameter as 250 feet or more, instead of its actual 70 feet. But this failure to recognize a ba lloon would r equire incredibly poor vision on the part of trained observers — state police, Army M.P.'s, the Godman Field officers, Mantell and his pilots. Captain Mantell was a wartime pilot, w ith over three thousand hours in the air. He was trained to identify a distant enemy plane in a split second. His vision was perfect, and so was that of his pilots. In broad daylight they could not fail to recognize a ba lloon during their thirty-minu te chase. Colonel Hix and the o ther Godman officers watched the o bject with high-powered glasses f or long periods. It is incredible that t hey would not identify it as a b alloon. Before its appearance o ver Godman Field, the leaking ba lloon would have drifted, at a low altitude, over several hu ndred miles. (A leak large e nough to bring it down from high altitude would have caused it to land and be found.) Drifting at a low altitude, it would have been seen by several hundred thousand p eople, at the very least. Many would have reported it as a balloon. But even if this angle is ignored it still could not possibly have been a b alloon at low altitude. The fast flight from Madisonville, the abrupt stop and hour-long hovering at Godman Field, the quick bursts of s peed M antell reported make it impossible. To fly the go miles f rom Madisonville to Fort Knox in 30 minutes, a balloon would require a wind of 18 0 m.p.h. After traveling at this hurricane speed, it would then h ave had to come to a dead stop ab ove Godman Field. As the P-51 's app roached, it would have had to speed tip again to 18 0, then to more than 36 0 to keep ahead of Mantell. The three fighter p ilots chased the mysterious object for half an hour. (I have several times chased ba lloons with a plane, overtaking them in seconds.) In a straight chase, Mantell would have been closing in at 360 ; the tail wind acting on h is fighter would nullify the balloon's forward dr ift. But even if you accept these improba ble factors, there is one final fact t hat nu llifies the ba lloon explanation. The strange o bject had d isapp eared when Mantell's wingman searched the sky, just after the leader's death. If it had"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"been a ba lloon h eld stationary for an h our at a high altitude, and glowing brightly enough to be seen through clouds, it would have remained visible in the same general position. See n from 33 ,000 feet, it would have been even brighter, because o f the clearer air. But t he mysterious object had c ompletely v anished in those few minu tes. A search covering a hun dred miles failed to reveal a trace. Wh ether at a high or low altitude, a ba lloon could not have e scaped the pilot's eyes. It would also have continu ed to be seen at Godman Field and other points, through occasional breaks in the clouds. I pointed out these facts to o ne Air Force o fficer at the Pentagon. Next day he phoned me: \"I figured it out. The timing device went off and the balloon exploded. That's why the pilot didn't see it.\" \"It's an odd c oincidence,\" I said, \"that it exploded in those five minu tes after Mantell's last report.\" \"Even so, it's obviously the answer,\" he said. Checking on this angle, I foun d: 1. No o ne in the Kentucky area had r eported a descending parachu te. 2. No cosmic-ray research instrument case o r p arachu te was f oun d in the area. 3. No instruments were returned to the Navy from t his region. And all ba lloons and instruments released at that time were fully accoun ted for. Even if it had been a balloon, it would not explain the later Ja nu ary 7th reports — the simultaneous s ightings mentioned by Professor Hynek in the Project \"Saucer\" report. This includes the thing seen at Lockbourne Air Force Base two hours after M antell's death. Obviously, the saucer seen flying at 500 m.p.h. over Lockbourne Field could not have been a ba lloon. Even if there had been several balloons in this area (and there were not, by official record), they could not have covered the courses reported. In some cases, they would have been flying against t he wind, at terrific speed."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Then what was the mysterious object? And what killed M antell? Both the Air Force and the Post articles s peculate that Mantell carelessly let himself black out. Since some e xplanation h ad to be given, this might seem a good answer. But Mantell was k nown for coolheaded judgment. As a wartime pilot, he was familiar with signs of anoxia (oxyg en starvation). That he knew his tolerance for altitude is proved by his firmly declared intention to aba ndon the chase at 20 ,000 feet, since he had no o xyg en equipment. Mantell had his altimeter to warn h im. From experience, he would recognize the first vague blurring, narrowing of vision, and other signs of anoxia. Despite this, the \"blackout\" explanation was accepted as plausible by many Americans. Wh ile investigating the Mantell case, I talked with several pilots and aeronautical engineers. Se veral questioned that a P-51 starting a dive from 20 ,000 feet would have disintegrated so thoroughly. \"From thirty thousand feet, yes,\" said one e ngineer. \"If the idea was to explain it away, I'd p ick a high altitude to start from. But a pilotless plane doesn't necessarily dive, as you know. \"It m ight slip off and spin, or spiral down, and a few have e ven landed themselves. Also, if the plane started d own from t wenty thousand, the pilot wouldn't be too far blacked out. The o dds are he'd come to when h e got into thicker air — admitting he did blur out, w hich is only an Air Force guess. I don't see why they're so positive Mantell died before he hit t he groun d — un less they know something we don't.\" One o f the pilot group p ut it m ore blun tly. \"It looks like a cover-up to me. I think Mantell did just what he said he would — close in on the thing. I think he e ither c ollided with it, or more likely they knocked him out of the air. They'd think he was trying to bring them down, barging in like that.\" Even if you accept the blackout answer, it still does not explain what Mantell was chasing. it is possible that, excited by the hu ge, mysterious object, he recklessly climbed beyond the danger level, though such an act was completely at odd s with his character. But t he identity of the thing remains — officially — a mystery. If it was some"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"weird experimental craft or a guided missile, then whose was it? Air Force officers had r epeatedly told me they had no such device. G eneral Carl Touh y Spaa tz, former Air Force chief, had p ublicly insisted that no such weapon h ad been developed in h is regime. Se cretary Symington and General Hoyt Vandenberg, present Air Force chief, had been equally emphatic. O f course, official denials could be e xpected if it were a top-level secret. But if it were a secret device, w ould it be tested so publicly that thousands would see it? If it were an Air Force device, then I could see o nly one answer for the Godman Field incident: The thing was s uch a closely g uarded secret t hat even Colonel Hix hadn't known. That would mean that m ost or all Air Force Base C.O. 's were also in ignorance o f the secret device. Could it be a Navy experiment, kept secret from t he Air Force? I did a little checking. Admiral Calvin Bolster, chief of aeronautics research experimental craft, w as an Ann apolis classmate o f mine. So was Captain Delmer S. Fahrney, head of the Navy g uided-missile program. Fahrney was at Point Mugu, missile-testing ba se in California, and I wasn't ab le to see him. But I knew him as a careful, conscientious officer; I can't believe he would let such a device, piloted or not, hover over an Air Force ba se with no warning to its C.O. I saw Admiral Bolster. His denial seemed genu ine; unless he'd got t o be a dead-pan poker p layer since o ur earlier days, I was s ure he was telling the truth. The o nly other alternate was Russia. It was incredible that they would develop such a device and then expose it to the gaze o f U.S. Air Force o fficers. It could be photographed, its s peed and manoeuvrab ility checked; it m ight crash, or antiaircraft fire might bring it down, The secret might be lost in one such test flight. There was one o ther explanation: The thing was not intended to be seen; it had got out of control. In this event; the long hovering period at Godman Field was caused by the need for r epairs inside the flying saucer, or r epairs to remote-control app aratus. If it were Air Force o r Navy, that would explain official concern; even if completely free o f negligence, the service responsible would be blamed for Mantell's death. If it were Russian, the Air Force would of course try to conceal the fact for fear of public hysteria."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"But if the device was American, it m eant t hat Project \" Saucer\" was a cover-up unit. Wh ile pretending to investigate, it would actually hu sh up reports, make false e xplanations, and safeguard the secret in every possible way. Also, the reported order for Air Force pilots to pursue the disks would have to be a fake. Instead, there would be a secret order telling them to avoid strange o bjects in the sky. By the time I finished my check-up, I was s ure o f one thing: This particular saucer had been real. I was almost positive o f one o ther p oint-that the thing had been over 30 miles high during part of its f light. I foun d that after M antell's death it was reported simultaneously from Madisonville, Elizabethtown, and Lexington — over a distance o f 175 miles. (Professor Hynek's analysis later confirmed this.) How low it had been while hovering over Godman, and d uring Mantell's chase, there was no way to determine. But all the e vidence pointed to a swift ascent after M antell's last report. Had M antell told Godman Tower more than the Air Force admitted? I went ba ck to the Pentagon and asked for a full transcript of the flight leader's radio messages. I g ot a q uick turn-down. The reports, I was told, were still classified as s ecret. Requests for p ictures of the P-51 wreckage, and for a report on the condition of Mantell's body, also drew a blank. I had heard that some photographs were taken of the Godman Field saucer from outside the tower. But the Air Force denied knowledge o f any such pictures. Puzz ling over the ridd le, I remembered John Steele, the former Intelligence captain. If by any chance he was a plant, it would be interesting to suggest the various answers and watch his reaction. Wh en I phoned him to suggest lun cheon, Steele accepted at once. We met at the Occidental, on Pennsylvania Avenu e. Steele was younger than I had expected — not over twenty-five. He was a tall man, w ith a crew haircut and the build of a footba ll player. Looking at him the first time, I expected a certain breeziness. instead, he was almost solemn. \"I owe you an apology,\" he said in a careful voice after we'd ordered. \"You probab ly know I'm a syndicate writer?\" I wondered if he'd foun d out Ja ck Daly was checking on h im. \"Wh en you mentioned the Press Club,\" I said, \"I gathered you were in the"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"business.\" \"I'm afraid you thought I was f ishing for a lead.\" Steele looked at m e earnestly. \"I'm not working on the story — I'm t ied up on other stuff.\" \"Forget it,\" I told him. He seemed anxious to reassure me. \"I'd been worried for some time ab out the saucers. I called you that night on an impulse.\" \"Glad you did,\" I said. \"I need every tip I can get.\" \"Did it help you any?\" \"Yes, though it still doesn't fit t ogether. But I can tell you this: The saucers are real, or at least one o f them.\" \"Wh ich one?\" \"The thing Captain Mantell was chasing near Fort Knox, before he died.\" \"Oh, that one.\" Steele looked d own at the roll he was buttering. \"I thought that case was fully explained. Wasn't he chasing a ba lloon?\" \"The Air Force says it's s till un identified.\" I told him what I had learned. \"App arently y ou're right — it's either an American or a So viet m issile.\" \"After what you've told me,\" said Steele, \"I can't believe it's ours. It must be Russian.\" \"They'd be pretty stupid to test it over here.\" \"You said it was probab ly out of control.\" \"That particular one, maybe. But there have been several hun dred seen over here. If they foun d their c ontrols were haywire, they wouldn't keep testing the things until they'd c orrected that.\" The waiter c ame with the soup, and Steele was s ilent until he left. \"I still can't believe it's our weapon,\" he said slowly. \"They wouldn't have Air Force pilots alerted to chase the things. And I happen to how they do.\" \"There's s omething queer ab out t his missile angle,\" I said. \"That saucer was"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"seen at t he same time by people a hundred and seventy-five miles apart. To be that high in the sky, and still look more than two hun dred and fifty feet in diameter, it must have been enormous.\" Steele didn't answer for a moment. \"Obviously, that was an illusion,\" he finally answered. \"I'd discount t hose estimates.\" \"Even Mantell's? And the Godman Field officers'?\" \"Not knowing the thing's height, how could they judge accurately?\" \"To be seen at points that far apart, it had to be o ver thirty miles high,\" I told him. \"It would have to be hu ge to show up at all.\" He shook his head. \"I can't believe those reports are right. It m ust have been sighted at different times.\" I let it drop. \"Wh at are you working on n ow?\" Steele asked, after a minute o r two. I said I hadn't decided. Actually, I plann ed a trip to the coast, to interview pilots who had sighted flying disks . \"Wh at would you do if you foun d it wasn't a So viet m issile?\" said Steele. He soun ded almost too casual. \"If security was involved, I'd keep still. But the Air Force and the Navy swear they haven't any such things.\" Steele looked at m e thoughtfully. \"You know, True might force something into the o pen that would be better left secret.\" He smiled ironically. \"I realize that sounds peculiar, since I suggested the Russian angle. But if it isn't Russian — though I still think it is — then we have nothing to worry about.\" I was almost sure now that he was a plant. D uring the rest of the lun cheon, I tried to draw him out, but Steele was through talking. Wh en we parted, he gave me a sober warning. \"You and True should c onsider your moral responsibility, no matter what you"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"find. Even if it's not actual security, there may be reasons to keep still.\" After he left me, I tried to figure it out. If the Air Force was ba ck of this, they must not t hink much of my intelligence. O r else they had been in such a hu rry to get a line o n True's investigation that they had no choice but to use Steele. O f course, it was still possible he was doing this on h is own, Either way, his purpose was obvious. He hoped to have us swallow the So viet-missile answer. If we did, then we would have to keep still, even though we foun d absolute proof. O bviously, it would be dangerous to print that story. Thinking ba ck, I recalled Steele's app arent attempt t o dismiss the Mantell case. I was convinced now. The Godman Field affair must hold an important clue that I had overlooked. It m ight even be the key to the whole flying saucer r idd le. ~"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"CHAPTER VI SHORTL Y after my talk with Steele, I flew to the Coast. For three weeks I investigated sightings that had been reported by airline and pr ivate pilots and other c ompetent witnesses. At first, the airline pilots were reluctant t o talk. Most of them remembered the ridicule that had followed p ublished accoun ts by other airline men. One pilot told me he had been ordered to keep still ab out his experience — whether by the company or the Air Force, he would not say. But m ost of them finally agreed to talk, if I kept their names out of print. One airline captain — I'll call him Blake — had encoun tered a saucer at night. He and his copilot had sighted the o bject, gleaming, in the moonlight, half a mile to their left. \"We were at ab out t welve thousand feet,\" he said, w hen we saw this thing pacing us. It didn't have any runn ing lights, but we could see the moonlight reflecting from something like bright m etal. There was a glow along the side, like some kind of light, or exhaust.\" \"Could you make o ut the shape?\" I asked. Blake grinn ed cr ookedly. \"You think we didn't t ry? I cut in toward it. It turned in the same direction. I pulled up about three hun dred feet, and it did the same. Finally, I opened my throttles and c ut in fast, intending to pull tip if we got too close. I needn't have worried. The thing let out a b urst of reddish flame and streaked up out of sight. It was gone in a few seconds.\" \"Then it m ust have been piloted,\" I said. \"If not, it had some kind of radar-responder un it t o make it veer off when anything g ot near it. It m atched every move I made, un til the last one.\" I asked him what he thought t he saucer was. Blake hesitated, then he gave me a slow grin. \"Well, my copilot t hinks it was a space ship. He says no pilot here o n earth could take that m any G's, w hen the thing zoomed.\" I'd heard some \"m en from Mars\" opinions about t he saucers, but this was an experienced p ilot."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"\"You don't believe that?\" I said. \"No,\" Blake said. \"I figure it was s ome new type o f guided missile. If it took as many G's as Chu ck, my copilot, thinks, then it m ust have been on a b eam and remote-controlled.\" Later, I found two o ther p ilots who had the same idea a s Chu ck. O ne captain was afraid the flying saucers were Russian; his copilot thought they were Air Force o r Navy. I met one airline o fficial who was indignant about t esting such missiles near the airways. \"Even if they do have some device to make them veer off,\" he said, \"I think it's a risk. There'll be hell to pay if one e ver hits an airliner.\" \"They've been flying aroun d for two years,\" a line pilot pointed out. \"Nobody's had a close call yet. I don't think there's much danger.\" Wh en I left the Coast, I flew to New York. K en Purdy called in John DuBarry, True's aviation editor, to hear the details. Purdy called him \"John the S keptic.\" After I told them what I had learned Purdy nodd ed. \"Wh at do you think the saucers are?\" asked DuBarry. \"They must be guided missiles,\" I said, \"but it leaves s ome queer gaps in the picture.\" I had made up a list of possible answers, and I read it to them: \"One, the saucers don't exist. They're caused by mistakes, hysteria, and so o n. Two, they're Russian guided missiles. Three, they're American guided missiles. Four, the whole thing is a hoax, a psychological-warfare trick.\" \"You mean a trick of ours?\" said Purdy. \"Sure, to make the So viets think we could reach them with a guided missile. But I don't think that's the answer — I just listed it as a possibility.\" DuBarry considered this thoughtfully. \"In the first place, you'd have to bring thousands of people into the scheme, so the disks would be reported often enough to get publicity. You'd have to have some kind of device, maybe something launched from highflying bombers, to give the rumours s ubstance. They'd c ertainly do a b etter job than this, to put it over. And it wouldn't explain the world-wide sightings. Also, Captain"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Mantell wouldn't kill himself just to carry out an official hoax.\" \"John 's right,\" said Purdy. \"Anyway, it's too ponderous.

But there are some points that just won't fit the missile theory.\" \"You've left out one answer,\" said Purdy. \"Wh at's that?\" \"Interplanetary.\" \"You're kidding!\" I said. \"I didn't say I believed it,\" said Purdy. \"I just say it's possible.\" DuBarry was watching me. \"I know how you feel. That's how it hit m e when Ken first said it,\" \"I've heard it before,\" I said. \"But I never took it seriously.\" \"Maybe this will i nterest you,\" Purdy said. He gave me a note from Sam Boal: \"Just t alked with D ——— -,\" t he note ran. (D------- is a prominent aeronautical engineer, the designer of a world-famous plane.) \"He believes the disks may be interplanetary and that the Air Force knows it — or at least suspects it. I'm enclosing sketches showing how he thinks the disks operate.\" \"He's not t he first one who told us that,\" said Purdy. \"We've heard the same thing from other engineers. O ver a dozen airline pilots think they're coining from out in space. And there's a rocket expert at Wright Field who's warned Project 'Saucer' that t he things are interplanetary. That's why I 'm not writing it off.\" \"Have you read the Project 'Saucer' ideas on space travel?\" DuBarry asked me. I told him m y copy hadn't reached me. He read me some marked paragraphs in his copy of the preliminary report:"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"\"'There has been speculation that the aerial phenomena might actually be some form of penetration from another p lanet . . . the e xistence o f intelligent life o n Mars is not impossible but is completely unproven . . . the possibility of intelligent life o n the Planet Venu s is not considered completely un reasonab le by astronomers . . .

Wh ile John was getting it, Purdy went on: \"Be careful ab out t his man Steele. After what he said about 'moral responsibility' I'm sure he's planted.\" I thought ba ck to S teele's warning. I told Purdy: \"If he had the space thing in mind, maybe he's right. It could set off a panic that would make that Orson Welles thing look like a picnic.\" \"Certainly it could,\" Purdy said. \"We'd have to handle it carefully-if it turned out t o be the truth. But I think the Air Force is making a mistake, if that's what they're hiding. It could break the wrong way and be serious.\" John DuBarry came back with the file o f old r eports. \"It m ight interest you to know,\" he said, \"that the Air Force checked all these old sightings too.\" The idea was still a difficult one for me to believe. \"Those space-travel suggestions might be a trick,\" I said. \"The Air Force may be hinting at that to hide the guided-missile secret.\" \"Yes, but later on they deny the space thing,\" said Purdy. \"It looks as if they're trying to put people o n guard and then play it down, so they won't get"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"scared.\" As I put t he historic reports f ile in my brief case, Purdy handed me a letter from an investigator named Hilton, w ho had been working in the So uthwest. I skimm ed over his letter. Hilton had heard of s ome unusual night sightings in New Mexico. The story had been hushed up, but he had learned some details f rom a pilot at Albuquerque. One o f these mysterious \"flying lights\" had been seen at Las Vegas, on December 8, 194 8 — just one month before Mantell was killed in Kentucky. It was too dark to make o ut the shape behind the light, but all witnesses had agreed on its performance. The thing had c limbed at tremendous speed, its upward motion shown by a bright green light. Though the green glow w as much brighter than a plane's running light, all plane schedules were carefully checked. \"I think they were trying to pin it on a j et fighter,\" the Albuquerque pilot told Hilton. \"But there weren't any jets near there. Anyway, the thing climbed too fast. It must have been making close to nine hundred miles an h our.\" The Air Force had also checked balloon release times — app arently just for the record, since no balloon could even appr oach the saucer's terrific ascent. Again, they drew a b lank. \"From the way this was hu shed up,\" Hilton commented, \"they seem t o be worried ab out this group of sightings. I've heard two reports that the F.B.I. is tied into the deal somehow, but that's as far as I can get.\" \"See if you can get any lead on that,\" Purdy told me. \"That F.B.I. business puzz les me. Where would they come in?\" I said I would try to find out. But it was almost four months before we learned the answer: The F.B.I. men h ad been witnesses. (This was later admitted in an obscure cross- reference in the final Project \" Saucer\" report. But all official answers to the strange green-light sightings had been carefully omitted. The cases concerned were 223 , 224 , 225 , 226 , 227 , 230 , and 231 , which will be discussed later.) \"Wh en you go ba ck to Washington,\" said Purdy, \"see what reaction you get to the interplanetary idea.\" I had a pretty g ood idea what t he reaction would be, but I nodd ed. \"O.K . I'll"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"go flag a space ship and be o n my way.\" \"O.K. — gag it up,\" said Purdy. \"But don't sell it short, If by any chance it's true, it'll be the biggest story since the birth of Christ.\" ~"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"CHAPTER VII IT WAS DARK w hen the airliner limousine reached La Guardia Field. I had intended taking an earlier p lane, but DuBarry persuaded me to stay over for dinn er. We dropp ed into the Algonquin, next door to True's office building. Halfway through dinn er, I asked John what he thought of the space-travel answer. \"Oh, it's possible,\" he said cautiously. \"The time and space angles make it hard to take, but if we're planning to e xplore space within fifty years, there's no reason some o ther p lanet people couldn't do it. O f course, if they've been observing us f or over a century, as those o ld sightings s eem t o indicate, they must be far ahead of us, at least in techn ical progress.\" Later on, he said thoughtfully, \"Even though it's possible, I hate to think it's the answer. just imagine the impact on the world. We'd have to reorient our whole lives-- and things are complicated enough already.\" Standing at t he gate, w aiting for my plane to be called, I thought over that angle. Assuming that space travel was the solution--which I still couldn't believe-what would be the e ffect on the world? It was a hard thing to picture. So much depended on the visitors f rom space. Wh at would their p urpose be? Would they be peaceful or hostile? Wh y had they been observing the e arth so intensively in the past few years? I could think of a hun dred questions. Wh at would the space people be like? Would they be similar to men and women on earth, or some fearsome Buck Rogerish creatures who would terrify the average American--including myself? It was obvious they would be far superior to us in many ways. But t heir civilization might be e ntirely different. Evolution might have developed their minds, and p ossibly their bodies, along lines we couldn't even grasp. Perhaps we couldn't even comm un icate with them. Wh at would be the net effect of making contact with beings f rom a distant planet? Would earthlings be terrified, or, if it seemed a peaceful exploration, would we bc intrigued by the thought of a great adventure? It would depend entirely on the space visitors' motives, and how the world was prepared for such a revelation."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"The more I thought about it, the more fantastic thc thing seemed. And yet it hadn't been too long since airplane flight was considered an idiot's dream. This scene here at La Guardia would have seemed p ure fantasy in 190 0--thc hu ge Constellations and DC-6's; the double-decked Stratocruisers, sweeping in from all over the country; the big ships at Pan-American, taking off f or p oints all over the globe. We'd c ome a long way in the forty-six y ears since the Wright brothers' first flight. But space travel! The gateman checked my ticket, and I went out t o the Washington plane. It was a luxury ship, a fifty-two-passenger, four-engined DC-6, scheduled to be in the capital one hour after take-off. By morning this plane, the Aztec, would be in Mexico City. The couple going up the gangway ahead of me were in their late sixties. Fifty years ago, w hat would they have said if s omeone had pr edicted this f light? The answer to that was easy; at that t ime, high-school songbooks f eatured a well-known piece e ntitled \"Darius Green and His Flying Machine.\" Darius, it seems, w as a simple-minded lad who actually thought he could fly. Fifty y ears. That was the time the Air Force had estimated it would take us to start exploring space. Would Americans come to accept space travel as matter-of-factly as the people now boarding this plane? The youngsters would, probab ly; the o lder ones, as a rule, would be a little more cautious. In the o val loun ge at t he rear of the plane, I took out t he file o f old sighting reports. G lancing through it, I, saw excerpts from nineteenth-century astronomical and scientific journals and extracts f rom official gazettes. Most of the e arly sightings had been in Great Britain and on the Continent, w ith a few reports scattered aroun d the world. The American reports did not begin un til the latter p art of the century. The DC-6 rolled out and took off. For a few minu tes I watched the lights of Manh attan and Greater New York twinkling below. The Empire S tate Building tower was s till above us, as the plane ba nked over the East River. We climbed quickly, and the familiar outline o f Manhattan took shape like a map p in-pointed with millions of lights."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Any large city seen from t he air at night has a certain magic, New York most of all. Looking down, I thought: Wh at would a spaceman think, seeing this brilli antly lighted c ity, the towering skyscrapers? Would other p lanets have such cities, or would it be something new and p uzz ling to a visitor from space? Turning ba ck to the o ld r eports, I skipp ed through un til I foun d the American sightings. O ne o f the first was an incident at Bonh am, Texas, in the summer of 18 73. It was broad d aylight when a strange, fast-moving object app eared in the sky, southwest of the town. For a moment, the people o f Bonh am stared at the thing, not believing their eves. The o nly flying device then known was the drifting ba lloon. But t his thing was tremendous, and speeding so fast its outlines were almost a blur. Terrified farmers dived un der their wagons. Townspeople fled indoors. O nly a few hardy souls remained in the streets. The mysterious object circled Bonh am t wice, then raced off to the cast and vanished. D escriptions of the strange machine varied from roun d or oval to cigar-shaped. (The details of the Bonh am sighting were later c onfirmed for me by F rank Edwards, Mutual network newscaster, w ho investigated this case.) Twenty-four hours after the Bonh am incident, a device o f the same description app eared at Fort Scott, K ansas. Panic-stricken soldiers f led the parade groun d as the thing flashed overhead. In a few seconds it disapp eared, circling toward the north. Until now, I had supp osed that the term \"saucer\" was original with Kenneth Arnold. Actually, the first to compare a flying object with a saucer was John Martin, a farmer who lived near Denison, Texas. The Denison Daily News of Ja nuary 25 , 18 78, gives the following accoun t: From Mr. John Martin, a farmer who lives some six miles south of this city, we learn the following strange story: Tuesday morning while o ut hu nting, his attention was directed to a dark object high u p in the southern sky. The peculiar shape and velocity with which the o bject seemed to appr oach riveted his attention and he strained his eves to discover its character. Wh en first noticed, it app eared to be ab out the size o f an orange, w hich continu ed to grow in size. After gazing at it for some time Mr. Martin became blind from long looking and left off viewing it for a time in order to rest his eyes. O n resuming his view, the o bject was almost overhead and had increased c onsiderab ly in size, and app eared to be going through space at"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"wonderful speed. Wh en directly over him it was about t he size o f a large saucer and was evidently at great height. Mr. Martin thought it resembled, as well as he could judge, a ba lloon. It went as rapidly as it had c ome and was s oon lost to sight in the heavenly skies. Mr . Martin is a gentleman of undoubted veracity and this s trange o ccurrence, if it was not a balloon, deserves the attention of our scientists. In the file, I saw a memo DuBarry had written: \"I would take the very early reports with caution. For instance, the o ne o n August 9, 1762 , which describes an odd , spindle-shaped body traveling at high speed toward the sun . I recall that Charles Fort accepted this, along with other early sightings, as evidence o f space ships. But t his particular thing might have been a meteor--meteors as such were almost un known then. The later r eports are more convincing, and it is also e asier to check the sources, especially those from 18 70 on.\" From 1762 to 1870 , the reports were meager. So me described mysterious lights in the sky; a few mentioned r oun d objects s een in daylight. Even though they were not so fully documented as later ones, one point struck me. In those days, there was no telegraph, telephone, or r adio to spread news rapidly and start a flood of rumors. {p. 59 } A sighting in Scotland c ould not be the cause o f a similar one two days later in the south of France. Beginn ing in 870 , there was a series of reports that went on to the turn of the century. In the London Times, September 26 , 187 0, there was a description of a queer object t hat was seen crossing the moon. It was reported as elliptical, with some kind of tail, and it t ook almost thirty seconds to complete its passage o f the moon. Then in 187 1, a large, round body was s ighted above Marseilles, France. This was on August 1. It m oved slowly across the sky, app arently at great height, and was visible ab out fifteen minu tes. On March 22 , 1880 , several brilli antly luminous objects were reported seen at Kattenau, Germany. Sighted just before sun rise, they were described as rising from the horizon and moving from east t o west. The accoun t was published in the British Nature Magazine, Volume 22 , page 64. The next report in the file mentioned briefly a strange round object seen in the skies over Bermuda. The source for this accoun t was the Bermuda Royal Gazette. This was in 18 85. That same year, an astronomer and other witnesses reported a gigantic aerial object at Adrianople, Turkey. O n November 1, the weird app arition was s een moving across the sky. O bservers"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"described it as roun d and four to five times the size o f the moon. This estimate is s imilar to the Denison, Texas, comparison with an orange. The o bject would actually be huge to be seen at any g reat height. But unless the true height were known, any estimate o f size would be guesswork. On March 19, 1887 , two strange o bjects fell i nto the sea near a Dutch ba rkentine. As described by the skipp er, Captain C. D. S weet, one o f the objects was dark, the o ther brightly luminous. The glowing object fell with a loud r oaring soun d; the shipmaster was positive it was not a meteor. In New Zealand, a year later, an oval-shaped d isk was reported speeding high overhead. This was on May 4, 1888 . About two years after this, several large aerial bodies were sighted hovering over the Dutch East Indies. {p. 60 } Most accounts described them as roughly triangular, about one hun dred feet on the base and two hundred feet on the sides. But some o bservers thought they might be longer and narrower, w ith a rounded ba se; this would make them agree with more recent stories of cone-shaped objects with roun ded tops seen in American skies. On August 26, 1894 , a British admiral reported sighting a large disk with a projection like a tail. And a year after this, both England and Scotland buzz ed with stories of triangular-shaped objects like those seen in the Dutch East Indies. Although many officials s coffed at t he stories, more than one astronomer stuck to his belief that t he mysterious things might be coming from outer space. Since planes and d irigibles were then un known, there was no o ne o n earth who could have been responsible for them. In 1897 , sightings in the United States began to be more frequent. O ne o f the strangest reports describes an incident t hat began on April 9. Flying at a great height, a huge cigar-shaped d evice was s een in the Midwest. Short wings projected from t he sides of the o bject, according to reports of astronomers who watched it through telescopes. For almost a week, the aerial visitor was sighted around the Midwest, as f ar south as St. Louis and as far west as Colorado. Se veral times, red, green, and white lights were seen to flash in the sky; some witnesses thought the crew of this s trange craft m ight be trying to signal the e arth. On April 16 , the thing, w hatever it was, disapp eared from t he Midwest. But on April 19 , the same o bject--or else a similar one--app eared over West Virginia. Early that m orning the town of Sisterville was awakened by blasts of the sawmill whistle. Those who went outside their homes s aw a strange sight. From a torpedo-shaped object overhead, dazzling searchlights were"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"pointing downward, sweeping the countryside. The thing app eared to be ab out two hun dred feet long, some thirty feet in diameter, w ith stubb y wings and r ed and green lights along the sides. For almost t en minu tes the aerial visitor c ircled the town, then it swun g eastward and vanished. The next report was published in the U.S. Weather Bureau's monthly Weather Review. O n page 11 5 in the March 1904 issue, there is an accoun t of an odd sighting at sea. O n February 24 , 190 4, a mysterious light had been seen ab ove the Atlantic by crew members of the U.S.S. Supp ly. It was moving swiftly, and evidently at high altitude. The report was attested by L ieutenant Frank H . Schofield, U.S.N. On July 2, 1907 , a mysterious explosion occurred, in the heavens near Burlington, Vermont. So me witnesses described a strange, torpedo-shaped device circling above. Shortly after it was s een, a roun d, luminous object flashed d own from t he sky, then exploded, (Weather Review, 1907 , page 310 .) Another cigar-shaped cr aft was reported at a low altitude o ver Bridgewater, Massachusetts, in 19 05. Like the o ne at Sisterville, it carried searchlights, which swept ba ck and forth across the coun tryside. After a few moments, the visitor r ose in a steep c limb, and the searchlights blinked out. There was no report for 19 09 in America, though an odd aerial object was sighted near the Galapagos Islands. But in 1910 , one Ja nu ary morning, a large silvery cigar-shaped d evice startled Chattanooga. After about five minu tes, the thing sped away, appearing over Hun tsville, Alaba ma, shortly afterward. It m ade a second app earance o ver Chattanooga the next day, then headed east and was never seen again. In Popular Astronomy, Ja nuary 27, 1012 , a Dr. F. B. Harris described an intensely black object t hat he saw crossing the moon. As nearly as he could tell, it was gigantic in size--though again there was no way to be sure o f its distance from him or the moon. With careful understatement, D r. Harris said, \"I think a very interesting and c urious phenomenon happened that night.\" A strange shadow w as noted on the clouds at Fort Worth, Texas, on April 8, 19 , 3. It app eared to be caused by some large body hovering motionless above the clouds. As the cloud layer moved, the shadow remained in the same position. Then it changed size, diminishing, and quickly disapp eared, as if it had r isen vertically. A report on this was given in the Weather Bureau Review of that year, Number 4-599. By 1919 , dirigibles were o f course well known to most of the world. Wh en a"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"dirigible-shaped object app eared over Hun tington, West Virginia, in July of that year, there was no great alarm. It was believed to be an American blimp, though the darkness-- it was eleven at night--prevented observers f rom being sure. But a later c heck-up pr oved it was not an American ship, nor was it from any coun try possessing such craft. For some time after this, there were few authentic r eports. Then in 1934 , Ni cholas Roerich, head of the American-Roerich expedition into Tibet, had a remarkable e xperience that bears on the saucer ridd le. On pages 361 a nd 362 of his book Altai Himalaya, Roerich describes the incident. The e xpedition party was in the wilds of Tibet one morning when a porter noticed the peculiar actions of a b uzz ard overhead. He called Roerich's attention to it; then they all saw something high in the sky, moving at great speed from north to south. Watching it through binoculars, Roerich saw it was oval-shaped, obviously of hu ge size, and r eflecting the sun's rays like brightly polished metal. Wh ile he trailed it with h is glasses, the o bject sudd enly changed d irection, from south to southwest. It was gone in a few moments. This was the last sighting listed before World War II. Wh en I had finished, I stared out the plane window, curiously disturbed. Like most people, I had grown u p believing the e arth was the center of everything--life, intelligence, and r eligion. Now, for the first t ime in my life, that belief was shaken. It was a curious thing. I could accept t he idea that we would eventually explore space, land on the moon, and go o n to distant planets. I had r ead of the plans, and I knew our engineers and scientists would somehow find a way. It did not disturb my belief in our superiority. But faced with this evidence o f a superior race in the un iverse, my mind rebelled. For years, I had been accustomed to thinking in comic-strip terms of any possible spacemen--Buck Rogers s tuff, with weird-looking space ships and green-faced M artians. But now, if these sightings were true, the shoe was on the o ther foot. We would be faced with a race o f beings at least two hu ndred years ahead of our civilization--perhaps thousands. In their eyes, w e might look like primitives. My conjectures before the take-off had just been idle thinking; I had not really believed this could be the answer. But now the question came back sharply. How w ould we react to a sudd en appearance o f space ships, bringing"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"that higher r ace to the e arth? If we were fully prepared, educated to this tremendous adventure, it might come o ff without t rouble. Unprepared, w e would be thrown into panic. The lights of Philadelphia showed up ahead, and a thought struck me. Wh at would Philadelphians of 17 76 have thought t o see this DC-6 flying across their c ity at three hun dred miles an h our? What would the sentries at Valley Forge have done, a year later, if this lighted airliner had streaked over their heads? Madness. Stampede. Those were the plain answers. But t here was a difference now. We had had modern miracles, radio, television, supersonic planes, and the promise o f s till more miracles. We could be e ducated, or at least partly prepared, to accept space visitors. In fifty y ears we had learned to fly. In fifty y ears more, w e would be exploring space. Wh y should we believe such creative intelligence was limited to the e arth? It would be incredible if the e arth, out of all the milli ons of planets, proved the o nly inh abited spot in the whole un iverse. But, instinctively, I still fought against believing that the flying saucers were space ships. Eventually, w e would make contact with races on other p lanets; they undoubtedly would someday v isit the e arth. But if it could be put off . . . a problem for later generations to handle . . . If the disks proved American guided missiles, it would be an easier answer. Looking through the Project \" Saucer\" report DuBarry had loaned me, I read the space-travel items, hoping to find some hint that this was a smoke screen. On page 18, in a discussion on Mars, I found this comment: \"Reports of strange o bjects s een in the skies have been h anded d own through the generations. However, scientists believe that if Martians were now visiting the e arth without estab lishing contact, it could be assumed that they have just recently succeeded in space travel, and that their c ivilization would be practically abreast of ours. This because they find it hard to believe that any techn ically established r ace would c ome here, flaunt its ab ility in mysterious ways over the years, but each time simply g o way without ever estab lishing contact.\" There could be several answers to that. The Martians might not be able to live in our atm osphere, except in their sealed space ships. They, or some other planet race, could have o bserved us periodically to check on our slow"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"progress. Until we began to appr oach their level of civilization, or in some way caused them concern, they would pr obab ly see no reason for trying to make contact. But somehow I found a vague comfort in the argument, full of holes though it was. Se arching further, I found other space-travel comm ents. O n one page, the Air Force admitted it was almost a certainty that space travelers would be operating from planets outside the solar system. But on the following page, I discovered this s entence: \"Thu s, although visits from outer space are believed to be possible, they are thought to be highly improbable.\" Wh at was the answer? Was this just a wandering discussion of possibilities, ba dly put together, or was it a hint of the truth? it could be the first step in preparing America for a revelation. It could also be a carefully thought-out trick. This whole report might be designed to conceal a secret weapon. If the Air Force o r the Navy did have a secret missile, what better way to distract attention? The o ld sighting reports could have been seized on as a b uildup for space travel hints. Then suddenly it hit m e. Even if it were a smoke screen, w hat of those o ld r eports? They still remained to be answered. There was only one possible e xplanation, un less you discarded the sightings as lies. That m eant discrediting many reliab le witnesses-- naval officers, merchant shipmasters, explorers, astronomers, ministers, and r esponsible public officials. {p. 65 } Besides all these, there had been thousands of other witnesses, w here large groups had seen the o bjects. The answer seemed inevitab le, but I held it off. I didn't want t o believe it, with all the changes it m ight bring, the un predictable e ffect upon our civilization. If I kept on checking I might find evidence that would bring a different explanation for the present saucers. DuBarry had put another group of reports in the e nvelope; this series covered the World War II phase and on u p to the o utbreak of the saucer scare in the United States. So me o f it, about the foo fighters, I already knew. This was tied in with the mystery rockets reported over Sweden. The first Swedish sightings had occurred d uring the e arly part of the war. Most of the so-called"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"\"ghost rockets\" were seen at night, moving at tremendous speed. Since they came from t he direction of Germany, most Swedes believed that guided rockets were the answer. During the summ er of 1946 , after the Russians had taken over Peenemun de, the Nazi missile test base, ghost rockets again were reported flying over Sweden. So me were said to double back and fly into So viet areas. Practically all were seen at night, and therefore none had been described as a flying disk. Instead, they were said to be colored lights, red, green, blue, and orange, often blurred from t heir high speed. But there was a puzz ling complication. Mystery lights, and sometimes f lying disks , w ere simultaneously reported over Greece, Portugal, Turkey, Spain, and even French Morocco. Either there were two answers, or some nation had developed missiles with an incredibly long range. By Ja nuary 1947 , ghost-rocket sightings in Europe had d iminished to less than one a month. O dd ly enough, the first disk report admitted by P roject \"Saucer\" was in this same month. The first '47 case detailed by P roject \"Saucer\" occurred at Richmond, Virginia. It was ab out the midd le o f April. A Richmond weather observer had r eleased a ba lloon and was tracking it with a theodolite when a strange o bject crossed his f ield of vision. He swun g the theodolite and managed to track the thing, despite its high speed. (The actual speed and altitude--the latter d etermined by a comparison of the ba lloon's height at various times-- have never been released. Nor has the Air Force released this observer's report on the o bject's s ize, w hich Project \"Saucer\" admitted was more accurate than most witnesses' estimates.) About t he seventeenth of May 1947 , a hu ge o val-shaped saucer ten times longer than its diameter was sighted by Byron Savage, an Oklahoma City pilot. Two days later, another fast-flying saucer was reported at Manitou Springs, Colorado. In the short time it was observed, it was s een to change direction twice, maneuvering at an un believab le speed. Then on June 24 came Kenn eth Arnold's f amous report, w hich set off the saucer scare. The rest of the story I now knew almost by heart. Wh en the DC-6 landed at Washington, I had made o ne decision. Since it was impossible to check up on most of the o ld sightings, I would c oncentrate o n certain recent reports-- cases in which the o bjects had been described as space ships. As I waited for a taxi, I looked up at t he sky. It was a clear summ er night, without a single cloud. Beyond the low hill to the west I could see the stars."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"I can still remember thinking, If it's true, then the stars will never again seem t he same. ~"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"CHAPTER VIII NEXT MORNING, in the broad light of day, the idea of space visitors somehow had lost its menace. If the disks were space ships, at least they had shown no sign of hostility, so far as I knew. O f course, there was Mantell; but if he had been downed by some weapon on the disk, it could have been self-defence. In most cases, the saucers retreated at the first sign of pursuit. My mind was s till reluctant to accept the space-travel answer, in spite o f the old r eports. But I kept t hinking of the famous aircraft designer who thought the disks were space craft; the airline pilots Purdy had mentioned; Blake's copilot, Chuck... Now that I recalled it, Blake had been more e mba rrassed than seemed c alled for when he told about Chuck. Perhaps he had been the o ne who believed the saucers were space ships, instead of his ab sent copilot. After breakfast, I went over the list of sightings s ince June 19 47. There were several saucers that actually had been described as projectile-like ships. The most famous of all was the Eastern Airlines case. It was 8:30 P.M., July 23 , 194 8, w hen an Eastern Airlines DC-3 took off from Houston, Texas, on a flight t o Atlanta and Boston. The airliner c aptain was Clarence S . Chiles. D uring the war, he had been in the Air Transport Comm and, w ith the rank of lieutenant colonel. He had 8,500 flying hours. His f irst officer was John B. Wh itted, a wartime pilot on B-29 's. Both men were known in Eastern as careful, conservative pilots. It was a b right, moonlit night, w ith scattered c louds overhead. The DC-3 was twenty miles west of Montgomery, at 2:45 A.M., w hen a b rilliant projectile-like craft came hu rtling along the airway. Chiles s aw it first and took it t o be a j et plane. But the next instant both pilots s aw that this was no jet fighter. \"It was heading southwest,\" Chiles s aid later, \"exactly opp osite to o ur c ourse. Wh atever it was, it flashed d own toward us at terrific speed. We veered to the left. It veered sharply, too, and p assed us about seven hun dred feet t o the right. I saw then that it had no wings.\" The mystery ship p assed on Whitted's side, and he had a fairly close look."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"\"The thing was ab out one hun dred feet long, cigar-shaped, and wingless,\" he described it. \"It was ab out t wice the diameter of a B-twenty-nine, w ith n o protruding fins.\" Captain Chiles s aid the cab in app eared like a pilot compartment, except for its eerie brilli ance. Both he and Whitted agreed it was as bright as a magnesium flare. They saw no o ccupants, but at t heir speed this was not. surpr ising. \"An intense dark-blue glow came from t he side o f the ship,\" Chiles reported. (It was later suggested by engineers that the strange glare could have come from a power p lant of unu sual type.) \"It ran the e ntire length of the fuselage — like a blue fluorescent light. The e xhaust was a red-orange flame, with a lighter c olour p redominant aroun d the o uter edges.\" Both pilots s aid the flame e xtended thirty to fifty feet behind the ship. As it passed, Chiles noted a snout like a radar p ole. Both he and Wh itted glimpsed two rows of windows. \"Just as it went by,\" said Chiles, \"the pilot pulled up as if he had seen the DC-three and wanted to avoid its. There was a tremendous burst of flame from t he rear. It zoomed into the clouds, its jet wash rocking our DC-three.\" Chiles's estimate o f the mystery ship's s peed was between five hun dred and seven h undred miles an h our. As the o bject vanished, Chiles went ba ck into the cabin to check with the passengers. Most had been asleep or were drowsing. But one man confirmed that they were in their r ight senses. This passenger, Clarence Mc Kelvie o f Columbus, O hio, told them (and a Project \" Saucer\" t eam later) that he had seen a b rilli ant streak of light flash past his window. It had gone too swiftly for him t o catch any details. The A.P. interviewed M r. Mc Kelvie soon after he landed, and r an the following story: \"Kenn ett Square, Pa., July 24 (AP) . Clarence L. Mc Kelvie, assistant managing editor of the American Education Press, said he was the o nly passenger on the EAL Houston-Boston plane who was not asleep when the phantom craft was sighted. \"'I saw no shape o r form,' Mr . Mc Kelvie said. 'I was on the right side o f the plane, and sudd enly I saw this s trange ee rie streak out of my window. It was very intense, not like lightning or anything I had ever seen.'"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"\"The Columbus man said he was too startled and the o bject m oved too quickly for him t o adjust his eyes to it.\" In W ashington, Air Force o fficials insisted they could shed no light on the mystery. O ut in Santa Monica, G eneral George C. K enn ey, then chief of the Strategic Air Command, declared the Air Force had nothing remotely like the ship d escribed. \"I wish we did,\" General Kenn ey told r eporters. \"I'd sure like to see that.\" The publicized story of this \"space ship\" set off another scare — also the usual cracks ab out screwba ll pilots. But Chiles and Wh itted were not screwba lls; they were highly respected p ilots. The passenger's confirmation add ed weight. But even if all three had been considered d eluded, the Air Force investigators could not get around the reports from Robbins Air Force Base. Just ab out one hour before the DC-3 incident, a strange flaming object came racing southward through the night skies over Robb ins Field, at Macon, Georgia. O bservers at the air base were astoun ded to see what app eared to be a hu ge, w ingless craft streak overhead, trailing a varicoloured exhaust. (The witnesses' description tallied with those o f Chiles and Wh itted.) The mystery ship vanished swiftly; all observers agreed that it disapp eared from t he line of sight just like a normal aircr aft. Wh ile I was working on this case, a contact in W ashington gave me an interesting tip. \"Within forty-eight hours after that Eastern sighting, Air Force e ngineers rushed out blueprint plans and elevations of the 'space ship,' based on what the two pilots told them.\" Wh ether or not t his was true, I foun d that t he Air Force e ngineers did compute the proba ble speed and lift of the mystery craft. The ship was foun d to be within the boun ds of aerodynamic laws for operations in our atm osphere. Here is the Air Force statement: \"App lication of the Prandtl theory of lift indicated that a fuselage o f the dimensions reported by Chiles and Wh itted c ould supp ort a load comparable to the weight of an aircr aft of this s ize, at flying speeds in the sub-sonic range.\" (This s upports Chiles's estimate o f 500 -700 m.p.h.) Four d ays after the space-ship story was published, a Navy spokesman was quoted as hinting it m ight have been a high-atm osphere rocket gone astray"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"from t he proving groun ds in New Mexico. The brief report app eared on the editorial page o f the Washington Star on July 28 , 1947 . It ran as follows: \"The Navy says that naval techn icians have been testing a 3,000-mile-per-hour r ocket in New Mexico. If one went astray, it could travel across our c ontinent in a short time.\" At first glance I thought this might be the real answer to the Chiles-Whitted case. But after a few minu tes I saw it was almost impossible. First, rockets at Wh ite S ands are launched and c ontrolled with u tmost care. There have been no reported c ases of such a long-distance runaway. Se cond, if such a rocket had gone astray, it would c ertainly have caused wild confusion at White S ands un til they found where it landed. Hundreds of people would have known ab out it; the story would be certain to leak out. Third, such a rocket would have had to travel from White S ands to Macon, Georgia, then circle aroun d south of this city for over forty minu tes. (If it had kept on at t he speed observed at Robb ins Field, it would have passed Montgomery long before the DC-3 reached the area.) In addition, the rocket would have had to veer sharply away from t he airliner, as both pilots testified, and then z oom into the clouds. No high-atmosphere test rocket has automatic c ontrols s uch as this would r equire. And if it had gone astray from Wh ite S ands, the station's remote control would no longer be guiding it. The Eastern Airlines \"space ship,\" then, w as not just a fugitive rocket. But it could be a new type o f aircraft, something revolutionary, developed in ab solute secrecy. Other airline pilots had r eported flying disks racing along the airways, though none that I knew of had d escribed pr ojectile-like o bjects. Chiles and Wh itted insisted the mystery ship was not a disk, and the report from Robb ins Field agreed on this point. Man-made devices or not, it seemed fairly certain there was more than one type o f saucer. The more I studied the e vidence, the harder it was to believe that this was an earth-made ship. Such a wingless rocket ship would r equire tremendous jet power to keep it in the air. Even our latest jet bombers could not begin to appr oach its performance. Going ba ck over the Project \"Saucer\" preliminary report, I foun d strong evidence that the Air Force was worried. In their investigation, Project teams had screened 225 military and civilian flight schedules. After nine months,"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"they reported that the mysterious object was no conventional aircr aft. On April 27 , 194 9, the Air Force admitted that Project \"Saucer\" had failed to find the answer. The \"space ship\" was officially listed as un identified. \"But Wright Field is s till working on it,\" an Air Force o fficer told me. \"Both Chiles and Wh itted are responsible pilots, and M cKelvie has a reputation for making careful statements. Even without the Robb ins Field c onfirmation, no one could d oubt that they saw something.\" The Chiles-Whitted \"space ship\" was not t he first of this type to be reported. Another wingless aircraft was s ighted in August 1947 , by two pilots f or an Alaba ma flying service. It was at Bethel, Alaba ma, just after sunset, when a hu ge black wingless craft swept across their c ourse. Silhouetted against t he evening sky, it loomed larger than a C-54 . The pilots s aw no wings, motors, or jet exhausts. Swinging in behind the mystery ship, they attempted to follow. But at t heir speed of 170 m.p.h. they were quickly outdistanced. Careful checking showed there were no o ther p lanes nearby that could have been mistaken for this strange craft. On New Year's Day, 1948 , a similar r ocket-shaped object was s ighted at Ja ckson, Mississippi. It was f irst seen by a former Air Force pilot and his passenger, and later by witnesses on the groun d. Before the pilot could begin to close in, the o dd wingless ship p ulled away. Speeding up from 200 to 500 m.p.h., it swiftly disapp eared. Besides these two cases, already on record, I had the tips Purdy had given me. O ne wingless s hip was s upposed to have been seen three o r four d ays before the Chiles-Wh itted sighting; like the thing they reported, the un identified c raft was a double-decked \"space ship\" but m oving at even higher speed. At first I ran into a stone wall trying to check this s tory. Then I foun d a lead c onforming that this was a foreign report. It finally proved to be from The Hague. The tip had been right. This double-decked, w ingless s hip had been sighted on July 20, 194 8 — four d ays before the Eastern case. Witnesses had r eported it at a high altitude, moving at fantastic speed. Wh ile working on this report, I v erified another tip. We had heard a rumour of a space-ship sighting at Clark Field, in the Philipp ine Islands. Although I didn't learn the date, I found that there was s uch a record."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"(In the final Project \" Saucer\" report, the attempt t o e xplain away this sighting was painfully evident. Analyzing this case, Number 206, the Air Force said: \"If the facts are correct, there is no astronomical explanation. A few points f avour the daytime meteor hypothesis — snow-white colour, speed faster than a j et, the roar, similarity to sky-writing and the time o f day. But the tactics, if really performed, opp ose it strenu ously: the manoeuvres in and out of cloud ba nks, turns of 180 degrees or more, Possibly these were illusions, caused by seeing the o bject intermittently through clouds. The impression of a fuselage with windows could even more e asily have been a sign of imagination.\" (With this conjecture, Project \" Saucer\" listed the sighting as officially answered. The Hague space-ship c ase was un explained.) In following up the Ja ckson and Bethel reports, I talked with two o fficials in the Civil Aeronautics Administration. One o f these was Charley P lanck, who handled p ublic r elations. I foun d that t he pilots concerned had good records; C.A.A. men who knew them discounted the hoax theory. \"Charley, there's a rumour that airline pilots have been ordered not to talk,\" I told Planck. \"You know anything ab out it?\" \"You mean ordered by the Air Force o r the companies?\" he said. \"The Air Force and the C.A.A.\" \"If the C.A.A.'s in on it, it's a top-level deal,\" said Charley. \"I think it's more likely the companies — with or without a nudge from t he Air Force.\" Wh ile we were talking, an official from another agency came in. Because the lead he gave me was off the record, I'll call him Steve Barrett. I knew Steve fairly well. We were both pilots with service training; our p aths had c rossed during the war, and I saw him now and then at airports aroun d Washington. Wh en the saucer scare first broke, Steve had been disgusted. \"Damn fools trying to get publicity,\" he snorted. \"The way Americans f all for a gag! Even the Air Force has got the jitters.\" So I was a little surpr ised to find he now thought the disks were real. \"Wh at sold you?\" I asked. \"The radar reports,\" said Steve. \"I know of half a dozen cases where they've tracked the things. One was in Japan. The thing was climbing so fast no o ne"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"believed the radarmen at first. Then they g ot some more reports. O ne was up in Canada. There was a case in New Mexico, and I think a Navy destroyer tracked a saucer up in the North Atlantic.\" \"Wh at did they find out?\" said Charley P lanck. Steve shrugged. \"I don't know all the answers. Whatever they are, the things can go like hell.\" I had a hu nch he was holding ba ck. I waited until he had finished with Charley, and then went, down the hall with him. \"You think the saucers are guided missiles?\" I said. \"If I thought so, I wouldn't be talking,\" he said flatly, \"That's not a dig at you. But I was cleared last year for some secret electronics work, and it might be used in some way with guided missiles.\" \"I didn't know that, Steve.\" \"It's O.K. ,\" he said. \"I don't m ind talking, because can't believe the saucers are guided missiles. Maybe few of the things s ighted out in the So uthwest have beer our test rockets, but t hat doesn't explain the radar r eports in Canada a nd Ja pan.\" \"I'd already heard about a radar c ase in Lab rador,\" I told Steve. He looked at me quickly. \"Wh ere'd you pick that up;\" \"True passed it on to me,\" I said. \"They've had some trouble tracking the things, they manoeuvre so fast,\" said Steve. \"It soun ds crazy, but I've been told they hit m ore than ten thousand miles an h our.\" \"You believe it.?\" \"Well, it's not impossible. Those saucers were tracked about fifty miles up, where there's not m uch resistance.\" The e levator d oor opened. Steve waited un til we were o utside o f the Comm erce Building. \"There's one o ther thing that gets me,\" he said. \"Unless the radar boys are"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"way off, some o f those saucers are e normous. I just can't see a guided missile five hu ndred feet in diameter.\" He stopp ed for a moment. \"I supp ose this will soun d screwy to you — \" \"You think they're interplanetary,\" I said. Steve was quickly on the defensive. \"I haven't bought it yet, but it's not as crazy as it sounds.\" Without m entioning names, I told him about t he aircr aft designer and the airline pilots. \"They're in good company,\" said Steve. \"You know the Air Institute?\" \"Sure — the Air Force school down at Montgomery.\" \"Six months ago, I was talking with an officer who'd been instructing there.\" Steve looked at me, deadly serious. \"He told me they are now teaching that the saucers are probably space ships.\" ~"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"CHAPTER IX THREE DAYS after my meeting with Steve Barrett, I was on a Mainliner 300 , starting, a new phase o f the saucer investigation. By the time I returned, I hoped to know the truth about Project \"Saucer.\" As the ship d roned westward, fourteen thousand feet above the Alleghenies, I thought of what Steve had told me. I believed, that he had told me ab out the radar tracking. And I was f airly sure he believed the Air Institute story. But I wasn't so certain the story itself was true. It would hardly be a gag; Steve wasn't easily taken in. It was more likely that one Institute o fficer, or perhaps s everal, believed the saucers were space craft and aired their p ersonal opinions. The Institute wasn't likely to give an official answer to something that Project \"Saucer\" still declared unsolved. If it were possible to get an inside look at Project \"Saucer\" operations, I could soon tell whether it was an actual investigation or a deliberate cover-up for something else. Wh ichever it was, the wall of official. secrecy still hid it. As a formality, I had c alled the Pentagon again and asked to talk with some of the Project officers. As I expected, I was turned d own. The o nly alternative was to dig out t he story by talking with pilots and others who had been. quizzed by P roject t eams. I had several leads, and True had arranged some interviews for me. My first stop was Chicago, w here I met an airline o fficial and two commercial pilots. I saw the pilots f irst. Since they both talked in confidence, I will not use their r ight names. O ne, a Midwesterner I already knew, I'll call Pete Farrell; the o ther, a wartime instructor, Art Green. Pete was about thirty-one, stocky, blue-eyed, w ith a pleasant, intelligent face. Art Green was a little o lder, a lean, sunburned, restless man with an emphatic voice. Pete had served with the Air Force during the war; he was now part owner of a flying school, also a pilot in the Air National Guard. Green was working for an air c harter service We met at the Palmer House. Art Green didn't need much prompting to talk ab out Project \"Saucer.\" After r eporting a disk, seen during a West Coast Right, he had been thoroughly grilled by a Project \"Saucer\" team. \"They practically took me apart,\" he said irritab ly. \"They've got a lot of trick"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"questions. So me o f 'em are figured out to trip up anybody faking a story. The way they worked on me, you'd think I comm itted a murder. \"Then they tried to sell me o n the idea I'd seen a ba lloon, or maybe a plane, with the sun shining on it when it banked. I told them t o go to the devil — I knew w hat I saw. After seventeen years, I've got enough sense to tell a ship or a ba lloon when I see it.\" \"Did they believe you?\" I asked him. \"If they did, they didn't let on. Two o f 'em acted as if they thought I was nu ts. The o ther guy-I think he was Air Force Intelligence — acted d ecent. He said not to get steamed up ab out the Aero-Medical boys; it was their job to screen out the crackpots. \"And on top of that, I foun d out later the F.B.I. had checked up on me to find out if I was a liar or a screwba ll. They went aroun d to my boss, people in my neighbourhood — even the pilots in my outfit. My outfit's still razzing me. I wouldn't report another saucer if one flew through my cockpit.\" Pete Farrell hadn't encoun tered any P roject \" Saucer\" t eams personally, but he had some interesting angles. So me o f the information had c ome from commercial and pr ivate pilots in the Midwest, part of it through National Guard c ontacts. \"I can tell you one thing,\" Pete said. \"Guard pilots got t he same o rder as the Air Force. If we saw anything peculiar flying aroun d, w e were to do o ur damnedest to identify it.\" \"Wh at ab out trying to bring one down? I've heard that was in one o rder.\" Pete hesitated for a second. \"Look, I told you that m uch because it's been in the papers. But I'm still i n the Guard. I can't tell you the o rder itself. It was confidential.\" \"Well, I'm not in the Guard,\" said Art Green. He lit a cigarette, blew out t he match. \"Why don't you look into the Gorman case? Get t he dope o n that court-martial angle.\" I'd heard of the Gorman case, but the court-martial thing was new to me. Gorman, I recalled, w as a fighter pilot in the North Dakota Air National Guard. He had a mystifying encoun ter with a strange, fast-moving \"light\" over Fargo Airport in the fall of 1948 ."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"\"That case is on my list,\" I told Green. \"But I don't remember anything about a court-martial.\" \"It wasn't in the papers. But all the pilots up that way know ab out it. In h is report, G orman said something ab out t rying to ram t he thing. The idea got aroun d that Air Force o rders had said to try this. Anyway, it got into the papers and Gorman almost got court-martialed. If his family hadn't had some influence in the state, the Air Force probab ly would have pushed it.\" \"Are you sure ab out this?\" I said. \"You know how those things build up.\" \"Ask Gorman,\" he said. \"Or ask some o f the pilots at Fargo.\" Before I left t hem, G reen double-checked my report on h is s ighting, w hich Hilton h ad forwarded. As in the majority of cases, he had seen just one disk. It had hovered at a very high altitude, gleaming in the sun , then h ad sudd enly accelerated and r aced off to the north. \"I couldn't tell i ts s ize o r speed,\" said Green. \"But if it was as high as I think, it m ust have been pretty big.\" Pete told me later that Green believed the disk had been at least t wenty miles high, because it was well ab ove clouds at thirty thousand feet. \"It's k ind of hard to believe,\" said Pete. \"The thing would have to be a lot bigger than a B-twenty-nine, and the speed over two thousand miles an hour.\" \"You know w hat they said ab out the Mantell saucer,\" I reminded him. \"So me of the Godman Field p eople said it was at least t hree hun dred feet in diameter.\" \"I've heard it was twice that,\" said Pete. \"You know any Kentucky National Guard p ilots?\" I asked. \"One o r two,\" said Pete. \"But t hey couldn't t ell me anything. It was hushed up too fast.\" That evening I talked with the airline o fficial, w hom I knew w ell enough to call by his first name. I put it to him blun tly. \"Dick, if you're un der orders not t o talk, just tell me. Fm t rying to find out whether Project 'Saucer' has muzzled airline pilots.\""},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"\"You mean the o nes who've sighted things? Perhaps, in a few cases. But m ost of the pilots know w hat happ ened to Captain Emil Smith, on United, and those Eastern pilots. They keep still so they won't be laughed at.

Two o f the reports come pretty straight.\" He made a gesture. \"That could be. I'm not denying that airline pilots — and that includes ours — see these things all the time. They've been sighted on the Se attle-Alaska route, and between Anchorage and Ja pan. I know of s everal saucers that pilots have seen between Honolulu and the mainland. Check with Pan-American — you'll find their p ilots have seen them, too.\" \"Wh at happ ens to those reports?\" \"They g o to Operations,\" said Dick. \"Of course, if something really important happ ens, the pilot m ay radio the tower before he lands. Then the C.A.A. gets word to the Air Force, and they rush some Intelligence o fficers to quiz the pilots. if it's not t oo hot, they'd c ome from Wright Field — regular Project 'Saucer' teams. O therwise, they'd send the nearest Intelligence o fficers to take o ver temporarily.\" I asked him if he had ever been in on one o f thee sessions. Dick s aid he hadn't. \"But a couple o f pilots talked to me later. They said these Air Force men seemed quite upset about it; they pounced on everything these boys s aid ab out the thing's app earance — how it m anoeuvred and so o n.\" \"Wh at do your p ilots think the saucers are?\" Dick gave me a slightly ironic grin. \"Wh y ask me? Captain Blake says you've been getting it firsthand.\" \"I wasn't pulling a fast one,\" I protested. \"We're not going to quote actual names or sources, un less people. O.K . it.\" \"Sure, I know that,\" said Dick. \"But you've got t he answer already. So me pilots s ay interplanetary, some say guided missiles. A few — a very few — still think it's all nonsense, because they haven't seen any.\" \"Wh at do you think?\""},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"\"I don't know the answer,\" said Dick, \"but I'm positive o f one thing. Either the Air Force is s itting on a b ig secret, or they're ba dly scared because they don't know the answer.\" During the next week or so, I covered several northwest and moun tain states. Although I was chiefly trying to find out ab out Project \"Saucer,\" I ran onto two sightings that were not on my list. One o f these had occurred in California, at Fairfield Suisan Air Force Base. A Se attle man who had been stationed there gave me the details. It was on the night of December 1918 , w ith unu sually high winds s weeping across the airfield. At times the gusts reached almost seventy miles an h our. Sudd enly a weird ba ll of light flashed into view, at a height of a thousand feet. As the men on the ba se watched it, astonished, the mysterious light abruptly shot skyward. In an incredibly short t ime, it reached an altitude o f twenty thousand feet and vanished. \"Was there any shape o utlined behind the light?\" I asked the Se attle man. \"Nobody saw any,\" he replied. \"It looked just like I said — a ba ll of light, going like a streak.\" \"Did it leave any smoke behind it?\" \"You mean like an engine, or a j et?\" He shook his head. \"Not a thing. And it didn't m ake a soun d — even when it shot up like that.\" \"Did you h ear any g uesses ab out it, or r eports later on?\" \"So me major who didn't see it said it m ust have been a ba lloon. Anybody with brains could see that was s crewy. No balloon ever went up that fast — and besides, the thing was going against the wind.\" The second incident occurred at Salmon Dam, Idaho, on August 13 , 1947 . Wh en I heard the date, it soun ded familiar. I checked my sightings file and saw it was the same day as the strange affair at Twin Falls, Idaho. In the Twin Falls case, the disk was sighted by observers in a canyon. There was one interesting difference from t he usual description. This disk was sky-blue, or else its gleaming surface somehow reflected the sky because o f the angle o f vision. Although it was not close to the treetops, the o bservers were amazed to see the trees whip violently when the disk raced overhead, as though the air was boiling from the o bject's s wift passage."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"At Salmon Dam, that same day, two miners heard an odd r oaring sound and stared into the sky. Se veral miles away, two brightly gleaming disks were circling at high speed. \"It was like two roun d mirrors whirling aroun d the sky,\" one o f the men was later quoted as s aying. \"They couldn't have been any ordinary planes; not roun d like that. And they were going too fast.\" During this part of my trip, I also was told that one saucer had fallen into a moun tain lake. This came to me secondhand. The lone witness was s aid to have rushed over to his car to get his camera a s the disk appr oached. Wh en it plun ged toward the lake, he was s o startled that he failed to snap the picture un til the moment it struck. This s tory soun ded so flimsy that I didn't bother to list it. Months later, a Washington n ewsman confirmed at least part of the lake story. Wh en h e first related it, I thought he had fallen for a gag. \"I heard that yarn,\" I said. \"Don't tell me you believe it?\" \"I come from Idaho,\" he told me. \"And I happen to know the fellow w ho took the picture. Maybe it wasn't a disk, but something fell i nto that lake.\" \"Did you see the picture?\" \"Yes, at the Pentagon.\" At m y surpr ised look, he add ed, \"That was long before they clamped d own. I was talking to an Air Force officer ab out this lake thing, and he showed me the picture.\" \"Wh at did it look like?\" \"You couldn't tell much ab out it-just a b ig splash and a b lur where something went under. Maybe a magnifying g lass would bring it out, but I didn't get a chance to try it.\" It was early in 1950 when h e told me this. I asked at the Pentagon if this picture was in the Wright Field files, and if s o whether I could see it. My inquiries drew blank looks. No o ne remembered such a photograph. And even if it were in the Project \"Saucer\" files, I couldn't see it. This was more than two months after Project \"Saucer\" had been officially closed and its s ecrets presumab ly all revealed."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"The rest of my interviews during this 1949 trip helped to roun d out m y picture o f Project \"Saucer\" operations. So me witnesses s eemed afraid to talk; a few flatly refused. I foun d no proof of official pressure, but I frequently had the feeling that strong hints had been dropp ed. Though one o r two witnesses s howed r esentment at investigators' methods, most of them seemed more ann oyed at t he loss of time involved. O ne man had been checked first by the police, then by the sheriff's office; an Air Force team had spent hours questioning him, returning the next day, and finally the F.B.I. had made a character check. Wh at he told me ab out the Air Force interrogation confirmed one o f Art Green's statements. \"One Intelligence captain tried to tell me I'd seen a weather ba lloon. I called up the airport and had them check on release schedules. They said next day it didn't fit any schedules aroun d this area. Anyway, the wind wasn't right, because the thing I saw w as cutting into the wind at a forty-five-degree angle.\" Other witnesses told me that investigators had suggested birds, meteors, reflections on clouds, shooting stars, and starshells as probable e xplanations of what they had seen. I learned of one pilot who had been startled by seeing a group of disks racing past his plane. Air Force investigators later suggested that he had flown through a flock of birds, or p erhaps a cluster of ba lloons, On the flight ba ck to Washington, I reread all the information the Air Force had r eleased on Project \"Saucer.\" Sudd enly a familiar p hrase caught my eye. I read over the paragraph again: \"Preliminary study of the more than 24 0 domestic and thirty foreign incidents by Astro-Physicist Hynek indicates that an over-all total of ab out 30 % can probab ly be e xplained away as astronomical phenomena.\" Explained away. I went through the report line by line. O n page 17 I found this: \"Availab le preliminary reports now indicate that a great nu mber of sightings can be e xplained away as ordinary occurrences which h ave been misrepresented as a result of human errors.\""},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"On page 22 I ran onto another use o f the phrase: \"The o bvious explanation for most of the spherical-shaped objects reported, as already mentioned, is that t hey are meteorological or similar type ba lloons. This, however, does not explain reports that they travel at high speed or manoeuvre rapidly. But 'Saucer' men point out t hat t he movement could be explained away as an optical ill usion or actual acceleration of the balloon caused by a gas leak and later exaggerated by observers. . . . There are scores of possible e xplanations for the scores of different type sightings reported.\" Explained away . . . It m ight not m ean anything. It could be just an un fortun ate choice o f words. But suppose that t he real mission of Project \"Saucer\" was to cover up something. Or that its purpose was to investigate something serious, at t he same time covering it up, step by step. The Project \"Saucer\" t eams, then, w ould c heck on reports and simultaneously try to divert attention from t he truth, suggesting v arious answers to e xplain the sightings. Back at Wright Field, analysts and Intelligence o fficers would go over the general picture and try to work up p lausible e xplanations, w hich, if necessary, could even be published. \"Explaining away\" would be o ne o f the main purposes of Project personn el. These words would pr obab ly be used in discussions of ways and means; they would un doubtedly would be used in secret official papers. And since this published preliminary report had been made up from censored secret files, the use o f those familiar words might have been overlooked, since, read casually, they would app ear harmless. If the report had been thrown together hastily, the use o f these telltale words could be e asily un derstood, and so could the report's strange contradictions. As an experiment, I fixed the idea firmly in mind that Project \"Saucer\" was a cover-up un it. Then I went ba ck once more and r ead the items quoted ab ove. The e ffect was almost startling. It was as though I were reading confidential suggestions for d iverting attention and explaining away the sightings; suggestions made by P roject members and pr obab ly circulated for c omment. \"Now, w ait a minu te,\" I said to myself. \"You may be dreaming up this whole thing.\" Trying to get ba ck to a neutral viewpoint, I skimm ed through the o ther details of Project operations, as described in the report."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"The o rder c reating Project \" Saucer\" was s igned on December 30, 194 7.

On Janu ary 22 , 1948 , two weeks after Captain Mantell's death, the project officially began operations. (Preliminary investigation at Godman Field had been done by local Intelligence o fficers.) Project \" Saucer\" was set up un der the Air M ateriel Comm and at Wright Field. Contracts were made with an astrophysicist (Professor Joseph Hynek), also a prominent scientist (still un identified), and a group of evaluation experts (Rand Corporation). Arrangements were made for services by the Air Weather Se rvice, Andrews Field; the U. S. Weather Bureau; the Electronics Lab oratory, Cambridge Field Station; the A.M.C. Aero-Medical Laboratory; the Army and Navy Departments; the F.B.I.; the Departm ent of Comm erce, Civil Aeronautics Administration; and various other government and p rivate agencies.

Generally, the flying objects are divided into four groups: Flying disks , torpedo o r c igar-shaped bodies with n o wings or fins visible in flight, spherical or ba lloon-shaped objects and ba lls of light. The first three groups are capab le o f flight by aerodynamic or aerostatic means and can be propelled and c ontrolled by methods k nown to aeronautical engineers. As for the lights, their actions — un less they were suspended from a higher object or were the product of hallucination — remain un explained. Eventually, reports are sent ba ck to Project \" Saucer\" headquarters, often marking incidents closed. The project, however, is a young one-much of its investigation is s till un der way.

Meteors. Balloons. Falling stars. Birds in flight. Testing devices, etc. So me o f them still end in question marks.\" From what I had learned on this trip, I strongly doubted the answer suggested. All but the \"testing devices.\" Wh at did they mean by that? It could be a hint at guided missiles; they had already mentioned guided-missile research activity in another spot. But if that was what lay behind this elaborate project, they would hardly be hinting at it. If the answer was s pace travel, then such h ints made sense, They would be part of the cover-up p lan.

Dear Don: The Mantell and Eastern cases both look good. I don't see how they can brush them off. It looks more like the interplanetary answer to me, but we won't decide o n treatm ent un til we're sure. [I had suggested two o r three angles, if this proved the real answer.] Wh o would be the best authority to check our d isk operation theory and give us more details on directional control? I'd like to have it checked by two more e ngineers. KEN Next day, I dug out m y copy of Boal's interview w ith D----- , the famous aircr aft designer. \"Certainly the flying saucers are possible,\" t he designer had told Boal. \"Give me e nough money and I'll build you one. It m ight have to be a model because the fuel would be a problem. If the saucers that have been seen came from other worlds, w hich isn't at all Buck Rogerish, they may be powered with atomic energy or by the e nergy that produces cosmic rays — which is many times more powerful — or by some o ther fuel or natural force that our research hasn't yet discovered. But the circular airfoil is quite feasible. \"It wouldn't have the stab ility of the conventional airplane, but it would have enormous manoeuvrab ility — it could r ise vertically, hover, descend vertically, and fly at extremely high speed, w ith the proper power. D on't t ake my word for it. Check with other engineers.\" Before looking up a private e ngineer I had in mind, I went t o the National Advisory Comm ittee for Aeronautics. The N.A.C.A. {the predecessor of NASA — jbh} is America's most authoritative source o f aerodynamic knowledge. I knew they had already tried out disk-s haped airfoils, and I asked ab out t his first. I foun d that two o fficial N .A.C.A. reports, Technical Note 53 9 and Report 431 , discuss tests on circular and elliptical Clark Y airfoils. Both reports s tate that these designs were foun d pr actical. Later, I talked with one o f the top engineers in the N.A.C.A. Without showing"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"him D----- -'s sk etch, I asked how a disk might operate. \"It could be built with variable-direction jet or r ocket nozzles,\" be said. \"The nozzles would be placed around the rim, and by changing their direction the disk could be made to rise and d escend vertically. It could hover, fly straight ahead, and make sharp turns. \"Its direction and velocity would be governed by the nu mber of nozzles operating, the power app lied, and the angle at which they were tilted. They could be pointed toward the ground, rearward, in a lateral direction, or in various combinations. \"A disk flying level, straight ahead, could be turned swiftly to right or left by shifting the angles of the nozzles or c utting off power from part of the group. This method of control would operate in the e arth's atmosphere and also, using rocket power, in free space, w here conventional controls would be useless.\" The method he had d escribed was not the o ne which D------ had outlined. \"Wh at ab out a rotating disk?\" I asked the N.A.C.A. man. \"Suppose you h ad one with a stationary centre, and a large circular section rotating around it? The rotating part would have a camber built into it, or it would have slotted vanes.\" He gave me a curious look, \"Wh ere'd you get that idea a bout the camber?\" I told him it had c ome to me from True. \"It could be done,\" he said. \"The slotted-vanes method has already been tried. There's an engineer in Glendale, California, w ho's built a model. His name's E. W. K ay.\" He gave me a few details on how a cambered or slotted-vane rotating disk might operate, then interrupted himself to ask me what I thought the saucers were. \"They're e ither interplanetary or some secret development,\" I said. 'Wh at do you think?\" \"The N.A.C.A. has no proof they even exist,\" he answered. Wh en I left the building a few minu tes later, I was still weighing that statement. If the Air Force o r the Navy had a secret disk device, the N.A.C.A."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"would almost certainly know about it. The chances were that any disk-s haped missile o r new type o f circular aircr aft would first have been tested in the N.A.C.A. w ind tunn els at Langley Field.

Either way, the N.A.C.A.'s official attitude could be e xpected to match the Pentagon's. After lun ch, I took a taxi to the o ffice o f the private e ngineer. Like D------ , he has asked that he not be quoted by name. The name I am using, Paul Redell, will serve that purpose. Redell i s a well-known aeronautical engineer. He has worked with major aircraft companies and served as a special consultant t o government agencies and the industries. He is also a competent pilot. Although I had known him several years, he refused at first to talk about the saucers. Then I realized he thought I meant to quote him. I showed him some of the material I had r oughed out, in which n ames were o mitted or changed as requested. \"All right,\" Redell said finally. \"Wh at do you want to know?\" \"Anything y ou can tell us. But first, your ideas on these sketches.\" I showed him D------ 's drawings and then gave him the high points of the investigation. Wh en I mentioned the mystery-light incident at Fairfield Suisan Air Force Base, Redell sat up quickly. \"The Gorman case again!\" \"We heard ab out some o ther 'light' cases,\" I said. \"One was at Las Vegas.\" \"I know ab out that one. That is, it you mean the green light — wait a minu te!\" Redell frowned into space for a few seconds, \"You say that Fairfield Suisan sighting was on December third? Then the Las Vegas s ighting was only a few days later. It was the first week of the month, I'm positive.\" \"Those light reports have got m e stumped,\" I said. \"A light just can't fly aroun d by itself. And those two-foot disks — \" \"You h aven't worked on the Gorman case?\" asked Redell. I told him I hadn't thought it was coming up on my schedule. \"Leave these sketches here,\" he said. \"Look into that Gorman sighting. Then check on our p lans for space e xploration. I'll give you some sources. Wh en you get through, come o n ba ck and we'll talk it over.\""},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"The Gorman \"saucer d ogfight\" had been described in newspapers; the pilot had r eported c hasing a swiftly manoeuvring white light, which had finally escaped him. Judging from t he Project \"Saucer\" preliminary report, this case had baffled all the Air Force investigators. Wh en I met George Gorman, I foun d him t o be intelligent, coolheaded, and very firmly convinced of every detail i n h is s tory. I had learned something ab out his ba ckground. He had had c ollege training. D uring the war, he had been an Air Force instructor, training F rench student pilots. In Fargo, his home, he had a good r eputation, not only for veracity but as a b usinessman. O nly twenty-six, he was part owner of a construction company, and also the Fargo representative for a hardware-store chain. Even knowing all this, I foun d it hard at first to believe some o f the dogfight details. But t he groun d observers confirmed them. It was ab out nine o 'clock in the e vening, O ctober 1, 19 48. G orman, now an Air National Guard lieutenant, had been on a practice flight in an F-51 fighter. The o ther p ilots on this practice patrol had already landed. G orman had just been cleared by the C.A.A. operator in the Fargo Airport tower when he saw a fast-moving light below his circling fighter. From his altitude, 4,50 0 feet, it app eared to be the tail li ght of a swiftly flying plane. As nearly as he could tell, it was 1,000 feet high, moving at ab out 250 m.p.h. Gorman called the tower to recheck his clearance. He was told the o nly other plane in the area was a Piper Cub. G orman Could see the Cub plainly outlined below him. There was a night footba ll game going on, and the field was brightly lighted. But the Cub was nowhere near the strange light. As the mystery light raced ab ove the footba ll field. G orman n oticed an odd phenomenon. Instead of s eeing the silhouette o f a plane, he saw no shape at all aroun d the light. By contrast, he could see the Cub's outline clearly. Meantime, the airport t raffic c ontroller, L. D. Jensen, had also spotted the queer light. Concerned with the danger of collision — he said later that he, too, thought it a plane's tail li ght — he trained his binoculars on it. Like Gorman, he was un ab le to distinguish a shape near the light. Neither c ould another C.A.A. man who was with h im in the tower, a Fargo resident named Manu el E. Johnson. Up in the F-51 , G orman dived on the light, w hich was steadily blinking on"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"and off. \"As I closed in,\" he told Project \"Saucer\" men later, \"it sudd enly became steady and p ulled up into a sharp left t urn. It was a clear white and completely roun dabout six to e ight inches in diameter. \"I thought it was making a pass at the tower. I dived after it and brought m y manifold pr essure up to sixty, but I couldn't catch the thing.\" Gorman reported his s peed at full power as 350 to 400 miles per hour. D uring the manoeuvres that followed, both the C.A.A. men watched from t he tower. Jensen was using powerful night glasses, but still no shape was visible near the mysterious light. The fantastic d ogfight continu ed for twenty minutes. Gorman described it in detail. \"Wh en I attempted to turn with the light, I blacked out temporarily, owing to excessive speed. I am in fairly g ood physical condition, and I don't believe there are many, if any, pilots who could withstand the turn and speed effected by the light and r emain conscious.\" During these sharp manoeuvers, the light climbed quickly, then made another left ba nk. \"I put m y fifty-one into a sharp turn and tried to cut it off,\" said Gorman. \"By then we were at about seven thousand feet, Sudd enly it m ade a sharp right turn and we headed straight at each other. Just when we were ab out to collide I g uess I lost m y nerve. I went into a dive and the light passed over my canopy at ab out five hun dred feet. Then it m ade a left circle about one thousand feet ab ove and I g ave chase again.\" Wh en collision seemed imm inent a second time, the o bject shot straight into the air. G orman climbed after it at full throttle. Just ab out this time, two. other witnesses, a private pilot and his passenger, saw the fast-moving light. The pilot was Dr. A. D. Cann on, an oculist; his passenger was Einar Nelson. D r. Cann on later told investigators the light was moving at high speed. He thought it m ight be a Canadian jet fighter from over the border. (A careful check with Canadian air officials ruled out this answer.) After landing at t he airport, D r. Cann on and Mr . Nelson again watched the light, saw it change direction and d isappear. Meanwhile, G orman was making desperate e fforts to catch the thing. He was now determined to ram it, since there seemed nothing solid behind it to cause a dangerous crash. If his f ighter was disabled, or if it caught fire, he could"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"ba il out. But despite the F-51 's fast climb, the light still outdistanced him. At 14,000 feet, G orman's plane went into a power stall, He made o ne last try, climbing up to 17 ,000 feet. A few moments later, the light turned in a north-northwest direction and quickly disapp eared. Throughout t he dogfight, Gorman noticed no deviation on h is instruments, according to the Project \"Saucer\" report. Gorman did not confirm or d eny this when I talked with h im. But he did agree with the rest of the Project statement. He did not notice any sound, odour, or exhaust trail. Gorman's remarks ab out ramming the light reminded me o f what Art Green had said. Wh en I asked Gorman ab out the court-martial rumour, he gave me a searching g lance. \"Wh ere did you h ear that?\" \"Se veral places,\" I told him. \"At Chicago, in Salt Lake City — in fact, w e've been hearing it all over.\" \"Well, there's nothing to it,\" Gorman declared. He changed the subject. So me time afterward, a Fargo pilot t old me there had been trouble o ver the ramm ing story. \"But it wasn't Gorman's fault. So mebody else released that report to the A. P. The news s tory didn't actually say there was an Air Force o rder to ram it, but the idea got aroun d, and we heard that Washington squawked. Gorman had a pretty rough time o f it for a while. So me o f the newspapers razzed his s tory. And the Project 'Saucer' teams really worked on h im. I guess they were trying to scare him into saying he was mistaken, and it was a balloon.\" Wh en I asked Gorman ab out this, he denied he'd had r ough treatm ent by the Project teams. \"Sure, they asked ab out a thousand questions, and I could tell they thought it might be a hoax at first. But that was before they quizzed the o thers who saw it.\" \"Anybody suggest it was a balloon?\" I said c asually. \"At first, they were sure that's what it was,\" answered Gorman. \"You see, there was a weather ba lloon released here. You know the kind, it has a"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"lighted c andle o n it. The Project t eams s aid I'd c hased after that candle and just imagined the light's manoeuvers — confused it with my own movement, because o f the dark.\" Gorman grinn ed. \"They had it just ab out wrapp ed up — un til they talked to George S anderson. He's the weather observer. He was tracking the ba lloon with a theodolite, and he showed them his records. The time and altitudes didn't fit, and the wind d irection was wrong. The ba lloon was drifting in the opp osite direction. Both the tower men backed him up. So that killed the weather-ba lloon idea.\" The next step by P roject \" Saucer\" investigators had been to look f or some un identified aircraft. This failed, too. O bviously, it was only routine; the outline o f a conventional plane would c ertainly have been seen by Gorman and the men in the tower. An astronomical check by Professor Hynek ruled out stars, fireba lls, and comets — a vain h ope, to begin with. The o nly other c onventional answer, as the Project report later stated, was hallucination. In view of all the testimony, hallucination h ad to he ruled out. Finally, the investigators admitted they had no solution. The first Project \"Saucer\" report, on April 27 , 194 9, left the Gorman \"m ystery light\" un identified. In the Saturday Evening Post of May 7, 194 9, Sidney Shallett analysed the Gorman case, in the second of his articles on flying saucers. Shallet suggested this s olution: that Gorman h ad c hased one o f the Navy's giant cosmic-ray research ba lloons. Each of these huge ba lloons is lighted, so that night-flying planes will not collide with the gas ba g or the instrument case suspended below. Shallett concluded that Gorman was suffering from a combination of vertigo and confusion with the light on the balloon. As already mentioned, these hu ge Navy balloons are filled with only a small amoun t of helium before their r elease at Minn eapolis. They then rise swiftly to very high altitudes, un less a leak develops. In Shallett's words, \"These ba lloons travel high and fast. . . .\" Fargo is ab out t wo hu ndred miles f rom Minn eapolis. Normally, a cosmic-ray research ba lloon would have reached a very high altitude by the time it had drifted this far. The o nly possible answer to its low-altitude sighting would be a serious leak. If a leaking balloon had come down to o ne thousand feet at Fargo, it would"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"either have remained at that height or kept on descending. The mystery light was observed at t his altitude moving at high speed. If a Cub's outline was visible against t he lighted footba ll field, the massive shape o f even a partly deflated ba lloon would have stood out like an elephant. Even before release, the partially inflated gas ba gs are almost a hu ndred feet t all. The crowd at the footba ll game would c ertainly have seen such a monstrous shape ab ove the glare o f the floodlights, for the plastic ba lloons gleam brightly in any light rays. The two C.A.A. men, w atching with binoculars, could not possibly have missed it. For the cosmic-ba lloon answer to be correct, this leaking g as bag would have had to rise swiftly to seventeen thousand feet — after a loss of helium had forced it down to o ne thousand. As a ba lloon pilot, I know this is impossible. The Project \"Saucer\" report said un equivocally: \"The o bject could outturn and outspeed the F-51 , and was ab le to attain a much steeper c limb a nd to maintain a constant rate o f climb far in excess of the Air Force fighter.\" A leaking ba lloon? M ore and more, I became convinced that Se cretary Forrestal had p ersuaded some e ditors that it was their p atriotic d uty to conceal the answer, whatever it was. That t hought had begun to worry me, because o f my part in this investigation. Perhaps John Steele had been right, and we shouldn't be trying to dig out the answer. But I had already told Purdy, and he had agreed, that if national security was involved, w e would dr op the thing completely. By the time I had pr oved the ba lloon answer wrong, I was ba dly puzz led. The idea of a disembodied light was the hardest t hing to swallow that I'd c ome across s o far. And yet t here were the o ther light reports — the strange sighting at Fairfield Suisan Field, the weird green lights at Las Vegas and Albuquerque. And there was the e ncoun ter that Lieutenant H. G. Combs had had one night ab ove Andrews Field, near Washington, D. C. This incident had occurred on November 18 , 1948 , six weeks after Gorman's experience. Combs, flying with another lieutenant named Ja ckson, w as about to land his T-6, at 9:45 P.M., when a strange o bject loomed up near him. It looked like a greyish globe, and it gave o ff an odd , fuzzy light. Combs chased the weird object for over ten minu tes, during which it app eared to e vade e very move he made. O nce, its s peed was nearly six hun dred miles an hour, as closely as he could estimate. In a final attempt t o"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"identify it, Combs zoomed the T-6 up at a steep angle and flashed his landing lights on it. Before he could get a good look, the globe light whirled off to the east and vanished. Since Combs's story had been in the newspapers, Project \" Saucer\" evidently had felt in wise to give some e xplanation. Wh en I read it, in the preliminary report, I was amazed. Here was the concluding sentence: \"The mystery was cleared up when the o bject was identified positively as a cluster of cosmic-ray research ba lloons.\" Even one o f the giant ba lloons would have been h ard to take as the explanation. Combs was almost sure to have collided with it in h is head-on passes. But an entire cluster! I tried to picture the T-6 zooming and twisting through the night sky, w ith several huge balloons in its path. It would be a miracle if Combs got through without hitting one o f them, even if each ba lloon was lighted. But he had seen only one light; so had Lieutenant Ja ckson. That would mean all the rest of the balloons were un lighted — an un believab le coincidence. It was not un til months afterward that I foun d Project \"Saucer\" had withdrawn this \"solution.\" In its f inal report, this case, Number 20 7, w as listed in the \"Unidentified\" group. How the ba lloon-cluster explanation ever got into the first report is still a mystery. Wh en I talked with Gorman, I told him I was ba ffled by the idea of a light manoeuvering through the skies with no airfoil to supp ort it. \"I know,\" he said. \"It got m e, too, at first.\" \"You mean you know the answer?\" I demanded. \"It's just m y personal opinion,\" said Gorman. \"But I'd rather not have it printed. You see, I g ot some ideas f rom all the questions those Project teams asked me. If my hun ch turns out t o be right, I might be talking ab out an official secret.\" I tried to pry some hint out of him, but Gorman just smiled and shook his head. \"I can tell you this much,\" he said, \"because it's been mentioned in print. There was thought behind every move the light made. It wasn't any radar-responder gadget m aking it veer away from m y ship.\""},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"\"How do you know that?\" \"Because it reacted d ifferently at different times. If it had been a mechanical control, it would have turned or c limbed the same way each time I g ot near it. Instead, it was as if s ome intelligent mind was directing every turn like a game o f chess, and always one move ahead of me. Maybe you can figure o ut the rest.\" That was all I could get out of him. It bothered me, because Combs's report indicated the same thing. I had a strong temptation to skip the space-plans research and tell Redell what Gorman had told me. But Redell had an orderly mind, and he didn't like to be pushed. Reluctantly, I g ave up the idea. I had a feeling Redell knew the answer to the mystery lights, and it wasn't easy to put off the solution. The letter that came from Art Green, w hile I was working on the space plans, didn't m ake it easier: Dear Keyhoe: Just heard ab out your Se attle visit. That Fairfield Suisan thing is on the level; several Air Force pilots have told me ab out it. Wh en you get t o Fargo, ask Gorman what t hey foun d when they checked his s hip with a Geiger coun ter. If he says it was negative, then h e must be un der orders. I happ en to know better. Yours,  AR T GREE N ~"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"CHAPTER XI MY FIRST STEP, in checking on our space plans, w as to look up official ann ouncements. I foun d that on December 29 , 19 48, D efense Se cretary Ja mes Forrestal had r eleased this official statement: \"The Earth Satellite Vehicle Program, w hich is being carried out independently by each military service, has been assigned to the Comm ittee on Guided M issiles for co-ordination. \"To provide an integrated pr ogram, the Comm ittee has recommended that current efforts be limited to studies and c omponent design. Well-defined areas of s uch research h ave been allocated to e ach of the three military departments.\" Appr opriation bills had already provided funds f or space e xploration plans. The Air Force research was indicated by General Curtis E. LeMay, w ho was then Deputy Chief of Air Staff f or Research and Development. In outlining plans f or an Air Engineering Design Center at Wright Field, G eneral LeMay included these space-exploration requisites: \"Flight and survival equipment for ultra-atm ospheric operations, including space vehicles, space bases, and d evices for use therein.\" The idea of exploring space is, of course, nothing new. For many y ears, writers of imaginative fiction have described trips to the moon and d istant planets. More recently, comic books and strips have gone in h eavily for space-travel adventures. As a natural result of this, the first serious rocket experiments in this coun try were lab eled screwball stun ts, ab out on a par with efforts to break through the sonic ba rrier. The latter had been \"proved\" impossible by aeronautical engineers; as f or rocket flight, it was too silly for serious consideration. Pendray, G odd ard, and other r ocket pioneers took s ome vicious ridicule before America woke up to the possibilities. Meantime, G erman scientists had gone far ahead. Their buzz bomb, a low-altitude semi-guided missile, w as just the beginn ing. Even the devastating V-2, w hich soared high into the stratosphere before falling on England, w as just a step in their tremendous s pace program. If the Nazis could have hun g on a year or two more, the war might have had a"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"grimly different ending. Wh en the Allies seized Nazi secrets, some o f the German plans were revealed. Among them was one for a hu ge e arth satellite. From this ba se, which would c ircle the e arth some five hun dred miles away, enormous mirrors would focus the sun 's rays on any desired spot. The result: swift, fiery destruction of any city or ba se refusing to surrender. First publication of this s cheme brought t he usual jeers. Many people, including some reputable scientists, believed it had been just a propaganda plan that even Goebbels had d iscarded as hopeless. Then the Pentagon announ ced the U.S. Earth Satellite Vehicle Program, along with plans f or a moon rocket, The artificial satellite is to be a large rocket-propelled pr ojectile. In its upward flight, it will have to reach a speed of 23 ,000 miles an hour, to e scape the e arth's pull of gravity. At a height of ab out 500 miles, special controls will turn the projectile and c ause it to circle the e arth. These controls will be e ither automatic or operated from the groun d, by radar. Theoretically, once such a vehicle is beyond gravity's magnetism, it can coast along in the sky forever. Its rocket power will be shut off; the o nly need for such power would be if the satellite veered off course. A momentary burst from the jets would be sufficient to bring it back to its orbit. Circling the e arth in ab out two hours, this f irst satellite is expected to be used as a testing station. Instruments will record and transmit vital information to the e arth — the e ffect of cosmic r ays, solar r adiation, fuel required for c ourse corrections, and many other items. A second space ba se farther out will proba bly be the next step. It m ay be mann ed, or it m ay be un der r emote control li ke the first. Perhaps the first satellite vehicle will be followed by a compartm ented operating ba se, a sort of aerial aircr aft carrier, w ith other rocket ships operating to and fro o n the earth shu ttle. The moon rocket is expected to add to o ur information ab out space, so that finally we will emerge with an interplanetary space craft. The first attempts may fail. The first satellite may fall ba ck and have to be guided to an ocean landing. O r its controls might not bring it into the plann ed orbit. In this case, it could c oast on out into space and be lost. But sooner or later, effective controls will be found. Then the manned space ships will follow. Once in free space, there will be no gravitational pull to o ffs et. The space ship and everything in it will be weightless. Shielding is expected to prevent danger from cosmic rays and solar r adiation."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"The danger from meteorites has been partly discoun ted in one scientific study. (\"Probab ility that a meteorite will hit or penetrate a b ody situated in the vicinity of the e arth,\" by G. G rimm inger, Journal of App lied Physics, Vol. 19 , No. 10 , pp . 947 -956 , October 1948 ) In this s tudy, it is s tated that a meteorite is unlikely to penetrate the thick s hell our space vehicles will un doubtedly have. However, this app lies only to the e arth's atm osphere. Longer studies, using remote-controlled vehicles in space, may take years before it will be safe to laun ch a mann ed space ship. Radar or other d evices may have to be developed to detect appr oaching meteorites at a distance and automatically change a space ship's course. The change required would be infinitesimal, using power for only a fraction of a second. But before we are ready for interplanetary travel, w e will have to harness atomic p ower or some o ther force not now availab le, such as cosmic rays. Navigation at such tremendous s peeds is another great problem, on which special groups are now at work. A Navy scientific pr oject recently found that strange radio signals are constantly being sent out from a \"hot spot\" in the Milky Way; other nebulae o r \"hot\" stars may be similarly identified by some peculiarity in their r adio e manations. If s o, these could be used as check points in long-range space travel. Escape from the e arth's gravity is possible e ven n ow, according to Francis H . Clauser, an authority on space travel plans. But t he cost would be prohibitive, with our present rocket m otors, and pr actical operations must wait for higher velocity rocket power, atomic or otherwise. (\"Flight beyond the Earth's Atm osphere, \"S.A.E. Q uarterly Transactions, Vol. 2, No, 4, October 1948 .) Already, a two-stage rocket has gone more than 250 miles ab ove the e arth. This is the V-2-Wac Corporal combination. The V-2 rocket is used to power the first part of the flight, dropp ing off when its f uel is exhausted. The Wac Corporal then proceeds on its own fuel, reaching a fantastic speed in the thin air higher up. Hun dreds of techn ical problems must be licked before the first satellite vehicle can be laun ched successf ully. Records on our V-2 rockets indicate some o f the o bstacles. O n the take-off, their present swift acceleration would un doubtedly kill anyone inside. Wh en re-entering the e arth's atmosphere the nose o f a V-2 gets red-hot. Both the acceleration and d eceleration must be controlled before the first volun teers will be allowed to hazard their lives in manned r ockets.

(Two o f his books, Rockets and Space Travel and Outer Space, give fascinating and well-thought-out pictures of what we may expect in years to come.) So me authorities believe that our space travel will be confined to o ur own solar system for a long time, perhaps f orever. The trip to the moon, though now a tremendous project, w ould be relatively simple compared with a journey outside o ur system. Escape from the moon, for the return trip, w ould be e asier than leaving the e arth; because o f its s maller mass, to e scape the moon's gravitational pull would take a speed of ab out 5,000 miles an h our, against 23 ,000 for the e arth. Navigation would be much simpler. O ur globe would loom up in the heavens, much larger and brighter than the moon app ears to us. Radar beams would also be a guide. The greatest obstacle to reaching far-distant planet is the time required. In the Project \" Saucer\" study of space travel, Wolf 359 was named as the nearest star likely to have possibly inh ab ited areas. Wolf 359 is eight light-years f rom t he e arth. The limiting speed in space, according to Einstein's law, w ould be just un der the speed of light — 186 ,000 miles per second. At this s peed, Einstein states, matter is converted into e nergy. It is a ridiculous assumption, but even if atomic p ower, or some force such as cosmic rays, made an appr oach to that speed p ossible, it would still take e ight years to reach W olf 35 9. The roun d trip would take sixteen. There have been a few scientists who dispute Einstein's law, though no o ne has disproved it. If the speed of light is not an ab solute limit for space ships, then travel to remote parts of the un iverse may someday be possible. Otherwise, a trip outside o ur solar system could be a lifetime e xpedition. Most space travel would pr obab ly be limited to the planets of our sun — the moon, Mars, Venus, Jupiter, and the o thers. Although it m ay be many y ears before the first mann ed space ship leaves the earth, w e are already at work on the problems the crews would face. I learned some o f the details from a Navy flight surgeon with whom I had talked ab out take-off problems. \"They're a lot further than that\" he told me. \"Down at Randolph Field, the Aero-Medical research lab has run into some mighty queer things. Ever hear of 'dead d istance'?\" \"No, that's a new one.\" \"Well, it sounds crazy, but t hey've figured out that a space ship would be"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"going faster than anyone could think.\" \"But you think instantaneously,\" I objected. \"Oh, no. It takes a fraction of a second, even for the fastest thinker. Let's s ay the ship was making a hun dred miles a second — and that's s low compared with what they expect eventually. Everything would happ en faster than your nerve impulses could r egister it. Your c omprehension would always be lagging a split second behind the space ship's operation.\" \"I don't see why that's so serious,\" I said. \"Supp ose radar or some o ther d evice warned you a meteorite was coming toward you h ead-on. O r maybe some instrument indicated an error in navigation. By the time your mind r egistered the thought, the situation would have changed.\" \"Then all the controls would have to be automatic,\" I said. I told him t hat I had heard ab out plans f or avoiding meteorites. \"Electronic controls would be faster than thought.\" \"That's probab ly the answer,\" he agreed. \"Of course, at a hun dred miles a second it m ight not be too serious. But if they ever get up to speeds like a thousand miles a second, that mental lag could make an enormous difference, whether it was a meteorite heading toward you or a matter of navigation.\" One o f the problems he mentioned was the lack of gravity. I had already learned ab out this. O nce away from t he e arth's pull, objects in the space ship would have no weight. The slightest push could send cr ewmen floating aroun d the sealed compartm ent. \"Supp ose you spilled a cup of coffee,\" said the flight surgeon. \"Wh at would happ en?\" I said I hadn't thought it out. \"The Randolph Field lab can tell you,\" he said. \"The coffee would stay right there in the air. So would the cup, if you let go o f it. But there's a more serious angle — your breath.\" \"You'd have artificial air,\" I began. \"Yes, they've already worked that out. But what ab out the breath you exhale? It contains carbon dioxide, and if you let it stay right t here in front of your"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"face you'd be sucking it ba ck into your lun gs. After a while, it would asphyxiate you. So the air has to be kept in motion, and besides that t he ventilating system has to remove the carbon dioxide.\" \"Wh at ab out eating?\" I asked. \"Swallowing is partly g ravity, isn't it?\" He nodd ed. \"Same as drinking, though the throat muscles help force the food down. I don't know the answer to that. In fact, everything ab out t he hu man body presents a problem. Take the blood c irculation. The amoun t of energy required to pump blood through the veins would be almost negligible. Wh at would that do to your heart?\" \"I couldn't even guess,\" I said. \"Well, that's all the Aero-Medical lab can do — guess at it. They've been trying to work out some way of duplicating the e ffect of zero gravity, but there's just no answer. If you could build a machine to neutralize gravity, you could get all the answers, except to the 'dead d istance' question. \"For instance, there's the matter of whether the hu man body would even fun ction without gravity. All down through the stages of evolution, man's organs have been u sed to that downward p ull. Take away g ravity, and your whole body might stop working. So me o f the Aero-Medical men I've talked with don't believe that, but they admit that long trips outside o f gravity might have o dd effects. \"Then there's the question of orientation. Here o n earth, orienting y ourself depends on the feeling you get from t he pull of gravity, plus your vision. just being blindfolded is enough to disorient some people. Taking away the pull of gravity might be a lot worse. And of course o ut in space your only reference points would be distant stars and planets. We've been u sed to locating stars from points on the e arth, w here we know their p osition. But how ab out locating them from out in space, with a ship moving at great speed? Inside the space ship, it would be something like being in a submarine. Probab ly only the pilot compartm ent would have glass ports, and those would be covered except in landing — maybe e ven then. O utside vision might be by television, so you couldn't break a glass port and let out your p ressure. \"But t o go ba ck to the submarine idea. It would be like a sub, w ith this big difference: In the submarine you can generally tell which way is down, except maybe in a crash dive when you may lose your equilibrium for a moment. But in the space ship, you could be standing with your feet on one spot, and another crewman might be — relative to you — standing upside down. You might be floating horizontally, the o ther man vertically. The more you think"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"ab out it, the crazier it gets. But they've got to solve all those problems before we can tackle space.\" To make sure I had the details right, I checked on the Air Force research. I foun d that t he Randolph Field lab oratory is working on all these problems, and many more. Although plans arc not far enough advanced to make it certain, probab ly animals will be sent up in research rockets to determine the e ffect of no gravity before any hu man beings make such flights. The results could be televised ba ck to the e arth. All through my check-up on space e xploration plans, one thing struck me: I met no resistance. There was no o fficial reticence about t he program; on the contrary, nothing ab out it seemed secret. Even though it was peacetime, this was a little curious, because o f the potential war value o f an earth satellite vehicle. Even if the Nazi scheme for destruction proved just a dream, an orbiting space base could be used for other p urposes. In its two-hour swing aroun d the e arth, practically all of the globe could be o bserved-directly, by powerful telescopes, or indirectly, by a combination of radar and television. Long-range missiles could be guided to targets, after being laun ched from some point on the e arth. As the missiles climbed high into the stratosphere, the satellite's radar could p ick them up and keep them on course by remote control. There were o ther p ossibilities for both attack and d efense. O rdinarily, projects with wartime value are kept under wraps, or at least not widely publicized. O f course, the e xplanation might be very simple: The completion of the satellite vehicle was s o remote that there seemed no need for secrecy. But in that case, w hy had the program been announ ced at all? If the purpose had been propaganda, it looked like a weak gesture. The So viets would not be greatly worried by a dream weapon forty or fifty years off. Besides that, the Pentagon, as a rule, doesn't go for such propaganda. There was only one conventional answer that made any sense. If we had heard that t he So viets were ab out to announ ce such a program, as a propaganda trick, it would be smart to beat them to it. But I had no proof of, any such Russian intention. The date o n Se cretary F orrestal's co-ordination ann ouncement was December 30 , 1948 . O ne day later, the o rder cr eating P roject \"Saucer\" had been signed.

By the time he returned, I had written a draft of the Gorman case, with my answer to the ba lloon explanation. When I saw him, the next m orning, I asked him t o look it over. Redell li ghted his pipe and then read the draft, nodding to himself now and then. \"I think that's correct analysis,\" he said when h e finished. \"That was a very curious case. You know, Project 'Saucer' even h ad p sychiatrists out t here. If Gorman h ad been the o nly witness, I think they'd have called it a hallucination. As it was, they took a crack at him and the C.A.A. men in their preliminary report.\" Though I recalled that there had been a comm ent, I didn't remember the wording. Redell l ooked it up and r ead it aloud: \"'From a psychological aspect, the Gorman incident raised the question, \"Is it possible for an object without appr eciable shape o r known aeronautical configuration to app ear to travel at variable speeds and manoeuver intelligently?\"'\" \"Hallucination might soun d like a logical answer,\" I said, \"un til you check all the testimony. But there are just too many witnesses who confirm Gorman's report. Also, he seems like a pretty level-headed c hap.\" Redell filled his pipe again. \"But you still can't quite accept it?\" \"I'm positive they saw the light — but what the devil was it? How could it fly without some kind of airfoil?\" \"Maybe it didn't. You remember Gorman described an odd fuzz iness aroun d the e dge o f the light? It's in this Air Force report. That could have been a reflection from the airfoil.\" \"Yes, but Gorman would have seen any solid — \" I stopp ed, as Redell made a negative gesture. \"It could be solid and still not show up,\" he said."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"\"You mean it was transparent? Sure, that would d o it!\" \"Let's s ay the airfoil was a rotating plastic disk, ab solutely transparent. The blurred, fuzz y look could have been caused by the whirling disk.

He went on carefully, \"In all these saucer c ases, keep this in mind: We may be dealing with some totally un known principle — something completely beyond our comprehension.\" For a moment, I thought he was hunting at some radical discovery by So viet — captured Nazi scientists. Then I realized what he meant. \"You think they're interplanetary,\" I murmured. \"Wh y not?\" Redell l ooked surprised. \"Isn't t hat your idea? I g ot t hat impression.\" \"Yes, but I didn't t hink you believed it. When you said to check on our space plans, I thought you h ad some secret m issile in mind.\" \"No, I had another r eason. I wanted you to see all the problems involved in space travel. If you accept the interplanetary answer, you have to accept this, too — whoever is looking us over has licked all those problems years ago. Techn ically, they'd be hun dreds of years ahead of us — maybe thousands. It has a lot to do with what they'd be up to here.\" Wh en I mentioned the o ld sighting reports, I found that Redell already knew ab out t hem. He was convinced that t he e arth had been un der observation a long time, probab ly even before the first recorded sightings. \"I know some o f those reports aren't authentic,\" he admitted. \"But if you accept even one report of a flying disk or rocket-shaped object before the twentieth century, then you h ave to accept the basic idea. In the last forty years, you might blame the reports on planes and dirigibles. But t here was no propelled aircraft un til 190 3. Either all those e arly sightings were wrong, or some kind of f ast aerial machine has been flying periodically over the earth for at least two centuries."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"I told him I was pretty well convinced, but t hat True faced a problem. There was s ome conflicting evidence, and p art of it seemed linked with guided missiles. I felt sure we could pr ove the space-travel answer, but we had to stay clear of discussing any weapons that were still a secret. \"I can't believe that guided missiles are the answer to the Godman Field saucer and the Chiles-Whitted case, or this business at Fargo. But we're got to be ab solutely sure before we print anything.\" \"Well, let's analyse it,\" said Redell. \"Let's s ee if all the saucers could be explained as s omething launched from t he e arth.\" He reached for a pad and a pencil. \"First, let's take your r otating disk. That would be a lot simpler to build than the stationary disk with variable jet nozzles. With a disk rotated at high speed you get a tremendous lift, w hether it's slotted or c ambered, as long as there's enough air to work on.\" \"The helicopter principle,\" I said. Redell nodd ed. \"The most practical propulsion would be with two o r more jets out on the rim, to spin your rotating section. But t o get up enough speed for the jets to be e fficient, you'd have to whirl the disk mechanically before the take-off. Here's one way. You could have a square hole in the centre; then the disk laun ching device would have a square shaft, rotated by an engine o r a motor. As the speed built up, the cambered disk would r ide up the shaft and free itself, rising v ertically, w ith the jets taking over the job of whirling the cambered section. \"The lift would be terrific, far more than any normal aircr aft. I don't believe any hu man being could take the G's involved in a maximum power climb; they'd have to use remote control. Wh en it got to the desired altitude, your disk could be flown in any direction by tilting it that way. The forward component from that t remendous lift would r esult in a very high speed. The disk could also hover, and d escend vertically.\" \"Wh at ab out m anoeuvering?\" I asked, thinking of Gorman's experience. \"It could turn faster than any pilot could stand,\" said Redell. \"Of course, a pilot's cockpit could be built into a large disk; but there'd have to be some way of holding down the speed, to avoid too many G's in tight m anoeuvers.\""},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"\"Most of the disks don't m ake any noise,\" I said. \"At least, that's the general report. You'd hear ordinary jets for miles.\" \"Right, and here's another angle. Ram jets take a lot of fuel. Even with some highly efficient new jet, I can't see the long ranges reported. So me o f these saucers have been seen all over the world. No matter which hemisphere they were laun ched from, they'd need an eight-thousand-mile range, at least, to explain all of the sightings. The o nly app arent answer would be some new kind of power, probab ly atomic. We certainly didn't have atomic engines for aircr aft in 1947 , w hen the first disks were seen h ere. And we don't have them now, though we're working on it. Even if we had such an engine, it wouldn't be tiny enough to power the small disks .\" \"Anyway,\" I said, \"we'd hardly be flying them all over everywhere. The cost would be e normous, and there'd always be a danger of s omebody g etting the secret if a disk landed.\" \"Plus the risk of injuring people by radiation. just imagine an atomic-powered disk dropping into a city. The whole idea's ridiculous.\" \"That seems to rule o ut t he guided-missile answer,\" I began. But Redell shook his head. \"Disk-s haped missiles are quite feasible. I'm t alking about range, speed, and performance. Imagine for a moment that we have disk- type missiles using the latest jet or r ocket propulsion — either p iloted or remote-controlled. The question is, could such disks f it specific sightings like the o ne at Godman Field and the case at Fargo?\" Redell paused as if some new thought had struck him. \"Wait a minute, here's an even better test. I happ en to know about this case personally. Marvin Miles — he's an aviation writer in Los Angeles — was down at Wh ite S ands Proving Groun d some time ago. He talked with a Navy rocket expert who was in charge o f naval guided-missile projects. This Navy man — he's a commander in the regular service — told M iles they'd seen four saucers down in that area.\" \"You're sure he wasn't kidding Miles?\" I said. Then I remembered Purdy's tip ab out a Wh ite S ands case. \"I told you I checked on this myself,\" Redell said, a little ann oyed. \"After Miles told me ab out it, I asked an engineer who'd been down there if it was true. He gave me the same story, figures and all. The first saucer was tracked"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"by Wh ite S ands observers with a theodolite. Then they worked out its performance with ba llistics formulas.\" Redell l ooked at m e grimly. \"The thing was about fifty miles up. And it was making over fifteen thousand miles an h our!\" One o f the witnesses, said Redell, w as a well-known scientist from t he General Mills aeronautical research lab oratory in Minn eapolis, w hich was working with the Navy. (A few days later, I v erified this f act and the basic details of Redell's accoun t. But it was not until early in Janu ary 1950 that I finally identified the o fficer as Commander Robert B. McLaughlin and got his dramatic story.) \"Here are two more items Miles told me,\" Redell went on. \"This Navy expert said the saucer actually looked elliptical, or egg-shaped. And while it was being tracked it sudd enly made a steep c limb — so steep no hu man being could have lived through it.\" \"One thing is certain,\" I said. \"That fifty-mile altitude knocks out the rotating disk. Up in that thin air it wouldn't have any lift.\" \"Right,\" said Redell. \"And the variab le jet t ype would require an enormous amoun t of fuel. Regardless, those G's mean it couldn't have had any pilot born on this earth.\" According to Marvin Miles, this Wh ite S ands s aucer had been over a hun dred feet long. (Later, Comm ander M cLaughlin stated that it was 105 feet.) If this were an American device, then it meant that we had already licked many of the problems on which the Earth Satellite Vehicle designers were supp osed to be just starting. Their statements, then, w ould have to be false — part of an elab orate cover-up. \"If we had such an advanced design,\" said Redell, \"and I just don't believe it possible — would we gamble o n a remote-control system? No such system is perfect. Supp ose it went wrong. At that speed, over fifteen thousand miles an hour, your pr ecious missile o r strato ship c ould be halfway aroun d the globe in about forty-five minu tes. That is, if the fuel held out. Before you could regain control, you might lose it in the sea. Or it m ight come down behind the Iron Curtain. Even if it were I smashed to bits, it would tip off the So viets. They might claim it was a guided-missile attack. Almost anything could happ en.\""},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"\"It could have a time bomb in it,\" I suggested. \"if it got off course o r out of control, it would blow itself up.\" Redell emphatically shook his head. \"I've heard that idea b efore, but it won't hold up. What if your ship's controls went haywire and the thing blew up over a crowded c ity? Imagine the panic, even if no actual damage was done. No, sir — nobody in his right mind is going to let a hu ge ship like that go barging aroun d unpiloted. It would be criminal negligence. \"If the Wh ite S ands calculations were correct, then this particular saucer was no e arth-made device. Perhaps in coming years, w e could produce such a ship, w ith atomic p ower to drive it. But not now.\" Redell went over several other c ases. \"Take the Godman Field saucer. At one time, it was s een at places one hun dred and seventy-five miles apart, as you know. Even to have been seen at all from both places, it would. have to have been hu ge — much larger than two hu ndred and fifty feet in diameter. The hu man eye wouldn't resolve an object that size, at such a distance and height.\" It was an odd thing; I had, gone o ver the Mantell case a dozen times. I knew the o bject was huge. But I had never tried to figure o ut the o bject's exact size. \"How big do you think it was?\" I asked quickly. This could be the key I had tried to find. \"I haven't worked it out,\" said Redell. \"But I can give you a rough idea. The hu man eye can't resolve any object t hat subtends less than three minu tes of arc. For instance, a plane with a hun dred-foot wing span would only be a speck twenty miles away, if you saw it at all.\" \"But this thing was seen clearly eighty-seven miles away — or even more, if it wasn't m idway between the two cities. Wh y, it would have to be a thousand feet in diameter.\" \"Even larger.\" Redell was silent a moment. \"What was the word M antell used — 'tremendous'?\" I tried to visualize the thing, but m y mind ba lked. One thing was certain n ow. It was utterly impossible that any nation on earth could have built such an enormous airborne machine. just t o think of the force required to hold it in the sky was enough to stagger any engineer. We were years away — perhaps centuries — from any such possibility. As if he had r ead my thoughts, Redell said soberly, \"There's no o ther p ossible"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"answer. It was a huge space ship — perhaps the largest ever to come into o ur atm osphere.\" It was clear now w hy such desperate e fforts had been made to e xplain away the o bject Mantell had c hased. \"Wh at ab out that Eastern Airlines sighting?\" I asked. \"Well, first,\" said Redell, \"it wasn't any remote-control guided missile. I'll say it again; it would be sheer insanity. Supp ose that t hing had cr ashed in Macon. At t hat speed it could have plowed its way for blocks, right t hrough the buildings. It could have killed hundreds of people, burned the heart out of the city. \"If it was a missile, or some hu sh-hush experimental job, then it was piloted. But they don't test a j ob like that on any comm ercial airways. And they don't fool aroun d at five thousand feet where people will see the thing streaking by and c all the newspapers. \"To power a hun dred-foot wingless s hip, especially at t hose speeds, w ould take e normous f orce. Not as much as a V-two rocket, but t remendous power. The fuel load would be terrific. Certainly, the pilot wouldn't be circling aroun d Georgia a nd Alab ama for an hour, buzz ing airliners. I'll stake everything that we couldn't duplicate that space ship's performance for less than fifty milli on dollars. It would take something brand-new in jets.\" Redell paused. He looked at me grimly. \"And the way I'd have to soup it up, it would be a damned d angerous s hip to fly. No pilot would d eliberately fly it that low. He'd stay up where he'd have a chance to ba il out.\" I told him what I had heard ab out the blueprints the Air Force was s aid to have rushed. \"Of course they were worried,\" said Redell. \"And p robab ly they still are. But I don't t hink they need be; so far, there's been nothing menacing about t hese space ships.\" Wh en I g ot him ba ck to the Gorman case, Redell drew a sketch on his pad, showing me his idea of the disk light. He e stimated the transparent rim as not m ore than five feet in diameter. \"Possibly smaller,\" he said. \"You recall that Gorman said the light was between six and eight inches in diameter. He also said it seemed to have depth — that was in the Air Force report.\""},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"\"You think all the mechanism was hidd en by the light?\" \"Only possible answer,\" said Redell. \"But just t ry to imagine crowding a motor, or jet controls for rim jets, along with remote controls and a television device, in that small space. Plus your fuel supp ly. I don't know any engineer who would even attempt it. To carry that m uch gear, it would take a fair-sized p lane. You could make a disk large e nough, but the mechanism and fuel section would be two o r three feet across, at least. So Gorman's light must have been powered and controlled by some unique means. The same principle app lies to all the o ther light reports I've heard. No shape behind them, high speed, and intelligent m manoeuvers That t hing was guided from some interplanetary ship, hovering at a high altitude,\" Redell declared. \"But I haven't any idea what source o f power it used.\" Until then, I had forgotten ab out Art Green's letter. I told Redell what Art had said ab out the Geiger c oun ter. \"I knew they went over Gorman's f ighter with a Geiger counter,\" Redell commented. \"But t hey said the reaction was negative. If Green is right, it's interesting. It would mean they have built incredibly small atomic engines. But with a race so many y ears ahead of us, it shouldn't be surprising. O f course, they may also be using some o ther kind of power our scientists s ay is impossible.\" I was ab out to ask him what he meant when his s ecretary came in. \"Mr. Carson is waiting,\" she told Redell. \"He had a four-o'clock app ointm ent.\" As I started to leave, Redell l ooked at his calendar. \"I hate to break this up; it's a fascinating business What ab out coming in Friday? I'd like to see the rest of those case reports.\" \"Fine,\" I said. \"I've got a few more questions, too.\" Going out, I made a mental note o f the Friday date. Then the figure clicked; it was just three months since I'd started on this assignment. Three months ago. At that time I'd only been h alf sure that the saucers were real. If anyone had said I'd soon believe they were space ships, I'd have told him he was crazy. ~"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"CHAPTER XIII BE FORE my date with Redell, I went over all the material I had, hoping to find some clue to the space visitors' p lanet. It was possible, of course, that there was more than one planet involved. Project \"Saucer\" had d iscussed the possibilities in it! report of April 27 , 194 9. I read over this s ection again: Since flying saucers f irst hit t he headlines almost t wo years ago, there has been wide speculation that t he aerial phenomena might actually be some form of penetration from another p lanet. Actually, astronomers are largely in agreement t hat only one member of the solar system beside Earth is capab le o f supp orting life. That is Mars. Even Mars, however, app ears to be relatively desolate and inh ospitab le, so that a Martian race would be more o ccupied with survival than we are o n Earth. On Mars, there e xists an excessively slow loss of atmosphere, oxygen and water, against which intelligent beings, if they do e xist there, may have protected themselves by scientific control of physical conditions. This might have been done, scientists s peculate, by the construction of homes and c ities un dergroun d where the atm ospheric pressure would be greater and thu s temperature e xtremes reduced. The o ther p ossibilities exist, of course, that evolution may have developed a b eing who can withstand the rigours of the Martian climate, or that the race — if it ever d id exist — has perished. In other words, the e xistence o f intelligent life o n Mars, w here the rare atm osphere is nearly devoid of oxyg en and water and where the nights are much colder than our Arctic winters, is not impossible but is completely un proven. The possibility of intelligent life also e xisting on the planet Venu s is not considered c ompletely un reasonable by astronomers. The atm osphere o f Venu s app arently consists mostly of carbon dioxide with deep c louds of formaldehyde droplets, and there seems to be little o r no water. Yet, scientists concede that living organisms might develop in chemical environments which are strange to us. Venus, however, has two handicaps. Her mass and gravity are nearly as large as the Earth (Mars is s maller) and her c loudy atm osphere would d iscourage astronomy, hence space travel. The last argument, I thought, did not have too much weight. We were"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"plann ing to e scape the e arth's gravity; Martians could d o the same, with their p lanet. As f or the cloudy atm osphere, they could have developed some system of radio o r r adar investigation of the un iverse. The Navy research un its, I knew, w ere probing the far-off Crab nebula in the Milky Way with special radio devices. This s ame method, or something far superior, could have been developed on Venu s, or other p lanets surroun ded by constant clouds. After the discussion of solar-system planets, the Project \"Saucer\" report went on to o ther star systems: Outside the solar system other stars — 22 in nu mber — have satellite planets. Our sun h as nine. O ne o f these, the Earth, is ideal for existence o f intelligent life. O n two o thers there is a possibility of life. Therefore, astronomers believe reasonable the thesis that t here could be at least one ideally habitable planet for each of the 22 other eligible stars. (After p ublication of our findings in True, several astronomers said that many planets may be inhab ited. O ne o f these was Dr. Carl F. von W eizacker, noted University of Chicago physicist. O n Ja nu ary 10, 1950 , D r. von Weizacker stated: \"Billi ons upon billi ons of s tars f ound in the heavens may each h ave their own planets revolving ab out t hem. It is possible that these planets would have plant and animal li fe o n them similar to the e arth's.\") After narrowing the e ligible stars down to twenty-two the Project \" Saucer\" report goes on: The theory is also e mployed that m an represents the average in advancement and d evelopment. Therefore, one-half the o ther habitable planets would be behind man in development, and the o ther half ahead. It is also assumed that any v isiting race could be e xpected to be far in advance o f man. Thus, the chance o f space travelers existing at planets attached to neighbouring stars is very much greater than the chance o f s pace-traveling Martians. The o ne can be viewed as almost a certainty (if you accept t he thesis that the nu mber of inh abited p lanets is equal to those that are suitab le for life and that intelligent life is not peculiar to the Earth) .\" The most likely star was Wolf 359 — eight light-years away. I thought for a minu te about t raveling that vast distance. It was almost app alling, considered in terms of man's life span. O f course, dwellers on other p lanets might live much longer. If the speed of light was not an absolute limit, almost any space journey"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"would then be possible. Since there would be no resistance in outer space, it would be simply a matter of using rocket power in the first stages to accelerate to the maximum speed d esired. In the latter phase, the rocket's drive would have to be reversed, to decelerate for the landing. The night before my appointm ent with Redell, I was checking a case report when the phone rang. It was John Steele. \"Are you still working on the saucers?\" he asked. \"If you are, I have a suggestion — something that m ight be a real lead.\" \"I could use a lead r ight now,\" I told him. \"I can't give you the source, but it's one I consider r eliab le,\" said Steele. \"This man says the disks are British developments.\" This was a new one. I hadn't considered the British. Steele talked for over half an h our, expanding the idea. The saucers, his informant said, w ere rotating disks with cambered surfaces — originally a Nazi device. Near the e nd of the war, the British h ad seized all the models, along with the German technicians and scientists who had worked on the project. The first British types had been developed secretly in England, according to this account. But the first tests showed a dangerous lack of control; the disks streaked up to high altitudes, hu rtling without direction. So me had been seen over the Atlantic, some in Turkey, Spain, and other p arts of Europe. The British then h ad shifted operations to Australia, w here a guided-missile test range had been set up. (This part, I knew, could be true; there was such a range.) After improving their remote-control system, w hich used both radio and r adar, they had built disks up to a hu ndred feet in diameter. These were laun ched out over the Pacific, the first ones s traight eastward over open sea. British destroyers were stationed at 10 0-mile and later 500 -mile intervals, to track the missiles by radar and c orrect their c ourses. At a set t ime, w hen their fuel was almost exhausted, the disks came down vertically and landed in the o cean. Since part of the device was s ealed, the disks would float; then a special l aun ching ship would hoist t hem ab road, refuel them, and laun ch them ba ck toward a remote base in Australia, w here they were landed by remote control. Since then, Steele said, the disks ' r ange and speed had been greatly increased. The first tests of the new disks was in the spring of 194 7, his"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"informant had told him. The British h ad rushed the project, because o f So viet Russia's menacing attitude. Their only defence in England, the British knew, would be some powerful guided missile that could d estroy So viet ba ses after the first attack. In order to check the range and speeds accurately, it was necessary to have observers in the Western Hemisphere — the disks were now traversing the Pacific. The ideal test range, the British decided, w as one e xtending over Canada, where the disks could be tracked and even landed. If the accoun t was right, said Steele, a ba se had been set up in the desolate Hudson Bay country. Special radar-tracking stations had also been estab lished, to guide the missiles toward Australia and vessels at sea. These stations also helped to bring in missiles from Australia. So me o f the disk missiles were supposed to have been laun ched from a British island in the So uth Pacific; others came all the way from Australia. Still others were believed to have been laun ched by a mother ship stationed between the Galapagos Islands and Pitcairn. It was these new disks that had been seen in the United States, Alaska, Canada, and Latin America, Steele's informant had told him. At first, the sightings were due to imperfect controls; the disks s ometimes f ailed to keep their altitude, partly because o f conflicting radio and radar beams f rom the coun tries below. Responding to some o f these mixed signals, Steele said, the disks had been known to reverse course, hover or d escend over r adar and radio stations, or c ircle aroun d at high speeds un til their own control system picked them up again. For this reason, the British h ad arranged a simple detonator system, operated either by remote control or automatically under certain conditions. In this way, no disk would cr ash over land, with the danger of hitting a populated area. If it descended below a certain altitude, the disk would automatically speed up its rotation, then explode at a high altitude. Wh en radar trackers saw that a disk was off course and could not be realigned, the nearest station then sent a special signal to activate the detonator system. This was always done, Steele had been told, w hen a disk headed toward Siberia; there had p reviously been a few cases when Australian-laun ched disks had got away from controllers and app eared over Europe. I listened to S teele's accoun t with mixed astonishment and suspicion. It soun ded like a pipe dream; but if it was, it had been carefully thought out, especially the details that followed."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"At first, Steele said, American defence o fficials had been completely ba ffled by the disk reports. Then the British, learning ab out t he sightings, had hastily explained to top-level American officials. An agreement had been worked out. We were to have the benefit of their r esearch and testing and working models, in return for helping to conceal the secret. We were also to aid in tracking and c ontrolling the missiles when they passed over this coun try. \"And I g ather we paid in other ways,\" Steele said. \"My source says this played a b ig part in increasing our aid to Britain, including certain atomic secrets.\" That could make sense. Sharing such a secret would be worth all the money and supp lies we had p oured into England. If America a nd Great Britain both had a superior long-range missile, it would be the biggest factor I knew for holding off war. But t he long ranges involved in Steele's explanation made the thing incredible. \"How are they powered? Wh at fuel do they use?\" I asked him. \"That's the o ne thing I couldn't get,\" said Steele. \"This man told me it was the most carefully g uarded secret of all. They've tapped a new source o f power.\" \"If he means atomic engines,\" I said, \"I don't believe it. I don't think anyone is that far along.\" \"No, no,\" Steele said earnestly, \"he said it wasn't t hat. And the rest of the story hangs together.\" Privately, I thought of two o r three holes, but I let that go. \"If it's British,\" I said, \"do you think we should even h int at it?\" \"I don't see any harm,\" Steele answered. \"The Russians undoubtedly know the truth. They have agents everywhere. It m ight do a lot of good for American-British relations. Anyway, it would offset any fear that the saucers are So viet weapons.\" \"Then you're not worried ab out that angle any more?\" Steele laughed. \"No, but it had me going for a while. It was a b ig relief to find out the disks are British.\" \"Wh at's the disks ' ceiling?\" I asked, abruptly."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"\"Oh — sixty thousand feet, at least,\" said Steele. After a moment he add ed quickly, \"That's just a guess — they probab ly operate much higher. I didn't think to ask.\" Before I hu ng up, he asked me what I thought, of the British explanation. \"It's certainly more plausible than the So viet idea,\" I said. I thanked him for calling me, and p ut down the phone. I was tempted to point out t he flaws in his s tory. But I didn't. If he was s incere, it would be poor thanks for what he had told me. If he was trying to plant a fake e xplanation, it wouldn't hu rt t o let him t hink I'd swallowed it. Wh en I saw Redell, I told him about Steele. \"It does look like an attempt to steer you away from t he interplanetary answer,\" Redell agreed, \"though h e may be passing on a tip he believes.\" \"You think there could be any truth in the British story?\" \"Would the British risk a hun dred-foot disk crashing in some American city?\" said Redell. \"No remote control is perfect, and neither is a detonator system. By some freak accident, a disk might come down in a place like Chicago, and then blow up. I just can't see the British — any more than ourselves — letting hu ge un piloted missiles go ba rging aroun d the world, flying along airways and over c ities. Certainly, they could have automatic d evices to make them veer away from airliners — but what if a circuit failed?\" \"I g o along with that,\" I said. \"I don't say the British don't have some long-range missiles,\" Redell broke in. \"Every big nation h as a guided-missile project. But no guided missile o n earth can explain the Mantell case and the o thers we've discussed.\" I showed him t he material I had on the Nazi disk experiments. Redell skimm ed through it and nodd ed. \"I can tell you a little more,\" he said. \"So me top Nazi scientists were convinced we were being observed by space visitors. They'd searched all the old r eports. So me sighting over Germany set t hem off ab out 1940 . That's what I was told. I think that's where they first got the idea of trying out oval and c ircular airfoils. \"Up to then, nobody was interested. The rotation idea uses the same principle"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"as the helicopter, but nobody had even followed that through. The Nazis went to work on the disks . They also began to rush space-exploration plans — the orbiting satellite idea. I think they realized these space ships were using some great source o f power we hadn't discovered on earth. I believe that's what they were after — that power secret. If they'd succeeded, they'd have owned the world. As it was, that space project caused them t o leap ahead of everybody with rockets.\" Wh en I asked Redell how he thought t he space ships were powered, he shrugged. \"Probab ly cosmic r ays hold the answer. Their p ower would be e ven greater than atomic p ower. There's another source I've heard mentioned, but most people scoff at it. That's the use o f electromagnetic fields in space. The e arth has its magnetic field, of course, and so does the sun . Probab ly all planets do. \"There's a man n amed Fernand Roussel who wrote a book called The Unifying P rinciple o f Physical Phenomena, ab out 19 43. He goes into the electromagnetic-field theory. If he's right, then there must be some way to tap this force and go from one planet to another without using any fuel. You'd use your first planet's magnetic field to start you off and then coast t hrough space un til you got into the field of the next planet. At least, that's how I un derstand it. But you'd be safer sticking to atomic p ower. That's been proved.\" Most of our c onversations had been keyed to the techn ical side o f the flying-saucer pr oblem. But before I left t his time, I asked Redell how the thought of space visitors affected him. \"Oh, at first I had a queer feeling ab out it,\" he answered. \"But once you accept it, it's like anything else. You get used to the idea.\" \"One thing bothers me,\" I said. \"Wh en I try to picture them, I keep remembering the crazy-looking things in some o f the comics. Wh at do you supp ose they're really like?\" \"I've thought ab out it for months.\" Redell slowly shook his head. \"I haven't the slightest idea.\" ~"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"CHAPTER XIV THAT EVE NING, after my talk with Redell, the question kept coming ba ck in my mind. Wh at were they like? And what were they doing here? From the long record of s ightings, it was possible to get an answer to the second question. O bservation of the e arth followed a general pattern. According to the reports, Europe, the most populated area, had been more closely observed than the rest of the globe un til about 1870 . By this time, the United States, beginn ing to rival Europe in industrial progress, had evidently become o f interest to the space-ship cr ews. From t hen on, Europe and the Western Hemisphere, chiefly North America, shared the o bservers' attention. The few sightings reported at other p oints aroun d the world indicate an occasional check-up on the e arth in general. App arently World War I had not greatly concerned the space o bservers. O ne reason might be that our aerial operations were still at a relatively low altitude. But World War II had d rawn more attention, and this had obviously increased from 1947 up to the present time. O ur atomic-bomb explosions and the V-2 high-altitude e xperiments might be o nly coincidence, but I could think of no o ther d evelopment that m ight seriously concern dwellers on other planets. It was a strange thing to think of s ome far-off race keeping track of the earth's progress. If Redell was right, it might even h ave started in prehistoric time; a b rief s urvey, perhaps once a century or even further spaced, then gradually more frequent observation as cities app eared on the e arth. So mewhere o n a distant planet t here would be records of that long survey. I wondered how our d evelopment would app ear to that far-advanced r ace. They would have seen the slow sailing ships, the first steamships, the lines of steel tracks that carried our first trains. Watching for our first aircraft, they would see the drifting ba lloons that seemed an aerial miracle when the Montgolfiers first succeeded. More than a century later, they would have noted the slow, clumsy airplanes of the e arly 190 0's. From our gradual progress to the big planes and bombers of today, they could pr obably chart our next steps toward the stratosphere--and then"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"space. During the last two centuries, they would have watched a dozen wars, each one fiercer than the last, spreading over the globe. Add ing up all the things they had seen, they could d raw an accurate picture o f man, the e arth creature, and the increasingly fierce struggle between the e arth races. The long survey held no sign of menace. If there had been a guiding purpose of attack and destruction, it could have been carried out years ago. It was almost certain that any planet race ab le to traverse space would have the means for attack. More than once, during this investigation, I had been asked: \"If the saucers are interplanetary, w hy haven't t hey landed here? Wh y haven't t heir cr ews tried to make contact with u s?\" There was always the possibility that t he planet race o r r aces could not survive o n earth, or that their comm un ications did not include the methods that we used. But I foun d that hard to believe. Such a superior r ace would certainly be able to master our radio o perations, or anything else that we had developed, in a fairly short t ime. And it should be e qually simple to devise some means of survival on earth, just as we were already planning special suits and helmets for existence o n the moon. D uring a talk with a former Intelligence o fficer, I g ot a key to the probab le e xplanation. \"Wh y don't you just reverse it--list what we intend to do when we start exploring space? That'll give you the appr oximate picture o f what visitors to the e arth would be doing.\" Naturally, all the details of s pace plans have not been worked out, but t he general plan is clear. After the first successf ul earth satellites, w e will either attempt a space ba se farther out or else launch a moon rocket. Probab ly many roun d trips to the moon will be made before going farther in space. Wh ich planet will be e xplored first, after the moon? According to Air Force reports, it is almost a certainty that planets outside the solar system are inhab ited. But because o f the vast distances involved, expeditions to o ur neighboring planets may be tried before the more formidab le journeys. More than one prominent astronomer believes that life, entirely different from our own, may exist on some solar p lanets. Besides Mars, Jupiter, and Venus, there are five more that, like the e arth, revolve aroun d the sun ."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"One o f the prominent authorities is Dr. H. Spencer Jones, Astronomer Royal. In h is book Life o n Other Worlds, D r. Jones points out that everything about us is the result of changing processes, begun millenn iums ago and still going on. We cannot define life solely in our own terms; it can exist in u nfamiliar forms. \"It is conceivable,\" Dr. Jones s tates in h is book, \"that we could have beings, the cells of whose bodies contained silicon instead of the carbon which is an essential constituent of our c ells and of all other living cells on the e arth. And that because o f this essential difference between the constitution of those cells and the cells of which animal and p lant life o n the e arth are built up, they might be ab le to e xist at temperatures s o high that no terrestrial types of life could survive.\" According to Dr. Jones, then, life could be possible o n worlds hotter and dr ier than ours; it could also e xist on a very much colder one, such as Mars. Even if a survey of the sun 's planets proved fruitless, it would d ecide the question of their being populated. Also, it would pr ovide valuab le e xperience for the much longer journeys into space. No o ne e xpects s uch a survey until we have a space vehicle ab le to make the roun d trip. O ne-way trips would tell us nothing, even if volunteers offered to make such suicidal journeys. The most probab le step will be to laun ch a space vehicle e quipp ed with supp lies for a long time, perhaps a year or two, within the solar system. Since Mars has been frequently mentioned as a source o f the flying saucers, let's assume it would be the first solar-system planet t o be e xplored from t he earth. As the space ship neared M ars, it could be turned to circle the planet in an orbit, just like o ur p lann ed earth satellite vehicle. O nce in this orbit, it could circle indefinitely without using fuel except to correct its course. From t his s pace base, unmann ed r emote-control \"observer\" units with television \"eyes\" or other transmitters would be sent down to survey the planet at close range. If it t hen seemed fairly safe, a mann ed un it could be released to make a more thorough check-up. Such preliminary caution would be imperative. O ur explorers would have no idea of what awaited them. The planet might be un inhab ited. It m ight be peopled by a fiercely barbarous race unaware o f civilization as we know it. Or it m ight have a civilization far in advance o f ours."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"The e xplorers would first t ry to get a general idea of the whole planet. Then they would attempt t o e xamine the most densely populated areas, types of armature, any aircraft likely to attack them. Combing the radio spectrum, they would p ick up and r ecord soun ds and signals in order to decipher the language. As on earth, they might hear a hodgepodge o f tongues. The next step would be to select the most t echn ically advanced nation, listen in, and try to learn its language, or r ecord it for d eciphering afterward on earth. Our astronomers already have analyzed M ars's atmosphere, but the explorers would have to confirm their reports, to find out whether the atm osphere at the surface would supp ort t heir lungs if they landed. The easiest way would be to send d own mann ed or un manned units with special app aratus to scoop in atm osphere samples. Later analysis would tell whether earthlings would need oxygen-helmet suits such as we plan to use o n the moon. But before risking flight at such low altitudes, the e xplorers would first learn everything possible ab out t he planet's aircraft, if any. They would try to determine their top ceiling, maximum speed, maneuverab ility, and if possible their weapons. Mitch of this could be done by sending down remote-control \"observer\" disks , or whatever type we decide to use. A manned un it m ight make a survey at night, or in daytime with clouds nearby to shield it. By hovering over the planet's aircr aft ba ses, the e xplorers could get m ost of the picture, and also decide whether the bases were suitab le for their own u se later. It m ight even be necessary to lure some Martian aircr aft into pursuit of our un its, to find out their p erformance.

Another interplanetary craft from t he e arth might t ake its place later to resume periodic surveys. In this way, a vast amoun t of information could be collected without once making contact with the strange race.

Analysis of their atm osphere might show a great hazard to earthlings, one making it impossible to land or r equiring y ears of research to overcome. There might be o ther obstacles beyond our pr esent un derstanding. This s ame procedure would app ly to the rest of the solar-system planets and to more distant systems. Since Wolf 359 is the nearest star outside o ur system t hat is likely to have inhab ited p lanets, one o f these planets would probab ly be listed as the first to e xplore in far-distant space. It would be a tremendous undertaking, un less the speed of light can be e xceeded in space. Since Wolf 359 is eight light-years f rom the e arth, even if a space ship traveled at the theoretical maximum--just under 186 ,00 miles a second--it would take o ver sixteen years for the round trip. D etailed observation of the planet would add to this period. If we assume half that speed--which would still be an incredible attainment with our present knowledge--our space e xplorers would have to dedicate at least thirty-two years to the hazardous, lonely round trip. However, there has never been a lack of volunteers for grand un dertakings in the history of man. It is quite possible that in our survey of the solar-system planets we would find some inhab ited, but not advanced enough to be o f interest t o us. Periodically, w e might m ake return visits to note their p rogress. Meantime, our astronomers would watch these planets, probably developing new, higher powered telescopes f or the purpose, to detect any signs of unu sual activity. Any tremendous explosion on a planet would immediately concern u s. Such an explosion, on Mars, w as reported by astronomers on Ja nuary 16, 195 0. The cause and general effects are still being deba ted. Sadao Saeki, the Ja panese astronomer who first reported it at Osaka, believes it was of volcanic nature. The e xplosion created a cloud over an area ab out seven h undred miles in diameter and forty miles high. It was dull gray with a yellowish tinge and a different color from t he atm ospheric phenomena customarily seen near M ars.

Supp ose for a moment that it happ ened many y ears f rom now, w hen we will have succeeded in space explorations. At this time, let us assume o ur explorers have found that Mars is experimenting with h igh-altitude rockets; some o f them have been seen, rising at tremendous s peed, in the upper atm osphere o f Mars. Then comes this violent explosion. A scientific analysis of the cloud by astrophysicists here o n earth proves it was of atomic origin. The first reaction would un doubtedly be an immediate resurvey of Mars. As quickly as possible, w e would estab lish an orbiting space base--out of range o f Martian rockets-- and try to find how far they had advanced with atomic bombs. Samples of the Martian atm osphere would be collected and analyzed for telltale radiation. O bserver units would be flown over the planet, w ith instruments to locate atom-bomb plants and p ossibly uranium deposits. The rocket-launching bases would also come un der c lose o bservation. We would try to learn how close the scientists were to e scaping the pull of gravity. Since Mars's gravity is much less than the e arth's, the Martians would not have so far to progress before succeeding in space travel. The detailed survey by our space-base o bservers would pr oba bly show that there was no immediate danger to the e arth.

Any warlike ideas they had in mind could be quickly ended by a show of our superior space craft and our own atomic weapons-- probab ly far superior to any on Mars.

As the scare increased, the daytime sightings decreased for a while, and mystery lights began to be seen more o ften. This app arent desire to avoid un favorable attention could have been caused by our p ilots' r epeated attempts to chase the strange flying objects. Authentic r eports have described sightings; over the following Air Force ba ses: Chanute, Newark, Andrews, Hickam, Robbins, G odman, Clark, Fairfield Suisan, D avis-Monthan, Harmon, Wright-Patterson, Holloman, Clinton Coun ty Air Force Base, and air bases in Alaska, G ermany, and the Azores. Saucers have also been sighted over naval air stations at Dallas, Alameda, and Key West, and from t he station at Se attle. They have been reported maneuvering over the Wh ite S ands Proving Groun d, over areas containing atomic developments, ab ove the Muroc Air Base testing area, and over the super-secret research ba se near Albuquerque. Se veral times s aucers have paced both military and c ivil aircr aft; their actions s trongly indicate deliberate e ncounters to learn our p lanes' speed and performance. It seems obvious that both the planes and the bases were being observed, and in some cases photographed by remote-control un its or mann ed space ships. Although I thought it improbab le that t he location of our uranium deposits would be o f interest t o space men, a Washington official told me it would be relatively simple to detect the o re areas with airborne instruments. \"The Geological Survey has already developed special Geiger c oun ters for planes,\" he told me. \"They had a little trouble from cosmic-ray noise. They finally had to cover the Geigers with lead shields. Wh enever an important amoun t of radiation is present in the groun d, the plane crew gets a signal, and they spot the place o n their map. It's a q uick way of locating v aluable deposits.\" Wh en I told him what I had in mind, he suggested an angle I had not considered. \"Mind you,\" he said, \"I'm not completely sold on the interplanetary answer. But assuming it's correct that we're being observed, I can think of a stronger reason than fear of s ome distant attack. So me atomic scientists s ay that a super-atomic bomb, or several set off at once, could knock the e arth out of its orbit. It soun ds fantastic, but so is the A-bomb. It's just possible that some solar-planet race discovered the dangers long ago. They would have good reason to worry if they foun d we were o n that same track. There may be some"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"other atomic weapon we don't suspect, even worse than the A-bomb, one that could d estroy the e arth and seriously affect other p lanets.\" At t he time, I thought this was just idle speculation. But since then, several atomic scientists have confirmed this official's suggestion. O ne o f these was Dr. Paul Elliott, a nuclear physicist who worked on the A-bomb during the war. According to Dr. Elliott, if s everal hydrogen bombs were e xploded simultaneously at a high altitude, it could speed up the e arth's rotation or change its orbit. He based his statement on the rate o f energy the e arth receives from t he sun , a rate e qual to some four p oun ds of hydrogen exploded every second. Still other atomic scientists have said that H- bomb explosions might even knock a large chun k out of the e arth, w ith unpredictab le results. A dramatic p icture o f what m ight happ en if the e arth were forced far out of its orbit is indicated in the much-discussed book Worlds in Collision, by Dr. Imm anu el Velikovsky, recently published by Macmillan. After many y ears of research, D r. Velikovsky presents strong evidence that the planet Venu s, when still a comet resulting from eruption from a larger p lanet, moved erratically about the sky and violently disturbed both the e arth and M ars. Wh en the comet app roached the e arth, our planet was f orced out of its orbit, according to Worlds in Collision. For a time, the world was on the brink of destruction. Q uoting many authentic ancient records, including the Quiché manu script of the Mayas, the Ipuwer p apyrus of the Egyptians, and the Visidd hi-Magga of the Budd hists, D r. Velikovsky describes the cataclysm that t ook place. \"The face o f the e arth changed,\" he writes in h is book. The details, reinforced by the Zend-Avesta of the Persians, tell of tremendous hu rricanes, of a major upheaval in the e arth's s urface, of oceans rushing over many parts of the land, w hile rivers were driven from t heir beds. So me o f the events in this period are mentioned in the Bible. Professor Horace M. K allen, former d ean of the New School of So cial Research, strongly endorses Dr. Velikovsky's s tatements: \"It is my belief that Velikovsky has s upp orted his theses with substantial evidence and made an effective and p ersuasive argument.\" Many other authorities endorse this work, w hich is documented with impressive references. But even if this particular accoun t is not accepted, all astronomers agree that the e ffect of a comet passing near the e arth would be app alling. Worlds in Collision states that Mars, like the e arth, w as pulled out of its orbit by the comet's erratic p assage.

I spent the next t wo days runn ing down a sighting report from a town in Penn sylvania. Like three o r four other tips that had seemed important at first, it turned out to be a dud. Wh en I got back home, I foun d Ken Purdy had been trying to reach me. I phoned him at True, and he asked me to fly up to New York the next day. \"I've just heard there's another magazine working on the saucer story,\" he told me. \"Wh o is it?\" I said. \"I don't know yet. It may be just a rumor, but we can't t ake a chance. We've got to get this in the Ja nu ary book.\" That night I gathered up all the material. It looked hopeless to condense it into o ne article, and I knew that Purdy had even more investigators' reports waiting for me in New York. Flying up the next m orning, I sudd enly thought of a talk I'd had with an air transport official. It was in W ashington; I had just told him ab out the investigation. \"If they are spacemen,\" he said, \"they'd pr obab ly have a hard time figuring out this country by listening to o ur broadcasts.

But now, thinking seriously ab out it, I realized he had an important point. It was possible that m en from another p lanet might have to reorient even their way of thinking to un derstand the e arth's ways. It would not be automatic, despite their superior techn ical progress. Evolution might have produced ba sic differences in their un derstanding of life.

I couldn't begin to visualize beings with totally different cells, perhaps able to take terrific heat or bitter c old as merely normal weather. There were all kinds of possibilities.

They might be easily subject t o o ur d iseases, especially if they had d estroyed d isease germs on their p lanet--a natural step for an advanced r ace. It was possible, I knew, that the spacemen might look grotesque to us. But I clun g to a Stubborn feeling that t hey would r esemble man. That came, of course, from an inborn feeling of man's s uperiority over all li ving things.

I g ave up trying to imagine how the spacemen might look. There was s imply nothing to go o n. But t here were strong indications of how they thought and reacted. Certain qualities were plainly evident. Intelligence. No o ne could d ispute that. It took a high order of mentality to construct and operate a space ship. Courage. It would take brave men to face the hazards of space. Curiosity. Without t his quality, they would never have thought t o e xplore far-distant planets. There were o ther qualities that seemed almost equally certain. These spacemen app arently lacked belligerence; there had been no sign of hostility through all the years. They were seemingly painstaking and extremely methodical. It was s till not much of a picture. But somehow, it was encouraging. Glancing down from the plane's window, I thought: How does this look to them? Our farms, our c ities, the railroads there below; the highways, w ith the speeding cars and trucks; the winding river, and far off to the right, the broad stretch of the Atlantic.

Using the e vidence o f the Mantell case, the Chiles-Whitted r eport, Gorman's mystery-light encounter, and other authentic c ases, along with the records of early sightings, w e would state o ur main conclusion: that the flying saucers were interplanetary. In going over the mass of reports, Purdy and I both realized that a few sightings did not fit the space-observer pattern. Most of these reports came from t he southwest states, w here guided-missile e xperiments were going on. Purdy agreed with Paul Redell that any long-range tests would be made o ver the sea or unpopulated areas, w ith every attempt at secrecy. \"They might m ake short-range tests down there in New Mexico and Arizona-maybe o ver Texas,\" he said. \"But t hey'd never r isk killi ng people by shooting the things all over the coun try.\" \"They've already set up a three-thousand-mile range for the longer r uns,\" I add ed. \"It runs f rom Florida into the So uth Atlantic. And the Navy missiles at Point Mugu are laun ched out over the Pacific. Any g uided missiles coming down over settled areas would c ertainly be an accident.

O f course, the imm ediate e ffect was more important. Personally, I thought t hat m ost Americans could take e ven an official announ cement without t oo much trouble. But I could be wrong. \"The o nly y ardstick — and that's not much good — is that 'little men' story,\" said Purdy. \"A lot of people have got excited ab out it, but t hey seem m ore interested than scared.\" The story of the \"little men from Venu s\" had been circulating for some time. In the usual version, two flying saucers had c ome down n ear our southwest border. In the space craft were several oddly dressed men, three feet high. All of them were dead; the cause was usually given as inab ility to stand our atm osphere. The Air Force was s aid to have hu shed up the story, so that the public c ould be e ducated gradually to the truth. Though it had all the earmarks of a well-thought-out hoax, many newspapers had r epeated the story. It had even been broadcast as f act on several radio newscasts. But there had been no signs of public alarm. \"It looks as if people have come a long way since that Orson W elles scare,\" I said to Purdy. \"But t here isn't any menace in this s tory,\" he o bjected. \"The crews were reported d ead, so e verybody g ot t he idea that spacemen couldn't live if they landed. Wh at if a space ship should sudd enly come down over a b ig city — say New York — low enough for milli ons of people to see it?\" \"it might cause a stampede,\" I said, Purdy snorted. \"it would be a miracle if it didn't, un less people had been fully prepared. if we do a straight fact piece, just giving the e vidence, it will start the ba ll rolling. People at least will be thinking about it.\" Before I left for Washington, I told Purdy of my last visit t o the Pentagon. I had informed Air Force press relations officials of True's intention to publish the space-travel answer. There had been no attempt to dissuade me. And I had been told once again that t here was no security involved; that Project \"Saucer\" had found nothing threatening the safety of America. At this time I had also asked if Project \"Saucer\" files were now availab le. The Wright Field un it, I was told, still was a classified p roject, both its f iles and its photographs s ecret. This had been the first week in October. Wh en I asked if there was any other information on published c ases, the"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"answer again was negative.

It explains why F orrestal ann ounced our Earth Satellite Vehicle program, years before we could even start to build it. It also would explain those Project 'Saucer' hints in the April report.\" \"I think we're being used as a trial ba lloon,\" Purdy said thoughtfully. \"We've let t hem know w hat we're doing. If they'd wanted to stop us, the Air Force could easily have done it. All they'd have to do would be call us in, give us the dope o ff the record, and tell us it was a patriotic d uty to keep still. Just t he way they did ab out uranium and atomic experiments during the war.\" He still did not have the name o f the o ther magazine supposed to be working on the saucers. But it seemed a reliab le tip (it later pr oved to be true), and from t hen on we worked under high pressure. In writing the article, I used only the most authentic r ecent sightings; all of the cases were in the Air Force reports. Wh en it came to the Mantell case, I stuck to published estimates of the strange o bject's size; a mysterious ship 250 to 30 0 feet in diameter was s tartling enough. At first, I chose Mars to illustrate o ur space e xplorations. But Mars had been associated with the Orson W elles s tampede. Most discussions of the planet had a menacing note, perhaps because o f its warlike name. In the e nd, I switched to a planet of Wolf 35 9. The thought of those e ight light-years would have a comforting effect on any nervous readers. The chance o f any mass visitation would seem remote, if not impossible. But it would still put across the space-travel story. As f inally revised, the article, w ritten un der my byline, stated the following points as the conclusions reached by T rue: 1. For the past 175 years, the e arth h as been un der systematic c lose-range examination by living, intelligent observers from another p lanet. 2. The intensity of this observation, and the frequency of the visits to the earth's atm osphere, have increased markedly during the past two years. 3. The vehicles used for this observation and for interplanetary transport by the e xplorers have been classed as follows: Ty pe I, a small, nonpilot-carrying"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"disk-s haped cr aft equipp ed with some form of television or impulse transmitter; Ty pe II, a very large, metallic, disk-s haped aircraft operating on the helicopter pr inciple; Ty pe III , a dirigible-shaped, wingless aircraft t hat, in the Earth's atm osphere, operates in conformance with the Prandtl theory of lift. 4. The discernible patterns of observation and exploration shown by the so-called flying disks varies in no important particular from well-developed American plans f or the e xploration of s pace, expected to come to fruition within the next fifty y ears. There is reason to believe, however, that some other r ace o f thinking beings is a matter of two and a q uarter c enturies ahead of us. Following these points, I added a b rief comm ent on the possibility of guided missiles, add ing that t he Air Force had c onvincingly denied this as an explanation of any sightings. As Purdy had suggested, I carefully omitted ten minor c ases that I thought m ight be linked with guided-missile research. If disclosing the facts ab out space travel helped to divert attention from any secret tests, so much the better. \"True accepts the o fficial denial of any secret device,\" I stated, \"because the weight of the e vidence, especially the world-wide sightings, does not support such a belief.\" Most readers, of course, w ould know that some guided-missile e xperiments were going on, and that True was f ully aware o f it. But our main purpose would be achieved. The fact t hat t he e arth had been observed by beings f rom another p lanet would be fully presented. So me readers, of course, would r eject even the fact that the saucers existed. O thers would c ling to the idea that t hey were o f earthly origin. But t he mass of evidence would make most readers think. At the very least, it would p lant one strong suggestion: that we, men and women of the e arth, are not the o nly intelligent species in the universe.

The press release was dated December 27 , 1949 . Without m entioning T rue, the Air Force flatly denied having any evidence that flying saucers exist.

A mild form of mass hysteria or \"war nerves.\" 3. Individuals who fab ricate such reports to perpetrate a hoax or to seek publicity. Evaluation of the reports of un identified flying objects, said the Air Force, demonstrates that t hey constitute no direct threat t o the national security of the United States. Then came the clincher: Project \" Saucer,\" said the Air Force, had been discontinu ed, now that all the reports had been explained. It was plain that the release had been hastily prepared. It completely contradicted the detailed Project \"Saucer\" report, issued eight m onths before, that had c alled for constant vigilance, after admitting that most important"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"cases were un solved. Anyone familiar with the situation would see the discrepancy at once. From Washington I flew to New York, w here I found True in a turmoil. Long-distance calls were pouring in.

Less than 5 per c ent of the readers ridiculed the article. Between 15 a nd 20 per c ent said they were not convinced; a few of these admitted they could not refute the e vidence. About half the readers accepted the possibility; most of these said they saw no reason why other p lanets s hould not be inh abited. The remainder, between 25 a nd 30 per c ent, said they were completely convinced. Even the disbelievers asked for more information. The intelligence level of the average letter was gratifyingly high.

Se veral confidential tips had c ome in when I arrived. Most of them were from usually reputab le sources. We were given evidence that Project \"Saucer\" was still i n operation; since its true code name was not \" Saucer,\" it could be continu ed without violating the Air Force press release. This same information was received from a dozen sources within the next two weeks. We were also told that there had been 722 cases, instead of 375 . Meantime, a nu mber of astronomers had c ome o ut with statements, pro and con. O ne o f these was Dr. D ean B. McLaughlin, of the University of Michigan. \"No o ne knows what t he saucers are as yet,\" Dr. Mc Laughlin said. \"They could be anything, and I'm willi ng to be convinced once the e vidence is presented.\" Dr. Bart J.

Within a few days we had a hu ge stack of clipp ings, some supp orting True, some deriding us. In the midst of all this, I read scientists' c omm ents on Einstein's new un ified-field theory, which h ad been printed about t he time True appeared on the stands. A discussion by L incoln Barnett, author of The Universe and Dr. Einstein, explained the ba sic pr emise — that gravitation and electromagnetic force are inseparable. As I read it, I thought of what Redell had said. If gravitation were a manifestation of electromagnetic force, was it possible that an advanced r ace had found a way — as unique as splitting the atom — to o ffs et gravity and utilize that force? It was during these first tense days that we ran down the Wh ite Sands s tory. This also e nded another p uzz le — the identity of the magazine that we had feared might scoop us. The race had been closer than we knew. The e ditors of a national magazine had learned of Commander Mc Laughlin and the sightings at Wh ite S ands. Two o f the staff had carefully investigated the details. Convinced that t he report was accurate, they had p lanned to run the story in an early issue. Since True had app eared first with the space-travel story, the e ditors agreed to release the McLaughlin report for use in our M arch issue. The ba sic facts were in close agreement with what Redell had told me. The e llipsoid-shaped saucer had been tracked at a height of 56 miles, its speed 5 miles per second. This was 18,000 miles per hour, even faster than Redell had said. The strange craft, 10 5 feet in length, had climbed as swiftly as Marvin Miles had d escribed it • an increase in altitude o f ab out 25 miles in 10 seconds. Comm ander Mc Laughlin stated in h is article that he was convinced the object was a space ship from another p lanet, operated by animate, intelligent beings. He also described two small circular objects, ab out t wenty inches in diameter, that streaked up beside a Navy high-altitude missile. After maneuvering aroun d it for a moment, both disks accelerated, passed the fast-moving Navy missile, and d isapp eared. It is Commander Mc Laughlin's opinion that t he saucers come from Mars. Pointing out t hat Mars was in a good p osition to see o ur surface o n July 16, 194 5, he believes that t he flash of the first A-bomb, at Alamogordo Base, a point not far from Wh ite S ands, w as caught by powerful telescopes."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"During the first week of Ja nu ary, I app eared on \"We, the People,\" with Lieutenant George Gorman. Wh en I saw G orman, before rehearsals, he seemed odd ly constrained. I had a feeling that he had been warned ab out talking freely. D uring rehearsals, he changed his lines in the script. Wh en the writers argued over a point, G orman told them: \"I can say only what was in my published r eport — nothing else.\" The day before the broadcast, a program official told me they had been told to include the Air Force denial in the script. That afternoon I learned that the Air Force planned to monitor the broadcast. Meantime, an A.P. story carried a new Air Force announ cement. Formerly secret Project \" Saucer\" files would be o pened to newsmen at t he Pentagon, giving the answers to all the saucer reports. Just after my return to Washington, I saw an I.N.S. story that was widely printed. It was an interview w ith Major Jerry Boggs, a Project \" Saucer\" Intelligence o fficer who served as liaison man between Wright Field and the Pentagon. Major Boggs had been asked for specific answers to the Mantell, Chiles-Wh itted, and Gorman cases. The answers he gave amazed me. I picked up the phone and c alled the Air Force Press Branch. After some delay, I was told that Major Boggs was being briefed for assignment to Germany. An interview w ould be almost impossible. \"He wasn't too busy to talk with I.N.S.,\" I said. \"All I want is thirty minutes.\" Later, Jack Shea, a civilian press official I had known for some time, arranged for the meeting. I was also to talk with General So ry Smith, D eputy Director for Air Information. Major Jesse Stay, a Press Branch officer, took me to General Smith's office for the interview. Both Jesse and Jack Shea, pleasant, obliging chaps who had helped me in the past, tried earnestly to convince me the saucers didn't exist. Jesse was s till trying when Major Boggs came in. Boggs looked to be in h is twenties, younger than I had expected. He was trim, well built, w ith a quietly alert face. Two rows of ribb ons testified to his wartime service. When Jesse S tay introduced me, Boggs gave me a curiously searching look. It could have been merely his usual way of appr aising people he met. But all through our talk, I had a strong feeling that he was on his guard."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"I had written out some questions, but first I mentioned the I.N.S. story. \"Were you quoted c orrectly on the Mantell case?\" I asked. \"Yes, I was.\" Major Boggs looked me squarely in the e ye. \"Captain Mantell was chasing the planet Venu s.\" It was s o incredible that I shook my head. \"Major, Venu s; w as practically invisible that day. We've checked with astronomers. Is that the o fficial Air Force answer?\" \"Yes, it is,\" Boggs said. His eyes never left my face. I glanced across at General So ry Smith, then back at the intelligence major. \"That's a flat contradiction of Project 'Saucer's' report. Last April, after they had c hecked for fifteen months, they said p ositively it was not Venus. It was still un identified.\" Boggs s aid, in a slow, un ruffled voice, \"They rechecked after that report.\" \"Wh y did they recheck, after fifteen months?\" I asked him. \"'They must have gone o ver those figures long before that, for errors.\" If my question ann oyed him, Boggs gave no sign. There's no o ther p ossible answer,\" he said. \"Mantell was chasing Venu s.\" ~"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"CHAPTER XVII FOR A MOMENT after Boggs's last answer, I had an impulse to e nd the interview. I had a feeling I was facing a sphinx — a q uiet, courteous s phinx in an Air Force un iform. I was s ure now w hy Major Jerry Boggs had been chosen for his job, the all-important connecting link with the project at Wright Field. No o ne would ever catch this man off guard, no matter what secret was given him to conceal. And it was more than the result of Air Force Intelligence training. His mann er, his voice carried c onviction. He would have convinced anyone who had not carefully analyzed the Godman Field tragedy. I made o ne more attempt. \"Do the Godman Field witnesses — Colonel Hix and the rest — believe the Venu s answer?\" \"I haven't asked them,\" said Boggs, \"so I couldn't say.\" \"Wh at ab out t he Chiles-Wh itted c ase?\" I asked. \"You were quoted as s aying they saw a meteor — a b olide that exploded in a shower of sparks.\" \"That's right,\" said Boggs. \"And Gorman was chasing a lighted ba lloon?\" Again the Intelligence major nodd ed. I pointed, out that all three o f the cases mentioned had been listed as un identified in the April report. \"They'd had those cases for months,\" I said. \"What new facts did they learn?\" Boggs s aid calmly, \"They just m ade a final analysis, and those were the answers.\" We looked at each other a moment. Major Boggs patiently waited. I began to realize how a lawyer must feel with an imperturba ble witness. And Boggs's un failing courtesy began to make me e mba rrassed. \"Major,\" I said, \"I hope you'll realize this is not a personal matter. As an Intelligence o fficer, if you're told to give certain answers — \" He smiled for the first time. \"That's all right — but I'm not hiding a thing. There's just no such thing as a flying saucer, so far as we've foun d out.\""},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"\"We've been told,\" I said, \"that Project 'Saucer' isn't closed — that you just changed its code name.\" \"That's not so,\" Boggs s aid emphatically. \"The contracts are e nded, and all personn el transferred to o ther d uty.\" \"Then the announ cement wasn't caused by T rue's article?\" Both General Smith and M ajor Jesse S tay shook their heads quickly. Boggs leaned forward, eyeing me e arnestly. \"As a matter of fact, w e'd finished the investigation months ago — aroun d the end of August, or early in September. We just hadn't got aroun d to ann ouncing it.\" \"Last October,\" I said, \"I was told the investigation was still going on. They said there were no new answers to the cases just m entioned.\" \"The Press Branch h adn't been informed yet,\" Boggs explained simply. \"It seems very strange to me,\" I said. \"In April, the Air Force called for vigilance by the civilian population. It said the project was young, much of its work s till un der way.\" Jesse S tay interrupted before Boggs could r eply. \"Don, the Press Branch will have to take the blame for that. The report wasn't carefully checked. There were several loose statements in it.\" This was an incredible statement. I was sure Jesse knew it. \"But the case reports you quoted c ame from Wright Field. As of April twenty-seventh, 19 49, all the major c ases were o fficially unsolved. Then in August or early Se ptember, the whole thing's cleaned up, from what Major Boggs s ays. That's pretty hard to believe.\" No o ne answered that one. Major Boggs was waiting politely for the next question. I picked up my list. The rest of the interview w as in straight question-and-answer style: Q.

Have any reports been received at Wright Field since Project \" Saucer\" closed? There was a case after that date, an airliner crew — At this point, Major Jesse Stay broke in. \"It's all up to the local comm anders now. If they want t o receive reports of anything un usual, all right. And if they want to investigate them, that's up to each comm ander. But no Project 'Saucer' teams will check on reports. That's all ended.\" There at t he last, it had been a little. like a courtroom scene, and I was glad the interview w as over. Major Boggs was unruffled as ever. I apologized for the ba rrage o f questions, and thanked him for being so decent ab out it. \"It was interesting, getting y our viewpoint,\" he said. He smiled, still the courteous s phinx, and went on out. After Bogs had left, I talked with General Smith alone. I told him I was not convinced, \"I'd like to see the complete files on these cases I mentioned,\" I explained. \"Also, I'd like to talk with the last comm anding officer or senior Intelligence officer attached to Project 'Saucer.'\" \"I'm not sure ab out the senior officer,\" General Smith answered. \"He may have been detached already. But I don't see any reason why you can't see those files. I'll phone Wright Field and c all you.\" I was ab out to leave, but he motioned for me to sit down. \"I can un derstand how you feel ab out the Mantell report,\" General Smith said earnestly. \"I knew Tomm y Mantell very well. And Colonel Hix is a classmate o f mine. I knew neither one was the kind to have hallucinations. That case got m e, at first.\" \"You believe Venu s is the true answer?\" I asked him. He seemed surpr ised. \"It m ust be, if Wright Field says s o.\" Wh en I went ba ck to the Press Branch, I asked Jack Shea for the case-report summ aries that Boggs had mentioned, He got them for me — two collections of"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"loose-leaf mimeographed sheets enclosed in black binders. So these were the \"secret files\"! Across the hall, in the press room, I opened one book at random. The first thing I saw w as this: \"A meteorologist should c ompute the appr oximate e nergy required to evaporate as much cloud as shown in the incident 26 photographs.\" Major Boggs had said there were no important pictures. I tucked the binders un der my arm and went out t o my car. Perhaps these books hinted at more than Boggs had r ealized. But that didn't seem likely. As liaison man, he should know all the answers. I was almost positive that he did. But I was equally sure they weren't the answers he had given me. ~"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"CHAPTER XVIII THAT NIGHT I went t hrough the Project \"Saucer\" summ ary of cases. It was a strange e xperience. The first report I checked was the Mantell case. Nothing that Boggs had said had changed my firm opinion. I knew the answer was not Venus, and I was certain Boggs knew it, too. The Godman Field incident was listed as Case 33 . The report also touches on the Lockbourne Air Base sighting. As already described, the same mysterious object, or a similar one, was seen moving at five hun dred miles an h our over Lockbourne Field. It was also sighted at other p oints in Ohio. The very first sentence in Case 33 showed a determined attempt t o e xplain away the o bject that Mantell chased: \"Detailed attention should be given to any possible astronomical body or phenomenon which might serve to identify the o bject or objects.\" (So me o f the final Project report on Mantell has been given in an earlier chapter. I am repeating a few paragraphs below, to help in weighing Major Boggs's answer.) These are o fficial statements of the Project astronomer: \"On Janu ary 7, 19 48, Venu s was less than h alf its f ull brilli ance. However, un der exceptionally good atm ospheric c onditions, and with the e ye shielded from t he direct rays of the sun, Venu s might be seen as an exceedingly tiny bright point of light. It is possible to see it in daytime when one knows exactly where to look. O f course, the chances of looking at the right spot are very few. \"It has been un officially reported that the o bject was a Navy cosmic r ay ba lloon. If this can be e stab lished it is to be preferred as an explanation. However, if reports f rom other localities refer to the same o bject, any such device must have been a good many miles high — 25 to 50 — in order to have been seen clearly, almost simultaneously, from places 175 miles apart.\" This absolutely ruled out t he ba lloon possibility, as the investigator fully realized. That he must have considered the space-ship answer at this point is strongly indicated in the following sentence:"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"\"If all reports were o f a single o bject, in the knowledge o f this investigator no man-made o bject could have been large e nough and far enough away for the appr oximate simultaneous s ightings.\" The next paragraph of this Project \"Saucer\" report practically nu llified M ajor Boggs's s tatement that Venu s was the sole e xplanation: \"It is most unlikely, however, that so many separate persons should at t hat time have chanced on Venu s in the daylight sky. It seems therefore much more probab le that more than one o bject was involved. The sighting might have included two o r more ba lloons ( or aircraft) or they might have included Venu s (in the fatal chase) and ba lloons. . . . Such a hypothesis, however, does still necessitate the inclusion of at least two o ther objects than Venu s, and it certainly is coincidental that so many people would have chosen this one day to be confused (to the e xtent of reporting the matter) by normal airborne objects. . . .\" Farther on in the summ aries, I found a report t hat has an extremely significant bearing on the Mantell case. This was Case 17 5, in which the same consultant attempts to e xplain a strange daylight sighting at Santa Fe, New Mexico. One o f the S anta Fe o bservers described the mysterious aerial object as roun d and extremely bright, \"like a dime in the sky.\" Here is what the Project \"Saucer\" investigator had to say: \"The magnitude o f Venu s was -3.8 (appr oximately the same as on Janu ary 7, 194 8). it could have been visible in the daylight sky. It would have appeared, however, more like a pinpoint of brilli ant light than 'like a dime in the sky.' It seems un likely that it would be noticed at all. . . . Considering discrepancies in the two reports, I suggest t he moon in a gibb ous phase; in daytime this is unu sual and most people are not used to it, so that t hey fail to identify it. Wh ile this hypothesis has little to correspond to e ither r eport, it is worth mentioning. \"It seems far more probab le that some type o f balloon was the o bject in this case.\" Both the Godman Field and the S anta Fe cases were almost identical, so far as the visibility of Venu s was concerned. In the S anta Fe case, which h ad very little publicity, Project \" Saucer\" dropp ed the Venu s explanation as a practically impossible answer. But in Case 33, it had tried d esperately to make Venu s loom up as a hu ge gleaming object during Mantell's fatal chase."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"There was only one e xplanation: Project \"Saucer\" m ust have known the truth from t he start-that Mantell had p ursued a tremendous s pace ship. That fact alone, if it had exploded in the headlines at t hat time, might have caused dangerous panic. To make it worse, Captain Mantell had been killed. Even if he had actually died from blacking out while trying to follow the swiftly ascending space ship, few w ould have believed it. The story would spread like wildfire: Spacemen kill an American Air Force Pilot! This explained the tight lid that had been clamped down at once o n the Mantell case. It was more than a year before that policy had been changed; then the first official discussions of possible space visitors had begun to app ear. True's plans to ann ounce the interplanetary answer would have fitted a program of preparing the people. But t he Air Force had not expected such nation-wide reaction from True's article; that m uch I knew. Evidently, they had not suspected such a detailed analysis of the Godman Field c ase, in particular. I could see now why Boggs, Jesse S tay, and the o thers had tried so hard to convince me that we had made a mistake. It was quite possible that we had r evived that first Air Force fear of dangerous publicity. But Mantell had been dead for two years. News stories would not have the same impact now, even if they did r eport t hat spacemen had d owned the pilot. And I doubted that t here would be headlines. Unless the Air Force supplied some convincing details, the mann er of his death would still be speculation. App arently I had been right; this case was the key to the ridd le. It had been the first m ajor sighting in 1948 . Project \" Saucer\" had been started imm ediately afterward. In searching for a plausible answer, which could be published if needed, officials had p robab ly set t he pattern for handling all other reports, \"Explaining away\" would be a logical program, until the public could be prepared for an official announ cement. As I went t hrough other c ase reports, I found increasing evidence to ba ck up this belief. Case 1, the Muroc Air Base sightings, had p lainly baffled Project m en seeking a plausible answer. Because o f the Air Force witnesses, they could not ignore the reports. Highly trained Air Force test pilots and groun d officers had seen two fast-moving silver-coloured d isks circling over the base. Flying at speeds of f rom t hree to four hundred miles an hour, the disks"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"whirled in amazingly tight m anoeuvers. Since they were o nly eight thousand feet ab ove the field, these turns could be clearly seen. \"It is tempting to e xplain the o bject as ordinary aircraft observed un der unu sual li ght conditions,\" t he case report reads. \"But the e vidence o f tight circles, if maintained, is s trongly contradictory.\" Although Case 1 was technically in the \"unexplained\" group, Wright Field had made a final effort t o e xplain away the reports. Said the Air M ateriel Comm and: \"The sightings were the result of misinterpr etation of real stimuli, probab ly research ba lloons.\" In all the world's history, there is no record of a three-hundred-mile-an-hour wind. To cover the distance involved, the drifting balloons would have had to move at this s peed, or faster. If a three-hun dred-mile wind had been blowing at eight t housand feet, nothing on earth could have stood it, Muroc Air Base would have been blown off the map. Wh at did the Muroc test pilots really see that day? Wh ile searching for the Chiles-Wh itted r eport, ran across the Fairfield Suisan mystery-light case, which I had learned about in Seattle. This was Case 215. The Project \"Saucer\" comm ent reads: \"If the o bservations were e xactly as s tated by the witnesses, the ba ll of light could not be a fireball. . . . A fireba ll would not have come into view at 1,000 feet and risen to 20,000 . If correct, there is no astronomical explanation. Under unu sual conditions, a fireba ll might appear to rise somewhat as a result of perspective. The ab sence o f trail and soun d d efinitely does not favour the meteor hypothesis, but . . . does not rule it out finally. It does not seem likely any meteor or auroral phenomenon could be as bright as this.\" Then came o ne o f the most revealing lines in all the case reports: \"In the almost hopeless ab sence o f any other natural explanation, one must consider the possibility of the o bject's having been a meteor, even though the description does not fit very well.\" One air-base o fficer, I recalled, had insisted that the o bject had been a lighted ba lloon. Checking the secret report from t he Air Weather Se rvice, I foun d this:"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"\"Case 2 15 . Very high winds, 60 -70 miles per hour from southwest, all levels. Definitely prohibits any ba lloon from southerly motion.\" This case is officially listed as answered. In Case 19 , w here a cigar-shaped object was s een at Dayton, O hio, the Project investigator made a valiant attempt to fit an answer: \"Possibly a close pair of fireba lls, but it seems unlikely. If one were to stretch the description to its very limits and make allowances f or untrained observers, he could say that t he cigar-like shape might have been illusion caused by rapid motion, and that t he bright sunlight m ight have made both the o bjects and the trails nearly invisible. \"This investigator d oes not prefer that interpolation, and it should he resorted to o nly if all other p ossible e xplanations fail.\" This case, too, is officially listed as answered. Case 24 , w hich occurred Jun e 12, 19 47, twelve days before the Arnold sighting, shows the same determined attempt t o find an explanation, no matter how farfetched. In this case, two fast-moving objects were seen at Weiser, Idaho, Twice they appr oached the e arth, then swiftly circled upward. The Project investigator tried hard to prove that these might have been parts of a double fireba ll. But at the e nd, he said, \"In spite o f all this, this investigator would prefer a terrestrial explanation for the incident.\" It was plain that t his report had not been planned originally for release to the public. No Project investigator would have been so frank. With each n ew report, I was more and more convinced that t hese had been confidential discussions of various possible answers, circulated between Project \"Saucer\" officials. Wh y they had been released now w as s till a puzzle, though I began to see a glimm er of the answer. The Chiles-Wh itted sighting was listed as Case 14 4. As I started on the report, I wondered if Major Boggs's \"bolide\" answer would have any more foun dation than these o ther \"astronomical\" cases. The report began with these words: \"There is no astronomical explanation, if we accept t he report at face value. But the sheer improba bility of the facts as s tated, particularly in the absence"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"of any known aircraft in the vicinity, makes it necessary to see whether any other explanation, even though farfetched, can be considered.\" After this candid admission of his intentions, the Project consultant earnestly attempts to fit the two pilots' space ship d escription to a slow-moving meteor. \"It will have to be left to the psychologists,\" he goes on, \"to tell us whether the imm ediate trail of a bright m eteor c ould p roduce the subjective impression of a ship with lighted windows. Considering only the Chiles-Wh itted sighting, the hypothesis s eems very improbab le.\" As I mentioned in an earlier c hapter, observers at Robbins Air Force Base, Macon, G eorgia, saw the same mysterious object streak overhead, trailing varicoloured flames. This was about one hour before Chiles and Whitted saw the o nrushing space ship. To bolster up the meteor theory, the Project consultant suggests a one-hour error in time. The e xplanation: The airliner would be o n daylight-saving time. \"If there is no time difference,\" he proceeds, \"the. object m ust have been an extraordinary meteor. . . . in which case it would have covered the distance from Macon to Montgomery in a minute o r two.\" Having checked the time angle before, I knew this was incorrect. Both reports were given in eastern standard time. And in a later p art of the Project report, the consultant admits this f act. But he has an alternate answer: \"If the difference in time is real, the o bject was s ome form of k nown aircraft, regardless of its bizarre nature.\" The \"bizarre nature\" is not specified. Nor d oes the Project \"Saucer\" report try to fit t he Robbins Field description to any earth-made aircraft. The air-base observers were struck by the o bject's hu ge size, its projectile-like shape, and the weird flames trailing behind. Except for the double-deck windows, the air-ba se men's description tallied with the pilots'. With the ship at five thousand feet or higher, its windows would not have been visible from t he groun d. All the o bservers agreed on the o bject's very high speed. Neither of the Project \"Saucer\" alternate answers will fit the facts. 1. The o ne-hour interval has been proved c orrect. Therefore, as the Project consultant admits, it could not be a meteor. 2. The Robbins Field witnesses have flatly denied it was a conventional"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"plane. The Air Force screened 225 airplane schedules, and pr oved there was no such plane in the area. No o rdinary aircraft would have caused the brilli ant streak that startled the DC-3 passenger and both of the pilots. Major Boggs's bolide answer had gone the way of his Venus explanation. I wondered if the Gorman light-ba lloon solution would fade o ut the same way. But the Project report on Gorman (Case 172 ) merely hinted at the balloon answer. In the App endix, there was a b rief comm ent: \"Note that standard 30 inch and 65 inch weather ba lloons have vertical speeds of 60 0 and 1100 feet per minu te, respectively.\" In all the reports I have mentioned, and on through both the case books, one thing was immediately obvious. All the testimony, all the actual evidence was missing. These were o nly the declared c onclusions of Project \" Saucer.\" Wh ether they matched the actual conclusions in Wright Field secret files there was no way of k nowing. But even in these sketch reports, I found some o dd hints, clues to what Project officials might really be thinking. After an analysis of two Indianapolis cases, one investigator r eports: \"Barring hallucination, these two incidents and 17 , 75 a nd 84 seem t he most tangible from t he standp oint of description, of all those reported, and the most difficult to e xplain away as s heer nonsense.\" Case 17, I found, w as that of Kenn eth Arnold. But in spite o f the above admission that t his case cann ot be e xplained away, it is officially listed as answered. Case 75 struck a familiar note. This was the strange o ccurrence at Twin Falls, Idaho, on which True had had a tip months before. A disk moving through a canyon at t remendous s peed had whipped the treetops as if by a violent hu rricane. The report was brief, but one sentence stood out with a startling effect: \"Twin Falls, Idaho, August 13 , 1847 ,\" the report began. \"There is clearly nothing astronomical in this incident. . . . Two points stand out, the sky-blue colour, and the fact t hat t he trees 'spun around on top as if they were in a vacuu m.'\" Then came the sentence that made me sit up in my chair."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"\"App arently it m ust be classed with the o ther bona fide disk sightings.\" The o ther bona fide sightings! Was this a slip? Or had the Air Force deliberately left t his report in the file? If they had, w hat was ba ck of it — what was ba ck of releasing all of these telltale case summ aries? I skimmed through the rest as quickly as possible looking for other c lues. Here are a few of the things that. caught m y eye: Case 10 .

Going ba ck over this group of cases, I made an incredible discovery: All but three o f these unsolved c ases were o fficially listed as answered. The three were the United Airlines case, the Wh ite S ands s ightings, and the double-decked space-ship r eport from The Hague. Going ba ck to the first report, I checked all the summ aries. Ni ne times out of ten, the e xplanations were pure conjecture. So metimes no answer was even attempted. Although 375 cases were mentioned, the summ aries ended with Case 244 . Se veral cases were o mitted. I foun d c lues to some o f these in the secret Air Weather Se rvice report, including the mysterious \"green light\" sightings at Las Vegas and Albuquerque. Of the remaining 228 cases, Project \"Saucer\" lists all but 34 a s explained. These un solved cases are brought up again for a final attempt at explaining them away. In the app endix, the Air Materiel Comm and c arefully states: \"It is not the intent to discredit t he character of observers, but each case has un desirab le e lements and these can't be disregarded.\" After this perfun ctory g esture, the A.M.C. proceeds to discredit completely the testimony of highly trained Air Force test pilots and officers at Muroc. (The 300-400 m.p.h. research ba lloon explanation.) The A.M.C. then brushes off the report of Captain Emil Smith and the crew of a United Airline plane. On July 4, 1947 , nine hu ge flying disks were coun ted by Captain Smith and his crew. The strange o bjects were in sight for ab out t welve minutes; the crew w atched them for the e ntire period and described them in detail l ater."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Despite Project \" Saucer's\" admission that it had no answer, the A.M.C. contrived one. Ignoring the e vidence o f veteran airline pilots, it said: \"Since the sighting occurred at sun set, w hen illusory effect are most likely, the o bjects could have been ordinary aircraft, ba lloons, birds, or p ure illusion.\" In only three cases did the A.M.C. admit it had no answer. Even h ere, it was implied that the witnesses were e ither c onfused or incompetent. In its press release o f December 27, 19 49, the Air Force had mentioned 375 cases. It implied that all of these were answered. The truth was just t he reverse, as was proved by these case books. Almost t wo hun dred c ases s till were shown to be unsolved-although the real answers might be hidd en in Wright Field files. These two black books puzz led me. Wh y had the Air Force lifted its s ecrecy on these case summ aries? Wh y had M ajor Boggs given me those answers, when these books would flatly refute them? I thought I new the reason n ow but t here was only one way to make sure. The actual Wright Field files s hould tell the answer. Wh en I phoned General So ry Smith, his voice soun ded a little peculiar. \"I called Wright Field,\" he said. \"But t hey said you wouldn't find anything of value o ut there.\" \"You mean they refused to let m e see their files?\" \"No, I didn't say that. But they're short of personn el. They don't want to take people o ff other jobs to look up the records.\" \"I won't need any help,\" I said. \"Major Boggs s aid each case had a separate book. If they'd just show me the shelves, I could d o the job in two days.\" There was a long silence. \"I'll ask them again,\" the General said finally. \"Call me sometime next week.\" I said I would, and hu ng up. The message from Wright Field hadn't surpr ised me. But Smith's changed manner did. He had soun ded odd ly disturbed. Wh ile I was waiting for Wright Field's answer, Ken Purdy phoned. He told"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"me that staff men from Time and Life magazines were seriously checking on the \"little men\" story. Both Purdy and I were sure this was a colossal hoax, but t here was just a faint chance that someone had been on the fringe o f a real happ ening and had made up the rest of the story. They key man in the story seemed to be o ne George Koehler, of Denver, Colorado. The morning after Purdy called, I took a plane to Denver. During the flight I went over the \"little men\" story again. It had been printed in over a hundred p apers. According to the usual version, G eorge Koehler had accidentally learned of two crashed saucers at a radar station on our southwest border. The ships were made o f s ome strange metal. The cabin was s tationary, placed within a large rotating ring. Here is the story as it was told in the Kansas City Star: In flight, the ring revolved at a high rate o f s peed, w hile the cab in remained stationary like the centre o f a gyroscope. Each of the two ships s een by Koehler were o ccupied by a crew of two. In the ba dly damaged ship, these bodies were charred so badly that little could be learned from t hem. The o ccupants of the o ther ship, w hile dead when they were foun d, w ere not burned or d isfigured, and, w hen Koehler saw them, were in a perfect state o f preservation. Medical reports, according to Koehler, showed that these men were almost identical with earth-dwelling hu mans, except for a few minor differences. They were o f a un iform height of three feet, w ere un iformly blond, beardless, and their teeth were completely free o f filli ngs or c avities. They did not wear un dergarments, but had their bodies taped. The ships s eemed to be magnetically controlled and p owered. In add ition to a piece o f metal, Koehler had a clock or automatic c alendar taken from one o f the crafts. Koehler said that the best assumption as to the source o f the ships was the planet Venu s. Wh en I arrived at Denver, I went to the radio station where Koehler worked. I told him t hat if he had p roof that we could pr int, we would buy the story. As the first substantial proof, I asked to see the piece o f strange metal he was supp osed to have. K oehler said it had been sent t o another c ity to be"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"analysed. I asked to see pictures of the crashed saucers. These, too, proved to be somewhere e lse. So did the queer \"space clock\" t hat Koehler was said to have. By this time I was sure it was all a gag. I had the feeling that Koehler, back of his mann er of s eeming indignation at m y demands, w as hugely enjoying himself. I cut the interview short and c alled Ken Purdy in New York. \"Well, thank God that's laid to rest,\" he said when I told him. But even though the \"little men\" story had turned out-as expected — a dud, Koehler had d one me a good turn. An old friend, Willi am E. Barrett, well-known fiction writer, now lived in Denver. Thanks to Koehler's gag, I had a pleasant visit with Bill and his family. On the trip ba ck, I bought a paper at the Chicago airport. O n an inside page I ran across Koehler's name. According to the A.P., he had just admitted the whole thing was a b ig joke. But in spite o f this, the \"little men\" story g oes on and on. App arently not even Koehler c an stop it now. ~"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"CHAPTER XIX FOR TWO WEE KS after my return to Washington, G eneral So ry Smith h eld off a final answer ab out m y trip to Wright Field. Meantime, K en Purdy had called him ba cking my request to see the Project files. It was obvious to me that Wright Field was determined not to o pen the files. But the General was trying to avoid making it official. \"Wh y can't you accept m y word there's nothing to the saucers?\" he asked me one day. \"You're impeaching my personal veracity.\" But finally he saw there was no o ther way out. He told me I had been officially refused p ermission to see the Wright Field files. So me time later, Ken Purdy phoned General Smith. \"General, if the Air Force wants to talk to us off the record, w e'll play ba ll. True will either handle it from t hen on whatever way you think best or we'll keep still.\" Wh ether this offer was relayed higher up, I don't know. But nothing came o f it. Meantime, saucer reports had begun to come in from all over the coun try. So me e ven came from ab road. So me o f these 1950 sightings have already been mentioned in early chapters. Besides the strange affair at Tucson on February 1, there were several other cases in February. Three o f these were in So uth America. O ne saucer was reported near the naval air station at Alameda, California. So me were sighted in Texas, New Mexico, and other parts of the So uthwest. In March, the wave o f s ightings reached such a height t hat t he Air Force again denied the saucers' existence. This followed a report t hat a flying disk had cr ashed near M exico City and that t he wreckage had been viewed by U. S. Air Force o fficials. Scores of Orangeburg, So uth Carolina, residents watched a disk that hovered over that city on March 10 . It was described as s ilver-bright, turning slowly in the air before it disappeared. The day before this, residents of Van Nuys, California, saw a b right disk moving swiftly four hun dred feet in the air. See n through a telescope, it app eared to be fifty feet in diameter."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Disks were reported at numerous places in Mexico, including Guadalaja ra, Juárez, Mazatlán, and Durango. On the twelfth of March, the crew and passengers of an American Airlines s hip saw a large gleaming disk high ab ove Monterrey airport in Mexico. Captain W. R. Hun t, the senior airline pilot, w atched the disk through a theodolite at t he airport. This disk and most of the o thers s een in Mexico were similar in description to the o ne sighted at Dayton, O hio, on March 8. This was the large metallic saucer that hovered high over Vandalia Airport, un til Air Force and National Guard fighters raced up after it. The disk rose vertically into the sky at incredible speed, hovered a while longer, and then vanished. Within twenty-four hours this mystery disk had been \"identified\" as the planet Venu s. (It was broad d aylight.) Newspapers quoted \"trained astronomical officials in Dayton\" as the source for this explanation. Meanwhile the Mexican government newspaper, El N acional, quoted \"a famous and reputable astronomer\" as saying the numerous disks reported over M exico \"carry visitors from Mars.\" One o f the strangest reports came from the naval air station at Dallas, Texas. It was ab out 11:30 A.M. on March 16 when CPO Charles Lewis s aw a disk streak up at a B-36 b omber. The disk appeared ab out twenty to twenty-five feet in diameter, Lewis reported. Racing at incredible speed, it shot up un der the bomber, hun g there for a second, then broke away at a 45 -degree angle. Following this, it shot straight up into the air and d isapp eared. Captain M. A. Nation, C. O. of the station, said it was \"I the second r eport in ten days. On March 7, said Captain Nation, a tower c ontrol operator named C. E. Edmun dson saw a similar d isk f lying so fast it was almost a b lur. \"He e stimated its s peed at t hree thousand to four thousand miles per hour,\" Captain Nation stated. \"Of course, he had no instruments to compute the speed, so that's a pure e stimate.\" It was s ome time before this when I heard the first crazy rumour ab out the guided-missile display. This s tory, w hich h ad new details every time I heard it described the Air Force as refusing to let the Navy announ ce a new type o f missile. According to the rumours, the Air Force was trying to prove its own missile far superior, to keep the Navy from invading its long-range bombing domain. Then the Army joined the pitched battle with still a third guided missile, according to the rumours."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"And the flying disks ? Army, Navy, and Air Force missiles, laun ched in droves all over the country to prove whose was the best? A public missile race, w ith the joint Chiefs of Staff to decide the winn er! It seems fantastic that t his theory would be believed by any intelligent person. In effect, it accuses the armed services of deliberate, criminal negligence, of endangering milli ons in the cities below. I am convinced that some o f these rumours led to at least one o f the published guesses ab out our missile program. O ne widely publicized story stated that t he flying saucers s een hu rtling through our skies are actually two types of secret weapons. O ne, according to radio and newspaper accoun ts, is a disk that whizzes through space, halts s uspended in the air, soars to thirty thousand feet, drops to o ne thousand feet, and then usually disintegrates in the air. These saucers, it was said, ranged from 20 inches to 250 feet in diameter. They were supp osed to be pilotless — and harmless. The second type was said to be a j et version of the Navy's circular airfoil \"Flying Flapjack.\" It was credited with fantastic speed. The \"true disks ,\" however, w ere mainly Air Force devices, according to the report. \"So me are guided, others are not,\" said the radio commentator who released this s tory. \"They can stay stationary, dash off to right or left, and move like lightning. But they are utterly harmless.\" In these \"harmless\" disks there was s upp osed to be an explosive charge that destroyed them in mid-air at a predetermined time. Within a few days after this s tory was broadcast, the United States News and World Report declared that t he saucers are real, and identified them as jet models of Navy \"Flying F lapjacks.\" This magazine, w hich is not an official publication despite its name, mentioned the variab le-direction jet principle that I had p reviously described in the True article. These two flying-saucer \"explanations\" brought denials f rom the Wh ite House, the Navy, and the Air Force. The Air Force flatly declared that: 1. None o f the armed forces is conducting secret experiments with"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"disk-s haped flying objects that could be a ba sis for the reported p henomena. 2. There is no e vidence that the latter stem from t he activities of any foreign nation. Before this, President Truman stated he knew nothing of any such objects being developed by the United States or any other nation. The Navy denial came imm ediately after the first broadcast story. It ran: \"The Navy is not engaged in research or in flying any jet-powered, circular-shaped aircr aft.\" The Navy add ed that one model of a pancake-shaped aircr aft, called the Zimm erman Skimm er, w as built but was never flown. However, a small, three-thousand-pound scale model did fly and was un der r adio control during flight. This last device is now being rumoured as the Navy's unpiloted \"m issile,\" said to have been launched over the country like the so-called \"harmless\" disks . Even though all these accounts have been officially denied, many Americans may still believe they are true. I have no desire to criticize the authors of these stories; I believe that in following up certain guided-missile leads they were misled into accepting the conclusions they g ave. But these stories, particularly the accoun ts of huge unpiloted d isks , may have planted certain fears in the public mind-fears that are completely un warranted. For this reason, I have personally checked at Washington in regard to the dangers of un piloted missiles. Here aye the facts I learned: 1. Neither the Army, Navy, nor Air Force has at any time staged any guided-missile competition as rumoured. 2. No un piloted missiles or r emote-controlled experimental craft have been tested over American cities or heavily populated areas. 3. No un piloted missile carrying dangerous explosives, w hether for destruction of the device o r other p urposes, has been deliberately laun ched or tested over heavily populated areas. In regard to the so-called jet-propelled \"Flying F lapjack,\" I have been assured by Admiral Calvin Bolster, of the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics, that this type of plane has never been produced. I concede that he might make this statement t o conceal a secret development, but t here is one fact of which"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"every American can be certain: Neither this type, nor the radio-controlled smaller model, has been or will be flown or launched over areas where people would be e ndangered. The three armed services are working on guided missiles. They are not risking American lives by launching such missiles at random across the United States, Although most of our guided-missile projects are secret, it is possible to give certain facts ab out guided-missile developments in general. The first successf ul l ong-range missiles were produced by the Germans. These were the buzz-bomb a nd. the V-2 rocket. But research in various other types was carried on during the war. So me o f this was with oval and r ound types of airfoils. As already stated by P aul Redell, there is s trong evidence that the disk-s haped foil resulted from German observations of either space ships or r emote-control disk-s haped \"observer units.\" All the Nazi space-exploration plans followed this discovery that we were being observed by a race from another p lanet. After the e nd of World War II, the international guided-missile race began, with the British, Russians, and ourselves as the chief contenders. Numerous types have been developed-winged bombs, small radar-guided pr ojectiles laun ched from planes, and groun d-to-plane plane-to-groun d, and plane-to-plane missiles, equipp ed with target homing devices. In certain recent types, the range can be stated as several hun dred miles. So far as I have learned, after weeks of rechecking this point, not a single long-range missile has been identified as Russian. Since this country is working closely with Great Britain on global defence problems, it is no violation of s ecurity to say that we have probably exchanged c ertain guided-missile information. In regard to the British long-range missile picture o utlined to me by John Steele, I can state two major facts: 1. The British h ave categorically denied testing such long-range missiles over American territory, w here they might endanger American citizens. There is convincing evidence that they are telling the truth. 2. There is no British missile now built, or p lann ed, that could explain the objects s een by Captain Mantell, Chiles and Wh itted, and witnesses in most of the major sightings."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"The preceding statement app lies equally to American-built m issiles.

Certain recent advances should place us in the lead, un less confidential reports on So viet progress are completely wrong. If American scientists and engineers can learn the source o f the space ships' power and adapt it to o ur use, it m ay well be the means for ending the threat of war. The So viet scientists are well aware o f this; their r esearch into cosmic rays and other natural forces has been redoubled since the flying-saucer reports of 1947 .

The Air Force was puzz led, and ba dly worried when the disks f irst were sighted in 19 47. 2. The Air Force began to suspect t he truth soon after M antell's death — perhaps even before. 3. Project \"Saucer\" was s et up to investigate and at the same time conceal from t he public the truth ab out the saucers. 4. D uring the spring of 19 49 this policy, w hich h ad been strictly maintained by F orrestal, underwent an ab rupt change. O n top-level orders, it was decided to let t he facts gradually leak out, in order to prepare the American people. 5. This was the reason for the April 27 , 194 9, report, w ith its s uggestions ab out space visitors. 6. Wh ile I was preparing the article for the Ja nuary 1950 issue o f True, it had been considered in line with the general education program. But t he un expected p ublic r eaction was mistaken by the Air Force for hysteria, resulting in their hasty denial that the saucers existed. 7. Because the Air Force feared any closer analysis of the Mantell case, Major Boggs was instructed to publicize the Venus explanation. Although it had been denied, the Air Force knew that m ost people had forgotten this or had never known it. 8. Major Boggs, having stated this answer p ublicly (along with the o ther Chiles-Wh itted and Gorman answers), w as f orced to stick to it, though h e knew it was wrong and that the case summaries would p rove it. 9. The case summ aries were released to a small number of Washington newsmen, to continu e planting the space-travel thought; this decision being made after True's reception proved to the Air Force that the public was better prepared than h ad been thought. In regard to the flying saucers themselves, I believe that in the majority of"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"cases, space ships are the answer: 1. The e arth h as been under periodic observation from another p lanet, or other p lanets, for at least two centuries. 2. This observation sudd enly increased in 1947 , following, the series of A-bomb explosions begun in 194 5. 3. The o bservation, now intermittent, is part of a long-range survey and will continu e indefinitely. No immediate attempt to contact t he e arth seems evident. There may be some unknown block to making contact, but it is more probab le that the spacemen's plans are not complete. I believe that the Air Force is s till i nvestigating the saucer sightings, either through the Air Materiel Command or some o ther headquarters. It is possible that some Air Force o fficials s till fear a panic when the truth is officially revealed. In that case, w e may continu e for a long time to see routine denials alternating with n ew suggestions of interplanetary travel. The e ducation problem is complicated by two imperative needs. We must t ry to learn as much as we can ab out the space ships' source o f power, and at the same time try to prevent clues to this information from reaching an enemy on earth, If censorship is sudd enly imposed on all flying-saucer reports, this will be the chief reason. This would also help solve a minor pr oblem where partial censorship now exists. A few test m issiles laun ched from a southwest ba se have been seen by citizens at a distance from the proving g roun ds. In some cases, their r eports have got into local papers, though the wire services did not carry them. These missile tests are peculiarly different from t he general run of flying-saucer reports. Contrasted with the Chiles-Wh itted, Mantell, and other space-ship sightings, they stand out with a certain pattern, easy to recognize. News or r adio reports of these tests might accidentally give an enemy clues to the type, speed, and range o f this particular missile, once he learned the pattern. Periodic c ensorship, or even a complete blackout of s ighting reports, may be e nforced d uring the next year or so. For the purposes mentioned, such action would be justified. But whenever such censorship is lifted, the complete truth ab out space visitors s hould be told at the same time: the full details of all the major c ases, the size o f the Godman Field space ship, any attempted landings or other efforts at contact by interplanetary v isitors, and all other d etails that now are o fficial secrets."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"I also believe that a certain group of disk s ightings in this coun try is linked with our guided missiles. O fficial ann ouncements, of course, may be delayed a long time. With this exception, I believe that Americans s hould be told the truth, now. Wh en the ann oun cement of our guided missiles is made, some Americans not familiar with the facts may accept it as a full answer. If officials are not yet ready to reveal the space-travel facts, the Mantell evidence and other key cases may be deliberately g lossed over. But even if all the e vidence — the world-wide sightings, the o ld r ecords, the Chiles-Wh itted and other c ases — should be completely ignored, Americans cann ot escape e ventual contact with dwellers on other p lanets. Even though space visitors never attempt contact with u s, sooner or later earthlings will be traveling to distant planets — planets that scientists have said are almost surely inh abited. The American people have proved their ab ility to take incredible things. We have survived the stunning impact of the Atomic Age. We should be ab le to take the Interplanetary Age, w hen it comes, w ithout hysteria. ~"}]
