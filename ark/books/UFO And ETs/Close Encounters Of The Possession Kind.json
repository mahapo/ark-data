However, he goes beyond what has been described before by clearl y examining case histories that involved attachments, or take-overs, by aliens or extraterrestrials. Not only that, he demonstrates how some attachments by ETs have been manipulated by dark forces intervention. Besides showing the reader what has happened, he demonstrates the effectiveness of his releasement therapies in elimin ating any of, and all of, these types of attachments. His stunning case hist ories, showing him at work in resolving those debilitating conditions, gives the r eader not only information, but hope. The knowledge that one does not have to be burdened by these, at times life- threatening, intrusions. His book is also a manual for any mental health worker open-minded enough to put the client's we lfare above previously accepted belief systems or what is currently accepted as conventional therapy. He shows that these conditions do, indeed, happen, and, best of all, they can be resolved in a loving, human, and effective way. Dr. Baldwin's work is another of hi s contributions to the understanding and relief of human suffering . Bravo! Dr. Baldwin. Edith Fiore, Ph.D."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind PREFACE Sightings of unidentified flying object s, or UFOs, and involuntary abductions by aliens have been widely reported over the last five decades in countries around the world. Investigators have uncovered reports of similar visitations that occurred tens, hundreds, even thousands of years ago. 1 This is not a new happening. Through my clinical experience with thous ands of clients, I have come to accept not only the existence of discarnate entities and energies, and their effects on living people, but also the po ssibility that ETs (extraterrestrials) exist, at least in some form. Not in the way I read about in volumes of science fiction or books on UFOs and alien abductions, but in a fo rm I can communicate with, even though I can't see them. They have impact on our reality and they can affect individual human beings, usually with unfavorable results. Through the voices of the clients in altered states of consciousness, these alien beings reveal their purposes for be ing here, they describe their homeworld civilizations, and many express the desire to go \"home.\" In some cases, the ET commandant on a nearby spacecraf t, and even the leader of the ruling High Coun- cil on the homeworld, will speak through the voice of the client. The ETs offer many reasons for their presence here. Many are here to gather data and information on human life form s. They are technicians and scientists. There seems to be some kind of long-t erm genetic experimentation and manipula- tion in progress. Some ETs may be ab le to help troubl ed humans. A few apparently have the ability to heal physical ailments. So me people claim to have been spiritually transformed as the resu lt of an abduction and interaction with aliens. In other cases the ETs announce they are here to take control, to simply take over the human race, beginning with our client. They often threaten that we will be next. Such threats clearly indicat e DFE (dark force entity) influence. This channeled information could be to tally fabricated by the client, con- sciously or unconsciously. It may be a product of the collective unconscious mind, triggered by a subliminal mass hysteria ov er an urban myth of alien domination. A more sinister possibility refl ects the fears of the conspiracy theorists; the alien abductions may involve elements of our own government who have formed some kind of alliance with ETs, be ings from other worlds or other dimensions. Equally repugnant is the possibility that the entire UFO/ET enigma might be nothing less, nor more, than field testing of mind control technology by earth's own intelligence agencies or m ilitary personnel. However, it may be exactly what it a ppears to be: actual communication with an alien race. Whatever the case, the information voiced through the clients forms a consistent body of knowledge about the alien beings and their motivations for coming to our planet. Therapists deal with problems and situations which cause discomfort to 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"CEVI people. Most therapists deal with mundane, temporal conditions: emotional upset, personality imbalance, character deficien cy, relationship conflicts and similar issues. Psychiatrists often treat signs and symptoms of mental illness with medica- tion designed to control the symptoms. Few practitioners get involved in spiritual matters, though there is a reluctant bu t growing acceptance and recognition of religious or spiritual problems in the mental health field. 2 UFOs and ETs are considered by most he alth professionals as imagination and hallucination, the product of an unbalan ced or deranged mind, or outright hoax, and reports of such are not taken se riously. Possession and exorcism are still relegated to the domain of fantasy and hallucination, and not considered worthy of serious consideration. Even most clergy de ny and avoid this area. Several states have statutes expre ssly forbidding a licen sed mental health practitioner from being involved in any sort of exorcism procedure. And yet, perhaps millions of people suffer with the e ffects of non-physical or other-dimensional intelligent beings which interfere or connect with them in some way. Human and non-human entities are discovered in altered state sessions, causing many of the problems and conflicts which motivate people to seek profes- sional help. Many of these entities and energies attempt to take over mental and physical control of the host human. Some simply want a place to \"live,\" a body to call their own. Other types seek to disrupt or destroy the host. All of these errant beings want some thing for themselves, regardless of the desires, needs, plans, or spiritual path of the unfortunate host. This is a terrible violation of individual free will. Spirit guides, guardian angels, ascended masters, truly benevolent and highly e volved ETs, true spirit teachers and other light beings neither possess nor control humans and they do not impose their own agendas. This book describes the conflicts which se em to be produced by the intrusive, selfish, opportunistic, sometimes confused , often malevolent entities and energies that interfere with living people. Humans are sovereign beings, and have the right to live without such interference from aliens, entities, other human beings, or government agencies of any kind. Most of the case histories and dialogues in this book have been taken from actual sessions with people in our couns eling practice and training courses. The general information is pieced together from the clinical sessions of many clients. There is a consistency in the personal narratives, a pattern which can neither be denied nor ignored. The material is organized here in a coherent picture; the details have not been embellished in any way. My own conclusions, assumptions, and speculations are identified as such. The material in this book is not offere d as absolute truth. There is no way to prove the validity of the narratives which come through the client's voices in altered state sessions. Nor can these experi ences be interpreted in any meaningful way. The subjective experience of several thousands of people is presented here as part of the spectrum of the human condition. Real people have had these experi- ences; the memories are concealed in the deep unconscious mind. In an altered state of consciousness, also understood as hypnotic trance, they relate to us what 10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind has happened to them. This is what is being reported. Please read with an open mind. This is middle America speaking. This could be any of us. It IS some of us. Many colleagues in different parts of the country have reported similar ac- counts of the alien beings, ET intruders with similar \"missions.\" Several have contributed cases for this book. Names and id entifying details have been changed to ensure the anonymity of the people invol ved. Minor editing has been done in some descriptions and case transcripts for the sake of clarity only. The purpose of this book is to increase public awareness, not to arouse fear. In clinical practice, we find th at more than half our client s are apparently carrying the burden of attached ETs and suffering their in fluence. If this phenomenon is real, it must be investigated and researched thoroughly, documented and made public knowledge. And just consider the possibilities if it turns out to be true! We cannot ignore the mystery of the non-physical reality, the unconscious levels of mind, the imaginal realm, the spiritual levels of being. The deeper levels of consciousness have not been thoroughly explored. This is terra incognita, undiscovered territory, the unknown region. Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, in his autobiography, Memories, Dreams, Reflections, made this statement on the uncon- scious mind: 3 The years when I was purs uing my inner images we re the most important in my life — in them everything esse ntial was decided. It all began then; the later details are only supplements and clarifications of the material that burst forth from the unconscious , and at first swamped me. It was the prima materia for a lifetime's work. It is this uncharted territory which we explore and seek to understand with our limited human intellect. In these pages y ou will find some of the results of our research.  11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"CEVI ACKNOWLEDGMENTS My clients and the other intellig ences which speak through their voices continue to be my most pr ofound teachers.

Bob and Cathy Teets, my editors and publishers, also deserve my deep and sincere gratitude fo r their unending encouragement and support, their gentle course co rrection on my literary voyage, and their professional skills in this fi eld. Bob's cheerful voice on my phone always stirs renewed enthusiasm for the project when I find myself mired in ennui. \"Onward a nd upward,\" he cheers, and away we go!

The radio signals are sent into space, and the giant receiving dishes are waiting for return signals from some intelligent beings \"out there.\" SETI's work is based on at least two assumptions: 1. Aliens exist in three-dimens ional space-time as humans do. 2. They haven't yet arrived on earth. This could be faulty thinking! If we can draw any conclusions from human experience, then the aliens are already here. Millions of humans may ha ve had encounters with aliens on some kind of \"spaceship.\" 5 Many have described the trauma of being abducted against their will, taken aboard th e craft or to some unknown location, and subjected to intrusive and often painful physical procedures. 6 During some of these experiences the \"abductees\" claim to recognize humans in military uniforms. \"Space brothers\" have delivered volume s of information to Earth by channel- ing through sensitive persons. They have made several magnanimous promises: to stop nuclear wars; to lift our population o ff the planet until the predicted cataclys- mic earth changes are over; or to stop earth changes before they happen. (How could we know if they were successful?) They have exhorted humans to stop making war on each other and to love each other. (Good advice, whatever the source.) They have announced certain date s for their arrival in mass landings across the face of the planet. So far, they have not kept these appointments. In my youth, my closest encounter with space beings was through the pages of Astounding Science Fiction magazine. Such authors as Heinlein, Asimov, and Ray Bradbury were my literary ad venture heroes. I was still in high school when I read Donald Keyhoe's book, The Flying Saucers Are Real, published in 1950. With that book my thinking turned a corner, my mind opened to th e possibility of alien life forms existing somewhere else . Never again was the vast ness of space filled with the imaginary creatures of science fiction. According to Keyhoe, they were real and they were visiting Earth. Years of college, dental school, and a doctoral program in psychology gave me a firm scientific grounding. I think like a scientist. I am dedicated to rigorous scientific standards of inquiry and objec tive evidence when c onsidering and exam ining natural phenomena. The scientific method of inquiry works, at least for the narrow range of physically detectable phe nomena. Yet the scient ific method tends to be an impregnable, inescapable box which excludes all but \"hard\" physical evidence. Personal exploration of natural phenome na is also valid inquiry. However, subjective accounts are normally not accepted as part of the scientific method of research. Along with my years of edu cation, training, observation, and investiga- 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"CEVI tion, I also experienced guided imagery (images suggested by the facilitator), rebirthing (deep, rapid breathing exercise wh ich sometimes stimulates memories of the birth experience), past life regression therapy (uncovering memories of what seem to be prior lifetimes), spirit rele asement (removal of interfering conscious energies), and inner child healing (treat ment of wounded subpersonalities). I know from these personal experiences what th e client is feeling during a session. As a therapist I am sens itive to human feelings, me mories, and experience, no matter how far from consensus reality th e stories range, how they differ from accepted norms of the possible/impossible. I have seen and liste ned to human pain, and it is very real. I have learned that the exploration of human consciousness may uncover anything. Yet much of what is unco vered is rejected by objective science; it seems that a large part of human experi ence lies outside the parameters of the scientific method. Francis Bacon considered knowledge in itself to be a virtue, to be used to achieve power over nature, leading to long er, healthier, happie r human life. Galileo emphasized the value of observation over abst ract speculation. He left a legacy of ideas on astronomy that forever changed humankind's notions about the physical universe. Isaac Newton was born in 1642, the year Galileo died. In 1687, Newton published his Principia Mathematica, perhaps the greatest scientific work ever written. It dominated scientif ic thought for more than 200 years. Th e Newtonian- Cartesian paradigm is still the reigning model of scientific thinking, devoid of philosophic speculations. Science finally parted company with the spiritual reality betw een the middle of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, especially in Western civilization. Metaphysical and spiritual phenomena, being unprovable, were rel- egated to the province of religion. This was a great loss to the human race. Yet people continue to have mystical a nd spiritual experiences. Can this all be imagination or mass delusion? Deja vu, past life memories, out of body experience, near-death experience, possession by other beings or entities, channeling, psychic abilities, precognitive knowledge, UFO contact and abduction, and many other non-scientific events continue to be reported by intelligent, credible people. 7 A few scientists have been courageo us enough to study and document such phenomena, then publish their findings in these controversial areas. Some have been ridiculed by the mainstream scientif ic establishment, those people who won't acknowledge the existence of anything othe r than the physical universe. Yet aware- ness of the non-physical universe conti nues to expand, both in the general popula- tion and among some scientific types. Human experience cannot be denied nor explained away. Intelligent curiosity de mands serious investigation of the non- physical, or spiritual realm. The time is now. The scientific method will never be sufficient to properly and thoroughly explore the richness and depth of human co nsciousness. The research must include a sense of the spiritual. Subjective human experience cannot be weighed, measured, and exactly duplicated on demand. Yet human experiences are appropriate 14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind data for a complete science. William James, considered by many to be the father of American psychology, urged that science should be based only on experience, and that nothing within the totality of human e xperience should be excluded from being a potential topic of scientific investigation. In his Essays in Radical Empiri- cism, James defined this term: To be radical, an empiricism must neither admit into its construction any element that is not directly experienced, nor exclude from them any element that is directly experienced. 8 In 1981, a year and a half before I left my profession of dentistry, and after more than ten years of study in metaphysics, parapsychology, and the farther reaches of human consciousness including the near-death, after-death, and out-of- body experiences, past lives, spirit pos session and depossessi on, channeling, and other spiritual teachings, I began conducting a part-time private practice in past life regression therapy (PLT). 9 There were only a few books on the techniques of PLT at the time, written by practicing professionals. Around the world, thousands of therapists of various orientations are now using the techniques of this controversial a pproach to helping people. The client is guided into an altered state of consciousness, sometimes called hypnotic trance. The emotions surrounding a present-life situation can trigger memories of what seem to be events in other lifetimes. In theory, other lifetimes hold the source of most present life problems and conflicts. Memories of traumatic events from former lifetimes can be recalled, processe d in the therapy session, and the present life problems ease or disappear. When I first hear something unusual in a regression session, for instance a past life in Atlantis or on a distant planet, the details of an alien abduction or an implant device, or a particular type of atta ched entity and its effects on the client, I simply note it, without judgment. Many clients have described archetypal scenes such as conflict between the warrior gods of light and the beings of darkness who would take over earth. When similar descriptions emerge in two or three sessions, I am interested. If many clients report the same experiences, then I accept the experience as part of the human condition within the spiritual reality. To my surprise, after only a few months of doing past life regression sessions, I recognized signs and symptoms of what seem ed to be discarnate interference in a growing number of my clients. Like many people, I had assumed this condition to be imaginary, contrived, the result of para noia and delusional thinking. As a scien- tific investigator, I observed, recognized, studied this phenome non, and formed an hypothesis which was not unlike historical descriptions of the condition of spirit possession. 10 From the information gathered during c linical sessions, a ma p of the spiritual territory slowly unfolded whic h was similar to age-old desc riptions of the spiritual realms. 11 From this working model, I began to develop a rational methodology of treatment for the condition. Turns out the problem is neither imaginary nor delu- sional. Most people affected aren't aware of the interference until they discover it in a therapy session; the majority of my private clients uncover these unwelcome 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"CEVI intrusions. Many of the pe ople who believe and claim they are possessed usually aren't. All through history, this unwanted, involuntary condition has been labeled spirit possession or demon possession. In primitive cultures, spirits were thought to be everywhere, and everything was infused with unseen intelligence. This belief is termed animism. The typical religious literature depicts non-physical entities as demons, the minions of Lucifer, and all sp irit possession is considered to be demon possession. The adherents to the philosophy of Spiritualism, which began in the middle of the 19th century, believed such en tities to be the souls of departed loved ones, returned from the \"Sunnyl and\" of the after-death realm. 12 Rarely is a living human being taken over and controlled completely by a non- physical entity, though this condition has been reporte d. A person in this condition would not likely seek a therapy session for the problem. As I observed my clients in clinical se ssion carefully and rationally, it seemed clear that there was definite influence from these apparently separate entities. There are methods of differentiating betwee n parts of self, or subpersonalities, and separate beings of various kinds. I recognized the connection between human and entity as a parasitic condition, and I began using the term \"spirit attachment\" instead of spirit possession. My clients were my teachers along the wa y, as were these apparently attached entities of various kinds. In my curiosity I asked what must have seemed like endless questions of the entities. They answered through the client's voice. I learned a great deal about the mechanism of spirit attachment, the reasons for attraction and attachment, identification of the many different types of attached entities, and the mental, emotional, and phys ical effects on the host. It appeared that, aside from superstition, some of the ancient and classical literature on the subject was at least partially valid in a cl inical setting, and not merely philosophical and theological beliefs im posed on human thinking. Drawing upon this growing b ody of empirical knowledge, I developed rational techniques for appropriately releasing these intruders in a way that eliminated any possibility of their return. In ongoing ther apy, a person can lear n to strengthen the \"spiritual immune system\" 13 and begin to learn how to wa rd off future interference by such opportunistic entities. I briefly tried various ex orcism and deliverance techniques drawn from many volumes on the subject. The results were mixed. My own techniques developed empirically, by trial and error, with much correction; wh at worked, remained, what didn't was discarded. As a parallel to the descriptive term spirit attachment, I coined the designation Spirit Releasement Therapy (SRT) to describe the treat- ment methods I was evolving. I spent most of my waking hours during 1990 writing the book, Spirit Releasement Therapy: A Technique Manual, which outlines techniques of past life therapy, r ecovery of soul fr agmentation, and the methodology for clearing attached entities. In the clinical setting, the goal is to help a client find answer s within hi mself or herself that address and relieve person al conflicts or troubling conditions they 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind may be suffering. Over the y ears of exploring this pheno mena of discarnate inter- ference in clinical practice, the clients have helped me understand that regardless of the scientific rigidity of associated research, the bottom line to them is that the therapy works. In short, whether any, all, or none of what your are about to read is true in the strict scientific sense, it can be replicated in a clinical setting. Replication is one of the basic elements of the scientific method. There is a mass of accumulated fear and superstition surrounding the phe- nomenon of unseen spirits interfering with living humans, largely promulgated through the centuries by the Church. In lectures, seminars, workshops, trainings, books and articles, it has been my goal to ease the fear, erase the superstition, to describe rationally a real phenomenon, and in crease the public awar eness of this very common condition. As my experience expanded in the clin ical work and I developed the method- ologies of SRT, my knowled ge of the spiritual reality also expanded. The tech- niques are effective in practice and I began to train others in the work. To date, more than 500 people have completed the Basic SRT Training, and thousands of others have read my Technique Manual or studied with someone else. Many of these people conduct spirit releasem ent sessions with similar results. In 1989, I met and married Judith. She is a talented painter, brilliantly cre- ative, and a deeply spiritual human being. Sh e is an excellent instructor and a gifted spiritual counselor. We present professi onal trainings together and work as co- therapists in clinical sessions. Her presence is a great gift to me personally and professionally. Over the years of clinical experience I discovered what appeared to be three main types of intrusive, attaching entities: the so-called earthbound spirits (EB) of deceased humans which are bound or stuck in the earth pl ane and unable or unwill- ing to move on to the higher realms; th e dark force entities (DFE), which includes the classic demon; and aliens or extrate rrestrials (ET). This book focuses primarily on the ET and DFE, though there are many other interfering energies. These various intruders seemed to cause all manner of mental, emotional, physical, and relationship problems for people. The earthbound human spirits, the EBs, impose human conditions and ailments on the unsuspecting host such as habits, behaviors, addictions, inappropriate emotions, sexual distortions, and the physical symptoms of illness. The DFEs attempt to block every aspect of human progress, to undermine love in any form or situation, such as self esteem, personal relationships, and family groups, and to generally cause chaos and disruption at every opportunity. They often claim they ar e just \"doing their job.\" The ETs state that they are from \"far away,\" and the Light in their \"universe\" is a color other than golden-white. 14 They do not impose human problem s, and they are often here on a specific \"scientific mission\"—except fo r those who are influenced by the DFEs. Whatever the truth might be regarding alien civiliza tions, humans have always had a curiosity about what's \"out ther e.\" Many have voiced the thought that we humans might have come from \"out ther e.\" The notion of \"sky people\" has pep- 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"CEVI pered human thinking, as evident in some early cave drawings and petroglyphs, sacred scriptures, fictional accounts of space travel, and sci-fi movies. 15 Science fiction still holds fascination for many millions of people. Star Trek: The Next Generation was the most successful weekly sh ow in the history of syndicated television. 16 Possession was a common theme in the various Star Trek series. Survival of consciousness beyond physi cal death and spirit possession have been the subject of numerous popular movies such as Ghost, All Of Me, Maxie, and of course, The Exorcist. Possession or control by another being goes against our most basic human and spiritual rights. It is a possibility both terrifying and preposterous. We rail against excessive political or police power. We have laws against intruders who violate our physical person or property. Me dical science has developed remedies for many of the microorganisms which inva de our bodies and cause disease. We must expand our awareness of the non-phys ical intruders of all kinds. There are effective methods of dealing with the unsee n forces which impose upon us. In this book, you will read abou t real cases of these close en counters with conscious alien beings: the causes, the effects, and the treatment. There is a reference to such in the Bible (Ephesians 6:12): ... we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. 18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind C h a p t e r 1 POSSESSION AND THE EXTRATERRESTRIALS AMONG US SPIRIT POSSESSION The possibility of spirit possession, that is , full or partial takeover of a living human by a discarnate or non -physical being, has been recognized, or at least theorized, in every time and in nearly every culture. It seems that a disembodied consciousness, a spirit, a soul, an entity, can join or attach itself and merge fully or partially with the subc onscious mind of a living person, exerting some degree of control on the mental functions, emotions, and beha vior. An attached entity can produce sensations and symptoms in the physical body of the unsuspecting host. People around the wo rld have described these po ssessing enti ties as gods, demons, deities, ancest ors, spirit guides, healing spirits of some sort, great teachers, and, more re cently, as travelers and teache rs from other star systems such as the Pleiades, Arcturus, Orion, A ndromeda, Lyra, Vega, or Sirius. Spirit possession is an ancient yet enduring concept, largely denied and ignored by the clergy and mental health professionals in our materialistic Western society. In recent years, however, a growing number of open-minded therapists have begun to notice the condition a nd accept the possibi lity of non-physic al consciousness and its effects on living people. 17 In clinical psychotherapy sessions, clients describe conflicts, problems, and areas of discomfort in their lives. As they describe painful and unpleasant situa- tions, emotions usually emerge such as anger an d frustration, guilt and remorse, even sadness and tears. They usually begin to feel thes e emotions as sensations in the physical body: nausea, a flush of heat or col d, tightness or tension in muscles, or headache. The descriptions of the problem ar e often metaphorical phrases, such as: \"This makes me sick,\" or \"He's such a pain in the neck,\" or \"It feels like I'm being stabbed in the back,\" or \"It feels like I have a tight band around my head.\" The client is guided to locate the so urce of these feeli ngs, both emotional feelings and body sensations, and to recall the first time they felt this way. They are urged to repeat the phra ses. They are directed to focus inward and describe what they see, feel, hear. 18 These suggestions usually lead the person into the heart of the problem, the source of the pr esent life conflict, usually a traumatic event, often in a past life sett ing. If it is a past life of the client, then past life therapy will help ease the problem. Howeve r, it may be an at tached entity which is causing the problem. There are method s of differentiating between a client's earlier traumatic recall and the memories of an attached entity . There are specific techniques for releasing the different types of attached entities. 19 Earthbound spirits, or EB s, the surviving conscious ness of deceased humans, 19"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"CEVI are the most commonly discovered posse ssing, obsessing, or attaching entities. The emotions and feelings connected with a sudden, traumatic death can hold a spirit to the earth level, usually in the environment in which the person lived and died. Anger, fear, jealousy, resentment, guilt, remorse, even strong ties of love can interfere with the normal transition into the Light. The grief of the survivors can hold their loved ones earthbound after the death of the physical body. The newly deceased spirits can follow and so metimes cling to living humans. In session the client often discovers a di fferent type of non-physical influence: a dark, arrogant, hostile, malevolent, disrup tive, destructive entity which claims to be a follower of Lucifer, The Dark One, The Evil One, The Great One, or some other similar name. It claims it has neve r been alive in its own human body. This description conforms to the classic portray al of demons in the literature of Chris- tianity and other religions. These we have termed dark force entities, or DFEs. Another form of non-physical entity we of ten discover with our clients is the alien, the extraterrestrial, or ET, a consci ous, sentient being. Typically, they have never been human, though a few claim former incarnations in a human body on earth. This is not the spirit of a deceased alien; their normal form seems to be non- physical. 20 They are neither hostile nor belligere nt, disruptive nor destructive as the DFEs are. A few assert they are lost or marooned here. Many claim that they come to gather information. Others conduct experiments on humans by influencing emotions in some way and monitoring the re sults. Some claim to be here to assist human earth citizens in their spiritual evolution, perhaps even to help our people through the long-predicted catastrophic earth changes. Some of them are further advanced t echnologically than humans, some more enlightened in their spiritual evolution. However, most of these aliens who dia- logue through the voices of clients are not spiritually aware in the least. As time/ space/dimension travelers, they are operating in their own self interest, without regard for the inhabitants of whatever pl anet they are exploring and exploiting, and this can wreak havoc with the citizens of earth. A very few of these intruders claim that they infiltrate living humans in order to gather scientific data or other information and they ha ve no intention of interfer- ing. They apologize and withdraw when we explain the situation. Other ET \"scien- tists\" refuse to leave, refuse to talk w ith us, and consider humans to be nothing more than lab rats to be used in their experiments. This indicates DFE control of the ET, and reveals the more sinister purpose for their presence. Still others arrogantly proclaim they are here to conquer humanity and take over the planet for their own use and there is nothing anyone can do about it. This element of power and control over others signals the influence of the DFEs. In these cases, the ETs themselves are controlled, even possessed, by the demonic beings. There is no real time table for su ch takeover, and some of these aliens assert they have been with their human host for numerous lifetimes. Some of the UFOs and alien beings can be perceived in the physical form, yet can shift vibration and become non-physical, apparently at will, hence invisible to human eyes as well as radar. They can a ffect humans in a dreadful variety of ways. 20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind Carla and Her ET Brother Carla was sobbing. She could barely speak through her tears. She was deeply moved as she witnessed the release of an earthbound spirit from an older man in the group who had volunteered to be the subject of the demonstration. In this case, the entity was the spirit of a deceased child who had been with the man since his early married years. It had wanted to be born to this couple. There were very few dry eyes in the place as the little spirit sa id farewell to its w ould-have-been parents and moved into the Light. Carla was crying so hard she could not see to walk out of the building and drive home. This is not an unusual reacti on after observing an emotionally intense spirit releasement session. I offered to help her explore the source of the tears and grief she was feeling. I susp ected an attached entity. He r tears finally subsided and an entity was able to speak through Carla' s voice. It claimed to be her brother in another existence on another planet in a di fferent solar system. He followed her to this system when she chose to come to the planet Earth to incarnate. He did not want to endure the whole process of b ecoming a human in his own body as she had done. He had bypassed that ste p. Now he wanted her to w ithdraw so he could live through her body, or at least move aside so he could take over. With very little explanation he realized the harm he was doing to his sister, whom he loved yet wanted to dominate in this chauvinistic manner. As he re- counted their life on their home planet in a distant space and time, Carla also recalled the love they had shared there and began to weep again, this time for the joy of that memory and the sadness over the loss. This was, in effect , a dual past life regression, both beings remembering the same prior existence on another planet. He agreed to go and she agreed to release him, though the attraction of love was strong between them. More than a year later, she was thrilled to report major changes in her life as the result of the release of her ET brother. Janet and the Alien Probe Janet was an intuitive healer, adept in her work and in her life. In session she discovered a probe in her third chakra, the solar plexus. She described a thin black cord which, in her perception, led upward through two dimensions. It was con- nected to a laboratory on a spacecraft. As Janet visualized the location, I called out to the one in charge of the lab. Janet described a sort of humanoid form which actually responded to my questions. She was able to repeat its words. This remote communication link, this type of channelin g, has produced some fascinating results over the years. Yes, this alien scientist acknowledged, there was a pr obe inserted at the level of her solar plexus. It was for the purpose of gathering information on the mem- bers of the human species. Dr. Baldwin: \"How many such members of the human race have you treated this way?\" Janet: \"About 3,000.\" 21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"CEVI Dr. B.: \"This is a violation of an inte lligent species. You have no right to interfere in this way.\" J.: \"We did not know we were interfering.\" Drawing from the realms of science fiction, I tried to imagine the organization of such a group of beings. I took a chance and plunged ahead. Dr. B.: \"Cross connect us with your h eadquarters. We want to speak with your High Command.\" A few moments passed and Janet straight ened in the recliner. Her voice took on a different tone; the ma nner was almost imperious. High Command through Janet: \"Yes, what is it you want?\" Dr. B.: \"Your scientists have placed probes in 3,000 human beings without consent.\" H.C.: \"Yes. They are gathering data.\" Dr. B.: \"You are gathering data from unwilling subjects. Aren't you aware of the concept of non-interference? There is to be no interference with another sentient species.\" H.C.: \"Yes, we are aware. We did not m ean to interfere, only to gather data.\" Dr. B.: \"We are a sentient species. We protest this intrusion.\" H.C.: \"What would you like us to do?\" Dr. B.: \"We request that you withdraw your probes from every human being on this planet.\" This was a request, not a demand. I ha d nothing to enforc e such a demand. There was some hesitation, as if there was a discussion being carried on in the background. My skeptical mind asks: \"If any of this is true, why do they talk to me and why would they be w illing to do what I ask? \" These questions ar e always with me in altered state sessions. My skepticism remains alive and well. H.C.: \"We will withdraw th e probes. We have gather ed enough information.\" Dr. B.: \"Thank you.\" H.C.: \"You are welcome. Good-bye.\" Dr. B.: \"Good-bye.\" The commander was already gone. The alien scientist apologized and gathered his equipment, including the probe, and completed whatever tasks remained. Soon, he was also gone. Janet came out of the altered state as bewildered as I. Were these images valid? Was this nothing more than imag ination? Are humans perceived by more highly developed beings as nothing more than biological units, subjects to be randomly probed, examined, and tested, much like lab animals used by earth scientists? Am I implanting these notions ? I don't think so; this was my first encounter with such a situation, and I had no such notions. Many hundreds of clients have since e xperienced and described such intrusion with probes, implants, and devices for testing, monitoring, and controlling. As a therapist, I must work with whatever in formation emerges from the client as if it were real. At some level of consciousness, it is real for the client. 22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind What's really going on here? Did we come from the stars? Are we about to go back there again? Can we really talk with aliens through the ch anneling abilities of people in an altered state of consciousness? Why do they listen? Why do they bother to do what we, as therapists, reque st? But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's back up and begin at the beginning: the experience of birth. 23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"CEVI C h a p t e r 2 REGRESSION THERAPY Regression therapy has enjoyed renewed in terest in the past few decades. The notion that the adult can be affected by childhood events, often traumatic, is not new. Sigmund Freud fostered the theory that repressed memories stimulate and influence adult behavior. Freud claimed that memories of events earlier than age five or six, and certainly infancy, could not be retrieved and expressed adequately because of the limited verbal ability of the child and the infant. 21 However, guided by a well-trained therapis t, a person in an altered state of consciousness can uncover and recall repre ssed and forgotten events from child- hood, infancy, birth, the time spent in utero, the experience prior to conception, even other lifetimes. Much of the uncove red material can be verified as valid memories of actual events. 22 But not all. Some of thes e remembered events may be part of an attached entity's experience. Memory can be less than accurate, and several past events can begin to merge into one memory. Movie scenes, stories, su ggestions by friends or therapists, even dreams can become part of the stream of memory. This is termed confabulation of memory. For this reason, events recalled under hypnosis cannot be assumed to be completely real and part of the client's life. In therapy, we strive to ease the emo- tional impact of recalled events, from this life or another time. We work as if it were true. For the client, it is true at some level. The emotional impact is all too real, and can continue to a ffect a person, long after the actual event, whatever it might have been. Birth Regression It seems that many people are fixate d or stuck in the birth trauma. 23 Human behavior tends to reenact the birth experience. Many people cannot stand to have anything tight around their ne ck, whether it's a necktie, turtleneck sweater, or whatever. Most people are very shallow breathers. The urge to breathe and to resist anything that interferes is a most powerful drive for the human; the need for air is the primary hunger. Think about your breathing. How are you br eathing right now? With shallow little breaths or a deep, belly-stretching inta ke of air? Most pe ople find themselves taking very shallow breaths, as if afraid to breathe, or worse, prevented from breathing. During a therapy session, this can often be traced to memories of the actual birth experience. The details of the birth an d the entire nine months of the pre-natal period and before are availa ble within the subconscious mind, and this includes the moment of conception. These memories can be uncovered and described through the words of the adult client. 24 There is no barrie r to the memory of these events. 25 As the infant passes through the birth canal, the umbilical cord is squeezed, 24"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind shutting off the supply of nutrients, in cluding oxygen. Once the baby is born, the mouth is cleared of fluids an d the lungs can begin to expand and fill with air. If the umbilical cord is cut before this process is complete, there is a period of time when no oxygen is comi ng in. To the newborn th is feels like suffocation. 26 The client is guided to trace this feel ing back to its source. Often a prior lifetime is discovered when death was caused by suffocation, hanging, or strangu- lation. Past life therapy on the death expe rience will ease the discomfort with tight things around the neck. Exploring the birth experience in this way will often ease the problem of shallow breathing. It is a basic principle of Freudian psychodynamic theory that \"reliving is relieving.\" Bri nging the subconscious memories into the conscious level may ease or resolve the problem or conflict, though many issues require further processing for complete resolution. This is the essence of regression therapy. Jeff Relationship patterns can be established during the birth experience. Jeff described his love life as a series of very brief affairs, usually with large-breasted blond women. In session, he discovered th at he had been taken from mother immediately after birth, which interrupted the essential mother -infant bonding. He was wrapped in a blanket and held and regularly cared for by a large, buxom, loving, blond-haired nurse. She sm elled good, she felt good, she gave him nurturance and nourishment. His mother was distant and unable to care for him because she was recovering from the ordeal of giving birth to her son. From that moment forward he was unconsciou sly looking for the big, blond nurse. Recovery of Lost Soul Fragments Recovery of Soul Fragmentation (RSF) is a clinical approach to soul retrieval, a traditional shamanic method of healing. In indigenous cultures, sickness was thought to be caused by loss of one's soul, or part of it. The shaman journeyed into the underworld, the upper world, or wherev er the soul fragment had gone, to retrieve the soul and return it to the sick person, restoring wholeness and health. 27 This is more than a primitive notion. In clinical practice, we find that the condition of dissociation or fragmentation of consciousness is very common with people. Depending on the seve rity of the trauma which le ads to the dissociation, the results can range from mood changes to the often debil itating condition of multiple personality disorder (MPD), now called dissociative identity disorder (DID). 28 DID is often the result of childhood sexual abuse. This condition is reflected in our langu age, indicating an inner awareness of the condition: \"It was a shattering experience.\" \"That guy isn't playing with a full deck.\" \"Hello, is anyone home in there?\" \"I'm just falling apart.\" \"I feel half dead.\" \"I left my heart in San Francisco.\" 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"CEVI The term Recovery of Soul Fragmentati on is used to describe the clinical method of gathering the scattered soul or mind fragments. The healing of the condition is also familiar to the inner mind, the inner kn ower. It is expressed in such expressions as the following: \"Pull yourself together.\" \"He's a real together guy.\" \"I'm getting it together.\" Most everyone has mixed feelings at ti mes, mood changes, awareness of parts of the personality with diff erent desires, roles, even functions. We often act differ- ently in different circumstan ces: the overbearing supervisor in the office can be a submissive husband at home ; the capable, conscientious, patient and loving mother can be a screaming, demanding, unreasonable customer at a department store sale. These various selves 29 have been labele d subpersonalities. 30 Many people shift between the many subpersonalities without notice, simply adjusting and conform- ing to the surrounding circumstances. 31 More obvious changes in personality can stem from some early painful experience. These splits of consciousness can result fr om a major or minor, real or imag- ined, emotional or physical trauma. Most of these personality fragments remain with the person, affecting behavior, appetites, and attitudes. There are many therapeutic techniques for treating this condition: ego state therapy, inner child healing, subpersonality therapy, parts therapy. In clinical practice, we have found that some of these splits or fragments actually separate from the person much like the out-of-body experience (OOBE). 32 Each fragment remains connected to the core consciousness in the physical body by a silver thread, a part of the si lver cord connect ing soul to body. 33 Many clients in altered states can perceive this silver thread connection. In some reported cases of out-of-body experience, people can perceive a \"cord of light\" connecting their physical body with the loca tion of their consciousness. 34 A fragment can be separate d from a person and just follow like a balloon on a string. A mind fragment of a living person can be with another living person as an attached entity. A fragment can remain in a location of a trauma or an especially joyous event. The fragment can sometimes be found in some di stant location. If a fragmentation occurred in a prior lifetime, the fragment might still be back there/ then. Nearly all these fragments can be located and recovered in a therapy session. In the literature on multiple personality, the sufferers, more often women than men, describe splitting away psychicall y, actually leaving the body during sexual abuse. Combat veterans often sustain se vere fragmentation during life-threatening firelights. A serious traffic accident, ev en a narrowly missed collision, can cause a fragment to separate and move toward the Light, assu ming it has died. The shock, the emotional impact of the trauma on th e psyche, can lead to a fragmentation of the consciousness, the soul essence. Emotional violation can cause fragmentation as quickly as physical pain. A child who trusts a parent or grandparent can be emotionally shattered if that loved 26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind one sexually violates the child. The ability to trust will leave with the fragment. A child or young adolescent can be devastated if a parent dies. Th ere is a lack of understanding and often a feeling of self-blame for the death. The ability to love may be crushed and the fragm ent will harbor that crippl ed capacity. The person no longer has the ability to love. When we discover fragmentation, the client is guided to locate the original trauma and recover the lost fr agment. We assist in processing the emotional pain to a peaceful resolution, and the soul fragment, or subpersonality, is welcomed back into the body/mind space, like a piece of a jigsaw puzzle fitting into place. As the fragment is recovered and healed of its emotional pain, it will bring back that ability to trust or ability to love, or some other emotion or capacity which was lost along with the fragment, su ch as creative imagination or playful- ness. In this way, the returning fragment always has a \"gift\" for the client, often an essential emotional ability or transpersonal quality such as loya lty, honesty, even clairvoyance or other psychic ability. With th e fragment safely home, the client will report a feeling of warmth, peace, and a pleasant new sense of wholeness. Fragmentation presents a wide-open door for any passing entity. If there are literally pieces missing from the soul essence of an indi vidual, an entity can easily enter and attach. In session, we often disc over that this is the vulnerability which first allowed the attachment. Soul fragme nts are recovered and integrated after releasement of attached entities. This is part of the protection against future intrusion. William James wrote and lectured on multiple pers onality and spirit possession. These were professionally acceptable subjects for investigation early in this century. In James' day, there was \".. .much al armist writing in psychopathy about degeneration,\" and he suggested that\".. .if there are devils, if there are supernormal powers, it is through the cracked and fragmented self that they enter.\" 35 We discover some degree of fragmentati on in nearly every client we see in our private counseling practice. Who among us has not suffered at least some minor trauma in life? Fragmentation as the source of illness is an important concept in the native healing traditions. It may prove to be an important thread in the rich tapestry of holistic healing. The Chocolate Chip Cookie Eater One of my own subpersonalities was a \"c hocolate chip cookie eater.\" When I was about 9 years old, my aunt made me some chocolate chip cookies. The warm, wonderfully fragrant cookies were heaped on a plate sitting on the pull-out bread- board. They smelled great. I reached for a cookie. She slapped my hand! That was a shock! I didn't understand. Again I reached for a cookie. She slapped my hand again! AHA! I got it! No cookies! She had some cockamamie idea that the cookies had to cool before they could be eaten. But my mouth was wateri ng and I wanted one of MY cookies NOW. No way. So I salivated and longed for a cookie while they cooled. That silly little upset, a minor emotional trauma, caused a personality split-off that affected my cookie 27"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"CEVI eating habits for years to come. Eventu ally I worked on it in a therapy session. The source of the trauma seemed to be a past life in which I had died of starvation at age 9. The episode with the c ookies restimulated that greater trauma. The way I attempted to deal with the buried fear of deat h was to buy freshly baked chocolate chip cookies, a dozen or two at a time, in this life. A very minor trauma, but it exemplifies the condition and the effects of a subpersonality. After that session, my consumption of chocolate chip cookies assumed \"normal\" proportions. Past Life Therapy Many people reject the idea of looking into a past lifetime for problems as they claim to have enough troubles in th e present life. This sounds reasonable. However, in clinical practice, clients di scover that present life conflicts and prob- lems often stem from trauma tic events in prior lifetime s. Past life memories may come to us in many guises: the deja vu experience; recurrent dreams, either of a specific location, or of a frightening ev ent; an unexplained, groundless fear, or a crippling phobia. People who fear water, pu blic speaking, or heights (to name just a few common phobias) often uncover the memo ry of a death by drowning, hanging or burning at the stake before a crowd, or falling from a high place. As these past life traumas are explored and resolved in therapy sessions, the phobias cease to exist for the clients. The process of past life therapy (PLT) is being used effectively by mental health professionals in many countries. 36 Through the emotional feelings and body sensations associated with an identified present life problem, the client is prompted to locate the source or caus e or origin of the problem. This usually leads to the discovery of a pain-filled memory in a past lifetime existence. The client, in the personality of the past-life character, is guided to resolution of the traumatic episode in the lifetime, and fina lly through the moment of death. From this point, the newly deceased soul can review the life, easily recall the source of anger, fear, resentment, and a ny other unresolved conflicts in the life- time. This after-death experience can be a ri ch font of healing for the client. The therapist assists the client in resolving any remaining emotional issues, any unfin- ished business in that life, finally to the point of being willing to forgive the indi- viduals involved in the past life incidents, including one's own self. Self forgiveness may be the most difficult to accept. With this resolution and healing of past hurts, the client can leave behind the trauma of that lifetime and integrate the lessons of the healed experience into the present life situation. Once the past life character is separated from the physical b ody and free from any physical constraint or emotional ties with the lifetime, it can move away from the body and the death scene an d make the transition fully into the Light. This part of the narrative is similar to descriptio ns of the near-death experience (NDE), 37 during which the being returns from the threshold of the Light and rejoins the physical body. The past-life personality, in fact all th e past life and potential future life personalities, are contained within the soul essence, along with the memories and 28"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind lifescripts of all lifetimes. The entire panorama of past lives, and future lives, on this planet and elsewhere, is available to the client in an altered state of conscious- ness. The linear flow of time is an artifact of the physical universe, which a being experiences only while incarnated in physical form. Past and future lives do not seem to be arranged in this linear fashion. 38 Many emotional problems and conflicts are quickly and effectively resolved through PLT, usually in far fewer sessi ons than with conventional therapy. Many physical ailments are considered to be psychosomatic, and these conditions may begin to diminish or cease altogether. W ith the knowledge an d wisdom gained through past life regression therapy and th e power of forgiveness, the unfinished business, the unresolved issues, the emotional residue of past times can be healed. Then a person can live, and love, more fully in the present moment. There is enormous healing potentia l in past life therapy. Past life therapy, when performed by a we ll-trained professional therapist, is a powerful, safe, swift, direct approach to psychotherapy, and the results are often immediate and lasting. The amazing success of past life therapy does not depend on the belief or disbelief of either the therapist or the client. Reincarnation as an age- old philosophical concept and theoretical re ality is a spiritual teaching; past life therapy is a well-established psychotherapeutic technique that works. Pete and Marian Pete was a 35-year-old TV producer. He suffered from diabetes which re- quired a daily intake of 12 units of insulin by injection. This is not a high dosage but it is significant. Pete had lost the visi on in one eye, and was suffering impaired circulation in his legs which could eventu ally lead to amputation. Pete's body was literally giving out bene ath him. He was awas h in helpless anger. The TV show was an interview format, an d I had been invited to discuss past life regression therapy. Marian, the hostess, had reluctantly volunteered to undergo an altered state session in preparation fo r the show. About the only way an inter- viewer can formulate intellig ent questions on a little-kno wn subject like past life therapy is to actually experience a session. Marian chose to explore a disturbing dream which had been recurring two or three times a week as far b ack as she could remember. In the dream, she sensed herself looking down on a small, old-fash ioned town. She floated along a brick road to the edge of town and that was it, the dream would end. Several times a week, week after week, she w ould awaken with a feeling of sadness. Not the best way to face life each day! I asked Marian to recall and describe the dream. She related the short seg- ment and I urged her to continue and de scribe what she experienced next. Sur- prised that her \"dream\" continued, she saw that the brick road extended down to the edge of a small rive r. The scene ended there. At my suggestion, she started to narrate the dream again. This time, I made a clinical assumption that the \"dream\" was a repressed, emotionally laden memory, perhaps from a past lifetime. At the e nd of her narrative, I directed Marian to 29"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"CEVI locate a time when she was in her body in the town. She immedi ately recalled an event and began to describe it. The assu mption seemed to be valid. Her response could also be the result of my directi on. What followed, however, was not the result of any suggestion. She was engaged to be married. She was standing before the smoking ruins of the home of her fiance and his parents, feeling desperate and confused. They had all died in the fire. The constable of the small town assumed she was guilty of setting the fire and attempted to take her into custody. She escaped and ran into the woods surrounding the area, where sh e remained, undetected, for several hours. She heard noises in the brush nearby. Three \"highwaymen,\" as she called them, discovered her, raped her, and slit her throat. She floated above the treetops, separated now from her body and pain-free, yet deeply sadden ed by the death of her fiance and very confused. In spirit, time is no barrier to explor ation. She could move back and forth and observe, much like fast forwarding or reversing a video tape. She explored the circumstances of the fire and discovered th at her fiance had set the blaze, planning for his parents to die, counting on their m eager wealth as his inheritance. To his horror, he had been trapped in the hous e, and had died along with them. She was terribly disappointed by his behavior and by her own poor judgm ent of his charac- ter. Her naive infatuation for him quickly vanished. She drifted across her little town, ove r the brick road, across the flowing river, and began to rise toward an approaching Light. This new understanding relieved her confusion and eased her sadness . Marian came out of the altered state feeling somehow unburdened. She had to rush to fix her makeup to be ready for air time. Pete wanted to explore his diabetes through regression therapy. It was now 11:00 AM and the show was scheduled to begin at noon. I agreed to do the ses- sion, even though it would have to be brief. He went right into the experience. Dr. B.: \"How do you feel about what's happening to your body?\" He began to feel the anger. His eyes cl osed as he gave vent to his emotions and described his physical sensations. Dr. B.: \"Good, let those feelings take you back to another time when you felt the same way. Locate the source of the feelings of anger. Recall the origin of those sensations in your body. Let those feelings take you right back.\" He found himself as an I ndian hunting with a bow a nd arrow; he was stalking a bear. He shot the bear. It was not a fa tal shot. The bear turned, chased him, knocked him down, clawed at him, tore his body open, ripping apart the intestines and internal organs, including the pancreas, the organ which malfunctions in the condition of diabetes. As the non-physical body, the etheric bod y, rose out of th e physical body, I said, \"Look at your form now. How does it appear?\" Pete: \"It's all ripped open, it's all to rn, it's wide open, it's ripped, it's torn.\" 30"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind He was already rising towa rd the approaching Light. We only had about 15 minutes left before air time. I directed Pete to fill the torn spaces in the etheric body with light. I suggested that he begin to imagine light coming in from the brightness above him, to just funnel light in to every space in his etheric form. This was a good mo ment to use guided imagery. The etheric body seems to carry the patterns for the future physical body, including the seeds of illness. If it is fu lly healed at that point, there will be no possibility of that illness in a future incarnation. If it is healed in the past, the physical condition in the present life may improve, th e symptoms of illness may ise. Dr. B.: \"Can you see the light coming in?\" P.: \"Yes, it's pouring in.\" Dr. B.: \"How does it feel?\" P.: \"It's wonderful, it's warm.\" Dr. B.: \"Is it full yet?\" P.: \"No.\" Dr. B.: \"Keep pouring it in.\" Which he did for a good ten minutes. I checked my watch at least twice a minute. We were very close to air time. P.: \"It's full.\" He said this in a very peaceful voice. Dr. B.: \"How does that feel?\" P.: \"Wonderful!\" was his heartfelt reply. The spirit of this Indian ro se into the Light in that peaceful, healed state. The regression was complete. We had five minut es to spare and Pete rushed to makeup. An assistant patted my forehead with a powder puff and I was escorted into the studio. When the show began, Marian offered a few word s about hypnotherapy and regression therapy. She shared what she had just experienced. Still a little groggy, she was not her usual \"cool\" self when th e show began and the audience loved it. Pete did not usually appear on the show. This day, however, he wanted to share his regression experience also. Pete was profoundly aware that something had changed within his body. With awe in his voice he said, \"I'm going to have to get something to eat. My body is starting to produce insulin.\" Three months later I was again invited to appear on the show. A member of the audience asked about regression therapy and dreams. Marian related her regression experience. She had not had th e dream since her session. It was simply gone! Pete reported that he only required one fourth of the amount of insulin he had used prior to his brief session. A year later, he was down to one tenth of his former dosage. His physician had no explanation, ye t he did not negate the results. He did acknowledge that the mind is very powerf ul, and that these things sometimes happen. Pete was delighted. Sparks of Consciousness Past life therapy is based on the philo sophy that the human spirit is, in its 31 "},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" CEVI essence, an individual being, an indivisi ble spark of consciousness, with the com- plete memory of its experience since extending from Source, God, Goddess, the All That Is. This spark emanated, alo ng with countless other individual beings, from an ineffable Creator Source, the bright est Light in the Universe of Universes. Each particle, or spark of the original To tality, is termed a \"monad.\" Like the parts of a hologram, each fragment of the whole contains a complete replica of the Totality when it was in its perfect state. Every monad is endowed with the urge to return to this perfect state, which keeps it in perpetual motion toward eventual reunion with God. 39 There may be billions of star systems and billions of planets in the universe where these individual sparks of conscious ness can exist in some form of \"life.\" Some of them seem to move from one plan et to another. A small segment of these conscious beings chose the planet Earth as their destination. There seems to be a portal or entryway into the earth cycle of existence. After coming through this portal, there are great Halls of Learning where the spirit being prepares for earth life before moving into the Planning Stage. In the Planning Stage just before entering the physical life cycle and connecting with the physical body, a form of spiritual contract is established which involves choosing the circumstances for the coming life. 40 This includes details such as: gender, geographical location, parents and family situation including material wealth, general health of the planned physical body, love partners, spouses, chil- dren, and opportunities for spiritual growth, learning forgiveness, goals and life purpose, and balancing past \"karmic debts.\" 41 There are several guides or spiritual counselors who assist in planning the Lifescript. Individual beings repeatedly take physi cal form in a series of lifetimes, or incarnations, each time in their own human body. This is part of the plan, the contract, the Lifescript; one soul, one body. No other being has the right to inhabit the contracted body. When th e body falls away in death, th e spirit being returns to a specific level of the Light, or spirit space, a place of very high consciousness. This place has been called Heaven or the Light. (Throughout the book, the term \"Light\" will be capitalized wh en used in this sense.) In the Light there is a Review Stage where the being can reflect on the life just past, assessing the growth, learning, the fulfilled opportunities, the unfinished business, and any newly incurred imbalances or karmic debts. 42 There are also spiritual counselors who assist in this pr ocess. From that state, the being moves into the Halls of Learning and the process is repeated. This is the Wheel of Life, 43 the process of recycling for human spirits. Exploring the farther reaches of the mind through regression therapy is a fascinating journey. We are not at all limi ted to life on Earth. Some clients recall going back and forth between this planet and some \"homeworld\" they remember as their primary destination after leaving the Light of Creator Source. They describe coming here for various reasons, and retu rning \"home,\" or longing to return. 32"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind Past Life Recall As Extraterrestrial The therapist's suggestions to \"Recall. ..\" or \"Locate...\" are powerful com- mands to the subconscious mind. If those le vels of mind designated subconscious and unconscious do hold the soul memories of other lives, the space between lives, and existence on other worlds, then thes e memories are available and easily uncov- ered through regression therapy in an altered state of consciousness. For the past 16 years we have conducted experiential seminars in past life exploration. The seminar includes several group regressions: to locate the source of present day emotions of anger, fear, sadness, and guilt; to explore one's primary love relationship; to rediscover one's purpose in life; and to understand the per- ceived separation from God. The instructi on for the regression on one's purpose is direct and effective. \"Recall the first time you chose to come to the planet Earth.\" After a few moments of silen ce, the instruction is alte red slightly and repeated to prompt remembering from there instead of here. \"Recall the experience of choosing for the first time to go to the planet called Earth.\" Over the years, we and other therapis ts and seminar facilitators who conduct similar regressions, have found between 50% and 70% of any group will recall the experience of choosing to come to planet Earth from somewhere else. For those who find such a memory, we guide them in discovering the pur pose for coming. It is a profound memory and startling knowle dge for most people. 44 Nearly everyone reports the original purpose for coming was to bring light, love, healing, spiritual learning, and awak ening of consciousne ss for the inhabitants of earth. People describe th is place as a very dense, he avy planet and this heaviness dulls the consciousness and dims the memory . Those who came earlier forgot their true identity and whence they came. And many of the beings among the waves of helpers who came with that same purpose have also forgotten. This era has been called a time of great awakening. Perhaps some of our \"space brothers\" have come on that same mission again. Unfortunately, some of the \"aliens\" seem to be here to take advantage of the confusion. Most of the time it's difficult to tell them apart. Kathy Kathy recalled a lifetime on another wo rld. She described it as \"returning home for further instructions\" before continui ng in a long series of earth lifetimes. She was a teacher and healer, and it was her job to bring th at energy to this planet. Sam Sam, a highly intelligent young man, was seriously depressed, even suicidal, and felt like he had lost his direction and purpose in life. In session, he recalled his origins on another planet. He was one of a group of students attending an institu- tion of higher learning there, and the trip to earth for a human incarnation was nothing more than a field trip for his group. He had lost contact with them and felt alone in his mission. As he touched into the consciousness of his group, he learned that many who had come had also forgotte n their mission, had lost sight of their 33"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"CEVI purpose, and more than a few had committed suicide. With this regression, Sam's depression eased, he regained his enthusiasm for following the spiritual path of learning, and I suspect he will go on to fulfill his assignment here on his field trip to earth. Ted Ted attended our Basic SRT Training Co urse. As a hypnotherapist, he wanted to expand his knowledge and skills. He volunteered as a demonstration subject. The tale that emerged is not uncom mon, yet was quite disturbing to Ted. We discovered an attached ET which had been in place for a long time. Not unusual. It's stated purpose was to gath er data on the human animal in normal earth life circumstances. Again, a very common situation. What came next was a bit unusual, though we have heard it in other sessions. I directed Ted to locate the origin of this ET connection. He was very surprised at what his own subconscious mind and the attached ET disclosed. Prior to the present lifeti me, the being that is now manifesting as Ted was an associate of the attached ET! They knew each other! They were fellow citizens on another planet, in another density; Ted was an ET! His past lives were on another planet. This bit of knowle dge was hard for him to accep t, yet there it was, coming from his own memory banks. As part of a \"scientific\" team in the ot her place, Ted agreed to come into the Earth cycle as a sort of guinea pig for the experiment. As a hu man being, he would be a living laboratory for hi s teammates to study withou t the hostility or resistance that a native earth inhabitant mi ght exhibit toward invasive ETs. They had followed him to Earth, moved into his physical body when Ted was very young, and had set up their equipment. Whatever the effects, he was used to it since it had been there nearly all his life. Ted chose to release the ET and get rid of the equipment, the communication and control devices that had been implan ted. He did not like what he had discov- ered about his own past, a nd he now chose a different course. He literally aban- doned the alien project and chose human lif e. The ETs didn't like it, but they honored his choice. They had always know n it was one of the possible outcomes of such an experiment if Ted discovered them. 45 The Nordic Type One type of alien being which has been reported often in recent years has come to be identified as the \"Nordic\" type. Blond, blue eyed, kindly and helpful. Apparently these types have been coming to earth for millennia. Several clients have related past lives in Central America during which they took the role of priest or priestess, se eking to teach and lead the \"primitive\" peoples to higher spiritual awareness. They described themselves as tall, blond, fair skinned, Nordic in appearance. They remembered the instructions they received periodically from their homeworld, either by direct communication or by traveling there and returning to earth. They were ex traterrestrials who had come to help the people of earth. Now they stay on as humans. 34"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind For a time the local citizen s listened to the wisdom of these sky people. then finally rebelled and slaughtered the \"different\" ones. After the eradication of the ET influence and guidance, the native chie fs and priests distorted the spiritual teaching and practices. With the failure to understand the pries tly rituals and incantations as commu- nications with the homeworld of their fo rmer spiritual leaders, the ceremonies became empty rituals to imaginary \"gods\" who did not answer their prayers, did not fulfill their needs. Even tually, the chiefs started the pr actice of human sacrifice in an attempt to send \"messengers\" to the gods with prayers for assistance. Blood sacrifice, the taking of human life in such ritual, was ineffectual, yet it became a common routine fo r those humans who assumed power in leadership positions. Human sacrifice became an inst rument of fear, a way of maintaining control over the people. This was a gross misuse of power and a terrible distortion of the meaning of the rituals and incanta tions, which were originally a means of communication between the \"Nordi c\" ETs and their homeworld. When we explore this kind of situation through the far memory of a client who was the victim in such a ritual in a pa st lifetime, we uncover the DFEs controlling the priests and executioners. This type of human activity always seems to be motivated, controlled, and perpetuated by the dark forces. The anguish of the \"messenger\" about to be victimized is an energy which can be collected by the DFEs. The energy of f ear in the citizens, as well as the blood lust in the onlookers as the crowds attend the sacrifice, can also be harvested and used as \"food\" for the DFEs and their superiors. This mechanism of harvesting energy takes on greater significance as we explore the ET/DFE connection in later chapters. When a client discovers such a distur bing memory, it can be a past life per- sonality, though just as often it is the traumatic death memory of an attached entity. If it is an entity, the remote release of the dark beings fr om that past scene, and the clearing of the dark energy residue still clinging to the earthbound spirit of the sacrificial victim, will allow this troubl ed soul to go home to the Light. Under- standing the mistakes made in that lifeti me will lead to free dom. Peace and healing can come at last. When we hear the details of lives as sacrificial victim s, it is nearly always the same lament. The ceremony of human sacrifi ce was for the purpose of appeasing the gods, or for carrying a request for help, a prayer to the gods for much needed assistance, such as rain for the crops, or healing the people from some sort of plague. The one carrying the urgent message mi ght even volunteer for the service out of loving devotion to his people. A liquid po tion, always recalled as bitter in taste, was given to the \"messenger\" and soon they would feel a delicious euphoria. Next, a physical numbness and paralysis would set in. Breathing and heartbeat would cease, the spirit would lift out of the phys ical body, and would begin searching for the gods, eager to deliver the message. Wh at followed was disappointment, disillu- sionment, and anger. The messenger would search in the lower astral realms, and 35"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"CEVI the \"gods\" were not to be found there; the message could not be delivered. The mission was meaningless, the loving devo tion lost in the nothingness. Such an entity, overwhelmed with frustration, feel ings of betrayal, disappointment, and anger, often attached to a living person nearby. If the messenger chosen was a vestal vi rgin, the process often included a last minute sexual encounter with the male priest or priests, usually against the wishes of the sacrificial victim. There was no defense against such violation. Beyond Death After the death scene in a past life regression, the newly deceased spirit usually moves toward the Light. Here in the Earth cycle, the Light is always golden-white, warm, and very bright. The description is similar to the accounts of the near death experience, th e NDE, except the spirit is joined by other beings who come to guide the newcomer completely into the Light. Only when the newly deceased spirit moves fully into the Light is th e past life really over. But that is only one possible option for the newly deceased sp irit. We will explor e some of the other possibilities. 36"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind C h a p t e r 3 SPIRIT RELEASEMENT THERAPY Regression therapy has expanded and developed far beyond the process of uncovering repressed childhood memories. Recovery of soul fragmentation is an integral part of the clinical practice of regression therapy. Spirit Releasement Therapy and past life therapy cannot be separated in clinical sessions. In practice, the therapist trained in Past Life Ther apy (PLT) and Spirit Releasement Therapy (SRT) can determine the differ ence between a past life pe rsonality and an attached spirit of a deceased human being. There are specific methods of differentiating between the two, and the treatment is diffe rent for the two situations. Other types of attached entities and energies can also be recognized, identified, and released. Spirit Attachment The notion of spirit possession may seem preposterous within the context of contemporary scientific thinking and trad itional mental health practice. However, when I began to read the contemporary literature on the subject, I was intrigued and very curious about the po ssibility that it mi ght be valid in so me way. The signs and symptoms of this condition were surf acing in many of my clients; it would have been silly to ignore this phenomenon. In addition, it would have been scien- tifically and professi onally irresponsible to deny the evidence. Ignorance and denial have no place in the search for truth, es pecially within the scientific method. I continued to observe and record, astounded at what I was uncovering through my clients in altered states. The basic assumption that must be considered in consciousness research is that conscious ness is separate from the physical body and therefore it survives death of the body. Traditionally, this consciousness is called the spirit or soul. In my clinical practice, I was e xploring the spiritual reality. I devoured the literature on the subject of possession and exorcism. This included the traditional religious texts, the spiritually oriented volumes, some of them channeled, the work which came out of the Spiritualist movement, the scholarly works, and some recent books written by fervently religious deliverance ministers. Through the ages, the afflic tion has been widely acknowledged and accepted by most peoples on earth. Opinions on the specific details of the condi- tion vary considerably, depending on the philosophic views, scientific and educa- tional background, and religious beliefs of the various authors. I had no precon- ceived ideas, no limiting belie f system to interf ere with my project of discovery in the clinical setting. By asking many questions during private sessions with clients, I learned a great deal about this spiritual affliction. The narratives were consistent, intelligent, logical, and in no way did the clients s how any signs of psychotic or paranoid delusions. I continued to observe and que stion, gradually forming a basic hypoth- 37"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"CEVI esis, a clinical model to e xplain the phenomenon of spirit attachment, and a rational method of treatment. A very few people ar e apparently immune to such intrusion. However, it seems that nearly everyone, at some time during their lifetime, experiences some kind of interference from discarnate entities or energies. Any number of entities can attach to any pa rt of the physical body: the head, neck and throat, the chest, abdomen, or pelvis, the sexual organs, or the limbs. An entity can attach to any organ, especially if there is a physical weak ness or impairment. An organ transplant recipient may gain the heart and soul of the deceased donor. This condition is not uncommon. 46 An entity can be caught in the aura, the energy fi eld surrounding the physical body. 47 The entity can be lodged in one of th e chakras, the energy systems of the body, and can affect the organs and behavi or associated with that chakra. 48 In one case, a young woman complained that her 6-year-old son had begun making offensive sexual advances toward her. During a remote spirit releasement on her son, conducted through her as the intermedia ry, we discovered the earth- bound soul of an adult male affecting his second chakra. Th is is the seat of se xual energy. The entity was released and the unwanted behavior ceased. Ideally, after a person dies, the soul rises toward the brightness, the Light, the Heavenly place. However, humans with big egos have a way of complicating things, and this passage is not always so easy or direct. Fear, anger, sadne ss, guilt, the need to be right, even curiosity, can often keep the newly deceased soul from moving on in the right direction. The desire for vengean ce after a violent and wrongful death may keep the soul bound to the ear th plane, focused on this insane desire. Vengeance is a signal, an open invitation to the DFEs. A person who feels guilty becau se of his behavior during life may fear punishment in the Light. A person who has rigid beliefs about life, death, and heaven, might be a bit confused by what is encountered after leaving the physical body. In one case, the spirit of a Baptist preacher was attached to his son. He was, by God, NOT going to heaven until it was the way he knew it was supposed to be! After a brief education on the spiritual reality, he change d his mind. He bid loving farewell to his son and moved into the Light. A victim of fire or worse, atomic explosion, will avoi d the Light, which is very bright, because of the memory of death connected with a bright light. We have found groups of Japanese school children, souls lite rally fused together by the blast of the A- bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima. A yo ung mother who dies may remain with her little children out of duty, love, and guilt at leaving them so young. A jealous, possessive husband might decide to stay with his wife. The grief of family and friends can hold a newly deceased spirit from going on. Olivia Someone who dies hungry for food or in need of drugs often attaches to an unsuspecting host in order to fulfill that need. Olivia was divorced and liv ing with her mother, and she gained nearly 30 pounds in one year. Her father had died at the beginning of the year, unable to recover from surgery for stomach cancer. He was 38"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind being fed by intravenous tube. He died hungry. Her mother sensed his presence for a short while following his death, then suddenly he seemed to be gone. He had joined his daughter and that is when she started to overeat. She did not realize the extent of the weight gain until her twin sister visited at Ch ristmas time, still sl im and pretty. It was her father's insatiable hunger that drove her to overeat and gain the unnecessary weight. A newly deceased spirit might attach to another living human immediately after its death. This happens regularly in hosp itals, especially in the nursery where the newborns are kept. It is similar to a new car buyer going through a dealer's showroom checking out the new models. A newly deceased spirit can remain in a favorite place such as a house, which makes it a haunted house. The soul con- sciousness of a deceased soldier can remain on duty at an assigned location such as the battlefields of the Civil War or Vietnam, a fort like the Alamo, or a vessel like the battleship Arizona, sunk in Pearl Harbor. If a person dies with an attached entity, there are several things that can happen. If the newly deceased soul is strong enough, it will carry the attached entity or entities to the Light. The attached one can break away and either attach to someone else or wait in the gray place, an intermediate stage within the lower astral plane between the earth plane and the Light. It will recognize the former host and can reattach in the next incarnation. This can continue for many lifetimes of the host. The newly deceased soul might not be strong enough to go to the Light with the entity attached. The soul then becomes earthbound with an attached entity. This is termed a nested entity. This nesting can extend dozens or hundreds of layers deep. In many cases, the nesting within a person began many lifetimes, perhaps centuries before. The nested entitie s break away, wait in the gray place, and reattach when the person come s into earth life again. We of ten find that the innermost one is a DFE. This is especially true in most cases of living humans with attached ETs; we discover DFEs nested within the ET. Attachment to any given person may be completely random, even accidental. An attachment can be benevolent in nature, se lf serving to fulfill a personal need of the spirit, malevolent in intention, or completely neutra l. Some investig ators in this field estimate that between 70% and 100% of the population are affected or influenced by one or more discarnate entitie s at some time in their lives. 49 Our language reflects an inner knowledge of this condition: \"What got into you?\" \"What possessed me to do that?\" \"What came over you?\" \"I'm not myself today.\" The popular comedian, Flip Wilson, e xpressed the concept with the comic line: \"The devil made me do it.\" 39"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"CEVI The Grouch One 62-year-old male client discovered an d released an attached female entity who had died of an ab dominal infection. She had joined him in the hospital after his surgery for appendicitis at ag e six. The physical similar ity of abdominal infection was like a magnet for the female spirit. The story within his family was that he had never smiled after his surgery. The woman seemed to be quite grouchy and that characteristic affected the man's personality from that time forward. The Football Hero and the Demon One function of the DFEs is to undermine love in any form, any time, any place in any situation that involves pe ople, loving couples, families, groups of people, or institutions which serve people. Individually , healthy self love can be equated with self esteem. Here's what happened to one teenager, a high school football hero. Tommy was plagued wi th disbelief about his own ab ility. He suffered terribly low self esteem. Even though he was an ex cellent player and a high scorer on the football field, he rejected the claims ma de by other people regarding his success. With assistance, he discovered an attached DFE. It was the dark entity that had undermined his self confidence and self esteem. It also urged him to commit suicide. Tommy died in an auto accident, recklessly an d purposely. As a spirit, he was held earthbound by the DFE and he attached to Bennett, another student. Tommy was discovered in a session with Bennett, a 37-year-old man who had suffered complex epileptic seizures on av erage once a week for more than a dozen years, often while driving an automobile. His seizures began about age nine after he fell off a bicycle and h it his head on a cement cur b. That's when Tommy at- tached. The seizures continued for about seven years, then ceased. The seizures began again when Bennett was in his mid twenties shortly after his first son was born. Tommy joined Bennett because he had bullied Tommy's little brother on the school yard. The motive was revenge. It wa s not difficult for the DFE to encourage revenge as the young man was already rese ntful toward Bennett about the way he had treated his little brother. The DFE was released appropriatel y. Some work was completed with Tommy on his false beliefs about his skill and success. The DFE had seriously distorted his thinking about himself. He realized his mistaken perceptions and his harmful effect on Bennett. He also lamented his choice of suicide. He apologized to Bennett and gratefully went into the Light. Eight months after the releasement pr ocedure, Bennett had experienced only three seizures. For him this was nothing short of a miracle. The Business Consultant And The Alien Paul was a business consultant and he was quite successful. Strangely, the quality of his consulting advi ce improved after his near-d eath experience. During a session, Paul recalled his NDE after surgery in a hospital. He wa s aware of moving far away from his body , then moving slowly back in. At home after his release from 40"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind the hospital, he often awoke about 4:00 AM, his mind very active, with ideas streaming in. This idea stream pertaine d to his clients and the information was brilliant. Paul recalled his NDE in detail. As he described moving back toward the body, I guided him in explori ng carefully to see if anything else had entered his body during his absence. Star tled by what he discovered, he described an energy form which he said looked like \"Gumby,\" a clay cartoon figure. As he came fully into his body, the energy form s queezed out into a very thin layer. The energy form claimed (through Paul's voice) to be from another place. It had never been human in its own body here on earth, and it did not impose human ailments. It had none of the malevolent char acteristics of the DFEs. It was an alien who had come to experiment with the ment al functioning of this human. It actually offered good ideas for the mundane activity of human endeavors. Paul refused to release the alien; it was good for business. This is always the client's choice. Several months later, Paul phoned to let us know he had decided to release the alien. He realized he did not like his thoughts to be under the control of the alien, even though it helped his consultin g business. Dependence on a non-physical being can prove to be an open door to spir it attachment by more destructive spirits. Possession and Exorcism The term spirit possession suggests tota l takeover of a living human by a non- physical entity of some kind, which rarely ha ppens. In dealing w ith clients, I came to understand the condition as spirit interference or spirit attachment rather than possession. Spirit attachment implies connection, cli nging, holding, a parasitic invasion of the host and this is a much more accurate description of the condition. Historically, the task of eliminating the intruding spirits has been assigned to the shaman, holy man, healer, or priest of both civilized and indigenous popula- tions. The older terms, exorcism, depossession, disobsession, casting out, and deliverance, indicate little or no concern or compassion for the attached entity, which is also a God-created being, even if it is a \"demon.\" Religious texts assume a preconceived notion of demons, and the classic adversarial approaches to the rituals of exorcism are steeped in superstition and fear. The traditional method of exorcism seems violent and without compassion. Developed over a long period of time, the Roman Ritual continues as the model of exorcism in the Catholic Church. 50 This concept of exorcism is based on the explicit command and example of Jesus to \"cast out devils,\" though the Church to this day fails to differentiate between demons, the minions of Lucifer, and the earthbound souls of deceased humans. They certainly don't recognize ETs. Deliverance ministry is a growing part of charisma tic Christianity. 51 Casting out demons in the name of Je sus is accomplished in a highly emotionally charged setting, and the results can be dramatic and traumatic. It is a shotgun approach to the problem, often very effective, though born of fear and se t in a context of preconceived beliefs about the spirit realm. Again, there is no recognition of 41"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"CEVI earthbound human souls or ETs. About the middle of the last century, the philosophy of Spiritualism 52 was born. The movement was popular in the Un ites States, and it soon spread to Europe as Spiritism. 53 The two primary tenets of the philosophy of Spiritualism are: 1. Survival of consciousness after physical death. 2. The possibility of communication be tween living people a nd the spirits of the \"dead\" through the voice of a medium. A medium is a pers on with psychic gifts, speci fically the ability to allow another consciousness to speak through their voice mechanism. The medium becomes the connecting link, the \"telephone \" between the human facilitator and a disembodied entity. In this way, commun ication is possible, and earthbound souls can be contacted. Once these troubled souls have a chance to express the anger, grief, demand for justice, hunger for f ood, drink, or drug, or even give a last message to a loved one, they can be released to their next step of spiritual evolu- tion: the Light. This seems to be the fi rst compassionate approach to releasing these confused souls. Countless lost souls were guided home to the Light. 54 In Brazil, remote spirit releasement is conducted routinely at the healing centers run by the Medical Spiritist Asso ciation of S<o Paulo. The work of disobsession, as it is called, is conducted by a gr oup of six mediums. Four of the people sit in a circle facing a fifth at the cent er. A sixth person ac ts as facilitator. The facilitator calls out for th e spirit that is interfering with the identified patient. That spirit incorporates, or enters into, the medium in the center of the circle. Fianlly, the spirit is expelled and apparently guided to its appropriate destination. This is a generous and compassionate service, performed free of charge. Spirit Releasement Therapy The development of the methods of treatment for the condition of spirit attachment covered several years. I coined the term Spirit Re leasement Therapy® (SRT) to describe the clinical (not ritual ) techniques. The entity and the client are released from each other and the entity is escorted by spirit helpers to its rightful place in the Light, wherever that might be. The word \"release\" means to set free from restraint, confinement or servi- tude; to relieve from something that confin es, burdens, or oppresses. It also signi- fies the relief or deliverance from sorrow , suffering, or trouble; discharge from obligation or responsibility; re linquishment of a right or claim; the act of liberating or freeing, as from restraint. Adding the suffix \"ment\" indicates the process of releasing. Each different type of en tity must be guided to its appropriate destination. That's what Spirit Releasement Therapy is about: discovering, identifying, and releasing the \"extras\" that are just along for the ride. 55 It is a gentle but firm, methodical and logical, rational approach to dealing with spirits or other non- physical beings. It works with EBs, DFEs, and ETs! Or any combination! SRT consists of six parts. The first step is to discover any and all (there is 42"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind never just one) attached entities. There are many clues which assist in the discovery of an attached entity. The second step is identification of th e various attached entities. There are many types of discarnate and non-physical energies that can and do attach. Clients have described several types of nearly huma n spirits, \"little people\" such as trolls, imps, gnomes, devas (nature spirits associat ed with plants which are found in cases of cocaine or marijuana addiction, for ex ample), the damaged souls of victims of genetic experimentation, crystals, shapel ess blobs and shadows, thought forms, implants of various kinds an d other unidentifiable energies which defy classification. However, most of the attached entitie s fall into one of three categories: 1. EBs: earthbound souls of deceased hu mans, including terminated preg nancies and mind fragments of living persons. 2. DFEs: the dark force entities, historically called demons. 3. ETs: extraterrestrials, aliens, or that is, beings from other worlds, dimen- sions or densities. The third step is dialogue with the entity (through the client's voice) to find out why it's here and what it wants, and to start the specific treatmen t which will lead it to release will ingly from the client. The fourth step is the actual release of the attached entity; each different type requires a different releasement process and each is taken to a different, specific destination. The fifth step is a guided imagery of li ght for the client. It is important to metaphorically fill the space le ft by the departing entities. The sixth step is ongoing therapy for the client. More entities can be found and released in subsequent sessions. Past li fe therapy is very effective in resolving current life problems. Recovery of lost soul fragments is essential to the client in order to increase the inner strength, the \"spiritual immune system.\" Inner child healing 56 is vital to restore balance to the life of the client. It is essential to resolve the conflicts and heal the emotional vu lnerability which firs t allowed the spirit attachment. This may prevent the recurren ce of spirit attachments in the future, though there is no absolute preventive meas ure, no immunity against attaching entities. Identification of Entities The condition of spirit possession or spir it attachment does not involve light beings. Angels, spirit guides, guardian angels and other such beings do not become attached and they do not use the energy of the person. They are here to assist, not force any agenda on the human; they are very patient. They do not make decisions for the person nor attempt to control in an y way. They are present to assist human beings, not to influence, manipul ate, exploit, or violate them. There are several ways of detecting an attached entity and differentiating it from a past life personality or fragment of consciousn ess. This is the primary question: 43"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"CEVI Dr. B.: \"Are you part of______ (client's name) or someone else?\" The past life character, a subpersonality, or an alter personality in a person with multiple personaliti es will state immediat ely that it is defin itely a part of the person. An attached human entity will usually tell it the way it is. Once an entity is discovered, this is the next question: Dr. B.: \"Have you ever been alive in your own human bod y? Have you ever been human in your own phys ical body, on this planet?\" The earthbound human spir it will immediately reply in the affirmative. The spirit of the terminated pregnancy is also aware of being huma n, though it has no experience of being born. The mind fragment of a living person knows its body is living right now. Non-human entities, DFEs, and ETs, w ill usually reply with an emphatic \"NO!\" The body scan is an effective method for discovering attached entities. The client is directed to focus within and by seeing and/or feelin g, scan the body and describe anything present. Dr. B.: \"Focus inward. Noti ce any shapes or shadows, faces or forms, tight- ness or tension, pain or other sensation, any emotional holding, any disruption of energy, any holes or vacant places, anything at all, anywhere in the body. Trust what comes and describe right out loud.\" The client moves deeper into altered state as the focus turns inward. Sensa- tions and images usually come up and are described clearly. The following ex- amples are typical: \"a pain in my lower back,\" \"a tightness in the neck,\" \"a black blob in my gut,\" or \"a meta l band squeezing around my h ead just above my eyes.\" The therapist uses the exact words of the client in the questions. The Human Soul Dr. B.: \"If that pain in your lower back wanted to talk, what would it say right now?\" Dr. B.: \"If that tightness in the neck could speak, what would it say, right out loud?\" Dr. B.: \"As you focus on that feelin g, what image comes, what are you experiencing?\" The words that come can be descriptions of emotional feelings such as anger or fear, the phrase can be a ssociated with an image or sc ene of a traumatic incident in this life or another incarnation during which the lower back or neck were wounded. The therapist must be sensitive to whatever information emerges at this time, and not criticize or reject what the client is experiencing, regardless of personally held beliefs. If it is a past life death scene of the client, it is processed to completion and resolution with past life therapy techniques. Any remaining emotion, especially blame and guilt, are resolved as this trauma is released. There is forgiveness, if necessary, and the newly deceased soul in th at lifetime is escorted to the Light by the beings who normally come to assist. This usually ea ses or eliminates the physi- cal symptoms in the present body caused by the residual emotional baggage from 44"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind the earlier lifetime. If it is the memory of a death trauma imposed by an attached entity, the event is processed only to the point of release for the entity. It is not fair nor appropriate for the client to experience the death pain and the emotional me mories of the entity as it goes through the entire process of reso lution of all the issues involved. It will have another chance in a future incarnati on to resolve its own unfinished business from the earlier existence. Wh at is done in the physical body must be undone in the physical body. Once the entity is willing to let go, it is carefully escorted into the Light by another spirit, often a loved and trusted family member or friend. If the tightness in the neck or the pain in the lower back was part of the death memory of an entity, then the trauma th e client was carrying and suffering from, both physically and in the memory banks of the subconscious mind, was never his/ hers, but imposed by the attached entity. There is no way to know all the cumula- tive effects on the host's physical and emotional time track through this life and any other since the entity's death and attachment to the host. The interference is incalculable. And this is just one single attachment. We never find just one attached entity. The different kinds of entities will give surprisingly specific and consistent responses to such queries as these. It is usually possible to identify the type of attached entity by the way they answer. Further questions firmly establish the identification. The questions continue. Dr. B.: \"Are you male or female?\" Usually, the EB re calls its gender. The termin ated pregnancy knows its gender. Dr. B.: \"How old are you?\" The answer is usually imme diate. The EB will declare its age. The terminated pregnancy has no age in years. This soul does know how many months along it was inside mother. Dr. B.: \"What year is it for you?\" The EB is fixated in the year of its death. There is no passing of time in spirit. The terminated pregnancy is not aware of any date. Dr. B.: \"What is your name?\" The EB usually knows its name. The terminated pregnancy has no name. Babies are not named until after the rite of passage of birth. The therapist offers this soul a chance to choose a name for itself. The little one may take a name like White Cloud, or Pi nk Rose, or Peace. Dr. B.: \"Where were you before you joined _______ (client's name)?\" The EB will have a clear memory of its own life, its death and the events between that moment and the attachment to the host. The terminated pregnancy will usually describe being in the Light. 45"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"CEV1 Term in ated Pregn an cy Of course, most spirits of terminated pregnancies go to the Light. Those who don't find the Light usually stay with the mo ther or they might attach to the next fetus when mother becomes pr egnant again. It is not u nusual for a new baby to be born with an attached spirit of a would-have-been sibling. One female client accompanied and comf orted her adult daughter during an abortion. The spirit of the terminated fetus attached to its grandmother. In a scan of past lives it was discovered that she was supposed to have been its mother in a former lifetime, and she had aborted it th en. It had attempted to return to the family in this manner. In many cases of twins, one fetus may di e at some point early in the pregnancy. The fetal tissue is resorbed and all traces of the pregnancy disappear. The spirit of the deceased twin is often discovered w ith the surviving twin and adamantly claims the body as its own, no matter the age of the survivor. This entity will be angry at the host, defiant towa rd the therapist, and insist ent on staying. This is not an option. With love, they are gently released into the Light. Many cases of \"Vanishing Twin Phe nomenon\" (VTP) have come to light recently. Two in every 75 people are born as twins. According to medical statistics, between 75% and 85% of women with early diagnosis of twin pregnancy will only deliver one baby. In most cases of twins discovered after 15 weeks in utero, both fetuses will grow normally and be born.\" Writer and researcher Caryl Dennis 58 suggests the fetus is too large to resorb after the first trimester. She claims to have heard reports of VTP throughout the gestation period, including one case that o ccurred just two hours prior to delivery. One of the umbilical cords simply comes to an end! There is no valid medical explanation for many of these cases. Dennis, who claims to have a twin on an alien spacecraft, suggests these twins may be separated and removed by ETs in order to study growth and devel- opment of these closely related children in the different environments: earth and spacecraft. There may be other reasons as well. Her work has uncovered some fascinating as well as sinister overtones. In light of the VTP and after having encountered so many cases of spirit attachment after terminated pregnancies, we were better able to understand and assist the human/alien hybrids when we began to discover them as attached entities. Mind Fragment of a Living Person It is not unusual to find a mind fragment of another living person with a client. It first appears to be an attached entity, yet on further questioning, it turns out to be a fragment which has split away from the body/ mind of the other person. It can then go out-of-body and can attach to another living person. The mind fragment knows the present da te, since it is an integral part of someone livi ng in this reality in his/her own human body. It knows it s name and gender for the same reason. In its own mind, it has a clear, logical purpose for 46"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind being attached. This intrusion is not appr opriate, and the mind fragment is sent back to its own body/mind. The mind fragment often turns out to be from a parent of the client, usually the mother, who was very possessive during childhood. A possessive mother can become a possessing mother. 59 A person with an illness ca n parasite on a healthy person. This is a sort of psychic vampirism. In th e practice of Witchcraft and black magic, which always includes the DFEs, castin g a spell may involve a fragment of the practitioner's consciousness which can be transmitted to the victim. 60 Sister, Brother and ... A session with a young woman revealed an interesting twist. Gwen, the client, was well aware of the presence of Richie , her brother, who had died in an automobile accident some months earlier. The single car accident is often a suicide. 61 Richie acknowledged this was the case; he had chosen to die. She loved him deeply and she consciously welcomed him to join her after his death. A scan of past lives revealed that they had been lovers in other times. With very little explanation of his situati on and the effects he had on his beloved sister, Richie expressed his love for Gwen and was ready to release from her and move into the Light, but it appeared to be too far away. Since there was no resistance to the release from either of them, th is was an indication of some kind of interference. It turned out to be another en tity attached to Richie. As he explored within his own being, he discovered the entity, but could not identify it. The questions were addressed to this deeper entity. Dr. B.: \"You, the one inside Richie, inside Gwen, step forward and speak. You the one interfering with these people, speak up.\" Gwen: \"Yes, what do you want?\" Dr. B.: \"Who are you and what are you doing here?\" G.: \"I'm their mother.\" She revealed that she was truly their moth er in this lifetime and she had attached to her son when he was about two years old. As mother was still living, this was a separated fragment of her consciousness. Her possessive and overpowering love, along with her fear of inade quacy for the job of raising a child, had caused her to fragment and attach to her tiny baby boy. In the classic description of spirit atta chment or possession, the living person is possessed by the spirit of a deceased person. Here was the reverse situation, in which a deceased spirit was possessed by a living person. 62 Non-Human Entities Some of the entities cl aim that they have never been alive in their own human bodies. Hostility, arrogance, and disruptive be havior mark the dark force entity, or DFE, the true demonic being which has never been human. While there is a hierarchy of dark force beings spread across the fa bric of time, space, dimension, and the universe of universes, most claim alle giance to the Lucifer energy. They fear punishment for failure and they blindl y obey the commands of their superiors. There has been speculation that a demon is a projection of the human shadow, 47"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"CEVI the extemalization of the darker side of our personalities, as described by Carl Ju ng. 63 In 17 years of clinical experience in this f ield, I have witnessed s cant ev idence of that correlation. DFEs ar e not the shadow. W hen a client discovers these entitie s, the reaction is of ten f ear and disgust. The se do not cal l the mselves \"de mons,\" they call the mselves dar k. \"De mon\" is a designation assigned by huma ns. We use t he generic ter m \"dark f orce entity\" to mor e accurately describe these errant beings. The DFEs can be assisted in their own tra nsfor mation and release d appropriatel y in to their own place in the Light . Dark Force Entities Again, from the body s can descripti ons: Dr. B.: \"If that black blob in your gut had a face, what would it look like? \" C: \"Really ugly. Fangs a nd red eyes.\" Black and red are the signal colors of the DFEs. The red eyes are a dead giveaway. The demonic entity displays red eyes most of the tim e. Less of ten, the eyes m ay be a m enacing black, a fiery orange, a sickly ye llow, or an oily, ominous green. These shape-shifters can attempt to i mpersonate a loved one, a helping angel, even the Christ figure, but the eyes, the wi ndows of the soul, give the m away. In these false guises, the DFE can hold the norm al color f or less than a minute , the n the red begi ns to show. Dr. B.: \"If th at black blob in your gut had a sound, what would it be? \" The black blob wi ll make a sound the client will attempt to mimic, such as a growl , a s narl, or a hiss. This is most likely a DFE. The ther apis t directs anot her question, using the specific sound as a descriptor and a na me. Dr. B.: \"You, growler, if you c ould speak, what would you say right out loud? \" This entity knows it has been discovere d. That is grounds for punishm ent in the dark realm. The entity is angry, hostile, belligeren t, arrogant, fearf ul, and resentful toward t he the rapist. There is one typic al reply whic h is ne arly a diagnos- tic ce rtaint y by itsel f. C.:\"F__kyou!\" With this res ponse , we ar e fairl y ce rta in we are de aling with a DFE. One more questi on can be pos ed for a final conf irmation of iden tification of a DFE. Dr. B.: \" What color is the light where you com e from ?\" C: \"There is no light.\" Or, \"It' s just black.\" This conf irms the presence of a DF E. Many cli ents de scri bed a feeling of be ing bl ocked i n life. Th e dark being w ill describe its job assignm ent as stopping or blocking the client. After the DFE is released, t he client no longer feels bl ocked. The DFEs tr y to assum e ownership of other beings. They are c ontrolled absolutely by their superiors and they cl aim to have that sa me control over t he person they are plagui ng. The y are de fian t toward the therapis t who intends to oust them. C: \"Go away, I' m not leaving. She' s m ine!\" 48"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind Diagnosis is clear: this is a dark force entity, a DFE, histor ically termed \"demon,\" of which there are many levels and strengths. The procedure for dealing with DFEs is firm, specific, immediate, and effective. We call on the Warrior Angels of Light to surround and protect everything and everyone in the area where we are working, and the families and loved ones of all of us involved, to sta nd against the darkness as a bastion of light. The Warrior Angels of Light do not do ba ttle with the DFEs. And the DFEs do not mount a frontal attack on beings of light. We request assistance from a team of very powerful bein gs called the Rescue Spirits of Light who first bind the DFEs in an inescapable capsule of light. We guide the captured DFE to the discovery of its own spark of light at its center. (Every God-created being has that spark, the monad.) Its darkness disappears, its attitude changes totally, and it makes a choice for the Light. This is the transformation of a DFE. The Rescue Spirits of Light transport each of these transformed dark beings to its own place in the Light. The results are consistent and permanent. 64 ETs and Aliens Another type of at tached entity is non-human and non-demonic, usually a highly intelligent being who claims to be from \"far away,\" and only visiting here on some kind of mission. Rarely do they re call having been human in their own physical bodies here on earth, though some therapists are finding this more often. This is not the spirit of a deceased ET, not a DFE, but an alien in its normal form: non-physical. The aliens, or ETs , are not DFEs! Demons do not have to travel in space ships. ' Again, from the body scan: Dr. B.: \"If you could expand your awareness of that metal band squeezing around your head just above your eyes, what would you perceive?\" The metal band around the head just a bove the eyes is almost always an alien device, placed by extraterrestrials for the purpose of monitoring, communicating with, and controlling a human being. The band is not solid, physical metal as we know it, but an etheric, non-physical, energy form that appe ars metallic to the client in altered state of consciousness. There are many kinds of im plants, and this device causes pain when discovered in a session. Dr. B.: \"Expand your awareness. Describe the band.\" It is usually described as a crude piece of equipment. There may be one or more antenna extending from it. There are often wi res or connectors coming off it, going into the body at many different points, and other wire s leading up to a \"craft.\" The client at this point realizes this is an ET device. F ear and impotent anger often surface. This may lead into a memory of an alie n abduction, but the pur pose of this particul ar session is to discover and remove the device and the alie n technician(s) who are operating it, and anything else involved. The possibility of an abduction experience ca n be explored in a subsequent session. Once such a contraption is described by the client, we make a tentative 49"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"CEVI assumption that it is an ET device. This question is directed toward the one we assume to be present. In most cases, it responds. Dr. B.: \"To you, the one operating this de vice, have you been alive in your own human body?\" C: \"No.\" A simple statement. Dr. B.: \"What's the first thing you would say to us.\" C: \"Why are you interfering? What do you want? I have my job to do. We are gathering information.\" The speech is clipped, efficient, an d without emotion. They are here on business and they are serious about it. Dr. B.: \"Where are you from?\" C: \"Far away.\" Dr. B.: \"What color is the Light in your place far away?\" The light in their world or universe is always a different color from the golden-white light described in the NDE and the past life death experience in the human realm. The ETs describe their li ght as green, blue, pink, orange, lemon- silver, lavender, deep purple, blue-black, gray, or some other color. Some have been away from \"home\" for a long time, and don't know how to get back. They are not belligerent or openly hostile as the DFEs are. The replies often show impatience, low tolerance to human s, even a condescending attitude as if toward inferiors. The image arises of a white rat challenging the white-coated lab technician during the maze experiments. Th ey usually refuse to speak further. Identification is clear; this series of resp onses mark this entity as an alien, an ET. An ET Connection In a demonstration session in an SRT Tr aining, Brenda went quickly into an altered state. She felt a slight pressure around her head and discovered a typical metal band. She had no prior experience w ith ET interference, abduction, nor any memory of lost time. This was a total surprise to her. As we worked with her, th e pain increased. We called out to the technician in charge of the device, and this one qu ickly responded. We called to this one's superior, and firmly requested that we be connected to the highest authority in charge of this operation. This finally le d to the homeworld council. They were willing to answer our questions. Yes, th ey knew full well about the devices at- tached to many humans like this woman. Ye s, they were just ga thering information, scientific data. And why were we interf ering with their activ ities? These typical responses identified the intruders, and specifically the one with her who was operating the device, as ETs. They were hostile and refu sed to remove the device. They claimed the right to take over humans at random, without rega rd for harm or damage to the host/ victim of this intrusion. This attitude c onfirms the influence of DFEs. These were apparently members of an alien civilization controlled by DFEs. We completed the process of discovery and release of the DFEs, from the little dark one attached to and controlling th e technician to the high dark being 50"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind dominating the homeworld council. The attitude of the ETs always changes after this release. The bored technician is tired a nd is ready to go home, and the homeworld council is grateful for the re lease from the tyrannical di ctatorship and total bondage they experienced under the dark masters. The ETs agreed to remove the devices from the client and from all other humans they had intruded upon in this wa y. The pain ceased and Brenda was greatly relieved, astonished at what she had disc overed and experienced. She realized how they had influenced her, an d could feel that certain th ings within her were very different. Her husband reported later that he would have paid $ 1,000 to gain this kind of assistance for her had he known it was available. He was delighted with the changes in his wife. ETs And The College Student A variation on the headband is the metallic skullcap. It extends over the entire head, and comes down to the same level ove r the eyes as the band. We discovered such a device on a young woman during a re mote releasement session requested by her father. Elena was a college student, and during her senior year her behavior had seriously deteriorated. Within the year pr ior to the session, she had grown rebellious and defiant. She moved away from home with a female friend with different social values than the family, began using alcohol, frequenting student bars, attending rock concerts, and gathering \"creepy\" friends. She experienced mood swings, and would act very hostile on the days her parents would pray for her. In this session, the father perceived the skullcap immedi ately and described two antennae projecting from it. The technician was discovered, but when we focused on the leadership hierarchy, he perceived \"other-worldly\" beings, yet in some location on planet Earth. We qu estioned this, but continued observing. He was \"seeing\" a highly technical inst allation where many of these beings, including humans in military uniforms, se emed to be working. These other-worldly beings were diaphanous yet quasi-physic al, highly intelligent, not in the least threatened by our discovery of their presence. 65 And yes, they were on this planet. These beings were conducting some sort of mind control experiments on many humans, with permission by some human authority, and absolutely refused to cease their operations. As the therapist and facilitator of the sessions, I usually make a demand for the client's sovereign right of individual free dom and free will in such cases. Usually it works, someti mes not so well. This bein g disdainfully agreed to release this one woman from the project, but no one else. This aroused my curiosity and I asked: Dr. B.: \"How many humans on this plan et are you affecting in this way?\" The immediate, unmistakable, and ominous reply: C: \"Ask your government.\" Father perceived him turning his atten tion away from us. We were unimportant to him, as was the single female subject he had just discarded from his project. There was an unmistakable feeling of malevolence and personal threat. That 51"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"CEVI was enough. While I do not concur with th e conspiracy theorists regarding the Government-ET connection, I believe the intelligence agencies are capable of covert nefarious activ ities involving citizens. I also believe that psychic abilities and mind control have been expl ored and developed to a highly practical level. We were not going to explore that situation, no matter our curiosity. This was my personal choice. We turned to the next aspect of the re mote session, recovery of soul fragmen- tation. There was a high degr ee of fragmentation, or s oul loss. At age 20, what caused that? We managed to recover some fragments. This is more effectively accomplished working directly with the client. Even so, we seemed to accomplish a good bit of improvement in the young woman's condition. Her father called soon after the brief remote session. He had begun to see behavior and attitude changes in his daught er, and he was thankful for the session. It is terribly painful to lose a child to anything. It is an unimaginable violation to lose a child to entities such as DFEs and ETs in some ki nd of mind control experi- ment. But to our own government? This is an outrage beyond comprehension. The possibility begs for further investigation and discovery. Remote Spirit Releasement Spirit Releasement Therapy is normally conducted directly, with the client and the therapist together in the same location. The work can also be done remotely, with the client or target person at a dist ance, even if they do not know the work is being done for them. We consider the remote work as a sort of prayer for help. The results of the remote releasement work validates not only the clinical framework and techniques of SRT, but also the concept of non-local reality and the connectedness of all consciousness. Remote spirit releasement requires an intermediary, a surrogate to act as the medium, or connecting link. In an altered state of consciousness, it seems that most of us can connect with the minds of other beings, even ourselves in past times and future times. We can connect with others who have left the phys ical body in death. We can visualize distant locations and per ceive accurately what is happening. In more primitive times and indigenous culture s, the shaman would enter an altered state and travel or \"journey\" for various purposes, for example to check the condition of family members and friends at distant locations, or to locate herds of caribou. 66 In sessions with clients, we routinely conduct remote spirit releasements on children, rebellious teens, alcoholic hus bands who would not come for a session, aging parents or other family members who live a distance away, or someone in coma. In a therapy session we are working on the family system. Whatever affects one member can also affect others. This is an important part of any private session. The results can be seen immediately. The client is directed to visualize or get a sense of the target person. Next the client connects with the perceived eyes of the other. There is little doubt when that connection is made. Next, we ask for High Self permission before proceeding with 52"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind the work on the target person. Clients descri be the permission as a smile on the face of the other person, a nod of the head, a pleading call for help, a red neon sign saying \"YES,\" or some other definite reply. Rare ly is the answer \"NO.\" If it is, we end the remote session. Once we have permission from High Self , the process is the same as with any direct spirit releasement. The client be comes the connecting link, the communication line to the target person, or persons in the case of a spir it releasement on several of the client's family members. It is a courageous act and a very loving gift for the others involved. The Non-local Connection The phenomenon of channeli ng, or allowing another consciousness to speak through the voice, is well documented. 67 Remote viewing, or pe rception of a location or activity at a distant place or time, has been studied and verified in careful experiments. 68 The power of prayer to heal at a distance has been established in a number of studies. 69 This ability to connect might be described as a psychic gift though most clients can accomplish a remote connection in an altered state. This is described as \"non-local connection.\" 70 It can also be consid ered as evidence of Universal Oneness, a ba sic spiritual principle, 71 the connectedness of all things, everywhere and everywhen. 72 Remote communication is possible in th is way with beings who are backward or forward in time, far distant in space, aliv e or deceased, and apparently in other dimensions (whatever that means). There seem to be no barriers to such remote viewing and remote communication, and th erefore, remote spirit releasement. When a client, in altered state, is recalli ng and reliving an alien abduction experience, there seems to be a non-local, yet very real, connection with the event itself. We can use the remote techniques and speak with the ET who performs the physical examination or implantation of th e communication/monitoring device. Time as it exists on the earth plane is not the sa me for the aliens. The dimension we call time seems to be complete ly malleable for the ETs. I don't pretend to understand this, yet I have observed the success of the techniques of past life therapy, spirit re leasement therapy, and remote spirit releasement therapy. Extrapolating from this success, I have come to accept the validity of these distant, non-local connections and trust that something beneficial has been accomplished through the remote work with the aliens and their civilizations. I intuitively know the work leads to the healing of many souls in those distant places, perhaps in other dimensions. 53"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"CEVI C h a p t e r 4 UFOS AND ALIEN ABDUCTION Our sun is a small star near the outer e dge of one arm of the spiral galaxy we call the Milky Way. The nearest stars in the galaxy are Alpha and Proxima Centauri, and it takes a particle (or wave) of light about four years to reach us from those stars, traveling at the rate of 186,000 miles per second. Many of the stars we see in the night sky are not stars like our sun but entire galaxies, some much larger than our own, that are so far away they appear as tiny points of light. With all the stars out there it is almost certain that more than a few have orbiting planets similar to our own solar syst em. It is inconceivable that life exists nowhere but on the planet earth. Many peop le have speculated on the possibility of intelligent life developing somewhere in the universe at some time during the 15 billion years since it began. 73 Scientists estimate our own earth is about 5 billion years old and look what has happened here! In 1996, the announcement of a possible life form, th ough primitive, detected on a rock from the planet Mars, caused a flurry of speculation and excitement among scientists and the general public. The rock was thought to have been ejected millions of years earlier, possibly in a volcanic eruption, thrust beyond Mars gravity, and eventually caught by Earth's gr avity. It was discovered in the Arctic where a number of other rocks of simila r origin have been found. The exploration of Mars and the study of its history is c ontinuing with a series of 10 spacecraft called Mars Pathfinder. Soon after the Pa thfinder lands, a six wheeled rover about the size of a milk crate rolls down a ramp onto the surface of the red planet to examine, analyze, and gather soil and rock samples for return to Earth. This project is planned to last into the year 2005. Science fiction writers have given us countless sketch es of alien civilizations on distant planets and earth visitations by those extraterrestrials. In these imagina- tive tales, aliens approach earth and her inhabitants for many reasons: to share their advanced technology and knowledge with pr imitive earthlings; to conquer and take over our population using high tech wea pons against our crude weapon systems (similar to the way Europeans swept over the Native American populations of this country using firearms against bows and arrows); friendly commercial trading of goods and services; to enslave humans as workers on their planet; to gather hu- mans as food as we do the \"lower anim als\" of earth; perhaps to live on earth as inhabitants because their own homeworld was destroyed. Reports of mysterious flying craft and unearthly beings are part of earth's history. 74 Drawings on stones and in caves portray humanoid figures with a bubble- like shape around the head, similar to our own astronauts and their space helmets. The double star system of Sirius was only discovered in recent years after large telescopes were brought into use. Yet cave drawings in Africa crudely depict 54"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possess such a double star system and the Dogon people describe accurately where the system is located in the night sky. Their oral history contains accounts of being: from that place coming to earth. 75 In the Bible, the prophet Ezekiel gave a descrip- tion of what might be interpreted as a hi gh tech space vehicle and its inhabitants. 76 During his voyage to the new world, Chri stopher Columbus desc ribed a shiny craft flying across the bow of his ship and splashing into the ocean. In modern times, the number of UFO sightings, both from the ground and from aircraft, and reports of the alleged activities of aliens, in cluding animal muti- lation and abduction of humans, has increa sed dramatically. For a time after World War II, the U. S. Air Force investigated UFOs, concluding that, though nearly one fourth of the sightings remained unexp lained, the phenomena of UFOs posed no threat to national security. As of 1969, the Air Force admitted no official interest in the subject. 77 Apparently the military still seems to be very interested in the field. Are UFOs real or imagined? Many appare ntly physical vehicles, visible to the naked eye and the radar screen, have suddenly disappeared off the screen. What happens to such craft which are present one moment and gone the next? There is evidence such as radar contact, video tape footage of ostensible unidentified flying objects, physical scars on human bodies, but only unfounded reports of saucers or alien bodies. At least such info rmation has not been made public. Crash sites that make the headlines ar e quickly declared off limits by law enforcement agencies. Military and civilia n pilots, and astronauts, who report UFOs are ordered, even threatened, into maintaining silence about such encoun- ters. Some authors claim there is a law agai nst contact with alien beings. If so, this would tend to silence those who have had contact. Secrecy reigns! Out of this secrecy grow many rumors, exaggerations of details, and the fear of a government c onspiracy to cover up and suppress the information. The federal government has been accused of propagating disinformation, presenting deliberate lies and misleading \"f acts\" regarding UFO sightings, landings, and recovered alien bo dies. So far there are no concrete an- swers for the public. It is possible that no one on earth re ally knows the truth about UFOs and extraterrestrial beings. Th e government is a convenient scapegoat for the fear and paranoia. Many people have accepted the possibility of a ma jor UFO cover-up by the U.S. government and other governments around the world. 78 The conspiracy theory has grown into a highly charge d emotional issue am ong UFO believers. The eminent Swiss psychiatrist, Carl Jung, addressed the issue of \"flying saucers.\" 79 In a letter to the Zurich newspaper, Weltwoche, he stated, \"So far only one thing is certain: it is not just a rumor, something is seen.'\" Jung suggested the possibility of indi vidual or collective hallu cination, perhaps as a response \"to fears created by an apparently insoluble politi cal situation which might at any moment lead to a universal catastrophe.\" This was written in 1954, at a time when the threat of nuclear devastation was very r eal. \"At such times men's eyes turn to heaven for help, and marvelous signs a ppear from on high, of a threatening or reassuring nature.\" The unkno wn objects seen in the sky might actually be shaped 55"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"CEVI by our psychic projections. Though he acknowledged the physical evid ence of UFOs as seen in radar blips, Jung focused on the psychic, sp iritual, and archetypal dimensions of the phenomenon. The disc or sphere shape, he suggested, was analogous to the mandala, the Sanskrit word for circle, an almost universal symbol of unity, protec- tion, a modern symbol of order, which organizes and embraces th e psychic totality. What might Jung speculate about the tria ngular shape described in more recent sightings? The thinking of Jung regarding archetypal images and psychic projections is echoed by authors Keith Thompson 80 and Jacques Valee. 81 Myths of fairies, elves, trolls, gnomes, angels, and demons abound in the richness of human legend through the millennia. Some contemporary investigators have added UFOs to this mythology. The Alien Abduction Experience People who report abduction experiences present a remarkably consistent picture of the sequence of events. It s eems as though certain patterns have been established and there is some standard operating procedure during alien abduc- tions. This has been reported throughout the world. The abduction experience can be confusing, traumatic, and terribly disruptive in a person's life. If the experiencers choose to talk about it, they are often ridiculed by friends and family, unless other members of the family have also been abducted. Even then, some people would rather not acknowledge the events. In some cases, family members have become estranged from one another following abduction experiences. Most mental health professionals are skeptical about UFOs and alien abduc- tion, and many are downright insulting in thei r attitude toward experiencers. This shows a deplorable ignorance of the field an d an unprofessional lack of compassion for the person who needs help in sorti ng out and integrating such an unsettling experience. In some cases, an abduction has led to a personal spiritual transforma- tive experience. If a person can get beyond the emotional and physical trauma, there may be a spiritual message or challenge to be gained. 82 Like other emotional and physical trauma and personal invasion, the experi- ence for many people must re main secret, and the stress caused by these events and memories can affect a person for years. Post traumatic stress disorder follow- ing combat and war experience, rape or kidnapping, or alien abduction is a very real condition. That so many people report and describe such experience indicates a frightening reality, so widely disparat e from consensus reality that it defies explanation, and we must pay attention w ith an open mind. If there is a larger reality than the materialistic, mechanistic, reductionist, Newton ian-Cartesian model of Western Science, it must be explored. It may be that our very survival is at stake, particularly if we are to surviv e our own crimes and excesses against each other and against the planet. According to some reported abduction cases, people are taken from automo- biles. These cases typically begin with a UFO sighting. The person (or persons) 56"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind stop the car to get a better look, then realize they cannot move; they become paralyzed and their mind goes blank. When they next become aware of their surroundings, a period of time has passed, typically about two hours or more, and they are either sitting in their car at the si de of the road, or they are driving on the road at some distance from where the sighting occurred. Some experiencers report seeing smallish \"people\" standing near a craft. They go aboard, accompanied by the small bein gs. Several humans may be involved and they walk or are lifted into the craft. In a few reported cases, the entire automobile and all passengers have been lifted aboard the spacecraft. An abduction can take place at night while a person is sleeping. If there is a partner, that one is \"switc hed off during the episode an d cannot be awakened. The abduction sometimes begins as a vivid dream and the details may remain hazy or unreal. A person might be aw akened by small beings in the bedroom. The aliens seem to come through the window in a bri ght beam of light, and they have been reported as coming through the ceiling, the wa lls, or closed doors. There is often a bright light source outside or in the ro om. The person is floated off the bed, through the wall or closed door or window and upward to the waiting craft. In some cases, two or more members of a family are lifted at the same time. Women who see their children taken at the same ti me are particularly distressed at their own helplessness. According to some reports, the abduction takes place when a person is involved with a group of people in some outdoor activity. Others in the group may become focused on something else or may be switched off as the target person walks away from the group and discov ers a craft and small beings waiting. The abduction may occur when a person is alone in broad daylight. They describe a flash of light, a swirling disruption of some kind, then a period of lost time, again, about two hours or more. Ther e is usually amnesia for the time period. In a relaxed and altered state of conscious ness in a session, the person can usually recall what happened during the period of lo st time. Some investigators use a type of hypnotic regression to explore the memories. 83 Many experiencers recall being lifted onto the ship or craft and led into a brightly lit room. The light em anates from the walls and su rfaces in the room; there are no light fixtures as such. They see equipment along the walls and an examining table. With the fear and co nfusion a person feels at this time, these memories may seem vague. The person may be kept in a waiting room for a time, then escorted by several small beings along a curved hallway or corridor into the brightly lit room. The scene resembles a modern surgery room in a hospital: clean, sterile, the personnel efficient and impersonal. In this scenario there are typically seve ral small beings doin g things with the equipment, and one who carefully undre sses the person. The abductee cannot move from the cold metallic table; there is a mental torpor and physic al paralysis. The small beings may perform simple physical examination procedures: taking skin, blood, and tissue samples from various parts of the body . In many abduction cases, the experiencer sees a taller being entering the room, obviously someone in 57"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"CEVI charge to whom the smaller beings defer. When this one shows up, the smaller ones often back away from the table, allowi ng full access to the person being examined. The abductee senses the authority and command position of this taller being. Some people describe this one as \"the doctor,\" even before it performs the \"medi- cal\" procedures. Some abductees have se nsed the smaller beings may be some form of intelligent ro bot or android rather than living beings. The taller being continues the physical procedures, including the extraction of eggs from females and sperm from male s. Many women have been impregnated during an abduction. Within a few months , these women are transported onto the ship again and the growing fetus is remo ved. These disappearing pregnancies have caused a great deal of emotional trauma to many women. Many UFO investigators have suggested that some kind of br eeding program is being conducted by the aliens. Toward the end of the ordeal, either the taller being or the smaller ones may remove or implant a small metallic device, most often in the ea r, nose or a sinus cavity. There is speculation that these devices may be for purposes of locating, monitoring, controlling, or so me sort of communication. Most abductees are returned to thei r own beds. Some have been dumped onto open fields or grassy areas outside thei r homes. They are then floated into their beds, with leaves or grass stuck to their nightclothes. It has been reported that some women's nightgowns have been put on backwards! Some people discover new blemishes or scars on their bodies, or blood on sheets and pillows. Nosebleeds are not uncommon after an abduction. Some of these metallic implants have fallen out or been removed by physicians. A few have shown up on xray film or on MRI scans in various loca tions in the head. There is no medical explanation. 84 Some abduction cases involve the entire family and friends as well. Dr. Karla Turner describes the horrors she and her family endured as they discovered the suspected signs and symptoms of typical alien abductions. 85 She also described unpleasant visits to her hom e by humans in m ilitary uniforms, wh ich might suggest an alternative explanatio n. This was not explained. Karla Turner closes her book with a statem ent about the very real presence of the aliens. And a plea that if we don't l earn the purpose of these alien intrusions, we will remain their helpless victims. Tragically, Dr. Karl a Turner died of cancer early in 1996. An intriguing correlation between the UFO abduction and the NDE has emerged. In two books by Raymond Fowler, The Watchers, and The Watchers II, Betty Andreasson Luca vividly describes he r abduction experiences. She is led by the aliens through a pa ssageway capped by a Great Door, for the purpose of meeting the One. The place where the One resides is called Home. This is a mag- nificent experience, and not unlik e some descriptions of the NDE. 86 In the second book, Fowler compares the differences and similarities between NDE and UFO abduction. 58"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind In The Omega Project, Ken Ring describes at some length the parallel be- tween UFO abductions and the NDE. Some NDEers return with a detailed account of a typical UFO abducti on experience. Ring suggests a third realm, between physical reality and the pure imagination, called the imaginal realm, 87 where such events occur. This realm or level of c onsciousness seems to be accessible when a person is in an altered state of consciousness. 88 An Abduction With A Twist Laura had recently left a 20 year marriage. She had some feelings of guilt over leaving, but it was something she felt she had to do. She was beginning to assert herself in the world in her own way. She was studying hypnotherapy as a new vocation and had just completed our course in SRT. She realized she had to do some personal work in a private session. In the class, we covered the various ty pes of attaching entities. We had briefly described the ET, but not abductions. That subject is covered in the SRT Interme- diate Course. We were about an hour into the sessi on and she had just completed an impor- tant piece of entity releasement work. Du ring the pause that followed, Judith had the distinct impression that Laura might have been abducted when she was young. A direct question about such an event cannot be asked. We are always careful about asking leading questions. Clie nts in altered state can some times be easily led; false memories can be implanted or generated. This is a great disservice to the client. Laura had no knowledge on the subjects of ETs, UFOs, or science fiction. She had only a vague interest and had not read any accounts of abductions or anything related. While such questions as these can seem to be leadin g, nothing in the questioning described or suggested what she later recounted. Judith began the questions. Judith: \"Laura, have you had memory lapses, or time lapses?\" Laura: \"Yes.\" She answered quickly, fi rmly, and with certainty. J.: \"How long has that been going on?\" L.: \"I... I can't... I don't remember my childhood. I have pictures of it... I've been having more come to me recently. So rt of flooding in. I'll remember things.\" J.: \"When was the last time, in your li fe, that you had a time lapse or a memory lapse?\" L.: \"Just don't have clear memories.\" J.: \"Alright. Has your thinking also been confused.\" L.:\"Yes.\" J.: \"How long has that been going on?\" L.: \"Past two or three ye ars. I don't know. Awhile.\" J.: \"When you hear the stories about the ET energies, about the things that happen with ETs, what happens in your heart, in your gut, inside of you?\" L.: \"Nothing.\" 59"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"CEVl J.: \"Have you ever seen any of the pictures of the ETs?\" L.:\"No.Hmm-um.\" Judith motioned me to continue. Bill: \"Have you read any of the books like Whitley Streiber's Communion, or any others?\" L.: \"No.\" Dr. B.: \"Have you ever been drawn to read any of those stories?\" L.: \"No.\" Dr. B.: \"Is there an aversion?\" L.: \"No. I just haven't. I'm interested, it's interesting, but... I just haven't.\" Dr. B.: \"Have you seen the cover pict ures on Whitley Streiber's book, with the being with the large head, and the dark eyes? Dark slanty eyes?\" L.: \"Yeah, it sounds familiar. I don't remember seeing any pictures of it.\" J.: \"As we talk about it now, does anything happen inside? Any sensations? Any flutters?\" L.: \"Mmm. My chest feels heav y, right here. Umm. Like it's weighted. Like it's heavy.\" Dr. B.: \"If you could focus in on that heaviness wh ere it's weighted right there, what image comes?\" L.: \"Bright light.\" Dr. B.: \"Focus on that bri ght light and listen. Is th ere a sound? In that heavi- ness in your chest?\" L.: \"A pounding. There's a pounding... far off pounding.\" Dr. B.: \"Keep listening, keep watching. What happens next?\" L.: \"It's a bright room. And it's light. A lot of light. It's... It's like a surgical room. Like, uh... tile all around, like, I don't know, white walls, white everywhere, white everywhere, white everywhere. Light.\" Dr. B.: \"Sterile, like a surgery room, white.\" L.: \"Yes. Lights everywhere. Light, just light. Light.\" Dr. B.: \"Equipment in this surgery room?\" L.: \"Far off. I can't... I have a sense of it, but I can't see it 'cause it's so bright. Dr. B.: \"Mmm. (pause) What's happening in this room?\" L.: \"It feels like I'm on something cold, and I can't move.\" Dr. B.: \"Sitting, lying down?\" L.: \"I'm lying down, I'm on my back.\" Dr. B.: \"So you're facing upward, you can see the light?\" L.: \"It's bright all around, (pause) And there's things, people, something moving around, but I can't see 'cause it's so bright. And I can't move.\" Laura's voice was rising in p itch, indicating some anxiety. Dr. B.: \"And you can sense their presence?\" L.: \"Something, yes.\" Dr. B.: \"Even in the bright ness, can you get a sense of their shapes as they move around?\" 60"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind L.: \"No. I can't... This isn't really...\" The tone of her voice was expressing her incredulity at what she was experi- encing and describing. Dr. B.: (gently) \"Trust what comes.\" L.: \"There's these things, moving a ll around and they have... And I can't move. And they have... arms, something, they can reach.\" Laura let out a little troubled sigh. Dr. B.: \"What?\" L.: \"Something's petting my forehead.\" Dr. B.: \"Is it comforting, or something else?\" L.: \"No. It wants to be comforting, but it feels weird. It feels cold and hard and clammy, like, someone's petting me w ith a sweaty hand, except for it's cold.\" Dr. B.: \"Yes. They're trying to be comforting.\" L.:\"Yes.\" J.: \"What age is Laura as she lies here and she's being petted?\" L.: \"Thirteen.\" J.: \"Go on. What happens. The petting on the forehead.\" L.: \"Yes. Umm. I think they come up and... They're poking me.\" Dr. B.: \"Poking you?\" L.: \"Just like reaching out and poking me like I'm some kind of something that feels weird. Like I'm something new to poke and touch, and see how it feels. I feel like a bug! Like they're curious. Th ey run up and poke, like on my arms and then they run away. Like it's a funny thing for them to do, too. I don't feel afraid. But it's weird. And it's very bright. It's just bright light all around. And I can't really see anything, just sort of images, and I know that they're there.\" J.: \"Any other humans in that bright place with you?\" L.: \"No, just these things around.\" Dr. B.: \"The brightness, the light, is it coming from lights or lamps or bulbs, can you tell?\" L.: \"It seems like it is, fr om around the edges of th e room and over my body and around the thing I'm laying on.\" Laura was highly hypnotizable, and, I suspected, highly suggestible. The questions about the light bulbs, lamps, an d equipment in the room were meant to test her suggestibility. We had briefly questioned her about her knowledge of UFOs, the literature on abducti ons, and the pictures of aliens to determine if she had any background information or preconceive d notions of the subject. Apparently, she didn't. Experiencers don't report lamps or bulbs. J.: \"What's on your body?\" L.: \"Nothing.\" This realization disturbed Laura. She was uncovered and these things were treating her like some kind of lab specimen. Dr. B.: \"Are they still touching, poking you?\" L.: \"No. They're busy, doing things, someth ing. Off there they each have their little tasks to do. Whatever that is. I can't tell. I can't move.\" 61"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"CEVI Laura took a quick breath and let out a quick sigh.

She sometimes walked the path th rough the field. On this hot summer day she noticed it suddenly became windy. Not a normal wi nd, but a swirling wi nd, kicking up dust. Like a little \"dust devil,\" she said. Kicking up dirt around her feet. Bigger than a dust devil. It came up from behind her and she had to turn around to look and she saw how weird it was. Dr. B.: \"What happens next?\" L.:\"Ohh...This is...\" Dr. B.: \"Trust what comes. Trust the images that come.\" L.: It's hot. I'm really hot. And there' s this... really bright light around me.

Laura was walking slowly along a curv ed hallway with her hands out. She was numb and coul dn't feel anything, though she was aware of hands on her back urging her along. Someone was holding her wr ists, and their touch felt hard. She suddenly gasped. They were taking her into a room. It was very bright and they put her on the cold table. Sh e couldn't move. Somethin g like people were moving around the room, doing things. Something started petting her forehead. In this very bright room, a door opened. Laura could just move her eyes enough to see the darkness in the area where the door opened. The surfaces of the room emanated light. The walls were light so that everything was bright with no shadows. There were no bulbs or fixtures of any kind. He r mind did not accept my earlier suggestion about light fixtures in the room. The door closed and it was light again. A being walked into the room. He app eared larger than the others, and the smaller beings deferred to him; he was clearly in charge. He was carrying some- thing she could not identify. She thought of him as the \"doctor.\" He stood on the left side of the table. The one petting her forehead stepped back but kept its hands lightly touching the sides of Laura's head. Dr. B.: \"What happens next?\" L.: \"He's putting something in my mouth. He's using some kind of tool or something. Got my mouth open. Like the den tist, he's using some kind of tool. I can't feel anything, but he's pushing me with it. I can feel him like, prodding me, or nushing me, or poking me, or doing somethi ng in there. Feels like I'm getting a filling.\" Dr. B.: \"It reminds you of a dentist putting a filling in your tooth.

He's putting something up further in my 63"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"CEVI jaw. In the bone, up inside.\" Laura had experienced and was describing the placement of an implant in the bone near her left ear, through her mouth. It was a typical abduction scene: the flash of light; unconsciousness; a feeling of numbness as the beings escorted her along a curved hallway; the br ightly lit room with the cold table; the smaller beings preparing her and perhaps anesthetizing her; the \"doctor\" implanting the device. Her memory was blank from the moment of the little whir lwind that kicked up the dust and the bright, hot light until the moment she looked up and the little boys asked: \"Hey lady, are you OK?\" She continued on to her doctor's office where she had been scheduled at 1:00 PM. She arrived at nearly 5 o'clock. She called home. Her sister scolded her, her mother was angry and drove to the office. Laura could not account for the lost time, and no one believed her. They put her on an examining table and brought a bright light down toward her. She fell off the table onto the floor and nearly passed out. Then she vomited. The doctor thought she'd had a mild heat stroke. Her mother thought she was weak and dizzy from not eating. In the SRT Training, we teach the pro cess of remote spirit releasement, communicating with other bei ngs at a distance. We suggested to Laura the possi- bility of speaking with the \"doctor\" in the surgery ro om through her voice mecha- nism channeling his words. We had never a ttempted this before, in fact, it was our first abduction case. We didn't know what could be done about the implant now, but we wanted to find out. It didn't belong in Laura's skull. She agreed to try the remote process. Laura quickly located the moment when the doctor entered the room and stood beside her left shoulder. She did not express fear this time. Dr. B.: \"Can you see his face at all? Can you see his eyes?\" L.: \"Yes, they're big, they're big... They almost look human, but they don't have any color. They're black, there's no white.\" Dr. B.: \"Set across from each other like human eyes? L.:\"Yes.\" Dr. B.: \"What shape is each eye?\" L.: \"Like almonds.\" Dr. B.: \"What color is his skin, can you tell?\" L.: \"It's flesh color, but like wax.\" Dr. B.: \"I'm going to direct these que stions at him.\" (more firmly) \"To you, Doctor, you've done this before, haven't y ou? With humans?\" (more softly) \"What does he say?\" L.: \"Yes.\" Her voice was softer, steadier, flat. Dr. B.: \"How many humans, Doctor, have you placed such devices in?\" L.: \"Thousands.\" Dr. B.: \"For what purpose?\" L.: \"Information, to hear, to listen, to track.\" Information was gathered, studied and st ored. This was his job, none other. He knew no more than this about the ope ration. He only did this one procedure. 64"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind The doctor only did this procedure on pe ople. This sounded like a recording on a telephone answering machine. I asked if we were in contact with the doctor. The answer was no, it was a recording. I request ed the presence of the doctor. After about 30 seconds, Laura spoke with a softer voice; someone else had come on line. This one had a bit more information. Yes, he replied, this was his job, and he did not concern himself with the information after it was gathered. Another worker sent the information to a com- mand station. The doctor stated that hundr eds of substations, as he called his craft, were above the earth, over every country, every human population site. People were transformed by light particle, on a molecula r level, and transported to the craft. There they were reintegrated into physical form, implanted, then returned to their previous location in the same way. Yes, it was the physical body that was taken in this manner. This group only dealt with the pubescent humans. This group did not place the implants in nose or sinus. They perfor med only this procedure after which they would monitor to gather information. That was their purpose , their job, and the doctor did not need to know, nor was he concerned with, any other level of the work or any higher purpose. We asked the doctor to connect with the higher level command station, but there was no response from that level. Th at link was apparently blocked to us. We requested that this procedure which had violated so many humans be stopped. Surprisingly, the doctor agreed, he saw that it was a violation of free will, though he had not considered such before this moment. He agreed to deactivate the device impl anted in Laura from where he was. He could remove the device only if she were brought aboard the craft again. That decision was left for her to make at an other time. We could do no more in that session. Laura disconnected from the doctor and the scene. She visualized her body filled with light, and came fully into present moment co nsciousness, full y in control of her own body and mind. The session was complete. 89 Abduction and Transformation Dr. John Mack, Harvard psyc hiatrist and author of Abduction, writes about 13 cases of alien abduction in which the typical intrusive procedures were conducted. There was the pain, the trauma, the extracted fetuses, similar to other reported cases. And yet some of his patients eventually experienced a spiritual transformation as the result of the abduction experience. 90 This notion of potential spiritual transformation has begun to surface in some abduction reports. If there exists any possibility of a higher purpose in this purported alien invasion of our sovereignty, we must ma intain our receptivity to new ideas and concepts of the possible evol ution of human consciousness . Enmeshed in the terror and pain of the trauma, most people have seen the alien presence and activity as intrusion and personal violatio n. Few people have looked beyond the victimization to seek anything of value. 65"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"CEVI Is there truly some redeeming value in the experiences, or is there some subtle influence dist orting the perceptions and interpretations of the experiencers? Is it real, or is it mind control? Some inve stigators firmly belie ve that the \"alien abduction\" scenes are implanted in the human subconscious and become screen memories or cover memories, concealing the memory of actual experiences of mind control experimentation by human scientists. These accusatory speculations are often aimed at CIA covert operations. By definition, a screen me mory, or cover memory is a re al memory or thought, not a fantasized one, which is used as a shield to conceal an allied memory which might be too pain ful or emotionally unacceptable. 91 If such im- planted memories include not only the images, but also the psychological and physical components, that is a truly amazi ng feat of hypnosis , thought projection, or electromagnetic radiation. One investigator, who claims to have connections with upper level govern- ment and military sources in several countries, suggests that the forcible, painful, intrusive alien abductions are indeed connected wi th human agencies. He speculates that contacts with alien beings who advise caution for the human race, produce healing for the contactee, and inspire spiritually transformative experiences are just what they seem to be . Perhaps the true picture is more vast and complex than an yone could imagine. Recently, there have been reports of a number of experiencers of traumatic abductions who have suddenly changed their attitude toward the abductors and the entire abduction experience. They now repo rt spiritual growth and transformation. There is no explanation for this abrupt shif t. It's as if there were a time-release signal going off in their mind, suddenly ac tivating this response. While they may describe logical justification for th e change, it remains a mystery to many observers. There is certainly a parallel between the intrusive alien activity and the behav- ior of the classic forces of darkness, Lu cifer and his legions of demons, which were cast into earth and continue to plague humans. 92 The hallmarks are not identical but they are similar: intrusion without permi ssion; violation without regard for physical and mental suffering; taking control with absolutely no re gard for personal sovereignty and freedom. However, when we find th e ETs under the influence of the dark force entities, there is no doubt about the differentiation between ETs and DFEs. Drawing from the narratives of thousands of clients in altered states, it seems the legions of demons under the command of Lucifer were scattered far and wide in the universe and not confined to the planet earth. Th ese dark beings plague other life forms with the same intrusiveness, arrogance, and disregard for personal integrity that they impose on human beings. They cause as much disruption, chaos, confusion, and destruction, and make the same promises of wealth, power, control, and domination. And beings all over the unive rse have believed and accepted these false promises, and have suffered the consequences. 66"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind C h a p t e r 5 THE HYBRIDS The Human/Alien Hybrid A terribly disturbing element of th e UFO abduction phenomenon is the reported genetic experimentation and breeding program. 93 Many women recall being probed through the abdomen and the vagina, apparently for the purpose of extracting eggs. Men have recalled being stim ulated to ejaculation by various means, from suction tubes to forced intercourse with human females and alien beings which appeared to be \"female.\" A few men have re ported being seduced or even forced into sexual intercourse with what first appear ed to be a human fe male, then seeing it change into something defi nitely alien and repulsive. People have reported this sexual aggressiveness by shape shifters in their own bedrooms. Many women have been diag nosed as being pregnant onl y to suddenly find, at about 10 to 12 weeks in the gestation peri od, that they are no longer pregnant. This happens without pain, bleeding or discha rge of any kind. Th e pregnancy simply disappears. Some of the women who report th is situation claim they have not been with a man. This mysterious pregnant/not pregnant situation has been going on for many years. 94 Some female experiences also recall under hypnosis the \"incubatoriums\" which contain glass containers filled with fluid. In this fluid, they see what appear to be floating embryos, not quite human, connected to wires and tubes. There are also nurseries in which women are shown, a nd urged to touch, and even hug, small children who appear to be from 2 to 5 or 6 years old. These children are slender with large heads and eyes, not alien, not quite huma n. They are described as listless, frail, and they do respond to the human touch. Th e aliens who manage these nurseries don't seem to be able to nurture the children. These children are the hybrids, the result of the genetic manipulation which some people say is part of our own planet ary, galactic, even spiritual evolution. 95 This provokes some alarming speculations. Is th is the next \"missing link\" in human evolution? Have aliens manipulated our ge netic code in ancient times? Is it possible humans were seeded from some other extr aterrestrial civilization millions of years ago? Is the abduction phenomenon, which is being reported around the world, part of human evolution an d transformation of consciousness? 96 Or, will the human race be bred out of existence in the future as the \"perfect\" hybrid is developed? Is it possible that alien sexual encounters gave rise to the pre-Christian belief in the incubus and succubus, th e demons which were thought to forcibly engage in sex with humans? They were accused of raping women and extracting sperm from men. In early theology, people believed th at children could issue from such a 67"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"CEVI union, though this belief was late r discarded from Church doctrine. 97 Such was the theme of movies like Damien and Rosemary's Baby. As with any experiments in volving biological material , some of these geneti- cally engineered children survive, some do not. What happens to the \"soul\" of a non-physical or quasi-physi cal being when it separates from its quasi-physical form? Which Light does it go to, the gol den-white of our own reincarnational cycle, or the blue or green of the homew orld of the alien experimenters? Many of them don't find their way home at all, but attach to living humans. When we find the entities of the faile d hybrid children, they are usually in small groups, banded together in fear, isolation, and confusion. They suffer the same emotions of half-breeds throughout human history. They fear being rejected by both sides of their ancestry, much like the offspring of th e Caucasian and the Native American in the early days of this country, the whites and blacks, the American soldier and the Vietnamese women during an d after the Vietnam War. The half breed has been the target of hatred, prejudice, rejection, and the scapegoat of human projection for a long time. Like any other earthbound entity, they maintain the pe rsonality characteristics of the half breed, the human/alien hybrid they were when they were \"alive.\" They perceive themselves as that. Beings of Light are universally equal, whole and complete, intact and without blemish. Taki ng on the frailties of personality imbues a being with emotions such as fear, pr econceived notions of prejudice, and confu- sion. Even as attached spirit entities, they seem frail, vulnerable , and timid in the perception of the client who discovers them. They hesitate to project their thoughts so the client can repeat their words aloud. In session, these beings must be treated very gently. We call on the Light for all the help we can get to escort them home. They express their doubts ab out being accepted into the golden-white Light. However, when they perceive the angelic beings coming toward them and extending the energy of love, they react w ith joy. They are happy to be accepted in the Light. The Alien/Alien Hybrid After reading several books detailing th e human/alien hybrid situation, it was no surprise to find the entities of the failed hybrid children. 98 Then we began to find something else. What the clients desc ribed just didn't fit with what we had read about hybrids. Th e alien/alien hybrid was a startling discovery. In one case, the \"parents\" were from quite disparate groups: the White (not Caucasian) ET beings were reported to be refined, spiritually evolved and benevo- lent; the Greyish ET beings (not typical Gr eys) were coarse, not at all evolved, and rather boorish, if not brutish. The hybrid offs pring of this pairing were transparent, of a higher vibration and invisible to the Greyish aliens, yet rejected by the Whites. Like the leper, they had no place to go. In session, we sometimes improvise. Whet her it is pure fantasy or inspired imagination, it often works for the client. Judith sensed that there was a place of 68"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind light and love for these discarded beings and she called out to the Guardian of Light from that place. After she did this the client perceived the Guardian as it approached. The little ones soon trusted the Guardian of Light as it gladly em- braced the alien/alien hybrids with love an d took them home to their own place in the Light. We can be sure that nothing is as simple as it seems at first presentation. The initial reports of hybrid children were s hocking to people. Now there are T-shirts with drawings of cute little hybrid children available at any UFO conference. Many people seem to have grown immune to the implications behind the phenomenon. The sight of these frail looking children tugs at the heartstrings like the big- eyed children in Walter Kean e paintings which were popular some years ago. Few people are unmoved by the plight of child ren in our world today; so many are hungry, abused, parentless. The open hearted acceptance of these hybrid children may blunt our caution toward those who ar e responsible for their production and dull the memory of all that led up to this point in their project. If these experiences reflect a true real ity and such hybrids are introduced into human civilization, what will become of them? Will they be rejected as other human/human hybrids have been in our history? Will hum an beings accept them and make them part of the fabric of humanki nd? These difficult questions may confront us sooner than we expect. 69"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"CEV1 C hapter 6 CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE POSSESSION KIND The different types of close encounters with aliens have been designated by Roman numeral.\" CE-I, Nearby UFO sightings. CE-II, physical and mental affects on people, strange and unusual markings on the ground, and purported physical artifacts of alien spacecraft. CE-III, visual contact with alien beings. CE-IV, uninvited, for ceful alien abductions. CE-V, intentional invitation to alien contact (as developed by the CSETI group 100 ). 101 I am proposing CE-VI as the designation for the condition we have found so frequently in altered state sessions with clients: intrusion and parasitic attachment by non-human beings from another place, the alien beings or ETs. Historically, this condition is termed possession. In these cases, the possessing entity is not a de- mon, but an otherworldly or other-dimensional being. There is a popular romantic notion, perhaps more frantic than romantic, that friendly ETs, our \"space brothers,\" are poised to assist us, or have been poised for some time, just waiting for the call. Bump er stickers read: \"Beam me up Scotty.\" In the popular movie, Independence Day, crowds stood on the roofs of tall build- ings holding signs pleading and inviti ng: \"TAKE ME HOME ,\" \"WELCOME TO EARTH,\" \"TAKE ME WITH YOU, \" \"HELLO BROTHER,\" \"REMEMBER ME,\" and other such greetings and pleas. Many people call out for a visitation by ex traterrestrials, our \"cousins\" from other planetary neighborhoods. The motivati on may be curiosity or a genuine call for help for this disintegrating civilizati on. The ETs may come at the call, and the person calling had better have something impor tant to say. The extraterrestrials are serious and have their own missions to accomplish. The call for help can be inter- preted as permission to interact with th e human being in the form of abduction or attachment. This attachment can be enor mously destructive for the hapless host/ victim. Some people have invited \"space brothers\" to channel through them, to use their voice mechanism for disseminating words of wisdom. An opportunistic discarnate spirit, astral entity, or nearby alien can take advantage of anyone offer- ing such an open invitation. Channeling or mediumship is defined as a temporary possession by another being, with permission of the host, for a specified purpose and limited duration. In many cases of channeling, the being coming in and speak- ing through the voice of the willing human re fuses to leave at the end of the chan- neling session. This becomes a permanent spirit possession or attachment by an extraterrestrial, an alien being. 70"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind It seems that these non-p hysical aliens ha ve somehow infiltr ated the subcon- scious minds of a great num ber of people, with or w ithout invitation. Reportedly, the beings can telepathically project words, exert mental control, even produce physical and emotional comfort during an abdu ction. It is possible the aliens project all the emotions a person is feeling, even the images and experiences of an abduction. Most of our clients in clinical se ssion are willing to speak the words or thoughts that just pop up in response to our questions, whatever that might be. They describe any physical sensations that emerge during our dialogue. We en- courage them to trust what comes to mind and express it right out loud. During therapy sessions, we have spoken with the alter personalities in people diagnosed with DID, or dissociative identity disorder (formerly termed MPD, or multiple personality disorder). 102 There is usually an al ter who knows which ones among them are created within the persona lity system, which ones are past life personalities \"awakened\" due to a traumatic event, and which are invited from outside, that is, attached entities of various types. Clients without any sign of DID (M PD) also uncover other personalities which are decidedly not their own. Thes e others speak through the voice of the client. We have conversed with personalities who claim to be other people, some dead, some alive. These entities are the att ached souls or soul fragments of human beings. For the client who seeks assistance for personal, emotional, physical, and sometimes spiritual problems, it is an unpleasant surprise to discover that an earthbound human entity is causing the prob lem. It can leave a person feeling helpless and unable to protect themselves from such violation of personal bound- aries. Yet for most people, the concept of a spirit world where su ch things happen is at least familiar. This is a popular them e in fiction, both in books and movies. In the movie, Maxie, Glenn Close plays a young wife who is invaded by the spirit of an actress who had lived in thei r San Francisco apartment decades before. When she realizes the situation, she de livers a great line: \"I'm a woman, not a flophouse!\" In therapy sessions, we have been challe nged by beings whic h claim to be the minions of Lucifer. (They don't call th emselves demons, that is a designation imposed by people.) This often causes disb elief and rejection in people who refuse to accept the existence of demons and a devil. It can cause fear in people who believe in the religious notions a bout the existence of such beings. The most common r eaction for clients who discover a resident ET is incredu- lity. It is such a foreign notion. However, the client has no doubt what it is after a few minutes of exploring and questioning. Because most people carry two, some- times all three main types of entities, the client can easily tell the difference be- tween the different types that are present. Most people are totally un aware of any such presence before a session. In some cases, a person knows something is not right, either emotionally or physi- cally, and it's somehow indescribable. As the other being an swers the discovery 71"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"CEVI questions, the client hears the narrative in their own voice. This is not an account of their own experience; it is obviously so meone or something else describing something quite different. Howeve r, it involves thei r body and mind. It is clear to them after hearing (and speaking) this dialogue that they have been invaded by an alien consciousness, an extraterrestrial. It is distressing, it is unbelievable, it does not fit into any preconceived notions of reality. And yet, here it is, in their own thoughts, in their own words, and in their own experience. Through the voices of our clients, we ha ve encountered aliens who claim to be from far away, from other worlds. They describe several different missions, functions, or purposes for being here: they are the colonists, expansionists, scien- tists, hybrids, conquerors, and worse. The majority of our clients in an alte red state of consciousness discover these other personalities, other beings or entities, other voices, when they explore the farther reaches of the subconscious levels of their own mi nds. Some of these others are friendly, even helpful, others are neutral, still others are opportunistic and are using the energy and resources of the host, while others are hostile and downright harmful. All th ese parasitic intruders exact a cost from the host. At the present time, more than half of our clients discover attached ETs during sessions, and other therapists who use SRT techniques also discover such intruders. The extraterrestrials describe various reasons for being here, but most have no compunction about the invasion, no hesitation regarding the violation of the free will of the affected human. Basically, ther e is no concern fo r our individual sovereignty as a sentient species. These intruders may be lost, marooned or retired here on the earth. Some claim to be using the eyes and ears of th e human as they themselves do not have the proper apparatus to perceive this reality, dimension, or plane. They assert that they cannot interpret the band of the el ectromagnetic spectrum which we see as color, nor can they interpret sound waves. Some of the ETs declare they are here on scientific expeditions, much as human scientists explore the jungles, oceans, and remote places on this globe. Normally, the attached ET s are not hostile nor aggr essive when discovered, nor are they threatening. They are intrusive, secretive, and do not like to be dis- turbed in their work. When questioned, they will speak and they don't hesitate to disclose their purpose for being with the client. They don't think there is anything we can do to disturb them or interfere with their activity. Many of the attached ETs claim that they have been with the client not only since early childhood, but also in former lifetimes here on earth. In a few cases, they claim they came from the same homeworld as the client and that they were friends, family, or colleagu es there. These co nnections go back a long time! A few clients hesitate to get rid of a bei ng with such an intertwined history. Some aliens, through the voice of the client in altered state, assert flatly that they are taking over the world in this ma nner. They plan to simply suppress the human will, control human bodies and take up residence here in these physical biological vehicles. Further probing reveals the dark force entities, or DFEs, 72"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind influencing or controlling these ETs. This aggressive, invasive, overpowering behavior is an almost universal sign of DFE infestation. In some cases, the intrusive ETs claim to be operating under the spiritual principle of Universal Oneness, and since they are part of the One, and humans are also part of the One, they are not interf ering with someone else, only exploring the larger dimensions of the One Self. This is a distortion of spiritual principles in the pursuit of selfish and intrusive goals. There may be many in telligent species in the universe. If we accept the possi- bility that the information coming through the consciousness and voice of our clients is valid, then we may assume that a great number of extraterrestrials are already here among our population. And ma ny of them are inte rfering with living humans in much the same way that discarnate EBs and DFEs disrupt the normal course of human life. Many folks have a strange \"save me\" attitude toward supposed higher beings from other places. An invitation to an ET group may bring visitors, yet if they haven't saved humanity before this, why w ould they do it now? An invitation to the \"space brothers\" may bring in the dark ETs , and that would be the beginning of a bondage that could last a long time. SRT techniques are gentle though firm. Each type of attached being is guided to make the choice to leave and cease inte rfering with the human host. The client learns to recognize and heal the vulnerab ility, secure the opening, and rescind the invitation that allowed the attachment, in the present life or during some other existence. It is not unusual to find that the client, very curious at some time in their life, actually called out for someone from the skies to come to them. The response can be a big surprise! Even when a human being does not inv ite the aliens, they come anyway from somewhere \"out there.\" These are the lost ones, the colonists and invaders, the scientists, or the ETs who are controlled by the DFEs. On the li ghter side, some of those who come may be teache rs, even some aspect of ou rselves from some future time or alternate dimension, or they may be entering the fabric of our time-space continuum to bring us hope for our future. Whether or not the narratives are valid, a degree of emotional and sometimes physical healing occurs with most of our c lients as a result of regression therapy, recovery of soul fragmentation, spirit releasement therapy, and ET releasement therapy. As a therapist, this is my first goa l. As an investigator, I continue to be enormously curious. Yet there is no way to prove or disprove these situations. However, the consistency of such narratives from many hundreds of clients seems to indicate a real and widespread condition which warrants further serious, unbiased investigation. Self Protection With awareness and understanding, the clie nt can learn to pay attention to the signs of approaching intruders. A person can learn to say \"NO!\" to an opportunistic entity. This certainly helps restore the feeling of personal power and the ability 73"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"CEVI to protect oneself. This has been suggested in several recent books. 103 Some experiencers claim they have been able to interrupt and stop an abduction by various strategies including: reciting the Lord's Prayer; feeling and expressing righteous anger; visualizing a fountain of light pouring from their body; extending the energy of love rather than fear. The approaching ETs se em to hesitate, then just fadeaway! 74"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"C hapter 7 THE ALIEN COLONISTS In clinical sessions, we listen and wr ite down the information that emerges from clients in altered states of consci ousness. The narratives describe the aliens, their stated purposes for being here, methods of operation, and eventual goals. Other therapists around the country are di scovering similar info rmation. There is a disturbing consistency in these reports, independently gathered, that supports the validity of the experience. This is what we have discovered. Some alien groups seem to be intent on expanding their reach in the universe and establishing colonial outposts on other planets. This is certainly not a new idea; colonialism has a long and painful history right here on earth. These groups are usually under the influe nce of the DFEs. The SRT techniques are very effective in releasing these intruders. These invasive ETs choose to make use of the living bodies of the human inhabitants of earth. It is convenient for them to simply infiltrate the minds of people and take control. This is not unlik e the theme of the movie of some years ago entitled, Invasion of the Body Snatchers. They are bent on taking over by estab lishing \"squatter's rights\" with men, women, and children on this planet. They may or may not be hostile when discov- ered. They are arrogant and certain of their superiority. They are here and there is nothing we can do about it. Or so they boast. When none of the basic SRT techniques seem to be working quickly enough, I appeal to their recollection of their own history. I do a brief past life regression on an alien attached to the mind and body of my client. They are receptive and cooperative in this activity because they think nothing will be able to get rid of them. Here is an example of such an interaction. I take clear notes regarding which voice is the client's and which voices are the other's. Dr. B.: \"Recall, in the history of your own homeworld, a time of invasion by a superior species. Someone from anothe r place. Consult your computer, your libraries, the memories of your wise ones. (I use anything that pops into my mind at this point.) Recall another time when your own people were taken over by someone else. Locate such an event. What happened?\" There is usually some hesitation at this point as the process begins. The instructions \"Recall\" and \"Locate\" ar e powerful commands to the subconscious mind. It actually stops them for a moment. And they rememb er such an invasion! Is it real? Am I insp ired in those moments by some higher aspect of consciousness to ask for such a memory? Am I also in an al tered state to the degree that I tap into the ET's own memory banks? Or is it ju st suggestion and imagination, mine and the client's? I just know it works; there is nearly always a response, and the 75 Close Encounters of the Possession Kind"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"CEVI process goes to completion, that is, the \"others\" leave and the client feels better. Through the client's voice, they will begi n revealing the story of an ancient time when just such an invasion occurred. I continue to probe. I ask what hap- pened, how their people reac ted to the unwanted, uninvi ted intrusion, and what they did to defend themselves. And they tell me! They give me the solution to the present situation! And then they agree to leave! Dr. B.: \"Now you know ho w we feel about your i nvasion here. Compare your reactions and feelings to our own as you come here uninvited. Can you understand our resistance to your intrusion?\" Deep down, they must ha ve a sense of decency, justice, goodness, and equal- ity, because this approach has worked time and time again. They agree to separate from the client and to call on all others of their kind interfe ring with other humans at this time. They agree to leave together, and another horde of invaders is sent packing. Dual Identity—Human/Alien A few attached ETs clai m to be hiding, lost, abandoned or retired. 104 They either came here to escape punishment for so me crime or error, or just veered off course during a voyage and found earth by sheer chance. Some have been left behind by their commander as punishment for some infraction aboard ship, others describe earth as a retirement home. In a few cases, the alien is no longer with its own body, having made the transition which parallel s human death. Like many earthbound spirits who don't know they are dead, the ET does not know it has \"died.\" Many of the aliens acknowledge the intr usion, but claim they have nowhere else to go. Some claim to be from a homeworld which no longer exists, having been incinerated or destroyed by some force. These planets were either annihilated by natural events, or by the insanity of war. These are not past life memories of the client recalling an alien existence, but concurrent experiences: present life of human and present experience of ET. The ET can describe the homeworld and what happened to it, the journey here (we can't seem to get a clear picture of th e technology of propulsion, mechanism of translation, or mode of travel), the ar rival on planet Earth, and the process of locating and attaching to the client. This sort of ET attachment may at first appear as a \"dual identity,\" a human/ alien blending. 105 The person may have the entir e memory of th e current human lifetime, and also the expe rience of being an alien w ith knowledge of its own people, memory of the homeworld, the spacecraft and its recent activities aboard. 106 In cases of suspected du al identity, the attached ET can be discovered and identified with specific qu estions by the therapist. In some cases, the human and the ET ha ve developed a friendly, even loving interaction. This may be the true nature of the connection. However, we have seen that the aliens can induce feelings of l ove and comfort in the human abductee or contactee. 107 In many more cases th at we have seen in cl inical practice, the ETs 76"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind care not one whit for the welfare of the human. They have a purpose and they diligently pursue that purpose, manipulati ng the human host to serve that purpose. The attached alien assumes the host's body as its own body. At least it has assumed ownership and control. It simply ignores the human spirit and denies any notion of invasion or interference. After all, the ET considers itself superior to these humans; much as on Earth, the superior species has no concern over what is done to the inferior. Specific questions uncover the connection between an attached entity and host, in this cas e the alien and the human, and exposes the illusion of \"dual identity.\" Dr. B.: \"Recall the experience of joining this body, (pause) Is there already someone there? Is the rightful spirit already in the body?\" The answer is always a surprised \"Yes.\" If it were actually the rightf ul spirit speaking, this question would be meaning- less. The attached being, whatever type, is clear at this point that it is the intruder. Dr. B.: \"How old was this person when you joined them?\" The answer is given as an age in years, usually very young, often at the time ofbirth. Dr. B.: \"Where were you before you joined this person?\" The true contracted spirit was in the golden-white Light prior to conception and gestation. An attached ET describes be ing on the craft or the mother ship, or in a place of different colored light. Dr. B.: \"Who sent you here? Who assigned you to this body?\" The commandant of the mother ship , knowledgeable about human customs and behaviors, assigned the ET to the hum an host, usually at the time ofbirth, knowing this would be the least conspicuous intrusion. From another perspective, this might be considered a compassionate, even heroic act by the commandant, in an attempt to help his peop le survive a desperate situa tion by using living humans as receptacles for ET consciousness. From the viewpoint of the human host, it is nothing but an attempted possession by a non-physical consciousness, an alien being. This is a violation, and something can and must be done to terminate the invasion. Most people are not aware of such attachments since any effects or outward signs would be present from birth. Family members would consider any unusual behavior as normal for the person for the same reason. Only in an altered state therapy session would such an attached en tity be discovered. It is often quite a surprise for the client to discover the pr esence of an alien being cohabiting within their physical body and subconsci ous mind in such a connection. As with any other attaching entity, th e conscious thoughts and memories of the ET and human seem to merge at the time of attachment. Thus the human may have knowledge and memory of the craft, the alien race, and their homeworld. He or she also has the normal memories of a human growing up in this culture. Having been so closely intertwined for an entire lifetime, the human of ten feels emotionally connected, even dependent on the attached alien. For the client it is sometimes a 77"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"CEVI difficult and wrenching decision to finally release the attached ET. In her book, Encounters, psychologist Edith Fiore, Ph.D. describes a case of an attachment by an ET. 108 Her client, a man in his mid 40's, was a little boy at the time of the attachment, walking along a di rt road in Washington state. The non- physical alien swooped down toward eart h, discovered the boy, and simply came into the back of his head. The boy was unaware of the in trusion. It seems the alien came to earth, as had many others of its kind, as a retirement sanctuary. He ran- domly chose this boy as his resting place, his nest. In altered state, the client descri bed his own life and his own memories, before and after the time of the attachment. He also described, in first person as if he were actually there, the interior of the alien's craft, a well armed battle cruiser, their voyages and battle engagements, and his eventual retirement from active duty. This was not a case of dual identity, it was another separate, individual consciousness which ha d attached to the subconscious mind and body of this child. The alien expressed his longing to retu rn to duty with his old crew. The narrative of his adventures was a shocking revelation. It seems the alien group would discover a planet they wanted, th en make a \"drop\" on a major inhabited area. This meant inflicting total devastati on on a city or primary population center. They would then contact the leaders or rulers and declare they were taking over the planet. Any objections? If there was any resistance, the aliens would launch another \"drop.\" End of objections; no mo re resistance; take over the planet. In the popular movie, Independence Day, a similar plot unfolded. The super weapon aboard the alien craft laid waste to vast areas of several major cities and other locations. World military strength was decimated. Through the swift thinking and brave efforts of a few good people, th e aliens were destroyed and the earth was saved. Certainly this is one way to unite the peoples of Earth! A common enemy. Even former President Reagan suggested this in a speech during his second term. Though stories of alien life are fascinating, we aren't primarily focused on the circumstances of the aliens, or details of the ship, we are intent on releasing these intruders from their host. These things are not fun, and they can wreak havoc in a human life. In several cases, we discovered that the ET could take control of the con- sciousness to the point that the client 's voice produced unintelligible sounds. Obviously this was some kind of language , with inflections, repeated sound pat- terns and recognizable pauses and shifts for sentence structure or questions, but it sounded like total gibberish to the human ear. In the process of any Releasement Therapy, there must be meaningful conve rsation between the therapist and the attached entity. In a few cases , the alien did not leave. In one such case, the family of the client had actually grown fond of the being who was cohabiting in their daughter's body, and had actually learned th e meaning of some of its phrases. With that kind of permission and acceptance, th ere was no way we could convince it to leave. For those few aliens who seem to ha ve no connection with a nearby craft or 78"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind crew, but are genuinely lost or marooned, or deceased, we call on the Rescue Spirits of Light from the ( color ) light universe, using the color they have de- scribed to us. It works! The attached ET recognizes and describes the colorful beings who come to help it on the journey home. As they leave, they are offered one last chance to speak their farewells to th e host they are leaving. It is usually an apology for the intrusion, the confusion, and a sincere \"Thank you\" for the assis- tance in finding their way home. In his book, Abductions, Dr. John Mack describes several cases of \"dual identity,\" that is, a blende d human/alien consciousness in which a client has her/his own memories and yet can describe the in terior of the craft, the meaning and purpose of the mission and details of alien life. Mack interprets this phenomenon as a higher level of consciousness becoming known to a lower (human) aspect. Some clients have a feeling of being a bridge between the two realms, human and alien. The therapist with a broad awareness of the spiritual reality and a working knowledge of the concepts of SRT would suggest a differe nt explanation. This is not dual identity, but attachment and a ttempted possession of living humans by alien beings. Unfortunately, th is situation is quite common. Perhaps there is a higher purpose in the forcible abductions and the trauma that many abductees experience. Though se veral of Dr. Mack's clients claim to have been elevated spiritually by the experience, most people who endure the involuntary seizure, experimentation, and sexual violation would not agree. 109 Some experiencers have indeed enjoyed a person al expansion and what might be called spiritual transformati on following alien abduction, though it typically takes many months for this awareness to develop. 110 Some of Dr. Mack's client s feel they have eventually benefited from the traumatic experience. Howeve r for the vast majority of people who have recalled and reported their abduction experience, there is resentment, fear of the return of the aliens, and the feeling of repugna nce at having been so violated. When our clients discover a resident alien, regardless of any stated purpose for it being here, whether as a colonist wh ose world no longer exists, as a scientist gathering data, or as a conqueror attempting to take over humanity person by person, the reaction is to get rid of the in truder. This is a para sitic condition, which always exacts a mental or physical toll from the host, and the parasite has no right to be here. A human has the sovereign right to be free, to determine what will happen to the body and mind. In this life, however, there are many who would violate that right, ranging from humans in political power, to microscopic organ- isms which cause disease, to non-physical beings who would use the energy of the unsuspecting host. Fortunately, there are techniques for getti ng rid of most of these freeloading parasites, and methods for regaining personal freedom. 79"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"CEVI C hapter 8 THE ALIEN SCIENTISTS After the discovery and identif ication of an attached ET, the specific details of its presence can be determined.

They usually have a large ego attachment to their projects. Dr. B.: \"How much data do you need? How long are you going to stay here? How long have you been here gathering information? Aren't you aware of the spiritual principle of non-inte rference with a sentient sp ecies? Aren't you aware of the 'experimenter effect' here ? You are sitting in the expe rimental subject. You are affecting the results. Your entire research project is flawed. Your data is meaning- less. Your group has expended resources fru itlessly. Your findings are a joke. What will your peer review committee say about th is faulty design and the wasted effort? Where is your science officer? Who is the one in charge of this farce?\" They usually are not aware of an endpoint in the experiment, they have diligently continued the investigation, often through several lif etimes of the host human. It becomes obvious that the attach ed ET researchers are technicians with no authority and no need to know anything more than their specific job. I continue to pepper them with any ques tions that occur to me. I remind them of the scientific method of earth scientists and the peer review committee, chal- lenge them with the idea of who's going to publish first, (Better stop working and hurry home!) and anything else that pops into my mind to say. The ET technician will usually react to these questions and will answer defiantly, defending the project. In very few cases, instead of defiance, the ET might agree with this \"lab rat\" who is questioning the \"white-coat.\" These thoughts may have never occurred to this diligent (and often bored) technician. The entire project is suddenly seen as a useless, meaningless expenditure of time, energy and resources. They are usually eager to end this barren effort. At this point, the technician is ready to exit. Removal of one attached ET is an exer cise in futility. This would accomplish little or nothing for the host, as it would be replaced immediately. Through the consciousness and voice of the client, the fo cus of the dialogue shifts to the com- mand hierarchy, beginning with those in ch arge of the nearby spacecraft. There may be many such technicians and research teams, based on the same ship, survey- 80"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind ing or gathering information from thousands of living humans in the same intrusive way. In this process, we always seek to c onnect with the highest ranking leader, the commander-in-chief. The space commander, crew leader, or the science officer can be summoned, and he will re spond. This always surprise s me. Why do they bother to answer my questions? Lines of communication seem to exist between all member s of this alien bureaucracy. As they speak, the client can repeat their words in our language. They may reveal that they are under orders and ar e part of a fleet of several such craft on similar missions around the earth. They can cross-connect with the deep space station, base headquarters on the homeworld, or their ruling body, whether it is a military cabal or civilian council. The c lient can repeat the words of the alien leaders as they respond. In an altered state, this kind of channeling is easily accom- plished. In a small number of these cases, the base commander has acknowledged the intrusion and has agreed to remove the technicians, the equipment, probes, com- munication devices, any implants, and what ever invasive mechanisms have been placed. They sometimes claim that they were just doing research, much like earth scientists and did not realize that humans would be aware of the intrusion or object to the project. They give the appearance of compassion and quickly cooperate with the request to disengage. We request that the technician remove all equipment, appliances, implanted devices, wiring, and any remnants of the experimentation or residue of its own presence from the research subject, that is , our client. They seem eager to do this and offer an apology for the interference, often a request for forgiveness, and a hearty \"Thank you\" for the new awareness re garding their fruitless research efforts. They are sent home w ith a firm farewell. Th e client can feel the lifting of the weight of the presence, and is very aware of the absence, the f eeling of more room inside for their own soul essence. It is a tremendous relief. An outside observer of such a session mi ght judge this sort of interaction as highly bizarre, even pure fantasy. However, once we get past the initial disbelief and amazement at the course of the di alogue between humans in a therapy session and extraterrestrial aliens in another dimension who are stu dying human life on earth, this process becomes a fascinating study of consciousness. The Dark Side of ET Research As our human scientists probe and dissect animals to learn the secrets of life on earth, so also do some of the extraterrestrial scien tists claim to be conducting experiments with human bein gs. They have implanted ph ysical and non-physical probes and various types of communicating and monitoring devi ces into humans for the purpose of gathering information, and more. Through some of these implanted devices, the aliens seem to be able to control the emotions; other devices control appetites for food or alcohol or sexual activity. In some cases, the anger function is turned up. In others, fear is intensi- 81"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"CEVI fied. Then the experimenters observe what happens to human behavior in personal interactions. They seem to be able to in terfere with or control any aspect of mind or part of the physical body. Mona and the ET Controllers Mona expressed dismay at her unusuall y high sexual appetite and her promis- cuity. This condition had exis ted in her life since late adolescence. She had diffi- culty maintaining monogamous relationships and this ca used her deep sadness and confusion. In session, she di scovered an ET group expe rimenting with her sexual- ity. The ET researchers would intensify her sexual desire, like turning up the volume on a TV set, then observe her behavior and her reactions to her own behavior. We discovered a large netw ork of DFEs of various levels controlling the ETs in this activity. This particular experimentation involved a broad segment of the human population, and Mona was just one of many people affected. The ET technicians divulged this information, and fu rther revealed a sordid picture of the intrusion. Some of the DFE-influenced ETs had become personally involved in human sexuality, purposely stim ulating licentious and depr aved sexual activities. Not only were they distorted in their scien tific observation, they were participating in the experiments. Mona was sickened by the discovery of this information. She had known something was very wrong in her life and suspected en tity influence, but had not dreamed of this kind of extensive involvement, particularly the ETs. She was deeply relieved to finally ge t relief from this terribly intrusive and very personal violation. Human beings are so terribly caught up in sexual issues from childhood through adolescence and into adulthood, even old age as senility sets in. The entire issue is compounded by the social issu es regarding sex, marriage, monogamy, adultery, promiscuity, the religious taboos and imposed guilt, the very real prob- lems of unwanted pregnancy and abortion, disease, human possessiveness and jealousy, and other issues. It is a fertile field for dark force entity interference. These experiments on emo tions and sexuality are oste nsibly designed to study human feelings and behavior. The technician simply turns up the volume on some aspect of emotion or behavior and reco rds what happens with the human subject. This behavior or emotional outburst causes anguish in the human. This is the desired result. This anguish is the underlying goal of the project. The energy emanation of the anguish of human suffering is harvested by the DFEs. It is used as en ergy, sustenance, food. 111 In most such case s we have found, and other therapists report the same situation, it seems the experiment is a cover for the activity of the DFEs. This is the true purpose of the \"research\" conducted by the aliens. In most cases of ET attachment where such a group is operating, the ship captain or the base commander may be evas ive, deceitful, even defiant, and refuse to remove the intrusive de vices and alien beings. They will usually divulge the 82"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind information that there is a high dark being who controls their people. A client will sometimes describe a sinister and menacing dark figure on the craft, clearly exert- ing powerful control, and always situated near the ship's captain. The ET technician is usually unaware of the dark influence. The commander of the space craft is conscious of the dark pr esence in about half of such cases. The ruling council members on the homeworld are aw are of the dark lords in charge at various levels. They acknowledge that they, or their predecessors in the council, struck an alliance with the dark forces long ago for the purpose of gaining personal and political power. However, once that dark contract was established, the DFEs took power over the council. The DFEs as sumed \"ownership\" of the alien civiliza- tion, and there was nothing that could be done about it. The council members, usually from thr ee to eleven in number (though once it was reported as a senate of about 1800 members), are grateful for the assistance in separating themselves and their citizens fr om the DFEs. With the assistance of many light beings, we facilitate the total removal of the dark force entities, from the lowliest DFE attached to the ET t echnicians, through the dark lords on the craft, to the high-level dark beings wielding power over the council members and the overseers or enforcers who lurk behind the scenes. After the release of the DF Es from their civilization, the council gladly orders the removal of the implants, monitors , communication devices, various and as- sorted headbands and skullcaps, and the ET technicians. They or der the return of all the craft orbiting this world and any other, and the space stations involved in this hideous project. A tremendous piece of wo rk is completed in a very short time. The effect on consciousness cannot be measured. Clients have discovered not only these attached ET technicians and their equipment, but also unattended probes and other devices in various parts of the anatomy and in the chakras, or energy cen ters of the body, both on themselves and other family members. These probes are non-physical in nature yet connected in a way which allows for transmission of information to the ET scientist's location. The probe, or connector, may also allow th e ET to remotely control some aspect of the physiology or mental/emotio nal functioning of the person. In an altered state, a client can visualize the probe, often a black cord, leading to the ET laboratory. We direct the ques tion to the alien researcher. This communi- cation passes directly to the ETs along the attached connector, and the surprised ET will answer through the voi ce mechanism of the client . This can be surprising and distressing to the client, but with our assurance that the control is only tempo- rary, and that many people have overcome this intrusion, most clients continue with the dialogue. The DFE Tank Farm In one case, a middle aged woman disc overed what appeared to be a conduit attached in the area of the ba se of her spine. There was no pretense about research; this was an energy pipeline sucking life force from her. As she traced the conduit in her inner imagery, she found it extending far out in \"space\" to another location, a 83"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"CEVI small planet. The workers on that place we re slow thinking, dull-witted beings who attended the collection and storage stations for this life energy, huge \"tank farms\" similar to those of petroleum refineries in our own land. This was their only job. Similar conduits came in fr om all directions to th is storage facility, from countless beings living on many worlds. Th ese workers received a small percentage of the life force energy collected in this way as their compensation from a powerful group of higher beings on another planet who controlled the operation. They didn't seem to be aware of anything else. We called on the leader of the higher beings. He responded. Yes, his people had arranged this collection and storage network for life force energy. Yes, these workers performed this duty for them. Yes, the DFEs were in charge of his people, and had been for a long time. Yes, the DFEs ordered the placem ent of this entire life force energy collection sy stem. Yes, the DFEs took the life force energy for their own purposes. Yes, his people were actually slaves to the DFEs. No, there was nothing they could do about it. Yes, they would appreciate any assistance to free themselves. In the name of the Light, we demanded to speak to the dark commander in control of this operation. In a few mome nts, this one responded through the voice of the client. He was surprised and irr itated by this interruption. Yes, his dark associates used some of the energy, but mostly it was taken to an even higher level in the dark realm. He knew nothing about that level. We called on the Rescue Spirits of Li ght to surround this dark commander in a net of light, a mesh of light, a capsule of light, to bind this one in light. We asked the Rescue Spirits of Light to move th rough the group of dark ones on that planet, binding each of them in light, wher ever they were in that moment. We directed the commander to focus with in himself. The firs t deception in the dark realm is that there is no light within the individual being. Once they believe that, they are under total subjugation by thei r dark superiors. They are controlled by threat of annihilation. The second deception is that they can be annihilated, they can be destroyed, they will cease to exist. The third deception is that the light will harm them, burn them, destroy them. So, of course, they avoid the light. The DFEs are totally controlled by threat and fear through these three deceptions. The commander was astonished when he discovered his own spark of light. His entire focus was on the spark as it expanded. It felt warm. He recalled the Light and the warmth from his far memory. He recalled his origin in the Light, and he instantly rejected the three controll ing deceptions. He made a new choice for the Light. This is the transformation of a demon. As he reconsidered the co llection and storage project, he realized the terrible invasiveness, the abject violation of the fr ee will of countless God-created beings. He agreed to begin to demolish the system. He also agreed to assist in the gathering and transformation of the legions of DF Es under his command. Through the lines of communication to all his underlings he summoned them from distant outposts and directed them to focus within as he had done. The Rescue Spirits of 84"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind Light gathered them as they came in, each in its own capsule of light. This is a grandly efficient method of releasing the DFEs as compared to going through the process with each individual demon. According to clients in thousands of sessions through the years, it works. As these DFEs rush in, clients describe the scene like a flood of darkness, like a river of lava or thick, black oil, flowi ng toward the Light. Each DFE is encapsu- lated in light; each discovers its spark; each transforms into light. The Rescue Spirits of Light transport them to their own place in the Light. This is an awesome visual image to the client in an altered state of consciousness. Checking with the leader of the higher level beings again, we found him and his people in celebration of their restored freedom. They were grateful for the assistance. They had abandoned all aspects of the energy collection project. The \"equipment\" was being dismantled. This would free many hum ans and countless others from this energy drain. We directed the client to examine th e area where she had first discovered the conduit. Even after this releasement of multitudes of DFEs, it was still in place! Again following up the conduit, she found the storage planet. One of the dull- witted ones had emerged with some origin al thinking of his own. He saw this project as a pretty good d eal, even considered some potential commercial possibili- ties here. This one was not so dull-witted. He was now thinking as a business man, and he had red eyes. This clearly indicated the direction we need ed to follow in the session. In the imagery of the client, red eyes on any human being, ET, animal, or black blob, indicates DFE energy. When the transformed dark commander on the other planet began summoning his troops, this would-be entrepreneur had stepped forward and severed connec- tions, both the communication lines and the pipelines to that place. He decided to keep the life force energy collection syst em for himself and his own people. Of course, other DFEs were directing his thinking and trying to cut their losses. We again called, in the name of the Light, to the one in charge of this group. The breakaway dark commander came forward grudgingly, and divulged his rebellion against his commander's summons. The Rescue Spirits of Light again did their job, the DFEs went through the tr ansformation, and the dull-witted ones agreed to dismantle their part of the system. The conduit disappeared from the base of the spine of the client. She felt the relief, though she had not been aware of the intrusive device nor the energy drain prior to the session. She had only known that something was not right. After attending a lecture on SRT, sh e felt the inner urging to e xplore with us in a private session. She was amazed at what she disc overed, and delighted at the results. Harvesting Energy In another case, a woman wanted to expl ore past life therapy. There was no specific problem area, she just wanted to experience the work. She only knew we did regression therapy. We explained that it is the inner knowing self that directs the session, and we don't lead a client into past lives. She was willing to explore 85"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"CEVI whatever emerged. As she scanned her bod y, she discovered a disruption of energy in her abdomen, the solar plexus area. It seemed to be tight, and she felt a little nauseous. Dr. B.: \"If that tight feeling coul d speak, what would it say, right now?\" C: \"What do you want?\" Dr. B.: \" What are you doing here?\" C: \"Taking her energy.\" Very straightforward, no subterfuge, no cover story. Dr. B.: \"Have you ever been hum an in your own physical body?\" C: \"No.\" Dr. B.: \"What color is the light in your universe?\" C: \"Orange.\" Dr. B.: \"What do you do with the energy?\" C: \"Send it up to the Big Dark Ones.\" There was no craft. There was no home planet. No subjugated ET civiliza- tion. No intermediaries. These were energy draining DFEs who ju st hung out in an orange light place. We have found that the red, orange , black, and so metimes dark purple light locations seem to be domains of the DFEs. This band of intruders was simply sucking energy from this wo man and many other humans. The DFEs responded to the process of tran sformation and were released. We continued the session with soul fr agmentation recovery. Her essence had been slowly drained away. Most of th is was recovered and reintegrated. The woman felt weary yet peaceful and somehow more complete. The late Robert Monroe, a former co rporate executive, was a pioneer in describing and publishing personal experience and research in the out-of-body experience, the OOBE.\" 2 He details his battles with entities he called \"demons.\" In some of his out-of-body excursions, he rea lizes there are \"entities\" riding him like a child playfully rides horseyback astride the back of an adult. He describes one OOBE in which he was manning an an cient pumping station with huge pipes transporting something of much higher ener gy than oil, valuable and vitally needed elsewhere. Is this life force energy si phoned from humans transported to other places for use by opportunistic beings? We have found many such cases in clinical practice. The Vampires The DFEs believe they have no spark of light at their center. This is the first deception in the dark realm. They believe they do not have their own source of energy. No light, no energy, no sustenance. Th ey have to steal energy from the best source on the planet: unsuspecting human be ings. Their superiors believe the same thing. Their job is to squelch the light in th e target humans and reap as much of the host's energy as possible for transport to the higher realms of darkness. They are literally stealing life force or soul energy from the host. This leads to all sorts of human ailments and sympto ms of illness. This is not new in human history. In indigenous cultures, the healer is ca lled the shaman. In shamanic literature, 86"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind illness is thought to be caused by soul loss. 113 Soul theft often occurs because one person assumes power over another person. The survivor of sexual abuse often describes feeling as if the perpetrator (f ather, stepfather, grandfather, uncle) has stolen her soul. In every case involving sexu al abuse that we have seen in clinical practice, there are DFEs involved. Soul theft may be the result of a curse, hex, or spell cast by a witch, black magician, or sorcerer. Black magic always involves the DFEs. This type of curse and soul fragmentation is sometimes disc overed in past lives, and the curse may still be affecting the clie nt in the present life. Many women report love affairs with me n who were possessive, even violent. These affairs often end with bitterness. In some cases, the men have vowed to keep the women under their control and to possess their heart or soul. In sessions with these women, when we can explore these men remotely, they are found to be partially or totally controlled by DFEs. Vampirism is a cultur al myth that predates Christ ianity. It concerns the extrac- tion of blood or life force from living pe ople without killing them . The creature of the myth has taken many forms: demons ; the incubus and succubus; handsome men, beautiful women, both of which are shap e shifters; black magicians; night- flying astral bloodsuckers; spirits of the undead and others.\" 4 DFEs are integral to this kind of activity. At the time of a disaster such as an earthquake, volcano, war, or plane crash resulting in death, the DFEs attempt to seize as many of th e confused souls as they can. People who die with the emotion of guilt are susceptible to the DFEs. In the movie Ghost, the two bad guys died and were im mediately snatched away by dark entities. Mind fragments of living pe ople can be capt ured by the DFEs. These are the activities of the DFEs: undermining the power of love; chaos and destruction in human lives; control a nd power over others; soul theft; sucking life force; snatching soul s and mind fragments during traumatic and confusing events. This holds true on this planet as well as other worlds, other realms, other planes and dimensions. In human interaction, the DFEs attempt to cause as much chaos and destruc- tion, disruption and strife between people as they can. Individua lly, this shows up as low self esteem. In loving relationships between two people, this interference can lead to upset, separation and divor ce, even domestic violence and murder. Soul groups of people co me back lifetime after life time to be together in healing and loving interactions. 115 Love is the healing en ergy in this world and beyond. The DFEs attempt to interfere with the healing power of Light/Love wherever and whenever they can. They claim that it's just their job. 87"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"CEV1 C h a p t e r 9 BARGAINING WITH THE FORCES OF DARKNESS The pact with the Devil, the covenant with Satan, joining in league with Lucifer, this is the stuff of horror movies and Gothic nove ls of torture set in medi- eval castles. Echoes of Dr. Faust! The very mention of the Inquisition, nightmare that it was, calls forth scenes of wild accusations of witches and charges of traf- ficking with the Devil and the terrible tort ure that was meted out. Burning at the stake, death on the rack, and other inhuma n torture led many a poor wretch to call on the forces of darkness for vengeance. At these grotesquely pivotal moments in the existence of a being, personal spiritual evolution took a backward step as the choice was made for the darkness. 116 All through the history of armed conflict, warriors have called on the dark forces as they charged into battle. Pr ayer to God does no good at that moment, they say. God does not assist one soldier in killing another. Spirits of the battlefield dead may remain earthbound for centuries, held captive by the DFEs who came in at the moment of the fear-based request . The DFEs cannot grant protection against mortal wounds. Soldiers who strike such a last minute bargain with the dark forces enjoy a feeling of invulnerability. They ar e unpleasantly surprised at their ensuing death and subsequent bondage to the darkness. Countless humans have struck bargains with the devil, in this life or another, for myriad self-serving purposes, and for th e health or safety of loved ones. In some cases, the bargains are purposely ma de, in others, the connection is made inadvertently by accepting an invitation, veiled or overt, from the dark ones. The Dark One does not bargain in good faith; there is no time limit specified. The human thinks only in terms of this lifet ime. The Dark One th inks in terms of eternity but does not declare this fact. Once these contracts ar e established, DFEs are assigned. The person is under the cont rol of the dark forces for a long, long time. This becomes a terrible dark bondage. In many instances the agreement is a conscious act and deliberately sought. The most serious summoning of Satan is for the express purpose of creating a formal pact. The pact usually guarantees so me earthly gain, such as personal or political power, secret knowle dge and psychic ability, mate rial wealth, or securing the favors of a desirable woman or man. The Dark One delights in offering such transient rewards in return for th e eternal soul of the bargainer. 117 Following the death of the victim of su ch a contract, the hapless spirit can go through the cycle of the Light and incarnate again, and the contract is reactivated immediately at birth; DFEs are reassigned . This captive human being continues the perverse work of the darkness through his/her own physical body, in bondage to, and totally controlled by, the dark forces lifetime after lifetime. Just as often, the newly deceased spirit remains earthbound (with a nested, 88"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind controlling DFE) and continues to serve the dark ones, often by attaching to another human. When it is discovered in a session, this EB acts like a DFE, both in its reaction to the discovery questions, and the disclosure of its purpose. Yet it claims to have been alive in its own hu man body. These EBs are usually assigned as lower or middle level commanders. They aren't the lowly growlers, hissers, or snarlers. In session, I suggest to the client who ha s formed such a pact, in this life or another, or with an attached entity who succumbed to the temptation: Dr. B.: \"Recall the moment when you chose for the darkness.\" This poor soul will immediately recall the fateful moment: as a warrior going into battle; as a witch be ing burned at the stake; 118 as a politician coveting more power; or some other equally crucial choice point. As they begin to remember their experience since that moment, they are more than willing, they are eager to end the bondage, to clear their mind of the distor tion, and renounce the nefarious pact. We lead them in pronouncing the Renunciation of the Darkness, a phrase at a time. The entity is making the pronouncement, throug h the voice mechanism of the client. Dr. B.: \"Repeat these words. Make them your own. It does you no good for me to say them for you. You must repeat them as your own.\" The therapist must be sensitive to the re ligious views of the client. For those who do not object to the name of Jesus Ch rist, the Holy Name is used. For those who are sensitive for any reason, th e term \"Light\" is substituted. \"In the name of the Light, may God rebuke you, darkness.\" The entity/client repeats this se ntence and each of the following: \"I renounce all activities of the darkness.\" \"I revoke all contracts and agreements, invitations and invocations, rituals and initiations with the darkness.\" \"Throughout eternity, for as long as my soul exists.\" \"For in the name of the Light, it is so.\" The entity/client repeats. After 20 or 30 seconds of silence, I ask softly: Dr. B.: \"How does that feel?\" There is normally a deep f eeling of relief, both for th e attached entity and for the client. When a person is infested with a DFE, there is a possibility that there has been some invitation or acceptance in this or some past time. The pronounce- ment thus serves double duty; the attached EB with nested DFE and the client are both released from their respective agreements with the darkness. The dark ones can then be released more readily from the client, and from the confused and misguided earthbound spirit. The same pronouncement is used with an y client who recalls a past lifetime when they interacted with the dark forces in any way, whether they were involved in sorcery, black magic, witchcraft, dark brotherhood or priesthood, or Satanic cult activity of any kind. The dark force energy distorts the thinking just enough that the person actually believes that what he/she is doi ng is just exactly what he/she wants to be 89"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"CEVI doing. Without some interven tion such as SRT, this behavior would continue unabated, even for lifetimes, the confused thinking well entrenched. A formal and binding relationship with Go d calls for belief in God, devotion to duty and service to mankind. These are th e monastic and religious vows. God does not want anything else for Himself, only what is in the best interest for the human. A pact with the devil is quite different in essence and form. The devil demands something for hims elf while giving precious little to the human who calls for the pact. God covenants with people or with mankind. 119 The devil contracts specifically with individual persons. Traditiona lly, the pact with th e devil is signed in blood by the human and kept by the devil. Similar pacts and bargains have apparently been struck between the leaders of alien civilizations and the Forces of Da rkness. These malevolent bargains inflict terrible oppression on the alien citizens an d often have damaging and far-reaching consequences for planet Earth and her human inhabitants. The Dark Reptilian Charles was a practicing hypnotherapist. He also had strong psychic abilities. He volunteered for a demonstration in an SRT training class. Unless something has already surfaced or been discovered with a person, we do not specify a subject nor a particular direction in these demo sessi ons. The volunteer is instructed to scan his/her body for any emotional feeling or physical sensation. There is always something. We proceed with the discovery questions: \"If it had a size or shape, what would that be?\" \"If it had a color, what would it be?\" \"If it had a sound, what would it sound like?\" \"If it had words, what would they be?\" \"If it could speak, what would it be saying, right now?\" There is a pause after each question to allow for any response. If there is an entity, it is usually aroused by these que stions and it will most certainly have something to say to us by the time the last question is posed. The earthbound spirit will be frightened and confused, or belligerent an d defensive. The DFE will be hostile, defiant, and arrogant. The ET will be surprised that we are bothering it when it is either gathering data of a \"scientific\" nature, collecting energy for its controllers, or here to take over. It usually challenge s our right to disturb its activities or question its right to be present. Through the discovery questions, the one with Charles was identified as an ET with DFE influence. Once again, we connected with the ru ling council, the lead ers of this alien civilization. They acknowledged the erstwh ile connection with the dark forces. They welcomed our a ssistance. I had an intuitive fl ash that the high dark com- mander was not in the council chambers with the others. My questions were directed at the council leader. Dr. B.: \"Look around in your chambers. Is he there? Perhaps in an anteroom, somewhere behind the scenes, in an adjoining room. Is he behind the walls, hidden from your view.\" 90"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind Charles' perception shifted to a room close to the Council Chambers and he described the dark controller. At first it appeared to Charles as a large reptilian figure, standing upright, surprised at being de tected. This type is often described in the UFO literature. The reptoids have a bad reputation. I called on the Rescue Spirits of Light to surround this reptilian being in the capsule of light. I demanded, in the name of the Light, that it show its true form. It immediately shape-shifted into a dark blob . This had been a deceptive disguise. The high dark commander had adopted the figure of the ill-reputed reptilian. It quickly went through its transformation and chose the Light for itself. It began to assist by calling in its underli ngs, the entire group of DFEs which had been infesting this group of aliens. They were taken into the appropriate place in the Light. And another alien civilization was freed from their dark bondage. There are planets and perhaps universes where the Light of the Universal Mind, or Christ Consciousness as it is of ten termed, has not yet penetrated. The Lucifer energy arrived there first and is re vered as God in some of these locations. When we discover them, the dark ones ar e treated with the standard SRT proce- dures and transported to the Light. \"The Kingdom of Heaven is within you: and whosoever knoweth himself shall find it.\" 120 At the core of every God-created bein g is a spark of Light, a spark of the God consciousness.

It is still used by priests of the Catholic Church in cases of solemn exorcism. Between 1970 and 1980, there were more than 600 solemn exorcisms performed in the United States alone. 121 It is still a viable procedur e in the Church, though rarely publicized. Basically, the inte raction between the possessing demon and the priest- exorcist is adversarial; the demon is cast out in the name of Jesus Christ, without a specified destination. The procedure offers no love, no compassion, no concern whatsoever for the entity, as though the fallen angel were not a God-created being. This form of exorcism is irresponsible with regard to the treatment and disposal of the entity. The demon can return to the same person. It can find another unwitting victim, or it can att ach to the priest-exorcist. It is like removing a nail from a flat tire and tossing it out into the street. The person who tossed it, or anyone else driving by, can pi ck it up in their tire again. Releasement Of The Demonic Entity The foundation of Spirit Releasement Th erapy is the knowledge that all God- created beings contain the monad, the i ndestructible, eternal spark of God con- sciousness. All else is illusory and transitory , part of the duality that constitutes this physical reality which encompasses good a nd evil, light and dark, right and wrong, and other polarities. The Book of Revela tions outlines the beginning of the game, the act of choosing sides: Light or darkness. 122 Every spark of God will return, and eventually all will join in th e Oneness. This includes Lu cifer, the ulti mate prodigal son, and his legions of demons, the \"Forces of Darkness.\" The process of spirit releasement of the DFEs requires imagination, visual imagery, and acceptance of cert ain spiritual figures. This is not a religious exercise and does not require adherence to any religi ous belief or practice. This is explained to the client before a session begins. Cert ain names may be used in the session, and specific beings may be called upon for he lp, such as Archangel Michael and the Christ Consciousness. 123 Once the attached entity is identified as a DFE, the therapist calls on the Warrior Angels of Light to form a basti on of light entirely around the location of the session, the homes of all concerned, all friends, family, and loved ones in- volved. These powerful beings of light stand against any darkness that would interfere in the work of the session. The therapist requests the Rescue Spirits of Light to bind the DFE in a net of light, a mesh of light, a capsule of light, impervious, impenetrable, and inescapable. 92"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind As the capsule of light squ eezes, the dark one begins to feel the pressure and its edges begin to fade. The beings of light who assist in this process may be archetypal or totally imaginary. They may be ab solutely real, spiritually evolved, conscious beings existing in a non-physical r eality, a different vibration or dimension than the Earth level. Perhaps they dwell in the imaginal realm where ETs exist, along with angels and many other conscious beings. 124 The true dark force entities have not been human, so they have no experience of dying, though they may have a sense of the concept due to contact with human minds. As their edges beco me fuzzy, gray, or ragged, they often fear annihilation. They think fading means di sappearing, ceasing to exist. The following is a typical dialogue between the therapist and a DFE attached to the client, speaking through the client's voice. Dr. B.: \"What did your superiors tell you th e light would feel like if it came this close to you?\" DFE: \"They said it would burn.\" Dr. B.: \"Is it burning?\" DFE: \"No.\" Dr. B.: \"Did they lie to you?\" DFE: \"Yes, they said it would burn.\" Dr. B.: \"That's the third deception: that the light is harmful in any way. What did they say would happen to you if the light came close like this?\" DFE: \"They told me I wo uld be destroyed, I would disappear, I would cease to exist.\" Dr. B.: \"That's the second deception, th at you can be destroyed, that you can cease to be. Are you being destroyed? Are you disappearing?\" DFE: \"No. Well, something's ch anging, my edges are fading.\" There is very little belligerence at this point. The DFE's focus has been turned from its assignment with the client and its defiance and threats towards the thera- pist to fear for its own su rvival. With guidance and the assistance of the therapist, it begins to understand that it has been deceived. Dr. B.: \"What did your superiors tell you about what's inside you?\" DFE: \"There is nothing there excep t darkness (or hatred, or fire).\" Dr. B.: \"Turn and look deep inside your self. Begin to focus deep inside. Tunnel to your center, to the very center of your being, to the very core of your essence. What do you find?\" DFE: \"Nothing, it's just dark.\" Dr. B.: \"That is the first deception. Keep looking. Through the darkness, through the layers of black slime. Keep look ing, keep going, right into your center. What do you see there? Look carefully.\" DFE: \"There is some light. Just a little pinpoint of light.\" The Light inside has been described as a pinpoint, a flicker, a spark, a candle, a little flame, a red coal, a pearl, a diamond, a star, a ruby, a crystal, an emerald, a fire, a sun, and ot her similar images. 93"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"CEVI Dr. B.: \"What happens to that little light as you continue to watch it?\" DFE: \"It's glowing bright er, it's getting bigger.\" This nearly always happens with this type of entity after they discover their own spark of light. Dr. B.: \"Move closer to it. How does it feel? Does it burn?\" DFE: \"No, it doesn't burn. It feels warm.\" Dr. B.: \"How long since you felt warm?\" DFE: \"I can't remember.\" Dr. B.: \"Step into it. It is your own light. It is the cent er of your being. This is what you are. Step right into it. Stand tall in your own light. How does that feel?\" As the dark being steps into its own light, the darkness disappears. DFE: \"It's warm and peaceful.\" Dr. B.: \"How long since you felt warm and peaceful?\" DFE: \"I don't remember.\" Dr. B.: \"What has happened to your dark form, the darkness we first saw?\" DFE: \"It's gone.\" This is the transformation of a demon, and the dialogue nearly always follows this pattern. It is a straightforward therapeutic process. Dr. B.: \"They deceived you. They told you there was no light at your center. That is the first deception. It is the deni al of God, a deception of the first magni- tude. This pinpoint of Light is the spark of God consciousness. It is the spark at the center of your being which gives you eter nal life. No one can take it from you. The dark masters can neither give you life nor can they destroy it. \"Once you believe the first deception, that there is no light at your center, you will believe the second deception, that you can cease to be, that you can be de- stroyed. After that you will believe anythin g. They tell you the light is harmful, that it will burn, and you must stay away from it. If you be lieve this third deception and obey this command, you will never learn ab out the light. How does it feel to know they deceived you from the beginning?\" DFE: \"I don't like it. I'm angry. They lied to me.\" Dr. B.: \"Would you continue to serve these masters who deceived you like this?\" DFE: \"No.\" Since they rebelled and left the God Source, the dark force entities, the minions of Lucifer, the legions of demons , have been controlled by these three deceptions, the fear of punishment, and the threat of annihilation. With this brief intervention, the DFEs discover within themselves the trut h of their being, the seed of personal transformation, the key to freedom. Dr. B.: \"Would you like to make a new choice? Would you choose for the Light this day?\" They almost always say yes. They like the feeling of the light within them- selves. They aren't stupid, just ignorant about the light. Dr. B.: Say the words: 'I choose for the Light.'\" DFE: \"I choose for the Light.\" 94"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind Dr. B.: \"We witness your choice and the Universe recognizes your choice. You are free.\" Transformed DFE: \"Thank you.\" Dr. B.: \"You're welcome. Rescue Spirits of Light, lift this one to its own appointed place in the Light. We send you to your own place in the Light, little friend, and we say farewell.\" This process does not seem like an exorci sm of a demon, yet it is very effec- tive with all levels of DFEs we have encountered. The approach is not the adversarial position of a pr iest or deliverance minister, with rancor and animosity toward this foul thing, but from a compassionate stance of tough love for a God- created being who went astray. Long ago this spirit made a serious erro r and chose the dark path. It caused untold misery to countless beings along that path. It has also suffered its own pain in the darkness. There is a great deal more involved in the process than this brief description would suggest, yet this is the final outcome in nearly every case 125 Some critics have condemned this process because they believed the darkness would or could contaminate the light, c ould diminish Heaven . What a limited and demeaning view of the power of the Li ght! The transformed DFEs are taken to their own appointed place in the Light, not the same destination where human spirits go after physical death. In any cas e, the darkness is a covering illusion, much like a child's Halloween cost ume, and it disappears as the little being discovers its own light, steps into its own light, and beco mes the light by choice. No, the Light is not contaminated by receiving one of its ow n creations that has gone astray. When we bring the darkness to the Light, it is the dark that is transformed, not the Light that is changed. The question arises about the reality of demons and demonic possession. In an orderly universe created by God, why would He allow such beings to exist? Why would He allow His human creat ions to be so plagued by them? Why is such chaos allowed in the world? Some people have sp eculated that this is His way of giving humans an incentive to strive for somethi ng better. The dark ones act like starting blocks for a runner, some thing to give the impetus for forward movement, something to push against. In the act of creation, He gave His created beings, expanding and extending from the All That Is, the indi vidual sparks of consciousne ss, the power of free will. This is the greatest of His gifts. As great as this gift is, there must be something equally significant to choose between fo r this power of free will choice to be meaningful. There must be something upon which to exercise the power of choice, something of enormous impact. It may be the choice between Light and darkness. This theoretical model of the spiritual realm of dark energies grows out of more than 17 years of clinical experience in working with thes e beings, expressing through thousands of clients in private sessions. The model wo rks; the hypothesis stands the test of time. Many people have learned these methods and find similar success with the DFEs and see results in their clients. The elements of this model are similar in many ways to the established religious and spiritual literature on the 95"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"CEVI subject. Where we differ is in huma n experience versus religious dogma. There are evils which are acknowledged by the majority of men and women and almost universally rejected. The archetype of the devil is the nucleus around which these rejected elements gather, and it is from this nucleus that they in turn derive their power. The devil appears in some form in all religions and myths. He is seen as the eternal opponent of all that is good in the world. The devil, or Satan, which means adversary or accuser, or diabol os, in Greek, the slanderer, is, and has always been, very much a part of human consciousness. In materialistic Western culture, even in most churches, the existence of an actual Prince of Darkness with legions of demons under his co mmand is considered as symbolic, metaphoric, even mythical. O fficially, the mental health professions continue to deny anything spiritual, certain ly the personification of evil in the form of a devil. In private sessions behi nd closed doors however, many licensed professionals are using past life therapy, re covery of soul frag mentation, and spirit releasement therapy w ith amazing results and producing some remarkable healings. Whether the force of Darkness is a fi gment of imagination, a product of the rantings of zealous prophets, a projection of ego, a creation of the collective unconscious, a God-created adversary, or something else yet unknown, the specu- lations regarding good and evil will, without a doubt, continue unabated. The process of Spirit Releasement Ther apy is distinct from any religious tradition or methodology of e xorcism. In clinical practice there is no need for concern regarding religious conjecture or superstition. Whether it is imagination, archetype, the psychological shadow, collective hallucinations, mass hypnosis, a projection of the beliefs of the therapis t or something else again, the DFEs and their effects exist in some form and have impact in this consensus reality. They correspond to the historic description and classic behavior attributed to demons. They show up in clin ical practice, they affect human beings, and the effects can be eliminated with the appropriate techniques. Regardless of any religious belief or dogma, the dark force entities are actively involved in our pe rsonal and planetary evolution. 96"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind C hapter 11 MIND POWER, MIND CONTROL When I first began studyi ng hypnosis for dentistry, I had no idea what new frontiers I was approaching. Hand levitation and glove anesthesia that could be transferred to the mouth in preparation fo r dental work seemed like miracle stuff. And indeed it is for the many people who ha ve a terrible fear of dentists. However, it only takes a few weekend classes in hypnodontics 126 to learn just about all there is to know about the subject. This knowledge sparked my curiosity, my interest was kindled, and there was no stopping. I continued to study hypnosis and the farther reaches of the human mind, the subconscious, and the deeper realms of the unconscious. 127 What most intrigued me was the power of the subc onscious mind over the functions of the body. With dental hypnosis , a person can control gaggi ng, saliva flow, the swallow reflex, breathing, and, with post hypnotic suggestion, bl eeding, swelling, pain, and rapidity of healing after leaving the of fice. Experienced meditators can control blood pressure, heart rate, and other au tonomic mechanisms. Through self hypno- sis, similar control over the body can be attained. With biofeedback training, a person can control some of these autonomi c functions while in a totally conscious state. One of the basic teachings regarding the us e of hypnosis is that all hypnosis is self hypnosis. In the dental chair, and in the psychotherapy setting, the client willingly accepts the suggestions of the fac ilitator, to ease the discomfort of the dental procedures, or to uncover the source of painful emotional conflicts. So there is some validity in the teaching about self hypnosis in these settings. However, this is one of the great myths of mind scien ce, and those who would control the minds of others know this quite well. Neuro-Linguistic Programming™ (NLP ) was developed by John Grinder and Richard Bandler. 128 It is essentially the distillation of hyp notic communication techniques of Milton Erickson, M.D., the ackno wledged master of clinical hypno- therapy. The methodolog y of NLP includes embedded verbal commands, body postures, and hand motions which can in fluence another person without their knowledge. It can be used in the therapy setting, a sales pres entation, a court of law, or any interpersonal interaction. Obvi ously, it can be used for the purpose of mind control. It is no secret that the advertising in dustry takes advantage of consumer's suggestibility. Most of us are in the thrall of cultural trance, the combination and culmination of the emotional surroundings, mental attitudes and judgements, and social pressures that have enveloped us since conception and birth. This involves the standards and mores of our society, th e customs and acceptable social behavior 97"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"CEVI patterns, the recognized and accepted religi ons, forms of humor, music, and the arts. 129 This also includes the political tone which promotes loyalty and patriotism to a country, even to the extent that soldiers will fight \"enemy\" soldiers to the death over arbitrary geographical borders. Also shaped by the cultural hypnosis is the prevailing Zeitgeist, the intellec- tual climate of the times. 130 In the middle ages, the prevailing Zeitgeist allowed for the existence of spirits and demon possession. The intellectual climate in contem- porary civilization endorses no such condition, nor does it countenance the exist- ence of aliens, UFOs, or abduction by the a liens who ride in those UFOs. In the current model of scientific thinking, it can't exist, therefore it doesn 't exist. Like species of living things on the plan et, science also evolves: the earth is no longer flat, nor is it the center of the universe; rocks do fall from the sky; disease is no longer caused by spirits (except when it is), and the Air Force ac- knowledges some unexpl ained aerial events. With the possibility that five million people may have been contacted or abducted by aliens, as well as reports from therapists across the country describing su ccessfully treated cases of spirit posses- sion and spirit attachment, there is pressure toward evolution in the Zeitgeist to include these experiences. In 1991, the late Carl Sagan made th is statement during the Commencement Address at UCLA: It is the responsibility of scientis ts never to suppress knowledge, no matter how awkward that knowledge is, no matter how much it may bother those in power. We are not sm art enough to decide which pieces of knowledge are permissible and which are not. In the early days of legitimate research in hypnosis after the \"gross humbug\" of Mesmerism, 131 several prominent inve stigators were explor ing the possibilities of hypnosis, or induced sleep, as they pe rceived it. Hypnosis was known to be effective when used directly with a susceptible person. Hypnosis at a distance, or telepathic hypnosis, was also report ed. Paris born Pie rre Janet (1859-1947) founded a new system of dynamic psychiatry which was one of the main sources for Freud, Adler, and Jung. In a paper given at a major professional meeting in 1895, Janet described his experiments with his subject, Leonie. He was able to easily hypnotize the young woma n, not only directly in a face to face situation, but also from a distance. He could give her \"mental\" suggestions that she would carry out exactly. 132 Other experimenters repeated this telepathic induction of hypnosis at a distance. In some cases they could influe nce the subject's behavior in addition to inducing the trance. 133 James Esdaile performed more than 3 00 surgeries and amputations, many on the battlefield, using only hypnosis as anesthesia. Th is occurred in India before 1850. 134 His mortality rate was less than 5%. Hitler controlled a nation with his rhetoric, so persuasive and hypnotic an orator was he. Control over the subconscious mind can be used for benef it or harm, depending on the intention of the hypnotist. 98"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind There is no doubt that hypnosis can be us ed to influence, or control, the susceptible mind. Certain drugs can increa se the susceptibility, and this is all that is required to control a group (of any size) of people rendering them docile, obedient, and loyal. The mind-altering, consci ousness-expanding drug LSD was first researched in humans in the early '50s. The CIA was funding research on electromagnetic mind control at least as early as 1960. The notorious MKULTRA proj ect was expanded to include not only hypnosis and psychedelic drugs, but bioel ectric sensing methods for surveillance and interrogation, as well as for finding techniques for activating the human organism by remote electronic means. In testimony before the Senate Subcommit- tee on Health and Scientific Research on September 21, 1977, MKULTRA director Sidney Gottlieb recalled a running interest in the effects on people standing in the field of radio energy, and whether a pers on could be more easily hypnotized if he were standing in a radio beam. The 1977 Congressional Record contains a report from the Senate Select Committee to Study Government Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activi- ties (\"The Church Committee\"). This report details the history of covert mind control experiments (often performed illegally on unwitting U.S. citizens) con- ducted by agencies of the U.S. Governme nt. Under the code name of Project MKULTRA, techniques such as psychoactiv e drugs, hypnosis, bio-electronics, Radio Hypnotic Intracerebral Control (R HIC), Electronic Disso lution of Memory (EDOM), occult and parapsychological re search, radiation, microwaves, and ultrasonics were explored. Several proved to be quite effective. One CIA \"consult- ant\" spoke to the committee of electronic im plants used for remote mind control. Another spoke of systemati cally creating multiple pers onalities within individuals for intelligence activities. Another spoke of creating false memories as a cover for all the other activities. The Church Comm ittee, of course, said \"No, no!\" And the agency, of course, promised to \"cease and desist.\" The intelligence agencies, primarily the CIA, conducted hu man research on thousands of people, often without thei r knowledge or consent, at least through the '60s. 135 One possible application of such research is the control of enemy populations, both civilian and military. A more insidious ap plication of such tech- nology would be the control the population of our own country. The descriptions of the research in this country present a hideous panorama of man's inhumanity to man. 136 Remote viewing has been de veloped into a practical, teachable skill. Since it was primarily a military project, presumab ly in conjunction w ith the intelligence agencies of this country, it is highly like ly the skill was developed not only as a spying device, but also as a weapon. In the mental state of consciousness required for remote viewing, the viewer can focu s on a target person or location and per- ceive details of the target. It many be possi ble for the viewer to influence a target person, even to the point of causing death. In a ground-breaking experiment, Jose Delgado, a neurophysiologist from the Yale University School of Medicine, ma naged to halt a charging bull only thirty 99"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"CEV1 feet from his completely vul nerable body. In his hand he held a small black box which transmitted a radio si gnal to a similar black box which contained a small receiver fastened between the horns of th e bull. The signal was transmitted as an electric impulse through a probe inserted in to the bull's brain. The bull ring was in Madrid, Spain. The year was 1964, and De lgado had been experimenting with electronic stimulation of the brain (ESB) for nearly two decades. 138 Research expanded into stimulation without an implanted receiver, using electromagnetic fields and beamed microwaves. The use of non-lethal weapons includes specific frequencies of microwaves that can stimulate certain areas of the brain which control certain emotions a nd, through the neurological-physiological interface, bodily functions. Imagine a battalion of infantrymen advancing across a field. The microwaves are beamed at them and each man suddenly has an attack of diarrhea. It would cripple any ef fort to engage in ground combat. It has been documented that sounds, words, voices, even commands can be beamed into the mind of a pe rson with or without an implanted receiver. There is speculation among authors on mind control that an entire memory sequence of either alien abductions or Satanic cult ritu al abuse can be implanted telepathically or through electromagnetic projection. These memories could be triggered and replayed, complete with em otion, physical sensation, and the voices of people. 139 Even if such induced hallucinations were possible, it seems incredible that thou- sands of experiencers could have similar hallucina tions of repeated alien abduction yet with unique and personal evidence such as nosebleeds, implants, scars, preg- nancy and loss of pregnancy, bedclothes on backwards with bits of leaves and grass stuck to them, and other disturbing physical effects. The next level of this research invol ves mind reading with computer trans- lated brain wave patterns. An implanted co mputer chip would give a person access to computer banks of information, and could be used for direct communication with other persons. The result: computer assisted telepathy. This kind of mind reading was the culmination of a CIA goal, part of Operation Artichoke, 140 the behavior control techniques employing drugs, hypnosis, electroshock, and extra- sensory perception. Devil worship has probably been going on about as long as any form of devotion to a Higher Power, or God. From the time of birth, people are trained to give away their power and authority to an outside agency. First it is parents, who control everything in the infant's life. Later come school teachers, police officers, and political leaders as authority figures. Most people are taught about an unseen God who watches every move and will even tually judge every thought and action. Rebellion against authority naturally begins in childhood, aimed at parental control. Civil disobedience indicates a breaking out of the cultural trance with some par- ticular issue such as racial oppression or Vietnam war protest. Defiance and rejection of God as a ki ngly figure in long robes seated on a throne in heaven can manifest as devil wo rship, or Satanism, the organized form of such activity. Sexual abuse of children is pa rt of the rituals of Satanism. This can cause a condition of multiple personality disorder (MPD), which has been renamed 100"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind dissociative identity disorder (DID), in the victim. 141 Participation in organized Satanic cults often extends through several generations within fa milies, and DID is often seen by therapists as a multi-generational condition. A detailed exploration of Satanism is outside the scope of this volume. 142 According to Bowart and Constantine, the intelligence agencies have been actively involved in cult activity for a long time. 143 The elements of mind control are present: drugs, hypnosis, pain, as well as dabbling in the supernatural. A cult is a ready source of human subjects, people with dissociation disorders who can be controlled and programmed, possibly as spie s or assassins. With the roots of the CIA tracing back to Nazi Ge rmany, by way of the OSS, its predecessor, the obvious question is: \"Which came first, Satanic ritual abuse or the CIA?\" There is no ready answer. There is another element of mind cont rol which is not mentioned in the literature. Even though the intelligence operatives are suspected of involvement with the devil worshippers, I doubt they embrace any notion of actual demons or demon possession. This would be quite an effective instrument of control over others. Curses, hexes, spells, and high black magic are not illusion. Those people who do more than dabble, but plunge head long onto the Dark Path, take on the role of the Black Magicians, and garner for themselves the spiritual (karmic) toll which that practice accrues. One cannot gath er the benefits of such power without suffering the adverse consequences. In our clinical practice over the years, we have discovered the presence of the DFEs in every case of child sexual abuse including Satanic cult ritual abuse. Some claimed they joined the child at a young age, others come in at the time of the abuse. There are always several DFEs with the perpetrators involved in this unbe- lievably hideous and destructive behavior . Given the success of remote spirit releasement in cases of troubled individuals, the technique is used to clear both individuals and groups of perpetrators. With any act of violence, vengeance, a ggression, oppression or willful control of another person, there is DFE influen ce. The cooperation with DFEs may be unwitting and passive, vo luntary, occasionally volitional, or by invitation and full conscious agreement. To establish a pact with the devil may be the single most damaging choice a human being can ever make. 101 "},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"CEVI C h a p t e r 12 ARMAGEDDON OR COSMIC CHESS? The origins of life remain a paramoun t mystery. Religious creationists stand by their belief that God created man in His own image about 5,000 years ago. Does that mean that God possessed all th e faults and defects which humans dis- play? In Revelations 12, it is told that Archangel Michael cast Lucifer from the heavens, along with a third of the stars of heaven, that is, one third of the God- created beings. They were cast into earth, thenceforth manifesting their hatred of God and Jesus Christ through constant attack on human beings. Is the battle of Armageddon an ongoing saga, or will there be a final show- down between the forces of good and evil, Light vs. Darkness? Is it going on right now within human consciousness? In our clinical practice we see an increasing level of activity among the DFEs. They seem to be stepping up the pressure on people. Many therapists who use some fo rm of spirit releasement therapy are reporting similar findings. The activity of the DFE-infested ETs is also increasing. Are these signs of the predicted conflict in the spiritual arena? I have no way of knowing. To interpret the clinical findings as evidence for th e fulfillment of the prophesy of Armageddon would be highly sp eculative and scientifically irrespon- sible. One scientific hypothesis posits that th e building blocks of animal life were formed when high energy electrical discharges fl ashed through the primitive atmo- sphere of earth. This primordial soup contained ammonia, methane, and water, plus many other assorted elements. In su ch a random act of nature, amino acids could form which could then join to produce proteins, DNA, and eventually complicated animal life forms all over this world. As the planet evolved, it seems that about 200 million years we re available for this pro cess. Scientific opinion is split over the length of time necessary for life to form in this manner. Skeptics suggest this sequence of events is as un likely as a Boeing 747 aircraft being as- sembled by a tornado sweeping through a junkyard. The theory that life had an extraterrest rial origin was proposed at the turn of the century by Svante Arrhen ius, a Swedish Nobel laureate in chemistry. He coined the term \"panspermia\" to express his belief that seeds of life exist everywhere in space and are continually showering on the ea rth. A modified version of this theory is advocated by Fred Hoyle, celebrate d British astronomer, and his colleague Chandra Wickramasinghe, an astronomer from Sri Lank a. They claim that viruses and bacteria continually arrive on tails of comets and fall to earth with particles of cometary dust. Some scientists believe that everything from organic chemicals to amino acids may have been carried in by comets, asteroids, and meteorites. Another proposal has been forwarded by Francis Crick, Nobel laureate and co-discoverer of DNA, and Leslie Orgel, a pioneer in prebiotic chemistry.

Zecharia Sitchin is a scholar and author of The Earth Chronicles, 1 * 4 a series of books on his interpretations of various re ligious scriptures and ancient texts. He speaks of the Anunnaki, a group of beings who came to planet earth from their own home planet, Nibiru. The atmosphere of Nibiru was dwindling and they needed gold particles to be suspended in the atmosphere to prevent further loss. They attempted to distill the waters of the Persian Gulf to extract gold, but there was insufficient quantity. They attempted to mine gold from the earth, but the Anunnaki miners rebelled. In Sitchin's view of earth history, En lil was the strict administrator of his peoples here, Enki was the overseer of the mining operation. His solution was to create a Primitive Worker. Ancient Mesopotam ian texts describe the process. The \"essence\" of the blood of a young Anunnaki male was mixed with the egg of an earth-born hominid (perhaps the Neanderthal) , and this fertilized egg was placed in the womb of a young Anunnaki female. Afte r much trial and error, the \"Model Man\" was born. Was this the first human/ alien hybrid? There is a description of this process in the Book of Genesis which states that Humankind was created by Elohim, \"male and fema le created He them.\" 145 William Bramley discovered more than he wanted to know through his research into the origins and causes of war. 146 He described what he termed \"Cus- todians,\" beings capable of apparently supe rnatural feats who have been in control of much of human behavior for a very long time. War among factions weakens all of those involved, and turns attention away from the Custodians. Kings and rulers of older times traditionally relied on their own agents provocateur to incite \"con- trollable unrest\" in their kingdoms in or der to promote factions in the populace who would blame each ot her—instead of the kings—for their misery. 147 There are several theories which postulate that the human race has been genetically engineered or manipulated numbers of time s through the millennia in order to produce slaves or perfect workers. There are some obvious gaps in the sequence of evolution which leads to homo sapiens sapiens. Who were the scien- tists who conducted this project? Are th ey continuing to a lter the DNA structure of our species through some process of hybridization? Will human beings, as we know ourselves today, be only another extinct species in the ladder of evolution? Is such a program still underway? Is there anything we can do about it? At a 1993 MUFON Conferen ce in Richmond, Virginia , Vladimir Terzinsky presented his theory that humans have been under the control of an non-human \"Management System\" for a very long time. If these theories and speculations have any basis in fact, then it would seem that human beings, for all our evolutionary advances, our consciousness that supposedly separates us from \"lower\" animals, our great technological achievements, are deluded pawns in a sinister game of cosmic proportion.

However, they never claim responsibility for the events for which these authors give them credit. As arrogant as the DFEs are when we encounter them, they would certainly lay claim to these accomplish- ments. Author Martin Cannon offe rs a new hypothesis of alien abductions. He draws from established psychological information on hypnosis, perceptions during altered states of consciousness, screen memories , and \"brainwashing.\" He describes the projects of the CIA and other intelligence agencies, mentions research on brain implants and other mind control methods, su ch as brain entrainment and electro- magnetic radiation. He speculates broadly on the possibility that abduction experi- ences are nothing more than induced halluci nations and that the extraterrestrial hypothesis is the province of the uncritical Believers. He acknowledges that his own hypothesis remains far from proven. Author and artist Budd Hopkins makes th e point that in his files he has reports of classic abduction cases which date from 1929. 148 This was before any thought of a CIA. A colleague reported a strange clinical case. During a past life therapy ses- sion, a female client located a lifetime as a cave dweller. This is not unusual. Clients sometimes find the source of a pr esent life problem in a very primitive setting. This seems to be the first \"human\" experience on the planet. As the client described her activities in the lifetime, she suddenly found he rself being taken up into a craft. She proceeded to outline a classic UFO abduction, after which she was returned to the ground, quite confused. This is only one case, which does not establish a pattern, just a very interesting possibility. Dr. Cory Hammond, in his disturbing Gree nbaum lecture, states that Allen Dulles, director of the Office of Strategi c Services, or OSS, at the end of World War II, and others from the intelligence community, were arra nging to get Nazi scientists out of Europe. Not only did they procure the rocket scientists, but also Nazi doctors involved in mind control research in the camps. 149 The Nazi doctors, Hammond claims, were Satanists. The CI A was established by the National Secu- rity Act in 1947. Its first director was Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter. Presumably, the German doctors were pressed into duty at the CIA and the mind control 104"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind techniques developed by the Nazis were put to use in the serv ice of the United States. 150 In our clinical practice, we have he ard narratives, through the voices of many hundreds of our clients, ostensibly from le aders of alien civilizations who formed alliances with other more powerful and resourceful beings. These \"others\" prom- ised great benefits to the peoples of th ose civilizations. They also promised ex- panded power to the leaders and greater c ontrol over the citizens, not only of their dwn homeworld, but of other worlds of people they might find and overcome. Most of these agreements were formed w ith the dark forces, shape-shifters who can appear in most benevolent forms. Th e needy, greedy rulers naively accepted the terms of the deceptive DFEs. Once such an agreement is in place, the DFEs simply take over. There is precedent for su ch a pact with the dark forces, not only among the ordinary people of Earth, but also with the political leaders. Adolph Hitler actively courted the power of the dark forces. 151 There is no doubt he was in league with the forces of darkness, and this plague devastated the people of Germany and other nearby European countries for many years. He rose from political obscurity to become the un disputed ruler of a powerful nation. The atrocities committed under this regime s hocked the world. Details are still coming into public awareness. Some UFO investigators have suggested that the U.S. government formed an alliance with alie ns shortly after World War II ended. 152 Allegedly, the agreement outlined an exchange of alie n technology for the right to experiment on humans. If there is any truth in this, it means our ow n leaders betrayed the individual freedoms and right to self-determination that were the foundation of th e country over two centuries ago. Is it possible that our own government ha s established secret agreements with aliens? From my experience over the years with many clients in altered states of consciousness utilizing natural psychic an d clairvoyant abilities to explore such questions, it seems the logical conclusion. Has the United States Government been actively involved with off-pla net beings, extraterrestrials, aliens? Has the medium of exchange for alien technology been the liv es of the free citizens of our country? In session, we don't ask specific questions regarding such activity; the ETs chan- neling through the voice of the c lients divulge such information. Most cases of ET attachment involve DFEs. The connection with these entities often spans lifetimes; this intrus ive activity has been going on for a long time. It seems that only in recent decades the governments of perhaps several nations have been contacted by the other-worldly beings, ETs, for the purpose of establishing some agreements which could be mutually profitab le. For the aliens, such a cooperative venture would make their activities much easier and more productive. If government officials, at a highly s ecret level, have established friendly contact with aliens, created formal agr eements for trade of technology, then the citizens, under control of th e government, are fair game for the alien scientists and colonists, as described in earlier chapters . As we have heard in so many clinical 105"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"CEVI sessions, nearly all the intrus ive aliens are infested with , and controlled by, DFEs. I feel certain that government agents and military personnel would not any harbor any belief in the reality of DFEs, nor would they acknowledge the existence of dark force entities, the classic demon. Therefore, the dark force/alien connection remains unknown, unseen, unchallenged, and able to wreak havoc with our social system. After years of experience in exploring the further reaches of consciousness with clients in altered states, I have come to accept the existence of levels or states of reality other than our normal, thr ee-dimensional world. The events I have described in this book take place in thes e paranormal levels of reality. Remote viewing, the NDE, the OOBE, precognition, clairvoyance, spiritual healing, and other paranormal events are perfectly normal in these realities. The mystics have described these realities for ce nturies, even millennia, ph ysicists have only recently discovered this territory. Can something be done to ward off this invasion? Yes, people can do some- thing, for themselves and for each other. With the te chniques of Past Life Therapy, Recovery of Soul Fragmentation, Spirit Releasement Therapy, Extraterrestrial Releasement Therapy, and remote Spirit Releasement Therapy, the ETs and DFEs can be discovered and released appropria tely. The people who choose this work, as a vocation or avocation, will be doing a great and se lfless service for humanity. It has been said that we are our brother's keeper, and beyond that, we are our brother. The rewards are beyond comprehension. 106"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind EPILOGUE There is one Power in the universe of universes. It is the path of light, love, forgiveness, healing, and spiritual evolu tion. The power of the Light/Love can be distorted and misused by anyone with su ch miscreant intention to damage or destroy other God-created beings. This abus e is a violation of the free will of the victim, the person who is the object of the di storted force. It also violates the basic nature of the perpetrator; to misuse the Power of the Light is to incur severe karmic debt. Over the years clients have discovered the same dark force entities showing up in past lives down through the centuries, in every instance of black magic, Satan worship, sorcery, spells, curses, and ritual magic of every sort. This has been consistent in every human activity, organization or institution which exerted power and control over others, whether by one individual or a group of individuals. Clients who recall existence on other plan ets describe the same DFEs, connected with the same Luciferian source. In every human drama there is one recurrent theme: conflict between good and evil. Clearly evident in the tragedies, less malevolent in the comedies. So many love stories are made the more poignant through the intrusion of the dark forces. And more triumphant in overcoming that intrusion. Does love triumph? It seems an uphill struggle, yet as a past lives therapist, I see that long struggle heading inexorably toward a culmination in the Light. We came from that ineffable Creator Source, and we are goi ng Home. We are a ll going Home eventually. None will be left behind, none will be left out. Not even the DFEs. Perhaps the Lucifer energy is the ultima te prodigal son. Leaving in rebellion, causing unfathomable chaos an d destruction in his wrath, finally coming home and being welcomed back into the fold. Forgiveness and love are the healing powers of the Light. We come into this existence with a Life script for the present life. If we can uncover our future lives as well as past lives, it would seem the play is already written, and we add only minor variations to the script along the way. Other elements or forces can alte r the flow of the drama, yet we are still heading in the direction of Home. No thing can alter that. The Bard William Shakespeare once wrote, \"All the world is but a stage and we the players on it.\" His view was limited; the universe is the stage! What a magnificent drama we have scripted! 107"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"CEVI APPENDIX UFO Matrix of Belief The following is a matrix of the spectrum of scenarios found in current literature which are used to try to explain so-called UFO or ETI (extraterrestrial intelligence) activity, or the lack thereof. Each matrix entry has a supporting co nstituency. Some of these constituencies are quite vocal, and others less so, but each is apparently confident that their current belief structures are the most reasonable, given the data which are generally accepted. There most certainly is a large minority whic h is not willing to commit to one matrix entry over another, or in combination, until additional data are available. 0. All sightings except for a small minority which lack detail can be explained in terms of naturally occurring phenomena. 1. Craft from off planet, but from the visible universe. 2. Interdimensional penetrations by intell igent life-forms, based in or operating from another (parallel) overlapping dimension than our own space-time. 3. Earth-based \"others,\" referenced thro ughout history, who may be other life- forms, or predominately resident in realms or dimensions we term spiritual. 4. Hoaxes or dramatic scenarios perpetrated by various intelligence organizations as part of broader security or disinformation campaigns. 5. Broader social engineering, or popul ation mind-influencing programs, designed to promote a more universal planetary consciousness and to reduce the influence of nationalistic or religious traditions. 6. Any combination of the above, including \"all of the above.\" Intent: unknown. Possible U.S. Government levels of awareness, involvement and/or control of the phenomena termed UFO. 0. No activity, inasmuch as the phenomen a are explained by naturally occurring events. 1. Aware, but not directly involved or in contact with the perpetrating forces. 2. In contact to some degree, and coopera ting with at least some of the source- phenomena or entities, either for technology trading or because government believes it has no choice. 3. Government is the perpetrator of at least some of the phenomenology, perhaps drawing on the source experience for ideas and methods, but employing the events for other purposes, such as intelligence, disinformation or to alarm other nations. 4. At least some UFO phenomena are results of government or other agency sponsored experiments in mind-control, or social control experiments or initiatives. Note: The Human Potential Foundation, Inc. does not endorse any of the entries of the preceding Matrix of Be lief. The Matrix has been prepared to stimulate discus- sion and research into the broad spectrum of ideas that are represented in current literature addressing what are popularly known as UFO phenomena.

Jenny Randies has produced several fine books on the history of UFOs and abduction including: Alien Contacts and Abductions. Michael Craft has produced an intelligent, far-reaching survey of UFO, ET, and related subject matter in his book, Alien Impact. 2 For the first time, the Fourth Edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, (1994), assembled and by the Ameri can Psychiatric Association, included a category of Religious or Spiritual Problem , (p. 685). 3 Memories, Dreams, Reflections, by C. G. Jung was recorded and edited by Aniela Jaffe, translated from the German by Richard and Clara Winston. It gives us an intimate glimpse into the brilliant mind of this man who deeply influe nced contemporary psychological thinking, and a hint of his thinking and feeling about the spiritual aspects of consciousness. 4 SETI is the government-funded program designed to search for radio signals from intelli- gent sources outside earth. 5 According to a 1991 Roper poll, perhaps 2 percent of the American people, or about 5 million Americans, have experienced events cons istent with those that abductees experienced before they knew they were abducted. The survey was constructed by David Jacobs and Budd Hopkins. See The Threat by David Jacobs, Ph.D. 6 Authors Budd Hopkins, Karla Turner, David Jacobs, Whitley Strieber, Edith Fiore, Raymond Fowler, Kim Carlsberg, John Mack, and many others have written about the intrusive, physically and emotionally traumatic events which have been labeled UFO abductions. 7 Stan Grof, M.D. has explored human consciousness perhaps more extensively than any other investigator. His books describe his work and many of these phenomena. See Realms of the Human Unconscious: Observations from LSD Research, and Beyond The Brain. 8 Author Eugene Taylor has done much to stimul ate interest in James' concept of \"radical empiricism.\" 9 Reincarnation in some form is an integral part of 80% of the world's religious teachings. The concept of karma and reincarnation offer a method of balancing cause and effect. The Golden Rule \"As you sow, so shall you reap\" is a clear expression of karma in action. Past life therapy is based on the notion that present life pr oblems and conflicts stem from traumatic events in prior lifetimes. Uncovering these traumatic memories in a therapy session can begin the process of healing the past and improving the present. 10 The notion of possession, or control of a living being by a non-physical consciousness, or entity, has been known or theorized in every time and every culture. The first recorded instance was found on a clay tablet in Assyrian cuneiform text some 2500 years ago. See Hoyt's Exorcism. 11 The Bardos, or mental states of a person in the transition from living in the earth plane through dying and being reborn into the etheric planes, are well described in two classic works: Tibetan Book of the Dead, and Egyptian Book of the Dead. George Meek, a retired engineer, discovered and described the higher vibrational planes of existence while working on an elec- tronic device he dubbed \"spiricom,\" designed for communication between humans and the spirit world. His depiction of the spiritual regions is similar to the accepted \"map of the territory\" described in esoteric literature. See After We Die, What Then? Emanuel Swedenborg (1688-1722) wrote many volumes describing his explorations of the non-physical realms. One classic is Heaven and Hell. 12 See Gauld, The Founders of Psychical Discord, pp. 3-31. 13 This term was coined by Rev. Judith A. Baldwin and is the subject of a forthcoming book, one of a series of mini-volumes on pr actical spirituality in everyday life. 14 Near death experiencers describe the golden-wh ite light which they perceive as approach- ing them or surrounding them as they leave the body.

The descriptions match. The newl y deceased spirit moves in to a brilliant golden- white light, flooded with an overwhelming sense of pure love. Except when they don't. 15 Brinsley LePoer Trench produ ced a scholarly book entitled: The Sky People. 16 TV Guide, August 24, 1996. 17 Ralph Allison, M.D., Minds in Many Pieces; Adam Crabtree, Ph.D., Multiple Man; Ken McAll, M.D., Healing the Family Tree; Arthur Guirdham, M.D., The Psychic Dimensions of Mental Health; Edith Fiore, Ph.D., The Unquiet Dead; William Baldwin, Ph.D., Spirit Releasement Therapy: A Technique Manual. The December, 1993 issue of DISSOCIATION, the Journal of the International Society for the Study of Dissociation was devoted entirely to the subjects of possession and exorcism. This is the professional Journal of Multiple Personal Disorder. 1 These are very effective inductions into an alte red state of consciousness. The affect bridge connects the client to another time when they felt the same emotions as in the present moment. It is described as a method of experientially moving a client from a present to a past incident over an affect, that is, an emotion or feeling, which is common to both events rather than through an overlapping idea or mental concept in the manner of psychoanalytic association. The somatic bridge connects to an event which is the source of the body memory that is surfacing as physical sensation in the session. The linguistic bridge is triggered by repetition of the metaphoric phrase the client uses to describe the problem or conflict. The metaphoric phrase is usually a literal description of the earlier trauma. These emotions, body memories, and metaphoric descriptions emerge from the subconscious mind, the re pository of all reme mbered experience. 19 Spirit Releasement Therapy: A Technique Manual is the first textbook , or teaching manual, on Regression Therapy which includes Past Life Therapy, Recovery of Soul Fragmentation, and Spirit Releasement Therapy. Past life therapy has several essential steps: 1. identification into the past-life character; 2. resolution or processing the conflict; 3. the after-death experience; 4. disidentification from the past-life character. Recovery of soul fragmentation requires several steps: 1. discovery of the broken places, the em pty spaces, the voids in one's essence; 2. location of the soul fragment that split off from that pl ace; 3. resolution of the conflict which led to the fragmentation; 4. recovery and reintegration of the fragment. Spirit Releasement Therapy has six distinct steps: 1. discovery of all attached entitie s of the various types; 2. differential diagnosis and identification of which type it is; 3. dialogu e with the entities to determine the cause of the attachment and to resolve any conflicts which still hold the entity attached; 4. the releasement process specific to each type of entity; 5. a guided imagery of light to metaphorically fill the etheric space left by the departing entities (there is never just one); 6. ongoing therapy to strengthen the resistance to further attachments. Much of this body of knowledge and many of the clinical techniques were developed by the author. 20 According to many personal accounts over the years, the alien intruders appear to defy the laws of physics which govern our earthly existence. They move through solid walls, they levitate, regardless of gravity, they appear and disappear from view, yet they can interact with the physical bodies of the contactee or abductee. 21 A concise explanation of Freudian psychology is contained in the little book, A Primer of Freudian Psychology, by Calvin Hall. Freud's writings were extensive, and though some of the concepts he set forth have been challenged, even dismissed in recent decades, he had enormous impact on the field of human psychology. 22 Repression is the active process of keeping out and ejecting, banishing from consciousness, ideas or impulses that are unacceptable to it. For example, a son may feel hate for his father. Both the idea of hating father and the emotion associated with the idea may be repressed. The hate may be transferred to another authority figure, and the father figure may become an object of love by the son. Thus can repressed memories be altered and distorted. (Campbell, p. 546) 23 For an intense in-depth look at birth and its effect on our lives, Stan Grof s book, Beyond the Brain is not to be missed. 116"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind 24 David Cheek, M.D. was a practicing obstetrician -gynecologist for over 30 years. He retired from that field and focused on hypnotherapy. As president of the American Society for Clinical Hypnosis, he assisted in training hundreds of phys icians, psychologists, and dentists in the art of clinical hypnosis. As a continuing research project, he kept careful medical records of deliveries he performed. In later years, he used regression hypnosis with many of his \"babies\" to assist them in recalling their birth experience. These teenagers and young adults were able to accu- rately describe details of their own deliveries! 25 There is a growing literature on the subject of pre- and peri-natal memories and therapy: Nandor Fodor, 1949, The Search for the Beloved; Frederick Leboyer, 1975, Birth Without Violence; Leslie Feher, 1981, The Psychology of Birth; Thomas Verny, 1982, The Secret Life of the Unborn Child; Arthur Janov, 1983, Imprints; Thomas Verny, 1987, Pre- and Perinatal Psychology; Michael Gabriel, 1992, Voices From The Womb. 26 Birth regression and Pre-and Perinatal ther apy are well established modalities, used by therapists in many countries. A professional organization called the Association for Pre- and Perinatal Psychology and Health is dedicated to the study of pregnancy, reproduction, and the mental and emotional health of the unborn and the newborn. 27 Sandra Ingerman wrote a lovely book, Soul Retrieval, which describes this healing method used by shamans in indigenous cultures across the world. She discovered the condition in her own female clients who described \"psychically leaving the body\" when they were being sexually abused. 28 The DSM-IV, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, is published by the American Psychiatric Association. All known and recognized mental and emotional disorders are described, named, and given a code number. Some of the names are changed with each new edition of the book. Me ntal health practitioners use this system for diagnosis and for insurance purposes. 29 William James, the father of modern psychology, described the \"various selves\" of the human personality in Volume Two of his monumental work, The Principles Of Psychology. 30 Psychosynthesis is the psychological system which best describes subpersonalities, their source, effects, and treat ment. Robert Assagioli, a contemporary of Freud and Jung, broke away from the limits of psychoanalysis as set by Freud and developed this more spiritual model of the human personality. His book, Psychosynthesis, is the classic work on th e subject. Piero Ferrucci expanded on the theme in his book, What We May Be. 31 The subpersonality is described as a structured conste llation of attitudes, drives, habit patterns, and belief systems, organized in adaptation to forces in the internal and external environment. It is considered to be crystallized energy that is \"split off from the whole of the personality, usually at a young age, as a result of some unmet basic need or drive or emotional trauma. It remains intact at that same age, diligently attempting to meet the original unmet need, even though many years pass. See Martha Crampton in Corsini's Handbook of Innovative Therapies. 32 Robert Monroe described the out-of-body experience in his books, Journeys Out Of The Body, Far Journeys, and The Ultimate Journey. Many other books have been written on the subject. 33 The silver cord is described in the Bible, Ecclesiastes 12:6. 34 Grof and Halifax, Life After Death 1976. 35 Taylor, 1984, William James on Excepti onal Mental States: The 1896 Lowell lectures, p. 110. 36 The first book on recovering memories of past lives under hypnosis was published in France in 1911, written by a Frenchman, Col. Al bert de Rochas. In 1942, Asa Roy Martin self published his book on the subject entitled, Researches in Reincarnation and Beyond. In 1955, Morey Bernstein wrote his book on his hypnosis experience with a Colorado woman entitled, The Search For Bridey Murphy. In 1978, books by Edith Fiore, Morris Netherton, Helen Wambach, and Dick Sutphen were published on the clinical application of past life regression. Since then, dozens of books have been written on the subject . There is a professional organization called the 117"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"CEVI Association for Past-life Research and Therapies, Inc., dedicated to promoting the field of Past Life Therapy through educational conferences held twice a year in the U.S. The organization is headquartered in Riverside, California. 37 The near-death experience, or NDE, was first described in a book by Raymond Moody, Life After Life. A 1982 Gallup poll indicated that as many as 8 million Americans were near-death experiencers. A later poll indicated as many as 11 million NDEers. 38 Future life progressions are described in Past Lives, Future Lives by Bruce Goldberg, D.D.S., and Mass Dreams of the Future by Chet Snow, Ph.D. 39 June Bletzer has produced a monumental volume entitled, The Donning International Encyclopedic Psychic Dictionary. This definition of the monad can be found on page 408. 40 Psychologist Helen Wambach wrote Life Before Life, based on surveys of several thousand people from all across the country that she regressed to the Planning Stage. 41 The concept of karma is similar to the notion of \"an eye for an eye,\" and \"As you sow, so shall you reap.\" It is equivalent to the Golden Rule: \"Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.\" 42 Canadian psychiatrist Joel Whitton, with Joe Fisher, wrote Life Between Life, an excellent book about the \"Scientific explorations into the void separating one incarnation from the next.\" (From the cover.) 43 From Hinduism and Buddhism, the notion of a circular Mandala which represents mankind's karma, resulting in birth, death, and repeated rebirths. It has three hub outgrowths symbolizing ignorance, lust, and anger. It has four spokes symbolizing gods, demigods, tortured souls, and human beings. The circle is emblematic of immortality and based on the theory that all people are shackled to this wheel of life, death, and rebirth until all karma is balanced. (Bletzer, p. 680) 44 Scott Mandelker, Ph.D. has written of this phenomenon in his book, From Elsewhere: Being E. T. in America. He describes Wanderers and Walk-ins. 45 This session is available on cassette tape. There is an irritating static on the tape, which is typical of the sessions involving ETs. 46 Clare Sylvia has written an interesting book, A Change Of Heart, on her experience of having a heart and lung transplant. She describes a dream of inhaling \"Tim\" after a deep kiss. She seeks many explanations for her post-surgery desire for beer and chicken nuggets. She gingerly skirts the issue of sp irit attachment, describing it as \"preposterous.\" Tim, the organ donor, was killed on his motorcycle with a bag of chicken nuggets in his jacket pocket. He normally drank beer with such a meal. We have seen similar cases in which the entity joined at the time of the organ transplant. 47 The aura is the energy field surrounding and penetrating the body. There are many good books on the subject. 48 The chakra system consists of the major energy centers of the body and has to do with gathering and utilizing cosmic energy. Chakra is a Sanskrit word meaning wheel of light. Healer Rosalyn Bruyere wrote an excellent book entitled Wheels of Light: A Study Of The Chakras describing the chakras, the aura, and the UCLA research project on auras conducted by herself and Dr. Valerie Hunt. The book Yoga and Psychotherapy: The Evolution of Consciousness is a most worthwhile treatise on the subject. 49 Fiore, Edith, (September, 1987), The Unquiet Dead. Lecture presented at the Seventh Annual Fall Conference of the Association for Pa st-life Research and Therapies, Sacramento, CA. At this lecture, Dr. Fiore announced her clinical findings that nearly 100% of the population is affected by entities. The audience, mostly practicing therapists (who usually think they have it all together) went deathly quiet. It felt like the air had suddenly turned to concrete. She then said, \"Well almost 100%.\" There was a palpable sigh of relief from the audience. 50 Malachi Martin's book, Hostage To The Devil, is an informative volume on the Catholic views of demon possession and exorcism. The Roman Ritual of Exorcism is included in an appendix. 51 Francis MacNutt is a well established Ch ristian healer and exorcist. His book, Deliverance 118"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind From Evil Spirits, is a clearly presented discourse on his experience of deliverance ministry. He offers training for deliverance mi nisters in Jacksonville, Florida. Deliverance Prayer, by Mat- thew and Dennis Linn is a collection of essays wh ich explore deliverance prayer in tradition, in practice, and in the light of contemporary psychology. Pigs In The Parlor: A Practical Guide To Deliverance, by Frank and Ida Mae Hammond is considered a classic work on the practice of deliverance. 52 See Brandon, The Spiritualists. 53 The Spiritualist philosophy was expanded in Europe with the publication of two books by Hippolyte Leon Denizard Rivail under the pseudonym Allan Kardec: The Spirit's Book, in 1875, and The Medium's Book, in 1876. Both are channeled works and considered of high spiritual quality. Spiritism became th e popular name of this expanded work. The term Kardecism grew out of Rivail's work, and this philosophy also became popular in Brazil. 54 Carl Wickland, a psychiatrist, was an avid Spiritualist. His wife, Anna, was a gifted medium. He chronicled his work in two books, Thirty Years Among The Dead, and The Gateway to Understanding. He is the grandfather of Spirit Releasem ent Therapy. His wo rk is the founda- tion upon which this author built the methodology of SRT. 55 Spirit Releasement Therapy: A Technique Manual, 2nd ed. (West Virginia: Headline Books, Inc., 1992) was the first published text on the clinical approach to releasing attached entities. It was also one of the first books on the techniques of Past Life Therapy. Writing this 480 page book was a labor of love. I had worked in clinical practice for 10 years, developing many of the techniques by trial and error (and much cour se correction) when I began writing. Whenever I lectured or taught on the subject, people asked for a book. I finally did it! The work continues to expand and our knowledge continues to grow. 56 Many books have been written in recent years on the inner child. Abrams, Bradshaw, Whitfield, and many others have contributed to this field. 57 These figures come from a medical textbook entitled: Pathology of the Human Placenta, by Kurt Kenirschke and Peter Kaufmann, page 680. 58 This is from a paper delivered at the International Forum on New Science, Fort Collins, Colorado, September 15, 1995. 59 See Adam Crabtree's Multiple Man, a classic in multiple personality and possession. 60 See Ralph Allison's Minds in Many Pieces, a pioneering work by a psychiatrist on multiple personality and possession. 61 MacDonald, J. (1964). \"Suicide and Homicide by Automobile.\" American Journal of Psychiatry, 121. 62 Every such combination is possible. A treasure house of information in this field is Ander- son Reed's Shouting At The Wolf. 63 The shadow is described as the darker personal side of each human being, that which is dreadful or evil and disapproved of by the conscious mind. This was one of the notions put forth by the great psychiatrist, Carl Jung (Cox, 1968, pp. 142-144). 64 Complete discussion and instruction on the six steps of SRT can be found in Spirit Releasement Therapy: A Te chnique Manual, 2nd edition, by William Baldwin. (1992). 65 These beings were other-worldly and other-dimensional. As a rough analogy, consider a turtle as being very solid, physically, and a jelly fish, physical yet translucent, soft, pliable, vulnerable. Some jellyfish have long streamers which carry nematocysts, the tiny stingers which are primarily for the purpose of killing small pr ey, though they can inflict painful wounds on humans. The ET beings can shift dimensions and disappear completely from our visual percep- tion. 66 Anthropologist Michael Harner described shamanism and journeying in his fine little book, The Shaman's Way. 67 Jon Klimo wrote Channeling, the most thorough and brilliantly written book on channeling that exists anywhere. 68 Schwarz, Harary, Puthoff, and Targ established the field of remote viewing at SRI, Stanford Research Institute. Jim Schnabel has written a very clear exposition of remote viewing, Remote 119"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"CEV1 Viewers: The Secret History of America's Psychic Spies. Joe McMoneagle's book, Mind Trek, is an excellent personal account by one of the best re mote viewers produced by the U.S. Army. Both books mention Lyn Buchanan, also one of the best RVers to come out of the army program. Lyn now teaches CRV, controlled remote viewing, using the protocols of the original program. The only authorized CRV trainers have been trained by Lyn. 69 Larry Dossey, author of Healing Words: The Power of Prayer and the Practice of Medi- cine, gathered information on the power of prayer in remote healing. He was surprised to find well documented studies showing the undeniable resu lts of prayer, even when the receivers were unaware of the prayer being directed to them. 70 This is where physics and metaphysics intertwine. In 1964 Irish physicist John Stewart Bell took a sabbatical from the fast-paced world of high energy physics at CERN, the European accelerator center in Geneva, Switzerland, to explore the byways of quantum physics. His exploration led him to formulate what has become known as Bell's Theorem. Essentially, everything is connected to everything else, wit hout regard to physical distance, time, or space which apparently separates everything. The connection is instant, immediate, and eternal. Remote healing occurs, remote viewing can be accurate to a large degree, clairvoyance and precognition can be verified, a pair of electrons which separate will act as if they are still in contact, no matter where in the universe they travel. Speed of light does not govern these non- local phenomena. The facts of quantum physics have proved Bell's Theorem; it does not rely on quantum theory. See Quantum Reality by Nick Herbert. 71 Universal Oneness or Universal Consciousness is considered to be the Divine Conscious- ness, the one total awareness that is conscious of being. Everything in the universe (of universes) is a part of, and belongs to, the \"one\" consciousness of being. Every animate and inanimate thing consists of consciousness, some of lesser, some of greater degree; the universal awareness is distributed in all things, unevenly, in accordance with the nature of the thing, each with enough awareness to know its \"function.\" Everything is aware that it is connected to the mother con- sciousness, and to some this awareness of connection is more acute. From Bletzer's Encyclopedic Psychic Dictionary, (p. 658). 72 In his book, The Medium, the Mystic, and the Physicist, Lawrence LeShan describes the Clairvoyant Reality as the Universal Oneness in which a psychic or healer can perceive all things, all people, all events, all time as a unity in the present moment, but out of any time stream. He expanded this concept through his own personal experiences and named the state of consciousness the Transpsychic Reality. In this state of consciousness one knows that everything, including oneself, is a part of the One, of the All, (p. 149). 73 The late Carl Sagan, a brilliant astronomer, prolific author, and the man who brought astronomy into our living rooms with the popular TV series Cosmos, speculated on the vastness of the universe and the probability of life on other planets. Within some hundred billion galaxies, each with an average of a hundred billion stars, there are perhaps as many planets as stars, about ten billion trillion. With billions and billions of stars and billions and billions of planets, it seemed likely to Sagan that the universe is brimming over with life. Perhaps he is exploring some of those places right now. 74 George C. Andrews, Extra-terrestrials Among Us.

For many, there seemed to be a spiritual gift inherent in the 120 "},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Close Encounters of the Possession Kind experience. 83 Budd Hopkins, Missing Time, Intruders; and Witnessed; David Jacobs, Secret Life. Budd Hopkins maintains an organization devoted to the subject of UFO abduction: Intruders Founda- tion, PO Box 30233, New York, NY 10011. 84 The typical abduction experience includes many of these events. The common elements of UFO abduction are described and delineated in David Jacobs' book The Secret Life, (pp. 49 - 236.) 85 Karla Turner, Ph.D., Into The Fringe, and Taken. 86 Raymond E. Fowler, The Watchers, (pp. 148-152, 344-345, 349, 355). 87 The French Islamic scholar Henry Corbin coined the term imaginal, distinct from imagi- nary. 88 Ken Ring briefly describes the imaginal real m in connection with NDEs and UFO abduc- tion in his book, The Omega Project, (pp. 218-219, and 221). This is a fascinating concept and beyond the scope of this volume. 89 This was a private session and the subject, Laura (not her real name), gave permission to make the tape of the session available as a teaching aid. 90 John Mack is a professor of psychiatry at Harvard University and a Pulitzer Prize winner for his earlier book about Laurence of Arabia. More recently, he has authored Abduction, a compilation of case histories of UFO abductees. Even with his credentials, he has been harshly criticized by mental health professionals for d ealing in this questionable arena. His tenure at Harvard was even challenged. This doesn't say much for the University mentality, which should be focused on the search for truth on whatever new horizons which emerge. 91 See Psychiatric Dictionary, fifth ed., by Robert Campbell, M.D.,(p. 380). 92 The New Testament, Revelations 12: 7-12, 17, tells the story of Lucifer being cast from Heaven and hurled down to earth by Archangel Michael. One third of the stars of Heaven followed him, that is, one third of the God-created beings accompanied the one called Lucifer, which means \"Light Bearer.\" This dragon was enraged with the \"woman\" (universal mother) and went away to make war on the rest of her children (human beings). Is it metaphorical, is it archetypal, is it symbolic of human consciousness? 93 Described by David Jacobs in his book, Secret Life, the alien/human hybrid experimenta- tion is truly mind boggling, (pp. 87-131). In his later book, THE THREAT, Jacobs goes on to expose what he sees as the frightening plans for earth and its inhabitants. In stark and somber analysis of over 100 cases of alien abduction, he unveils a chilling picture of our profoundly changed future in which humans will be relegated to an inferior status in a world dominated by aliens. He reveals evidence that: 1. The aliens ar e creating a breed of alien-human \"hybrids.\" 2. The aliens protect the secrecy of the breeding program. 3. Alien-human hybridization is at the center of the abduction phenomenon, not just an experimental adjunct. 4. The aliens are in the process of integrating into our planet. Jacobs o ffers evidence that the alien presence is far from benevolent, as some researchers claim, but is, instead, profoundly ominous. He states: \"Now I fear for the future of my own children.\" He offers no real solution, and sees little hope for the future of humanity. He has been unawa re of Spirit Rel easement Therapy. 94 Budd Hopkins' Intruders describes \"Kathie's\" experience of abduction, including the removal of her unborn infant. This is a landmark volume, revealing this disturbing aspect of UFO activity. 95 Lyssa Royal and Keith Priest have published some fascinating books on such speculations, particularly Visitors from Within. 96 John Mack, in Abduction, suggests the interaction with aliens is part of a transformational, spiritual evolution process for humankind. 97 See The Complete Book Of Devils And Demons, by Leonard R. N. Ashley, (pp. 235-237). 98 Raymond Fowler's book, The Watchers, chronicles the abduction experiences of Betty Andreasson Luca.

On page 267 of her book, Taken, she describes several experiencers who have refused to cooperate with the intruders. Kim Carlsberg gives a short chapter in her book, Beyond My Wildest Dreams, entitled \"How to Stop Abduction,\" (278-282). 104 Fiore, Edith, Encounters. 105 See Abductions by John Mack, M.D. 106 Janet Bergmark, in her book, In The Presence Of Aliens, describes what she calls \"a Personal Experience of Dual Consciousness.\" She is describing exactly the condition of attach- ment by an ET. In the Foreword, her therapist mentioned spirit attachment and spirit releasement, yet the book contains no such in formation. There are specific SRT techniques for identifying and releasing such attachments. 107 David Jacobs describes this process in Secret Life. 108 This is the third book written by Dr. Fiore. Her first was You Have Been Here Before; A Psychologist Looks At Past Lives, the second was The Unquiet Dead: A Psychologist Treats Spirit Possession. These three books reflect her clinical ex perience with past life memories, cases of possession, and alien abductions. Writing them reveals her great courage in the face of professional criticism. 109 Karla Turner has written three fine books a bout the darker side of alien abduction: Into The Fringe, Taken, and Masquerade of Angels. The experience of her family and the others she describes ranges from unpleasant to terrifying. 110 Kim Carlsberg describes her experience of abduction beautifully and poetically in her book Beyond My Wildest Dreams. Her experiences over a number of years include producing a human/ alien hybrid baby girl. Toward the end of the b ook, she states how she truly despises the aliens for abducting her, yet how she appreciates the way her consciousness has been stretched through the process.

As used in this chapter and in this book, it may be considered as a symbolic metaphor, an archetypal figure drawn from human experience and the collective unconsciousness. 117 An interesting description of the Pact with the Devil can be found in Ruth Nanda Anshen's The Reality of the Devil: Evil in Man, (pp. 49-56). 118 Wicca was the earth religion, the witch was the practitioner. The witch was the healer, knowledgeable about herbs, conversant with sp irits. This often frightened the ignorant and superstitious folk. It was often the father of a ch ild healed by the witch who leveled charges of witchcraft and \"trafficking with the devil\" against the gentle woman. In her expanded loving nature, she might have also granted him sexual favors. The guilt and self-recrimination would be too much for the man.

He also supplied good background on the exorcism procedures of the Catholic Church, including this fact on page 200. 122 Contained in the New Testament, Revelations 12 gives us an account of the rebellion and the eviction of Lucifer. 123 These great Light Beings are universal and eternal; they are not associated with any particular organized church or religion. Human beings in the past have developed the rules and restrictions of organized religions around misperceptions, misinterpretations, fear, magical thinking, philosophical dogma, and individual beliefs. They have attempted to claim certain elevated spirit beings as property of their chur ches. This is the arrogance of the human ego. 126 Emmanuel Swedenborg explored the inner realms of the spiritual reality during extensive deep meditation. He described a vast taxonomy of beings.

There was a definite correlation.

Suggesting that there is no evidence, which is false, and the \"memories\" of victims are invalid, which is patently arrogant and uninformed opinion, Victor's work might be seen as a parallel to the debunking of UFO contact and abduction.
